    "the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) is one of the most puzzling problems in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "it is certain that the minimal standard model ( msm ) can not account for its origin .",
    "there have so far been proposed various scenarios of baryogenesis by considering physics beyond the msm .",
    "( see , for example , a recent review @xcite . ) among them leptogenesis  @xcite by superheavy right - handed neutrinos is one of the most motivated scenarios .",
    "this is because these new particles allow us to give non - zero masses to neutrinos which have been confirmed in many oscillation experiments .",
    "being singlet under the msm gauge group they can obtain majorana masses which are completely independent on the electroweak scale .",
    "right - handed neutrinos having superheavy masses then can generate the lepton asymmetry by their decays which can be a source of the bau .",
    "in addition , the observed smallness of active neutrino masses is naturally explained by such fermions through the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the required masses are so heavy that it is impossible to directly test these new particles in near future experiments .",
    "akhmedov , rubakov and smirnov have proposed  @xcite another attractive scenario of baryogenesis by using right - handed neutrinos ( mechanism via neutrino oscillation ) .",
    "one of the most important features is that the mechanism works when their masses are smaller than the electroweak scale , which are within the reach of current experiments .",
    "the flavor oscillation among right - handed neutrinos in the early universe leads to the separation of the lepton number into right - handed neutrinos and left - handed leptons .",
    "the sphaleron process then converts the asymmetry of the left - handed leptons into the baryon asymmetry for high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can be realized in a simple and attractive framework called as the neutrino msm ( @xmath0msm )  @xcite in which three right - handed neutrinos are introduced with majorana masses below the electroweak scale . because of the very suppressed neutrino yukawa interaction the seesaw mechanism is still effective , which leads to three active neutrinos @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and three sterile neutrinos @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) as mass eigenstates .",
    "the former ones are responsible to the neutrino oscillations observed in experiments .",
    "the latter ones give the solutions to the cosmological problems .",
    "the lightest sterile neutrino @xmath14 with mass @xmath15 kev can be a candidate of dark matter , while the rest two @xmath16 and @xmath17 with masses @xmath18 gev can generate the bau through the mechanism above .",
    "( for a review see ref .",
    "furthermore , the non - minimal coupling of higgs field to gravity allows to realize the cosmic inflation  @xcite .",
    "various aspects of baryogenesis in the @xmath0msm has been studied until now  @xcite .",
    "the generation of the asymmetry is described by the matrix of densities  @xcite of sterile ( right - handed ) neutrinos and active ( left - handed ) leptons .",
    "the previous works were based on the kinetic equations for the matrix of densities in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the terms describing the transfer of asymmetries between sterile neutrinos and active leptons are added to the original ones in @xcite . as shown in @xcite , such terms are essential to generate enough amount of the bau in the @xmath0msm . in spite of their significance",
    "such terms are introduced by a heuristic approach .",
    "the main motivation of this article is to improve the estimation of the bau in the @xmath0msm .",
    "one of the most unsatisfactory points in the previous works is that the evolution of the matrix of densities has been traced only by an approximate way .",
    "namely , the kinetic equations analyzed previously are for the typical , single mode with momentum @xmath19 ( @xmath2 is the temperature of the universe ) , which is expected to give a dominant contribution to the asymmetry . by extrapolating the result of such a mode to other modes the asymmetry in the number density",
    "is estimated .    in this article ,",
    "thus , we derive the kinetic equations in which the momentum dependence of the matrix of densities is fully taken into account . for this purpose we shall re - evaluate the destruction and production rates of sterile neutrinos as well as active leptons paying attention to the two points .",
    "one is the momentum dependence of the particle of interest .",
    "the other is the corrections coming from the fact that the states in the destruction and production processes may differ from the thermal equilibrium states ( _ i.e. _ , the deviations from the thermal equilibrium for sterile neutrinos and the chemical potentials for active leptons ) . as we will show later , the kinetic equations are written as simultaneous integrodifferential equations for the matrices of densities of sterile neutrinos and active leptons .    interestingly ,",
    "our kinetic equations include the terms connecting between sterile and active sectors , which is crucial for the baryogenesis in the @xmath0msm as mentioned before .",
    "it will be shown that such terms arise automatically as the corrections to the destruction and production rates owing to the deviations from the equilibrium states in the scattering processes .",
    "it turns out that the coefficients of these terms are different from  @xcite and , in addition , there appears a new type of terms which couples sterile neutrinos to active anti - leptons ( rather than active leptons ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : bginnumsm ] we briefly review the framework of the analysis and the baryogenesis scenario in the @xmath0msm . in the sec .",
    "[ sec : ke ] , we derive the kinetic equations which describe the generation of the baryon asymmetry paying attention to the momentum dependence in the matrices of densities . sec .",
    "[ sec : ns ] is devoted to study the numerical solutions to the obtained equations .",
    "we show the mode by mode evolution of the matrices of densities and their momentum distributions .",
    "the comparison with the previous works is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] .",
    "we perform the quantitative comparison of the yields of the bau , but also clarify the differences between the kinetic equations in the literature .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "at the beginning we review the @xmath0msm , which is the msm extended by three right - handed neutrinos @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) with lagrangian @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the msm lagrangian , @xmath24 are neutrino yukawa coupling constants , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are higgs and lepton weak - doublets , respectively .",
    "the majorana masses of right - handed neutrinos are denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking neutrinos also obtain the dirac masses , @xmath29_\\alpha{}_i = f_\\alpha{}_i { { \\langle \\phi \\rangle}}$ ] ( @xmath30 is a vacuum expectation value of the higgs field ) , and tiny neutrino masses can be explained by the seesaw mechanism if @xmath31_\\alpha{}_i \\right| \\ll m_i$ ] is satisfied . in this case ,",
    "mass eigenstates of neutrinos are consist of active neutrinos @xmath10 ( @xmath32 ) and sterile neutrinos @xmath12 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "active neutrinos are the mass eigenstates of ordinary neutrinos and sterile neutrinos are almost the right - handed states @xmath33 with masses given by the majorana masses @xmath28 approximately .    on the other hand , when we discuss baryogenesis , the temperatures of interest is higher than the electroweak scale , and we can neglect all the masses of the msm particles and also the mixing between active and sterile neutrinos . in this case",
    "we can treat active and sterile leptons as left - handed leptons and right - handed neutrinos , respectively .    among three sterile neutrinos , the lightest",
    "one @xmath14 is a candidate of dark matter . in this dark matter scenario ,",
    "the coupling constants of neutrino yukawa interaction of @xmath14 are required to be very small .",
    "( see , for example , a review  @xcite . ) as a result , @xmath14 gives the negligible contributions to the seesaw mass matrix of active neutrinos as well as the bau , and then two sterile neutrinos @xmath16 and @xmath17 are responsible to these two phenomena .    in the @xmath0msm the sufficient amount of baryon asymmetry can be generated  @xcite by the mechanism via neutrino oscillation  @xcite .",
    "the flavor oscillation between sterile ( right - handed ) neutrinos @xmath16 and @xmath17 are induced by the medium effect , which can generate the asymmetries in leptons together with the cp violation in neutrino yukawa matrix .",
    "the asymmetry in active ( left - handed ) leptons is then transformed into the baryon asymmetry due to the @xmath34 breaking sphaleron process for high temperatures @xmath35 gev  @xcite .",
    "notice that sterile neutrinos is possible to be out of thermal equilibrium due to the smallness of neutrino yukawa coupling constants .",
    "if this is the case , all the conditions for successful baryogenesis  @xcite can be satisfied .    in order to describe a series of the processes generating asymmetries",
    ", we have to deal with the coherent evolution of sterile neutrinos with the flavor oscillation , and also the incoherent scattering processes with surrounding medium for the destruction and production of sterile neutrinos .",
    "we then use the formulation with the matrix of densities  @xcite .",
    "the matrix of interest here is one in the flavor space consisting of sterile neutrinos @xmath16 and @xmath17 with positive helicities , @xmath36 and @xmath37 with negative helicities , active leptons @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and their anti - particles @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which leads to a @xmath44 matrix .",
    "the diagonal elements of this matrix are nothing but the usual occupation numbers , and the off - diagonal elements contain correlations of the flavor mixings .",
    "in the situation under consideration , however , it can be simplified as described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "first of all , the conservation of the total lepton number holds for the temperatures of baryogenesis ( @xmath45 ) , since majorana masses @xmath28 for sterile neutrinos are sufficiently small in the @xmath0msm .",
    "we can thus neglect all the elements which break the lepton number .",
    "second , active leptons possess gauge interactions and yukawa interactions with right - handed charged leptons in addition to neutrino yukawa interactions , which induce large energy gaps between active and sterile states through the thermal effect .",
    "then , the transitions between active and sterile leptons are highly suppressed , and the elements corresponding to the mixing between @xmath26 and @xmath12 ( and also @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) are neglected . at this stage ,",
    "the matrix of densities in the system is decomposed into two @xmath48 matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and two @xmath53 matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 for active leptons @xmath56 and @xmath57 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath54 is considered to be @xmath58 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sum of two contributions of lepton doublet .",
    "finally , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be neglected for the temperatures of interest .",
    "this is because the flavor transitions among active leptons are also suppressed due to the medium effects induced by the yukawa interactions of charged leptons with hierarchical coupling constants .",
    "note that active leptons can maintain the kinetic equilibrium due to the rapid interactions with medium , and hence their diagonal matrices of densities can be expressed by using the dimensionless chemical potentials @xmath59 ( the ordinary chemical potential divided by temperature ) as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an su(2 ) factor , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the equilibrium distribution function . throughout this analysis",
    "we apply the approximation of the boltzmann statistics in which @xmath64 .",
    "the evolution of the system is now described by two @xmath48 matrices of densities @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and three differences of the distribution functions @xmath67_{\\alpha \\alpha}$ ] ( or three chemical potentials @xmath68 ) .",
    "the previous works on baryogenesis via neutrino oscillations have been based on the kinetic equations for these variables given in ref .",
    "@xcite or @xcite .",
    "the original work  @xcite has considered the kinetic equations for @xmath49 and @xmath50 without including the effects from active leptons . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , their equations give too small baryon asymmetry to account for the observed value in the @xmath0msm .",
    "this is because the lightest sterile neutrino @xmath14 is a dark matter candidate and essentially only two sterile neutrinos @xmath16 and @xmath17 participate in baryogenesis .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite has introduced the terms which connect active and sterile sectors , and solved the kinetic equations for both @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it has been shown that the additional terms boost the generation of the asymmetry and hence are vital for the successful baryogenesis in the @xmath0msm .",
    "there are , however , various aspects to be improved in the previous works towards the precise prediction of the baryon asymmetry in the @xmath0msm .",
    "one of the most important points is to include correctly the momentum dependence in the matrices of densities @xmath65 and @xmath71 .",
    "so far , it has been analyzed only the evolution of the single mode with a typical momentum @xmath72 , and estimated the asymmetries in number densities by the approximation that the occupation numbers are proportional to the equilibrium one @xmath73 .",
    "to get rid of this uncertainty , therefore , we will write down the kinetic equations of the matrices of densities for all the modes and solve them numerically taking care of the expansion of the universe . it will be shown later that the momentum distributions of @xmath69 are distorted significantly from @xmath74 .",
    "now we are at the position to derive the kinetic equations for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "first of all , let us consider the time evolution of @xmath49 .",
    "our construction is based on ref .",

    "from now on we shall apply the approximation of the boltzmann statistics and replace the third term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhon ] ) as @xmath84 .        the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhon ] ) describes the coherent evolution of @xmath49 and the oscillation of sterile neutrinos occurs due to the off - diagonal elements of @xmath81 , which is essential for baryogenesis under consideration .",
    "it is found from the self energy for sterile neutrinos at finite temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig : self ] that the effective potential for the mode @xmath85 is given by  @xcite @xmath86_{ij }    = \\frac{n_d t^2}{16 \\ , k_n } \\,\\big [ f^\\dagger f \\big]_{ij }     \\ , , \\ ] ] where we disregard the correction to @xmath81 from the asymmetries in active leptons .    in the estimation of @xmath81 ( as well as @xmath87 below )",
    "all masses including @xmath28 are neglected since they are irrelevant for temperatures of interest .",
    "( note , however , that we keep @xmath28 in @xmath88 because they are crucial for the oscillation of sterile neutrinos . )",
    "further , we first calculate them in the basis where neutrino yukawa matrix is diagonal , and then find the expression in the original basis shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_numsm ] ) .               here are some comments .",
    "first , we have fully taken into account the momentum dependence in the matrices of densities @xmath49 and @xmath50 . as a result ,",
    "the kinetic equations are written as simultaneous integrodifferential equations , which allow us to find the distribution of the occupation numbers of sterile neutrinos , the significant modes to generate the baryon asymmetry , and the temperatures crucial for baryogenesis .",
    "second , we have calculated the destruction and production rates of sterile neutrinos and active leptons for a given momentum . it should be noted that we have taken into account the case when the initial and final states in scattering processes which are not in the thermal equilibrium and estimate the corrections to the rates from the deviations @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "interestingly , the communication terms between @xmath49 and @xmath54 ( @xmath50 and @xmath55 ) introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite arise automatically , which is the term with @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ke1 ] ) .",
    "now we can understand well the origin of such terms .",
    "for instance , @xmath104 originates in the correction to the production rate of @xmath126 in the scattering processes ( a ) and ( b ) when chemical potentials of active leptons are non - zero .",
    "the similar discussion can be applied to the communication terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ke3 ] ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , they play a crucial role to generate the bau in the @xmath0msm .",
    "finally , our kinetic equations also contain the communication terms between @xmath49 and @xmath55 ( @xmath50 and @xmath127 ) which have not been discussed before .",
    "for example , the term with @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ke1 ] ) corresponds to it .",
    "such a term arises as the corrections to the destruction rates of sterile neutrinos due to the non - zero chemical potentials of active leptons via the scattering process ( c ) .",
    "the important point is that the term with @xmath128 is the second order of the matrices of densities ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath129 ) and the kinetic equations are no longer linear in @xmath130 and @xmath68 .",
    "further , the presence of these terms is essential to ensure the conservation of the lepton number .",
    "the total lepton number becomes a conserved charge for temperatures of baryogenesis since the majorana masses are much smaller than @xmath131 , as mentioned before . in the considering system",

    ". it is found for the scattering processes ( a ) and ( b ) that the production ( or destruction ) terms in @xmath49 and @xmath50 cancel with the destruction ( or production ) terms in @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , after taking the trace and integrating over momentum .",
    "as for the process ( c ) the production ( or destruction ) terms in @xmath49 and @xmath50 cancel with the production ( or destruction ) terms in @xmath55 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "thus , if the system starts with the lepton symmetric universe , the asymmetry of sterile neutrinos is always opposite to that of active leptons .",
    "namely , the kinetic equations here describe not the generation of the total lepton asymmetry ( _ i.e. _ , _ leptogenesis _ ) , but the separation into sterile and active sectors .",
    "in this section , we shall study the numerical solution of the kinetic equations ( [ eq : ke1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ke3 ] ) . to incorporate the expansion of the universe",
    "we replace the time derivative in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ke1 ] ) as @xmath137 , where @xmath138 ( @xmath139 gev ) is the hubble expansion rate .",
    "the time - temperature relation is then given by @xmath140 .",

    "the inclusion of the momentum dependence enhances the bau by about 40% and 10% for @xmath264 mev and 10 gev , respectively .",
    "this is because the enhancement in the generation of the asymmetry from the lower modes overcomes the suppression induced by the higher modes . on the other hand ,",
    "such an amplification may be disturbed by the wash - out effect for large neutrino yukawa coupling constants .",

    "<S> we investigate baryogenesis in the @xmath0msm ( neutrino minimal standard model ) , which is the msm extended by three right - handed neutrinos with masses below the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated by the mechanism via flavor oscillation of right - handed ( sterile ) neutrinos which are responsible to masses of active neutrinos confirmed by various experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we present the kinetic equations for the matrix of densities of leptons which describe the generation of asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the momentum dependence of the matrix of densities is taken into account . by solving these equations numerically </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the momentum distribution is significantly distorted from the equilibrium one , since the production for the modes with lower momenta @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the temperature of the universe ) is enhanced , while suppressed for higher modes . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the most important mode for the yields of sterile neutrinos as well as the baryon asymmetry is @xmath3 , which is smaller than @xmath4 inferred from the thermal average . </S>",
