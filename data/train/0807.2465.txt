    ", we define a flexible framework with resonances and more generic interactions than have previously been considered . at the same time",
    ", we strive to limit the number of parameters in this lagrangian , to make the parameter space manageable . dialing the parameters then allows to describe a sampling of strong interaction models , as msugra did for the mssm : our framework is intended to work in a similar way , applied to dewsb .",
    "we have already presented some phenomenological applications in @xcite ; the present paper details the inner workings of our framework .    in practice",
    ", our approach extends attempts to model strong interactions , based on the ideas of hidden local symmetry and mooses @xcite as well as 5d warped models @xcite ( themselves inspired by ads / cft @xcite ) .",
    "these approaches have been used for qcd @xcite with some accuracy , and thus tend to describe strong interactions which closely follow qcd behavior up to a rescaling of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , they all predict the following : 1 ) the spectrum consists of an alternance of states with definite parity , implying that only half of the neutral resonances couple to @xmath2 scattering , 2 ) the lightest resonance has vector parity , and 3 ) the photon couplings to two different particles vanish ( the equivalent of @xmath3 vanishing in qcd ) .    to explore different scenarios ,",
    "we will build on a previous construction holographic technicolor ( htc ) @xcite in which the new strong interactions can differ from rescaled qcd .",
    "in addition to their allowing new phenomena , deviations from qcd may help alleviate difficulties with electroweak precision tests ( ewpts ) @xcite .",
    "htc uses 5d language but , compared to higgsless models @xcite , it adds deviations from pure ads 5d geometry in the form of effective warp factors which differ for the various fields .",
    "as the name _ effective warp factors _ implies , we are only borrowing 5d language to describe a 4d scenario .",
    "therefore , it does not matter that simple 5d models do not reproduce these effective warp factors by using bulk scalars @xcite .",
    "indeed , the same physics could be obtained in a purely 4d context by using moose notation @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use the htc language to model the resonances and sm gauge boson sectors .",

    "we _ define _ the interactions of the fermions by setting their couplings to the @xmath28 mass eigenstates by hand to obey the sm relations .",
    "usually , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are defined from two - point functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , or from operators in an effective lagrangian like @xmath33 . here",
    "we follow a different procedure by working directly in the mass basis where there are no mixing operators which would contribute to the @xmath29 and @xmath30 parameters . moreover , by imposing sm couplings between fermions and @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath34 ,",
    "we ensure that the amplitudes extracted experimentally satisfy @xmath35 .",
    "this can be read off from the expression for the neutral current amplitude @xcite @xmath36    our phenomenological study is not intended to present a uv completion that would resolve the clashes between dewsb and oblique corrections .",
    "rather , it tries to present the possible phenomenological consequences of a scenario that would pass the oblique and tgc constraints ( section [ sec_tgcs ] ) .",
    "we set the couplings of fermions to the resonances to be compatible with experimental bounds from lep and tevatron @xcite .",
    "to keep the study manageable in the spin-1 sector , we use 5d techniques , trading the plethora of resonance couplings in ( [ cubics ] ) for a few extra - dimensional parameters .",
    "the usual reason for using 5d models to describe 4d strongly interacting theories is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "although rigorous derivations of this duality have only been obtained for very specific cases , we do not need an exact equivalence in order to study lhc phenomenology .",
    "indeed , provided the essential properties of the 5d model are the same as the strong interaction scenario , we can use the 5d description as a physical guide and organizing scheme .",
    "the 5d description also allows for the introduction of deviations from rescaled qcd , using for instance holographic technicolor ( section [ sec_htc ] ) .",
    "we quickly review the extra - dimensional properties and language we need .",

    "this fourier decomposition is called in this context _ kaluza - klein _ ( kk ) decomposition , and the infinite tower of kk excitations , the kk - tower .",
    "the wavefunctions @xmath45 are obtained by solving the equation of motion of the field @xmath47 in the background given by @xmath37 .",
    "the wavefunctions also depend on the boundary conditions ( bcs ) imposed at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "if the bcs do not allow massless ( i.e. flat ) modes in the spectrum , then there is no remaining 4d gauge invariance .",
    "once the wavefunctions are known , the interactions between 4d fields can be derived from overlap integrals .",
    "for example , the coupling of the @xmath32 and @xmath31 bosons to a resonance @xmath48 is the integral of their wavefunctions along the @xmath39-coordinate , @xmath49 such couplings can be computed easily , yielding from the lagrangian ( [ linit ] ) the value of all the cubic couplings of sm gauge fields ( [ tgvs ] ) and resonances ( [ cubics ] ) .    for a given choice of gauge group , bcs and geometry , a 5d model uses only a few pararmeters to describe a complex scenario of many particles . in the simplest version ( ads ) , these parameters are : the length @xmath41 , the dimensionless gauge coupling @xmath50 and the form of the geometry @xmath51 . in the following we introduce _ two _ more parameters in the functional shape of the warp factors .",

    "the above combination of bcs ensures that the only surviving symmetry at low energies is @xmath66 .",

    "in which there is only one warp factor with a fixed expression @xmath73 , exhibit features similar to a rescaled version of qcd ( alternating spectrum with selection rules for couplings ) . allowing two different warp factors which deviate from ads in the infrared , as in htc ( [ linit ] ) , lifts these restrictions .    for computations ,",
    "we need to pick an explicit expression form for the warp factors : we choose the positive - definite @xmath74 we use the name _ effective warp factors _ because @xmath75 do not correspond to an actual geometry in 5d @xcite .",
    "rather , @xmath75 parameterize different scenarios of technivectors : varying @xmath76 amounts to changing the masses and couplings of the vector and axial resonances .",
    "the exact power of @xmath39 in ( [ wav ] ) is not crucial : a modification of the power could be partly absorbed in a modification of @xmath77 . what matters is that the effective metrics deviate from ads in the ir , and thus modify the wave - functions and overlap integrals ( [ tri0 ] ) from which the couplings are obtained .    beyond the breaking by ir bcs , familiar from higgsless theories @xcite ) , the different effective metrics felt by the @xmath78 and @xmath79 fields introduce symmetry breaking in the bulk ( @xmath39-dependence ) .",
    "brane - breaking corresponds to the choice of bcs in ( [ bcsir ] ) , while bulk - breaking is introduced on top of ( [ bcsir ] ) as different effective metrics in ( [ linit ] ) @xmath80 in the case of brane - breaking , the only distinction between the broken ( axial ) and unbroken ( vector ) generators comes from the ir bcs . in a `` dual '' interpretation , where the fifth space coordinate is inversely related with an energy scale",
    ", this corresponds to the symmetry breaking occuring suddenly at the resonance scale @xcite .",
    "the localization of the breaking at a point in the extra - dimension suppresses effects at any scale above that .",
    "such hard - wall breaking is the crudest 5d model of spontaneous symmetry breaking .    if the symmetry breaking is turned on progressively along the 5th dimension rather than at the ir brane alone , we have bulk breaking .",
    "the strength of the breaking , and therefore the difference between the properties of vector and axial states , is governed by the @xmath39-dependence of the breaking term .",
    "the standard way to accomplish bulk breaking is to add a scalar bulk field , and to let it obtain a vacuum expectation value .",
    "however , the kk decomposition of the bulk scalar would introduce 4d scalar resonances , which we want to avoid for simplicity in the present paper .",
    "rather , in the htc lagrangian ( [ linit ] ) , we introduced a position dependent kinetic term mixing @xmath81 and @xmath82 gauge fields , which is invariant under the vector gauge symmetry and parity .",
    "obviously , many more terms besides @xmath72 could be added to the lagrangian and may lead to different phenomenology , but @xmath72 is the operator with lowest dimension and number of derivatives and no new fields .    from the effective field theory point of view , what matters is that bulk - breaking allows a more general spectrum and structure for the cubic interactions of ( [ cubics ] ) ,",

    ", this effect comes from the uv bcs which mix the vector and axial sectors ( [ bcsuv ] ) .",

    "when the two effective warp factors are equal , the tgcs ( [ tgvs ] ) satisfy @xmath139 more generally , equality of the two effective warp factors implies that , for any three spin-1 particles @xmath140 the three couplings @xmath141 are equal , according to @xmath142 where we have already used @xmath143 . applied to photon couplings , this implies that the photon can not mediate a transition between two different particles .",
    "deviating from a standard 5d ads set - up allows for a richer structure . in htc , plugging in @xmath144 for the vector ( axial ) component profile of field @xmath145 , we find @xmath146 where @xmath147c are charged fields , and @xmath148 is neutral . in the most general scenario , where the vector and axial warp factors are different and @xmath149 , the couplings of the three permutations can all be different @xmath150 when @xmath122 and @xmath151 are antiparticles of each other , @xmath122 and @xmath151 share the same profile , so the two couplings with the derivative acting on a charged field are equal @xmath152 when the neutral field is the photon , there is an additional constraint on the triboson couplings from @xmath153 gauge invariance @xmath154 this result derives from the @xmath34 wavefunction being flat : the cubic overlap integrals ( [ triboson1]-[triboson2 ] ) then reduce to a quadratic overlap corresponding to the orthogonality relations @xmath155 on the other hand , the third photon coupling ( i.e. ( [ triboson ] ) with @xmath156 ) does not reduce to such an orthogonality relation : it would be written as ( [ ortho ] ) , but with the warp factors swapped @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , couplings such as @xmath158 vanish in higgsless models , but not in htc .",
    "the new coupling is shown in figure [ fig_vertical - couplings ] along the usual lines .",
    "we see two effects at play : first , unequal warp factors @xmath138 allow for a coupling of the axial resonance to @xmath159 , and second , the mixing also allows a coupling of the vector resonance to @xmath159 . hence both resonances can decay to @xmath159 , as studied in @xcite .",
    "we take a pragmatic approach to the description of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking , providing a resonance lagrangian simple enough to be implemented in monte - carlo simulations , yet complex enough to incorporate phenomena beyond those usually considered .",
    "our description of new strong interactions does not rely on an explicit model , but rather introduces phenomenological parameters describing the interactions of new states visible at the lhc .",
    "such an effective description usually comes at a price , namely the large number of unknown parameters to be varied .",
    "we deal with this problem by imposing relations between the constants appearing in the effective lagrangian : we construct our effective lagrangian using rules from extra - dimensional model - building in order to impose constraints ( we could equally well have retained a fully 4d formulation by relying on mooses ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we also want to lift some of the 5d constraints that seem too restrictive . to avoid the alternating spectrum and selection rules usually predicted by the usual 5d or moose approach , we work with an extension of the 5d framework : holographic technicolor ( htc ) , which starts as a 5d model , but adds as a new ingredient an effective bulk - breaking term without introducing new states other than spin-1 resonances .",
    "we do not try to reproduce specific models in the literature , but instead study the phenomenology of new scenarios that evade some of the usual constraints on technicolor models .",
    "the uv completions of such scenarios are unknown , but we assume in our effective description that the problem of oblique corrections is solved , and set the couplings of fermions to @xmath28 accordingly .",
    "we also choose the couplings of sm fermions to resonances to pass experimental bounds .",
    "we rely on bounds from the trilinear gauge couplings to restrict our three free parameters , and find that low - mass resonances ( @xmath160 ) are allowed .",
    "working in this low - mass assumption , we consider two interesting curves in the remaining two - parameter space .",
    "two new couplings that our lagrangian generally includes turn out to be relevant in these regions , allowing both light resonances to be seen in the @xmath161 channel ( as well as in the @xmath2 channel ) , and to decay to @xmath159 ( observable at lhc ) .",
    "regarding future developments , we point out that our choice of effective description ( drawing on the 5d formalism ) allows for an easy inclusion of additional fields , such as scalars , technipions or the isospin - singlet techni - omega .",

    "in this appendix , we detail a subtlety in the derivation of tgcs in our framework as compared to other approaches .      the electroweak chiral lagrangian @xcite describes the electroweak sector without higgs at low energies .",
    "it is constructed by coupling the yang - mills action of @xmath162 @xmath163 to a chiral lagrangian for the three goldstone bosons ( gbs ) of the breaking @xmath164 this is the minimal custodial sector that feeds 3 gbs without introducing technipions .",

    "the @xmath113 term introduces the mixing of @xmath184 and @xmath185 , even though the quadratic lagrangian may have been diagonalized at the previous order ; @xmath113 is thus an oblique correction .",
    "one may choose to diagonalize the full quadratic lagrangian at this order ( i.e. including @xmath113 ) in order to work in the mass basis , thereby shifting the deviation from the sm into fermion couplings @xcite .",
    "the cubic terms in @xmath113 as well as @xmath174 in the lagrangian ( [ op4 ] ) produce deviations from the sm in the tgcs ( [ tgvs ] ) , given by @xcite ( assuming @xmath178 ) @xmath187 this derivation uses the standard relation @xmath188 which is valid for the electroweak chiral lagrangian , but not true in general .",
    "indeed , relation ( [ gff ] ) assumes that @xmath189 appearing in the covariant derivative ( [ dmuu ] ) is strictly equal to the fermion-@xmath31 coupling , something which does not hold in our framework , nor in standard 5d models @xcite .",
    "we chose to _ define _ the interactions of the fermions by assigning them couplings to the physical mass eigenstates that satisfy the sm relations .",
    "therefore , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 parameters will vanish . on the other hand , we model the interactions of spin-1 fields , imposing experimental values for the parameters @xmath190 , and predicting the tgcs . as a consequence ,",
    "relations between fermion couplings ( which are set by hand ) and quantities involving @xmath34 , @xmath28 ( which are predicted from a 5d lagrangian ) are modified .",
    "for example @xmath191 does not hold at tree level if @xmath189 means the fermion-@xmath31 coupling this coupling is set by hand outside any 5d modelling , whereas @xmath70 and @xmath192 are an output of the 5d model .",
    "in other words , we have in general @xmath193    as a consequence , we find that , while relation ( [ kappagamma ] ) holds in our framework , the same is not true of ( [ g1z]-[kappaz ] ) .",
