    "[ fig1 ] caption .",
    "now we assume that at some point @xmath30 along the propagation line locates a scatterer which flips the amplitudes of the modes .",
    "this can be achieved , for instance , by antisymmetric gaussian perturbation of the refraction index shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . by choosing the size @xmath31 of the refraction index perturbation @xmath32 the perturbation matrix elements@xmath33",
    "can be set in such a way that the mode scattering matrix@xmath34 with the scattering action matrix @xcite@xmath35 is proportional to the pauli matrix @xmath36 with a coefficient@xmath37 for a smooth enough perturbation @xmath38 , the back scattering is negligible .",
    "the assumption @xmath39 is not crucial and as we show in section  [ sii ] one can even use this angle as an additional free parameter in the problem .",
    "we also note here that frequency dependence mode - couplers , as fiber gratings @xcite , can fit to this general model of scatterers .",
    "we now come to the key idea of our method .",
    "the combined mode transformation matrix that describes scattering and then propagation for distance @xmath21 , reads @xmath40 we repeat such a transformation @xmath41 times with @xmath41 different length parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and require that up to the common phase factor @xmath45 the resulting transformation matrix @xmath46 equals to a nondegenerate square root of the identity matrix @xcite with the accuracy of the order of @xmath47 .",
    "formally this requirement implies that @xmath48 while the linear coefficient @xmath49 in the characteristic polynomial @xmath50   = \\lambda^{2}+c_{1}\\left (   l_{1},l_{2},l_{3},\\omega\\right )   \\lambda-1 \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] vanishes together with its two first frequency derivatives , that is @xmath51 in such a situation the @xmath52 becomes the identity matrix up to a cubic correction@xmath53   } , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is a @xmath55 matrix of norm one .",
    "therefore both waveguide modes have identical phase shifts @xmath56 , which does not contain quadratic terms in their taylor expansion over frequency thus resulting in the signal propagation with identical group velocity in both modes and with no quadratic dispersion .",
    "furthermore , in practice the @xmath48 requirement does not need to be imposed since @xmath57 always holds for unitary matrices . in this case",
    ", an additional frequency - independent global phase will appear on @xmath52  that we will ignore in the rest of the discussion for two modes @xmath58this phase can be easily recompensed .",
    "now we let us turn to our particular example where we have an explicit analytic expression for the coefficient @xmath59 @xmath60 \\label{eq12}\\\\ &   \\{\\cos\\left [   f_{z}\\left (   \\omega\\right )   \\left (   l_{1}-l_{2}-l_{3}\\right ) \\right ]   + \\nonumber\\\\ &   \\cos\\left [   f_{z}\\left (   \\omega\\right )   \\left (   l_{1}+l_{2}-l_{3}\\right ) \\right ]   + \\nonumber\\\\ &   \\cos\\left [   f_{z}\\left (   \\omega\\right )   \\left (   l_{1}-l_{2}+l_{3}\\right ) \\right ]   \\}\\nonumber\\\\ &   -2\\cos^{3}f_{x}\\left (   \\omega\\right )   \\cos\\left [   f_{z}\\left ( \\omega\\right )   \\left (   l_{1}+l_{2}+l_{3}\\right )   \\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while according to eq.([eq3a ] ) @xmath61 @xmath62 , and therefore , to be consistent within the order of approximation , the term containing @xmath63 has to be ignored .",

    "the system eq.([eq13 ] ) has a continuous family of solutions easy to find numerically .",
    "one can get a countable number of solutions if the system is complemented by the additional physical requirement @xmath68 . then , for @xmath69 , and coefficients @xmath70 , @xmath71 suggested by the taylor expansions around the frequency @xmath72 , we numerically find one of many possible solutions , @xmath73 @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "this solution indeed yields the transfer matrix @xmath77 over a period of length @xmath78 , where @xmath79 a cubic correction .",
    "we note here that the degeneracy in the system eq.([eq10 ] ) is lifted when either the requirement @xmath39 or the assumption eq.([eq6 ] ) is relaxed .    to better ensure the identity of propagating signals in different modes , the order @xmath0 of the taylor remainder can be increased and , in principle , done as high as needed, the system eq.([eq10 ] ) for such a case has to be extended to incorporate more variables @xmath80 and require vanishing of all higher - order derivatives @xmath81 at @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast , in order to eliminate also the cubic and higher - order dispersion in the common phase of the modes , one has to properly tailor the frequency dependence of the refraction index @xmath17 , a task which can be possibly addressed in the discipline of metamaterials . in the case where no explicit analytical derivatives of the mode dispersion are available all the derivatives entering eqs.([eq10 ] ) have to be taken numerically .",
    "we now briefly consider the general formulation of the problem in the case of @xmath4 modes with different dispersion laws @xmath83 .",
    "the aim is to achieve a tailored breaking of translational symmetry such as all modes have identical dispersion laws up to the @xmath0-th order of tailor expansion .",
    "as earlier , we consider a sequence of mode scattering transformations@xmath84 where @xmath85 is a generic @xcite frequency dependent @xmath86 hermitian scattering action matrix , and @xmath87 is a real traceless diagonal @xmath86 matrix with the elements @xmath88 , which describes the mode phase difference accumulation per unit waveguide distance .",
    "the average mode wavevector @xmath89  contributes with a global phase @xmath90 , which is factored out from the product eq.([eq15 ] ) .",
    "let us assume that by tuning the material refraction index one gets the desired analytic properties @xmath91 at @xmath82 .",
    "one thus have to find length intervals @xmath92 such that @xmath93 would be a nondegenerate @xmath4-th root of the identity matrix up to the terms @xmath94 .",
    "to this end we consider the characteristic polynomial@xmath50   = \\lambda^{n}+\\sum_{n=1}^{n-1}c_{n}\\left (   \\left\\ {   l_{l}\\right\\ }   , \\omega\\right ) \\lambda^{n}+e^{i\\varphi\\left (   \\left\\ {   l_{l}\\right\\ }   , \\omega\\right )   } \\label{eq16}\\ ] ] and require , that at @xmath82 all coefficients @xmath95 vanish together with all their derivatives till @xmath96-th order .",
    "in addition , we require that @xmath97  with @xmath98 an integer number , and also all derivatives to vanish including @xmath96-th order . all together",
    "we impose @xmath99 conditions on @xmath99 variables @xmath100 ,  a system of nonlinear algebraic equations to be solved numerically for given @xmath87 and @xmath85 . once a solution is found , the repetition of the scattering sequence @xmath4-times , corresponding to the matrix @xmath101   } $ ] results in the required propagation with a common phase @xmath90 , which can be in principle controlled by a proper tailoring of the refraction index @xmath7 .",
    "in the aforementioned analysis , we have presented the method by considering , as a model example , the spatial modes of a waveguide . in this context , it is difficult to think of structures conforming the strict conditions of perfect scattering ( [ eq5])-([eq6 ] ) , even though the possibility of tailoring the dispersion relations of the waveguide is realistic . in this section ,",
    "we provide a second example of applicability of the method , addressing different issues that may arise in practice and considering realistic structures in the mode conversion of the input signal .    to simplify the approach , we consider propagation into unbounded media ( instead of a waveguide ) ;",
    "thus , the role of two modes is played by the two polarizations of the incoming field which are vertical to each other .",
    "the background medium treats differently each direction of electric field which means that is uniaxial @xcite , namely is characterized by a diagonal permittivity matrix .",
    "furthermore , since we are referring to real - world systems , the scattering angles ( which now express linear polarization tilts ) are considered small to avoid significant back - scattering .",
    "it has been found @xcite , that a magnetically - biased graphene flake exhibits that property of polarization rotation and therefore it is utilized in our consideration .",
    "for the operational frequencies that this effect is recorded , the tilt is not changing substantially and thus is assumed to be frequency - independent . under these assumptions and",
    "as we show below , the first equation of eqs.([eq10 ] ) dictates that the sum of all the scattering angles of the half - scheme ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) should be equal to @xmath102 .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] . as the light arrives from the left side , it propagates into our background medium for a total length @xmath106 before meeting a graphene sheet of scattering angle @xmath107 .",
    "to this end , it is inserted to a stack of @xmath4 identical graphene flakes with distance @xmath108 between two neighboring ones ; the graphenes are suitably polarized and doped to achieve an overall faraday rotation of @xmath102 .",
    "the outcoming signal propagates for another length @xmath106 before being subjected to an opposite tilt of @xmath109 .",
    "as indicated above , to avoid transmissivity issues , the polarization tilt @xmath107 is taken low and for simplicity equal to that of each graphene sheet of the stack : @xmath110 . the same half - structure repeats itself to form a planar stack of multiple layers which provides dispersion - free propagation .",
    "of the uniaxial medium as function of frequency @xmath111.,width=215 ]      an electric field @xmath112 with a vector lying on the @xmath113 plane which propagates along the @xmath9 axis into a uniaxial medium , characterized by refractive indexes @xmath114 along the corresponding axes , is written as an inverse fourier transform : @xmath115 .",
    "the complex phasor of the electric field is given by @xcite : @xmath116 while @xmath117 is the fourier transform of the time - dependent profile of the input signal which is assumed to be concentrated around a central operating frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath118 determine the sort ( linear or elliptical ) and the tilt angle of the polarization @xcite .",
    "it is clear that each electric component sees  a different permittivity and gets affected independently by each of the refractive indexes @xmath119 due to the uniaxial nature of the background medium . for this reason ,",
    "each transverse component of the electric field defines a mode with different dispersion relation @xmath120 .",
    "we assume that the frequency - dependent refractive indexes follow simple lorentz models @xcite and are written as follows : @xmath121 assume that the two permittivities are characterized by the same plasma frequency @xmath122 for brevity , while the high - frequency limits of the dielectric constants are different ( @xmath123 for the @xmath124 direction and @xmath125 for the @xmath126 direction ) . the resonance frequencies @xmath127 are also different and , since @xmath128 , we need to assume @xmath129 for reasons that will become obvious later in the analysis .",
    "note that for a lossless medium ( which is our case because we study the propagation into it ) , the quantities @xmath130 of ( [ eq : refractiveindexx ] ) and ( [ eq : refractiveindexy ] ) are either positive or purely imaginary ; we are obviously interested for frequencies where both are positive : @xmath131 .",
    "since the polarization direction ( angle ) of our electric field expresses the weights of each of the two superimposed modes , it should be retained as linear during the free propagation into our background medium ; this is possible only into an isotropic environment .",
    "however , our material is uniaxial ; thus , we demand @xmath132 only at @xmath82 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] , we schematically show the variation of the quantities @xmath133 $ ] with respect to the frequency @xmath134 .",
    "each curve begins from the origin @xmath135 and takes all the positive values to become infinite at @xmath136 . for @xmath137",
    "the represented quantity becomes imaginary since the value under the root in ( [ eq : refractiveindexx]),([eq : refractiveindexy ] ) turns to very negative from very positive .",
    "however , if @xmath111 passes a larger threshold ( @xmath138 for the @xmath124 direction ) , the refractive index gets again positive and remains so ( no matter how high the frequency is  for @xmath139 behaves like its linear asymptote ) . as also indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , when one has @xmath128 ( as we assumed ) , the two refractive indexes can be equal only when @xmath129 and such an equality is achieved for operational frequencies within the interval @xmath140 . at the frequency @xmath141 ,",
    "the refractive index of @xmath124 axis gets nullified ; for @xmath142 its curve @xmath143 has two common points with the graph of @xmath144 at the frequencies @xmath145 and @xmath146 whose explicit expressions are not shown here for brevity .",
    "therefore , we have two alternative central frequencies @xmath147 at which the isotropy demand is well - served .",
    "nevertheless , an additional constraint is related to the sign of the second derivative of propagation constants @xmath148 .",
    "the whole dispersion - neutralization concept described in the section  [ si ] is based on the assumption that the quantities @xmath149 and @xmath150 are opposite in the vicinity of @xmath82 .",
    "accordingly , we would like the functions @xmath151 and @xmath152 to have opposite second derivatives at their common points @xmath147 . a necessary but not sufficient condition for it ,",

    "as anticipated , the transmission through the structure gets deteriorated far from @xmath82 because the device has been designed to operate at this oscillation frequency .",
    "notice that the two diagonal elements of @xmath176 have almost identical magnitude variation with respect to @xmath111 ; this feature can be attributed to the effective `` averaging '' performed by the multiple layers which mitigates the overall asymmetry .",

    "[ fig : fig4b ] , the total transmissivity is much weaker due to the presence of numerous graphene sheets ( as implied above ) .",

    "this result that seems negative at first look , may pave new methods in multi - mode quantum communication , where entanglement can be generated ` on the way ' and used for error - protection of signals against photon losses .",
    "this idea is to be further developed in a future work .",

    "<S> we show how by a tailored breaking of the translational symmetry in waveguides and optical fibers one can control chromatic dispersions of the individual modes at any order and thereby overcome the problem of coherent classical and quantum signal transmission at long distances . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on previously developed quantum control techniques and provides analytic solution for a general class of models . in practice , this requires mode couplers and the possibility of tailoring the dispersion laws around the operating frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the method for spatial modes of a waveguide and we further apply the technique to design dispersion - less propagation for the polarization modes of a uniaxial material .    </S>",
    "<S> transmission of information at long distances via multi - mode optical fibers / waveguides is limited by the necessity to compensate for the spread in package arrival times caused by the discrepancy in the group velocities of different waveguide modes . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time the dispersion effects need to be compensated for each of the modes . </S>",
    "<S> is there a way to overcome these problems and construct a multi - mode waveguide with identical group velocities of different modes and no quadratic dispersion ? </S>",
    "<S> here we show that by breaking the translation invariance in a specific way one can accomplish such a task .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a vast amount of work @xcite-@xcite related the dispersion problem and the method developed here has unavoidable overlap with several of them . </S>",
    "<S> the method that we suggest provides dispersion along the fiber / waveguide by perturbing the translation symmetry similarly to fiber bragg gratings @xcite and the tailoring of photonic band structures techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this also assumes availability of mode couplers which have been extensively used in the design of dispersion compensation filters for two @xcite and higher number of modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for the development of the method we borrow previously developed ideas  for implementing quantum control @xcite over compact semigroups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution of our method is that the discrepancy in the mode dispersion laws can be compensated _ up to any predetermined order _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 of the taylor expansion around a given operational signal frequency , in complete analogy with the regime of quantum error protection @xcite,@xcite and similar to the regime of dynamic decoupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover in the case where advanced tailoring of the dispersions laws is possible , the method can be extended to compensate for higher than quadratic order dispersions .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of this paper is the following . in section  [ si ] </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate and develop the method at a simple example of two spatial mode waveguide of a rectangular profile . </S>",
    "<S> the exact analytical expressions for the mode dispersions permit to suggest an explicit spatial distribution of ideal scatterers coupling the modes and which act as perturbations backing the translational invariance . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we derive @xmath1 non - linear algebraic equations in analytic form that determine the positions @xmath2 of @xmath3 scatterers , such that signals on the two modes propagate in phase , synchronously and without dispersion up to @xmath0-th order of taylor expansion . at the same time , we emphasize that , by analogy , the same problem can be solved for any finite number @xmath4 of modes by finding numerically a proper distribution of @xmath5  generic @xcite ideal scatterers along the perturbation period .  in section  [ sii ] </S>",
    "<S> we apply the method for designing dispersion - less propagation in an actual structure with imperfect scattering carried out by flakes of graphene in a uniaxial background . with this example </S>",
    "<S> , we explicitly show how the method can be efficiently adjusted to given realistic conditions and materials . </S>"
