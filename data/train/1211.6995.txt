    "in contrast , the shape of the rotation curve of the milky way is relatively ambiguous , although it is believed to be almost flat , i.e. , similar to those of external spiral galaxies ( e.g. , sofue et al .",
    "this uncertainty is mainly owing to difficulties in measuring the relevant distances , since we are located inside the milky way . to precisely measure the distances to and proper motions of galactic objects based on astrometry ,",

    "a kinematic distance of @xmath96 kpc was obtained ( molinari et al . 1996 ) based on the systemic local - standard - of - rest ( lsr ) velocity ( @xmath15 ) of @xmath815.5 @xmath0 1.9 km s@xmath4 traced by cs ( 2 - 1 ) emission ( bronfman et al .",

    "in fact , kinematic distances along the sun - galactic center direction can not be determined precisely , since @xmath15 is degenerate around 0 km s@xmath4 . to estimate the error in the kinematic distance at the source , we consider the error , @xmath18 1.9 km s@xmath4 for a flat rotation model .",

    "eleven vlbi observations with _ vera _ obtained between october 2009 and may 2011 yielded the trigonometric parallax and proper motion of iras 05168 + 3634 .",

    "the proper motion components are ( @xmath24cos@xmath25 , @xmath26 ) = ( 0.23 @xmath0 1.07 , @xmath83.14 @xmath0 0.28 ) mas yr@xmath4 . the resulting distance is significantly smaller than the previous kinematic distance estimate of 6 kpc ( molinari et al . 1996 ) .",
    "our result places the source in the perseus arm rather than in the outer arm ( see fig .",

    "note that a flat galactic rotation curve @xmath2(@xmath20 ) = @xmath21 was assumed to derive the peculiar motions .",
    "obviously , almost all sources in the perseus arm are moving systematically toward the galactic center ( as shown by the positive @xmath27 components ) , and lag behind the galactic rotation ( as exemplified by the negative @xmath28 components ) .",
    "based on the density - wave theory proposed by lin @xmath22 shu ( 1964 ) , the peculiar motions may have been generated at the inner edge of the perseus arm , where a shock front occurs . especially for the @xmath28 components in the perseus arm ,",
    "a strong correlation with galactocentric distance ( @xmath20 ) has been reported ( e.g. , sakai et al .",
    "2012c ) . to confirm the validity of the density - wave theory , astrometry in the third galactic quadrant for the perseus arm is crucial since the co - rotation radius ( @xmath27 = @xmath28 = 0 ) can exist in this region ( cf .",
    "melnik et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we have been observing galactic star - forming regions with _ vera _ , which will allow us to understand not only the total mass in the galactic disk ( as part of the _ vera _ outer rotation curve project ) , but also whether the density - wave theory is correct , an assessment we anticipate to make in the near future ."
