    "the most representative device of ta is acoustic cloak that guides sound waves traveling around the cloaked objects without scattering and thus make itself and the hidden objects invisible from acoustic detections  @xcite . from the standard approach of ta , acoustic cloaks in fluid are made up of anisotropic materials with tensor mass densities . though real fluids do not possess these properties , a variety of cloaks have been produced by using artificial acoustic metamaterials  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has been realized long ago that moving media act as curved spacetimes and can be used to simulate cosmic phenomena for both electromagnetic waves  @xcite and sound waves  @xcite . in the pioneering works of unruh  @xcite",
    ", he discovered the dynamic analogy between the massless particles in the spacetime of schwarzschild black hole and the sound waves dominated by the radially flowing fluid .",
    "this analogy is also valid for superfluid  @xcite in which the effects associated with acoustic black hole have been observed experimentally  @xcite . in recent years , garca - meca _",
    "et  al . _",
    "combined the ideas of moving media and ta , and purposed the method of analogue transformation acoustics ( ata )  @xcite .",
    "they made use of background flow , instead of anisotropic effective media , to mimic the metric of spacetime , and to fabricate the desired acoustic devices , such as spacetime cloak and time - dependent spatial compressor . through forcing the effective metric to have a certain form , the parameters of background flow , _",
    "i.e. _ the flow velocity , the speed of sound and the mass density , can be determined .",
    "however , garca - meca _",
    "_ never discussed the feasibility of these requisite parameters of background flow , although they are not unrestricted but submitted to the laws of fluid theoretically .    in this paper",
    ", we try to reconcile the ata - determined parameters with the basic laws of fluid dynamics and show several constrains of the background flow .",
    "first , the governing equation of sound waves in ata is accurate only when the background flow is irrotational , or at least the vorticity of the flow @xmath0 should be much smaller than the frequency of sound @xmath1 , in order that the analogy between the flow fields and curved spacetime is applicable  @xcite .",
    "second , there should exist external force fields ( momentum sources ) and external mass sources in general to guarantee momentum and mass conservations of the background flow .",
    "third , since the spatial distribution of pressure and mass density are fixed after ata procedures , their relation restricts the state equation of the background fluid . as an example",
    ", we put forward a scheme for constructing spherical cloaks with background flow which complies with the realistic fluid dynamics .",
    "in addition , we investigate the propagation of sound in this cloaking system with both geometric acoustics approach and solving the wave equation analytically .",
    "our results show that the major difference of our scheme from the standard ta cloak is the phase retardation ( or lead ) effect of the sound waves traveling around the cloak . for eliminating the singularities of the parameters at the cloak surface",
    ", we introduce the unideal cloaks and evaluate their cloaking abilities .",
    "to begin with , we briefly review the framework of ata .",
    "the motion of ideal fluid ( with no viscosity and thermal conductivity ) obeys euler equation and the continuity equation which correspond to the momentum and mass conservations respectively . if the fluid is barotropic , _",
    "i.e. _ its density @xmath2 only depends on pressure @xmath3 , and the flow velocity @xmath4 is irrotational , the compressible fluid submits to the following equations  @xcite    [ fluid ]    & + ^2+h()+u()=f(t ) , + & + ( ) = m(,t ) ,    where @xmath5 is the velocity potential ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the enthalpy per unit mass , @xmath8 is the speed of sound , @xmath9 is an arbitrary integral constant with respect to time , and we have supposed the existence of the external potential of momentum source @xmath10 and the external mass source @xmath11 . indeed , there are two origins of @xmath12 , one is the external bulk force @xmath13 , the other corresponds to the mass source , thus @xmath14 ( suppose @xmath15 is integrable ) .",
    "as we will see afterward , the two external sources are necessary .",

    "this form of metric can be regarded as the generalized schwarzschild metric written in the painlev - gullstrand type coordinate system ( p - g system )  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , a major distinction between ata and ordinary ta is that one generally deals with the wave equation of sound pressure in ta , while the kernel equation of ata used to draw the analogy with curved spacetime is the equation of velocity potential . as a result , ta is restricted to design isobaric systems , whereas ata is demanded to be globally barotropic  @xcite .    according to the procedure of ata , if we let the effective metric either in p - g system or in sch .",
