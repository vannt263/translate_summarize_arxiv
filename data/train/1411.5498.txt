    "the idea for this paper was born when the author was confronted with the need of simplifying linear combinations of hyperbolic sines and cosines with the same argument into a single trigonometric expression in order to solve for that argument ( see @xcite ) . in the usual euclidean case , there are very well know formulae for the sum of linear combinations of sines and cosines .",
    "in particular , we have the phasor addition formula ( equations  are some of its incarnations ) which , somehow , is a generalization of the standard formula @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , similar formulae for the hyperbolic case seem to be absent from the literature .",
    "it is interesting to note that something that seems so trivial as a mere algebraic manipulation has profound ( and very well studied ) roots in physics , where these linear combinations ( in the euclidean case ) occur naturally when studying * phasors*. this paper is written with the intention of introducing the reader to the usual phasor formalism used in physics and the motivation behind it , containing all the rigor expected by a mathematician .",
    "it will also generalize the formulae previously derived for the hyperbolic case with the hope they may eventually become handy for the reader .",
    "to be more precise , phasors appear in physics from the need of establishing some kind of arithmetic for the set of functions @xmath1 for some fixed @xmath2 and where @xmath3 if and only if @xmath4 for any @xmath5 .",
    "the parameters present in the functions of @xmath6 are called , respectively , * amplitude * ( @xmath7 ) , * frequency * ( @xmath8 ) and * phase * ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the functions in @xmath6 occur mostly in problems related to mechanics and electronics ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , but their origin is rooted in arguably the most important problem in physics : the _ harmonic oscillator_.    if we consider one space variable @xmath10 and a time variable @xmath11 , the _ euler - lagrange equation _ of motion ( a fundamental principle of dynamics ) implies that the equation of motion of a free particle is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass of the particle and @xmath14 is a given potential .",
    "equation is , basically , _",
    "newton s second law of motion _ for the potential @xmath15 .    in many problems of physics",
    "it is common to chose as potential a quadratic function of the kind @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of _ hook s law _ on the force of a spring , but this kind of potential also occurs in problems concerning pendula ( when the angle of displacement is considered to be small ) , rlc circuits , or acoustical systems . if fact , this potential appears naturally when taking a ` first order ' approximation for small perturbations on a mass in a stable equilibrium with respect to the forces it is subject to .    hence ,",
    "considering @xmath16 , and defining @xmath18 , we have that equation can be expressed as @xmath19 which is known as the equation of the * harmonic oscillator*. the set of solutions of this equation is precisely @xmath20 ( observe that @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , the need for adding functions in @xmath6 appears in a natural way , because they are the solutions of one or more harmonic oscillators with the same constant @xmath22 .",
    "now , the question that almost any mathematician would ask is , ` what happens when @xmath23 ? ' this situation has to do with the theory of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "briefly speaking , the potential has a critical point at @xmath24 and for @xmath23 the physical laws change qualitatively .",
    "this is the case of phase transitions in matter , for instance , the change from liquid to vapor or from being a normal conductor to being a superconductor .    in this new scenario",
    ", we can define @xmath25 and the equation derived from equation is @xmath26 which has @xmath27 as set of solutions .",
    "now , can we develop a hyperbolic version of the phasor understanding of equation ?",
    "section 4 will answer this question and in section 3 we establish the basics of the phasor formalism .",
    "finally , section 5 is a brief note on the possible extensions of the phasor addition formula and a new way of obtaining it .",
    "fix @xmath28 . first of all",
    ", we will show that @xmath6 is a group using some basic group algebra .",
    "let @xmath29 the functions in @xmath6 are called * phasors*. observe that the map @xmath30 such that @xmath31 is a group isomorphism with respect to the sum .",
    "we have that @xmath6 is a subset of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , identified with the set of constant functions of @xmath32 , is a subgroup of @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 is bijective .",
    "hence , @xmath35 is a group . to see this",
    "it suffices to see that @xmath36 for any given @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 and , since @xmath33 is a group , @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 .",
    "on the other hand , consider the real part operator @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is a surjective homomorphism and @xmath43 is a surjective function .",
    "thus , @xmath6 is also a group . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 such that @xmath46 .",
    "hence , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . due to these homomorphisms between the considered groups , to study the sum in @xmath6 , it is enough to study the sum in @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath52 for some @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "observe that    @xmath55 so @xmath56 therefore , using the law of cosines , @xmath57 in order to get @xmath58 , we consider the principal argument function @xmath59 function common to the math libraries of many computer languages such as fortran @xcite , c , java , python , ruby or pearl .",
    "the principal advantage of having two arguments instead of one , unlike in the traditional definition of the @xmath60 function , is that it returns the appropriate quadrant of the angle , something that can not be achieved with the @xmath60 .",
    "some more basic information on the @xmath61 function and its usage can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atan2 . ]",
    "such that , for every @xmath62 , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the only angle in @xmath65 satisfying @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    therefore , @xmath68 .",
    "so we can conclude that @xmath69 equation is called the * phasor addition formula*.    if we want to write equation in terms of the elements of @xmath6 , we just have to take the real part on both sides of the equation :    @xmath70.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    in particular , @xmath71=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\sin[\\omega t+\\operatorname{arg}(b+ia)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this last formula , we can recover the phasor addition formula just by observing the classical trigonometric identities @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "there is an straightforward geometrical representation of the phasor addition formula in the euclidean case as figure 1 shows .",
    "[ fig2 ]     and @xmath74    the key to this graphical representation is that , on @xmath75 , the sum is the sum of vectors on the plane .",
    "then we just have to take the real part of this sum , that is , the projection onto the @xmath76 axis , to obtain the desired result .",
    "we now obtain a hyperbolic counterpart of the phasor addition formula as expressed in equation .",
    "let @xmath77 it is straightforward to check that @xmath78 is a group ( and a @xmath79-dimensional real vector space ) . taking into account the identities @xmath80 it is clear that @xmath81 it is also clear that @xmath82 and @xmath83    so we can reduce the general sums @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 to the more simple case of @xmath87 .",
    "now we prove the following hyperbolic version of the phasor addition formula .",
    "[ hyppha ] let @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 . then @xmath91    for convenience , let @xmath92",
    "we prove the case @xmath93 .",
    "the rest of the cases are proved in an analogous fashion .",
    "observe that , if @xmath93 , then @xmath94 .",
    "thus , @xmath95    one of the crucial differences between the hyperbolic and euclidean cases is that in the hyperbolic case there is not periodicity , what is more , we can not relate the hyperbolic sine and cosine by a phase displacement , which implies that we may or may not be able to express an element of @xmath96 in the form of a hyperbolic cosine depending on the values of @xmath7 and @xmath97 , as lemma [ hyppha ] shows .    also , comparing it with formula , we observe two common elements .",
    "first , the argument of the function ( euclidean or hyperbolic ) involved is @xmath98 plus a displacement depending on the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath97 .",
    "the second similitude is that , multiplying such function , there is a metric applied to the vector @xmath99 . in the euclidean case case , it is just the euclidean norm @xmath100 , that is , the square root of the metric @xmath101 on @xmath102 . in the hyperbolic case , however , we have what is called the * minkowski norm * @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the * minkowski metric * on @xmath102 of signature @xmath105 .",
    "the minkowski norm is not a norm in the usual sense ( it is not subadditive ) , but it provides a useful generalization of the concept of ` length ' in the minkowski plane .",
    "the vectors @xmath106 are called * timelike * when @xmath107 , * spacelike * when @xmath108 and * null * , or * lightlike * when @xmath109 .",
    "observe that the two first cases of equation are for spacelike vectors , the two following ones for timelike vectors , and the two last ones for lightlike vectors .",
    "it is also possible to give a geometrical representation of linear combinations of hyperbolic sines and cosines but , due to the euclidean nature of the plane , it is not as straightforward as in the euclidean case . in figure 2",
    "we illustrate how @xmath110 can be computed graphically .",
    "[ fig1 ]    ]    consider @xmath111 .",
    "the graph of the hyperbola @xmath112 satisfies that its points are of the form @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , the area between the vector @xmath113 , the hyperbola and the @xmath76 axis is half the * hyperbolic angle * @xmath114 .",
    "now , if we draw the vector @xmath115 and consider the parallelogram formed by the vectors @xmath113 and @xmath115 , the area of this parallelogram is precisely @xmath110 .",
    "the reason for this is given by the cross product formula for the area of the parallelogram and the fact that @xmath116 : @xmath117",
    "if there is anything powerful behind the concept of exponential , hyperbolic sine , hyperbolic cosine , and other trigonometric functions , it is their wide range of definition . by this , we mean that they are defined in any banach algebra with unity is just an algebra endowed with a norm @xmath118 that makes it a banach space such that @xmath119 for every @xmath120 . ] .",
    "let @xmath121 be a banach algebra and @xmath122 .",
    "we define , as usual , @xmath123 clearly , @xmath124 is just the even part of the exponential and @xmath125 its odd part , so @xmath126 .",
    "if we go back to the proof of lemma [ hyppha ] , we observe that it relies only on these kind of definitions , so it is valid for every @xmath127 and any @xmath128 in a real banach algebra with unity @xmath121 , in particular for @xmath129 .",
    "this is consistent with the euclidean phasor addition formula as we show next .",
    "let @xmath130 , assume , for instance , @xmath93 and consider @xmath131 . then , using lemma [ hyppha ] , @xmath132 =   a\\cos x+ib\\sin x\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is expected from the known fact that @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "this observation relating the generality of the definitions of the trigonometric functions suggests yet another question .",
    "is there a way to derive the hyperbolic phasor addition formula in the same way we derived it for the euclidean case ? or , to be more precise , is there a banach algebra which would fulfill the role @xmath49 played in the euclidean case ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "remember the traditional definition of the complex numbers : @xmath135 in the same way , we can define the hyperbolic numbers : @xmath136 as in the case of the complex numbers , the arithmetic in @xmath137 is the natural extension assuming the distributive , associative , and commutative properties for the sum and product .",
    "several definitions appear in a natural way , parallel to the case of @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath138 , with @xmath139 . hence @xmath140",
    "and since @xmath141 , we can define @xmath142 which is _ precisely _ the minkowski norm .",
    "it follows that @xmath143 for every @xmath144 and , if @xmath145 , then @xmath146 . if we define @xmath147 we have that @xmath118 is a norm and @xmath148 is a banach algebra , so the exponential and the hyperbolic trigonometric functions are well defined . also , it is clear from the definitions that @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath151 .      now , let @xmath152 and @xmath153 with @xmath154 .",
    "observe that @xmath155e^{j\\gamma})=a\\cosh \\gamma+b\\sinh \\gamma.\\ ] ] we try , as we do with complex numbers , to rewrite @xmath156 as @xmath157 , where @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "assume @xmath160 .",
    "then @xmath161 and @xmath162\\\\= & |a+jb|e^{\\gamma_2}\\cosh \\theta+j|a+jb|e^{\\gamma_2}\\sinh \\theta = r\\,e^{j\\theta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath163 that is , assuming @xmath93 and defining @xmath164 , @xmath165 so @xmath166 hence , @xmath167 for @xmath168 , we recover the first case of lemma [ hyppha ] .",
