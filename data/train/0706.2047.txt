    "vortex matter in type ii superconductors has been recognized as an ideal system for studying collective transports of periodic manifolds driven over the pinning environments @xcite@xcite . in particular ,",
    "much recent attention has focused on the issue of dynamic ordering , separating elasticity dominated , coherent lattice flow at large velocity , from plastically deformed , incoherent defective flow at small velocity .",
    "theoretical considerations for this phenomenon were first proposed by koshelev and vinokur by introducing a concept of shaking temperature , which characterizes fluctuating motion of vortices due to the interaction with disorder quenched in a host material @xcite .",
    "assuming the shaking temperature to decay as @xmath2 on increasing the average velocity @xmath3 , they proposed that the ordering ( crystallization ) velocity diverges as @xmath4 with a disorder parameter @xmath5 on approaching the thermal melting temperature @xmath6 from below . later , more sophisticated theoretical @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and numerical studies @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite @xcite have suggested various coherent flow states with different positional and orientational order like moving glass state and smectic flow state , and some of them have proposed multiple transitions in ordering process .    while experimental evidences for the ordering were reported in neutron diffraction and bitter decoration studies @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , investigations of the divergence at the ordering point in dc transport studies",
    "were only based on the assumption that a s - shaped anomaly in dc current - voltage characteristics marks current - induced dynamic ordering of driven vortices . in nbse@xmath0 crystals",
    "@xcite@xcite , the inflection anomaly is observed in the peak effect regime , where the critical current shows a peak in the vicinity of the second critical field @xmath7 .",
    "meanwhile in amorphous ( @xmath8-)moge thin films @xcite , instead of the peak effect , the anomaly is accompanied by a peak in the `` dynamic '' critical current , which characterizes a change of dynamic friction of vortices in the flux - flow state .",
    "these studies claimed the divergence of the ordering current around these peak behaviors and suggested the relevance of the thermal melting to the peaks of the static or dynamic pinning force .",
    "however , a study of scanning hall microscopy has shown that geometrical inhomogeneity in sample edges leads to a macroscopic coexistence of ordered and disordered flow states and their dynamic evolutions with transport current may result in similar s - shaped current - voltage characteristics @xcite @xcite .",
    "thus , it has remained controversial if the s anomaly marks the dynamic order of driven vortices .",
    "recently , mode locking ( ml ) has proved to be a powerful experimental technique for studying the dynamic ordering of driven vortex matter .",
    "ml is a dynamic resonance between internal lattice modes of a driven lattice and an ac drive superimposed on top of dc drive @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this technique directly probes the shear rigidity of driven vortices as a function of the velocity and allows us to find the dynamic ordering ( or melting ) point from the onset ( or disappearance ) of ml resonance .",
    "as demonstrated in a recent ml study on nbse@xmath0 crystals , the ordering velocity exhibits a steep increase in the peak effect regime and this defines unambiguously the thermal melting point for driven vortex lattice @xcite .    to elucidate the relevance of thermal melting to the peak behaviors of the critical current and the dynamic critical current , we will present in this article a systematic study of ml and dc transport measurements on both @xmath8-moge films and nbse@xmath0 crystals over wide magnetic field / temperature ranges",
    ". we will show how the ordering frequency ( velocity ) grows with field and diverges in the peak effect regime .",
    "we will map out field - temperature phase diagrams and show how the divergent field , together with the peak fields of the critical current and the dynamic critical current , grow with lowering temperature .",
    "we will discuss influences of quenched disorder and thermal fluctuations on the onset of ml resonance and compare the divergent points to the thermodynamic melting curve of the ideal vortex lattice proposed by a quantitative ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model @xcite . a brief comment on the peak behavior of the dynamic critical current will be made .",
    "amorphous mo@xmath9ge@xmath10 films ( @xmath11 ) were sputtered on silicon substrates mounted on a rotating copper stage held at room temperature by water cooling .",
    "the films were structured into a hall - bar shape by a liftoff technique .",
    "after partly deposition of silver on top of the films , thin gold wires were connected to the films by using small indium pieces .",
    "we used two films ( mg@xmath121 and mg@xmath122 ) with nearly identical geometry ( 1.2 mm in length @xmath13 , 0.3 mm in width @xmath14 , and 0.33 @xmath15 m in thickness @xmath16 ) and material parameters of superconducting transition temperature @xmath17 , normal resistivity @xmath18 and a slope of the second critical field near @xmath17 @xmath19 , which are given in table 1 .",
    "we determined @xmath17 from resistive transition by aslamazov - larkin fluctuation theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 for magnetic field perpendicular to the films was determined from the lowest - landau - level ( lll ) scaling analysis of fluctuation conductivity @xcite@xcite .",
    "the average composition for the films was obtained by the electron probe micro analyzer .",
    "we also used pure 2h - nbse@xmath0 single crystals grown by an iodine vapor transport method @xcite .",
    "the thinnest platelets with optically flat surfaces on both sides were cut in a bar - shape .",
    "we glued these on silicon substrates with negative resist and cleaved them without observable surface damage .",
    "after deposition of silver partly on crystal surface , thin gold wires were connected to voltage and current contacts by silver past and indium solder , respectively .",
    "the geometry and material parameters for two cleaved crystals ( ns@xmath121 and ns@xmath122 ) used in this study were also summarized in table 1 .",
    "@xmath17 was determined by the mid - point of the resistive transition , which has a transition width of about 50 mk between 10@xmath20 and 90@xmath20 of the normal state resistance at 8 k , just above @xmath17 .",
    "residual resistance ratio defined by @xmath21(295 k)/@xmath21(8 k ) is about 30 .",
    "we applied magnetic field perpendicular to the ab plane of the crystals .",
    "@xmath7 was determined from the intersection between the linear extrapolation of flow resistance and the normal resistance @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the cleaved crystals was estimated from the room temperature resistance by @xmath22 using the room temperature resistivity @xmath23 m determined before @xcite .",
    "we used oxford cryostat with a vti inset and a 17/19 superconducting magnet .",
    "we glued a sample on a copper stage at the bottom of our measurement insert , and measured temperature by using a calibrated cernox sensor attached to the stage . for measurements below 4.2 k the sample was immersed in liquid of @xmath24he introduced in the vti insert .",
    "we regulated the vapor pressure of the liquid by using a throttle valve , a capacitance manometer , a pid controller and a rotary pump . above 4.2 k",
    ", we used a temperature controller ( cryocon 62 ) , which regulates temperature of the vaporizer at the bottom of the vti insert and that of the sample stage of the measurement insert .",
    "we employed four - terminal pair method with a precision lcr meter ( hp 4285a/001 ) and nanovoltmeters ( keithley 2182 ) .",
    "the sample was wired with four - coaxial cables of which guards are connected . for a precise measurement of the ac current in the frequency range of 0.1 - 30 mhz , we calibrated the coaxial cables in two steps : first we made open and load calibrations by unwiring and wiring a 100 ohm chip resistor to the cables at the sample stage , respectively .",
    "then , the sample was connected to the cables and cooled to the lowest temperature of @xmath25 1.2 k , which is far below @xmath17 of @xmath8-moge films and nbse@xmath0 crystals used in this study .",
    "ensuring negligible contact resistance and undetectable resistance of the sample , we made short calibration as function of frequency as the second step .    during the ml measurement , we probed the dc voltage by ramping the dc - current up or down with a superimposed ac current on top .",
    "the dc current value was obtained by measuring the dc voltage over a standard resistor .",
    "other dc transport measurements of resistive transition and dc current - voltage characteristics without ac current were performed by using a dc current source ( keithley 220 ) and nanovoltmeters with proper filtering .",
    "figure 1 displays a plot of the critical current @xmath26 vs field measured in 1.96 k for mg@xmath121 . here",
    "@xmath26 is determined from dc current - voltage ( @xmath27 ) characteristics by a voltage criterion of 1 @xmath15v . as observed , on increasing magnetic field @xmath26",
    "starts to increase around 5.5 t ( the onset field ) and exhibits a broad peak around 7 t (= @xmath28 ) . above 7 t , it drops rapidly and vanishes around 7.8 t. we also plot the dynamic critical current @xmath29 , obtained by extrapolating the flux - flow behavior linearly to the zero voltage ( for definition , see the inset to fig .",
    "1 ) . this characterizes the pinning strength ( or dynamic friction ) for driven vortices in the flux - flow state . as observed",
    ", @xmath29 exhibits a pronounced peak against field : it starts to show a rapid increase around 7 t and obtains a sharp maximum at about 7.6 t ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "interestingly , the peak field ( onset field ) of the dynamic critical current does not coincide with the corresponding peak ( onset ) field for the critical current .",
    "the former appears in the higher part of the peak effect regime of the latter , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "such peak anomaly of the dynamic critical current is also observed in nbse@xmath0 crystals . in the conventional picture ,",
    "the peak in the critical current marks the pinning induced , structural transformation from weakly disordered to amorphous arrangement of vortices @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "thus , from a phenomenological point of view , another structural transformation in the flux - flow state may occur at the peak in the dynamic critical current .      in order to explore the dynamic structural change in the flux - flow state ,",
    "we have employed the ml technique . to show typical ml resonant features , we first present ml results below the peak effect regime .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "2 is a series of @xmath27 curves of mg@xmath122 measured with superimposed 10 mhz ac current of various amplitudes at 4.2 k and a field of 2.0 t ( @xmath32 3.0 t ) .",
    "a curve denoted as dc represents the pure dc @xmath27 curve without ac current @xmath33 .",
    "the application of @xmath33 induces clear ml steps at equidistant voltages denoted by @xmath34=1/1 and 2/1 .",
    "the first step corresponds to the fundamental ( @xmath351/1 ) , and the other is a higher harmonic ( @xmath34=2/1 ) .",
    "also even higher harmonics are observed at higher voltages , but are not shown . because of the ml resonant condition of @xmath36 with integers @xmath37 and the lattice spacing of vortex lattice @xmath38 , these ml voltages are directly proportional to the resonant frequency of ac current according to @xmath39 with the row spacing of vortex lattice @xmath40 and the vortex density @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "step width at the fundamental ( and also harmonic ) ml resonance varies with @xmath33 , exhibiting a oscillatory behavior like squared bessel function of the first kind of the first ( higher ) order @xcite .",
    "since the oscillatory period depends on frequency , temperature , and magnetic field , we use for consistency in the following analysis the maximum width @xmath42 of the fundamental resonance as the amplitude of the ml step width .    in fig .",
    "3(a ) we show how @xmath42 varies with frequency . at lower frequencies ( @xmath43 10 mhz ) ,",
    "the ml step width increases linearly with @xmath44 , while at higher frequencies ( @xmath45 10 mhz ) it levels off and becomes independent of @xmath44 .",
    "such behavior is reasonably described by an empirical function of @xmath46 , displayed by the solid curve @xcite . from the fit",
    "we obtain a pinning frequency @xmath47= 13 mhz and a saturated current width @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "however , the ml width at lower frequencies deviates downward from the empirical function .",
    "a linear extrapolation of the data indicated by the dotted line seems to reveal a threshold behavior of the ml width , i.e. , there is a finite frequency ( velocity ) above which the ml resonance can be observed .",
    "such threshold behavior is pronounced in the peak effect regime , as can be seen in fig . 3 ( b ) , where the frequency dependence is shown of the ml width measured at 4.2 k and magnetic fields of 3.25 t , 3.4 t , and 3.45 t ( above @xmath49 t ) .",
    "for instance , the linear extrapolation at 3.25 t clearly displays the threshold behavior at an onset frequency @xmath50 1.4 mhz denoted by an arrow . below @xmath51 , no ml resonance feature is detectable at any of the ac current amplitudes , indicating the absence of shear rigidity in the driven vortex matter .",
    "thus , @xmath51 marks a dynamic ordering frequency ( or velocity ) @xcite@xcite . when field is increased by 0.15 t to 3.4 t , @xmath51 increases by 1.7 mhz to @xmath52 3.1 mhz . with further increase of field by only 0.05 t to 3.45 t",
    ", @xmath51 shows a rapid increase by @xmath52 2.2 mhz and becomes @xmath52 5.3 mhz . in slightly higher fields an even more rapid increase of @xmath51 is observed .",
    "we summarize results of the onset frequency at 4.2 k in a semi - logarithmic plot of @xmath51 vs. magnetic field , displayed in fig .",
    "in low fields , @xmath51 ( depicted by solid diamonds ) increases slowly with field . around the peak field of the critical current ( = 3.0 t )",
    ", it turns to a rapid increase , followed by a small knee around 3.2 t. after the knee , it exhibits a diverging behavior towards just above 3.5 t. this is also displayed in a linear plot given in the inset of fig .",
    "the open symbols represent the onset frequency determined from the magnetic field dependence of the ml width @xcite .",
    "both data sets show the same diverging behavior of @xmath53 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath51 is in qualitative agreement with the dynamic ordering picture proposed by koshelev and vinokur @xcite .",
    "the dynamic crystallization frequency can be given by @xcite@xcite @xmath54 with a disorder parameter @xmath55 and the flux - flow resistivity @xmath56 .",
    "this expression qualitatively explains the divergence of @xmath51 ( or @xmath57 ) against temperature observed in an @xmath8-moge film @xcite and also in mesoscopic flow channels @xcite .",
    "moreover , as displayed by the solid curve in fig .",
    "4(b ) ( also in the inset ) , we find that the diverging behavior of @xmath51 against magnetic field is approximated well by a similar diverging function of @xmath58 with @xmath59 t ( indicated by the broken vertical line ) and @xmath60 mhz over more than one decade in frequency range .",
    "these qualitative agreements allow us to identify the field ( or temperature ) of the divergence as the thermal melting point of the coherently flowing vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "away from @xmath61 at lower fields , the situation is different . here",
    "the onset of ml resonance occurs at small frequencies ( velocities ) and the influence of quenched disorder dominates the ordering transition .",
    "the contribution of quenched disorder on @xmath51 may be determined from following arguments : the disorder parameter is given by the amplitude of the pinning correlation function of the random pinning potential which decays over the pinning radius @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "using the maximum pinning force @xmath63 per pinning site , we may write @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of pinning sites per vortex line volume , @xmath66 is the density of pinning centers , @xmath67 is the larkin - ovchinnikov pinning parameter @xcite and @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath69 , we find @xmath70 with @xmath71 we know that the pinning properties for @xmath8-moge films are well described by the delta-@xmath17 pinning , i.e. , @xmath72 with a reduced field @xmath73 @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the flux flow resistivity for the amorphous films in the gl regime can be written as @xmath74 with a reduced temperature @xmath75 @xcite . in fields measured here , i.e. , @xmath76 1.4 t/4.54 t",
    ", the function @xmath77 can be approximated by an interpolation formula @xmath78 @xcite . substituting these formula in eq .",
    "( [ f0relation ] ) , together with @xmath79 , we find that @xmath51 varies with magnetic field as @xmath80 as displayed by the dotted curve , this shows a slow increase with field away from @xmath81 and explains our results below @xmath82 .",
    "the proportionality constant extracted from the fit provides a rough estimate for the coefficient @xmath83 in the expression for the pinning strength @xmath84 , namely @xmath85n@xmath86m@xmath87 at @xmath88 0.7 @xmath17 .",
    "this value is reasonably consistent with values obtained for previous transport measurements on similar amorphous superconducting films @xcite@xcite@xcite . just above @xmath82",
    ", @xmath51 switches to a rapid increase up to the knee .",
    "this behavior follows neither the diverging behavior close to @xmath61 displayed by a solid curve nor the low field behavior by a dotted curve .",
    "it indicates a rapid enhancement of the disorder contribution ( probably the pinning parameter @xmath84 ) .",
    "since the ordering frequency ( velocity ) around @xmath82 is small and the disorder effect does not diminish significantly , this jump behavior could be related to the underlying mechanism for the peak effect , i.e. , the enhancement of the pinning force caused by structural disordering transformation of static vortices at @xmath82 @xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "we have systematically made ml and dc transport measurements in different temperatures on both @xmath8-moge films and nbse@xmath0 crystals .",
    "results commonly show that @xmath51 exhibits the jump and subsequent knee behavior around @xmath82",
    ". the diverging behavior of @xmath51 occurs always in the higher part of the peak effect regime and the divergent point lies in between the peak field and the second critical field , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "thus , observed behavior of @xmath51 allows us to separate the thermal melting marked by the divergent point from the disorder induced transformation marked by @xmath82 .      based on these findings ,",
    "let us map out a field - temperature phase diagram for @xmath8-moge films of mg@xmath121 and mg@xmath122 .",
    "to show results in two films together in fig .",
    "5(a ) , magnetic field and temperature are normalized by the gl second critical field @xmath90 and @xmath17 , respectively . for clarity ,",
    "results of mg@xmath121 and mg@xmath122 are depicted by black and red colored symbols , respectively .",
    "good agreement is visible in temperature dependencies of @xmath91 plotted for the films with solid red and black circles : on lowering temperature from @xmath92 @xmath93 increases linearly with @xmath94 displayed by a broken line . for @xmath95 , @xmath93 deviates downward from the linear dependence .",
    "such behavior is well described by the mean field curve ( displayed by the solid curve ) for the dirty limit in werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) theory @xcite , which is given by @xmath96 \\label{digamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the digamma function .    in fig .",
    "5(a ) the results of @xmath98 for the films are also depicted by solid squares .",
    "focusing on results of mg@xmath121 , we find that on lowering temperature from @xmath92 @xmath99 increases slowly and field distance between @xmath99 and @xmath100 becomes larger . with further lowering @xmath101",
    ", @xmath99 gradually increases faster and it becomes nearly parallel to @xmath100 for @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the field distance between @xmath99 and @xmath100 is nearly constant for @xmath102 .",
    "results of mg@xmath122 follow the @xmath99 curve for mg@xmath121 well . because of the thermal melting of the flowing vortex lattice marked by @xmath99 , the regime in the phase diagram between @xmath99 and @xmath100 should represent a flowing liquid of driven vortices .",
    "we also map out the field - temperature phase diagram for nbse@xmath0 crystals of ns@xmath121 and ns@xmath122 in fig .",
    "@xmath100 increases linearly with @xmath94 down to the lowest temperature measured .",
    "this is consistent with thermodynamic studies on nbse@xmath0 crystals @xcite @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the results on @xmath8-moge films , @xmath103 lies just below the mean field line except for low temperatures ( @xmath104 0.4 ) .",
    "for instance , the field distance between @xmath103 and @xmath93 at @xmath105 0.7 is 0.02 for nbse@xmath0 crystals , which is smaller than 0.08 for @xmath8-moge films . in other words ,",
    "the vortex liquid flow regime for nbse@xmath0 crystals is much narrower than that for @xmath8-moge films .",
    "this difference should be related to the strength of thermal fluctuations , which may be characterized by the ginzburg number given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is an anisotropy parameter , @xmath108 is the thermodynamic critical field at @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the coherence length for the ab plane at @xmath109 @xcite . for estimation of @xmath111 on @xmath8-moge films , we use the dirty - limit expression for @xmath112 with @xmath113^{1/2}$ ] @xcite and @xmath114 . for nbse@xmath0 crystals , we use values of the gl thermodynamic field @xmath115",
    "t and @xmath116 3 , reported in the literature @xcite@xcite . as listed in table 1 , @xmath8-moge films have a nearly identical value of @xmath117 which is two orders of magnitude larger than that for nbse@xmath0 crystals .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the broader regime of the vortex liquid flow for @xmath8-moge films .",
    "quantitative estimation of the distance between the thermodynamic melting curve and the mean field line can be made by using the recent quantitative gl result proposed by li and rosenstein ( lr ) @xcite . in their theory , the thermodynamic melting transition sets in when the lll - scaled temperature given by @xmath118 is equal to -9.5 . here @xmath119 is their ginzburg number and @xmath120 is the distance from the mean field line . substituting @xmath111 for @xmath8-moge films and nbse@xmath0 crystals from table 1",
    ", we calculated how far the melting curve is located from the mean field line ( @xmath121 ) . a solid blue curve in fig .",
    "5(a ) represents the calculated melting curve for mg@xmath121 .",
    "good agreement with @xmath99 data is visible at high temperatures ( @xmath122 0.6 ) .",
    "we note that the melting curve at low temperatures ( @xmath123 0.6 ) is not shown since clear deviations of @xmath124 from the linear dependence , which is presumed by the model , appear at low temperatures .",
    "we also display the calculated melting curve for ns@xmath121 in fig .",
    "because of small @xmath111 , the calculated melting curve lies just below the @xmath93 line .",
    "again , good agreement of @xmath99 with the melting curve is visible at high temperatures ( @xmath125 ) . taking into account that this model is valid in temperatures not far from @xmath92 , the agreements of @xmath99 with the lr model for both mg@xmath121 and ns@xmath121 having more than two orders of magnitude difference in @xmath111 are quite remarkable , providing a further link between the thermal melting point of the flowing lattice and the thermodynamic one of the static and ideal vortex lattice .",
    "we note that the influence of applied currents upon the thermodynamic properties is negligibly small @xcite .",
    "we also plot the peak fields @xmath126 of the critical current ( open circles ) in fig .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in both cases they lie below the thermodynamic melting curve ( or @xmath103 ) .",
    "this indicates that for static vortices the pinning induced , structural transformation into amorphous array of vortices occurs prior to the thermodynamic melting and therefore a crossover ( or a continuous transition ) from glassy to liquid states may occur around the thermodynamic melting point .",
    "we emphasize that in the higher part of the peak effect regime the dynamic melting features discussed above is observable only when vortices are driven fast enough and that the elasticity is recovered by the dynamical ordering from the amorphous static state .",
    "finally we comment on the peak behavior in the dynamic critical current .",
    "we find that all the peak points of the dynamic critical current observed for both @xmath8-moge films and nbse@xmath0 crystals coincide nearly with corresponding divergent points of @xmath99 ( not shown for clarity ) .",
    "this agreement is exemplified in figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) , where the peak point of the dynamic critical current occurs very close to the divergence of @xmath51 .",
    "these coincidences suggest that the peak point of the dynamic critical current could be a good indication for the thermal melting of the coherent lattice flow .",
    "however , it is not clear to us why the lower part of the peak anomaly observed in both @xmath8-moge films and nbse@xmath0 crystals change gradually and do not show a jump at the thermal ( or thermodynamic ) melting point .",
    "this gradual change is possibly be related to an extrinsic origin like inhomogeneity in samples and/or geometrical influences of edge @xcite and surface roughness @xcite .",
    "in summary , employing the mode locking technique , we have presented the dynamic ordering of driven vortex matter in the peak effect regime of both amorphous moge films and nbse@xmath0 crystals .",
    "the dynamic ordering frequency ( velocity ) marked by the onset of the ml resonance exhibits a sharp increase and subsequent knee behavior around the peak field of the critical current , followed by a striking diverging behavior in the higher part of the peak effect regime .",
    "the former jump behavior indicates the rapid enhancement of pinning contribution , probably originating from the underlying structural transformation of the static vortex lattice due to quenched disorder at @xmath82 .",
    "meanwhile the latter diverging behavior is in good agreement with the dynamic ordering model and the divergence point is identified as the thermal melting point of the driven vortex lattice .",
    "the thermal melting point measured at each temperature lies in between the peak field and the second critical field , and it coincides nearly with the peak point of the dynamic critical current . mapping out the field - temperature phase diagrams for amorphous moge films and nbse@xmath0 crystals , we find that the thermal melting points follow well the thermodynamic melting curve for the static and ideal vortex lattice over wide field / temperature ranges .",
    "these findings clearly separate the peak effect from thermal melting and provide a link between static and dynamic melting phenomena .",
