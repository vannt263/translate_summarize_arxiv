    "solar flares are very spectacular , and they are accompanied by a variety of plasma motions .",
    "for example , many ejection phenomena , such as filament / prominence eruptions are seen in the h@xmath0 line and in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) , while plasmoid ejections seen in soft x - ray ( sxr ) have been observed in association with solar flares .",
    "they have attracted attention , since they could play a key role in triggering fast reconnection . in the plasmoid - induced reconnection model , which was suggested by @xcite and @xcite as an extension of the classical cshkp model @xcite ,",
    "plasmoids generated in current sheets near reconnection points are ejected , when strong energy releases occur .",
    "the ejections of plasmoids trigger further reconnections , since they make the current sheet thinner .",
    "we often observe that plasmoids / filaments are strongly accelerated during bursts of nonthermal emissions in hard x - ray ( hxr ) and in radio @xcite .",
    "therefore , the correlations between plasmoid ejections and hxr bursts support a plasmoid - induced reconnection model .",
    "a good review of the correlation between plasmoid ejections and hxr emission is given in @xcite .",
    "flare - associated waves and the related plasma motions have also been studied .",
    "moreton waves @xcite are observed to propagate across the solar disk in h@xmath0 with speeds of 500  1500  km  s@xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they are often associated with type ii radio bursts , and thought to be due to the intersection of a coronal mhd fast - mode shock wave and the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "x - ray waves discovered with the soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ; @xcite ) on board _ yohkoh _ @xcite are the wavelike disturbances travelling in the solar corona associated with flares @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous observation of moreton waves and x - ray waves suggest that both of these wavelike disturbances are generated with the mhd fast - mode shock @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the solar x - ray imager on board _ goes _ has also observed wavelike disturbances in x - rays @xcite .",
    "coronal eit waves observed with the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ; @xcite ) on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ; @xcite ) are another coronal disturbance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these coronal disturbances have rarely been observed spectroscopically in euv and in sxr .",
    "therefore , spectroscopic observations of wavelike ejections with high spatial and spectral resolution are required to clarify the relation with the mhd fast - mode shock .",
    "these plasma motions can be observed as phenomena accompanied by line shifts ( doppler shifts ) in spectroscopic observations .",
    "the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ; @xcite ) is one of the three scientific instruments on board _ hinode _ @xcite .",
    "eis uses an off - axis parabolic primary mirror and a toroidal diffraction grating in a normal incidence optical layout , and has sensitivity for two wavelength ranges , 170  210 and 250  290   ( see @xcite and @xcite , for more details ) .",
    "these wavelength ranges are simultaneously observed with two ccds , which are called ccd - a ( for longer wavelength range ) and ccd - b ( for shorter wavelength range ) , respectively .",
    "the two dimensional euv images were obtained with the narrow slit in a raster observation by a pivot rotation of the primary mirror in the east - west direction .",
    "eis enables us to study in detail the plasma in the solar corona and upper transition region with temperature of @xmath2  k to @xmath3  k.    we found strongly blueshifted phenomena , which were associated with an intense flare that occurred 2006 december 13 observed with eis . in this paper",
    "we examined the phenomena , and discuss the relation with plasmoid ejections and/or coronal waves . in ",
    "2 we describe the observational data . in ",
    "3 we examine the detailed features of the strongly blueshifted line emission . in ",
    "4 we present a summary and conclusions .",
    "an intense solar flare , which was x3.4 on the goes scale , started at 02:14  ut , 2006 december 13 , in noaa active region 10930 ( s06@xmath4 , w22@xmath4 ) .",
    "it was the first x - class flare that _",
    "hinode _ observed ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the top panel of figure  1 shows time profiles of the flare ( from 02:10 ut to 03:00 ut , 2006 december 13 ) , in sxr obtained with the goes 1.0  8.0 ( top ) and 0.5  4.0  ( bottom ) channels .",
    "the nobeyama radio polarimeters ( norp ; @xcite ) also observed this flare .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  1 shows the time profiles of the total radio fluxes taken in norp  17 ghz ( black line ) and 35  ghz ( gray line ) channels .",
    "eis performed a wide raster scan from 01:12 to 05:41  ut , and the following nine lines were chosen to observe the flare : fe x ( 184.5  ) , fe viii ( 185.2  ) , fe xi ( 188.2  ) , ca xvii ( 192.8  ) , fe xii ( 195.1  ) , fe xiii ( 202.0  ) , he ii ( 256.3  ) , fe xiv ( 274.2  ) , and fe xv(284.2  ) .",
    "information on these lines is summarized in table  1 .",
    "we used a narrow slit of 1@xmath5 width . for each emission line , we set the observation window on the ccds with a height of 256 pixels along the slit and a width of 24 pixels in the wavelength direction .",
    "these correspond to 256@xmath5 and 0.54   , respectively .",
    "we show the raster images in the he  ii and fe  xv lines in the bottom panels of figure  2 .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of ccd - a is displaced southward in the slit direction by about 18@xmath5 , compared with that of ccd - b . in this work",
    "we have corrected for this displacement .",
    "the absolute positions of the fovs are determined with the euv images observed with other instruments as will be described below .",
    "we are focusing on the strongly blueshifted feature observed with eis . in the impulsive phase",
    "two kinds of feature are observed .",
    "one is located about @xmath6 south of the disk center , which is just south of the flare core region .",
    "this is bright in all lines , and drifts southward with a velocity of about 50  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the small box drawn with black dotted lines in the bottom right panel of figure  2 shows the position of this feature .",
    "the other blueshifted feature appears farther from the flare core site and is located @xmath7 south of the disk center .",
    "this very faint feature is seen only in high - temperature lines , and moves southward with high velocity .",
    "we call these features `` bs1 '' and `` bs2 '' , and they are discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the imaging observation of this flare in euv was performed with the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ; @xcite ) although the impulsive phase was unfortunately missed .",
    "we show the 195   images of the flare taken by trace at 02:05:25  ut ( left ) and 02:47:20  ut ( right ) in the top panels of figure  2 .",
    "we can see a dark filament lying horizontally ( i.e. , in the east - west direction ) in the western part of the active region .",
    "it can also be seen in the eis raster images until 02:20  ut .",
    "the dark filament disappeared after the flare started .",
    "soho / eit also observed the eruption of the filament in the 195   images , travelling in the southwest direction .",
    "we co - aligned the euv images obtained with eis , trace , and eit , by using the 195   data . in particular , the eis raster image was fitted with the trace preflare ( 02:05:25  ut ) image , by using the common features seen from 02:00 to 02:10  ut .",
    "the accuracy of the co - alignment between the eis and trace data for the time range is about 1@xmath5 , which is comparable to the pixel sizes of the data .",
    "the solar optical telescope ( sot ; @xcite ) and x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) on board _ hinode _ also observed this flare .",
    "the ca  ii ( h - line ) images obtained every 2 minutes with sot clearly show the two - ribbon structure ( see the top panels of figure  4 ) .",
    "xrt obtained the sxr images of this flare every 1 minute with the thin - be filter . in the sxr images we can see some ejections of bright plasmoids ( see the bottom panel of figure  4 ) .",
    "we can also see a faint arc - shaped ejection ( see the bottom panels of figure  5 ) .",
    "we will discuss these in the following section .",
    "we co - aligned the sot and xrt data with the trace data . for the co - alignment , we used common features , such as flare kernels .",
    "the accuracy of the co - alignment is also about 1@xmath5 , and therefore , we expect that the eis data are co - aligned with the sot and xrt data with an accuracy of about 2@xmath5 .",
    "this strong blueshifted feature associated with bs1 appeared from 02:23:46  ut to 02:26:24  ut in the eis fov , which corresponds to the first impulsive radio burst observed with norp ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the top panels of figure  3 show the clipped spectra of bs1 in the he  ii ( left panel ) and fe  xv ( right panel ) lines .",
    "the vertical axis is the extent along the slit ( the solar north is up ) , and the size is 224@xmath5 ( @xmath8  km ) .",
    "the horizontal axis shows the wavelength direction ( blue is to the left ) , and the width is 24 pixels in the ccds of eis , which corresponds to about 0.54   in the wavelength range .",
    "the spectra are taken at ( a ) 02:24:49  ut , ( b ) 02:25:21  ut , ( c ) 02:25:52  ut , ( d ) 02:26:24  ut , and ( e ) 02:26:56  ut , respectively .",
    "the flare core site is seen as very bright horizontal bands in the spectra , and it is saturated in the he  ii line .",
    "bs1 is located just south of the flare core region , and it drifts in the slit direction ( southward ) with a velocity of about 50  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the flare cores are seen as blob - like bright features in all the lines used for the raster .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  3 show the spectra of the blueshifted regions in the he  ii ( left ) and fe  xv ( right ) windows .",
    "the histograms shown with the solid lines are the observed spectra integrated over the blueshifted region sandwiched between the two white horizontal lines in the top panels for each emission line .",
    "the spectra are normalized with their maximum intensities .",
    "we fitted the spectra with gaussian functions . for each window ,",
    "the spectrum is divided into a main component ( dotted line ) and a blueshifted component ( solid line ) .",
    "the black thin and thick arrows point to the peaks of the main and blueshifted components , respectively .",
    "the doppler velocity is determined by the displacement between the blueshifted and the main components .",
    "although the main components themselves show displacements compared to the profiles of a quiet region ( e.g. , the bottom part of the fovs ) of less than 5  km  s@xmath1 , they are small compared with the blueshifted phenomena , and therefore , we do not take them into the following considerations .",
    "the he  ii and fe  xv lines recorded doppler velocities of about 280 and 240  km  s@xmath1 , respectively . for bs1 , the blueshifted components are brighter than the main components .",
    "we compared the features with the sot data to investigate the relation between bs1 and the flare kernels .",
    "we often observe upflow motion , associated with chromospheric evaporation @xcite , at the footpoints of flare loops .",
    "they result from sudden pressure enhancement due to bombardment by nonthermal particles and/or conduction from the coronal flare kernels .",
    "@xcite reported that the upflows of about 110  km  s@xmath1 in the fe  xix line ( log@xmath9 @xmath10 6.9 ) were observed with the _ reuven ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi _ : @xcite)at the flare kernels .",
    "the top panels of figure  4 show the ca  ii ( h - line ) images .",
    "we can see a two - ribbon structure that shows an inverse s - shape in the east - west direction .",
    "the crosses in the panels ( @xmath11 ) point to the positions of bs1 observed with eis .",
    "the x - coordinate corresponds to the slit position at that time , and the y - coordinate is the front position ( i.e. , the southern end ) of bs1 seen in the fe  xv line .",
    "we can not see any correspondences between bs1 and the bright features seen in the sot images , such as the flare ribbons .",
    "therefore , bs1 is not related to the evaporation flow .",
    "we compared the eis data with the sxr images obtained with xrt .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  4 show these images .",
    "as we mentioned , we can see a plasmoid ejection as marked with arrows .",
    "it lies horizontally , and is ejected from the flare core site in the southwest direction .",
    "the crosses in the panels again indicate the front positions of bs1 determined with the fe  xv window .",
    "we can see a remarkable correspondence in all the frames between the positions of bs1 and those of the plasmoid ejection .",
    "the ejected plasmoid travels in the xrt images with a velocity of about 90  km  s@xmath1 , which is roughly consistent with the drift speed of bs1 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that bs1 originates from the plasmoid ejection .",
    "as we mentioned above , the timing of bs1 just corresponds to the first impulsive radio burst observed with norp , which supports the plasmoid - induced reconnection model .",
    "bs1 showed doppler and drift velocities of about 240  280 and 50  90  km  s@xmath1 , respectively , which indicates that the combined velocity was about 250  300  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this value is consistent with the velocities that have been previously reported ( e.g. , @xcite examined eight x - ray plasmoid ejections observed with _ yohkoh _ , and found that the apparent velocity was 50  400  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the top panels of figure  5 show time sequences of the spectra in the fe  xv and ca  xvii windows .",
    "solar north is up and shorter wavelength ( i.e. , blueward ) is to the left .",
    "the size of each spectrum is 224@xmath5 along the slit ( vertical ) , and 24 pixels in the eis ccds ( horizontal ) .",
    "the displacement between the ccd - a and ccd - b was corrected .",
    "the times of the spectra are taken at ( a ) 02:22:11  ut , ( b ) 02:22:43  ut , ( c ) 02:23:14  ut , ( d ) 02:23:46  ut , and ( e ) 02:24:18  ut , respectively .",
    "the flare core site is seen as two very bright bands in these spectra .",
    "bs2 appeared from 02:22:11  ut to 02:24:18  ut , and went out of the eis fov just before the first impulsive radio burst was observed with norp ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "they started to appear at @xmath7 south of the disk center , which is about @xmath12 south of the flare core region .",
    "they travel along the slit , i.e. , southward , with a velocity of about 450  km s@xmath1 . furthermore ,",
    "as seen in the top panels of figure  5 , these blueshifted features broaden widely in the blue wings of the lines .",
    "these features were observed only in the fe  xv and ca  xvii windows , which are the two hottest lines contained in the raster .",
    "therefore , the plasma generating bs2 must be heated more than about 2  mk .",
    "the middle panels of figure  5 show the spectra of the blueshifted regions in the fe  xv and ca  xvii windows .",
    "the histograms shown with solid lines are the observed spectra integrated over the region sandwiched between the two white lines in the top panels for each line .",
    "the spectra are normalized with the maximum intensities .",
    "we fitted the spectra and divided them into several components .",
    "we assumed that all the components follow gaussian functions .    for the fe  xv window ,",
    "the spectrum is divided into fe  xv main component ( dotted line ) and the blueshifted component ( solid line ) .",
    "the black thin and thick arrows point to the peaks of the main and blueshifted components , respectively",
    ". the ca  xvii window ( the middle right panel ) contains fe  xi and o  v lines as well as the target ca  xvii line .",
    "we can see fe  xi and o  v lines discretely in the quiet region , while we can see the blended emission with the ca  xvii lines in the bs2 region .",
    "therefore , we have to remove those components , before we discuss the blueshift component of the ca  xvii line .",
    "first , we do not take the o  v component into consideration , since we can not see the component at all for the blueshifted region .",
    "the line is sensitive to the low temperature plasma ( log@xmath9 is 5.4 ) , and the absence is consistent with the fact that bs2 is hot .",
    "secondly , we estimate the fe  xi component in the ca  xvii window . since the fe  xi emission line in the ca  xvii window ( 192.8   ) and the left peak ( i.e. , the peak with the shorter wavelength ) of the fe  xi doublet ( 188.2   ) are a density insensitive line pair , we can estimate the intensity and the line shift compared to the quiet region from the profile of the fe  xi lines in the fe  xi window . in the middle right panel of figure  5",
    "we show them with the gray dashed line .",
    "the fe  xi component also do not show blueshift at all .",
    "the gray arrows point to the peak positions of the fe  xi in the ca  xvii window .",
    "then , after the subtraction of the fe  xi component , we divided the spectrum into ca  xvii main component ( dotted line ) and the blueshifted component ( solid line ) .",
    "the black thin and thick arrows again point to the peaks of the ca  xvii main and the blueshifted components , respectively .",
    "the peaks of the bs2 components shifted 0.089   for the fe  xv line , and 0.099   for the ca  xvii line , which correspond to doppler velocities of about 90 and 150  km  s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the blueshifted components of both lines broaden widely , and have wide fwhm of about 0.24   for the fe  xv line and about 0.21   for the ca  xvii line .",
    "the very wide fwhm of the blueshifted components indicates that bs2 has a large velocity field along the line of sight .",
    "these features in the spectra are very different from those of bs1 .",
    "we compared bs2 with the coronal features seen in the xrt images .",
    "we expect plasma motion in the xrt images at the same position as bs2 , since xrt is sensitive to high temperature plasma observed with the eis fe  xv and ca  xvii spectra .",
    "the bottom three panels of figure  5 show the xrt thin - be filter images of the flare .",
    "the arrows point to the front of the xrt arc - shaped ejection , which is travelling in the southeast direction with a velocity of about 650  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this ejection was faint compared with the other ejections seen in the xrt and trace images .",
    "the shape and the travelling direction are also different from the others which showed the rod - shaped structure and traveled in the southwest direction , similar to that associated with bs1 .",
    "these features of the ejection resemble the x - ray waves discovered with _ yohkoh_/sxt , and this disturbance is possibly generated by the mhd fast - mode shock .",
    "we roughly estimated the alfvnic mach number of bs2 , using the same method as @xcite , and found it to be about 1.4 .",
    "this result indicates that the xrt wavelike phenomena and bs2 might be a weak mhd fast - mode shock .",
    "the detailed analysis and theoretical treatment of the shock is beyond the scope of this paper . the observational confirmation of the density and temperature jumps caused by the passage of the shock waves will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "the crosses in the panels show the position of bs2 .",
    "the horizontal positions ( x - coordinate ) correspond to the eis slit position .",
    "we can clearly see the correspondence between bs2 and the ejection as part of a coronal shock wave , and therefore , we conclude that bs2 is associated with the wavelike phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , a halo - type coronal mass ejection ( cme ) associated with the flare was observed with the large angle spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ : see the _",
    "soho_/lasco cme online catalog ; @xcite ) .",
    "the eit wave travels in almost all direction from the flare site , and the clearest disturbance is seen travelling with a speed of about 570 @xmath13 150 km s@xmath1 in the southeast direction , which is almost the same as that of the xrt wave .",
    "figure  6 shows the running differences of the eit images . the 02:24:33  ut image ( bottom left panel ) suffered from scattered light in the telescope , and therefore , the wave - front is unclear . in the xrt image",
    "( top left panel ) the front of the xrt wave is indicated by the solid line , and the wave is estimated to reach the dashed line position at 02:36  ut . in the 02:36:01  ut image ( bottom right panel ) the expected position of the xrt wave is also shown by the dashed line , and we can see that the front of the eit wave is located slightly inside of the xrt wave position ( dashed line ) .",
    "bs2 recorded a doppler velocity of about 100  km  s@xmath1 while the drift velocity along the slit is about 450  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this implies that bs2 was travelling with a velocity of about 460  km  s@xmath1 and with an elevation angle of 13 degree from the plane of sky , although the doppler velocity ( 100  km  s@xmath1 ) was derived only from two points of measurement .",
    "the velocity of 460  km  s@xmath1 is slower than the typical velocity of moreton waves and/or x - ray waves .",
    "this is because the slit direction ( north - south ) is different from the direction of the arc - shaped ejection .",
    "we found two kinds of strongly blueshifted feature that were observed with _",
    "hinode_/eis to be associated with the 2006 december 13 flare .",
    "bs1 was bright in all observed lines used for the raster , and drifted southward , that is along the slit , at a velocity of about 50  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the doppler velocity is about 250  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "they are associated with the plasmoid ejection seen in xrt , while there are no corresponding flare ribbons in the ca  ii ( h - line ) images obtained with sot .",
    "therefore , we concluded that bs1 is the ejected plasma , and is not an evaporation flow .",
    "moreover , bs1 appears at the time of the first radio burst , which supports the plasmoid - induced reconnection model that shows the correlation between acceleration of plasmoids / filaments and bursts of nonthermal emissions .",
    "bs2 , on the other hand , was very faint , and showed spectra that broaden in the wavelength space .",
    "the center of the blueshifted component recorded a doppler velocity of about 100  km  s@xmath1 , the drift velocity along the slit is about 450  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these components are observed only in the hottest lines of the raster observation ( fe  xv and ca  xvii ) , and therefore , the plasmas must be heated to more than 2  mk .",
    "the bs2 region corresponds to the propagation of the coronal wavelike ejection seen in xrt images .",
    "the ejection is thought to be a mhd fast - mode shock wave , and it is the first successful spectroscopic observation of such a shock wave associated with a flare .",

    "<S> we present a detailed examination of strongly blueshifted emission lines observed with the euv imaging spectrometer on board the _ hinode _ satellite . </S>",
    "<S> we found two kinds of blueshifted phenomenon associated with the x3.4 flare that occurred on 2006 december 13 . </S>",
    "<S> one was related to a plasmoid ejection seen in soft x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> it was very bright in all the lines used for the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the other was associated with the faint arc - shaped ejection seen in soft x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> the soft x - ray ejection is thought to be an mhd fast - mode shock wave . </S>",
    "<S> this is therefore the first spectroscopic observation of an mhd fast - mode shock wave associated with a flare . </S>"
