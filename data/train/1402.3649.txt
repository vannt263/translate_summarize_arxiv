    "the performance of a thermoelectric ( te ) material depends on the dimensionless figure of merit , zt , given by @xmath1 , where s , @xmath2 , t and @xmath3 are the seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity , absolute temperature and the thermal conductivity ( which includes both electronic @xmath4 and lattice contribution @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 ) respectively , the efficiency of a thermoelectric device increasing with zt .",
    "the best of the commonly available te materials have a value of zt to be of the order of unity.@xcite from the above expression for zt , it is evident that finding materials with high zt ( more than unity ) still remains an open challenge , as it needs to satisfy the conflicting requirement of high thermopower like an insulator and behave as a good conductor like a metal . also it implies the need for materials with good electrical conductivity and poor thermal conductivity resulting in weak electron scattering and strong phonon scattering .",
    "in last few years efforts have been made for identifying strategies to improve the value of the zt .",
    "several reports have been published by different research groups with focus on band structure engineering to enhance s and @xmath2 and usage of nanostructure technology for reducing the lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "recently , xun shi et al,@xcite reported that the multiple - filled skutterudites show an improved figure of merit of 1.7 at 850 k , which is the highest value reported in skutterudites .",
    "biswas et al.,@xcite reported that pbte - srte doped with na shows a zt of 2.2 at 923 k due to the hierarchical structure which maximises the phonon scattering .",
    "there are well known constraints in developing good te materials , like toxicity and scarcity of the elements which prevent the usage of above materials in large scale industrial application .",
    "nevertheless , the search for such new te materials still continues despite the above mentioned restrictions .",
    "recently , the natural minerals of the tetrahedrite ( cu@xmath7m@xmath8sb@xmath9s@xmath10 ) and tennantite ( cu@xmath7m@xmath8as@xmath9s@xmath10 ) , where m is a transition metal element such as zn , fe , mn , or ni , have shown potential thermoelectric application due to their intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity.@xcite such studies have motivated us to explore thermoelectric properties of other family of minerals such as fese@xmath0 and fete@xmath0 .",
    "the reason behind selecting the transition metal chalcogenides family is due to their excellent optical and magnetic properties,@xcite and the potential for widespread applications .",
    "recently , the polymorphic phases of fese@xmath0 have been shown to be good for solar cell absorber application.@xcite several experimental reports are available attempting to understand the electrical resistivity , hall coefficient and thermoelectric power of these compounds . the electrical resistivity and hall coefficient of fese@xmath0",
    "have been measured in sintered poly - crystals.@xcite dudkin _ et .",
    "al . , _ have measured the electronic resistivity of fete@xmath0 .",
    "the same authors have also reported the thermoelectric properties of fese@xmath0 and fete@xmath0 , measured at ambient temperature and the high temperature results have been reported by harada.@xcite the thermoelectric properties of pyrite - type fese@xmath0 and fete@xmath0 prepared at high pressure of 65 kbar was given by bither _",
    "al._@xcite there are no theoretical studies on these compounds to understand thermoelectric properties .    in this work",
    ", we present a detailed theoretical study of electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of both the marcasite and pyrite phases of fex@xmath0(x = se , te ) , for which the available experimental data are indicative of good te potential , which however is not realized so far",
    ". the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the method used for the calculations and section iii presents the results and discussion , followed by conclusion in section iv .",
    "all the total energy calculations based on first principle density functional theory ( dft ) were performed using pseudopotential method as implemented in the plane wave self - consistent field ( pwscf ) program @xcite and full - potential linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k.@xcite the pwscf method is used to perform the structural optimization , whereas fp - lapw method is used to study the electronic and transport properties .",
    "the total energies are obtained by solving the kohn - sham equations self consistently within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite a plane wave kinetic energy cut off of 50 ry is used and the first brillouin zone in the reciprocal space is sampled according to the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite by means of a 8x8x8 k - mesh in order to ensure that the calculations are well converged .",
    "the electron - ion interactions are described by vanderbilt type ultrasoft pseudo potentials @xcite and the following basis sets fe : 3s@xmath11 3p@xmath12 3d@xmath12 4s@xmath11 , se : 4s@xmath11 4p@xmath13 and te : 5s@xmath11 5p@xmath13 are used as valence states .",
    "variable - cell structural optimisation has been performed by using bfgs ( broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ) conjugate gradient algorithm as implemented in pwscf . to determine the ground state structure of fese@xmath0 and fete@xmath0 and possible phase transformation , we have calculated the total energy with applied hydrostatic pressure for both marcasite and pyrite crystal structures ranging from -8 gpa ( expansion ) to 8 gpa ( compression ) with a step size of 1 gpa .",
    "the threshold criteria of 1 @xmath14 ry for total energies , 1 @xmath15 ry / bohr for total forces and 0.002 gpa for total stress were used for structural relaxation at each pressure .    to study the electronic properties ,",
    "we have used fp - lapw method as implemented in the wien2k code .",
    "as it is well known , the first principles calculations often underestimate the band gap within the standard local scheme of the exchange - correlation functional ( lda or gga ) and they also fail to describe accurately the localised electrons in _ d _ or _ f _ states , in transition metal and rare earth compounds.@xcite in order to overcome these drawbacks of the standard exchange methods , we have used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) along with the onsite coulomb repulsion u ( gga+u ) . here",
    "we have used 1000 k - points for calculating the electronic structures of both marcasite and pyrite forms .",
    "all our calculations are performed using the optimized parameters from the pwscf calculation with an energy convergence up to 10@xmath16 ry per unit cell between the successive iterations .",
    "further we have calculated the properties like thermopower ( s ) , electrical conductivity ( @xmath17 ) using boltztrap@xcite code with as many as 100 000 k - points , within the rigid band approximation ( rba)@xcite and the constant scattering time ( @xmath18 ) approximation ( csta ) . according to the rba approximation , doping a system",
    "does not alter its band structure but varies only the chemical potential , and it is a good approximation for doped semiconductors to calculate the transport properties theoretically when doping level is not very high.@xcite however certain types of dopant can drastically modify the nature of electronic structure near the gap giving rise to resonant states@xcite in which case the rba can fail.@xcite according to csta , the scattering time of the electron is taken to be independent of energy and depends only on concentration and temperature .",
    "the detailed explanation about the csta is given in ref . and the references cited therein .",
    "it is evident that csta has been quite successful in the past in predicting the thermoelectric properties of many materials.@xcite",
    "fese@xmath0 and fete@xmath0 crystallize in both the marcasite and the pyrite structures.@xcite the marcasite form of both the compounds are available in nature whereas pyrite structure is a synthetic mineral . the atomic arrangements of the marcasite phase can be considered within either of the two space groups _",
    "pnn2 _ or _",
    "pnnm_. however , we did not find any significant energy difference between these two arrangements ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) for fete@xmath0).@xcite in general , most marcasite type minerals are available in the space group _ pnnm _ , and hence we have used this space group for detailed electronic structure calculations for both the compounds . in order to verify their structural relation between the marcasite and pyrite we have calculated the total energy under the application of the hydrostatic pressure from -8 to 8 gpa . the total energy variation with the pressure for both the compounds",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we find an energy difference of 1.9 mry / unit cell between the marcasite and pyrite structures of fese@xmath0 , whereas we found the energy difference between the marcasite and pyrite phases of fete@xmath0 to be 3.5 mry / unitcell ( see fig .",
    "the optimized structural parameters are shown in table - i along with available experimental results .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is quite good .",
    "the electronic properties of fex@xmath0 ( x = se , te ) are calculated using the optimized parameters obtained from the pwscf calculations . since lda / gga underestimate the band gaps in semiconductors and insulators , and as the studied compounds have partially filled fe d - levels , we used gga+u method and adjusted u to get a reasonable value of the band gap . in our calculations we have used a value of u@xmath19 = 0.52 ry ( 7.07 ev ) for the fe _ d _ electrons in both the structures and both the compounds .",
    "this value of u is slightly on the higher side compared to values used in the literature ( 3 - 5 ev ) for metals and semiconductors .",
    "the calculated band structures along high symmetry directions in the brillouin zone for both the compounds and both marcasite and pyrite structures are shown in figs . 2 - 5 , along with the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "both the compounds are indirect band gap semiconductors irrespective of their crystal structures . from the partial density of state ( pdos ) analysis",
    ", we find that there is a strong hybridization between fe-_d _ and chalcogen _ p_-bands .",
    "d_-bands are partially filled and se _",
    "p_-bands are partially empty .",
    "the top of the valence band is predominantly fe-_d _ whereas the bottom of the conduction band is predominately chalcogen _",
    "p_. however a closer look at the pdos shows that the states within an energy range 0.25 ev just below the valence band maxima ( vbm ) ( responsible for charge and energy transport ) are equal mixture of fe-_d _ and chalcogen _ p _ states . in contrast , the states near the bottom of the conduction band minima ( cbm ) are mostly of chalcogen _ p_-character . in the marcasite phase of fese@xmath0 ( m - fes2 ) ,",
    "the cbm and vbm are located along the @xmath20 - y and @xmath20 - x directions respectively whereas for fete@xmath0 ( m - fete@xmath0 ) they are along the @xmath20 - y and @xmath20 - x directions , although there is another cbm along the @xmath20 - z direction nearby in energy .",
    "in contrast , in the pyrite phase both of them ( p - fese@xmath0 and p - fete@xmath0 ) show similar behavior , cbm is at the @xmath20 point and the vbm lies along the @xmath20 - m direction . quite interestingly ,",
    "in p - fete@xmath0 , there are other nearly degenerate vbm along the @xmath20 - x directions .",
    "the nature of cbm and vbm and states near their neighborhood will have significant effect on the thermoelectric properties of these two compounds , as discussed later in the paper .",
    "the theoretical values of the band gaps are 1.23 ev for m - fese@xmath0 and 0.69 ev for p - fese@xmath0 , in good agreement with earlier theoretical calculations by ganga _ et al_@xcite given in table - ii .",
    "the corresponding band gaps in the te compounds are respectively 0.33 and 0.34 ev .",
    "the overall reduction in band gap in tellurides is consistent with other known chalcogenides ( bi@xmath0se@xmath21 , bi@xmath0te@xmath21 etc where the gap decreases in going from se to te ) .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the band gap to the structure in fese@xmath0 and lack thereof in fete@xmath0 is an important difference between these two compounds . as regards comparison with experiment ( see table ii ) , theoretical values of the band gap in m - fese@xmath0 ( 1.234 ev in this work using gga+u and 0.86 ev by ganga et al using gga ) are in reasonable agreement with experiment ( 0.95 - 1.03 ev ) .",
    "gga underestimates whereas gga+u overestimates the band gap .",
    "however in m - fete@xmath0 the discrepancy between theory ( 0.328 ev using gga+u ) and experiment ( 0.92 ev ) is quite large and in the wrong direction compared to m - fese@xmath0 .",
    "we expect experimental band gap in m - fete@xmath0 should be smaller than that of m - fese@xmath0 . in view of this",
    "we are calling for more experiments on the optical properties on fete@xmath0 to measure its band gap . to further understand the difference between the two compounds we have calculated the effective masses in the neighborhood of different vbm and cbm .",
    "the calculated results are shown in table - iii .",
    "rapid increase in the dos near the cbm in the marcasite phase for both the compounds suggests that these will be excellent n - type thermoelectric .",
    "in contrast , the pyrite structure is more favorable to p - type thermoelectric due to multiple valence band extrema close in energy .",
    "these qualitative ideas will be tested by explicit calculations of thermopower in the next section .      from the analysis of the dos , the sharp increase in the dos at the band edge",
    "suggests that the investigated compounds may have good thermoelectric properties , particularly large thermopower . to further explore this ,",
    "we have studied the thermoelectric properties of both the marcasite and pyrite fex@xmath0 using boltzmann transport equation as implemented in boltztrap code.@xcite all the properties are calculated using rigid band approximation ( rba)@xcite and the relaxation time @xmath18 is assumed to be independent of energy.@xcite in table iii we see that the effective masses change with symmetry directions for both m and p structures . since most of the experiments are done in poly - crystalline samples , we have calculated the average of thermopower and conductivity over three orthogonal axes .",
    "the calculated thermoelectric properties such as thermopower ( s in @xmath22 v / k ) , electrical conductivity ( @xmath17 in @xmath23 ) and power factor scaled by @xmath18 ( @xmath24 in @xmath25 ) for both the electron ( n@xmath26 ) and hole ( n@xmath27 ) dopings are given in fig .",
    "the melting temperatures of the marcasite phase of both the compounds are around 850 k , so we have calculated these properties up to 800 k for this structrure .",
    "the pyrite structure on the other hand is found to be stable up to 1300 k , and we have calculated s and @xmath24 up to 1200 k.    the observed reduction in the absolute value of the thermopower with decrease in the concentration is a peculiar feature of bipolar conduction ( both electrons and holes contribute significantly to transport ) at fixed temperature which we have seen in the case of p - fese@xmath0 ( fig.7 ) , m- and p - fete@xmath0 ( fig.8 and 9 ) which is due to the small band gaps of these compounds ( see table ii ) . from fig .",
    "6 , we find that in m - fese@xmath0 the thermopower values are almost similar for both electron and hole doping , whereas the electrical conductivity is higher in the case of hole doping in comparison with the electron doping .",
    "a similar behaviour is also seen in the power factor values . for p - fese@xmath0 , we have seen that up to @xmath28 600 k all the thermoelectric quantities are better in the hole doping case which is also consistent with the results of dos , but at high temperatures ( 800 k and 1000k ) we find evidence of bipolar conduction .",
    "so p - fese@xmath0 can be a good thermoelectric up to 600 k. in the case of m - fete@xmath0 we find that electron doping is more favourable compared to the hole doping , whereas in p - fete@xmath0 hole doping is favourable compared to electron doping .",
    "we find evidence of bipolar conduction in m - fete@xmath0 above at 600 k and p - fete@xmath0 above 800 k. so both m- and p - fete@xmath0 can be used as thermoelectric material below 600 k.    as per the earlier study , the optimum value of the magnitude of @xmath29 usually falls in the region of 200 - 300 @xmath22 v / k to get a figure of merit ( zt ) to be @xmath281 . in our study the hole concentration is between 2.10@xmath30 , 1.78@xmath31 for m- and p - fese@xmath0 respectively . in case of fete@xmath0 the optimum value in the marcasite phase",
    "is found in the electron concentration range of 1.46@xmath32 and for the pyrite phase it is found for the hole concentration range 1.36@xmath33 at 600 k.    our theoretical results for @xmath29 are compared with the earlier experimental work of harada,@xcite and can be compared with the thermopower values at room and high temperature for the m - fese@xmath0 structures .",
    "for marcasite the hole and electron concentrations are found to be 5.8@xmath34 and 8.5@xmath35 for a thermopower of + 320 @xmath36 and -120 @xmath36 at 300 and 600 k , respectively .",
    "similarly , for m - fete@xmath0 we find the hole and electron concentration to be 9.2@xmath35 and 1.4@xmath37 for the thermopower values of 96 @xmath36 and -74 @xmath36 at 300 and 600 k. the experimental data on thermoelectric power and electrical conductivity is used to obtain an estimation of the relaxation time @xmath18 .",
    "we find @xmath18 to be 1.01@xmath38 _ s _ and 2.38@xmath38 _ s _ for fese@xmath0 at 300 and 600 k respectively .",
    "similarly , for m - fete@xmath0 @xmath18 is found to be 2.3@xmath39 _ s _ and 3.1@xmath39 _ s _ respectevely .",
    "we can clearly see that the relaxation time of m - fese@xmath0 is lower that that of m - fete@xmath0 , and hence one could expect that fese@xmath0 shows better te properties than fete@xmath0 .",
    "overall , both marcasite and pyrite phases of the investigated compounds are good candidates for thermoelectric properties , and marcasite fese@xmath0 is found to be the best thermoelectric material among all the compounds studied . in order to evaluate these compound s figure of merit zt , one should have experimental measurements of their thermal conductivities .",
    "the structural and electronic transport properties of marcasite and pyrite phases of fex@xmath0 are studied using density functional theory .",
    "we did nt find any structural transition between the marcasite and pyrite , and also found that marcasite structure of both the compounds are energetically stable than the pyrite structure .",
    "the calculated ground state properties of fex@xmath0(x = se , te ) agree quite well with the available experiments .",
    "electronic structure calculations show that all the investigated compounds are indirect band gap semiconductors , in good agreement with earlier reports .",
    "we further calculated the thermoelectric properties of the these compounds and compared with the available experimental reports .",
    "the calculations show all the investigated compounds to be very good thermoelectric materials for p - type doping , except marcasite fete@xmath0 which favours electron doping . among all the studied compounds we find marcasite fese@xmath0 to be a good p - type thermoelectric material .",
