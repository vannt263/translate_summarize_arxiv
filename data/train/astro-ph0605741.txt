    "one of the best studied star - forming regions is w75n which is embedded in a dense molecular cloud ( hunter et al .",
    "1994 ) . in the core of the cloud",
    "there are several young massive stars exciting compact h  ii regions .",
    "these are related to oh , h@xmath0o and ch@xmath1oh masers ( haschick et al .  1981 , hunter et al .",
    "1994 , minier , conway & booth  2001 ) .",
    "high angular resolution mapping of the masers has shown that the maser emission is concentrated in clusters which tend to be associated with the known ultra - compact h  ii regions vla1 and vla2 ( nomenclature is from torrelles et al .",

    "most of the oh maser spots are associated with vla1 , forming an elongated arc with a velocity gradient , which can be modelled by a rotating disk ( slysh et al .",
    "the magnetic field in these spots has a typical oh - maser value of several mg .",
    "near vla2 only two 1665-mhz oh maser spots were found in 1998 . in 2000",
    "a strong flare of oh maser emission from w75n was discovered .",
    "it was detected in vlba and evn observations , as well as in our single dish observations in april 2001 , at the declining phase of the flare .",
    "it is possible that this flare was a precursor of an even stronger , 1000-jy flare , which started two years later ( alakoz et al .",
    "the oh maser w75n is unusual in showing several polarized spectral features with a high degree of linear polarization ( slysh et al .",
    "2002 ) . here",
    "we report on high angular resolution vlbi observations of the oh maser in w75n , in which several maser spots with a very strong magnetic field , were found to accompany a major flare of oh maser emission .",
    "the new observations of the oh maser w75n were conducted on 2001 january 01 with the vlba in the snapshot mode of 6-min duration .",
    "the velocity resolution was 0.176 km s@xmath2 , with 256 spectral channels covering 45 km s@xmath2 in each of the oh main lines at 1665 and 1667 mhz .",
    "in addition , we reduced and analyzed the evn observations , with the same velocity resolution , from the evn archive ( project ep037b ) of 2000 september 27 , performed three months earlier , with a velocity coverage of 90 km s@xmath2 .",
    "other relevant observations are available from the public vlba archive .",
    "these are for 2000 november 22 and 2001 january 6 , and were recently published ( project bf064 , fish et al .",
    "these observations are especially interesting because they were conducted two months before and 5 days after our observations .",
    "the vlba archive observations had the same spectral resolution as ours but the velocity coverage was only 22.5 km s@xmath2 which is a factor of two less .",
    "this velocity coverage was not sufficient for detecting widely separated zeeman pairs with strong magnetic field .",
    "however at 1667 mhz where the _ g_-factor is 0.6 of 1665-mhz _ g_-factor the velocity coverge is large enough even for the zeeman pairs with the strong magnetic field which are the topic of the present study .",
    "all three sets of data have been obtained during the maximum phase of the oh maser flare .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard way using nrao software package aips .",
    "images of w75n were constructed for all spectral channels which had enough signal . only those maser spots which were present in at least two spectral channels",
    "were considered as detected .",
    "gaussian fitting and beam deconvolution were carried out using the task sad of aips .",
    "most of the maser spots were unresolved by the synthesized beam . the absolute position given in table 1",
    "was measured through fringe rates using aips task frmap .",
    "both the evn spectrum of 2000 september 27 and the vlba spectrum of 2001 january 1 , taken 96 days later , of w75n show all the spectral features which were identified in the 1998 spectrum by slysh et al .",
    "1 shows the 1665-mhz spectra in stokes _ i_. the labels are the same as in the 1998 spectrum .",
    "additionally , two new strong spectral features have appeared since the 1998 observations , at the low - velocity side of the spectrum .",
    "they are _ p1 _ ( _ p_recursor ) , with the flux density of 120  jy becoming the strongest feature , and _",
    "p2_. on the other hand , two relatively strong spectral features from the 1998 spectrum , _ j _ and _ k _ , became a factor of 3 weaker in 2000 - 2001 spectra .",
    "in fact the feature _ k _ is so weak compared to _",
    "p2 _ which is at nearly the same velocity , that it is not seen in the spectrum ; however it has been found on maps as is shown in fig .",
    "it is also evident from the spectra of fig .  1 that the new flare features were rapidly evolving in about a three months time interval , between 2000 september 27 ( evn ) and 2001 january 1 ( vlba ) : _ p1 _",
    "has increased by a factor of 2 , and _",
    "p2 _ has strengthened even more , almost by an order of magnitude .",
    "four months later , on 2001 april 12 _ p1 _ and _ p2 _ have become weaker by a factor of 5 and 2 respectively as observed with the bear lake 64-m single dish telescope ( alakoz et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the same time interval",
    "the rest of the spectral features , from a to h , remained unchanged .",
    "all constant features are connected t0 the ultra - compact h  ii region vla1 while the variable features are connected to vla2 ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the radial velocities of _",
    "p1 _ and _ p2 _ are only about 0.7 km s@xmath2 lower than those of _",
    "j _ and _ k _ , respectively .",
    "one possibility is that the flare occurred at the site of _ j _ and _ k_. mapping results however do show that _ p1 _ , _",
    "p2 _ and _ j _ , _ k _ are separate features , and all of them are present in the 2001 image ( fig .  2 ) . both _",
    "j _ and _ k _ remain at the same position as in 1998 , but are much weaker .",
    "_ p1 _ , _ p2 _ and a weaker feature _ p3 _ have emerged not far from _ j _ and _ k _ , closer to the continuum source vla2 .",
    "compared to the 1998 map ( slysh et al .",
    "2002 ) several additional spots have been detected , partly due to a higher sensitivity of new observations .",
    "one of the new features has completed a zeeman pair with the spot _ h _ ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the other features are really new because they are related with the flare which took place between 1998 and 2000 .",
    "also , more accurate absolute positions of oh spots were obtained and are given in table  1 , as well as the positions of the 1667 mhz spots relative to the 1665 mhz spots . the new map presented in fig .",
    "2 shows the position of the oh maser spots relative to the position of continuum source vla2 ( adopted from shepherd et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ) .",
    "the combined error of the absolute positions of the continuum source vla2 and oh masers is estimated here as 40 milliarcseconds ( mas ) while the separation between vla2 and the nearest oh maser spots is 55  mas .",
    "the relative position errors of the maser spots are typically less than 1  mas .",
    "the seven zeeman pairs found in w75n 2000 - 2001 spectra , are given in table 1 .",
    "all of them have been identified as pairs of zeeman components based on positional coincidence to within a fraction of the beam .",
    "the pairs are @xmath3-components , with opposite sense of circular polarization .",
    "the requirement of the positional coincidence between zeeman components is very stringent and is based on the nature of zeeman splitting .",
    "each molecule is emitting all zeeman components simultaneously as the molecule is precessing in the magnetic field .",
    "the precession causes modulation of the emitted wave which results in splitting of the monochromatic spectrum into several components with different amplitude , frequency , and polarization .",
    "thus each group of molecules with the same orientation relative to the magnetic field direction emits the same pattern of zeeman spectrum . in the case of oh molecules",
    "this means that every molecule emits both rcp and lcp @xmath3-components , at their respectively shifted frequencies . on the map positions of true @xmath3-components",
    "must coincide . since in w75n at 1665 mhz most of the maser spots are unresolved by the vlba beam and appear as point - like sources , any observed position difference between @xmath3-components can be attributed to position measurement errors caused by low signal - to - noise ratio or to a misalignment between rcp and lcp beams . in this study",
    "we adopt 5 mas as the maximum separation between zeeman pairs which is small enough to exclude chance coincidences , even in the presence of clustering of the maser spots . fig .",
    "3 shows one of the new zeeman pairs @xmath4 in the 1665 mhz spectrum of w75n , composed of the lcp - spot _",
    "p3 _ at 0.48 km s@xmath2 ( grey scale ) and the rcp - spot at 24.40 km s@xmath2 ( contours ) .",
    "both spots are unresolved by the vlba beam , and their positions coincide within 1.6 mas which is comparable to the position measurement errors .",
    "this pair of the maser spots can be regarded as a pair of true zeeman @xmath3-components as well as the rest of the pairs in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in addition to zeeman pairs found in 1998 observations ( slysh et al .",
    "2002 ) several new ones are reported here .",
    "the first is the zeeman counterpart to spot h , at 7.24 km s@xmath2 corresponding to a magnetic field strength of 3.6 mg ( @xmath5 in table  1 ) .",
    "this pair is associated with the ultra - compact h  ii region vla1 as well as two other pairs @xmath6 and @xmath5 , in table  1 .",
    "four new zeeman pairs are found in association with the ultra - compact h  ii region vla2 .",
    "the pairs @xmath7 associated with vla2 are quite remarkable .",
    "they show a very strong magnetic field , from 36.3 to 42.5  mg .",
    "another property of the vla2 zeeman pairs is the apparent uniformity of the magnetic field across at least 100  au ( 50  mas ) : the field strength is equal within 10 per cent in four spots , and has the same direction .",
    "such a large field is unusual for oh masers , typically it does not exceed 8  mg ( fish et al .",
    "two outstanding zeeman pairs in the survey of fish et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in w51e2 have magnetic field strength of 20  mg which is only half of the field of the new zeeman pairs in w75n .",
    "there have been several reports of flares for the high - velocity 1667-mhz masers .",
    "for example , spectrum of w75n obtained in 1973 at onsala shows so called elldr transient in the right circular polarization in the velocity range from 20 to 30 km s@xmath2 ( yngvesson et al .  1975 ) .",
    "the high - velocity instead may be a result of the large zeeman velocity shift in the strong magnetic field , such as reported in this paper .",
    "hutawarakorn , cohen & brebner  ( 2002 ) located a flare in 1986 near vla2 with the lower resolution of merlin .",
    "in addition to zeeman pairs @xmath8 and @xmath9 listed in their table  7 there is probably one more zeeman pair in table  4 consisting of an rcp - component at 22.5 km s@xmath2 and an lcp - component(s ) at radial velocities 1.2 , 2.6 , or 4.2 km s@xmath2 , with a separation between 8 and 21  mas which is less than the estimated relative position error of 45  mas .",
    "if real , this flaring zeeman pair has a magnetic field strength of about 55  mg .",
    "the location of the flare is within 15 mas from our 1667-mhz zeeman pair @xmath10 in table  1 .",
    "these authors made an interesting comment that a powerful magnetic field might be an explanation , among others , of the high velocities in the flare .",
    "the flare was not present in our 1998 data .",
    "similar to oh - masers , the water masers in w75n are located in two clusters around vla1 and vla2 .",
    "torrelles et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found a shell of water masers around the ultra - compact h  ii region vla2 with a radius of 160  au . the shell is expanding with a velocity of 28 km s@xmath2 , perhaps episodically , as one in a recurrent outflow .",
    "the high magnetic field oh maser spots @xmath7 are located very close to vla2 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , at a distance of 55 @xmath11  mas , or at the projected distance of 110 @xmath12  au . therefore ,",
    "the oh masers may well be located in the same shell as the water masers .",
    "the magnetic field in water masers associated with star - forming regions is typically around 100  mg ( sarma et al .",
    ". somewhat higher magnetic field , up to 500  mg , was measured in cepheus  a water maser ( vlemmings et al .",
    ". for w75n fiebig & gsten  ( 1989 ) give an upper limit of the line - of - sight magnetic field strength of 34  mg for the maser line at 12.3 km s@xmath2 . with a single - dish telescope",
    "they could not relate this line with a particular ultra - compact h  ii region .",
    "both vla1 and vla2 might have a line with such radial velocity ( see torrelles et al .",
    "1997 ) . assuming that 100  mg is a typical value for the magnetic field strength of water masers , which is an order of magnitude higher than in typical oh masers , we find that the field is of the same order as in the oh maser flare of w75n reported here .      the ultra - compact h  ii regions vla1 and vla2 are excited by massive b - stars of about 10 m@xmath13 ( shepherd et al .",
    "apparently , the exciting star for vla2 is more active than that of vla1 .",
    "the appearance of new , strong maser features _",
    "p1 _ and _ p2 _ near vla2 , as well as the almost simultaneous dimming of nearby features _ j _ and _ k _ was interpreted as a passage of an mhd shock from _",
    "j _ and _ k _ to _ p1 _ and _ p2 _ ( alakoz et al .",
    "the shock was probably generated by the exciting star of vla2 , and was propagating in the gas of the stellar wind .",
    "later , the shock reached another site of oh molecule concentration and produced an even more powerful flare of the maser emission , with a flux density of 1000  jy ( fig . 5 in alakoz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) .",
    "the results of observations of this flare will be a subject of a separate publication .        the magnetic field strength measured in oh maser features may have its origin in the 10 m@xmath13 exciting stars of vla1 and vla2 .",
    "the flare features with a magnetic field strength of 40  mg are located at the projected distance of 110  au from vla2 .",
    "the star may be emitting a stellar wind which has @xmath14 distance density dependence .",
    "if the magnetic field energy density @xmath15 has a similar dependence on distance as would be the case of the energy equipartition then the magnetic field @xmath16 would scale with distance as @xmath17 .",
    "hence , 40  mg at 110  au from the star would correspond to 110  g at the base of the stellar wind , at a distance 6@xmath18 cm from the centre of the star , close to the star surface .",
    "if the true distance is larger than the projected distance the surface magnetic field of the star would be accordingly stronger , say 500  g. such a field seems to be quite reasonable for young massive stars .",
    "recently , a magnetic field of 1300  g was measured in one of the orion trapezium cluster o - stars @xmath19 orionis c ( wade et al .  2006 ) .",
    "other ( non - flare ) zeeman pairs which show weaker magnetic field strengths , are located farther away from the stars , at the projected distance of about 2000  au . at this distance",
    "the stellar wind s magnetic field strength is a factor of 20 weaker , that is about 2.5  mg .",
    "this is a typical value for the magnetic field strength in the non - flare oh maser features .",
    "therefore , the high value of the magnetic field strength in the flare features is due to their proximity to the exciting star .",
    "another possible source for the strong magnetic field in oh masers is a shock compression of gas .",
    "the zeeman pairs are located in the common shell with water masers .",
    "if we assume the magnetic field strength in water masers to be 100  mg and a gas density of @xmath20 @xmath21 then for oh masers with a magnetic field strength of 40 mg the gas density must be 1.6@xmath22 @xmath21 , if the density scales as _",
    "@xmath23_. this is a factor 50 to 100 higher than theoretical density estimates for oh masers , although gray , hutawarakorn & cohen  ( 2003 ) used an even higher density of 4.95@xmath22 @xmath21 in their model of polarized oh maser emission in w75n .",
    "the magnetic field of the maser spots is the general interstellar field enhanced by gas compression .",
    "both direct and reverse mhd shocks may be generated by recurrent outflows leading to the density enhancement at maser spot locations .",
    "in such a model one is not expecting to observe a large physical motion for the maser spots in proper motion measurements .",
    "rather , the shock motion causes consecutive brightening of the maser spot objects encountered by the shock .",
    "this is the christmas tree model of maser emission variations , with lights flashing at fixed positions , as opposed to a model of physical motion for the maser spots .",
    "the maser spot objects can be pre - existing gas condensations which are excited by the passing shock",
    ".      the magnetic field of the maser spots can also be intrinsic to the maser spot objects .",
    "every maser spot object may have its own magnetic field originating in a dense magnetized , solid or liquid core such as a rotating planet orbiting the central star .",
    "the maser emission is generated in an extended water ",
    "methanol gas envelope which is formed by sublimation from the solid icy cover of the planet .",
    "oh molecules are produced from water by dissociation as in comets .",
    "such a model of masers was proposed by slysh et al .",
    "these envelopes can be energized by mhd shocks from the stellar wind in the same way as in previous model .",
    "the maser emission is generated in those planetary envelopes which have been impacted by the shock at a particular moment . in this model",
    "the masers are identified as icy planets rotating around young massive stars in the proto - planetary disk .",
    "the disk is shielded from ionizing radiation of the star by the ultra - compact h  ii region which rests inside the disk and absorbs all uv - photons , and by a cold dense dust core which absorbs visible and near - ir photons .",
    "the core reemits all the absorbed energy in the far - infrared .",
    "this emission may serve as a pump for the masers .",
    "the masers in star forming regions are found to be associated with protostars or young massive stars of zams types o and b. although more than 200 extrasolar planets were discovered around solar - type stars , little is known about existence of planets orbiting young massive stars .",
    "planets around a pulsar perhaps may serve as an indirect evidence of planets belonging to more massive stars ( wolszczan & frail 1992 ) .",
    "dusty disks with possible crystalline grains were discovered around two very massive stars in lmc ( kastner et al .",
    "2006 ) , at the distance between 120 and 2500  au from the stars .",
    "the kuiper belt - like structures composed of debris may exist around these stars , and formation of larger objects  planets  can not be excluded .",
    "a very strong magnetic field of 40  mg has been detected in several oh maser spots which have appeared during a flare of oh maser emission in 2000 , within 110  au from the ultra - compact h  ii region .",
    "the magnetic field probably originates in the exciting star where its intensity is about 500  g , or from the compression of interstellar gas by mhd shock , or in icy planetary bodies serving as nuclei for the maser spot emission .",
    "more frequent high angular resolution observations of future flares may help to distinguish between these models .",
