    "it is by now a well - established fact ( numerically ) that spin glass models with nearest neighbour interactions have a finite transition temperature in spatial dimension @xmath3 at zero magnetic field @xcite , moreover the predictions of broken replica theory are well in agreement with the numerical data @xcite .",
    "however the value of the lower critical dimension @xmath4 , i.e. the dimension above which there is a phase transition at strictly positive temperature , is still debated and there have been different predictions based on different approaches .",
    "the initial investigations , in the framework of the droplet approach , used the _ stiffness _ exponent @xmath5 to conclude that , at zero temperature , @xmath6 in @xmath3 and @xmath7 in @xmath8 , thus implying @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the absence of a transition in @xmath8 was confirmed also by direct numerical simulations @xcite , that strongly suggest that the lower critical dimension is greater than 2 .    a recent numerical study by boettcher @xcite reached the conclusion that @xmath10 by measuring the stiffness exponent in various dimensions and making a best fit for its dimensional dependence which gives @xmath11 for @xmath10 .",
    "an alternative approach has been put forward by franz , parisi , virasoro in @xcite . here to measure the stability of the low temperature spin - glass phase against thermal fluctuations , the energy cost associated to imposing a different value of the overlap along one spatial direction has been considered .",
    "remarkably @xcite founds , using an analytical computation based on a mean - field approximation , the same result of the stiffness approach , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "however the approach introduced in @xcite has not yet been tested on a finite - dimensional model .",
    "this is the aim of this work .",
    "we find numerical results compatible with the prediction @xmath10 , even though strong finite size effects prevent a final answer .",
    "we first recall the approach of @xcite .",
    "we consider _ two _ identical copies ( same disorder ) of a system constrained to have their mutual overlaps on the boundaries fixed to some preassigned values . more precisely , we take two systems with the parallelepiped geometry of fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "each system has a base area @xmath12 and height @xmath13 ; we denote by @xmath14 the coordinate along the longitudinal direction of length @xmath13 . the study of systems with different aspect ratio @xmath15 for determining the interface exponent has been used in the past @xcite .",
    "each of the two systems has free boundary conditions along the longitudinal direction and periodic boundary conditions along the transverse direction .",
    "however the two systems are coupled by the value of the overlap at their boundary planes .",
    "we compare the following two situations . in the first case , which we call @xmath16 coupling condition",
    ", we impose an overlap @xmath1 on both the left @xmath17 and the right @xmath18 boundary plane ; in the second case , called here the @xmath19 coupling condition , the overlap on the left boundary @xmath17 is equal to @xmath1 and the overlap on the right boundary @xmath18 is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the quantity that we will be interested in is the difference of free energies between the two cases @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the inverse critical temperature , @xmath22 denotes the average over the random couplings and @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( resp .",
    "@xmath26 ) the left ( resp .",
    "right ) boundary plane , @xmath27 the hamiltonian of the spin configuration @xmath28 .",
    "one can prove that @xmath29 is a positive quantity thanks to the fact that @xmath30 .",
    "( [ deltaf ] ) seems an appropriate definition of a domain wall in spin glass models , in full analogy with usual ferromagnetic systems where a positive domain wall is obtained by imposing different values of the magnetization along one spatial direction .    since free energies are not directly accessible through monte carlo methods @xcite , in our simulations we measured the differences of internal energies between the @xmath19 and @xmath16 case @xmath31 where @xmath32    we observe that at zero temperature @xmath33 .",
    "thus , at small enough temperatures , the positivity of @xmath34 follows from the positivity of @xmath29 by a continuity argument .",
    "however we remark that in our numerical simulations we found _ always _ positive energy differences at all temperatures .",
    "more precisely , for a random initial condition , the sign of @xmath35 fluctuates at the beginning of the monte carlo run and then it stabilizes to a positive sign .    for many models @xcite",
    "we observe that , below the critical temperature , the free energy cost , as a function of the transverse and longitudinal length , scales for large volumes as @xmath36 with @xmath37 independent from the dimension ( for @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "the scaling of the free energy cost defines a lower critical dimension @xmath4 in the usual way : for an assigned aspect ratio @xmath40 the free energy cost behaves as @xmath41 . from this expression",
    "we see that the lower critical dimension , the one above which @xmath29 increases with @xmath42 and below which it vanishes with @xmath42 , turns out to be @xmath43 .",
    "the mean - field computation of @xcite predicts @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 . in other words , below the critical temperature",
    ", the free energy cost divided by the volume @xmath46 turns out to be independent from @xmath42 and , for large @xmath42 , it scales as @xmath47 since the free energy difference and the internal energy difference scale with the same exponent below the critical temperature then we also have @xmath48    generally speaking , at the phase transition point one usually obtains by changing the boundary conditions that @xmath49 using widom s scaling one gets : @xmath50 in a given case there could be cancellations and @xmath29 at the critical point could go to zero with the volume if @xmath51 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown by an explicit computation that this does not happen , at least in the mean field case .",
    "we expect that @xmath52 is a smooth function of the dimension , so that @xmath51 in @xmath3 , would be surprising .",
    "in our simulations we have considered the above mentioned geometrical set - up for the case of the edwards - anderson hamiltonian with dichotomic ( @xmath53 ) symmetrically distributed random couplings . in particular , the implementation of the two systems coupled at their boundaries was obtained considering a parallelepiped with _ doubled size in the longitudinal direction_. denoting by @xmath54 the coordinate in the longitudinal direction of the doubled parallelepiped , the disorder variables are symmetric with respect to the central plane @xmath55 .",
    "the sub - systems in the half - volumes @xmath56 and @xmath57 interact in the following way ( see fig ( [ fig1 ] ) ) :    \\i ) to keep the overlap of the spins @xmath28 and @xmath58 on the old @xmath59 plane fixed to @xmath1 , the spins of the new doubled system are identified and they lie on the plane @xmath55 ;    \\ii ) to keep the overlap of the spins @xmath28 and @xmath58 on the old @xmath60 plane fixed to either @xmath61 , the spins of the new doubled system at position @xmath62 and @xmath63 are identified .",
    "the strength of the couplings among the spins inside those planes are reduced by a factor one - half ( in order to have un - biased interactions ) ; the couplings between nearest neighbors not lying inside those planes are flipped when going from the @xmath16 case to the @xmath19 .",
    "note that the effective longitudinal size of the total system is @xmath64 .",
    "the data that we are going to describe concern systems with sizes @xmath65 for the cubic lattice whereas @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the parallelepiped lattice ( see tab . 1 ) and with @xmath68 different values of the aspect ratio @xmath69 , ranging from @xmath70 up to @xmath71 .",
    "the computations have been performed implementing a multi - spin coding of the parallel tempering algorithm with 33 equally spaced temperatures ranging between 0.6 and 2.2 .",
    "we start from the analysis of a cubic lattice ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the data for the extensive internal energy difference as a function of temperature for different system sizes are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) . below the critical temperature @xmath73",
    "the data vary weakly with the linear lattice size @xmath42 .",
    "the theoretical prediction would have been @xmath74 .",
    "this suggested that there might be strong finite size effects on the energy interface cost for the small lattices we consider .",
    "this is confirmed by the analysis around the critical temperature which is displayed in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) . for the parallelepiped geometry",
    ", the extensive internal energy interface cost shows a different behavior when plotted versus the aspect ratio @xmath40 or against the `` corrected '' aspect ration @xmath75 ( see the panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) ) . even though these two characterizations of the aspect ratios are totally equivalent in the thermodynamic limit , the data show a marked difference in the two cases . to better appreciate this difference we show in the lower panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) the same data multiplied by @xmath76 on the left and @xmath77 on the right , where @xmath78 has been computed fitting to an exponential form the behavior of the data at large @xmath15 ( or @xmath79 , it gives the same @xmath80 ) .",
    "we do not claim an exponential dependence , we merely used the exponential re - scaling from the fit to make the data variation more visible .    to extract sensible information from our data , a careful analysis of the dependence of @xmath34 from @xmath42 and @xmath13",
    "is required .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) tell us that it is difficult to make an analysis of the data as a function of the aspect ratio @xcite .",
    "thus we start from the expected behavior of very large systems @xmath81 which is suggested by the general argument that each of the @xmath82 spins on each plane give the same contribution .",
    "thus , for the small finite systems we have , we study the dependence on @xmath83 for a fixed @xmath13 .",
    "since we want to study the behavior for systems with longitudinal size much smaller than transverse size , we must limit the analysis to small values of @xmath13 .    at critical temperature",
    "we expect the scaling of eq .",
    "( [ deltaeatc ] ) , i.e. @xmath84 figure ( [ fig4 ] ) shows that @xmath85 does not depend on @xmath42 for large @xmath42 values .",
    "this implies a value of @xmath86 to be compared to @xmath87 of @xcite .",
    "the predicted value of our exponent should be @xmath88 .",
    "we think that the difference between @xmath89 and the predicted value ( @xmath88 ) is not worrisome given the fact that the value of @xmath90 was computed in @xcite using lattices ( up to @xmath91 ) that are much larger of ours and , historically , previous determinations of @xmath92 on smaller lattices gave large values of @xmath92 .    below the critical temperature",
    "we expect the scaling of eq .",
    "( [ deltaesottotc ] ) , i.e. @xmath93 in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) we show @xmath94 versus @xmath83 .",
    "the behavior is described by a fit of the form @xmath95 .",
    "the slope @xmath96 is increasing with @xmath13 while the intercept @xmath97 is instead constant in @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) we show @xmath98 versus @xmath99 in log - log scale .",
    "the data nicely fall on a straight line with a constant slope @xmath100 .",
    "the best fit on @xmath96 gives @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 if @xmath104 while @xmath105 excluding the values @xmath106 .",
    "thus it would imply that the correction @xmath107 converges to zero for large volumes with an assigned aspect ratio .",
    "it would nice to study the scaling property of the interface energy as a function of both variables @xmath110 .",
    "in particular one would like to study the dependence when both @xmath42 and @xmath13 grow with a fixed aspect ratio . in fig .",
    "( [ fig7 ] ) we plot @xmath111 versus @xmath112 at temperature @xmath113 .",
    "we see that there is not a global clear scaling of the data .",
    "we tried also the aspect ratio scaling in the spirit of @xcite , according to which @xmath114 .",
    "we found very large oscillations in the exponent @xmath115 .",
    "we tried to cure the finite size effects by considering the scaling @xmath116 but we have too few points and the final errors have a too large error .",
    "one would need larger lattices and smaller errors on the data to reach a definite conclusion .    at this stage",
    "it is difficult to assign a precise error on @xmath37 because of the limited range of @xmath42 ( @xmath117 ) ; for such small lattices it would be mandatory to consider corrections to scaling and the fits would become unstable .",
