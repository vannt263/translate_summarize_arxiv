    "the lowest branch between m and k that connects the top of the flexural acoustic modes along @xmath3-m to the k point has a dispersion of only 0.3 mev , making the spectrum effectively one dimensional .",
    "in this situation , one can expect a much stronger van hove singularity @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) typical of the one dimensional case .",
