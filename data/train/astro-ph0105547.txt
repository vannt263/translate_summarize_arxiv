    "standard candles have discovered signs of a small positive cosmological constant in the hubble diagram @xcite .",
    "further evidence comes from investigations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background as well as large scale structure and the age of the universe ( for recent reviews and references see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    assuming standard cosmological theory @xcite these observations",
    "indicate that matter , including dark matter , contributes about 30% of the critical density and an effective cosmological constant or dark energy about 70% .",
    "these results indicate that our universe is close to being flat and has a big bang origin .",
    "furthermore , we are living at a time in cosmic history when the cosmological constant , or something that mimics its effects , is already dominating the expansion .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate the evolution of ever - expanding big bang world models with a cosmological constant , or a quintessence field , with particular emphasis on the evolution of the observable universe , _ i.e. _  our past light cone and relevant observables such as redshift of cosmic sources , their apparent magnitude and apparent size .",
    "the properties of the particle horizon , the hubble surface and the event horizon will also be discussed .",
    "we introduce a new concept , the @xmath0-sphere ( or @xmath1-sphere , in the case of quintessence ) , which is the surface in our visible universe that bounds the region where dark energy dominates the expansion , and within which the universe is accelerating .",
    "we track the evolution of this surface through cosmic history .",
    "our methods are in many ways similar to the ones used in our work on the evolution of closed world models without a cosmological constant @xcite in which an extensive list of references to earlier work on cosmic evolution can be found ( see also @xcite for a different perspective and further references ) .",
    "we emphasize that our approach is different from , but complementary to , most other recent investigations which concentrate on applying new and old cosmological tests , such as the @xmath8 relation , to the present light cone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in  [ frw ] by reviewing the basic definitions and results of standard cosmology that are relevant to our discusson . in  [ obs ]",
    "we discuss the light cone , the particle and event horizons as well as the hubble surface for a fundamental observer . in ",
    "[ evolution ] , [ changes ] and [ causal ] we present our results for the evolution of observable quantities such as redshift , apparent magnitude and apparent angular size and discuss the properties of the @xmath0-sphere as well as the question of causal connections .",
    "similar methods are then used in  [ quintessence ] to investigate the effects of quintessence and in  [ discussion ] we conclude the paper .",
    "the space - time metric of the standard spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) world models can be written in the form ( see e.g.   @xcite ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 are comoving spherical coordinates , @xmath12 is the cosmic proper time and @xmath13 is the velocity of light .",
    "@xmath14 is the universal scale factor and @xmath15 the curvature scalar which takes one of three possible values according to whether the universe is open ( @xmath16 ) , flat ( @xmath17 ) or closed ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the models is determined by the einstein field equations for a universe composed of a perfect fluid and by the equation of energy - momentum conservation .",
    "these equations can be reduced to a system of two differential equations in the form @xmath19 and @xmath20 here the dot means differentiation with respect to @xmath12 , @xmath21 is newton s constant of gravitation and the total mass - energy density , @xmath22 , and the total pressure , @xmath23 , are given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . above",

    "note that in order to solve equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) one also needs equations of state for matter , radiation and quintessence .",

    "that paper uses @xmath43 instead of @xmath44 as a pressure parameter , with @xmath45 ) .    in this paper",
    "we shall primarily be concerned with the effects of a cosmological constant on the evolution of the observable universe with emphasis on cosmic epochs in which matter dominates over radiation .",

    "note in particular that while @xmath70 covers the whole range from @xmath63 to @xmath89 , @xmath77 has a maximum value , which we denote by @xmath90 .",

    "[ eventhor ] . in",
    "what follows , in the main text as well as in figure captions , both @xmath77 and @xmath80 will be presented in units of @xmath87 .",
    "we now discuss in turn the light cone of a fundamental observer , his hubble sphere and his event horizon .",
    "the light cone of a fundamental observer is determined by @xmath91 , i.e.  by @xmath92 where we have used equation  ( [ cmetric ] ) .",
    "here @xmath93 corresponds to the future light cone and @xmath94 to the past light cone .    assuming that at time @xmath95 we receive a signal emitted at time @xmath77 from a source at @xmath80 , integration of ( [ dlcone ] ) gives the equation of our past light cone at @xmath95 as @xmath96 similarily our future light cone at @xmath95 is given by @xmath97 where @xmath77 is now the time in the future at which an observer at @xmath80 receives a signal emitted by us at @xmath95 . the future light cone at the big bang",

    "`` see '' these sources as they were at @xmath115 and with infinite redshift .    in our numerical calculations",
    "we assume a universe with ordinary matter and a cosmological constant ( or quintessence ) , i.e.  a universe with @xmath116 .",
    "this basically means that we ignore the expansion dynamics of the early universe . for our purposes",
    "this is a good approximation .",
    "however it should be kept in mind that the early universe probably went through an inflationary period . with inflation",
    "the real particle horizon is much further away than the particle horizon obtained by assuming a dust universe with a cosmological constant ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the particle horizon presented in our calculations is therefore approximately equal to the particle horizon looking back to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "this horizon is sometimes called the `` visual horizon '' @xcite . for our standard @xmath0-model",
    "we find that @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "`` the hubble surface '' ( hs ; @xcite ) is the instantaneous set of points which at time @xmath77 are moving away from us at the speed of light .",
    "their proper distance is given by the velocity - distance law as @xmath119 and hence the conformal distance is @xmath120 in terms of @xmath70 , the proper distance to the hubble surface is given by @xmath121 and it is moving away from us at speed @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the deceleration parameter . note that if the cosmological constant dominates the expansion then @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "for our standard @xmath0-model we find that @xmath126 and hence the present speed of the hubble surface is @xmath127 .    in figure  [ fig2 ]",

    "note that at a given time sources beyond the hubble surface are moving away from us with speed greater than @xmath13 , whereas sources inside the surface are receeding with speed less than @xmath13 . from the figure one can also see that on a cosmic timescale the hubble surface rapidly approaches the event horizon and within only a few hubble times after the big bang",
    "the two have practically merged , never to part again .",
    "if the world line of a source at conformal distance @xmath80 intersects our past light cone at time @xmath95 then we see it as it was at @xmath128 where @xmath129 now suppose that for an ever - expanding world model the integral @xmath130 is finite .",
    "then the conformal time @xmath131 corresponding to @xmath132 is finite and the conformal distance @xmath133 given by @xmath134 is the finite distance to our event horizon ( eh ) at time @xmath77 ( or @xmath70 ) .",
    "this is because the event horizon is our final or ultimate light cone @xcite .",
    "it is defined by equation  ( [ eventh ] ) and shown for our standard model by the solid curve in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "all events on the event horizon will first be `` seen '' by us at the end of time ( @xmath135 corresponding to @xmath101 ) and with infinite redshift ( see  [ evolution ] ) .",
    "events beyond this horizon will never be seen by us .",
    "the proper distance to the event horizon at time @xmath70 is given by @xmath136 and it is moving away from us with speed @xmath137 where @xmath138 is given by equation  ( [ vph ] ) . for our standard @xmath0-model",
    "we have that @xmath139 .    from figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we see that for the ever - expanding big bang models with a cosmological constant , the event horizon is stationary at a particular proper distance after a certain time .",
    "furthermore the hubble surface approaches the event horizon quite rapidly .",
    "for the standard @xmath0-model in figure  [ fig2 ] , we have that the proper distance to the hubble surface and the event horizon is fixed at @xmath140 at late cosmic epochs . for comparison with this ultimate value ,",
    "we remind the reader that the present day value of @xmath141 is @xmath142 , and from equation  ( [ deh ] ) we see that @xmath143 .",
    "the reason for this limiting behaviour can be understood in the following way . for an ever - expanding model the scale factor increases without limit .",
    "after a certain time , say @xmath144 , we see from equation  ( [ main ] ) that the @xmath0 term dominates completely and hence it is a good aproximation to write @xmath145 from this it follows that @xmath146 note that although the proper distance to the event horizon is finite , its luminosity distance , @xmath147 , is infinite .",
    "however , as will be discussed in more detail in  [ evolution ] , the angular diameter distance , @xmath148 , is finite .    for later purposes we also express equation  ( [ alambda ] ) in terms of conformal time . for @xmath77 in the range @xmath149 , where @xmath150 corresponds to @xmath144 , we find from equations  ( [ etatau ] ) and  ( [ alambda ] ) that @xmath151 and hence @xmath152    finally , we remind the reader that only universes with finite @xmath90 have event horizons . for example",
    "if the scale factor grows as a power of time , i.e.  @xmath153 , then @xmath90 is finite only if @xmath154 .",
    "models with scale factors growing more slowly than this have no event horizons , e.g.  the open or flat frw - universes with @xmath155 , and quintessence models with @xmath156 ( see also   [ quintessence ] ) .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the time evolution of various observational quantities in ever - expanding big bang models with a cosmological constant .",
    "consider first our past light cone . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show how it evolves with cosmic time in our standard @xmath0- model .",
    "as time advances for the observer , his light cone gets closer and closer to the event horizon , demonstrating that the event horizon corresponds to his final light cone .",
    "one can clearly see how his observable part of the universe is enclosed for all time within a finite proper volume with proper radius @xmath157 .",
    "as expected , figure  [ fig3]b also shows that the hubble surface ( the short dashed curve ) crosses the observer s light cones at their maximum proper distance from the time axis .",
    "the world lines of sources at several different conformal distances , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , are also shown in figure  [ fig3]b ( dotted curves ) .",
    "all sources taking part in the cosmic expansion leave our observable part of the universe in a finite proper time .",
    "however , just as an observer at rest far away from a black hole never sees infalling objects pass the event horizon of the black hole , we shall never see the sources pass through our cosmic event horizon , although they will rapidly fade away once the cosmological constant dominates the expansion .",
    "assume that a given cosmic source is located at comoving conformal distance @xmath80 .",
    "its redshift , @xmath160 , as observed at time @xmath161 is given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the time at emission , _",
    "i.e. _   the time at which the world line of the source crosses the observer s past light cone as it is at the time of observation .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we plot @xmath160 as a function of the time of observation for sources at various distances , @xmath80 . for simplification we have dropped the subscript @xmath164 on both @xmath77 and @xmath70 .",
    "we first `` see '' each source when it comes within our particle horizon , _",
    "i.e. _  as it was at the big bang ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "it therefore enters our observable universe with infinite redshift at cosmic time @xmath166 .",
    "before the cosmological constant becomes dynamically important the redshift decreases more or less as in a universe without @xmath0 because the expansion is slowing down . as the effects of the cosmological constant begin to manifest themselves , the source s redshift reaches a minimum , and",
    "once @xmath0 completely dominates the expansion ( i.e.  for @xmath167 or equivalently for @xmath168 ; see the discussion after eq .",
    "[ [ deh ] ] ) the behaviour of the source s redshift with time is given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "for @xmath172 we have that @xmath173 .",
    "hence all sources will redshift away on a timescale @xmath174 , the redshift going to infinity at @xmath135 corresponding to @xmath101 when the scale factor becomes infinite .    in order to investigate this in more detail",
    "we introduce a redshift evolutionary timescale , @xmath175^{-1}$ ] , which can be compared to the expansion timescale ( normalized hubble time ) , @xmath176^{-1}$ ] .",
    "note that @xmath177 can take both positive and negative values , depending on whether the redshift is increasing or decreasing . by use of equation  ( [ red ] )",
    "we find for the frw models in general that @xmath178\\;,\\ ] ] where the time derivative of @xmath69 is given by equation  ( [ main ] ) . also note that in deriving this result we have used cosmic time dilation : @xmath179 . in terms of the timescales ,",
    "equation  ( [ zder ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath180    next consider the right hand side of equation  ( [ timescales ] ) as a function of @xmath160 .",
    "it has a maximum at the redshift corresponding to a minimum value of @xmath177 . for big bang models with @xmath181 we have",
    "that @xmath182 is a decreasing function of @xmath70 , i.e.  @xmath183 , and thus @xmath184 is negative during expansion . in such models",
    "the redshift of a given source always decreases with time ( in recollapsing models the redshift eventually changes into blueshift , see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "however , for big bang models with a positive cosmological constant the situation is different . due to the dynamical effects of @xmath0 , accelerated expansion starts at cosmic time",
    "@xmath185 given by @xmath186 and continues forever .",
    "it is clear from the discussion above that at a given cosmic time , @xmath187 , the redshift corresponding to the epoch @xmath185 is also the redshift that minimizes @xmath177 and maximizes the change in redshift .",
    "this particular redshift , which we shall denote by @xmath188 , thus locates the surface on the past light cone which bounds the region where @xmath0 dominates the expansion and within which the universe is accelerating .",
    "we shall refer to this surface as the @xmath0-sphere . beyond the @xmath0-sphere the universe is still decelerating .",
    "we next determine the redshift @xmath188 . by use of equation  ( [ main ] )",
    "it is easy to show that equation  ( [ second ] ) is equivalent to the following algebraic equation for @xmath69 : @xmath189 where we have assumed that @xmath116 . in the case",
    "@xmath190 the solution is @xmath191 , where @xmath192 at any time @xmath187 the observed redshift , @xmath188 , of a source which emitted its light at @xmath185 is therefore given by @xmath193 in figure  [ fig4]b the relation @xmath194 is shown by the triple dot - dashed curve .",

    ", we find that @xmath196 , corresponding to time @xmath197 , and @xmath198 . hence , in this model , cosmic acceleration started @xmath199 gyrs ago .",
    "for @xmath200 this is @xmath201 gyrs , and hence the acceleration started well before the formation of the solar system .",
    "as time advances the @xmath0-sphere moves away from the observer and its conformal distance at time @xmath77 is given by @xmath202 where @xmath203 .",
    "hence the proper distance to the @xmath0-sphere is @xmath204 and it is moving away from the observer with speed @xmath205 for our standard @xmath0-model we have that @xmath206 and therefore @xmath207 .",

    "the evolution of the @xmath0-sphere is shown by the long dashed curve in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "note that this curve is the same as the observer s future light cone at time @xmath209 .",

    "hence the maximum effects of the cosmological constant on the change in redshift is given by @xmath257 .",
    "for @xmath258 years , say , @xmath241 at maximum is therefore only of the order of @xmath259 .",
    "this is a very small number and such minute changes in @xmath160 will probably not be observable in the near future ( see however @xcite for a detailed discussion of the observational situation ) .    in a similar way one can investigate changes in the apparent magnitude and the apparent angular size of a given source with present redshift @xmath160 . using equations  ( [ dmag ] ) and ( [ dphi ] ) we find to first order in @xmath260 : @xmath261 and @xmath262 with @xmath263 given by equation  ( [ deltaz ] ) .",
    "it is clear that figure  [ fig6 ] can be used to investgate the behaviour of both @xmath264 and @xmath265 as functions of @xmath160 for the selected values of @xmath71 and @xmath73 . from the results",
    "already obtained we find for our standard @xmath0-model that at @xmath188 the change in magnitude is @xmath266 over a period of 100 years . in a similar way the maximum relative changes in @xmath229 due to the accelerated expansion is @xmath267 over the same perod of time .",
    "such small changes will presumably not be observable in the near future .",
    "we conclude this section by emphasizing that although the prospects for actually measuring the changes in redshift , apparent brightness and apparent size of cosmological sources do not seem promising , it is of interest to investigate figure  [ fig6 ] with respect to the general effects of a cosmological constant at the present epoch .",
    "we see e.g.  that for distant sources with high @xmath160 ( _ i.e. _  @xmath268 ) , corresponding to emission at cosmic times before @xmath0 becomes dynamically dominant , their redshift is decreasing and their apparent brightness is also decreasing , but relatively slowly .",
    "however , for cosmological sources with @xmath216 the redshift is increasing due to the repulsive effects of @xmath0 , and the apparent brightness is decreasing relatively fast .",
    "thus the influence of @xmath0 is considerable outside the @xmath0-sphere , out to @xmath269 .",
    "this is in agreement with the time evolution of the observables discussed in ",
    "[ redbrightsize ] and [ brightsize ] and demonstrated in figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] .",
    "consider figure  [ fig7 ] . the future light cone ( dot - dashed curve ) at observing time @xmath77 crosses the event horizon ( solid curve ) at the event ( @xmath270 , @xmath271 ) .",
    "the world line of a source that passes through that event is also shown ( long dashed curve ) .",
    "we will not be able to receive any signal from that source sent later than @xmath271 .",
    "because of symmetry , the source can not receive any signal from us sent after @xmath271 .",
    "hence the source passes out of our sphere of influence at time @xmath271",
    ". however , our evolving past light cone ( shown as it is at the present epoch by the dotted curve ) crosses the source s world line right till the end at @xmath90 , at which time the source is seen as it was at @xmath271 but with infinite redshift . at time",
    "@xmath77 we see the source with redshift @xmath272 as it was at time @xmath273 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath274 and @xmath275 also @xmath276 and for this last equation to be valid we must have @xmath277 , since at earlier times the source is outside the particle horizon .",
    "it s redshift is given by @xmath278    next consider the source at @xmath279 in figure  [ fig7 ] ( dash - triple dotted curve ) that is crossing the event horizon at time @xmath77 . clearly @xmath280 and we see this source with redshift @xmath281 given by @xmath282 the light we see being emitted at time @xmath283 note that we must have @xmath284 for equation  ( [ em0 ] ) to be valid . at earlier times the source is outside the particle horizon .    for our standard world model shown in figure  [ fig7 ]",
    "we have that the present time of observation , @xmath77 , is equal to @xmath285 .",
    "also @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 ( we remind the reader that numerical values of all @xmath77 s and @xmath80 s are in units of @xmath87 ) .",
    "we also find that @xmath290 .",
    "this means , that the light being emitted now by sources having present redshift greater than @xmath291 , will not reach us until the sources have crossed our event horizon , at which time they are completely out of causal contact .",
    "in this model we also have @xmath292 , @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "hence all sources with present redshift greater than @xmath7 have already crossed our event horizon , and are thus completely out of causal contact with us ( see also @xcite and @xcite who reach similar conclusions ) . from this one can easily estimate the number of sources that are still within the event horizon as compared with the initial matter content .",
    "the number of sources is proportional to the comoving proper volume and hence the relative number of sources presently within the horizon is equal to @xmath295 .",
    "this means that more than 98% of all sources initially within our observable part of the universe have already crossed the event horizon .",
    "we can also estimate the portion of observable sources that we could have seen by now , at least in principle .",
    "it is simply given by @xmath296 .",
    "hence , we still have not seen 60% of the observable sources",
    ".    to summarize : in our standard @xmath0-model the event horizon will ultimatly be stationary at a proper distance of @xmath297 gpc ( note that this is also the ultimate angular diameter distance to the event horizon ) .",
    "we have already seen about 40% of the sources that are in principle observable , but about 98% of all cosmic sources originally within our observable part of the universe have already left .",
    "this includes all sources that we presently see and have redshift higher than @xmath7 .",
    "because of the finite speed of light we will eventually be able to see all the sources originally inside our event horizon , but only as they were in the past before crossing the horizon .",
    "once the cosmological constant dominates the expansion their redshift will , however , increase exponentially with time and they will fade away on a timescale measured in a few hubble times .",
    "of course this applies only to sources that are distant enough to participate in the cosmic expansion , _",
    "i.e. _  sources outside our local supercluster but originally within our event horizon .",
    "although by invoking einstein s cosmological constant it is easy to explain why the expansion of the universe is presently accelerating , there has recently been considerable discussion of the possibility that something else is causing the acceleration , mimicking the effects of a cosmological constant at the present epoch .",
    "the main reason for this is simply that theoretical particle physicists have so far been unable to explain why the cosmological constant has such a small nonzero value ( @xmath298 corresponding to @xmath299 ) , their most natural estimates giving values of @xmath300 corresponding to @xmath301 ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "several other possible causes for the cosmic acceleration have been discussed in the literature , including quintessence , frustrated network of topological defects , time - varying particle masses and effects from extra dimensions ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for further discussion and references ) .    in this paper we shall only investigate the effects of one of these alternatives .",
    "we choose the case of a slowly evolving scalar field ( or quintessence ; @xcite ) leading to an equation of state of the form @xmath302 where @xmath59 may or may not be a function of cosmic time .",
    "we assume as before that we are investigating epochs where radiation can be neglected ( @xmath116 ) and that the quintessence field is decoupled from matter .    in order to investigate the effects of quintessence on the evolution of the observable universe",
    "we shall furthermore assume that @xmath303 and that @xmath59 is a constant ( assuming a constant @xmath59 is not a serious restriction since our results can easily be extended to the time dependent case ) .",
    "it then follows from equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) that the mass - energy density of the quintessence component is given by @xmath304 realistic expanding models , with @xmath33 decreasing with time , thus require @xmath305 .",
    "the case corresponding to @xmath306 is of course equivalent to the cosmological constant case .",
    "equation  ( [ main ] ) now reduces to @xmath307 from which we see that for ever - expanding big bang models , the quintessence field will ultimately dominate the expansion if @xmath308 , and at late times the scale factor will grow with @xmath70 according to @xmath309 where @xmath310 this should be compared with the corresponding behaviour of @xmath69 at late times in a @xmath0-dominated universe ( eq .  [ [ alambda ] ] ) .",
    "examples demonstrating the difference are shown in figure  [ fig8 ] .    from the results above and the discussion at the end of   [ eventhor ]",
    "we see that only models with @xmath311 ( corresponding to @xmath154 ) have event horizons .",
    "the theoretically interesting range for @xmath59 is therefore @xmath312 ( corresponding to @xmath313 ) .",
    "this should be compared to observations , which seem to indicate that quintessence can only be viable at present if @xmath314 with the upper limit , @xmath315 , not greater than @xmath316 and probably lower ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of the observational situation ) .",
    "thus , if the cosmic acceleration is due to quintessential dark energy , the universe has event horizons just as in the case of a true cosmological constant ( see in this context @xcite and @xcite , who discuss the problems this poses for string theory ) .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that if for some reason @xmath59 changes in the future , so that it ultimately becomes larger than @xmath317 ( corresponding to @xmath318 ) then the event horizons disappear . also note that for a given @xmath74 the maximum conformal time , @xmath90 , tends to infinity as @xmath59 approaches @xmath319 from below .    in what follows",
    "we shall investigate in detail the evolution of the observable universe when quintessence is the single cause of cosmic acceleration .",
    "we use the same methods as above and compare the results to those of models with a positive cosmological constant .    in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we show the normalized scale factor @xmath69 as a function of time for @xmath2 , @xmath320 and two values of @xmath59 : @xmath321 ( dotted curve , marked @xmath1 ) and @xmath322 ( dash - dotted curve ) . in the following",
    "we shall refer to the model with @xmath323 as the @xmath1-model . for this model @xmath324 and @xmath325 .",
    "also shown for comparison are two other models : our standard @xmath0-model ( solid curve , marked @xmath0 ) , and a model , which we shall call the @xmath226-model , with @xmath2 and both @xmath326 and @xmath247 equal to zero ( dashed curve , marked @xmath226 ) .",
    "note that since @xmath311 for the quintessence models , they both have event horizons .    from figure  [ fig8 ] one",
    "sees how the expansion of quintessence models , with @xmath74 and @xmath71 both fixed , depends on @xmath59 . as @xmath59 takes decreasing values in the range from @xmath317 to @xmath327 , the corresponding curves change continuously from the @xmath226-curve to the @xmath0-curve .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the past and future light cones , the hubble surface , the particle horizon and the event horizon for our @xmath1-model , and should be compared to figure  [ fig2 ] for the standard @xmath0-model .",
    "applying the methods introduced in ",
    "[ obs ] to quintessence models in general it is easy to see that once quintessence completely dominates the expansion , the proper distance to the hubble surface is given by @xmath328 and that the proper distance to the event horizon is @xmath329 we emphasize that if @xmath330 there is no event horizon , and hence the last expression ( [ accqeh ] ) is only valid for models with @xmath311 .",
    "both @xmath141 and @xmath331 increase linearily with time , but since @xmath332 for all @xmath312 , the hubble surface is always considerably closer than the event horizon .",
    "this is in contrast to models with a cosmological constant where both distances quickly approach the same finite limit given by equation  ( [ hseh ] ) .    in order to investigate the evolution of the redshift , the apparent magnitude and the angular size of distant sources in a quintessential universe",
    "we pick a source at a typical conformal distance @xmath333 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig10 ] for the models of figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "note that at late times @xmath334 and @xmath335 hence @xmath37 is a linear function of @xmath336 .",
    "furthermore the minimum size of @xmath229 is given by equation  ( [ accphi ] ) as before .",
    "these results should be compared to the late time behaviour of @xmath160 , @xmath147 and @xmath37 in models with a cosmological constant , shown by equations  ( [ accz ] ) , ( [ bdl ] ) and ( [ bm ] ) and in figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .      in   [ redbrightsize ] we defined the @xmath0-sphere as the surface bounding the region in our visible universe where the expansion is accelerating due to the presence of the cosmological constant . for the quintessence models we similarly define a @xmath1-sphere as the surface in the visible universe bounding the accelerating region driven by the quintessence component .",
    "we denote the time when quintessence acceleration becomes dominant by @xmath337 and use equation  ( [ algebra ] ) with @xmath303 to find the value @xmath338 .",
    "it is given by @xmath339 as a result , at any time @xmath340 the observed redshift , @xmath341 , of a source which emitted its light at @xmath337 is given by @xmath342    in the same way as in the previous section we find from equations  ( [ zder ] ) and ( [ timescales ] ) that in a universe dominated by quintessence , @xmath210 is zero , and @xmath211 , when @xmath212 .",

    "this equation can easily be solved numerically , and figure  [ fig11 ] shows @xmath345 at the present epoch , together with @xmath341 and @xmath337 , as functions of @xmath59 for models with @xmath2 and @xmath320 .",
    "in general , as @xmath59 approaches @xmath327 , the redshift @xmath345 approaches the value @xmath213 for the @xmath0-model ( eq .  [ [ zzero ] ] with @xmath74 instead of @xmath247 ) . in the same way @xmath341 and @xmath337 approach @xmath188 and @xmath185 respectively .",
    "for the special case @xmath346 equation  ( [ zqzero ] ) has a simple solution : @xmath347 .",
    "note that since @xmath348 , equations  ( [ qmin ] ) and ( [ zqzero ] ) have physical solutions only if @xmath349 .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] also shows that if @xmath59 is less than @xmath350 , then @xmath341 and @xmath337 vary slowly with changing @xmath59 , indicating that at the present epoch numerical values of observables are not very sensitive to @xmath59 in the range @xmath351 .",
    "the same thing can be inferred from figures  [ fig8 ] and  [ fig10 ] .",
    "this is similar to the corresponding results of @xcite for frw - models without a cosmological constant , which show that for models with the same value of @xmath352 the classical cosmological tests are degenerate at low redshifts with respect to different values of the pressure parameter @xmath44 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eos ] ] ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to go to high redshifts in order to distinguish between the various models ( see also  @xcite ) .    continuing with the general approach already introduced for models with a cosmological constant",

    "finally , let us investigate the extent of the observable universe in the @xmath1-model as well as the question of causal connections .",
    "we use the same terminology and notation as in   [ causal ] so the results can easily be compared to the corresponding results for the @xmath0-model . in the @xmath1-model with @xmath2 , @xmath320 and @xmath360",

    "this particular value is much larger than the highest measured redshift at the present time .    in this model",
    "we also have that @xmath366 which is further away than the particle horizon at @xmath367 . hence",
    ", none of the sources that we can observe at the present epoch have yet crossed our event horizon . as a result",
    "we presently have causal contact with all of them .",
    "the relative number of sources presently within the event horizon is equal to @xmath368 .",
    "this means that in this model 77% of all sources initially within our observable part of the universe have already crossed the event horizon .",
    "so far we have not seen any of these departed sources but they will appear in our sky in the future and show themselves as they were in a younger universe .",
    "the portion of the observable sources that we could already have seen in principle is given by @xmath369 .",

    "93% of the observable sources .    it should be emphazised that we use this @xmath1-model only as a pedagogical example in order to show the effects of @xmath59 on the various numerical results .",
    "the astronomical observations indicate that the high value of @xmath59 corresponding to this model may not be realistic , and that a value closer to the @xmath0-value of @xmath327 is more likely to be correct .",
    "one should also keep in mind that observational results are not very sensitive to the value of @xmath59 , if @xmath370 .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the evolution of ever - expanding big bang universes which undergo acceleration , either due to a cosmological constant , @xmath0 , or a quintessence field , @xmath1 . in particular we have investigated the evolution of our observable part of the universe with emphasis on the evolution of our past light cone , the hubble sphere and the particle and event horizons . the @xmath0-sphere ( or @xmath1-sphere , in the case of quintessence ) , which is the surface bounding the region in our visible universe where cosmic acceleration dominates ,",
    "has also been investigated in detail .",
    "we have traced observables such as redshift , apparent magnitude and apparent angular size of distant sources through cosmic history , and shown in considerable detail how their images change and fade once the cosmic expansion is accelerating .",
    "taking at face value recent observations which indicate that @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath371 we find that the universe is presently about @xmath372 gyrs old , and that cosmic acceleration started @xmath201 gyrs ago , well before the formation of the solar system .",
    "the @xmath0-sphere is presently at a redshift of @xmath4 , and the redshifts of sources out to a redshift of @xmath373 are increasing with time due to the influence of @xmath0 . further out on the light cone",
    "the redshift is decreasing as in a universe without a cosmological constant . within a few hubble times",
    "the event horizon will be stationary at a fixed proper distance of @xmath5 gpc .",
    "this distance limits the extent of our observable universe for all time .",
    "cosmic sources with redshifts in the range @xmath291 to @xmath7 are now emitting light that will not reach us until these sources have crossed our event horizon . at that time",
    "they will be completely out of causal contact with us .",
    "all sources with redshift larger than @xmath7 have already crossed the event horizon and are thus out of causal contact .",
    "about 98% of all sources originally within our observable part of the universe have by now crossed the event horizon .",
    "because of the finite speed of light we still `` see '' a large portion of these sources ( about 40% , the ones inside our particle horizon ) and will eventually be able to see them all .",
    "they will appear as they were in the distant past before crossing the event horizon . because of redshift effects , all these sources will , however , fade away and disappear from view on a timescale measured in a few hubble times .",
    "the quintessence models become equivalent to a model with a cosmological constant in the limit when @xmath59 tends to @xmath327 , and all quintessence models with @xmath59 in the range @xmath374 have event horizons . for",
    "@xmath59 less than about @xmath322 the numerical values of various observables at the present epoch do not depend critically on @xmath59 , and are very similar to the values for @xmath306 .",
    "hence there is an observational degeneracy with respect to @xmath59 in that range .",
    "returning to the standard @xmath0-model it is clear that the future evolution of the observable universe is rather bleak from the human point of view .",
    "the receding galaxies will approach the cosmic event horizon on a timescale measured in a few hubble times .",
    "observers will not see the event horizon as such , but as galaxies approach it , their apparent motion slows down because of time dilation , and finally they will appear to be hovering at the horizon .",
    "this is why the apparent angular size of galaxies tends to a finite value at infinite time .",
    "because of the exponentially increasing redshift , the apparent luminosity of the galaxies decreases on a timescale of a few hubble times , making them disappear from view .",
    "if observers had instruments sensitive enough so that they could follow the galaxies for all time , they would eventually see all the matter originally within the observable universe forming a membrane at the event horizon .",
    "this is analogous to what an observer , stationed far away from a black hole , would see if he was watching luminous matter falling into the black hole .    from this discussion",
    "it is clear that in @xmath0-models ( and also in quintessence models , as long as @xmath312 ) any fundamental observer ( more precisely his local supercluster ) will be left alone in his observable universe within a few hubble times after the big bang .",
    "this rather dismal prospect raises interesting questions about the future evolution of life in the universe and cosmic communication .",
    "we shall not tackle such questions here but instead refer the reader to the papers by @xcite and @xcite which discuss the fate of life in an accelerating universe .",
    "finally we mention that if the expansion is dominated by a cosmological constant one expects that eventually there will be upward quantum fluctuations making bubbles of high density vacuum which consequently undergo inflation  @xcite .",
    "also , if for some reason the cosmological constant ( or the quintessence field ) were to decay , the future evolution of the observable universe would be different from the scenario presented here ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of various possibilities ) .",

    "<S> we consider ever - expanding big bang models with a cosmological constant , @xmath0 , and investigate in detail the evolution of the observable part of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss quintessence models from the same point of view .    a new concept , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-sphere ( or @xmath1-sphere , in the case of quintessence ) is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> this is the surface in our visible universe which bounds the region where dark energy dominates the expansion , and within which the universe is accelerating . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the evolution of this surface as the universe expands , and we also investigate the evolution of the particle and event horizons as well as the hubble surface . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the extent of the observable universe and the portion of it that can be seen at different epochs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we trace the changes in redshift , apparent magnitude and apparent size of distant sources through cosmic history . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is different from , but complementary to , most other contemporary investigations , which concentrate on the past light cone at the present epoch .    when presenting numerical results we use the frw world model with @xmath2 and @xmath3 as our standard cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> in this model the @xmath0-sphere is at a redshift of @xmath4 , and within a few hubble times the event horizon will be stationary at a fixed proper distance of @xmath5 gpc ( assuming @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all cosmological sources with present redshift larger than @xmath7 have by now crossed the event horizon and are therefore completely out of causal contact . </S>"
