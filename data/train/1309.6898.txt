    "a transmission line is described by its line parameters @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the series resistance per unit length of line ( including both wires ) , @xmath2 is the series inductance per unit length of line , @xmath3 is the capacitance between the two conducing wires per unit length of line and @xmath4 is the shunt leakage conductance between the two conducing wires per unit length of line . for an incremental length @xmath5 of the line ,",
    "the equivalent circuit is shown in fig",
    "the increments in voltage and current along the line are @xcite , @xmath6 these could be written in limit @xmath7 as , @xmath8 from ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) one gets a general solution for voltage along the line , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the propagation constant .",
    "the phasor part is written with an assumed @xmath11 time dependence throughout .",
    "now of the two terms in ( [ 25 ] ) , the first one represents a wave travelling along increasing @xmath12 commencing at @xmath13 , while the second represents a wave travelling towards decreasing @xmath12 which in case of an infinite line would have to start from @xmath14 an infinite time back and thus must be dropped .",
    "therefore the voltage along an infinite transmission line can be written as , @xmath15 from this one gets for the electric current , @xmath16 here @xmath17 , the characteristic impedance of the line given by , @xmath18 equations ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) represent an attenuated sinusoidal wave along @xmath12 , with @xmath19 as the attenuation constant and @xmath20 as the wave number .    for an infinite line , the input impedance ( at @xmath13 ) is calculated from ( [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] ) as , @xmath21    in a lossless line , r = 0 and g = 0 , we have @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. , a sinusoidal wave without any attenuation along the line .",
    "but we also have @xmath24 , i.e. , its impedance has a _ real _ value .",
    "this is a paradox because though the transmission line contains no resistive element so there could be no ohmic losses in the line , yet its input impedance is a pure resistance .",
    "that means for an input voltage @xmath25 , power will be drained from the source at the rate of v@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the questions therefore arise as to why does a pure resistance show up in a circuit comprising only reactances and where does this energy go ?",
    "the paradox can be also seen from the smith chart where the input impedance of a lossless open - circuit line , goes through cycles when its length is varied .",
    "not only does the input impedance not converge to a single unique value when the length of the line is increased indefinitely but also in general it is an _ imaginary _",
    "value , i.e. , a pure reactance ( @xcite ) for any length of the line , which contradicts the conclusion that the infinite line presents a _ real _ input impedance .",
    "now a transmission line with distributed parameters is almost identical in behaviour to a ladder network comprising lumped parameters @xcite , and the above paradox exists in the infinite ladder network also . a ladder network of @xmath27 blocks",
    ", with each block a symmetrical @xmath28 section consisting of two @xmath29 inductances and a capacitance @xmath3 , has a characteristic impedance @xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath27 of blocks could be a finite value , or it could even be infinite ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows an infinite ladder network while figure 2(b ) shows a finite ladder network , but terminated in its characteristic impedance @xmath30 ) .",
    "a solution for the input impedance @xmath32 of the infinite network is obtained in the following manner @xcite . since adding another block to the beginning of an infinite ladder network does not change the input impedance ( it still remains the same infinite network ) , @xmath32 must equal the impedance of a circuit having a single block terminated in a load impedance equal to @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we have , @xmath33 which has a solution , @xmath34 the input impedance of the infinite network equals its characteristic impedance , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "now for @xmath36 , @xmath32 is a _ real _ value .",
    "this leads to the same paradox as for the infinite transmission line of distributed parameters  how come a circuit containing only purely imaginary impedances has for its input impedance a _",
    "real _ value which could absorb energy continuously ? and where does this energy go as it could not be dissipated in the inductors and capacitors of the circuit ?",
    "for this feynman @xcite writes `` but how can the circuit continuously absorb energy , as a resistance does , if it is made only of inductances and capacitances ? _ answer _ : because there is an infinite number of inductances and capacitances , so that when a source is connected to the circuit , it supplies energy to the first inductance and capacitance , then to the second , to the third , and so on . in a circuit of this kind , energy is continually absorbed from the generator at a constant rate and flows constantly out into the network , supplying energy which is stored in the inductances and capacitances down the line . ''",
    "but there seems to be a catch here too .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the input impedance in an open - circuit ladder network , consisting of blocks comprising inductors and capacitors , does not converge to a unique fixed value when additional identical blocks are added . for all driving frequencies",
    "it seems to yield only imaginary ( reactive ) input impedance values , even when the number of blocks is increased to infinity .",
    "this contradicts feynman s observation @xcite above that the infinite ladder work has an input impedance which is pure resistance for @xmath37 .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that a non - zero real part of impedance appears only if there is a termination in an impedance that has a real part and that a circuit consisting solely of components with purely imaginary impedances has a purely imaginary input impedance .",
    "later the behaviour of infinite ladder network , its convergence and solutions have been analyzed much more thoroughly @xcite .    actually while writing ( [ 10 ] ) for @xmath32",
    "one implicitly assumed that the infinite series _ converges _ to a unique value and it is only under this existence supposition that a unique solution ( [ 11 ] ) could be obtained .",
    "if the series does not converge , then of course this basic assumption itself breaks down and the solution obtained thereby may not represent a true value .",
    "it seems that the infinite ladder networks of type in fig 2(a ) may have different answers for the input impedance , and thereby implying different power consumptions depending upon the method of solution .",
    "hence a paradox exists as one gets different results with different arguments , and a question still remains whether or not does an infinite ladder network converge to a pure resistance drawing continuous power from an input source , and if so where does this energy go",
    ". what could be the missing factor , if any , in these arguments ?",
    "could the two different modes of thinking be reconciled if this energy were lost into the surrounding medium by the process of radiation , with @xmath38 as the radiation resistance ? in transmission line or ladder network containing resistive elements , power loss by the source is fully accounted for by the energy dissipation in the circuit , for any value of @xmath1 and @xmath4 . consider the lossy infinite line ( i.e. , with @xmath1 and @xmath4 non - zero ) , where input power from the source is @xcite , @xmath39 \\cos ( \\angle{z_0 } ) = [ v{^2_0}/(2|z_0|^2)]re(z_0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand the power dissipated in an infinitesimal line element ( fig .",
    "1 ) is @xcite , @xmath40e^{-2\\alpha z}{\\rm d}z\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence the total power dissipated in the infinite line is @xmath41 \\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-2\\alpha z } { \\rm d}z\\\\ \\label{28a } = ( v^2_0/2)\\left[\\left(r/|z_0|^2\\right)+g\\right]/\\left(2\\alpha\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substitution for @xmath42 and @xmath19 shows that @xmath43 @xcite , and all power losses are accounted for without anything going into radiation .",
    "this is true for all @xmath1 and @xmath4 , in particular even when in limit @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "now it can not happen that when @xmath46 and @xmath47 radiation suddenly shows up into picture from somewhere .",
    "further , even in a lossless line , all the power ( assumed to be lost by the source ) can be consumed by terminating the line in its characteristic impedance , at whatever stage irrespective of the length of the line up to that point .",
    "this implies that up to any _ arbitrarily selected length _ of the line , the radiation losses had not taken place .",
    "therefore for resolving this paradox there does not seem any scope for radiation hypothesis at all and a satisfactory resolution of the paradox lies elsewhere .",
    "the solution of the paradox lies in the realization that there is an absence of a reflected wave in an infinite transmission line or infinite ladder network .      in a finite open - circuit network ( and",
    "thereby one not terminated in its characteristic impedance @xmath30 ) , there is a reflected wave from its terminated end as it has to match the conditions for a zero net current ( implying the electric current out of phase by angle @xmath48 for the incident and the reflected waves ) but the voltage being in phase there , at the reflection ( termination ) point . when we analyze a _",
    "finite _ network , the voltages and currents being considered are the superposition of incident and reflected waves . therefore the calculated @xmath32 may depend upon the length of the line or equivalently the number of blocks in the network as that would determine the relative phases of the incident and reflected waves at the input point aa in fig .",
    "2 .    now for frequencies below a critical value @xmath49 , the characteristic impedance can be written as @xmath50 , which is a _",
    "real _ quantity , meaning a pure resistance .",
    "let us consider the propagation factor @xmath51 between adjacent blocks calculated @xcite by terminating the ladder network in @xmath17 .",
    "this ensures that there is no reflected wave and one is dealing only with the incident wave . in the low frequency ( @xmath37 )",
    "case one gets @xcite , @xmath52 simplifying ( [ 12 ] ) we can write , @xmath53 a prime ( @xmath54 ) over voltages and currents is to indicate that these represent an incident wave . from the real and imaginary parts in ( [ 13 ] ) , it can be readily seen that the propagation factor has a unit magnitude and represents a simple phase change @xmath55 , between successive blocks in the network .    for calculating the propagation factor of the circuit",
    "we need to isolate the _ incident wave _ by terminating this network with its characteristic impedance @xmath17 .",
    "however the propagation properties of the incident wave , that is , the propagation constant to be calculated from ( [ 13 ] ) of _ incident _ wave between two neighbouring blocks ( say , @xmath56 and @xmath27 ) does not depend upon this termination .",
    "the incident wave has an input impedance every where equal to the characteristic impedance @xmath17 of the network . by terminating the circuit in its characteristic impedance",
    "we are only ensuring the absence of the reflected wave in the circuit .",
    "of course the voltages and currents at any point are decided by the superposition of the incident and reflected waves at that point .",
    "when the input impedance of a network is calculated as in @xcite , what one gets as the solution is for the superposition of the incident and the reflected wave with their phases duly taken into account . to prove our assertion",
    "this indeed is the case in general , we want to calculate input impedance of an open - circuit line , made of any finite number of blocks ( say , @xmath27 ) , by evaluating voltage and current at @xmath13 due to the sum of the incident and reflected waves , the latter arising from the termination just after the @xmath27th block .",
    "reflection plays a role in resolving the paradox was briefly mentioned in @xcite but without much further elaboration , which we do here much more explicitly , by calculating input impedance of a finite ladder network case by a superposition of incident and reflected waves . for a cascaded network of @xmath27 identical blocks ,",
    "the propagation factor is simply @xmath57 .",
    "the angle @xmath58 here is half of @xmath59 in ( 21 ) of @xcite .",
    "if the network has a total of @xmath27 blocks , then voltage @xmath25 at @xmath13 includes a reflected wave with a phase change of angle @xmath60 from the incident wave , while the current @xmath61 has a phase change of angle @xmath62 ( an extra phase of angle @xmath48 in the current wave at the refection point ) .",
    "therefore the input impedance is given by , @xmath63 we see that the calculated input impedance is the same what was calculated in an alternative method for a finite open - circuit ladder network @xcite , which thus proves our assertion that the propagation factor of the incident wave is unaffected by the termination impedance . as @xmath27",
    "is increased , @xmath32 is always of an _ imaginary _ value which goes through cycles , even becoming @xmath64 or @xmath65 , and in general does not converge to a unique value even when @xmath31 .    the propagation factor @xmath51 between adjacent blocks , for a high frequency ( @xmath66 ) case can be written as , @xmath67 from ( [ 21 ] ) it can be seen that for @xmath66 the propagation factor , written as @xmath68 , is of magnitude less than unity and is always of a negative value , implying a phase change of angle @xmath48 between successive blocks accompanied by an exponential decrease in amplitude .",
    "the voltages and currents do not penetrate too far in the circuit , and there is no continuous transport of energy along @xmath12 .",
    "the input impedance at frequencies @xmath66 for a cascade network of @xmath27 blocks is , @xmath69 which is imaginary , in spite of @xmath70 being always a real value , because the characteristic impedance @xmath71 is imaginary for @xmath66 . for @xmath72 , @xmath73 , a pure reactance , thus there is no paradox for the @xmath66 case , and we do not pursue it any further .    with sinusoidal excitation , when the voltage source supplies energy to any lc network , the current drawn must be @xmath74 out of phase with the voltage , so that there is no power being absorbed from the source .",
    "it is interesting that a standing wave in even a stand  alone",
    "lc circuit driven at a frequency @xmath75 , can be treated as a superposition of an incident and a reflected wave , and the input impedance @xmath76 can be calculated from that ( see appendix a ) . thus even in a driven lc circuit , which is the simplest special case of a ladder network , it is the reflected wave that brings the electric power back to the source resulting in zero net power loss from the source .",
    "no radiation losses are involved here .",
    "suppose these were there , and some energy has been radiated up to some block @xmath77 , and then the circuit continues up to a block @xmath27 ( @xmath78 ) and the circuit is open just after the @xmath27th block , then all the electric power is reflected at the termination which could not have occurred if part of the energy had already been radiated . or if just after element @xmath27 there is a matched resistive load , then all the power supplied from the generator will appear as ohmic losses in the load which could not have happened if energy had been already been partially lost as radiation .",
    "here @xmath77 and @xmath27 could be chosen arbitrarily large .",
    "thus radiation could not provide a resolution to the paradox .",
    "the characteristic impedance of a ladder network in case of a lossless ideal transmission line with distributed parameters ( fig .",
    "1 ) could be written as @xmath79 which reduces to @xmath80 as in limit @xmath81 .",
    "therefore unlike the ladder network case , in the transmission line case there is no cutoff frequency and for _ all _ driving frequencies a wave travels along the line without any amplitude attenuation since propagation constant has an _ imaginary _ value implying only a phase change .    in general",
    "the input impedance of a line of length @xmath82 is given by @xcite , @xmath83 where @xmath84reflected voltage at load / incident voltage at load ) is the reflection coefficient , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the impedance at the receiving ( load ) end .",
    "the input impedance reduces to @xmath17 when there is no reflected wave , i.e. , when @xmath87 . now",
    "the absence of a reflected wave can be due to three reasons .",
    "first , the line is finite but terminates in a load matched to the the characteristic impedance of the line , i.e. , when @xmath88 .",
    "second , the line has small resistance which can causes the incident voltage to die over its long length @xmath82 , i.e. , if @xmath89 , so that the amplitude of the incident and thence of the reflected wave is zero , then the series does converge to a unique solution @xcite which is consistent with @xmath35 .",
    "thirdly the line is lossless but truly of infinite extent so that it could be assumed that the incident wave , which assumedly started a finite time back , has not yet reached the termination point to start a reflected wave . in all three cases ,",
    "the input impedance , which is the ratio of the voltage and current at the input point , is the same as that is not affected by what happens at its termination point , and we obtain the same result for the input impedance , viz .",
    "@xmath35 .    on the other hand , for an open - circuit line of finite length @xmath82 ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) , the input impedance is given by",
    ", @xmath92 now in a lossless line , @xmath93 , then the input impedance becomes , @xmath94 which is a pure reactance , and thereby no net power consumed , and which is similar to the result derived for the ladder network ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that in case of a ladder network , the quantities @xmath95 , or even @xmath96 etc . are specified as per block of the circuit while in the case of a transmission line with distributed parameters all such quantities are defined per unit length of the line .",
    "therefore in ( [ 14 ] ) it is the phase angle change @xmath97 over @xmath27 blocks while in ( [ 20 ] ) it is the phase angle change @xmath98 over length @xmath82 of the line .",
    "in fact with increasing @xmath82 , @xmath99 from ( [ 20 ] ) is cyclic and is indeed the value read from the smith chart .",
    "one thing that we notice from ( [ 20 ] ) is that the input impedance @xmath32 depends on the length @xmath82 of the line in terms of wavelength @xmath100 . thus depending upon @xmath101",
    ", @xmath32 could be zero , a finite value or even infinity , but always a pure _ imaginary _ value , with a zero _ real _ part similar to what was seen for the ladder network in iii@xmath102 .",
    "here as much amount of power is reflected back to the generator as much it supplies in the incident wave .    in the case where there is only an incident wave , i.e.",
    ", there is no reflected wave , the current is in fact in phase with the voltage , implying power is being drawn from the source .",
    "however , if there is a reflected wave as well , then the voltage and current are not in phase everywhere .",
    "thus it is the absence of reflected wave in infinite transmission line that results in a continuous positive energy flux along the line .",
    "the relative phases of @xmath103 and @xmath104 depend upon the reflected wave , which in turn depends upon at how far point the reflection took place .",
    "of course no reflection will ever take place in a uniform infinite line as the incident wave will never reach the termination point which is at infinity .",
    "however if we consider the lossless case when there is a reflected wave from an open - circuit termination , then equal power is being returned to the source by the reflected wave and in that case the current is indeed @xmath74 out of phase with the voltage ( [ 14],[20 ] ) .",
    "if we take a transmission line without any discontinuity then it will have to be an infinite line and the energy will be getting stored in its elements further and further along the line as electric and magnetic fields .",
    "there is no violation of the energy conservation , and when there is no reflected wave to restore the energy to the source , it may be continuously giving away energy , which gets stored in electric and magnetic fields in more and more inductances and capacitances further away along the line .",
    "seen this way there does not appear to be any paradox .",
    "the paradox actually had arisen only because we were comparing two sets of solutions which are for quite different situations .",
    "one involves only an incident wave ( i.e. , without any reflected wave ) and then the input impedance @xmath35 is a _",
    "real _ quantity , and the voltages and currents are in phase everywhere along the circuit , with energy getting apparently `` spent '' as it is getting stored in the inductors and capacitors down the line as the incident keeps on advancing for ever in an infinite transmission line .",
    "the other solution was for the case with a reflected wave , and there the superposition of the incident and reflected waves results in @xmath32 to have _ imaginary _ value with no _ net _ power loss since the source gets the energy back as the reflected wave .",
    "it was shown that while an open - circuit finite ladder network or a transmission line with distributed network has a characteristic impedance @xmath105 which is only reactive ( imaginary ) , an infinite ladder network or an infinite transmission line has a finite _ real _ component of the input impedance .",
    "it was shown that the famous paradox of power loss in a lossless infinite transmission line is successfully resolved when one takes into account both the incident and reflected waves .",
    "the solution of the paradox lies in the realization that there is an absence of a reflected wave in an infinite transmission line . in a finite transmission line or ladder network ,",
    "the source still keeps on supplying power as an incident wave but gets it equally back in terms of the reflected wave .    therefore there is no further net power transfer from the source which is consistent with the reactive elements presenting zero net resistance .",
    "however in the case of an infinite ladder network or an infinite transmission line there is no discontinuity to start a reflected wave , thus the source supplies power in a forward direction , but does not get it back in terms of a reflected wave from the termination point . therefore there is an apparent net power loss , which actually appears as stored energy in its reactive elements ( capacitances and inductances ) further down the line .",
    "it was also shown that radiation plays absolutely no role in resolving this paradox .",
    "here we explicitly demonstrate that a driven lc circuit can be treated as an open - circuit 1-block ladder network having incident and reflected waves and from their superposition , the voltages and currents , and in particular , input impedance of the lc circuit can be calculated for all driving frequencies .",
    "we denote by @xmath106 and @xmath107 the voltages and currents at the input ( aa ) and termination ( bb ) respectively , and which ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) are related by @xmath108 , @xmath109 , where @xmath75 is the frequency at which the circuit is being driven by , say , a generator at the input end aa .",
    "the input impedance @xmath110 is given by , @xmath111 denoting voltages and currents for the incident and reflected waves by @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively , the boundary conditions at open end bb in fig . ( 3a ) imply @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the minus sign arising because the reflected current is out of phase with the incident wave by an angle @xmath48 , so as to make the net current @xmath116 . however to evaluate @xmath117 , we need to isolate the incident wave and which can be done by terminating the circuit in its characteristic impedance @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "the propagation factor for the incident wave from ( [ 13.1 ] ) is , @xmath118 with @xmath119 . as demonstrated in iii@xmath102 ,",
    "incident wave is not attenuated , irrespective of the termination impedance .",
    "the only difference is that there is also a reflected wave in the open circuit case ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , while there is no reflected wave when the circuit is terminated in its characteristic impedance @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) .    for the reflected wave in fig .",
    "3(a ) one can write the propagation factor as , @xmath120 equation ( [ 31 ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath121    from ( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 31a ] ) we get for the voltage @xmath25 and current @xmath61 as the superposition of the incident and reflected waves , @xmath122 therefore we get the input impedance @xmath32 as , @xmath123 using @xmath124 , we get @xmath125 , which of course is the expected result ( [ 30 ] ) .",
    "the input impedance is _ imaginary _ for all driving frequencies .",
