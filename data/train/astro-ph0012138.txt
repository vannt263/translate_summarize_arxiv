    "whether a fluid is stably stratified or unstable to convective overturn plays a crucial role in its dynamics and transport properties .",
    "this is particularly true in non - degenerate stars , where heat may be transported by convection or by radiation , and which of the two mechanisms is effective determines the shape of the temperature profile , and with it much of the structure of the star ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of neutron stars ,",
    "this issue had been largely ignored until it was pointed out that the transport of magnetic flux could be strongly affected if the matter was stably stratified ( @xcite ) .",
    "simple models for the composition and equation of state of equilibrium neutron star matter generally show that it is stably stratified due to the presence of a chemical gradient , and give more or less consistent estimates for the characteristic ( brunt - visl ) frequency ( @xcite ) .",
    "stable stratification leads to a set of g - modes ( @xcite ) which might be excited during binary inspiral ( @xcite ) .",
    "it also may affect angular momentum transport by inhibiting ekman circulation ( @xcite ) , with possible observational signatures in pulsar glitches ( @xcite ) .",
    "its effects on magnetic flux evolution have also gained relevance with the interpretation of soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars as ultramagnetized neutron stars powered by magnetic field decay ( @xcite ) .",
    "the recent work on r - modes destabilized by gravitational wave emission in very rapidly rotating neutron stars ( @xcite ) is also paying increasing attention to the effects of stable stratification and the relation between the modes of stratified and unstratified stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the previous work has made it plausible that cold neutron star matter is always stably stratified , but it has only considered specific models for neutron star matter , which are still quite uncertain ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper shows by a simple thermodynamic argument that an isentropic , multi - component fluid in full chemical equilibrium can not be unstable to convection .",
    "since cold neutron stars are zero - entropy objects , this proves the point above , except for the remaining , but unlikely possibility of marginal stability ( discussed below ) .    in the next section",
    ", the stage is set by a heuristic derivation of the general condition for stable stratification , given previously by other authors , but now phrased in the language and notation to be used in the rest of this work .",
    "section 3 contains the thermodynamic proof that is the core of the present paper",
    ". implications of this result are discussed in the final section .",
    "the stability condition for a static fluid in a gravitational field @xmath0 can be obtained by the following heuristic argument ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ( newtonian ) condition of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath1 requires the gravitational potential @xmath2 , the pressure @xmath3 , and the mass density @xmath4 in the equilibrium configuration of the fluid to be constant on the same set of surfaces . take a fluid element and displace it perpendicularly to these surfaces , on a timescale slow enough to keep it in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding matter , but not necessarily slow enough to exchange heat and particles with its surroundings or reach chemical equilibrium by internal processes .",
    "therefore , the fluid element will generally reach a different density than the surrounding matter , and a buoyancy force will either increase or decrease its initial displacement . the buoyancy force per unit mass per unit displacement ( taken to be positive if it acts so as to restore the fluid element to its initial position )",
    "is the squared brunt - visl frequency , @xmath5|\\vec g|^2,\\ ] ] where the subscripts `` @xmath6 '' and `` @xmath7 '' refer , respectively , to variations in the background equilibrium fluid and in the perturbed fluid element . if @xmath8 the fluid can support oscillations with buoyant restoring forces ( gravity waves ) and characteristic frequency @xmath9 . if @xmath10 , the fluid is unstable to convective overturn .",
    "take the entropy per baryon of the equilibrium fluid to be @xmath11 , and its chemical composition to be parameterized by a set of variables @xmath12 ( abundance , per baryon , of particle species @xmath13 ) .",
    "the pressure is used to mark the depth in the fluid at which the variables are to be evaluated .",
    "assume that the displaced fluid element does not change its internal variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the condition for stable stratification , @xmath16 , can then be rewritten in the alternative forms @xmath17 or ( @xcite ) @xmath18 where , in the usual thermodynamic notation , the variables in the subscripts are to be held constant when taking the partial derivatives .",
    "if the sum involving the composition gradient can be neglected ( as usually the case in non - degenerate stars such as the sun and other main - sequence or giant stars ) , the condition reduces to the familiar schwarzschild condition ( @xcite ) of decreasing entropy per baryon with increasing pressure .",
    "in what follows , it is assumed that the fluid is _ isentropic _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath19 constant throughout ) and that in the unperturbed configuration the matter is _ fully catalyzed _ ,",
    "i.e. , the parameters @xmath20 are those corresponding to full chemical ( and thermodynamic ) equilibrium at the local pressure .",
    "this equilibrium state is determined by minimizing the enthalpy per baryon , @xmath21 over all values of @xmath22 allowed by conservation laws , @xmath23 at given entropy per baryon @xmath24 , the resulting function @xmath25 defines a curve on the pressure - enthalpy plane ( see fig .",
    "point @xmath26 on the curve represents the initial ( equilibrium ) state of the fluid element to be perturbed .",
    "the perturbation , at constant @xmath27 and @xmath22 , takes the fluid to a different pressure and _ out of equilibrium _ , therefore to a point _ above _ the equilibrium curve .",
    "the trajectory of the fluid element is tangent to the equilibrium curve at the point representing the equilibrium state of the fluid element , @xmath28 and curves above the equilibrium line to both sides of this point , @xmath29 where the identity can be obtained from standard thermodynamic relations , together with the minimum condition on @xmath30 in equilibrium .",
    "the inequality becomes an _ equality _ only in the special cases when either the equilibrium concentrations @xmath31 do not depend on pressure , or the enthalpy is insensitive to changes in these concentrations .",
    "we note that @xmath32 is the _ volume per baryon _ , so equation ( 7 ) can be interpreted as a condition on the derivatives of @xmath33 with respect to pressure : @xmath34 in the non - relativistic limit , the mass density @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the ( constant ) baryon mass , so equation ( 8) is equivalent to the condition for convective stability or marginal stability ( eq .",
    "3 ) for an isentropic equilibrium state . in the more general case of a relativistic fluid ,",
    "the gravitating mass is the enthalpy ( including rest mass ; e.g. , @xcite ) , rather than the rest mass alone .",
    "therefore @xmath4 should be interpreted as the enthalpy per unit volume , @xmath37 . since , to lowest order , the changes in @xmath30 are the same in the perturbations and in the equilibrium state ( eq .",
    "6 ) , the differences in @xmath4 are still dominated by the differences in @xmath33 , and the argument goes through as before .",
    "we conclude that _ isentropic , fully catalyzed matter in a gravitational field is never unstable to convection _ ( and usually stably stratified ) .",
    "of course , the stability is enhanced if there is an additional , positive contribution from the entropy gradient to the brunt - visl frequency ( @xmath38 ) , as is the case in an isothermal fluid .",
    "an indirect argument leading to the same conclusion could have been given by _",
    "reductio ad absurdum_. assume that the matter is isentropic , in chemical equilibrium , but _",
    "unstable _ to convection .",
    "then , convective overturn interchanges fluid elements initially at different pressures , which at their new positions are out of chemical equilibrium . over a long enough time , reactions reestablish chemical equilibrium , and therefore the initial , unstable state .",
    "this process leads to a _ perpetuum mobile _ ,",
    "inconsistent with energy conservation .",
    "this argument , although strongly arguing for the previous conclusion , gives no insight into the local physics that prevents the described process from occuring , but instead provides an additional motivation for the analysis given above .",
    "let us now consider the application of the result to matter inside neutron stars .",
    "immediately after the initial collapse , these stars are hot and opaque to neutrinos ( @xcite ) , whose non - uniform distribution violates the condition of full chemical equilibrium . both this effect and a significant entropy gradient act towards destabilizing the star ( @xcite ) , leading to vigorous convection ( @xcite ) . however , neutron stars older than a few seconds have lost essentially all their initial entropy and no longer have any neutrinos trapped inside ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at this time",
    ", they have settled into an essentially zero - entropy , full chemical equilibrium state .",
    "the result derived in the previous section implies that , regardless of the large uncertainties in the equation of state for dense matter ( @xcite ) , these stars are stably stratified .",
    "marginal stability is in principle possible , but unlikely to hold over extended regions .",
    "furthermore , the small remaining entropy is distributed so as to give a nearly uniform temperature ( @xcite ) , which also has a stabilizing effect .",
    "the implications of stable stratification for different aspects of neutron star astrophysics have been mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the writing of this letter was motivated by a talk given by c. thompson within the program on _ spin and magnetism in young neutron stars _ at the institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara .",
    "parts of it are based on discussions with p. goldreich which took place several years before .",
