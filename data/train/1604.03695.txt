    "by exploiting the increased degree of freedom in the spatial domain , massive multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) can enhance the spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency by orders of magnitude @xcite . to harvest the benefits of massive mimo",
    ", the base station ( bs ) needs the accurate channel state information ( csi ) in the downlink for beamforming , resource allocation , and other operations .",
    "however , it is challenging for the bs to acquire the accurate downlink csi in frequency division duplex ( fdd ) based massive mimo , since the overhead used for the downlink channel estimation and feedback can be prohibitively high .",
    "most of the researches sidestep this challenge by assuming the time division duplex ( tdd ) protocol . in tdd",
    "based massive mimo , the csi in the uplink can be more easily acquired at the bs due to the limited number of users , and the channel reciprocity property can be exploited to realize the downlink channel estimation using the uplink channel estimation . however , in tdd massive mimo , the csi acquired in the uplink may not be always accurate for the downlink due to the calibration error of radio frequency chains @xcite .",
    "in addition , frequency division duplex ( fdd ) protocol still dominates current wireless networks , where the downlink channel estimation is necessary , since the channel reciprocity does not hold .",
    "thus , it is of great importance to explore an efficient approach to enable massive mimo to be backward compatible with current wireless networks @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the reliable and efficient channel estimation and feedback for fdd massive mimo .",
    "channel estimations in small - scale mimo are usually based on orthogonal pilots . in long term",
    "evolution - advanced ( lte - a ) , for example , pilots associated with different bs antennas occupy the different frequency - domain subcarriers @xcite .",
    "pilot signals can be also orthogonal in the time or code domain .",
    "however , the overhead of orthogonal pilots increases with the number of bs antennas , which becomes unaffordable for massive mimo .",
    "for fdd massive mimo , the work @xcite proposed a pilot design for the downlink channel estimation by exploiting the channel statistics .",
    "however , the acquisition of the downlink channel covariance matrix is challenging in practice .",
    "an open - loop and closed - loop training based channel estimation scheme was proposed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the long - term channel statistics required by the user may increase the training time and memory cost . in @xcite , a sparse channel estimation scheme was proposed to acquire csi with significantly reduced pilot overhead by exploiting the sparsity of time - domain channel impulse response ( cir ) .",
    "but this time - domain sparsity of the channels may not exist when the number of scatterers at the user side becomes large .",
    "furthermore , do not consider the channel feedback to the bs . in order to obtain the fine - grain spatial channel structures ,",
    "the conventional codebook based csi feedback schemes may become impossible , since the dimension of codebook can be huge in massive mimo .",
    "hence the design , storage , and encoding of the high - dimensional codebook can be difficult .",
    "the compressive sensing ( cs ) based channel feedback schemes for massive mimo were proposed to reduce the feedback overhead by exploiting the spatial correlation of csi .",
    "however , these schemes do not consider downlink channel estimation . by exploiting the spatially joint sparsity of multiple users channel matrices , the works proposed a joint orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) based csi acquisition scheme .",
    "however , this scheme can not adaptively adjust the required overhead according to the sparsity level of the channels .",
    "moreover , the spatially joint sparsity may disappear when the users are not spatially close .",
    "even for the best case that multiple users channel matrices share the spatially common sparsity , the sparse csi acquisition problem is a multiple - measurement - vectors ( mmv ) problem , where the reduction in required overhead is limited .",
    "recent study and experiments have shown that the wireless channels between the bs and users exhibit a small angle spread seen from the bs  .",
    "due to the small angle spread and large dimension of the channels , massive mimo channels exhibit the sparsity in the virtual angular domain  @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the spatial propagation characteristics of the wireless channels within the system bandwidth are nearly unchanged , such sparsity is shared by subchannels of different subcarriers when the widely used orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is considered .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as the _ spatially common sparsity within the system bandwidth _ @xcite . besides , due to the temporal correlation of the channels @xcite , massive mimo channels are quasi - static in several adjacent time slots or one time block consisting of multiple time slots . moreover",
    ", the support set of the sparse channels in the virtual angular domain is almost unchanged in multiple time blocks , which is referred to as the _ spatially common sparsity during multiple time blocks_.    by exploiting the spatially common sparsity and the temporal correlation of massive mimo channels , this paper proposes an adaptive channel estimation and feedback scheme with low overhead .",
    "the proposed scheme consists of two stages : a cs based adaptive csi acquisition with the adaptive training overhead and a follow - up closed - loop channel tracking with the adaptive pilot design .",
    "specifically , the bs transmits the proposed non - orthogonal pilot .",
    "the users simply feed back the received non - orthogonal pilot signals to the bs . according to the feedback signals , the cs based adaptive csi acquisition scheme acquires the downlink csi at the bs with the adaptive training time slot overhead . for this stage ,",
    "a distributed sparsity adaptive matching pursuit ( dsamp ) algorithm is proposed to acquire the csi , whereby the spatially common sparsity of massive mimo channels within the system bandwidth is exploited . by exploiting the spatially common sparsity of massive mimo channels during multiple time blocks ,",
    "the closed - loop channel tracking scheme is proposed to track the channels in the second stage . for this stage ,",
    "the bs can adaptively adjust the pilot signals according to the previous acquired csi , and a simple least squares ( ls ) algorithm is used to estimate the channels with improved performance . additionally , we generalize the results for the conventional mmv to the generalized mmv ( gmmv ) and provide the cramer - rao lower bound ( crlb ) of the proposed scheme , which enlightens us to design the non - orthogonal pilot signals .",
    "simulation results verify that the proposed scheme is superior to its counterparts , and it is capable of approaching the performance bound .",
    "we now summarize our novel contributions .    * * cs based adaptive csi acquisition scheme * : by exploiting the spatially common sparsity of massive mimo channels within the system bandwidth , this scheme substantially reduces the required time slot overhead for channel estimation and feedback , where the required time slot overhead is only dependent on the channel sparsity level , rather than the number of bs antennas as in conventional csi acquisition schemes . * * closed - loop channel tracking scheme * : by leveraging the spatially common sparsity of massive mimo channels during multiple time blocks , this scheme can further reduce the required time slot overhead . *",
    "* non - orthogonal downlink pilot design at bs * : i )  we theoretically prove that the gmmv outperforms the conventional mmv on the sparse signal recovery performance .",
    "this enlightens us to design the non - orthogonal pilot for cs based adaptive csi acquisition for improving channel estimation performance .",

    "the derived crlb enlightens us to adaptively design the non - orthogonal pilot according to the previous channel estimation for further improving performance . *",

    ", @xmath49 becomes the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) matrix .",
    "the channel vector in the virtual angular domain then simply means to ` sample ' the channel in the angular domain at equi - spaced angular intervals at the bs side , or equivalently to represent the channel in the virtual angular domain coordinates .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath53th element of @xmath50 is the channel gain consisting of the aggregation of all the paths , whose transmit / receive directions are within an angular window around the @xmath53th angular coordinate .",
    "as the bs is usually elevated high with few scatterers around , while users are located at low elevation with relatively rich local scatterers , the angle spread at the bs side is small .",
    "since the angle spread is limited at the bs , a small part of the elements in @xmath50 contain almost all the multipath signals reflected , diffracted , or refracted by scatterers around the user .",
    "if we take the typical angular - domain spread of @xmath54 and the ula with @xmath55 as an example @xcite , the uniformly virtual angular domain sampling interval is @xmath56 @xcite , and the vast majority of the channel energy is concentrated on around @xmath57 virtual angular domain coordinates , which is far smaller than the total dimension @xmath55 of the channel vector .",
    "consequently , @xmath50 exhibits the sparsity @xcite , namely , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the support set , and @xmath60 is the sparsity level .",
    "moreover , since the spatial propagation characteristics of the channels within the system bandwidth ( e.g. 10 mhz in typical lte - a systems ) are almost unchanged , the subchannels associated with different subcarriers share very similar scatterers in the propagation environment  @xcite .",
    "hence the small angle spreads of the subchannels within the system bandwidth are very similar .",
    "consequently , @xmath61 have the common sparsity , namely , @xmath62 which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : csi_matrix ] .              since the user mobility is not very high in massive mimo systems , the channels remain static for the duration of a block that consists of @xmath63 consecutive time slots , while the channels change from block to block . here",
    ", one time slot represents one ofdm symbol .",
    "this block fading implies that @xmath64 for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the channel at the @xmath67th time slot of the @xmath68th block and @xmath69 denotes the quasi - static channel in the @xmath68th block .",
    "similarly , there exists the quasi - static relationship @xmath70 for @xmath65 , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 being the virtual angular representations of @xmath66 and @xmath69 , respectively .    for massive mimo channels , @xmath73 due to the limited coherence time and the large number of bs antennas .",
    "for example , consider massive mimo systems with : the carrier frequency @xmath74ghz , the system bandwidth @xmath75mhz , the ofdm size @xmath76 , the number of bs antennas @xmath55 , and the maximum delay spread @xmath77 ( need the guard interval @xmath78 ) .",
    "suppose that the maximum mobile velocity of the supported users is @xmath79 km/h .",
    "then the maximum doppler frequency shift is @xmath80hz , where @xmath81 is the velocity of electromagnetic wave . hence the coherence time @xmath82 @xcite , or the coherence time slots @xmath83 , which is much smaller than @xmath29 .",
    "since the channels change from block to block , they must be estimated in every time block , which may impose very high complexity and overhead .",
    "fortunately , experiments and theoretical analysis have shown that although the channels vary continuously from one block to another , the variation rate of the channel angle spread is much lower than that of the associated channel gains @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of consecutive time blocks over the duration of which the common support of virtual angular domain channels holds .",
    "for the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : virtual_angle ] , assume that the distance between the bs and the user is @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "further assume the case of the mobile direction of the user being perpendicular to the direction connecting the bs and the user .",
    "then , over the duration of @xmath88 successive time blocks , the maximum variance in the virtual angular domain is around @xmath89 .",
    "such a small variance of the angle spread is negligible , compared to the resolution of the virtual angular domain @xmath90 .",

    "hence the total pilot overhead to estimate the complete mimo channel is @xmath104 .",
    "similarly , lte - a adopts the time - frequency orthogonal pilots as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pilot](b ) , which also needs @xmath105 .",
    "these two kinds of orthogonal pilots are equivalent , since both of them are based on the framework of nyquist sampling theorem and have the same pilot overhead .",

    "codebook based channel feedback schemes are widely adopted in small - scale mimo systems . however , to obtain the fine - grain spatial channel structures in massive mimo systems , the codebook size can be huge . moreover , the storage and encoding of large dimension codebook at the user is challenging . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we combine the channel estimation and feedback , whereby the csi acquisition is mainly realized at the bs which has sufficient computation capability . by exploiting the spatially common sparsity and temporal correlation of massive mimo channels ,",
    "the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the required overhead and complexity for channel estimation and feedback .",
    "the procedure of the proposed adaptive channel estimation and feedback scheme is first summarized .",

    "_ step 3 _ : the bs judges the reliability of the estimated sparse channels according to a pre - specified criterion .",
    "if the given criterion is met , the bs stops transmitting pilot in the following time slots , and the acquired csi at the bs is used for precoding and user scheduling in the current time block .",

    "it is seen that the proposed adaptive channel estimation and feedback scheme consists of two stages : the cs based adaptive csi acquisition in the @xmath68th time block , which includes _ step 1 _ to _ step 3 _ , and the following closed - loop channel tracking in the following @xmath108 time blocks , which includes _ step 1 _ and _ step 4_. we now detail all the key technical components .",
