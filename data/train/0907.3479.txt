    "however , for this absorber no associated metal lines are seen , including those of  @xmath76   , and  @xmath77   , which are normally expected .",

    "we also note that the wavelength region containing the  @xmath2   line ( redshifted to @xmath78   ) is not critically affected by ism atomic lines or contamination from h@xmath79 absorption .",
    "in order to assess the physical conditions in the absorber , and the dominant ionization mechanisms , we first considered the possibility of the gas being photoionized by an extragalactic ionizing radiation field as modeled by @xcite . with the measured values of column densities as constraints , we constructed photoionization models using the ionization code cloudy [ ver 08.00@xmath41 , @xcite ] for a range of values for ionization parameter ( log  @xmath80 ) , metallicity ( [ z / h ] ) , and column density . in the models we assume a solar abundance pattern of elements .",

    "a column density of @xmath85  , and [ z / h ] = -0.38 yields one such acceptable single phase solution for the photoionized medium ( see figure 2 ) . with a decrease in @xmath84 , the metallicity has to increase to recover the observed metal line strengths .",

    "an upper limit for @xmath84 can be established by limiting the path length of the absorber to physically realistic values . at @xmath88  , a density of @xmath83",

    "this implies a line of sight thickness of @xmath104  mpc , an exceedingly large value for a single absorber .",

    "the models show that for the @xmath107 to be lowered by even @xmath108  dex from the above value , and thus reduce the path length , the metallicity has to be supersolar ( [ z / h ] @xmath109 ) .",
