    "the prediction of the existence of black holes by general relativity is one of the most intriguing ones in all of theoretical physics , and there is now compelling evidence that such objects might indeed exist in nature . apart from thus describing , in all likelihood , real astrophysical objects , black holes are also viewed as a theoretical laboratory for ideas about the , not yet completely understood , laws of quantum gravity .",
    "these connections arise in particular through the analogy between the `` laws of black hole mechanics '' , and the laws of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "they strongly suggest that black holes should have some sort of ( quantum ) statistical mechanical description analogous to , say , the ( quantum ) statistical mechanical description of a gas comprised of atoms , see e.g.  @xcite for a review .    both in the astrophysical context , as well as in the context of quantum gravity , the striking _ uniqueness",
    "_ , also referred to as _ no hair property _ , of stationary black hole solutions plays an important role : all ( regular ) stationary , asymptotically flat solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations in @xmath0 dimensions are uniquely determined by their mass , angular momentum , and electric charge , and are in fact given by the kerr - newman family of solutions .",
    "in the astrophysical context , this result is important because one expects that real physical black hole systems , while not being stationary as long as they form , will eventually settle down and thus eventually become stationary . assuming this to be true , one",
    "can then restrict attention to the explicitly known kerr - newman family of solutions .",
    "moreover , one can study small non - stationary perturbations of such a system within the well - understood framework of linear perturbation theory , or by post - newtonian methods , possibly corrected by radiation - reaction effects , thus eliminating , in a large dynamical range , the need to solve numerically the full set of non - linear einstein - maxwell equations . in the quantum gravity context",
    ", one also relies in many approaches on the fact that the stationary black hole solutions are functions of only a few conserved charges .",
    "while many classical properties of black holes are probably lost in a full quantum regime , one still expects that such charges can be defined as quantum charge operators , that an ensemble of physical quantum states in the hilbert space , characterized by a definite values of these parameters , can be identified , and that quantities such as entropy can be assigned to such an ensemble .",
    "it is clearly of interest to ask whether a version of the black hole uniqueness theorem still holds under more general assumptions , for example ( a ) in the presence of other einstein - matter fields systems such as einstein - yang - mills , einstein - scalar fields , einstein - euler , einstein - vlasov , einstein - skyrmions , etc . and ( b ) in more than four spacetime dimensions .",
    "* a ) inclusion of matter fields : * as a rule of thumb , if the matter sector without coupling to gravity already contains soliton - like static or stationary solution , then one has to expect that the corresponding theory coupled to einstein - gravity has hairy black holes .",
    "this is , in some sense , not really surprising , so it is generally more interesting to study the uniqueness of systems in which the matter sector does not have soliton solutions in and of itself .",
    "an interesting example of this type is einstein - yang - mills theory .",
    "that theory does not have any soliton like solutions without coupling to gravity , and neither has the vacuum einstein theory .",
    "nevertheless , for suitable gauge groups ( @xmath1 ) , hairy black holes were found , to the surprise of many researches , in the coupled theory . while the solutions that were originally found turned out to be unstable , there do exist stable hairy black holes in other einstein - matter theories , and furthermore , there are even hairy black holes which do not have any kind of symmetry other than time - translations .",
    "thus , for several einstein - matter systems , the uniqueness theorems definitely fail to hold . for",
    "a detailed discussion of black hole uniqueness in @xmath0 , including many references , see the review  @xcite .",
    "* b ) higher dimensions : * the possibility that there could exist more than the four macroscopically large , observed , dimensions has been pursued almost from the beginning of general relativity theory .",
    "one of the main attractive features of this idea , common to most approaches , is that matter fields naturally `` arise from geometry '' . in string theory ,",
    "extra dimensions appear naturally from constraints imposed by the quantum nature of strings propagating in a higher dimensional target space ( usually @xmath2 , or @xmath3 ) .",
    "particular values for the number of dimensions also arise in supergravity theories due to the constraining nature of the supersymmetry algebra . in practice ,",
    "string theories are often analyzed within the supergravity approximation ( especially in the context of the ads - cft correspondence and its variants ) , hence by some sort of classical gravity theory in higher dimensional spacetime .    from a physical viewpoint one",
    "has to explain why , if extra dimensions indeed exist , we do not directly observe them . in the standard kaluza - klein approach ,",
    "the extra dimensions are assumed to be extremely small ( e.g. tori , or other compact manifolds with special properties , having small volume ) .",
    "then , any fields with non - trivial dependence in the extra dimensions effectively have a very large mass ( small debroglie wavelength ) , and thus would decay into lighter fields in a quantum field theoretic description .",
    "there are , however , also other theoretical scenarios in which the extra dimensions are not small , but macroscopically large . in this type of model",
    ", it is assumed that the four dimensions which we observe effectively constitute some timelike submanifold ( `` brane '' ) in a higher dimensional spacetime , to which the relevant matter fields ( standard model ) are confined in some way . in the classical context ,",
    "one means by this usually that the contribution to the stress tensor by observable matter fields is localized on , or very near to , the brane .",
    "apart from studying black hole solutions with boundary conditions at infinity corresponding to the kaluza - klein respectively brane setup , one can also study higher dimensional black holes with standard asymptotically flat boundary conditions , i.e. which are asymptotic to @xmath4-dimensional minkowski space ( or e.g. @xmath4-dimensional ( anti-)desitter spacetime , where appropriate ) .",
    "the latter are motivated particularly in the context of holography , wherein a higher dimensional gravity theory with ads - boundary describes a quantized field theory on the boundary .",
    "asymptotically flat boundary conditions are not well - motivated physically in higher dimensions .",
    "however , they can serve as a clean setup to isolate new phenomena of higher dimensional gravity theories .    in this review article",
    ", we will concentrate on uniqueness theorems in higher dimensional gravity theories , ( b ) .",
    "of course , because higher dimensional theories can always be reduced to lower dimensional ones with additional matter fields via the kaluza - klein reduction process , ( b ) includes also many models in ( a ) .",
    "not surprisingly therefore , much less is known about the uniqueness theory of higher dimensional black holes than in 4 dimensions , in much the same way as much less is known about general einstein - matter systems compared to the vacuum theory in 4 dimensions .",
    "generally speaking , one might expect to be in either of the following three , qualitatively different , situations :    1 .",
    "( `` best possible case '' ) this would mean that all black hole solutions in the given theory ( e.g. vacuum general relativity in @xmath4 dimensions , or including various special matter fields ) would be specified uniquely by a finite set of `` conserved charges '' that are calculable as surface integrals over a large @xmath5-dimensional surface near infinity .",
    "for example , in pure einstein - gravity , these would be the conserved adm - type mass , and the adm - angular momenta ( or more restrictively even , as in @xmath0 , the angular momenta corresponding to rotational killing fields ) . in theories involving also matter fields such as maxwell fields",
    ", these would include additionally e.g. electric / magnetic - type charges etc .",
    "it is clear that we can not to be in this situation for general matter fields , because it is known even in @xmath6 dimensions that black hole uniqueness theorem in this form does not hold e.g. for the einstein - yang - mills system , see ( a ) .",
    "it is also clear that we can not expect to be in this situation even for pure einstein - gravity in @xmath4 dimensions , because solutions of @xmath6-dimensional einstein-@xmath7-yang - mills theory are solutions of this theory via the kaluza - klein reduction process e.g. if the @xmath4-dimensional manifold is @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the 4-dimensional spacetime manifold .",
    "the latter solutions are not asymptotically flat from the point of view of the higher dimensional spacetime ( they are asymptotically kaluza - klein , see below ) , so one might hope that black hole uniqueness in the sense of the `` best possible case '' might hold e.g. in pure einstein - gravity in @xmath4 dimensions , if we restrict to stationary black holes that are asymptotically flat in the @xmath4-dimensional sense ( i.e. , asymptotic to @xmath4-dimensional minkowski spacetime ) . however , this  to the surprise of many researchers  also turned out to be false when emparan and reall  @xcite discovered 5-dimensional regular , stationary asymptotically flat black `` rings '' which had the same mass and angular momenta as the previously known myers - perry solutions  @xcite , but were not isometric to these and even had a different horizon topology ( explicit forms of many higher dimensional black hole solutions are given e.g. in the review  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we definitely can not be be in the `` best possible case '' .",
    "( `` intermediate situation '' ) since higher dimensional black holes can not be uniquely specified by their conserved charges ( adm - mass , adm - angular momenta , electric charge(s ) , @xmath10 ) alone , one might hope that they might be uniquely specified if one adds to these parameters further ones that somehow specify internal degrees of freedom of the stationary black holes that can not be read off from the asymptotics at infinity via the conserved charges alone .",
    "a hint that this expectation might not be unreasonable comes from other systems of pde s of geometrical nature admitting soliton - like solutions , but not containing the gravitational field . for example , it is well - known , that the space of self - dual solutions to the yang - mills equations @xmath11 , modulo gauge transformations , on a sufficiently generic , compact , riemannian @xmath6-manifold @xmath9 is itself a manifold @xmath12 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , whose dimension is given by @xmath13 [ for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the second chern number of the associated bundle @xmath16 , interpreted as the instanton number .",
    "the local coordinates on @xmath12 have an interpretation in terms of the relative position , orientation , and size , of the instantons represented by the gauge field .",
    "similarly , the space of @xmath17-centered bps monopole solutions modulo gauge transformation on @xmath18 with gauge group @xmath7 is known to be a finite - dimensional manifold , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the local coordinates of @xmath12 again have an interpretation in terms of the position , orientation , velocity and magnetic charges of the monopoles .",
    "furthermore , in both examples , the dimension of the space of solutions modulo gauge transformations is related to the index of some differential operator . by analogy with these non - linear systems of pde s",
    ", one may hope that the space of , say black hole solutions with @xmath17 components of the event horizon of given topology modulo gauge transformations , may be given by a manifold @xmath12 ( or maybe more generally , a space with certain singularities ) whose local coordinates describe the relative position , size , orientation etc . of the black hole horizons , and possibly other data encoding the topology / shape of the ambient manifold surrounding the black holes .",
    "one may further hope that the dimension of the space @xmath12 may be related to the index of some operator associated with the linearized einstein equations .",
    "the present knowledge of black hole solutions in pure einstein - gravity does not contradict this scenario , and it seems plausible that this should be the typical situation for supersymmetric solutions ( in supergravities ) .",
    "however , there are no general results .",
    "+ from the classical viewpoint , proving scenario 2 ) would be no less satisfactory than 1 ) .",
    "however , in the context of quantum gravity , the situation is less clear .",
    "while the conserved charges should retain their role also in quantum theory as operators whose eigenvalues are the charge quantum numbers of the corresponding quantum states , ( as they do in ordinary quantum field theory ) , the role of the further `` internal parameters '' in scenario 2 ) at the quantum level is much less clear .",
    "( `` worst case scenario '' ) the most general possibility is that the space of stationary black hole solutions , with , say , a fixed number of horizon components , is not finite dimensional in nature , i.e. that there are `` free function(s ) worth '' of solutions with given asymptotic charges . in this case , there seems to be little point in trying to prove a `` uniqueness theorem '' .    in summary , while it is known that we are not in case 1 ) , it is unknown whether we are in case 2 ) or 3 ) , even for asymptotically flat , stationary vacuum black holes in @xmath19 dimensions .",
    "related to the question of black hole uniqueness is that of stability .",
    "if a black hole is unstable , then one may expect that the endpoint of the evolution of an instability will be a new kind of black hole ",
    "assuming of course that the system settles down at all .",
    "furthermore , stability analyses can in principle detect the existence of new stationary black holes which are perturbatively close to a given family of black holes .",
    "to understand the stability issue for a given family of stationary black holes , one may , for simplicity , start by looking at the linearized field equations around that background ( although one should emphasize that linear stability does not necessarily imply stability against small _ finite _ perturbations ) .",
    "unfortunately , already in the simplest cases such as a schwarzschild black hole , the analysis of these equations is still rather involved  @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . for a more modern treatment of the scalar version of the stability problem based on the method of `` energy norms '' ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite . ) in the four dimensional kerr case , there is available the teukolsky formalism  @xcite which effectively reduces the full set of coupled perturbation equations to that of a single complex variable .",
    "furthermore , that equation can be studied via separation of variables techniques , and this analysis shows that the kerr black hole is stable `` mode - by - mode '' .",
    "unfortunately , there is no known formalism of comparable power neither in higher dimensions , or in 4 dimensions with more general matter fields .",
    "progress has been made ( see  @xcite and refs . therein ) in higher dimensions for certain kinds of stationary black holes which are characterized by a wide separation of scales between various parameters characterizing the black hole , e.g. `` long - thin '' ( highly prolate ) , or `` flat thin '' ( highly oblate ) horizons , partly based on numerical methods .",
    "some of these black holes have thereby been determined to be unstable , and the nature of the instability is qualitatively similar to that known before for the 5-dimensional black string  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no complete picture .",
    "there are also other approaches to the black hole stability problem based on variational principles related to `` local penrose inequality '' , or on the notion of thermodynamic stability , see  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , also these methods do not give a complete picture of stability of standard families of higher dimensional black holes .",
    "linearized analyses can also detect whether a new family of stationary black holes is `` branching off '' from a given family . indeed ,",
    "if a given black hole admits a stationary ( non - gauge ) perturbation , which is not tangent to the original family of solutions , then this is evidence  although not proof  for a new family of solutions .",
    "this has also been carried out in some examples  @xcite , and evidence has been found for the existence of a 70-parameter family of new stationary solutions in @xmath20 dimensions branching off from myers - perry black holes in a certain parameter range  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "evidence has been found for families of solutions with a very small number of killing vectors ( i.e. with the minimum possible symmetry compatible with the rigidity theorem , see below ) .",
    "evidence in the same direction has also come from an entirely different approximation scheme , wherein the black object is treated as some sort of extended test - object , in much the same way as one can treat small objects as point - particles .",
    "this so - called `` blackfold approach ''  @xcite likewise indicates the existence of , yet unknown , asymptotically flat solutions with a very small number of killing vectors .",
    "thus , it appears from a variety of viewpoints that the manifold of black hole solutions in higher dimensions is largely unknown .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows : we first outline , schematically , the proof of the black hole uniqueness theorem for einstein - maxwell theory in 4 dimensions .",
    "we then critically review to what extent the steps in this analysis generalize to higher dimensional theories , outlining the method of proof of the key intermediate theorems , which are also interesting in their own right as general structure theorems for higher dimensional black holes .",
    "we then present black hole uniqueness theorems in higher dimensions in the static , resp .",
    "stationary , case in higher dimensions . in the first case",
    "a rather complete picture emerges ( in particular for supersymmetric solutions in certain supergravity theories ) , but in the second case , results are currently available only if one imposes more symmetry on the solution than what one has the right to expect in view of the rigidity theorem and also the numerical evidence",
    ". we will mostly restrict the discussion to either vacuum general relativity or simple extensions thereof , but we will try to indicate in what situation the techniques can be generalized to more general theories . also , we will restrict attention mostly to asymptotically flat , or asymptotically kaluza - klein boundary conditions at infinity , and we will ( except in the discussion of supersymmetric solutions ) usually assume that the black hole is not extremal .",

    "this is the killing - spinor condition for @xmath112 minimal supergravity .",
    "the existence of a killing spinor is very restrictive  much more so than demanding merely the existence of a killing vector .",
    "this can be seen e.g. from the fact that , since a supersymmetry transformation `` squares to an infinitesimal translation '' ( i.e. a lie - derivative ) , the `` square '' of a killing - spinor automatically has to be a killing vector , and also a symmetry of the other bosonic fields in the theory , i.e. @xmath456 in our case .",
    "more precisely , define t^:= _ ab  |^a ^^b  , where @xmath457 is the standard 2-dimensional symplectic matrix .",
    "then @xmath32 is necessarily a time - like , or null , killing vector field , @xmath90 , and one also necessarily has @xmath458 . if @xmath60 represents an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime , then @xmath32 is by construction tangent to the generators of the horizon , and because it is timelike or null both inside and outside the horizon , and null on the horizon , we must have @xmath459 on the horizon . using the standard formula for the surface gravity @xmath460",
    "then shows that @xmath461 , i.e. the black hole is necessarily extremal .",
    "in fact , the existence of a killing spinor is even more stringent than the above argument suggests , because it implies many more differential relations than just the killing vector equation .",
    "these have been exploited systematically by  @xcite ( and previously by tod  @xcite in the case of @xmath221 supergravity in @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite proceed by defining the real tensorial quantities @xmath462 by f  ^ab = |^a ^b  , (    x_1 + ix_2 & ix_3 + -ix_3 & x_1 - ix_2    ) ^ab = |^a _ ^b  x^x^  . the field equations and killing spinor equation then imply , among other things , the following further relations : f^2 = g(t , t )  , f = - i_t f  , x_i = 0  , _",
    "5 x_i = - f x_i  .",
    "it turns out that , starting from these equations , one can locally determine  @xcite all possible analytic field configurations with killing spinor , which can then be analytically continued . in this way , one can obtain , in principle , a classification ( which includes black holes , but also other types of spacetimes ) of supersymmetric bosonic configurations @xmath463 .",
    "we think that it would be worthwhile to understand in detail the global structure of these solutions .",
    "progress towards this goal has been made in the special case of spherical horizons by  @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis can presumably be carried out in other , more complicated , supergravity theories . of particular interest",
    "would be a similarly complete classification of solutions with various numbers of independent killing spinors in 11-dimensional supergravity .",
    "progress in this direction has been made e.g. in the papers  @xcite , see also references therein .",
    "thus , in supersymmetric theories , the classification of black hole solutions via killing - spinors seems a feasible  albeit complicated  task .",
    "however , one can not hope to obtain in this way solutions at non - zero temperature , i.e. non - extremal ones .",
    "in this review , we have tried to give an overview about what is known about black hole uniqueness theorems for higher dimensional , stationary , black hole spacetimes . along the way",
    ", we have described several related general structural results about such black holes such as the topology , rigidity , and staticity theorems , which are also of independent interest .",
    "these arguments involve a considerable breadth of mathematical methods , from differential geometry , to topology , to group theory , to ergodic theory , and to pde theory , which are combined in a non - trivial fashion .",
    "as we have indicated , the state of knowledge concerning higher dimensional black holes in general , and uniqueness theorems in particular , is much less satisfactory than in four dimensions , although also in four dimensions there are still many open issues for many theories other than einstein - maxwell theory . in general , it seems that our knowledge about static or supersymmetric black holes in higher dimensions is more advanced than for stationary solutions , but there are also still important open issues for static and supersymmetric black holes .",
    "as open issues that in our opinion deserve attention we would like to mention :    1 .   to obtain uniqueness theorems for stationary higher dimensional black holes",
    ", one needs to assume more symmetries than seem to be generic on the basis of the investigations  @xcite , and one is at the moment restricted to models in which the dimensionally reduced theories can be cast into the framework of sigma - models with negatively curved target spaces .",
    "there are some ideas how to replace the interval structure that seems important in existing theorems  @xcite , but more ideas are needed .",
    "2 .   to obtain uniqueness theorems for static black holes , one is for the moment restricted to asymptotically flat boundary conditions , excluding thus e.g. the , very interesting and relevant , kaluza - klein type boundary conditions .",
    "3 .   it would also be important to achieve a full classicfication of supersymmetric black holes in more complicated supergravity theories than have been analyzed so far , in particular in 11-dimensional supergravity .",
