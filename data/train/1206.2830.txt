    "magnetic moment bearing , rare earth containing , quasicrystals , being an example of well ordered solids with sharp diffraction peaks but with conventional requirement of translational symmetry lifted , present a rare example of an `` ideal '' spin glass , in which the spin glass state probably arises from the multiplicity of the r - r distances in the quasicrystalline lattice , @xcite as opposed to a substitutional disorder in crystalline metallic spin glasses .",
    "@xcite successful growth of large , single grain , r@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 ( r = rare earth ) icosahedral quasicrystals @xcite allowed for detailed studies of the physical properties of the spin glass state in these materials , leading , in particular , to a clear delineation of the experimental differences between heisenberg and non - heisenberg spin glasses .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the freezing temperature , @xmath4 , is lower for the gd - based , heisenberg spin glasses , than for r = tb - er , non heisenberg spin glasses for the samples with the same values of the de gennes factor [ @xmath5 , or the weiss temperature . as a consequence , for e.g. ( tb@xmath6gd@xmath7)@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 and ( dy@xmath6gd@xmath7)@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 pseudo - ternary solid solution",
    "the maximum in @xmath4 was observed for @xmath8 when a crossover from from heisenberg to non - heisenberg behavior occurs .",
    "@xcite    based on the large data sets in refs .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that two factors give rise to the spin glass state in the r@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 quasicrystals : distribution of r - r distances and distribution of easy axis ( or easy plane ) in the non - heisenberg members of the family . since (",
    "i ) a heisenberg quasicrystal gd@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 has a spin glass low temperature state , @xcite and ( ii ) an attempt to design spin glass just by mixing rare earths with different anisotropies in a crystalline structure has failed so far , @xcite the distribution of the r - r distances is apparently a _ necessary _ and _ sufficient _ condition for the formation of a spin glass , and distribution of magnetic anisotropies is neither .    the frequency dependence of the freezing temperature ( the position of the peak in ac susceptibility ) has been observed and discussed in a number of spin glass systems . @xcite the fractional relative change in the freezing temperature per decade of frequency , @xmath9 $ ] ( @xmath10 is frequency ) was noticed to vary by more than an order of magnitude for different spin glasses .",

    "r@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 quasicrystals , with magnetic moment bearing rare earths give us an opportunity to address trends in the frequency dependence of the freezing temperature in the family of spin glasses with heisenberg and non - heisenberg members , a task that is rather difficult to undertake in dilute , substitutional , crystalline spin glasses . to the best of out knowledge frequency dependent measurements in this family were performed and analyzed so far only for tb@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 .",

    "@xcite the samples with r = tb , dy , gd , gd@xmath18y@xmath19 , gd@xmath20y@xmath21 , and gd@xmath22tb@xmath22 , were chosen for this work thus covering heisenberg , diluted ( disordered ) heisenberg , and non - heisenberg spin glasses .",
    "low temperature , low field ( 25 oe ) zero field cooled - warming and field cooled - warming dc susceptibility measurements were done in a quantum design mpms-7 squid magnetometer so as to ensure that sample chosen indeed have a low temperature spin glass state and are not rhombohedral approximants with a long range magnetic order . @xcite .",
    "the low temperature ac susceptibility was measured in 3 - 5 oe ac field at frequencies in the range of 10 hz to 10 khz , in zero dc field using the acms option of quantum design ppms-14 instrument .",
    "a criterion @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the real part of the ac susceptibility ) was used to infer a value for @xmath4 .",
    "examples of low temperature ac susceptibility measurements are shown in fig .",
    "the maximum in @xmath24 clearly shifts to higher temperatures at higher frequencies for the non - heisenberg spin glasses tb@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 and dy@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 and is almost unchanged for the heisenberg spin glass gd@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 .    fig .",
    "[ f2 ] summarizes all of such measurements performed in this work : whereas with three orders of magnitude frequency change , the @xmath4 of non - heisenberg spin glasses ( r = tb , dy ) increases by about 20% , the @xmath4 of the heisenberg spin glass ( r = gd ) increases by mere @xmath25% .",
    "if substitutional disorder is added to the heisenberg spin glass ( r = gd@xmath18y@xmath19 , gd@xmath20y@xmath21 ) the change is slightly larger , but still very much below those for the non - heisenberg systems . for a mixture of heisenberg and non - heisenberg magnetic moments , r = gd@xmath22tb@xmath22 ,",

    "the fits are rather insensitive to the value of @xmath17 . here , for all samples , we have used @xmath26 hz obtained for tb@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 @xcite , although the values of @xmath17 as high as @xmath27 hz give a comparable quality fits .",

    "@xcite for the heisenberg and disordered heisenberg spin glasses , @xmath29 , and the values are closer to each other .",
    "the significance of this difference is not clear at this point .",
    "it might just point out to some limitations of the vogel - fulcher fits for a small span of the freezing temperatures and a fixed value of @xmath17 throughout the family .",
    "the systematic study of the frequency dependence of the spin glass freezing temperatures in the ternary and pseudo - ternary r@xmath1mg@xmath2zn@xmath3 quasicrystals revealed a distinct difference between non - heisenberg and heisenberg members of the family , the latter showing significantly weaker response to the measurement frequency change ( at least in the studied 10 hz to 10 khz range ) .",
    "it appears that the distribution of magnetic anisotropies ( easy axis or plane ) in the non - heisenberg members changes the ( low frequency ) magnetic dynamics of these spin glasses .",
    "similar trend was suggested ( based on a very limited experimental data set ) in crystalline rb@xmath30 spin glasses .",
    "@xcite it would be of interest to see if such distinct behavior is observed in other families of magnetic rare earth containing spin glasses , and if so , what theoretical models can be used or developed to account for such behavior .",
