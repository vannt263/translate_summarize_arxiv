    ", many phenomena such as the diffusion of innovations @xcite , political mobilization @xcite , viral marketing @xcite and coordination games @xcite are characterized by a complex contagion where nodes need to be connected to multiple sources in order to induce a change of their state @xcite .",
    "in addition to this induced transition , individuals may spontaneously change their opinion or banks can spontaneously fail @xcite .",
    "the consequences of the interplay between spontaneous damage , induced failure and recovery of components in spatially embedded systems are crucial for systemic risk @xcite , predictability and controllability but have not yet been systematically explored .",

    "we here show how the process of embedding and the related characteristic link length impact the predictability of failure - recovery dynamics in networks .",
    "our model is based on three fundamental processes ( i ) spontaneous failure independent of the neighborhood ( internal failure ) , ( ii ) failure induced by failed neighboring nodes if their number exceeds a threshold ( external failure ) and ( iii ) spontaneous recovery ( see fig . [",

    "the interplay between these three processes results in a phase diagram with a metastable regime where hysteresis and switching between two coexisting states are observed @xcite . in technological systems , hysteresis effects might be potentially harmful since slight changes of the system s control parameters can entail drastic and abrupt transitions from a seemingly globally stable state to macroscopic inactivity or large - scale outage @xcite .",

    "we therefore propose here that the extent of the metastable regime in the parameter space of the phase diagram can be regarded as a measure of predictability .",
    "the larger the metastable regime the lower is the predictability of the system . based on this measure",
    "we find that the networks predictability strongly increases with its regularity .",
    "in particular , for the euclidean lattice , hysteresis only occurs in a very small range of the spontaneous failure rate  compared to random networks with the same average number of neighbors .",
