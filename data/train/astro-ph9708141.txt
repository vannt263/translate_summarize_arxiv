    "a comparison of the galaxy density field derived from a redshift survey with the mass - density fluctuation field inferred from galaxy peculiar velocity data , allows one to test both gravitational instability theory ( gi ) and models for the relation between galaxies and mass .",
    "if the data are consistent with the assumed model , one can then estimate the value of the cosmological density parameter @xmath12 .",
    "this can be illustrated , for simplicity , by the linear approximation to gi , for which the relation between the mass density fluctuation field @xmath13/\\bar\\rho$ ] and the peculiar velocity field @xmath14 is @xmath15 with distances measured in  ( , the hubble constant is set to unity ) .",
    "observations of galaxy peculiar velocities allow us to measure the quantity on the left - hand side , while galaxy redshift surveys provide a measure of the _ galaxy _ density fluctuation field , @xmath16 . the latter need not be identical to @xmath17 ( , bardeen 1986 ; dekel & rees 1987 ) ;",
    "we adopt here the simplest toy model relating the two fields , linear biasing , @xmath18 where @xmath19 refers to the galaxies in a specific redshift survey and at a fixed smoothing length . with this model for biasing , can be rewritten as a relation between the observable quantities , @xmath20 thus , in the context of linear gi and linear biasing , the comparison of peculiar velocities and the galaxy distribution enables a measurement of @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xmath21 provides only an indirect estimate of @xmath12 , because it is a degenerate combination of @xmath12 and @xmath19 .",
    "there is quite an extensive literature on the comparison of peculiar velocity and redshift survey data to measure @xmath21 ( for reviews see dekel 1994 ; strauss & willick 1995 ; strauss 1997b ; dekel 1997ab ; dekel , burstein & white 1997 for a general review of @xmath12 measurements ) .",
    "the comparison is not straightforward : the peculiar velocity data are sparse , inhomogeneously distributed , limited to the radial component , and quite noisy , while the redshift data need to be corrected to real space and may trace the mass distribution in a non - trivial way .",
    "these difficulties give rise to a variety of statistical biases which depend on the details of the analysis carried out .",
    "there are two approaches to this problem , depending on whether the quantities that are actually compared are velocities or densities . integrating both sides of yields a predicted velocity field given measurements of the galaxy density field ( equation  [ eq : v = int_over_x_lin ] below ) .",
    "comparison of these predictions to observed radial peculiar velocities allows a determination of @xmath21 ( strauss 1989 ; kaiser 1991 ; hudson 1994 ) .",
    "one can make the comparison more sophisticated by smoothing the two velocity fields before comparing them ( davis , nusser & willick 1997 ) , or by using the predicted velocity field to minimize the scatter in the distance indicator relation from which the peculiar velocities are measured in the first place ( strauss 1989 ; roth 1994 ; schlegel 1995 ; shaya , peebles , & tully 1995 ; willick 1997b ) . for  galaxies",
    ", these velocity comparisons yield values of @xmath10 ranging from @xmath22 ( willick 1997b ) to @xmath23 ( kaiser 1991 ) , depending on the details of the analysis , the smoothing scale , and the data used .",
    "davis ( 1997 ) have claimed inconsistencies between the peculiar velocity and redshift survey data in the context of gi and linear biasing .",
    "alternatively , one can use the potent method (   [ sec : potent ] ) to recover the density fluctuation field from the peculiar velocity data and use , or its nonlinear extension ( see the discussion in   [ sec : potent_veldel ] ) , to compare to the galaxy density field .",
    "dekel ( 1993 , hereafter pi93 ) carried out such an analysis , using the  1.936 jy redshift survey ( strauss 1992b ) , and the mark ii compilation of peculiar velocities ( burstein 1989 ) .",
    "the advantages of the differential form include the facts that the direct comparison of densities is _ local _",
    "( whereas the velocity field is sensitive to the mass distribution in a large volume , perhaps even outside the sampled volume ) , it is independent of reference frame , and it allows direct control over the smoothing of the fields .",
    "monte - carlo tests showed that the potent density field of pi93 was biased in a variety of ways , forcing the use of an elaborate maximum likelihood technique to quantify the consistency between data and model , and to measure @xmath10 .",
    "pi93 did find consistency , and concluded that @xmath24 at 95% confidence .",
    "a similar comparison of potent densities with optically selected galaxies by hudson ( 1995 ) yielded an acceptable fit , with @xmath25 ( 1@xmath26 ) .",
    "the current paper , like pi93 , follows the general approach of a _ density _ comparison , but is a significant step forward due to a number of improvements in the quantity and quality of the data and the methods of analysis .",
    "in particular :    * the current analysis is based on the mark iii catalog of peculiar velocities ( willick 1995 , 1996 , 1997a ) . with @xmath27 galaxies , it is more than three times bigger than the mark ii data set , and has better space coverage .",
    "the data sets composing the mark iii catalog have been treated with more care , especially in self - consistently calibrating the tully - fisher ( tf ) relations , grouping , and correcting for inhomogeneous malmquist bias (   [ sec : potent ] ) .",
    "* the potent method for deriving the density fluctuation field @xmath28 from peculiar velocity data has been much improved since pi93 (   [ sec : potent ] ; dekel 1997 ) . *",
    "the current analysis uses the  1.2 jy redshift survey ( fisher 1995 ) , containing twice as many galaxies as in the 1.936 jy survey . *",
    "the method for deriving a uniform galaxy density field @xmath29 from the redshift data has been improved in several ways since pi93 (   [ sec : iras ] ) . *",
    "the availability of much more realistic simulations of both the  and mark iii datasets (   [ sec : eval_mock ] ; kolatt 1996 ) allows much better error analysis in both the peculiar velocity and density fields , and in the comparison .",
    "we use these simulations to assess biases in our determination of @xmath10 .",
    "unlike pi93 , these biases turn out to be negligible , allowing us to sidestep the rather elaborate likelihood analysis of that paper .",
    "indeed , we will use the simulations themselves as a guide to whether our data are statistically consistent with the null hypothesis of gi and linear biasing .",
    "we also use them to quantify the statistical errors in our final results .",
    "the current analysis compares the density fields smoothed with a gaussian window of radius @xmath0 , where the fluctuations are of order unity and therefore require a mildly nonlinear treatment .",
    "the potent analysis computes the density field @xmath28 , a generalization of @xmath30 that is a nonlinear function of @xmath12 and the spatial partial derivatives of the observed @xmath31 ( equation  [ eq : delc+ ] ) .",
    "the  reconstruction , in turn , yields a mildly nonlinear galaxy density field , @xmath29 , that is a weak function of @xmath12 and @xmath4  only via the corrections from redshift space to real space ( equations  [ [ eq : cz - r ] ] and [ [ eq : v = int_over_x ] ] ) .",
    "equation is thus replaced by @xmath32 the @xmath12 dependence of equation  ( [ eq : gi+b ] ) is already included in @xmath28 .",
    "the density fields are recovered from the data for assumed values of @xmath12 and @xmath4 .",
    "then , @xmath4 is determined by , and @xmath10 is quoted .",
    "the analysis is carried out for several initial values of @xmath12 and @xmath4 to confirm the robustness of the estimate of @xmath10 .",
    "the present work is less ambitious than pi93 in one respect .",
    "an attempt was made in pi93 to use the nonlinear effects to break the degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath12 , but with only limited success .",
    "the resulting constraints on each parameter separately were quite weak , indicating that the nonlinear effects associated with these data are not sufficient for this purpose . even with the new data , the nonlinear effects are comparable to the errors that accompany the reconstructions .",
    "furthermore , if we are to consider nonlinear gravity , we should also allow nonlinear extensions to the biasing relation , , but in practice , it is not clear how to distinguish nonlinear gravity effects from nonlinear biasing effects .",
    "we therefore limit ourselves in this paper to determining the degenerate combination @xmath10 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in   [ sec : potent ] we discuss the potent reconstruction of the mass - density field from peculiar velocities , and in ",
    "[ sec : iras ] the reconstruction of the galaxy density field from the  redshift survey . in ",
    "[ sec : eval ] we use mock catalogs to evaluate the random and systematic errors in the reconstructed density fields , and to minimize them if possible . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe our method of comparison of the two fields , and estimate the systematic and random errors in the measurement of @xmath10 . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we perform the comparison of the real data , evaluate goodness of fit , and determine the value of @xmath10 . in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] we conclude with the implications of our results and compare them with other recent determinations of @xmath10 .",
    "the potent procedure recovers the underlying mass - density fluctuation field from a whole - sky sample of observed radial peculiar velocities .",
    "the steps involved are : ( a ) preparing the data for potent analysis , including grouping and correcting for malmquist bias , ( b ) smoothing the peculiar velocities into a uniformly - smoothed radial velocity field with minimum bias , ( c ) applying the ansatz of gravitating potential flow to recover the potential and three - dimensional velocity field , and ( d ) deriving the underlying density field @xmath28 by an approximation to gi in the mildly nonlinear regime . the revised potent method , which grew out of the original method of dekel , bertschinger & faber ( 1990 , dbf ) , is described in detail in dekel ( 1997 ) and is reviewed in the context of other methods by dekel ( 1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "we emphasize below the important improvements since pi93 .",
    "we use the most comprehensive catalog of peculiar velocity data available today , the mark iii catalog ( willick 1995 , 1996 , 1997a ) , which is a careful compilation of several data sets of spiral and elliptical galaxies under the assumption that all galaxies trace the same underlying velocity field . the non - trivial procedure of merging the data sets accounts for differences in the selection criteria , the quantities measured , the method of measurement and the tf calibration techniques .",
    "the data per galaxy consist of a redshift @xmath33 , a ",
    "forward \" tf ( or @xmath34 ) inferred distance , @xmath35 , and an error .",
    "the radial peculiar velocity is then @xmath36 .",
    "the mark ii data used in pi93 consisted of about 1000 galaxies ( mostly ellipticals by lynden - bell 1988 and spirals by aaronson 1982 ) .",
    "the extended mark iii catalog consists of @xmath27 galaxies , including the mark ii data ( with improvements to the uniformity of aaronson 1982 by tormen & burstein 1995 ) as well as newer spiral data sets by courteau ( 1992 ) , willick ( 1991 ) , mathewson , ford , & buchhorn ( 1992 ) , and han & mould ( 1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "this sample enables a reasonable recovery of the dynamical fields with @xmath0 smoothing in a sphere of radius @xmath37 about the local group ( lg ) .      even after the selection bias in the tf calibration",
    "is properly corrected , the inferred distance @xmath35 for a given galaxy , and therefore its peculiar velocity , suffer from a malmquist bias due to the cross - talk between the random distance errors and the distribution of galaxies about @xmath35 .",
    "we correct this bias in a statistical way before using the velocities as input to potent .",
    "if the scatter around the tf relation is gaussian ( willick 1997a ) , i.e. , the absolute magnitude @xmath38 is distributed normally for a given log - linewidth @xmath39 with standard deviation @xmath40 , then the forward inferred distance of a galaxy at a true distance @xmath41 is distributed log - normally about @xmath41 , with relative error @xmath42 .",

    "the deviation of @xmath45 from @xmath35 is the bias .",
    "the homogeneous part ( @xmath46 constant ) , which arises from the three - dimensionality of space , reduces to @xmath47 , and thus is easy to correct .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath44 are responsible for the inhomogeneous malmquist bias ( i m ) , which , if uncorrected , will systematically enhance the inferred density perturbations @xmath28 , and thus the deduced value of @xmath21 .",
    "the galaxies are first grouped in @xmath33-space ( willick 1996 ) , reducing the distance error of each group and thus weakening the bias .",
    "the inferred distance of each object is then replaced by @xmath45 , with an assumed @xmath44 properly corrected for grouping and for redshift cutoffs in the data .",
    "we use high - resolution density fields of  and optical galaxies ( hudson 1993 ) for the required input @xmath44 for spirals and ellipticals respectively .",
    "tests with mock data demonstrated that the i m bias can be reduced to the level of a few percent in @xmath28 ( dekel 1997 ; eldar , dekel & willick 1997 ) .",
    "the resultant correction to @xmath28 is less than @xmath48 even at the highest peaks , and is much smaller throughout most of space .",
    "thus , the use of  data for the i m correction of the mark iii data introduces only a weak coupling to the potent output density field . for the purpose of this paper , the potent and   density fields",
    "can thus be regarded as essentially independent data sets . indeed , a different i m correction procedure in the framework of an  inverse \" tf analysis , which does not rely on external input for @xmath44 , yields a density field that is consistent with the result of the forward analysis applied here ( dekel 1997 ; eldar , dekel & willick 1997 ; following landy & szalay 1992 ) .",
    "the goal of the potent analysis is to use the set of radial peculiar velocities @xmath49 at positions @xmath50 to determine the underlying continuous fields @xmath31 and @xmath51 , both smoothed with a gaussian of radius @xmath52 .",
    "we denote hereafter a 3d gaussian smoothing window of radius @xmath53 by g@xmath53 , such that @xmath0 smoothing is indicated by g12 , and so on .",
    "the first , most difficult step is the smoothing , or interpolation , into a continuous radial velocity field @xmath54 . the goal is minimum bias compared to the radial component of the true field , had it been sampled noiselessly , densely and uniformly , and perfectly smoothed in 3d . the radial velocity field at @xmath55",

    "the window is a gaussian , modified such that it minimizes the combined effect of the following three types of errors .",
    "_ tensor window bias .",
    "_ because the radial peculiar velocity vectors are not parallel , the @xmath49 s can not be averaged as scalars , and @xmath61 requires a fit of a local 3d velocity model .",
    "the potent version of dbf used the simplest local model with three parameters , @xmath62 for which the solution can be expressed explicitly in terms of a tensor window function .",
    "however , a bias occurs because the tensorial correction to the spherical window has conical symmetry , and because variations of @xmath63 within the window , such as a spherical infall pattern , may be interpreted erroneously as a local bulk velocity .",
    "this bias amounts to @xmath64 at the great attractor ( see below ) .",
    "the window bias can be reduced by introducing shear into the model , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a symmetric tensor that automatically ensures local irrotationality .",

    "this implies that the velocity field can be derived from a scalar potential , @xmath78 , and thus the potential can be computed by integration along the lines of sight , @xmath79 the two missing transverse velocity components are then recovered by differentiation .",
    "the subsequent derivation of the underlying mass - density fluctuation field requires a solution to the equations of gi in the mildly nonlinear regime .",
    "the linear approximation is limited to the small dynamical range between a few tens of megaparsecs and the @xmath80 extent of the current samples .",
    "our current peculiar velocity samples enable us to perform reliable dynamical analyses with a smoothing radius as small as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 reaches values larger than unity and therefore nonlinear effects play a role .",
    "we appeal to the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approximation , which is known to be a successful tool in the mildly nonlinear regime . substituting an eulerian version of the zeldovich approximation in the continuity equation yields ( nusser 1991 ) @xmath83 where the bars denote",

    "since we have included mildly nonlinear corrections both in the potent and the  analyses , we may expect the actual relation between @xmath28 and @xmath29 to deviate slightly from the linear relation .",
    "what we have done , in fact , was to assume @xmath6 in the potent reconstruction ( and , less importantly , @xmath182 in the conversion from redshift to real space ) , and then determine @xmath4 [ and thus @xmath265 from the best fit line of @xmath28 versus @xmath29 .",
    "the fact that we ended up with a value of @xmath10 that is consistent at the @xmath266 level with the assumed value of unity indicates that this is a self - consistent solution for @xmath12 and @xmath4 near unity .    in order to validate our result for the more general case of @xmath267 where @xmath12 and @xmath4 may differ from unity",
    ", one should redo the @xmath85-body simulation of the mock catalogs for values of @xmath268 . in the present paper",
    ", we estimate the errors for @xmath269 by scaling the errors determined from the @xmath6 simulation .",
    "we first redo the comparison analysis in the standard volume with assumed values of @xmath270 and @xmath271 , which also correspond to @xmath272 .",
    "this makes a difference mostly in the potent reconstruction .",
    "we crudely scale the errors @xmath154 in proportion to @xmath273 . for this case",
    "we obtain @xmath274 from our fit to the real data in our standard volume .",
    "the quoted error is now only a rough estimate based on the increase in @xmath275 .",
    "this result is consistent with the value @xmath263 , obtained in our standard case of @xmath182 .",
    "this confirms our assessment that we are indeed measuring @xmath10 , and are not very sensitive to the actual values of @xmath12 and @xmath4 that give rise to that value of @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we try two cases where the assumed @xmath10 is @xmath276 rather than unity .",
    "when we start with @xmath6 and @xmath277 , we obtain @xmath278 .",
    "when we start with @xmath270 and @xmath279 , we obtain @xmath280 where the error is roughly scaled as before . in both cases ,",
    "the resultant @xmath10 are significantly larger than the  assumed \" value of @xmath281 .",
    "this test demonstrates that the result is not determined by the assumed input and the method is discriminatory ; we can rule out low values of @xmath282 .",
    "note , however , that the rejection of the case @xmath277 is stronger than the rejection of the case @xmath270 , because the  errors become larger when @xmath12 is lower .",
    "the above tests strengthen our confidence in the generality of our result from the standard case , of @xmath283 .",
    "however , the error estimate of @xmath284 is strictly valid only near @xmath285 . if @xmath12 is lower , the error is expected to be larger .",
    "the calibration of the method and the error estimate can be fine - tuned further using full potent and  reconstructions from mock catalogs drawn from simulations with different values of @xmath12 and @xmath4 , which is work in progress . however , since we have no reason to suspect any significant change in the result , we defer this further testing to a subsequent paper .",
    "we have compared the density of mass and light as reconstructed from the mark iii catalog of peculiar velocities and the  1.2 jy redshift survey , with gaussian smoothing of @xmath0 and within volumes of effective radii @xmath1 .",
    "our two main conclusions are :    * the data are consistent with gravitational instability theory in the mildly nonlinear regime and a linear biasing relation between galaxies and mass on these large scales . *",
    "the value of the corresponding @xmath21 parameter at this smoothing scale is @xmath286 .",
    "the relative robustness of this value to changes in the comparison volume suggests that the cosmic scatter is no greater than @xmath5 .",
    "this result is consistent with the simplest cosmological model of an einstein  de sitter universe ( @xmath6 , @xmath287 ) with unbiased  galaxies , and it also permits somewhat lower values of @xmath12 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , values as low as @xmath288 would require large - scale anti - biasing of @xmath289 ( with 95% confidence )  a phenomenon that is not easily reproduced in theoretical simulations ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1992 ; evrard , summers , & davis 1994 ) .",
    "although our analysis uses an extension of the zeldovich approximation , we have not tried to directly measure nonlinear effects in these data to break the degeneracy between @xmath12 and @xmath4 : the effects are weak ( pi93 ) , and are of the same order as possible nonlinearities in the biasing relation .",
    "an interesting area for future work is to see if we can put an _ upper _ limit on the degree of nonlinearity ; if we can , this puts a lower limit on @xmath4 , and therefore a lower limit on @xmath12 .    as explained in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the current analysis is a significantly improved version of the pi93 analysis done with the earlier mark ii and  1.936 jy data , and of the hudson ( 1995 ) comparison to optical galaxies .",
    "the result of pi93 was @xmath24 at 95% confidence .",
    "the new result is lower , but only by about @xmath290 .",
    "the current analysis is superior in many respects .",
    "the improvements in the data include denser sampling of a larger volume , a careful procedure of selection , calibration and merging of the tf data sets , and a better correction for malmquist bias .",
    "the methods of reconstruction were considerably improved , using new techniques and with extensive testing and error analysis using realistic mock catalogs drawn from simulations .",
    "the optimization of the comparison method using the mock catalogs led to an unbiased estimate of @xmath21 with well - defined statistical errors .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 has been measured using a variety of techniques from observational data sets ( as discussed in the references in   [ sec : intro ] ) ; we here discuss other estimates of @xmath10 from the mark iii and  1.2 jy data .",
    "estimates of @xmath10 from _ redshift distortions _ in redshift surveys are almost all within 2@xmath26 of our current result ( peacock & dodds 1994 , @xmath291 ; fisher 1994b , @xmath292 ; fisher , sharf , & lahav 1994c , @xmath293 ; cole , fisher , & weinberg 1995 , @xmath294 ; hamilton 1995 , @xmath295 ; heavens & taylor 1995 , @xmath296 ; fisher & nusser 1996 , @xmath297 ) .",
    "the scatter between these results is mostly due to differences in method of analysis , but cosmic scatter , nonlinear effects , and complications in the biasing scheme probably also play a role .",
    "our current analysis is a comparison at the density level ( a @xmath298 comparison ) .",
    "alternative analyses that performed the comparison at the _ velocity _ level ( @xmath299 comparisons ) typically yielded somewhat lower values for @xmath10 , ranging from @xmath300 to @xmath301 : ( strauss 1989 , @xmath302 ; kaiser 1991 , @xmath303 ; roth 1994 , @xmath304 ; nusser & davis 1994 , @xmath305 ; davis 1997 , @xmath305 ; willick 1997b , @xmath306 ) .",
    "we focus here on the two most recent and sophisticated analyses of the @xmath299 type , termed itf and velmod .",
    "the itf analysis ( davis 1997 ) is a mode - by - mode comparison of velocity - field models , based on expansion in spherical harmonics and radial bessel functions , that were fitted in redshift space to a processed version of the inverse tf data from the mark iii catalog and the  1.2 jy redshift survey .",
    "the itf analysis finds a poor fit between the velocity fields and the model , in the form of a distance - dependent dipole at large distances , in apparent contrast with the good fit obtained here .",
    "one possible explanation for this difference is an error in one of the large - scale velocity fields , or both , that does not propagate to their local derivatives , the density fields .",
    "a differential offset in the zero point of the tf relation between data sets of the mark iii catalog , which generates an artificial coherent bulk motion , is one such possibility .",
    "an inaccurate definition of the local group frame in the   reconstruction , or missing density data beyond the sampled volume , are other possible sources of error in the velocities .",
    "another source of error is the somewhat arbitrary adjustments that had to be made to the mark iii data sets when combining them into one system for the itf analysis ( cf . , the discussion in davis 1997 ) .",
    "if one ignores the poor fit , the itf analysis yields the formal estimate @xmath297 , @xmath307 lower than our current result .",
    "the local nature of the density - density comparison , and the resulting better goodness of fit , argue that it may provide a more reliable estimate of @xmath10 .",
    "the velmod analysis ( willick 1997b ) is a high - resolution @xmath299 comparison at a small smoothing scale of @xmath308 , using about one quarter of the mark iii data within a volume of radius @xmath309 , and applying a sophisticated likelihood analysis in the linear regime .",
    "the comparison revealed a good fit and an estimate of @xmath310 .",
    "we can see several possible reasons for the difference in the estimates of @xmath10 .",
    "it is possible that the difference originates from systematic errors that were somehow overlooked despite the successful testing using the same mock catalogs .",
    "for example , the velmod analysis assumes pure linear theory , and may thus suffer from nonlinear effects that were not taken into account .",
    "in fact , it was never fully understood how the linear analysis of velmod did well at g3 smoothing where nonlinear effects are expected to be important .",
    "one suspicion is that the mock simulation is too smooth on small scales .",
    "another source for the difference may be the partial data used in the velmod comparison , where the comparison is in fact dominated by data within @xmath311 .",
    "the difference in @xmath10 can thus partly reflect cosmic scatter in @xmath4 or in the local effective @xmath12 .",
    "table  1 shows that @xmath10 increases by an insignificant @xmath312 from the smallest to the largest comparison volume ; the velmod analysis also found no statistically significant growth of @xmath10 with scale .",
    "this allows us to put an upper limit on the cosmic scatter of order 0.1 .",
    "finally , a possible explanation for the difference in @xmath10 is _ scale dependence _ of the biasing relation between gaussian smoothings of @xmath313 and @xmath0 , which would be associated with non - linear biasing .",
    "some support for such a trend is found by the simpot analysis ( nusser & dekel 1997 ) , which fits a parametric model of velocity and density fields and @xmath21 simultaneously to the peculiar velocity and redshift data ( a @xmath314 comparison ) .",
    "this analysis yields @xmath315 for g12 smoothing , and lower values of @xmath10 for smaller smoothing scales , in qualitative agreement with the comparison of the results of the current paper and of velmod .",
    "current theoretical simulations indicate possible scale dependence in the biasing relation between scales of one to a few megaparsecs ( , kauffman 1997 ; cf .",
    ", mo & white 1996 ) , but it remains to be seen whether such a trend can arise on scales of @xmath316 to @xmath0 .",
    "the biasing scheme , which could be nontrivial in several ways ( see dekel & lahav 1997 ) , is clearly a bottle - neck in the effort to measure the cosmological parameter @xmath12 via @xmath21  the biasing is inevitably involved whenever galaxy - density data are used .",
    "the largest source of error in this analysis lies in the peculiar velocity data , and thus improved peculiar velocity datasets , with better control of systematic errors , denser sampling , and more complete sky coverage , will be of great importance for this work ( cf . , the reviews of strauss 1997a ; giovanelli 1997 )",
    ". it will be interesting to make the comparison of the potent maps with the optical redshift data of santiago ( 1995 , 1996 ) , although a proper calculation of the errors in the optical density field will be somewhat more difficult .",
    "finally , more work lies ahead in testing the robustness of our results to the assumed value of @xmath12 ( see the discussion in   [ sec : results_beta ] ) , and carrying out the analysis at other smoothing lengths to look for nonlinear effects .",
