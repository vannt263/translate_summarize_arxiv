    "the principal aim of such surveys for distant , x - ray emitting clusters is to determine their space density evolution as a function of redshift and to constrain the combination of the root mean square mass density fluctuations on 8@xmath3 mpc scales , @xmath4 , and the overall matter density of the universe expressed as fraction of the closure density , @xmath5 ( e.g. borgani et al . 2001 ; schuecker et al .",

    "potential uncertainties associated with the velocity dispersion values presented in this paper are discussed in section [ sec_clsprop ] . however , in the overwhelming majority of clusters observed in detail , the integrated velocity dispersion profile of galaxy clusters is a _ decreasing _ function of projected radius from the cluster centre ( girardi et al .",
    "1996 ; borgani et al . 1999 ) . if the integrated velocity dispersion profiles of the xmm ",
    "lss clusters presented in this paper display similar behaviour to hotter clusters , then the expectation arising from computation of the cluster velocity at some fraction of the convergent radius is that the velocity dispersion will be overestimated and will result in values of @xmath55 biased to higher values .",
    "the extent of any such bias is difficult to quantify in the current data set .",
    "however , the implication is that the value of @xmath55 displayed in figure [ bspec_vs_lx ] would not increase with the addition of velocity dispersion measurements extending to larger radii .",
    "the low values of @xmath55 apparent in figure [ bspec_vs_lx ] , are similar to those seen by op04 in lower luminosity groups ( @xmath65 ergs s@xmath20 ) at low redshift . the origin of these low values of @xmath55 is far from clear , but op04 argue that it appears to result primarily from a reduction in @xmath57 , rather than an enhancement in @xmath34 .",
    "whatever the cause , our results provide tentative evidence that these effects are operating in hotter and more x  ray luminous systems at higher redshift .",
    "we are currently in the process of conducting magnitude limited spectroscopy of a sample of @xmath66  kev systems at @xmath67 in order to provide a more robust picture of the dynamics of low temperature x  ray systems .",
    "we have presented twelve newly identified x  ray selected groups and clusters as part of the xmm large  scale structure survey .",
    "the procedures employed to detect and classify sources in x  rays , and to subsequently confirm each source via optical imaging and spectroscopic observations have been described in detail .",
    "we have emphasized throughout this paper that the current sample of clusters is not complete in any statistical sense .",
    "the presentation of a larger , complete sample of x  ray clusters located at @xmath16 will form part of a future publication .",
    "however , the current sample of x - ray clusters at @xmath16 presents a number of interesting features : most importantly , the sample is dominated by low x  ray temperature systems located at redshifts much greater than that presented by previous x  ray studies .",
    "such systems are predicted to display the effects of pre  heating or additional energy input into the icm to a greater extent than hotter , more massive systems .",
    "the identification of such low  temperature systems at look  back times up to 5.7 gyr provides an important baseline over which to study the extent to which such systems evolve .",
    "we find tentative evidence that these high redshift groups are more luminous than local systems , at a given temperature , in agreement with recent work on richer clusters .",
    "however , our results suggest that group luminosities may be evolving less rapidly than higher temperature clusters when compared to self - similar models .",
    "if this is confirmed to be the case , then the steepening of the @xmath33-@xmath34 relation at low temperatures reported in local samples , may continue at higher redshift .",
    "we also find preliminary indications that the poorly understood tendency for the specific energy in the gas to exceed that in the galaxies in poor groups , extends to systems with higher values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 at @xmath68 .",
    "the completion of a larger and statistically complete sample of intermediate redshift groups from the xmm  lss survey , should allow these results to be placed on a firm statistical footing in the near future .",

    "the current study extends x  ray spectral observations of distant galaxy groups and clusters to low integrated signal levels ( @xmath69 photons above the background).it is therefore prudent to assess the reliability of temperature measures and associated uncertainties computed via model fits to such faint spectra by repeating the fitting procedure for a grid of simulated spectra created to reproduce the properties of the observed sample .",

    "the instrumental response was modeled using the redistribution matrix and ancillary response files from observations of xlssc 006 .",
    "a model pn @xmath72 mos1 @xmath72 mos2 spectra was created and a conversion factor applied to generate spectra of the required integrated count level over the spectral interval [ 0.310 ]  kev in a 10,000 second exposure .",
    "each simulated spectrum is generated from this model using poissonian considerations .",
    "each source spectrum is accompanied by a background spectrum created from a poisson realisation of a background model of normalisation and shape consistent with observed cluster backgrounds .",

    ", 50 spectra were simulated at each point of a grid of integrated count levels @xmath74 .",
    "spectral fitting follows the same approach as applied to observed data , i.e. temperature and spectum normalisation are permitted to vary while the abundance is fixed .",
    "data from pn @xmath72 mos1 @xmath72 mos2 are are combined within xspec with the response files from xlssc 006 and the energy range [ 0.310 ]  kev is conserved .",
    "the spectral energy range corresponding to [ 7.58.5 ]  kev measured by the pn detector is ignored as it contains strong instrumental line emission that is not well corrected by our data modeling process . the best ",
    "fitting model is then determind by minimising a modified c ",
    "statistic and the @xmath75 uncertainty about the best fit model is computed .",
    "while the c  statistic is intended to work efficiently on unbinned data a comparison of the fitted temperature to the input value indicates a tendency to underestimate the temperature of spectra of input temperatures @xmath76  kev displaying count values @xmath77 counts using this procedure .",
    "this bias is indicated in figure [ tempsim ] and appears to arise from the fact that the statistic used in xspec represents a modified c  statistic that accounts for statistical fluctuations in the background estimation .",
    "our understanding of the problem is that this modified statistic fails at estimating model parameters when there is a significant number of background bins containing zero photons .",
    "resampling the data to prevent the occurence of spectral bins containing zero counts minimises this negative temperature bias .",
    "the resampling factor is determined by requiring that the background spectrum associated with each source display a specified minimum count level per spectral bin .",
    "determining the resampling factor from the background spectrum represents a sensible approach as the background counts are more numerous and therefore minimise the loss of spectral information in the source spectrum .",
    "although a small positive bias is introduced to the fitted temperatures of very low count level spectra ( @xmath78 counts ) when the data are resampled , the amplitude of this bias is less than 10%  when the data are resampled to contain 5 counts per spectral bin ( figure [ tempsim ] ) . applying a larger resampling factor increases the positive temperature bias  which can be understood in terms of the spectral smoothing that the resampling procedure represents .",
    "we therefore resample the observed data to generate a background spectrum containing 5 counts per spectral bin .",
    "this approach generates fitted temperatures that agree with the input temperature to @xmath79% .",
    "in addition , comparison of the distribution of fitted temperatures at any given combination of temperature and count level to the temperature uncertainty returned by xspec indicates that the xspec quoted errors on fitted temperatures overestimate the distribution of fitted temperatures by a factor typically less than 2 .",
    "due to the various assumptions that enter the simulation procedure it therefore seems reaonable to provide xspec quoted temperature uncertainties as a conservative error estimate ."
