    "the next step is to compute a dft of this light curve which will look really noisy .",

    "three cases are reported in bibliography ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) : a ) anticorrelation , which indicates that the rv variations are due to stellar activity ( by active regions at the stellar surface like spots or plages ) , b ) lack of correlation , which indicates the doppler reflex motion around the center of mass due to other bodies orbiting the star , c ) correlation , which , as pointed out by martinez - fiorenzano et al .",

    "[ fig : bis ] , there is an anticorrelation between bis and rv , with a pearson correlation coefficient ( @xmath89 ) of -0.6851 .",
    "this result suggests that the rv variations of fr  cnc are due to stellar activity variations ( e.g. spots on photosphere ) and not due to a binary nature .",
    "when the spectrum of the standard star was broadened to the same rotational velocity of fr  cnc , the profiles of the ccf became smoother and could be fitted with a gaussian profile , ( see fig .  [",

    "these irregularities may come from photospheric activity features on the stellar surface .",
    "they can distort the profile of the photospheric lines and induce variations in the peak of the ccf .",
    "however , this behavior may be caused by the difference in rotational velocity ( @xmath6  sin  @xmath7 ) between the target and standard star ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ) when the standard is a much slower rotator than the target .",

    "in addition , there is a tendency for spots close to the equator ( @xmath12420 ) to be reconstructed at slightly higher latitudes than they are physically situated .",

    "lightcurve data alone does not contain sufficient information to make reliable images of single stars .",
    "any complex spot structure or spot groups will be rendered simply as a single spot .",

    "allowing the photometric fit to more closely match the observed lightcurve results in a slightly poorer fit to the spectroscopic data .",

    "as expected , the anticorrelation is still seen , but here we have a strongest pearson correlation coefficient of r = -0.8992 .    as might be expected for such an active star , fr  cnc exhibits a high degree of spot coverage .",
    "no spots are visible in the phase range 0.10.3 .",
    "this agrees well with the photometric @xmath11-band light curve plotted for the same period ( fig .",
    "[ asas_phase ] , 20032004 ) which shows a maximum at phase @xmath127 .",
    "this contrast with a significant degree of spotness at other longitudes is likely responsible for the high degree of photometrical modulation seen in this star .",
    "the starspot distribution of fr  cnc is also of interest since it is one of the latest spectral types to have been imaged .",
    "comparison with the k5v rapid rotator lo peg , @xcite , shows a significantly different spot distribution . while lo peg rotates more rapidly",
    "( @xmath6  sin  @xmath7 = 65.9 km  s@xmath9 ) , showing predominantly mid - high latitude spot structures and a polar spot , fr  cnc shows only mid - latitude starspots .",

    "we have carried out a photometric , polarimetric and spectroscopic study of fr  cnc .",
    "optical @xmath28-band photometry was carried out during 2007 march  2008 february at terskol branch of the astronomy institute ( russia ) .",
    "there are no peculiar features in the 2008 light curve , while in the 2007 photometry two brightening episodes were detected .",
    "one of them occurred at the same phase as the flare of november 23 , 2006 ( phase = @xmath130 ) and probably indicates that both of these events ( i.e. the flare on november 23 , 2006 and the photometric brightening episode ) originated from the same long - living active region on fr  cnc .",
    "the non - detection of any other flares in our photometry except 2006 november 23 implies that fr  cnc has a low frequency of flares .",
    "we analysed _",
    "photometry obtained in 20022008 in @xmath11-band .",
    "no evidence of flares in _",
    "_ data were found .",
    "the profiles of variability are different from season to season .",
    "the mean magnitude in @xmath11-band remained the same ( @xmath131 mag ) during 20022008 , while the amplitude decreased abruptly in 2005 .",
    "the proposed interpretation is a redistribution of spots / spot groups over the surface of the star , while the total percentage of the spotted area was assumed to be constant within the error limits . a detailed periodogram study of the _ asas-3 _",
    "photometric data enabled us to derive a more accurate value for the period of fr  cnc .",
    "we find that @xmath132 d. in addition , we also presented @xmath133 photometric calibration of 166 stars in fr  cnc vicinity , whose @xmath11-magnitude is in the range of @xmath134@xmath135 mag .    the @xmath3 broad - band polarimetric observations of fr  cnc have been obtained at aries in nainital ( india ) at manora peak .",
    "the observed polarization in @xmath28-band is well matched with the theoretical values expected for zeeman polarization model .",
    "however , the observed polarization in @xmath11 and @xmath136 bands slightly exceeds the theoretical values and thompson and rayleigh scattering from inhomogeneous regions are not enough to explain the observed polarization excess .",
    "therefore the excess of linear polarization should come from an additional source of polarization .",
    "taking into account that we conclude that fr  cnc is not a binary , the mechanism which can produce additional linear polarization is probably scattering in circumstellar material distributed in an asymmetric geometry ( e.g. see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 58 spectra of fr  cnc , which have been obtained in 20042008 , were analysed in this work . based on our spectroscopic observations ,",
    "fr  cnc was classified as k7v star .",
    "rv analysis supports the single nature of fr  cnc .",
    "anticorrelation between bis and rv also indicates that the rv variations are due to stellar activity variations and not due to a secondary companion .",
    "the kinematics study , based on obtained galactic space - velocity components ( @xmath4 ) of fr  cnc , shows that this star clearly lies in the young disc population velocity space and might also belong to ic 2391 moving group , although the eggen kinematic criteria shows that fr  cnc may not be a member of any mg in the young disc area .",
    "the li  i @xmath56707.8 averaged @xmath106 measured is 34 m , giving the spectral type of fr  cnc , it is in agreement with being a young object between 10120 myr .",
    "the h@xmath24 line was always observed above the continuum in all the obtained spectra . measuring the @xmath106 of this line",
    ", we found that the h@xmath24 emission @xmath106 average in every season is quite different . in 2004 , as with the photometry , spectroscopic indicators of chromospheric activity show a high level of activity which decreased in 2005 .",
    "the ca  ii ( irt ) is included in our echelle spectra . from the ratio of excess emission @xmath106 we found that in fr  cnc",
    ", ca  ii emission comes from plage - like regions .",
    "we noticed that fr  cnc can show an activity cycle of 4 - 5 years , although further follow up will confirm this periodicity .    since fr  cnc is a rapid rotator , we generated an indirect starspot map using the doppler tomography of stars imaging code . from it",
    "we derive @xmath6  sin  @xmath7 = @xmath137 km  s@xmath9 and @xmath138 .",
    "fr  cnc belongs to one of the latest spectral types to have been imaged with the doppler tomography .",
    "we independently estimated a rotational velocity of fr  cnc during our observations using queloz method ( sect .",
    "5.3 ) and by the d.i",
    ". fits ( sect .",
    "although they are differences in the results of the two methods , they are consistent . in table [ tab : par ] we have put as the rotational velocity of fr  cnc , the value obtained in the d.i . as it is likely more accurate .    despite the short rotation period and its late spectral type , fr  cnc shows very few flare events .",
    "it shows high level of activity as it is a young star , but an unusually short variability due to the redistribution of activity features on the stellar surface .",
    "while this variability is reflected in the changes of the amplitude of brightness , the mean brightness permanently is nearly constant , indicating that the percentage of stellar surface covered by spots is also constant .",
    "the spots location is also unusual , not showing a polar spot like other f  k stars do but a distribution more resembling those seen in m1m2 dwarfs .",
    "although this may be indicative of a distributed dynamo , the mid - high latitude spot locations are more suggestive of an interface dynamo under the action of rapid rotation .",
    "we can only speculate as to whether fr  cnc is representative of a regime in which a convective - shell - type dynamo gives way to a fully convective dynamo .",
    "polarimetric observations of the magnetic field by @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) for example suggest that this occurs at a later spectral type of m4 , whereas other chromospheric indicators show no obvious changes until later m spectral types ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "further spectroscopy with a higher cadence would enable more detailed maps to be derived , with multiple epochs enabling the evolution of starspots to be investigated .",
