    "pulsating da ( h - rich atmospheres ) white dwarfs , also known as zz ceti or dav variable stars , comprise the most numerous and studied class of degenerate pulsators .",
    "their instability strip , probably a pure one , is centered at an effective temperature of around @xmath3 k ( winget & kepler 2008 ; fontaine & brassard 2008 ; althaus et al .",
    "2010a ) . the luminosity variations ( of up to @xmath4 mag )",
    "are caused by nonradial @xmath1-mode pulsations of low degree ( @xmath5 ) and periods between @xmath6 and @xmath7 s , excited through a combination of the @xmath8 mechanism acting in the hydrogen partial ionization zone ( dolez & vauclair 1981 ; winget et al .",
    "1982 ) and the `` convective driving '' mechanism  once a sufficiently thick outer convective zone has been developed ( brickhill 1991 ; goldreich & wu 1999 ) .",
    "zz ceti asteroseismology  the comparison between the observed periods and the periods computed for a suite of representative stellar models  has the potential of disentangle the internal structure of da white dwarfs , allowing to place constraints on the stellar mass , the thickness of the outer envelopes , the core chemical composition , weak magnetic fields and slow rotation rates from the observed period patterns ( winget & kepler 2008 ; fontaine & brassard 2008 ; althaus et al .",
    "2010a ) .",
    "a total of 148 zz ceti stars are currently known ( castanheira et al . 2010 ) . to this list",
    "we must add the recently discovered dav star wd j191643.83@xmath0393849.7 ( _ kepler _ i d 4552982 hereinafter wd j1916@xmath03938 ) , a zz ceti located in the _ kepler _ mission field and identified through ground - based times series photometry ( hermes et al .",
    "2011 ; hereinafter hea11 ) .",
    "this star ( @xmath9 k ; @xmath10 ) exhibits low - amplitude luminosity variations with periods between @xmath11 and @xmath12 s ( see column 2 of table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "it is expected that an extended monitoring of this object with _ kepler _ could bring the best lightcurve of a pulsating white dwarf ever recorded ( hea11 ) , even with a better quality than the lightcurves of the brighter stars observed through uninterrupted ground - based campaigns of the whole earth telescope ( wet ; nather et al .",
    "1990 ) .    in order for white dwarf asteroseismology to provide realistic constraints on the internal structure of white dwarfs ,",
    "it is crucial the use of stellar models characterised by consistent and detailed chemical profiles to accurately assess the adiabatic pulsation periods .",
    "this requirement has been tackled successfully in the case of the hot dovs or gw vir stars ( see crsico et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b , 2008 , 2009 ) . very recently ,",
    "romero et al . (",
    "2011 ) have performed the first asteroseismological analysis of a set of 44 zz ceti stars based on the new generation of fully evolutionary da white dwarf models presented in althaus et al .",
    "( 2010b ) .",
    "these models are characterised by realistic chemical profiles throughout the star and cover a wide range of stellar masses , thicknesses of the h envelope and effective temperatures .",
    "the analysis of a large number of zz ceti stars has the potential to characterise the global properties of the class , in particular the thicknesses of the h envelope and the stellar masses .",
    "the study of romero et al .",
    "( 2011 ) revealed that da white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood could harbor a broad range of h - layer thickness . on the other hand , this analysis was successful in finding , for the first time , an univocal asteroseismological model for the archetypal zz ceti star g117@xmath13b15a , one of the targets of that analysis .",
    "motivated by the exciting discovery of the first pulsating da white dwarf in the field of the _ kepler _ mission , and encouraged by the availability of the most complete set of detailed evolutionary and pulsation models for dav stars up to date ( romero et al 2011 ) , we present in this paper a first asteroseismological analysis of wd j1916@xmath03938 .",
    "we are well aware that the asteroseismological potential of this pulsating star will probably be fully exploited with further observations by _ kepler _ , which will allow to have available a period spectrum substantially richer than that we have at hand at present just from ground - based photometry .",
    "however , we think that a first asteroseismological analysis of this star based on the seven periods  a representative number of periods for zz ceti standards  currently available is worth being attempted . by considering the mean period spacing exhibited by the star",
    ", we found that wd j1916@xmath03938 should be substantially massive , in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic inference .",
    "we also found that period - to - period fits favour an asteroseismological model characterised by a high stellar mass , a low effective temperature , and a rather thin h envelope .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the computer codes and stellar models employed .",
    "the short section [ smd ] is devoted to the derivation of the spectroscopic mass of wd j1916@xmath03938 .",
    "we make inferences about the stellar mass from the period spacing data in section [ period - spacing ] , taking into account its dependence not only with the effective temperature and mass , but instead also with the thickness of the h envelope . in section [ period - fit ]",
    "we extract information of the star through asteroseismological period fits .",
    "section [ rotation ] is devoted to infer a rotation period of the star . finally , we enumerate our results in the conclusions ( section [ conclu ] ) .",
    ".the observed frequencies , periods , and amplitudes of wd j1916@xmath03938 ( columns 1 to 3 ) , according to hea11 , and the periods of a phenomenological model ( see section [ period - spacing ] ) with a fixed ( @xmath14 ) period spacing of @xmath15 s ( columns 4 to 6 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]    next , we tried to find a best - fit model by discarding the period at 834.1 s ( so , @xmath16 ) , to be consistent with the assumption made to derive a mean period spacing of the star in sect .",
    "[ period - spacing ] .",
    "we found the same best - fit model than before ( see table [ table2 ] , model 2 ) , but the quality of the fit is , as expected , substantially improved ( @xmath17 s ) .    in a further step , we relaxed the constraint of @xmath14 for all the observed periods of wd j1916@xmath03938 , and we redone our period fit by allowing the values @xmath14 or @xmath18 . we obtain exactly the same best - fit model as before . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we show the theoretical periods and the @xmath19- and @xmath20-identifications ( model 3 ) . for this period fit ,",
    "we obtain @xmath21 s. this is the best agreement with the observed periods we obtain , although in this case the @xmath20-identification is not the same as that assumed in sect .",
    "[ period - spacing ] to derive the period spacing value of the star .",
    "finally , we have carried out an additional period - fit , this time supposing that the periods at 823.9 s and 834.1 are the @xmath22 and @xmath23 components of a rotational triplet , in which the central component ( @xmath24 ) is missing ( see next section ) . under this assumption , we estimate the period of the @xmath25 component as the average of the @xmath22 and @xmath26 components .",
    "thus , we consider a period of 829 s in our period - fit procedure , instead the two periods at 823.9 s and 834.1 . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath14 for the set of @xmath16 periods at the outset . in this case , we obtain virtually the same asteroseismological model than before , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 k , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 s. the theoretical periods and @xmath31 values are shown in table [ table2 ] ( model 4 ) .",
    "we conclude that , even by adopting several different assumptions for the assignation of the @xmath20 and @xmath19 values to the observed periods , we found the same asteroseismological model which is characterised by an effective temperature of @xmath32 k , a surface gravity of @xmath33 , a stellar mass of @xmath34 , a mass of h of @xmath35 , and a he content of @xmath36 .",
    "the location of the best - fit model in the @xmath37 plane is depicted in fig .",
    "[ gteff ] .",
    "here , we suppose that the periods at 823.9 s and 834.1 are the @xmath22 and @xmath26 components , respectively , of a rotational triplet in which the central component ( @xmath24 ) is absent from the pulsation spectrum of wd j1916@xmath03938 . if this assumption is valid , we can infer a frequency spacing of @xmath38 @xmath39hz between the extreme components of the triplet . by assuming rigid and slow rotation , we have @xmath40 , being @xmath41 @xmath39hz and @xmath42 in the asymptotic limit for @xmath14 .",
    "then , we can infer a mean rotation period of @xmath43 hs for wd j1916@xmath03938 .",
    "this is in line with the values derived for other zz ceti stars from asteroseismology ( see , for instance , table 4 of fontaine & brassard 2008 ) .",
    "the fact that a da white dwarf like this , characterised by an effective temperature of @xmath44 k , and pulsating in high order @xmath1-modes with long periods , which usually have associated rotational kernels that are mostly confined to the outer layers of the star , prevent us to attempt a more profound analysis of the internal rotation of wd j1916@xmath03938 , like the one performed very recently by crsico et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for the gw vir star pg 0122 + 200 .",
    "tempted by the exciting discovery of the first pulsating da white dwarf in the _ kepler _ mission field by hea11 , and encouraged by the availability of the most complete set of detailed evolutionary and pulsation models for dav stars up to date ( romero et al .",
    "2011 ) , in this paper we have presented a first asteroseismological analysis of wd j1916@xmath03938 .",
    "this , even with the certainty that the full asteroseismological potential of this dav star will be exploited with further observations by _ kepler _ in the next years .    we summarize our main findings below :    * we derive a spectroscopic mass of @xmath45 for wd j1916@xmath03938 on the basis of the new da white dwarf evolutionary tracks of romero et al .",
    "this value is smaller than the estimate of hea11 , of @xmath46 , based on the older models of wood ( 1990 ) . in our analysis , we have taken into account the dependence of the tracks in the @xmath47 diagram with the thickness of the h envelope ( see fig .",
    "[ gteff ] ) . * by assuming that all the periods exhibited by wd j1916@xmath03938 are normal modes of the star , and supposing that all the periods except one ( at 834.1 s ) are associated to @xmath14 modes , we derive an average period spacing of @xmath48 s. on the basis of the asymptotic theory of stellar pulsations , we estimate a stellar mass of @xmath49 , corresponding to a thick h envelope .",
    "if we take into account the strong dependence of the asymptotic period spacing with the thickness of the h envelope , we found an evident degeneracy of @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in virtue of this",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath53 , but we can not say anything about the thickness of the h envelope . finally , if we ignore the constraint imposed by the effective temperature as derived by spectroscopy , we found that wd j1916@xmath03938 should have a stellar mass @xmath54 in order for the star to be within the zz ceti instability strip . * by using the individual pulsation periods exhibited by wd j1916@xmath03938 , and taking into account several assumptions for their @xmath20- and @xmath19-identification , we found an asteroseismological model with @xmath55 k , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . the stellar mass of the asteroseismological model is in good agreement with the spectroscopic estimate ( @xmath60 ) and with the derivation from the period spacing ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this is quite encouraging , because the three estimates have been derived from very different approaches and assumptions . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective temperature of the asteroseismological model is somewhat higher than the spectroscopic one ( @xmath62 k ) . * in passing ,",
    "we have estimated a rotation period of 18.77 hs for wd j1916@xmath03938 .",
    "the reliability of this result rests on the assumption that the modes with periods at 823.9 s and 834.1 are the @xmath63 and @xmath23 components , respectively , of a @xmath14 frequency triplet due to rotation .    in closing",
    ", we think that the conclusion that wd j1916@xmath03938 should be a rather massive zz ceti star , with @xmath64 , appears to be robust .",
    "the possibility that this rather massive pulsating white dwarf can be further monitored with _ kepler _ with a high degree of detail turns this star into a promising and unique target to study the physics of crystallization and carbon / oxygen phase diagrams at high densities . in this regard",
    ", we note that , for a stellar mass of @xmath65 , crystallization of matter should occur at the centre of a white dwarf star at @xmath66 k according to the phase diagram of segretain & chabrier ( 1993 ) , and at @xmath67 k if the new phase diagram recently proposed by horowitz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is considered ( althaus et al . 2011 ) .",
    "indeed , based on direct molecular dynamics simulations for dense carbon - oxygen mixtures , horowitz et al . ( 2010 ) find substantially lower crystallization temperatures and that the shape of the carbon - oxygen phase diagram is of the azeotropic form  and not of the spindle type  as previously believed .",
    "our analysis from the period spacing of wd j1916@xmath03938 suggests that this star could well have a stellar mass much higher than @xmath68 and necessarily a rather thin h envelope .",
    "if this were the case , this star could have a substantial fraction of its interior crystallized depending on the adopted carbon - oxygen phase diagram , an issue that could be explored with future asteroseismological analysis that exploit the new high - quality photometric data coming from the ongoing monitoring by the _",
