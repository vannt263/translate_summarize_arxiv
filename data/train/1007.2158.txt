    "<S> we discuss a new type of topological defect in xy systems where the o(2 ) symmetry is broken in the presence of a boundary . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the appearance of such defects in nanomagnets with a planar geometry . </S>",
    "<S> they are manifested as kinks of magnetization along the edge and can be viewed as halfvortices with winding numbers @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that halfvortices play a role equally important to that of ordinary vortices in the statics and dynamics of flat nanomagnets . </S>",
    "<S> domain walls found in experiments and numerical simulations are composite objects containing two or more of these elementary defects . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss a closely related system : the two - dimensional smectic liquid crystal films with planar boundary condition . </S>"
