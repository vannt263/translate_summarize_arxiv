    "by the end of the last century observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , used as standard candles , directly established the acceleration of the universe @xcite , an awesome result , possibly only surpassed by the discovery of its very own expansion , around eighty years ago .",
    "they are still the backbone for the prevailing @xmath1cdm concordance model , which is furthermore corroborated by the combination of other probes , such as , e.g. , cosmic microwave background anisotropies baryon acoustic oscillations and galaxy clustering @xcite .    the sample standard deviation in the inferred",
    ", uncorrected absolute @xmath5 magnitude of typical sets of sne ia is of the order 0.4 mag ( even after the exclusion of outliers such as the overluminous 1991t - like sne ia and the underluminous 1991bg - like sne ia ) @xcite .",
    "this amounts to a fractional uncertainty in luminosity of @xmath6 and ( under the assumption of negligible uncertainties in all other quantities ) in luminosity distance of @xmath7 .",
    "it is thus clear that sne ia are not exactly prima facie standard candles at all .",
    "however , even such a scatter , as compared to other categories of astrophysical sources ( other supernova types , gamma - ray bursts , etc ) , is small and , in conjunction with their typical high peak luminosity ( @xmath8 w@xmath9 ) , justifies the effort to improve their use as cosmological _",
    "standardizable _ candles .",
    "after some phenomenological standardization recipes ( cf . section [ sec : light_curve_fitting ] ) , the scatter in @xmath10 decreases to around 0.15 mag , which amounts to a fractional uncertainty in luminosity of @xmath11 and in luminosity distance of @xmath12 .    already in the landmark papers from the two original surveying groups @xcite",
    ", a legitimate concern was expressed about the presence of not properly accounted for systematic effects . at that time , however , there was only a small number ( the order of tens ) of observed sne ia in any of the available samples , so the uncertainties were statistically limited ; the main task was gathering new , larger , uniform datasets .",
    "for the recent compilations and surveys @xcite , and the more so for the future ones @xcite , we are no longer sample - limited ; the urgency is again on the physics of the sn ia phenomenon and all the aspects which impact it : nature of progenitor binary system ( single - degenerate versus double degenerate , tardy versus prompt events ) @xcite , properties of host galaxy @xcite , mechanisms of explosion @xcite , extinction / intrinsic color variations @xcite , k - correction and template calibration @xcite , flux calibration @xcite , inhomogeneities ( peculiar velocities @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite , etc ) .",
    "we would also like to call attention to the particularly clear , informative and up - to - date generic review articles on sne ia by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . simultaneously with this physical endeavor from first principles",
    ", we should also exercise our best statistical consistent practices to analyze and mine the data and to test the robustness of our inferences .",
    "it is to the latter that our paper is devoted .",
    "in contrast to the traditional @xmath0 approach present in most of the literature , in this work we discuss a different approach to parameter fitting based on the likelihood .",
    "we call attention to the fact that , when we want to estimate both the covariance and the mean of a gaussian process , the ordinary ( uncorrected ) @xmath0 approach ( or any iterative recipe therefrom , for that matter ) can not be straightforwardly applied , lest we might lose a nontrivial term in the objective function to be extremized .",
    "this is necessary when the covariance itself does depend on free parameters of the underlying model .",
    "recently , similar criticisms to the traditional @xmath0 method were presented by kim @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite a likelihood approach to simulated data for the distance moduli was used , and the focus was on the determination of the intrinsic dispersion , without reference to a particular light - curve fitter . in our work , by using real - data , the problem is reconsidered in the context of the mlcs2k2 and salt2 light - curve fitters . in particular , we point out that , in principle , with salt2 additional difficulties could arise due to the astrophysical parameters . we compare the results of the traditional @xmath0 treatment to the likelihood one .",
    "we restrict ourselves to sne ia datasets only , without taking into account other important sources of information ( such as cmb , baos or clusters ) in order to make our point pristine , by avoiding the masking due to any other such probes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : light_curve_fitting ] , we briefly remind the general procedure to go from the raw data to the final estimated parameters . in section [ sec : least_squares ] , we describe the two most widely used `` fitter pipelines '' ( mlcs2k2 and salt2 ) , which use the traditional @xmath0 approach . in section [ sec : likelihood ] , we critically review the aforementioned traditional approach and present the likelihood - based one . in section [ sec : results ] , the main numerical results are shown , for both fitters , in the case of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) first year compilation @xcite . finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we end up with some discussions and conclusions .",
    "the `` primary '' data of any sn ia survey are apparent magnitudes ( or fluxes ) in a given set of filters , at a series of epochs ( phases ) , for each supernova .",
    "this constitutes an array @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , where @xmath15 labels the supernova , @xmath16 labels the filter ( or band ) and @xmath17 labels the epoch in the time series . for a given supernova @xmath15 , observed in a given filter @xmath16 , the scatterplot of the points @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the observed time , is what we will call ( a sampling of ) the raw light curve .    as mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] , sne ia are _ standardizable _ candles ; this means there is a phenomenological recipe whereby the raw light curves , after being subjected to a transformation by a @xmath20-parameter function , furnish a new set of so - called _ standardized _ light curves ; this means the dispersion in the new magnitudes is considerably smaller than in the original input set .",
    "the aforementioned phenomenological recipe is not unique at all : there are several light - curve fitters in the literature @xcite . here",
    "we will exploit some features of the two most common ones : the multicolor light - curve shape ( mlcs2k2 ) @xcite one and the spectral adaptive light curve template ( salt2 ) @xcite .    in a nutshell :    * the mlcs2k2 fitting model @xcite describes the variation among sne ia light curves with a single parameter ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "excess color variations relative to the one - parameter model are assumed to be the result of extinction by dust in the host galaxy and in the milky way .",
    "the mlcs2k2 theoretical magnitude , observed in an arbitrary filter @xmath16 , at an epoch @xmath17 , is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is one of the supernova rest - frame filters for which the model is defined , @xmath21 is the mlcs2k2 shape - luminosity parameter that accounts for the correlation between peak luminosity and the shape / duration of the light curve .",
    "furthermore , the model for the host - galaxy extinction is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are constants ; as usual , @xmath28 is the @xmath29 band extinction , at @xmath5 band peak ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 , the ratio of @xmath29 band extinction to color excess , at @xmath5 band peak .",
    "finally , @xmath33 is the milky way extinction , @xmath34 is the @xmath35-correction between rest - frame and observer - frame filters , and @xmath36 is the distance modulus .",
    "the coefficients @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are model vectors that have been evaluated using nearly 100 well observed low - redshift sne ia as a training set .",
    "@xmath40 labels quantities at the @xmath5 band peak magnitude epoch .",
    "+ fitting the model to each sn ia magnitudes , usually fixing @xmath41 gives @xmath36 , @xmath21 , @xmath28 and @xmath42 , the @xmath5-band peak magnitude epoch .",
    "* the salt2 fitter @xcite makes use of a two - dimensional surface in time and wavelength that describes the temporal evolution of the de - redshifted ( rest - frame ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) or specific flux ( flux per unit wavelength ) for sne ia .",
    "the original model was trained on a set of combined light - curves and 303 spectra , not only from ( very ) nearby but also medium and high redshift sn ia .",
    "+ in salt2 , the de - redshifted ( rest - frame ) specific flux at wavelength @xmath43 and phase ( time ) @xmath44 ( @xmath45 at @xmath5-band maximum ) is modeled by @xmath46 \\exp [ cc(\\lambda ) ] .",

    "however , the salt2 light - curve fit does not yield an independent distance modulus estimate for each sn ia .",
    "as we will see in the next section , the distance moduli are estimated as part of a global parameter fit to an ensemble of sn ia light curves in which cosmological parameters and global sn ia properties are also obtained .    in the next section",
    "we will discuss how to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters using mlcs2k2 and salt2 output quantities as our data .",

    "as discussed in the previous section , each light curve fitter gives a different set of output or processed data , which are not related to the distance modulus in the same way . in this work , to construct the traditional @xmath0 function of this section or the proposed likelihood function of the next section , we consider as `` data '' the distance modulus estimation obtained from mlcs2k2 and salt2 processing .",

    "we also studied the possible evolution of the salt2 parameters @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath120 with the redshift , splitting the samples in redshift bins and performing the fit separately for each one .",
    "in this situation , we found evidence of evolution in the parameter @xmath92 and also in @xmath115 .    while this paper was in preparation two articles addressing the issue of using @xmath0 with unknown variances appeared in the arxiv .",
    "the first one @xcite focused on the question of the determination of @xmath121 , using simulated data for the distance modulus .",
    "the second one @xcite studied the salt2 case and proposed a sophisticated bayesian analysis .",
    "we did not find in our work with the sdss first year compilation any kind of catastrophic biases of parameters when adopting the likelihood approach , a possibility suggested in @xcite .    in summary , we used current data to compare the traditional @xmath0 and the likelihood approaches to determine best fit and confidence regions from sn ia .",
    "we argued that when the variance is not completely known , minimizing the traditional @xmath0 is not formally equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function , since the normalization of the likelihood , assumed gaussian , is also a function of parameters to be determined .",
    "we conclude suggesting the adoption of the likelihood framework instead of the traditional @xmath0 one , since it is more straightforward , numerically more efficient and self - consistent .",
    "we would like to thank masao sako for helpful discussions and suggestions .",
