    "any phenomenologically relevant theory of quantum gravity has to satisfy a number of physical requirements .",
    "in addition to internal or mathematical consistency , observations demand that such a theory has to provide for the existence of a semi - classical limit .",
    "another phenomenological requirement is the existence of light matter ( compared with the planck scale ) . in many studies of quantum gravity",
    ", matter is either ignored , or treated rather as a kinematic degree of freedom .",
    "for instance in string compactifications , information about the existence of light matter is drawn from anomaly - cancelation arguments .",
    "as soon as matter and interactions are taken into account dynamically , the existence of light matter is far from being self - evident : from a bottom - up viewpoint , the regime of quantum gravity is naturally defined as the domain where gravity fluctuations become as relevant as matter fluctuations .",
    "if gravity becomes even strongly interacting , its dynamical influence on the matter sector may even be similar to strong matter correlations as induced by the other forces of particle physics .",
    "this question becomes particularly paradigmatic in the case of fermions . in standard particle physics scenarios ,",
    "fermions are light because their mass is protected by chiral symmetry .",
    "so far , the mass of all fermionic matter content in the universe is associated with the phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this mass generation is a consequence of strong correlations among fermions . in the electroweak sector , these strong correlations are provided by the higgs sector , whereas gluon - induced interactions are responsible for mass generation in the strong interactions .",
    "gravity at first sight seems to have some similarity to these particle physics examples , as it is similar to yang - mills theories in many respects .",
    "therefore , the present work is devoted to a first investigation whether gravitational fluctuations can induce chiral symmetry breaking in a chiral fermion sector .",
    "if such a mechanism exists , any theory of quantum gravity would have to control it or evade it in a natural way .",
    "since such a mechanism would be active at or above the planck scale , it would naturally force fermions to have masses on the order of the planck scale in contrast to observation .    in our work",
    ", gravitational fluctuations are parameterized as fluctuations of the metric field .",
    "this is at least an effective description below or even near the planck scale . in the context of weinberg",
    "s asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity @xcite , this can even be a consistent description up to arbitrarily short distances .",
    "as asymptotic safety is built on the existence of a non - gauian fixed point in the gravitational couplings , i.e. , an interacting uv limit , the interplay between the gravitational sector and the chiral fermion sector is of particular interest .",
    "evidence for the existence of such a fixed point has been provided in different approaches @xcite .",
    "also causal dynamical triangulations ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) may be interpreted as providing evidence for this scenario .",
    "in particular the functional renormalization group ( rg ) , following the pioneering work of reuter @xcite has facilitated numerous studies supporting asymptotic safety in gravity @xcite , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "first steps in the investigation of the compatibility of asymptotically safe quantum gravity with quantized matter have been performed in @xcite . here",
    "the backreaction of fermionic and bosonic matter onto the gravitational fixed - point properties were investigated .",
    "the requirement of the existence of a physically admissible fixed point with a positive value for the newton coupling then imposes constraints on the matter content of the universe .",
    "most importantly , the matter content of the standard model of particle physics is compatible with asymptotically safe quantum gravity within the investigated truncation @xcite .",
    "( for work on the effect of the gravitational fixed point on gauge theories see @xcite .",
    "studies dealing with a possible solution of the triviality problem in the higgs sector through the coupling to gravity have been performed in @xcite . )    in this work , we explore the gravity - induced interactions and potentially strong correlations in a chiral fermion sector for the first time using the functional rg . as gravity shares some features with yang - mills theories ,",
    "we are motivated by recent advances in qcd , where chiral symmetry breaking can be understood as the consequence of a critical dynamics among the chiral fermions which is triggered by gluon - induced strong correlations @xcite ; for a successful determination of the critical temperature for chiral symmetry breaking in qcd using the functional rg , see @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that gravity might facilitate a similar mechanism in a strong - coupling regime .",
    "if so , such a mechanism might exhibit a dependence on control parameters of the theory such as the fermion flavor number @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , chiral quantum phase transitions as a function of @xmath0 have been observed in many systems such as many flavor qcd , qed@xmath1 or the 3-dimensional thirring model @xcite .",
    "our study of the gravitationally - stimulated chiral dynamics is based on a truncation of the full quantum effective action that concentrates on a fierz - complete basis of chiral fermionic four - point functions in the point - like limit .",
    "again , this is motivated by analogous studies in other theories , where such an ansatz provides both for an intuitive as well as quantitatively meaningful approach to chiral symmetry breaking .    as our main result",
    ", we do not find any indications for gravitationally - stimulated chiral symmetry breaking within this ansatz . whereas the gauian fermion matter fixed point turns into an interacting non - gauian one ,",
    "the universality properties of this fixed point receive rather small modifications in the asymptotic - safety scenario if fermionic degrees of freedom dominate the matter sector . as a general pattern , gravitational binding which would favor chiral symmetry breaking",
    "is compensated by gravitational contributions to anomalous scaling of the fermion interactions . within this minimal truncation",
    ", we can therefore conclude that asymptotic safety is well compatible with the existence ( and observation ) of light fermions despite an interacting uv sector which stimulates fermion self - interactions .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : we will introduce the functional rg as a tool for our investigation in sect .",
    "[ wetteq ] , and introduce the system that we study in sect .",
    "[ truncation ] .",

    "the functional rg facilitates the non - perturbative evaluation of full correlation functions . within the formulation used here ,",
    "we focus on the scale - dependent effective average action which is the generating functional of 1pi correlators that include all fluctuations from the ultraviolet ( uv ) down to the infrared ( ir ) scale @xmath2 . at @xmath3",
    ", @xmath4 coincides with the standard effective action @xmath5 .",
    "the scale dependence of the effective average action is governed by the wetterich equation @xcite @xmath6^{-1}(\\partial_t r_k)\\}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the second functional derivative of @xmath4 with respect to the fields , and @xmath9 is an ir regulator function . accordingly",
    "the right - hand side of the wetterich equation depends on the full ( field - dependent ) regularized propagator @xmath10 , which is matrix - valued in field space .",
    "the supertrace @xmath11 contains a trace over the spectrum of the full propagator in all appropriate indices ( i.e. on a flat background in the absence of classical background fields it translates into a momentum integral and a trace over lorentz and internal indices ) . for grassmann - valued fields the supertrace involves an additional negative sign . for reviews on the functional rg and the wetterich equation",
    "see @xcite .    since quantum fluctuations generate all possible operators compatible with the symmetries and the field content of the microscopic action , the effective ( average ) action lives in theory space which is spanned by all these operators .",
    "expanding @xmath12 into the infinite sum of all operators @xmath13 with running couplings @xmath14 allows to rewrite the wetterich equation as an infinite tower of coupled differential equations . in practice",
    ", a truncation of theory space to a smaller subspace is necessary . in the case of asymptotically safe quantum gravity ,",
    "numerous studies have shown a high degree of stability of truncations of the einstein - hilbert type and beyond .",
    "the results appear to converge under generalizations of the truncation in various ways , as well as under a change of the regularization scheme , thus providing strong support for the existence of the ngfp in full theory space @xcite .",
    "the perturbative non - unitarity of theories involving higher derivative operators does not directly apply here : indeed unitarity has to be reinvestigated within the non - perturbative setting and can remain intact within the asymptotic - safety scenario ( see e.g. corresponding discussions in @xcite ) .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the compatibility of the asymptotic - safety scenario with the existence of light fermionic matter .",
    "more generally , our results can be applied to generic effective theories of quantum gravity formulated in terms of fluctuations of the metric field and their interplay with chiral fermions .",
    "in the case of qcd - like theories , many studies based on functional methods suggest that chiral symmetry is broken for gauge couplings larger than a critical value @xcite . in direct analogy",
    "it is tempting to expect that there exists a critical value for the newton coupling at which metric fluctuations break chiral symmetry .",
    "this would agree with the picture that gravity is always attractive and thus should support fermionic binding phenomena .",
    "we investigate this scenario in a specific fermionic system with a chiral su@xmath15 @xmath16 su@xmath17 symmetry .",
    "we parameterize this system by an action of the form @xmath18,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 these fermionic self - interactions form a complete basis of four - fermion operators in the pointlike limit which are invariant under the chiral symmetry .",
    "the parentheses indicate expressions with fully contracted dirac indices .",
    "the @xmath20 matrices are understood to live in curved spacetime , being related to their flat - space cousins @xmath21 by the vielbein : @xmath22 .",
    "flavor indices are denoted by latin letters @xmath23 and run from 1 to @xmath24 .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath25 is given by @xmath26\\omega_{\\mu\\ , ab}\\psi$ ] , where @xmath27 denotes the spin connection .",
    "the latter can be determined in terms of the christoffel connection by demanding that @xmath28 .",
    "all other non - derivative su@xmath15 @xmath16 su@xmath29 symmetric four - fermion operators , e.g. a flavor non - singlet scalar - pseudo - scalar interaction , can be transformed into some combination of the above ones by a fierz transformation . including all of the basis operators implies that we cover all possible channels for chiral symmetry breaking in the point - like , i.e. momentum - independent , limit .",
    "this is important , as gravity might pick one specific channel to induce the breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "this ansatz of operators in the chiral sector is strongly motivated by similar lines of reasoning in qcd - like theories or other strongly - correlated fermionic systems . there , the ansatz is capable of describing the approach to chiral symmetry breaking qualitatively as well as quantitatively .",
    "of course , gravity may choose to break chiral symmetry in a fashion differing from yang - mills theory ; potential further mechanisms will be briefly outlined below .    in @xmath30",
    "dimensional spacetime , four - fermion interactions are perturbatively non - renormalizable . in an rg language",
    "this translates into the fact that these couplings are irrelevant at the gauian fixed point .",
    "accordingly they have to be set to zero at the uv scale in a fundamental theory in a perturbative setting . even if being zero initially , such couplings are generated by interactions in the flow towards the ir , for instance , in the context of qcd or also when coupled to gravity .",
    "the flow of such fermionic self - interactions can then provide indications for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "beyond perturbation theory , non - gauian fixed points may exist which could allow to construct a non - perturbatively renormalizable ( asymptotically safe ) theory with non - vanishing four - fermion interactions . in @xmath31 dimensions , for instance , the gross - neveu model provides for a simple and well - understood example of asymptotic safety @xcite .    at this point",
    ", we can already discuss the relation between chiral symmetry breaking and the fixed - point structure of the four - fermion couplings @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "for this , we introduce the dimensionless renormalized couplings @xmath33 and the fermionic anomalous dimension @xmath34 : @xmath35 due to the one - loop form of the wetterich equation , the @xmath36 functions for @xmath33 have the generic form @xmath37 herein the first term arises from dimensional ( and anomalous ) scaling .",
    "the quadratic contributions follow from a purely fermionic two - vertex diagram ( cf . diagram ( 2c ) in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] below ) . a tadpole contribution @xmath38 may also exist , as well as a @xmath39-independent part @xmath40 which results from the coupling to other fields , for instance , arising from the covariant derivative in the kinetic term in eq .  .",
    "the numerical values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 depend on the regulator , the contributions @xmath43 and @xmath44 will also depend on further couplings .",
    "specific representations will be given below .",
    "fixing all other couplings , the @xmath36 function of a given fermionic coupling @xmath45 as a function of @xmath33 is a parabola with two fixed points @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the coupled system of two fermionic @xmath36 functions then admits @xmath48 fixed points which need not necessarily all be real .    in order to illustrate the relevance of this fermionic fixed - point structure ,",
    "let us concentrate on the @xmath49 channel and perform a fierz transformation to the standard scalar - pseudo - scalar channel , @xmath50   = \\lambda_\\sigma\\big[(\\bar\\psi^i \\psi^j)^2-(\\bar\\psi^i\\gamma_5    \\psi^j)^2\\big ] , \\label{eq : fierz}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , and similarly for the pseudo - scalar channel .",
    "equation is an exact fierz identity if the couplings satisfy @xmath52 the fixed - point structure in the @xmath53 channel hence implies a corresponding fixed - point structure in the standard scalar - pseudo - scalar channel , where chiral symmetry breaking is expected to be visible . in fig .",
    "[ fig : parabolasketch ] , the @xmath36 function @xmath54 for this chiral channel is sketched for vanishing gravitational coupling .",

    "the parabola - type @xmath36 function exhibits two fixed points , the gauian fixed point at @xmath56 and a non - gauian fixed point at @xmath57 .",
    "arrows indicate the rg flow towards the ir .",
    "further interactions can shift the parabola ( dashed line ) and lead to an annihilation of the two fixed points ( dotdashed line ) .",
    "this annihilation is an indicator for an approach to chiral criticality .",
    "such a scenario typically occurs in qcd - like theories @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0%,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    if the system starts to the right of the non - gauian fixed point @xmath58 , the coupling runs towards very large values and actually diverges at a finite rg scale .",
    "whereas the point - like fermionic truncation breaks down here , a transition to a bosonized description with a boson being related to a fermion bilinear identifies the chiral coupling with the mass term of a chiral bosonic field @xmath59 .",
    "the divergence of the fermionic coupling therefore indicates that the bosonic mass term drops below zero which is a signature for symmetry breaking .",
    "it characterizes the onset of the effective chiral potential to acquire a mexican - hat form . in njl - type models , the non - gauian fixed point is identical to the critical value of the coupling @xmath60 required to put the system into the chiral symmetry broken phase .",
    "a new feature comes about by coupling the fermionic system to another interaction , e.g. a gauge theory .",
    "then , an originally weakly coupled fermion sector near the gauian fixed point can dynamically be driven to chiral criticality .",
    "for this , the gauian fixed point needs to annihilate with the non - gauian fixed point , such that the corresponding @xmath36 function for @xmath55 becomes completely negative , as indicated by the dashed and dotdashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : parabolasketch ] .",

    ", the last two terms together with the gravitational contribution to @xmath34 , in principle , have the potential to destabilize the fermionic fixed points and drive the fermionic system to criticality .",
    "whether or not this happens is a quantitative question that has to be addressed by integrating out gravitational fluctuations in a given quantum gravity theory .",
    "for the gravitational part we work in the background field formalism @xcite , where the full metric is split according to @xmath61 where this split does not imply that we consider only small fluctuations around e.g. a flat background . within the frg approach we have access to physics also in the fully non - perturbative regime .",
    "this formalism , being highly useful in non - abelian gauge theories ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , is mandatory in gravity , since the background metric allows for a meaningful notion of `` high - momentum '' and `` low - momentum '' modes as implied by the spectrum of the background covariant laplacian .",
    "the desired feature of background independence naively seems spoiled in this way ; however , the background formalism turns out to be merely a technical tool , leaving physical results unaffected and thus independent of the background @xcite .",

    "details on the second functional derivative of the effective action can be found in appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "the fermionic self - interactions @xmath70 do not directly contribute to the pure gravity flow .",
    "technically this is , because no one - loop diagram containing a fermionic four - point vertex can be formed that has only gravitons on external legs .",

    ", we will later treat @xmath34 as a free parameter to explore possible consequences of this difference between yang - mills theory and gravity .",
    "we decompose the metric fluctuations @xmath79 into a transverse traceless tensor , a transverse vector , a scalar , and the trace part .",
    "we then specialize to landau dewitt gauge , @xmath80 , which implies that only the transverse traceless tensor @xmath81 and the trace mode @xmath82 can contribute to the flow of the fermionic couplings ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "splitting @xmath83 , where all field - dependent terms enter the fluctuation matrix @xmath84 , we may now expand the right - hand side of the flow equation as follows : @xmath85^{-1}(\\partial_t r_k)\\}\\label{eq : flowexp}\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm str}\\ , \\tilde{\\partial}_t\\ln \\mathcal{p}_k + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n } { \\rm    str}\\ , \\tilde{\\partial}_t(\\mathcal{p}_k^{-1}\\mathcal{f}_k)^n , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the derivative @xmath86 in the second line by definition acts only on the @xmath2 dependence of the regulator , @xmath87 .",
    "since each factor of @xmath88 contains a coupling to external fields , this expansion simply corresponds to an expansion in the number of vertices . as we are interested in the flow of the four - fermion coupling , we can neglect terms with more than four vertices .",

    "quite generally , the fixed point structure in the fermionic flows for @xmath30 arises from a balancing between dimensional scaling @xmath170 and fermion fluctuations @xmath171 . whereas gauge - field fluctuations support the fermionic fluctuation channels , metric fluctuations also take a strong influence on the anomalous dimensional scaling which counteracts the general attractive effect of gravity .",
    "this viewpoint is further supported by other technical observations : whereas gravity is channel blind with respect to the scaling terms , i.e. , @xmath172 , gauge boson fluctuations with coupling @xmath173 also give rise to terms @xmath174 with @xmath175 that rather act like the above mentioned fluctuation terms .",
    "finally , we should mention that there are further examples that fluctuations of attractive forces do not necessarily support binding phenomena : e.g. , an effective flavored chiral yukawa interaction in qcd - like theories contributes via box diagrams with a sign opposite to that of gauge bosons to the fermionic flow @xcite .",
    "still , it should be kept in mind that the present analysis is carried out in a restricted truncation of the effective action that  though meaningful for qcd - like theories  might not be sufficient for gravity .",

    "we have investigated the quantum interplay between chiral fermions and metric fluctuations in quantum gravity .",
    "in contrast to qcd - like systems , where gluon fluctuations can induce strong fermionic correlations leading to chiral symmetry breaking , metric fluctuations do not support this mechanism in an analogous framework .",

    "light fermions are compatible with the asymptotic - safety scenario of quantum gravity which provides a uv completion of quantum gravity within quantum field theory . in particular , we observe a decoupling mechanism for metric fluctuations : as known from @xcite , the dominant effect of fermionic fluctuations is a shift of the gravitational non - gauian fixed point towards increasingly negative values of the dimensionless renormalized cosmological constant for larger numbers of flavors @xmath0 . as a consequence ,",

    "still , our results can be used to decompose the accessible theory space into those branches where the chiral sector remains symmetric and other branches where the chiral sector becomes critical and typically generates heavy fermion masses .",

    ", the universality properties of the shifted gauian matter fixed point can substantially vary .",
    "this analysis provides general constraints on the planck scale behavior of any microscopic theory of quantum gravity : the existence and observation of light fermions potentially excludes those branches of theory space where the chiral sector is critical at the planck scale .    of course , a variety of further aspects could modify our results quantitatively and qualitatively , as our analysis is performed in a limited and comparatively small hypersurface in theory space . still , the interplay between sizeable metric fluctuations and chiral symmetry has the potential to provide relevant phenomenological constraints for any theory of quantum gravity also in a more complete and quantitatively reliable investigation .",
    "let us try to list some issues that need to be addressed in further studies :    whereas we have used flat - space calculations mainly as a technical tool , the full theory of quantum gravity will predict an ( effective ) manifold as its solution to the equations of motion .",
    "this resulting background may take influence on the chiral status of the matter sector itself , as it may screen or enhance fermionic long - range fluctuations that lead to chiral criticality .",
    "screening mechanisms for chiral symmetry breaking of this type have already been studied in various chiral models , such as two- and three - dimensional ( gauged ) thirring models @xcite or the four - dimensional gauged njl model @xcite .",
    "depending on its sign , curvature can act like an ir cutoff that screens the critical ir fluctuations .",
    "also , if the question of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration is considered in a cosmological context , the thermal evolution of the universe may play an essential role .",
    "broken chiral symmetry could be restored during reheating , if the corresponding temperature is sufficiently high compared with the scale of critical fermion dynamics  independently of whether it is stimulated by metric fluctuations or another mechanism .",
    "let us also discuss the possibility of gravity - stimulated chiral symmetry breaking which would strongly differ from the scenario arising from qcd - like theories . as gravity supports a richer structure of operators , chiral criticality could be triggered by operators that are typical for gravity , but do not occur for other theories .    up to canonical dimension four and five , only explicitly symmetry breaking terms ( as e.g. @xmath176 ) exist .    at dimension six ( for two - fermion terms ) and eight ( for four - fermion - terms )",
    "we encounter a variety of new terms that are not forbidden by explicit chiral symmetry breaking , for instance @xmath177 at higher dimensionalities the number of terms increases considerably , as then also e.g. contractions involving the riemann tensor will be possible .",
    "furthermore couplings involving @xmath178 or higher powers of the curvature are possible .",
    "distinguishing between the background and the fluctuation metric leads to an even larger `` zoo '' of possible operators .",
    "several comments are in order here : the effect of metric fluctuations implies that none of these couplings will have a gauian fixed point , as the antifermion - fermion - two - graviton vertex generically generates these couplings even if they are set to zero .",

    "<S> our results based on the functional renormalization group indicate that chiral symmetry is left intact even at strong gravitational coupling . in particular , we find that asymptotically safe quantum gravity where the gravitational couplings approach a non - gauian fixed point generically admits universes with light fermions . </S>",

    "<S> a study of chiral symmetry breaking through gravitational quantum effects may serve as a significant benchmark test also for other quantum gravity scenarios , since a completely broken chiral symmetry at the planck scale would not be in accordance with the observation of light fermions in our universe . </S>",
