    "as the most luminous persistent sources in the universe , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which are powered by the mass accretion of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , are widely believed to play important roles in the formation and evolution of typical massive galaxies ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , over the past sixteen years",
    ", many studies have revealed that there are tight correlations between smbhs and the physical properties of host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the smbh mass , @xmath12 , correlates well with the stellar mass of the bulge , @xmath13 .",
    "the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath14 relation is found to be @xmath15 .",
    "such a tight correlation might be explained by agn feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario , winds or jets launched from the accretion disk of the smbh heat the interstellar medium ( ism ) or clear the ism out of the host galaxy .",
    "star formation is therefore quenched due to the lack of cold gas .",
    "such a coupled agn triggering and feedback - regulated star formation could be responsible for the @xmath14 relation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , a non - causal origin of the @xmath14 relation has also been proposed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are not initially correlated .",
    "the @xmath14 relation is established simply by galaxy - galaxy mergers via the central limit theorem .",
    "direct observational measurement of the evolution of the @xmath14 relation is crucial to investigate the formation and co - growth of smbhs and their hosts .",
    "observationally , the evolution of the @xmath14 relation is still a controversial topic .",
    "moreover , at high redshift ( e.g. , @xmath16 ) , it is very difficult to separate the bulge from the total stellar mass .",
    "instead , most works explore the @xmath17 relation , where @xmath18 is the galaxy total stellar mass . for instance , @xcite find that at @xmath19 the @xmath17 relation is consistent with the local @xmath14 relation .",
    "note that the host galaxies of the local sample of @xcite ( hereafter hr04 ) are bulge dominated ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) .",
    "therefore , the @xcite result suggests little evolution of the @xmath17 relation to @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , the hosts of the @xcite sample have substantial disks ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) .",
    "that is , the @xmath14 relation does evolve as a function of redshift . making the local @xmath14 relation then , as pointed out by @xcite , requires a redistribution of stellar mass from disks into bulges in agn host - galaxies .",
    "recently , the work of @xcite with a larger and less - biased sample also supported the results of @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite compiled a broad emission - line agn ( blagn ) sample with well - measured multi - band photometry from the cosmos survey . with this sample ,",
    "they find that even the @xmath17 relation evolves ( at @xmath22 significance level ) over cosmic time ( i.e. , the smbh is over - massive at high redshifts ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , high - redshift samples are generally selected by agn activity ( which depends on @xmath12 ) and suffer from eddington bias .",
    "the physical reasons are : ( 1 )  there is intrinsic scatter in the @xmath14 or @xmath17 relation ; ( 2 )  the galaxy stellar mass function is bottom heavy ( i.e. , the number density of galaxies steeply decreases to higher stellar mass ) .",
    "hence , for these high - redshift samples , an agn with given @xmath12 is more likely to be found in less massive galaxies , resulting in an apparent evolution of the @xmath5 or @xmath17 relation ( also see section  [ sec : bias ] ) .",
    "this bias increases with redshift as at high redshifts we often only have access to very luminous agns ( very massive smbhs ) .",
    "additionally , @xmath12 estimation itself is also biased for these high - redshift samples @xcite .",
    "the reasons are similar : ( 1 )  @xmath12 is estimated from agn luminosity which also has intrinsic scatter ; ( 2 )   the agn luminosity function is also bottom heavy .",
    "note that the sample of @xcite consists of mostly lower luminosity agns and hence suffers less bias than @xcite .",
    "bias corrections must be made to compare the high - redshift @xmath17 relation with the local one ( for a more recent discussion on this topic , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to measuring the @xmath17 relation at high redshift , it is also valuable to study its instantaneous evolution ; i.e. , the smbh and galaxy stellar mass growth rates . especially , will future smbh and galaxy mass increases help establish / maintain the @xmath17 relation ?",
    "this question has been indirectly investigated .",
    "for example , many works explored the possible connection between star formation rates ( sfrs ) and agn luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and also see alexander & hickox 2012 for a review ) .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , agn variability can dilute the intrinsic correlation between star formation and agn activity .",
    "therefore , this connection is expected to be observed only in an average sense , as individual galaxies will tend to show a much weaker ( or absent ) correlation .",
    "the average smbh accretion rate traces the average sfr so well that the local @xmath17 relation can be established .    simultaneously exploring both",
    "the @xmath17 relation at high redshifts and its instantaneous evolution is even more valuable but is challenging .",
    "@xcite explore this issue by measuring @xmath12 , @xmath18 , and their growth rates .",
    "they find that star formation and agn activity can actually help reduce the scatter of the @xmath17 relation .",
    "however , the sfr in their work is estimated by fitting a stellar population synthesis model to the optical - to - nir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which has an uncertainty of @xmath23 . a more accurate determination of sfr ( e.g. , with _ herschel _ observations ) could better elucidate the coupled growth of agns and their host galaxies .",
    "in this work , we uniquely explore the @xmath0 relation and its evolution , accounting for biases and using robust and uncontaminated estimates of smbh growth and galaxy star formation rate . in section  [ sec : data ] , we describe our sample in detail . in section  [ sec : property ] , we describe our methods for estimating @xmath12 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . in section",

    "the @xmath30-@xmath31 cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos , * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath32-@xmath33 chandra deep field - south survey ( cdf - s ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) both have well - calibrated multi - band photometry ( from the x - ray to radio bands ) and high - quality spectroscopic coverage .",
    "hence , we selected our sample from the cosmos and cdf - s fields .",

    "for x - ray observations , we prefer _ chandra _ over _ xmm - newton _ and hard band over soft band ( i.e. , the _ chandra _ hard band has the highest priority , and the _ xmm - newton _ soft band has the lowest priority ) . as pointed out by @xcite and will be shown in figure  [ fig : bolz ] , our agn selection is limited by the @xmath36 criteria and not the x - ray sensitivity ( whether _ xmm - newton _ or _ chandra _ ) .    to get a robust estimate of sfr ,",
    "we cross - matched our blagn sample with the _ herschel _ pep ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and hermes ( @xmath40 ) catalogs .",
    "note that for the hermes catalog the spire/_herschel _ observations have a large point - spread function .",
    "we followed @xcite and chose a maximum matching radius of @xmath41 .",

    "therefore , we can estimate the smbh mass from @xmath65 , and @xmath68 , @xmath70 where @xmath65 and @xmath68 are in units of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "this relation has an intrinsic scatter of @xmath73 dex @xcite , which is due to the unknown blr geometry and other factors ( e.g. , ionization state ) .",

    "five of these nine sources show strong absorption features superposed on the broad emission lines .",
    "the removal of these sources should not introduce a selection bias to our sample , since they are essentially random occurrences which are unlikely to be strongly correlated with eddington ratio or host properties .",

    "a summary of smbh masses can be found in table  2 ( before compiling the table , we removed another 18 sources because of inadequate fir data , see section  [ sec : sfr ] ) .",

    "we utilized an sed fitting technique to estimate @xmath18 .",
    "since we were dealing with blagns , the seds ( from uv to near ir ) of the host galaxies are contaminated by agn emission .",
    "we therefore followed the approach of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) which fits the observed seds as a composite of both agn and galaxy stellar emission .",
    "that is , @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the fluxes from the agns and host galaxies , respectively . for seds ,",
    "fourteen bands ( observed - frame wavelength ranging from @xmath89 to @xmath90 ) are used for the cosmos sources and 32 bands ( observed - frame wavelength ranging from @xmath91 to @xmath90 ) are used for the cdf - s sources . for agn emission , we adopted the mean sed template of @xcite . for galaxy templates , we selected from an sed library constructed using the @xcite stellar population synthesis model .",
    "we assumed an initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite and adopted ten exponentially declining star formation histories ( sfhs ) , i.e. , sfr @xmath92 , with star formation timescale @xmath93 ranges from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , plus a sfh with constant sfr .",
    "the galaxy age ranges from @xmath96 to @xmath97 with an additional constraint that the galaxy age should not be larger than the age of the universe at the redshift of the source .",
    "the sed library was generated iterating over @xmath93 and the galaxy age .",
    "when fitting the observed sed , we also took intrinsic extinction into consideration . for agns , we used a small magellanic cloud - like dust - reddening curve @xcite with @xmath98 .",
    "for galaxies , we adopted the calzetti extinction curve @xcite with @xmath99 if @xmath100 , otherwise @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "we additionally required that the agn continuum emission should be larger than @xmath102 of the galaxy continuum emission at @xmath103 ( if the  virial mass estimator was used ) or @xmath104 ( if the h@xmath63 virial mass estimator was used ) .",
    "this was simply motivated by the fact that our sources all have observed broad emission lines ( h@xmath63 or ) indicative of a significant agn contribution .",
    "we chose @xmath102 based on the following considerations : ( 1 )  we performed a simple simulation by creating a mock spectrum with a young galaxy sed , an agn ( power - law ) component , a broad gaussian emission line with a typical equivalent width of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) for  ( h@xmath63 ) ( e.g. , section 1.3.4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and white noise ( assuming a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath107 ) ; ( 2 )  we refitted the mock spectrum with a power - law and a gaussian emission line and found that we can not reliably fit the emission line if the agn emission is less than @xmath6 of galaxy emission .",

    ", we determined both the normalization , @xmath109 , @xmath93 , and the sfh of our galaxy sed .",

    "this small correction ( accounting for the contamination of the stellar light of the host galaxy ) has been included when calculating @xmath65 from the continuum component in section  [ sec : mbh ] .",
    "to measure the accretion rate , @xmath24 , we estimated the bolometric luminosity , @xmath112 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "first , we used the rest - frame @xmath37 luminosity to get the @xmath132 luminosity ( assuming @xmath116 and a cut - off at @xmath133 ) ; second , we integrated the big blue bump component ( from @xmath105 to @xmath134 ) in the best - fitted agn sed which should be responsible for the emission from the accretion disk ( note that we neglected the ir `` torus '' emission as it is probably reprocessed ) ; finally , we obtained the bolometric luminosity by summing the @xmath132 luminosity and the total big blue bump luminosity .",
    "this approach gives a direct estimate of @xmath112 .",

    "that is , our results indicate that the apparent @xmath255 seems to increase from high to low redshift .",
    "this turns out to be largely due to selection effects ; after modeling the biases in section  [ sec : dis ] , we find that the data are consistent with a uniform agn duty cycle at both high and low redshift .",
    "in addition , for both sub - samples , the specific black hole mass growth rate distributions show negligible tails at the growth rate @xmath256 ( see figure  [ fig : gwr ] ) , where @xmath257 .",
    "these negligible tails agree with the conclusion of , e.g. , @xcite that blagns have a minimum eddington ratio of @xmath258 .",
    "we use these specific growth rates to investigate the `` flow patterns '' ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of our sample in the @xmath0 plane",
    ". figures  [ fig : fpa ] and [ fig : fps ] plot the results .",
    "the direction of the vector is defined by @xmath255 while the color map indicates the absolute specific growth rate ( i.e. , a summation of the specific smbh mass growth rate and the specific galaxy total stellar mass growth rate in quadrature ) along the vector ( which spans more than two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "we again include the local hr04 relation and its @xmath7 uncertainty as the dashed line and the shaded region . for simplicity , these figures do not show the uncertainties of @xmath255 on the plot ( the uncertainties can instead be seen in figure  [ fig : grms ] ) .",
    "in general , agns and galaxies which are outliers in @xmath230 tend to have evolutionary vectors whose directions are anti - correlated with their positions : galaxies with over - massive smbhs tend to have lower @xmath255 , and galaxies with under - massive smbhs tend to have higher @xmath255 .",
    "this anti - correlation behavior can be seen not only for the whole sample ( figure  [ fig : fpa ] ) but also for each sub - sample ( the left and right panels of figure  [ fig : fps ] ) . as will be shown in section  [ sec : dis2 ] , this result is not solely due to selection effects . in sections  [ sec :",
    "dis2 ] and [ sec : dis3 ] , we demonstrate the anti - correlation between the ( instantaneous ) growth rate and mass ratios , if extended over some time with an agn duty cycle of @xmath94 , implies that agn activity and star formation could maintain the @xmath17 relation .",
    "in section  [ sec : msevol ] we showed that our sample exhibits no apparent redshift evolution in the @xmath0 relation .",
    "therefore , our results along with , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite suggest that the @xmath0 relation does not evolve strongly with redshift . as stated before ,",
    "the local inactive galaxies of hr04 are bulge - dominated ( @xmath259 )",
    ". meanwhile , our sources ( at least a significant fraction ) are likely to have substantial disk components .",
    "first , our sources show strong star formation activity which indicates non - negligible disk components ( for example , lang et al .",
    "2014 suggest that star - forming galaxies are likely to have smaller bulge - to - total ratios ) .",
    "in addition , for the x - ray luminosity and redshift ranges of our sources , a substantial fraction of agns reside in disk galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath260 ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , we have also cross - matched our sample with that of @xcite ( for cosmos sources ) and @xcite ( for cdf - s sources ) and found that five out of the fourteen matched sources have srsic index much smaller than @xmath261 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath5 relation is likely to evolve ( at least mildly ) with redshift . as suggested by @xcite , a redistribution of stellar mass from disk to bulge",
    "is required to build the local @xmath5 relation .",
    "our results suggest that in the next @xmath262 a typical galaxy in our sample would ( 1 )  increase its galaxy total stellar and smbh masses accordingly ; ( 2 )  transfer much of its stellar mass from its disk to its bulge .",
    "the former indicates that gas fueling controls both agn activity and star formation ( see section  [ sec : dis2 ] for more details ) . for the redistribution of stellar mass from disk to bulge ,",
    "possible mechanisms are , e.g. , violent disk instabilities ( which are driven by cold gas , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or galaxy mergers @xcite . the former mechanism is proposed since our sources are likely to have substantial cold gas @xcite , although observational evidence of violent disk instabilities in agn hosts is mixed @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism is also attractive as it can not only redistribute stellar mass from disk into bulge but also help reduce the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath0 relation @xcite .",
    "note that our agns are more likely fueled by cold gas rather than triggered by galaxy - galaxy mergers ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and our next section ) .",
    "therefore , if galaxy - galaxy mergers do play a role , they are likely to be dry mergers rather than gas - rich wet mergers .",
    "currently , our estimation ( see section  [ sec : msevol ] ) indicates that the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath0 relation is not significantly larger than that of the hr04 relation .",
    "however , this estimation is also subject to selection biases . using our simulated samples in section  [ sec : bias ]",
    ", we found that a range of intrinsic scatter ( e.g. , @xmath263 dex ) can reproduce the observed scatter . on the other hand , our selection corrections in section  [ sec : msevol ]",
    "are made by assuming the @xmath0 relation has the same intrinsic scatter as the hr04 relation and our data are consistent with the bias - corrected hr04 relation .",
    "this indicates that the intrinsic scatter of our sample should not be significantly larger than that of the hr04 relation ( i.e. , the intrinsic scatter is at most @xmath264 dex ) .",
    "an average of one major merger for each of our galaxies is enough to reduce the intrinsic scatter by a factor of @xmath265 @xcite if the intrinsic scatter is indeed @xmath264 dex rather than @xmath160 dex .      in section  [ sec : tmevol ]",
    ", we demonstrated that agns which are offset from the @xmath0 relation tend to have ( instantaneous ) evolutionary vectors which are anti - correlated with their mass offsets .",
    "that is , galaxies with over - massive ( under - massive ) smbhs tend to have lower ( higher ) @xmath255 .",
    "we quantify the anti - correlation between @xmath230 and @xmath255 by performing a linear fit ( via chi - squared minimization , taking the uncertainties into consideration ) .",
    "results are plotted in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : grms ] .",
    "the red vertical dashed lines represent the local @xmath230 .",
    "the red horizontal dashed lines correspond to @xmath266 .",
    "there are more sources above the horizontal lines .",
    "if the growth rate rates persist over some length of time , then this asymmetric distribution indicates the agn duty cycle is less than unity ( i.e. , the lifetime of an active smbh is smaller than the lifetime of star formation ) ; otherwise the smbh will become over - massive as we evolve our sources .",
    "for example , if we assume our sources keep their current @xmath24 and sfr for some timescales @xmath267 and @xmath268 , we expect blagn hosts to evolve as @xmath269 . to maintain the @xmath0 relation , we expect that , on average , @xmath270 . in section  [ sec : dis3 ] , we derive the appropriate agn duty cycle ( @xmath271 ) such that , under appropriate assumptions about the agn activity and star formation histories , the @xmath0 relation is maintained .",
    "the red solid lines are for the best fits of the anti - correlation : for the high - redshift sub - sample , the best fit is @xmath272 ; for the low - redshift sub - sample , the best fit is @xmath273 . in each sub - sample , the slopes are consistent with @xmath274 and differ from zero at a high significance level ( for the high - redshift sub - sample , the null probability is @xmath275 ; for the low - redshift one , @xmath276 ) .",
    "the anti - correlation between the _ specific _ growth rate ratio ( s@xmath24/ssfr ) and the mass ratio , with slope of @xmath274 , implies that the _ absolute _ growth rate ratio ( @xmath24/sfr ) is not correlated with the mass ratio and is a constant ( with small scatter ) .",
    "we demonstrate this in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : grms ] .",
    "a linear fit ( via chi - squared minimization ) between @xmath277 and @xmath230 results in a slope of @xmath278 , i.e. , statistically consistent with zero .",
    "the relatively narrow distribution of the @xmath24/sfr ratio is in agreement with @xcite , after accounting for the agn duty cycle ( see section  [ sec : dis3 ] ) .    to test whether this anti - correlation and the narrow distribution of @xmath24/sfr ratio are simply due to selection effects we again turn to the monte carlo simulations in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "these simulations created mock samples with @xmath83 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and sfr following the same selection criteria as our data .",
    "we tested three eddington - ratio distributions which are log - normal with scatter ( @xmath183 ) of @xmath216 , @xmath84 and @xmath136 , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , we use the same @xmath152 and @xmath17 relations and scatter as in section 4 , and @xmath186 is set such that the uncertainty of the virial @xmath12 is @xmath279 dex .",
    "we created 69 mock samples , one at each redshift of the 69 observed blagns , with @xmath280 sources in each mock sample .    the initial mock sample ( i.e.",
    ", the one without any selection cut - offs ) at each redshift does not show an anti - correlation between the ratio of the masses and their growth rates .",
    "indeed , spearman s correlation test indicates a coefficient of @xmath281 for @xmath200 or weaker depending on @xmath183 ) .",
    "we then applied the same ( redshift - dependent ) cut - offs presented in section  [ sec : bias ] to these mock samples .",
    "finally , we randomly selected @xmath282 sources from the 69 mock samples ( i.e. , selected one source per mock sample ) and calculated the corresponding @xmath283 ( for our blagns sample , @xmath284 ) and the scatter of the distribution of @xmath277 ( for our blagns sample , the scatter is @xmath136 ) .",
    "note that , in this step , we added @xmath159 dex uncertainty to @xmath24 and @xmath168 dex uncertainty to sfr to mimic approximately the measurement error in each variable ( see section  [ sec : err ] ) .",
    "we repeated the selection @xmath202 times and constructed the distribution of @xmath283 .",
    "we found that , of all the eddington - ratio distributions tested , the @xmath285 model comes closest to reproducing the observed anti - correlation between @xmath255 and @xmath17 , albeit with a probability of only @xmath286 .",
    "the simulations also indicate that the probability to reproduce the observed scatter of the distribution of @xmath277 is only @xmath287 .",
    "note that in the @xmath200 model , the scatter between agn luminosity and sfr is only @xmath288 dex . broader eddington - ratio distributions ( e.g. , uniform or shallow power - law ) decrease the likelihood of selection effects reproducing a constant @xmath24/sfr ratio , as do larger values of @xmath289 or @xmath290 .",
    "moreover , we also performed the same simulations to the high- and low - redshift sub - samples and found the likelihood of selection effects also decrease .    from the simulations",
    ", we can conclude that the observed anti - correlation between specific growth ratio and mass ratio and/or the narrow distribution of @xmath291 are unlikely to be solely due to selection effects but instead support the idea that there is a ( instantaneous ) connection between star formation and smbh accretion activity ( see the lower panels of figure  [ fig : grms ] ) .",
    "however , this conclusion rests upon the ( rather uncertain ) assumed eddington - ratio distribution , as well as the similarly uncertain intrinsic scatter in @xmath12 and @xmath17 .",
    "better estimates of these quantities and their scatter are necessary to fully confirm that our results are not purely a selection effect .",
    "agn feedback may explain the anti - correlation between @xmath255 and @xmath292 and the constant ratio of @xmath24/sfr .",
    "as has been long suggested , agn feedback may regulate star formation and therefore maintain a correlation between agn accretion and galaxy star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , recent simulations with a more realistic ism structure suggest that agn feedback can inject substantial energy into the ism without having significant effect on cold gas in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if so , our results are difficult to explain by agn feedback .",
    "our results can also be understood in a scenario where agn activity and star formation are both governed by cold gas supply , without a need for agn feedback .",
    "this scenario could lead to a connection between the agn luminosity and sfr or even an agn `` main sequence '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a host galaxy with an under - massive smbh , we would expect the specific smbh mass growth rate to be larger than that of the host galaxy since the mean ratio of the sfr to agn luminosity remains roughly constant with changing @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "that is , an under - massive smbh has a preferentially steeper evolutionary vector than an over - massive smbh on the @xmath0 plane .",
    "we are also interested in the agn duty cycle and star formation timescale , @xmath293 , that would maintain the @xmath0 relation as our sources evolve forward in time .",
    "we started with a monte carlo simulation which re - sampled @xmath12 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath294 based on the observed values and errors for every source in our sample .",
    "for each realization , we evolved every source in time and calculated their new positions in the @xmath0 plane by integrating @xmath295 and @xmath296 over a grid of agn duty cycles and @xmath293 .",
    "for the high- ( low- ) redshift sub - sample , all sources were evolved from their current redshifts to @xmath205 ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "@xmath295 was assumed to be @xmath298 , where @xmath299 was the re - sampled @xmath300 . as for @xmath296",
    ", we assumed that , on average ( e.g. , over @xmath301 ) , @xmath302 .",
    "that is , following similar derivations in the previous section , the new positions of our sources are ( @xmath303 , @xmath304 ) , where @xmath305 and @xmath306 ( as long as the evolution timescale is much larger than @xmath293 ) . @xmath307 and @xmath308 are the observed smbh mass and galaxy stellar mass , respectively .",
    "we define the agn duty cycle as @xmath309 . assuming our agn hosts are drawn from the star - forming main sequence as suggested by @xcite this definition of agn duty cycle essentially measures the fraction of blagns among star - forming galaxies ( we will discuss this definition later ) .",
    "we then determined the fraction ( @xmath310 ) of our sources whose new positions are consistent with the biased hr04 mass ratio ( see section  [ sec : bias ] ) and its @xmath7 uncertainty for each combination of agn duty cycle and @xmath293 .",
    "finally , we found the agn duty cycle and @xmath293 that result in the highest @xmath310 .",
    "after @xmath311 re - sampled realizations , we obtained the distribution of the agn duty cycle and @xmath293 that would best maintain the @xmath0 relation .",
    "the duty cycle used here is only equivalent to @xmath312 or @xmath313 if @xmath314 and @xmath315 are both very small ( i.e. , if @xmath316 and @xmath317 both are @xmath318 , then , @xmath319 ) .",
    "this is true for our low - redshift sample .",
    "if , however , @xmath316 and/or @xmath317 are @xmath320 ( e.g. , our high - redshift sample ) , the agn duty cycle is a complicated function of @xmath12 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and sfr . actually , for our assumed smbh accretion and star formation histories , our definition of the duty cycle measures the ratio of the lifetime of blagns to that of active star formation .",
    "the two - dimensional pdf of the agn duty cycle and @xmath293 is plotted in figure  [ fig : duty ] for the high - redshift ( left panel ) and low - redshift ( right panel ) sub - samples .",
    "the blue contour in each panel represents the``@xmath7 '' scatter of the most likely agn duty cycle and @xmath293 .",
    "that is , given the measurement errors of @xmath12 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath294 , there is a @xmath321 probability that agn duty cycles and @xmath293 which best maintain the @xmath0 relation are within the contour . to estimate the one - dimensional distribution of the agn duty cycle (",
    "regardless of @xmath293 ) , we integrated the two - dimensional pdf along @xmath293 . from this distribution ,",

    "the large confidence intervals for the agn duty cycle are partly due to the large uncertainties in the estimated masses and growth rates .",
    "there may also be a large intrinsic scatter in agn duty cycle between different galaxies .",
    "we note that these duty cycles are appropriate only for rapidly accreting smbhs ( i.e. , blagns or other agns with similar eddington ratios ) in star - forming galaxies .",

    "in this paper , we studied 69 blagns selected from the cosmos and cdf - s fields based on x - ray observations , fir observations , high - quality spectroscopy , and multi - band photometry . with these data , we simultaneously determined @xmath12 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and sfr and investigated the evolution of the @xmath0 relation .",

    "our results can be advanced in several regards .",
    "first , our sample size is significantly limited by the _ herschel _ sensitivity .",
    "only @xmath332 of blagns are detected by _",

    "future deeper rest - frame fir observations ( e.g. , with alma , scuba-2 , spica ) can enlarge the sample size and are crucial for reducing the uncertainty and improving our understanding of the connection between agn activity and star formation . as we have pointed out in section  [ sec : bias ] , the biases we mentioned ( e.g. , the bias of @xmath83 alone and the bias of @xmath230 ) depend on this connection .",
    "therefore , deeper fir surveys can also help us better address the selection biases in this work .",
    "this improvement , in turn , providing benefits to both our understanding of the co - evolution of smbhs and their host galaxies ( e.g. , the formation of the local @xmath5 relation ) and smbh mass demographics .    also , the large intrinsic scatter of @xmath83 prevents us from obtaining higher confidence level conclusions .",
    "future improvements of the single - epoch virial estimators will be very helpful ( for example , with large multi - object reverberation mapping campaigns * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , more detailed observations and studies of physical properties ( other than @xmath18 ) of the host galaxies are also very important .",
    "these properties ( e.g. , morphology and gas content ) can help place additional distinct constraints on the co - evolution path of smbhs and their host galaxies ( e.g , the bulge - to - total ratio and the agn / star formation triggering mechanism ) .",
