    "a _ switched system _ @xcite comprises of two components  a finite family of systems and a _ swicthing signal _ that selects an active subsystem from the family at every instant of time .",
    "switched systems arise in a multitude of application areas such as networked systems , quantization , variable structure systems , etc ; see e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .    stability of switched systems has attracted considerable research attention over the past few decades , see @xcite for detailed surveys . in this article",

    "* chapter 3 ) as a continuation of our study of switched systems initiated in @xcite . to wit",
    ", we are concerned with identifying classes of switching signals for which the switched system under consideration is globally asymptotically stable , as well as algorithmic synthesis of stabilizing switching signals .",
    "conditions for stability under constrained switching typically employ the idea of _ slow switching _",
    "vis - a - vis _ ( average ) dwell time _ switching .",
    "although these results were originally developed in the setting of continuous - time systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) , @xcite , they can be readily extended to the discrete - time setting , with the ( average ) dwell time expressed in terms of the number of time steps @xcite .",
    "most of these results apply to switched systems with all stable subsystems .    in the presence of unstable dynamics in the family ,",
    "slow switching alone is not sufficient to guarantee stability of the switched system .",
    "additional conditions are required to ensure that the switched system does not spend too much time on the unstable subsystems ; see e.g. , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors discuss a class of switching signals for global exponential stability of a switched system in which not all subsystems are schur stable ( or even when no subsystem is schur stable ) but the unstable subsystems form a stable combination .",
    "the characterization of the stabilizing switching signal involves a modified definition of average dwell time and the method of activating the schur stable subsystems ( if any ) arbitrarily but activating the unstable subsystems depending on a pre - specified ratio .",
    "however , none of the above works ventured beyond switching signals with switching _ frequencies _ that are faster than a constant .    keeping to the general tune of slow switching while extending its scope considerably ,",
    "in this article we consider switched systems with unstable dynamics and design a class of stabilizing switching signals that transcends beyond the ( average ) dwell time regime .",
    "moreover , given a switched system , we derive a sufficient condition for the existence of the proposed switching signal .",
    "this matter demands attention in the context of switched systems because given a switched system , a purely time - dependent stabilizing switching signal may be difficult to find .",
    "we also present an algorithmic approach to construct a switching signal that satisfies the proposed condition . more specifically ,",
    "our contributions are :    * we propose a family of stabilizing switching signals such that : * * the switching signals are more general than those having a certain average dwell time .",
    "in particular , switching rates that are faster than a constant are admissible . *",
    "* we specify _ only _ certain asymptotic properties of the switching signal ; there is , therefore plenty of flexibility insofar as the transient behaviour of the switching signals are concerned . * * we allow unstable dynamics in the family of systems .",
    "although this is not the first instance that stability of a discrete - time switched linear system containing unstable dynamics in the family has been considered , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first instance when a stabilizing switching signal for a discrete - time switched linear system containing unstable subsystems , is proposed _",
    "solely _ in terms of asymptotic behaviour of the switching signal .",
    "* we develop conditions for existence of switching signals having the properties that we propose .",
    "these conditions are algorithmic in nature , and can be readily tested for a given switched system . * we provide an algorithmic procedure for synthesis of switching signals that ensure stability of discrete - time switched linear systems .",
    "the analysis and the synthesis carried out in this article can be extended in a standard fashion to include the case of switched nonlinear systems ; we do not strive for maximum generality in terms of applicability of the ideas presented here .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in  [ s : prelim ] we formulate the problem under consideration and elaborate on the properties of the family of systems and the switching signal that we employ in our analysis .",
