    "topological insulators ( tis ) are a new class of materials characterized by a nontrivial topology of the hilbert space spanned by the wave functions of the occupied electronic states @xcite .",
    "they are expected to be useful for various applications including high - frequency electronics , transparent electrodes , spintronics , and quantum computations @xcite .",
    "already a number of bulk materials have been found to be three - dimensional ( 3d ) tis @xcite , and they are all narrow - gap semiconductors composed of heavy elements which cause band inversions @xcite .",
    "when the band inversion occurs at an odd number of the high - symmetry points in the brillouin zone , the topological principle @xcite dictates that charge - conducting gapless states show up on the surface .",
    "hence , 3d tis are peculiar in that they consist of gapped bulk states accompanied by gapless surface states of topological origin .",
    "syntheses of new 3d ti materials are of great current interest for expanding our knowledge about the relationship between chemistry and quantum - mechanical functionalities @xcite .    in this context",
    ", there is an intriguing class of materials whose crystal structures realize a naturally - formed heterostructure consisting of alternating layers of topological insulators and ordinary insulators @xcite ; due to their constructions , such materials can be considered to lie at the boundary between topologically trivial and nontrivial materials .",
    "specifically , in the homologous series of pb - bi - se ternary compounds expressed in the formula ( pbse)@xmath0(bi@xmath3se@xmath4)@xmath5 @xcite , which we call psbs here , layers of pbse ( which is an ordinary insulator ) alternate with layers of bi@xmath3se@xmath4 ( which is a prototypical topological insulator @xcite ) . in these series of compounds , it was inferred from the band structure data obtained from angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) that each internal interface between pbse and bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layers harbor topological interface states , leading to the situation that the whole bulk is filled with quasi - two - dimensional states of topological origin @xcite .",
    "interestingly , since the topological interface states appear on both sides of each bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer sandwiched by pbse layers , the two topological states at the top and bottom interfaces can hybridize _ within _ each bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer , leading to the opening of a gap in the topological states @xcite .",
    "the size of this hybridization gap becomes smaller as the bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer becomes thicker and the hybridization becomes weaker .",
    "based on the electronic structure data obtained from ultrathin films of bi@xmath3se@xmath4 @xcite , it is expected that the hybridization is gone when the bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer becomes thicker than 5 nm .",
    "note that the crystal structure of bi@xmath3se@xmath4 consists of covalently - bonded se - bi - se - bi - se quintuple layers ( qls ) that are interconnected by weak van der waals force @xcite .",
    "the thickness of each ql is 0.9545 nm .",
    "thus , the hybridization of topological states in psbs would disappear when each bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer contains more than 5 qls .    in the ( pbse)@xmath0(bi@xmath3se@xmath4)@xmath5 homologous series ,",
    "the parameter @xmath6 gives the number of qls included in each bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer , and the topological states becomes more robust for larger @xmath6 .",
    "so far , syntheses of compounds with @xmath6 = 1 , 2 , and 3 have been reported @xcite , and it is naively expected that , based on the phase diagram of the pbse - bi@xmath3se@xmath4 pseudo - binary system reported by shelimova _",
    "@xcite , compounds with larger @xmath6 would not be naturally synthesized because they are not thermodynamically stable . despite this naive expectation ,",
    "we have successfully synthesized @xmath6 = 4 compound based on a melt - growth strategy in which the composition of the melt changes continuously as the growth proceeds . the expansion of the available compounds in this interesting homologous series is useful , because one can tune the hybridization of the topological states by changing @xmath6 , which is a unique tunability among topological materials . in this paper , we report the synthesis and analyses of the pb@xmath0bi@xmath1se@xmath2 [ = ( pbse)@xmath0(bi@xmath3se@xmath4)@xmath7 , called psbs @xmath6 = 4 ] compound , as well as its anisotropic transport properties which support the quasi - two - dimensional nature of its electronic states .",
    "the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) analysis using 2@xmath8@xmath8 scan is performed with rigaku ultima - iv x - ray apparatus equipped with a 1d - detector .",
    "for single - crystal x - ray analysis , rigaku mercury ccd system with graphite - monochromated mok@xmath9 radiation is used .",
    "the in - plane transport properties of psbs single crystals are measured by standard ac six - probe method , which allows measurements of the in - plane resistivity @xmath10 and the hall resistivity @xmath11 at the same time . by sweeping the magnetic field up to @xmath122 t",
    ", the linear slope of @xmath11 vs. @xmath13 is obtained , from which the hall coefficient @xmath14 is calculated .",
    "the out - of - plane resistivity @xmath15 is measured by using a four - probe method , in which the current and voltage contacts are made near the edges of the top and bottom surfaces of a rectangular sample . in the present work , @xmath10 and @xmath15",
    "are measured on the same samples to avoid unnecessary complications , and the results from several samples are compared to assess the reproducibility of the anisotropy measurements .",
    "single crystalline samples of psbs with a series of @xmath6 values are grown by a combination of modified bridgman and self - flux methods .",
    "the growth process is complicated , because these compounds do not exhibit congruent melting @xcite . to grow high - quality single crystals , the following steps are taken : high - purity raw material shots of pb ( 99.998% ) , bi ( 99.9999% ) , and se ( 99.999% ) are sealed in a quartz tube that was heat - treated beforehand . for removing oxidization layers formed in air on the raw shots of pb and bi ,",
    "surface cleaning procedures are performed ; pb shots are annealed in hydrogen atmosphere , and bi shots are washed with diluted hno@xmath4 .",
    "based on the phase diagram reported by shelimova _",
    "@xcite , we choose the starting composition of pbse : bi@xmath3se@xmath4 = 45:55 in molar ratio .",
    "the raw materials are reacted and homogenized in a melt held at 1173 k for 6 h , and the crystal growth was fostered by slowly sweeping the temperature from 1023 k to 923 k at a rate of 2 k / hour in a temperature gradient of roughly 1 k / cm . at the beginning of the growth , @xmath6 = 1 crystals are formed at the low - temperature end of the melt , which causes the composition of the melt to become pbse - poor . as the temperature is lowered and the crystals growth proceeds , the melt becomes more and more pbse - poor and the composition of the grown crystals changes from @xmath6 = 1 to higher @xmath6 values .",
    "after cutting the grown boule [ fig .",
    "1a ] with a wire saw , cleavable single crystals can be separated .",
    "the phase of each piece is determined by the 2@xmath8@xmath8 xrd analysis on a cleaved surface .",
    "even when the appearance of the surface is clean and shiny , the xrd profile can sometimes contain peaks from multiple phases ; we discard such multi - phase crystals and only use those crystals that show single - phase peaks on both top and bottom surfaces for further characterizations .",
    "the largest size of the single - phase crystal we obtained was roughly @xmath160.2 mm@xmath17 .",
    "the xrd pattern confirmed that the cleavage plane is along the @xmath18-plane .",
    "note that , because the crystal structures of the psbs homologous series are monoclinic @xcite , the @xmath19-axis is _ not _ perpendicular to the @xmath18-plane , and hence the direction normal to the @xmath18 plane is called @xmath20-axis .",
    "this means that the 2@xmath8@xmath8 xrd profile on a cleaved surface of a psbs single crystal reflects the periodicity along the @xmath20-axis , which corresponds to @xmath21 with @xmath19 and @xmath22 the @xmath19-axis lattice constant and the angle between the @xmath19-axis and the @xmath18-plane , respectively .",
    "the periodicities ( i.e. the @xmath23 values ) for @xmath6 = 1 , 2 , and 3 are obtained in the present experiments to be 1.5795(19 ) , 2.5287(11 ) , and 3.4753(15 ) nm , respectively [ fig .",
    "1b - d and table 1 ] @xcite ; these results are consistent with those previously reported @xcite . however , in addition to these three phases , we found a new phase of unknown xrd profile , as shown in fig .",
    "1e . the crystals of this new phase presents a shiny cleavage plane , and the appearance is indistinguishable from other psbs phases nor the bi@xmath3se@xmath4 compound .",
    "nevertheless , from the xrd profile , the periodicity perpendicular to the cleavage plane is calculated to be 4.4274(15 ) nm , which is very long and is obviously different from any known phase in this pb - bi - se ternary system .",

    "positive @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath32-type .",
    "the expected carrier density @xmath38 is obtained by dividing @xmath37 by the unit - cell volume , and for @xmath6 = 4 , one obtains @xmath39 .",
    "figure 2a shows the temperature dependences of @xmath10 for five samples of psbs @xmath6 = 4 single crystals obtained from the same boule .",

    "the temperature dependences of @xmath40 for the same set of samples are shown in fig .",
    "2b ; the variation of @xmath40 between samples is again about 40% at room temperature .",
    "it is useful to note that the data in fig . 2b",
    "tell us that the sample - to - sample variation in @xmath10 is caused essentially by a change in the carrier density , which is presumably related to different levels of bi antisite defects in different pieces of crystals .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig . 2c , the hall mobility @xmath41 calculated from @xmath10 and @xmath40 for those samples converges at room temperature , indicating that the level of electron scattering is unchanged among samples at room temperature . the carrier density @xmath42 calculated from @xmath40 varies from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , which is smaller than that expected from the density of bi antisites by roughly a factor of two .",
    "a major part of this discrepancy is probably due to the hall factor , which accounts for the difference between the actual carrier density and that calculated from @xmath45 , because the latter can vary due to the multiband effects and the relaxation - time anisotropy .",

    "the temperature dependence is either weakly metallic or almost temperature independent , from which it is difficult to judge whether the transport along the @xmath24-axis is coherent . nevertheless , as shown in fig .",
    "3b , the anisotropy ratio @xmath48 grows with lowering temperature and reaches 75170 at low temperature , which points to the quasi - two - dimensional nature of the transport @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "3c - e the data of @xmath10 , @xmath15 , and @xmath48 for two samples of psbs @xmath6 = 2 single crystals .",
    "one can see that @xmath10 is comparable to that of the @xmath6 = 4 phase , but @xmath15 ( and hence @xmath48 ) is much smaller in the @xmath6 = 2 phase .",
    "thus , the present results suggest that the transport anisotropy increases with increasing @xmath6 in the psbs homologous series .",

    "to understand the implications of the difference in the resistivity anisotropy between @xmath6 = 2 and 4 , it is useful to remember that in bulk bi@xmath3se@xmath4 , which can be viewed as the @xmath49 limit of the psbs homologous series , the anisotropy is as small as @xmath503 @xcite , and this is because bi@xmath3se@xmath4 has a 3d ellipsoidal fermi surface . therefore , the _ increase _ in the anisotropy for larger @xmath6 can not be an indication that the system is approaching the @xmath49 limit .",
    "in other words , the present result on the resistivity anisotropy strongly supports the conjecture that pbse layer in this homologous series works as a block layer for the charge transport .",
    "nevertheless , the volume density of the pbse layer becomes _ smaller _ for larger @xmath6 , and hence the larger @xmath15 value at @xmath6 = 4 can not be due simply to the presence of pbse layers as series resistors .",
    "one possibility to understand the trend in the resistivity anisotropy is to consider that the level of hybridization between the top and bottom interface states of topological origin within each bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer plays an important role in determining the out - of - plane transport .",
    "in such a case , a thicker bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer ( i.e. a larger @xmath6 ) means weaker hybridization , which would lead to smaller transfer integral between top and bottom interface states within the bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer , resulting in a larger @xmath24-axis resistivity .",
    "although speculative , this possibility suggests the importance of the topological interface state in the out - of - plane transport in the psbs homologous series .",
    "we now discuss the chemical reason why it was possible to synthesize the @xmath6 = 4 phase in the present work . according to the phase diagram of the pbse - bi@xmath3se@xmath4 pseudo - binary system reported by shelimova _",
    "@xcite , there are only three stable phases , pb@xmath0bi@xmath51se@xmath52 ( @xmath6 = 1 ) , pb@xmath0bi@xmath7se@xmath53 ( @xmath6 = 2 ) , and pb@xmath0bi@xmath54se@xmath55 ( @xmath6 = 3 ) , which respectively form below 993 , 973 , and 948 k. the phase diagram also suggests that if the bi@xmath3se@xmath4:pbse ratio is higher than that corresponds to @xmath6 = 3 , a mixed phase solidifies below 930 k. however , this phase diagram was constructed from only a finite number of compositional data points , and it is possible that there is a narrow compositional window in which the @xmath6 = 4 phase preferentially grows below some temperature that lies between 930 and 948 k. in our growth method for this homologous series , the composition of the melt changes continuously toward a higher bi@xmath3se@xmath4:pbse ratio as the temperature is lowered and the crystal growth proceeds , which must have brought the system to hit the right composition / temperature window for the @xmath6 = 4 growth . hence , our method is suitable for the growth of rare compounds in a homologous series , although it is difficult to obtain large single crystals for each phase .    finally , it would be useful to elaborate on the difference in the crystal structures of the homologous series obtained for pb - bi - se and pb - bi - te ternary systems .",
    "the pb - bi - te ternary system also gives rise to a homologous series , but its construction is fundamentally different from that obtained for the pb - bi - se ternary system .",
    "namely , in the case of tellurides , although the composition formula is superficially similar to the selenides and is written as ( pbte)@xmath56(bi@xmath3te@xmath4)@xmath57 ( @xmath6 and @xmath32 are integers ) , in this homologous series `` pbte '' is incorporated into the original rhombohedral structure of bi@xmath3te@xmath4 , forming a covalently - bonded te - bi - te - pb - te - bi - te septuple - layer unit @xcite .",
    "hence , in the telluride homologous series , the rhombohedral symmetry of the crystal structure which stems from a cubic structure distorted along ( 111 ) direction is essentially unchanged from that of bi@xmath3te@xmath4 .",
    "importantly , the @xmath58 phase of this telluride homologous series , pbbi@xmath3te@xmath59 , which simply consists of a stack of the te - bi - te - pb - te - bi - te septuple - layers , is known to be a topological insulator @xcite ; hence , the telluride homologous series is a heterostructure of two topological insulators ( i.e. pbbi@xmath3te@xmath59 and bi@xmath3te@xmath4 ) and the topological states show up only on the surrounding surface .",
    "in contrast , in the selenide homologous series @xcite , pbse is not incorporated into the rhombohedral structure of bi@xmath3se@xmath4 and the rock - salt structure of bulk pbse partly remains , forming the pbse layer of square symmetry ; this layer alternates with the bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layer of hexagonal symmetry , and the resulting structure is no longer rhombohedral . as is already emphasized ,",
    "this selenide homologous series is a heterostructure of a topological insulator and an ordinary insulator , and hence its electronic nature is fundamentally different from that of the telluride homologous series .",
    "we have synthesized a new compound in the ( pbse)@xmath0(bi@xmath3se@xmath4)@xmath5 homologous series with @xmath6 = 4 , which became possible by using a melt - growth method in which the composition of the melt changes continuously to allow the whole series of compounds to grow in a sequential manner . this new compound , pb@xmath0bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , is a member of the unique family of topological materials in which alternating layers of the topological insulator bi@xmath3se@xmath4 and the ordinary insulator pbse form natural heterostructures , leading to the appearance of topological interface states throughout the bulk .",
    "the trend in the @xmath24-axis resistivity and the resistivity anisotropy with increasing @xmath6 values suggests that the hybridization of the topological interface states plays an important role in the out - of - plane transport in this compound .",
