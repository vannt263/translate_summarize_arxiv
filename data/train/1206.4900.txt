    "similarly , the noise - free r - se formulation can easily detect the presence of bad data if the minimum achievable is non - zero .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the role of the outlier vector s @xmath65-norm in the r - se criterion , in identifying the presence of bad data , or , in recovering the true state even when bad data are present .    a critical attribute for an observable ( identifiable ) outlier vector is its maximum sparsity level @xmath88 ( respectively @xmath89 ) .",
    "to appreciate this , consider the two broad classes that outliers typically come from .",
    "the first class includes bad data emerging due to faulty meters , telemetry errors , or software bugs , which generally occur rarely , that is with low probability ; see e.g. , @xcite and references therein . here , @xmath88 quantifies the maximum number of bad data that can be revealed with high probability ; while @xmath89 denotes the maximum number of outlying meters that can be identified so that recovery of the true state becomes feasible .",

    "even though @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) is useful for assessing the degree of outlier observability ( identifiability ) , deciding whether a given vector @xmath73 is observable or identifiable for the nonlinear ac model is challenging , except for the trivial case @xmath90 . fortunately , it is possible to obtain @xmath88 and @xmath89 by leveraging the notion of the measurement distance for any nonlinear function @xmath72 , as defined next .",

    ", the hamming distance characterizes the minimum difference between any two strings that lie in the mapped space , and it can be easily computed for fixed problem dimensions . however , for the r - se problem of interest , @xmath33 is drawn from the complex field @xmath94 , while the mapping @xmath72 is quadratic .",
    "compared to the hamming distance it will be generally very challenging to compute @xmath95 in .",
