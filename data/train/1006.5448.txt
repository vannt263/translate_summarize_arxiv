    "variations in the position of the interface are characterized by two length scales .",
    "the rms fluctuations are a measure of the vertical extent of the roughness , while the correlation length contains information about its horizontal spread .",

    "et al _ @xcite using scanning tunneling microscopy , who found a correlation length of 23 - 26 nm . even small amplitude rms fluctuations can result in short time scales for mixing valley - split levels , since the wave vectors of the bottoms of the two valleys correspond to very short length scales ( @xmath4 in si ) .",
    "all the above works have concentrated on variations in the position of the interface .",
    "variations in the size of the potential step , that is , the _ local roughness _ , have not been studied to date .    in this article",
    "we extend the ema to study the effect of interface roughness on multivalley qds .",
    "the approach adopted in this work is equivalent to that of ref .",
    ", except that an analytical wave function is used here rather than one determined numerically .",
    "our theory is applicable provided that fluctuations in the location of the interface are much smaller than the spatial extent of the 2deg , and the fluctuations in the magnitude of the interface potential step are small compared to its average value .",
    "we demonstrate that interface roughness has two main effects : it suppresses the valley - orbit coupling and gives rise to tunneling between valley eigenstates in certain dynamical processes in multidot systems .",
    "our starting point is the effective mass approximation in the presence of valleys,@xcite with a modified hamiltonian incorporating interface roughness . our model of roughness accounts for variations in the position of the interface and variations in the magnitude of the interface potential step .",
    "for one electron on one dot ( _ 1e1d _ ) we study the way interface roughness enters the expression for @xmath3 .",

    "the size of this tunneling matrix element can not be controlled , although it can be measured experimentally .",
    "the findings of this work are general , yet when concrete examples are called for we will discuss qds made in a si / sio@xmath0 mosfet structure , which are actively studied in quantum information .",
    "it should be pointed out that the long spin coherence time in si and the possibility of further enhancing the spin coherence time using isotopic purification , which eliminates the @xmath5si nuclei , give si an enormous advantage for quantum information processing . in addition",
    ", the dominant si - based semiconductor technology allows , in principle , for scalability with the real hope that once a few si spin qubits are demonstrated in the laboratory , many qubits could be developed without great difficulties .",
    "these ( i.e. long spin coherence time and scalability ) are the reasons that si spin qubits remain a most active area of research in the context of quantum computation architecture studies . however , the conduction band valleys in si , which are degenerate in the simplest effective mass approximation , cause considerable difficulties in fabricating si spin qubits since the electron spin by itself does not define the state of a si electron .",
    "this is the context in which our detailed theoretical study in this work has been undertaken .",
    "the ultimate goal is to help understand the role of valleys in si spin quantum computation , in particular , to see if the interface roughness naturally present at the si surface could somehow be utilized to circumvent or even control the si spin qubit valley degeneracy problem .",

    "the final result varies significantly as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "an interface may be observed to be sharp and of a high quality , yet the transition layer between two materials still always has a finite width .",
    "the atoms on the two sides of the interface have different bonding , as do the atoms at the interface .",
    "for example between si on one side and sio@xmath0 on the other there exists a region a few monolayers thick composed of sio@xmath86 , with @xmath87.@xcite consequently , even when the interface is sharp the finite transition layer alters the energy landscape .",

    "the ideal method for dealing with this issue is to use the exact microscopic structure of the interface .",
    "such a treatment is only possible numerically , yet even then the interface structure is not known exactly and , when one of the materials is amorphous , it can only be dealt with approximately and/or statistically .",
    "therefore , there exists a scope for gaining analytical insight by refining the effective mass approximation to include the effects of interface roughness . within the ema",
    "the interface is modeled in such a way that the atomic structure is smoothed out , and an effective mass appropriate for the insulator is used . in the same way as the smoothness requirement can be relaxed as long as the region under study is a few monolayers away from the interface , one can also relax the requirement that the interface be sharp and flat .",
    "corrections to this picture can be made so that the location of the interface varies on an atomic scale but with an amplitude much smaller than the effective size of the confinement .",
    "then the @xmath7-motion and the @xmath2-motion are still approximately separable . beyond this refinement",
    ", a random potential is added to allow the _ magnitude _ of the interface step to fluctuate .",
    "these two features can be regarded as corrections to the effective mass picture , which is entirely based on bulk parameters .",

    "the breakdown of the perturbative expansion is most emphatically manifest in section [ sec : long ] , when long interface correlations are considered , yet the expansion is also not valid if the @xmath92-correlations span a small spatial scale , as section [ sec : short ] demonstrates .",

    "we treat @xmath99 perturbatively , since we expect @xmath100 , but we do not do perturbation theory in @xmath101 . in this problem the criterion for smallness is generally nontrivial .",
    "the discussion of this criterion will follow naturally after the analytical expressions for the effect of the roughness are presented .    aside from variations in the location of the interface ,",
    "sources of roughness include dangling bonds , impurities , and variations in bond length in the vicinity of the interface .",
    "all of these contribute to the local roughness @xmath99 .",
    "we expect , however , that variations in bond length will occur on the atomic length scale , which is orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial extent of a quantum dot .",
    "this implies that the effect of bond length fluctuations averages to zero over the quantum dot and is washed out .",
    "we do not consider it explicitly in what follows .",

    "it is assumed that the fluctuations around @xmath107 are small compared to @xmath76 , which represents the spatial scale over which the wave function changes by a significant amount in the @xmath1-direction ( i.e. the size of the confinement . )",
    "the spatial scale of the roughness divided by the spatial scale over which the wave function changes significantly is an important parameter .",
    "the size of this parameter in comparison to unity determines the applicability of the ema .",
    "it is necessary for @xmath108 to be small , so that the potential acting on the charge carriers remains approximately separable and use of the effective mass approximation is justified . if @xmath109 the fluctuation in the @xmath2-direction is considerably less than the spatial extent in all three directions , so that the wave function is still approximately separable in @xmath110 .",
    "this condition must be augmented by a formal criterion according to which the potential is weak . in principle",
    "all applied electric fields , such as @xmath9 in this problem , violate the criterion for being weak , since the potential @xmath111 eventually becomes large on any scale relevant to the problem once @xmath2 exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "this fact however is not usually a problem as long as the potential @xmath13 does not vary too fast on lattice length scales , that is , as long as @xmath112 is significantly smaller than the average atomic potential in a unit cell .",
    "to summarize , the ema should remain valid as long as the random potential @xmath100 for all @xmath113 and the fluctuations in the location of the interface are much smaller than the spatial extent of the 2deg .",
    "we use the notation @xmath71 for the unperturbed valley - orbit coupling in the absence of interface roughness , which is the same on both dots .",

    "we recall that in si the contribution to @xmath3 due to one wave vector , namely @xmath66 , overwhelms all the others .",
    "therefore a good indication of the effect of interface roughness is given by the averages @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the appearance of the simple exponential oscillatory terms such as @xmath118 is a consequence of the fact that we are using the effective mass approximation . in a more complicated numerical treatment",
    "we still expect a strong dependence on @xmath122 , though it will likely not be expressible as a simple exponential .",
    "since it is predominantly the term with @xmath66 that contributes to @xmath63 , this quantity should not be affected by the presence of @xmath92 .",

    "we will use _ short _ correlations to refer to spatial correlations of @xmath92 on a scale much smaller than the typical extent of a quantum dot ( approximately 50 nm ) , and _ long _ correlations for spatial correlations of @xmath92 on a scale of the order of or greater than the typical extent of a quantum dot .",
    "the problem of valley - orbit coupling is vastly different for short interface correlations and long interface correlations .",
    "physically , fluctuations associated with a random interface ought to occur on the scale of the lattice constant .",
    "we anticipate that the true physical picture is represented by short correlations , but given the existing uncertainty we will study both cases in this paper",
    ".    in the most general case the valley - orbit coupling may be different on the two dots .",
    "since the valley - orbit coupling is a complex number , in principle one should expect both the amplitude and the phase to be different between the two dots .",
    "this fact is not of much significance when a sharp flat interface is considered , yet is of enormous importance when interface roughness is concerned .",
    "in addition , roughness is expected to show significant sample dependence . in double quantum dots in different samples",
    "the roughness profile on the left dot may be qualitatively similar to or very different from the roughness profile on the right dot .",

    "this results in unambiguous initialization , regardless of the magnitude of the valley splitting , and is easily accomplished experimentally since @xmath249 in si . under these circumstances one needs to consider only the manifold of @xmath247 states , which comprises five wave functions .",

    "this process represents a coherent rotation of valley eigenstates .",
    "we note that for _ rapid _ adiabatic passage ( i.e. fast compared to @xmath264 ) the effect of roughness is analogous to a renormalization of the spectrum , which remains qualitatively the same , and valley eigenstates are not mixed .",
    "however for slow adiabatic passage valley eigenstates can be mixed . in effect",
    "one can use interface roughness to manipulate valleys in the same way the inhomogeneous nuclear field was used to manipulate spin singlet and triplet states.@xcite",

    ", it follows that in general both @xmath272 and @xmath189 are nonzero , and their ratio will depend on the relative positions of the two dots .",
    "since the spatial scale set by @xmath275 is approximately 0.5@xmath191 , this ratio can vary drastically from one sample to another , and in any one sample it is in effect a random number , which only experiment can determine reliably .",

    "we single out two important possibilities : ( a ) @xmath276 and ( b ) @xmath277 . in case ( a )",

    "the levels of the left dot are subsequently held fixed while the levels of the right dot are scanned .",
    "the next peak in the resonant tunneling current should then give @xmath189 .",
    "in addition to providing values for the tunneling parameters , such an experiment should also give a good indication of the length scale characterizing interface roughness correlations .",
    "if @xmath189 is close to zero it indicates that the correlation length of interface roughness is either much smaller than the size of a quantum dot or much larger than it . on the other hand ,",

    "two potential risks are associated with such a resonant tunneling experiment .",
    "firstly , if the valley splitting is smaller than the typical broadening of the current peaks , then the signals due to @xmath272 and @xmath189 may merge into one peak . in this case",

    "secondly , it may happen that one sample will have @xmath279 within experimental error .",
    "aside from the fact that such a risk is small , it can be overcome by performing the experiment on several samples . furthermore , since @xmath280 is expected to be smaller than the confinement energy , the two tunneling parameters can be unambiguously identified .",
    "our analysis makes evident the fact that the length scale characterizing interface roughness correlations plays an important role in determining the effect of roughness on the valley - orbit coupling and intervalley dynamics of double quantum dots .",
    "the two possible scenarios , interface correlations of the order of the lattice constant and greatly exceeding the lattice constant , produce vastly different physics on a qualitative level , as well as quantitatively different results .",

    "once this state is initialized the detuning between the dots is ramped up until this state crosses the next - lowest energy state . at this point",

    "@xmath240 , it is obvious that the lowest energy levels cross in all setups . there is a tunneling matrix element between the two lowest energy levels , which in all three setups have different valley composition .",
    "the time scale for this level mixing is set by the interdot tunneling , in contrast to the weak local roughness case , in which it was set by the local roughness parameter @xmath158 .",
    "on the one hand tunneling can be adjusted by means of the gate that controls the interdot barrier , allowing some experimental control .",
    "when the length scale of interface roughness correlations is of the order of the size of a quantum dot , the magnitude of the valley - orbit coupling will again be slightly different between the two dots , yet its phase can in principle also be different .",
    "the relative phase of the valley - orbit coupling is determined by the value of the function @xmath282 on each dot and , where @xmath275 sets a length scale of @xmath283 .",
    "the relative phase of the valley orbit coupling determines the relative magnitude of interdot tunneling between like valley eigenstates and interdot tunneling between opposite valley eigenstates .",
    "given the random nature of @xmath92 , the extremely short length scale set by @xmath275 and the impossibility of achieving control over such short distances in the foreseeable future , the relative strengths of tunneling between like and opposite valley eigenstates under these circumstances is in effect a random number , expected to vary greatly from one sample to another .",
    "the extreme cases considered , @xmath284 and @xmath276 are rather similar qualitatively .",

    "we have established that the lowest energy levels do cross in all setups , yet the tunneling between them is determined by the relative strength of @xmath272 and @xmath189 . since this is a random number any valley manipulation scheme under these circumstances must be regarded as overly ambitious .",
    "if interface roughness correlations occur on the scale of a quantum dot the valleys are mixed randomly and any attempt at coherent manipulation of valley eigenstates would be futile .",
    "one important result of our study is the fact that variations in the position of the interface ( given by @xmath103 ) and variations in the local roughness ( given by @xmath158 ) influence the valley - orbit coupling and interdot dynamics in vastly different ways .",
    "the length scale of the interface misalignment across a double quantum dot gives rise to two qualitative scenarios : short correlations of interface roughness , over the scale of a few lattice constants , and long correlations of interface roughness , over the scale of a quantum dot .",
    "for short correlations the valley - orbit coupling is suppressed by a factor @xmath196 , with @xmath285 determined by the locations of the valleys in reciprocal space , and @xmath103 the variance of the fluctuations in the interface location . in the absence of local roughness , the valley - orbit coupling in a double quantum dot is the same on each dot . for long correlations",
    "the phase of the valley - orbit coupling can also be different between the two dots , such that interdot tunneling between opposite valley eigenstates is enabled . in this case",
    "the relative phase of the valley - orbit coupling can not be controlled and the relative magnitude of interdot tunneling between like and opposite valley eigenstates is essentially a random variable .",
    "these findings are general and applicable to all systems where valley physics is important .",
    "the analysis presented in this work suggests that the ideal scenario for inducing transitions between valley eigenstates is to use the polarized triplet @xmath247 states in a dqd in which @xmath244 . to determine the time scale for these transitions we need to estimate the magnitude of @xmath158 , or more precisely its variation across a dqd ( which may be due to dangling bonds or impurities",
    ". ) in the absence of experimental data",
    ", it is necessary to estimate the variation in @xmath234 between the two dots .",
    "we assume @xmath286 mev and , to cover a wider range of experimental possibilities , we consider variations in @xmath234 of @xmath287 .",
    "as shown above , knowledge of the difference in @xmath234 enables one to determine the difference in @xmath210 between the dots ( we assume @xmath288 in eq .",
    "[ vsimplified ] , so that the difference in @xmath234 is given by the difference in @xmath210 only . ) moreover , we can use the evaluations of @xmath289 and @xmath234 to infer a series of facts about the matrix elements of @xmath99 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath210 and @xmath290 follow the same pattern as @xmath289 and @xmath234 respectively , except that instead of @xmath291 we have the average of @xmath99 over a quantum dot . therefore , based on the ratio of @xmath234 and @xmath289 ,",
    "we conclude that the ratio of the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath290 to the diagonal matrix element @xmath210 can range between @xmath292 depending on whether sige is used or sio@xmath0 .",
    "we estimate in addition the real part of @xmath290 to be one order of magnitude smaller than the imaginary part .",
    "the roughness average reduces this by another order of magnitude , with a further reduction by an order of magnitude arising from the multiplicative factor @xmath293 .",
    "one ultimately expects @xmath158 in the range @xmath294 nev , giving a time scale of approximately 1 - 10 @xmath243s .",
    "this figure represents the time scale for transitions from one valley eigenstate to another .",
    "gating on such a time scale is easily accomplished experimentally.@xcite      in all scenarios discussed in this work there are three relevant regions of the energy level spectrum as a function of interdot detuning @xmath257 .",
    "these are the two extreme cases @xmath295 , @xmath296 , as well as a third value @xmath257 at which the lowest two energy levels cross , in the cases when such a crossing does occur . for _",
    "1e2d _ in the strong tunneling regime the two lowest energy levels as a function of detuning go through an avoided crossing where their minimum separation is of order @xmath160 .",
    "the matrix element mixing these levels is of order @xmath158 , and since @xmath241 the possibility of mixing these levels by means of interface roughness is remote . for _",
    "2e2d _ in the strong tunneling regime , the lowest singlet states also anticross and can not be mixed , yet two triplet states with different valley compositions cross each other and can be mixed by roughness . in fact transitions between triplet states offer the best prospect of experimental manipulation of the valley degree of freedom using interface roughness . for strong roughness all the above scenarios ( _ 1e2d _ , _ 2e2d _ singlet and triplet states ) are very similar . without interdot tunneling",
    "many energy levels cross , and in the neighborhood of the crossing point the lowest two energy levels can be mixed by @xmath160 . given that the tunneling parameter can be adjusted by means of the gate that controls the barrier between the dots , it can in principle be reduced to a time scale slow enough that a coherent valley experiment is possible with currently achievable gating times .",
    "interface roughness has two principal effects on quantum dots made in materials with multivalley energy spectra .",
    "firstly , it leads to a suppression of the valley - orbit coupling by a factor @xmath297 , where @xmath103 is the variance of the fluctuations in the position of the interface .",
    "secondly , in a double quantum dot it enables transitions between valley eigenstates .",
    "such transitions occur in the dynamics of one and two electrons in a dqd . in the majority of processes discussed , one electron initialized into a particular valley eigenstate on one dot tunnels into the opposite valley eigenstate on the adjacent dot when the detuning between the dots is swept to a certain point of the energy spectrum and appropriate mixing time is allowed .",
    "the position of the mixing point and the value of the mixing time must be determined individually for each configuration  _ 1e1d _ , _ 2e2d _ singlets and _ 2e2d _ triplets , and depends also on the relative magnitude of the local interface roughness and the relevant interdot tunneling matrix element . based on our study of all possible configurations",
    "we conclude that the likeliest system to observe this phenomenon is provided by the triplet states in the _",
    "2e2d _ configuration , which may be reliably initialized and are estimated to mix on a time scale of 1 - 10 @xmath243s .",
    "it must be pointed out that , although the possibility of inducing transitions between valley eigenstates by means of interface roughness discussed in this article is one way of manipulating valleys , the scheme we have presented is not tunable .",
    "instead it must be regarded as a first step in the attempt to achieve coherent control of valley eigenstates .",
