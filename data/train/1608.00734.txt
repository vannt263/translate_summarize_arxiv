    "nonlinear propagation in multimode systems , such as optical fibres and nonlinear optical waveguides , has recently become a topic of considerable interest in view of pushing the inherent limits for information transmission of the communication technologies by space - division multiplexing , exploiting multiple spatial transverse mode channels , and high - speed applications , such as all - optical switching using ultrashort high peak power pulses .",
    "several experiments have demonstrated that there is also significant potential for new spatial and spectral nonlinear effects in multimode fibers@xcite@xmath0@xcite and nonlinear waveguides @xcite .",
    "recently , non - classical light generation has been demonstrated using two - photon interference in a multi - mode nonlinear waveguide as a parametric down - conversion source , controlling the spatial characteristics of the down - conversion process via intermodal dispersion @xcite .",
    "self - localisation optical phenomena in multimode systems are possible as a result of counter - balancing of a combination of dispersive effects : ( i ) material dispersion , due to frequency - dependent dielectric response ; ( ii ) waveguide modes dispersion ; ( iii ) variation of the group velocity of each waveguide mode , and nonlinearity .",
    "for instance in optical fibres , complex envelope multimode solitons have been theoretically predicted in the early @xmath1 @xcite@xmath2 and only very recently experimentally studied @xcite@xmath0 .",
    "nonlinear localisation effects such as soliton trapping@xcite has recently been theoretically demonstrated whereby two solitons in different modes shift their spectra and travel at the same speed in spite of considerable intermodal differential group delay between them . for third - order nonlinear processes such as four - photon mixing , which are not automatically phase matched",
    ", it is possible to use the dispersion of the waveguide modes to compensate for material group dispersion in such a way as to achieve phase matching .",
    "this has been demonstrated by the observation of four - photon mixing in a multimode fibre . in multimode systems",
    "the dominant dispersive effect originates from the difference in the group velocity of each excited mode . under suitable conditions ,",
    "the different modes interact among themselves in such a way as to give rise to a self - localisation mechanism , due to non - resonant ( intermodal cross - phase modulation through kerr nonlinearity ) and/or resonant ( four - wave mixing ) nonlinearities@xcite , that prevents the pulse from broadening as a consequence of modal dispersion .",
    "the concept of a multi - component or vector soliton has been introduced by christodoulides et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of nonlinear optical wave propagation in birefringent kerr media .",
    "it has been shown that birefringent media support solitons that consist of a bound state of two distinct orthogonally polarised solitons .",
    "conversely , bound states of solitons can exist without birefringence and four - wave mixing simply on the basis of mutual trapping induced by cross - phase modulation ( incoherent coupling ) between the circularly polarised light components in kerr media @xcite . in the spatial domain",
    "these solitons can be viewed as a superposition of the fundamental and the higher - order waveguide modes induced by the modes themselves through self- and cross - phase modulations .",
    "recently a number of nonlinear self - localisation phenomena with light - matter wave packets , cavity polaritons , in strongly - coupled planar quantum well semiconductor microcavities @xcite have been demonstrated such as bright polariton solitons @xcite , superfluidity @xcite , pattern formation @xcite , vortices @xcite .",
    "here we show that similar nonlinear self - confinement mechanism takes place when a light - matter wave polariton soliton , rather than an optical soliton , propagates in a microcavity wire .",
    "self - localised light - matter wave packets in multimode polariton systems result from compensation of the polariton modes dispersion and group velocity dispersion of each cavity mode with nonlinearity .",
    "a new nonlinearity component is the intermodal nonlinear coupling that arises from intermodal cross - phase modulation ( through kerr nonlinearity ) and polariton parametric scattering ( polariton four - wave mixing ) .",
    "hence , multi - mode polariton solitons can be viewed as resulting from distribution of the excitation energy over multiple spatial modes and consisting of synchronized , non - dispersive pulses in multiple spatial modes , interacting via parametric polariton nonlinearity . here",
    ", the dominant dispersive effect originates from the difference in the group velocity of each excited cavity polariton mode .    for the purpose of theoretical description of the ultrashort pulse propagation in multimode waveguides a set of multimode generalised nonlinear schrdinger equations ( mm - gnlse ) , including a range of intermodal nonlinear effects has been derived @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "a tractable simplified form of the mm - gnlse has been recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear polariton dynamics in microcavity wires is generally described by gross - pitaevskii type equations which are obtained as a special case of the mm - gnlse equations when raman , shock and dispersion orders greater than the second contributions are neglected .",
    "in fact , resonant coherent interactions among different modes through brillouin ( involving acoustical phonons ) and raman ( involving optical phonons ) scattering are unlikely to occur because the matching conditions are not generally satisfied and can be neglected @xcite .",
    "hence the resonant nonlinearities will be dominated by four - photon processes , such as polariton parametric scattering ( polariton four - wave mixing ) .    in a recent work",
    "@xcite we found composite multi - mode polariton soliton solutions in 1d microcavity wires that result from the superposition of the fundamental and multiple higher - order co - existing transverse cavity modes .",
    "most recently , similar spatial multi - stability behaviour has been experimentally observed in laterally confined microcavity exciton - polaritons @xcite . unlike single - mode polariton soliton solutions previously found in planar semiconductor microcavities that are stable within the bistability domain , the multimode solitons exhibit more complex multi - stable behaviour . we have previously found inconsistencies between the calculated domains of soliton existence and a peculiar non - monotonous soliton velocity behaviour for different wire widths @xcite , which we were unable to explain within the framework of our full mean - field model . in order to get a deeper insight into the soliton solutions we develop a modal expansion method , expanding the nonlinear polariton modes in the basis of free polariton modes .",
    "the multi - mode analysis helps to investigate in detail conditions , dynamics and stability of coupled soliton formation and identify reliably ranges of soliton existence , which holds benefits for the fabrication technologies targeting novel polaritonic integrated devices based on structured microcavities @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "polariton propagation in multi - mode systems is an interplay of complex nonlinear spatiotemporal phenomena and waveguide imperfections : the pulse effective coherence length is reduced from the strictly infinite coherence length of perfect phase matching by waveguide imperfections . in a parametric scattering process",
    "the pump can be either redistributed between several different polariton modes and stokes signal appears in one of these modes while anti - stokes appears in a different mode , or the pump photons can be in the same mode .",
    "these two cases are referred to as `` mixed - mode pump '' and `` single - mode pump '' processes .",
    "it has been demonstrated that mixed - mode pump processes result in pulses that have much longer coherence lengths than single - mode pump processes @xcite .",
    "this is a key reason for the interest in multi - mode polariton solitons , as they are expected to be more robust and able to propagate over much longer distances without being destroyed in a realistic waveguide with imperfections .",
    "furthermore , as has been pointed out in , they are expected to exhibit novel spatiotemporal dynamics and , like single - mode solitons , may provide a convenient framework for understanding more complex nonlinear phenomena in confined multi - mode polariton systems .",
    "the starting point is our mean - field driven - dissipative gross - pitaevskii model @xcite in a tilted along the wire reference frame , in which , for the sake of generality , we introduce inclined at an angle @xmath3 to the channel pump with in - plane wave vector components , @xmath4 ( fig .
