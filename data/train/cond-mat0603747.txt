    "low - dimensional systems display unusual and striking features as compared to their three - dimensional ( 3d ) counterparts , among which are the enhanced effects of the interactions and the presence of large fluctuations which are responsible for the failure of mean - field approaches .",
    "in addition , especially in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case , it is possible to find exact solutions which greatly help the progress in our understanding of complex , strongly - interacting many - body systems .",
    "low - dimensional atomic quantum gases are one of the frontiers of the current theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "bosonic and fermionic atomic gases constrained to a quasi-1d geometry have already been realized experimentally by trapping atoms in two - dimensional optical lattices @xcite . in the case of bosons",
    "the strongly - repulsive ( known as tonks - girardeau ) regime has been achieved @xcite",
    ". this regime has been fully understood thanks to the knowledge of the exact many - body wavefunction through the mapping of the strongly repulsive , impenetrable bosons onto an ideal gas of fermions subjected to the same external potential @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably , the mapping does not hold only for the ground state , but may be extended to treat time - dependent phenomena and systems at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the model of spin - polarized fermions interacting via strongly attractive odd - wave interactions , which are the 1d analogue of @xmath0-wave interactions in 3d",
    ". this regime might be experimentally reachable by exploiting the so - called confinement - induced resonances ( cir ) , which permit to tune the 1d coupling constant via a 3d feshbach resonance @xcite . in the limit of infinitely strong attractions , known as the fermionic tonks - girardeau ( ftg ) regime",
    ", the many - body wavefunction is known exactly through an inverse fermi - bose mapping which allows to express the fermionic wavefunction in terms of the one of an ideal bose gas @xcite . at the resonance point",
    "we can thus quantitatively address the question of what the structure of the ground state is , and in particular whether the fermions are paired .",
    "this contributes to the understanding of the intermediate , strongly - interacting region in the 1d equivalent of the bcs - bec crossover for @xmath0-wave fermions .    in a previous work @xcite",
    "we have studied the issue of pairing for a homogeneous ftg gas in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have found that there is off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) in the reduced two - body density matrix , indicating a paired state .",
    "we consider here the experimentally - relevant case of a gas with a finite number of particles and subjected to a longitudinal harmonic confinement .",
    "we derive an an exact analytic expression for the two - body density matrix of the trapped gas and both by variational estimates and by numerical diagonalization we show that also in the presence of the trap odlro persists , yielding a complex , partially paired quantum state .",
    "we consider an atomic spin - polarized fermi gas confined by a tight atom waveguide of which it occupies the transverse ground state .",
    "we shall henceforth assume that the level spacing in the transverse direction is much larger than all the relevant energy scales in the problem ( such as chemical potential , temperature , etc . ) , so that the gas is effectively one - dimensional .",
    "we also consider the case of a gas subjected to a much weaker longitudinal harmonic confinement of frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the 1d hamiltonian is @xmath4 + \\sum_{1\\le j<\\ell\\le n}v_\\text{int}^{\\text{f}}(x_{j}-x_{\\ell})+\\sum_{j}\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^{2}x_{j}^2\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a short - range attractive two - body interaction which is specified here below . since the spatial wave function is antisymmetric due to the spin polarization , there is no zero - range @xmath6-wave ( delta function ) interaction , but it has been shown @xcite that a strong , attractive , and short - range odd - wave interaction ( a 1d analog of 3d @xmath0-wave interactions ) occurs in the neighborhood of the cir . such an interaction can be expressed through a contact condition for the relative wavefunction @xmath7 of each pair of fermions as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the 1d fermionic coupling constant , which can be expressed in terms of the 3d @xmath0-wave scattering volume @xcite .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : contact ] ) above , together with the antisymmetry condition @xmath10 on the relative wavefunction leads to a solution for @xmath7 which is discontinuous at the contact point @xmath11 but has a continuous first derivative .",
    "the ftg gas corresponds to the negative side of the cir , that is , the case where @xmath12 ; in the ftg limit the first derivative of the relative wavefunction @xmath7 equals to zero at @xmath11 . for",
    "the sake of illustration , let us consider first two particles under harmonic confinement .",
    "in the presence of such a confinement the schroedinger equation can be solved exactly for any value of the coupling strength @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the relative wavefunction @xmath7 in the ftg limit takes the value @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where we have set @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the solution for @xmath17 can be extended to arbitrary particle numbers @xmath2 , so that the exact fermionic tg gas ground - state wavefunction is @xcite @xmath18 with where @xmath19 is the `` unit antisymmetric function '' employed in the original discovery of fermionization @xcite and @xmath20 is the ground - state orbital of the longitudinal harmonic confinement",
    ". hence , the ftg gas is mapped through the function @xmath21 to the ground state of an ideal bose gas under harmonic confinement , of which it shares all the properties that do not depend on the sign of the many - body wavefunction , such as the density profile and the spectrum of collective excitations .",
    "in order to explore the pairing properties of the ftg gas we study the two - body reduced density matrix , defined as @xmath22 as it was discussed by yang @xcite , the criterion for `` superconductive '' off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) in a trapped system is that the largest eigenvalue @xmath23 of the two - body density matrix is of the order of the number of particles @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the pair - condensate fraction .    using the exact form ( [ eq : psif ] ) of the many - body wavefunction , the integration over @xmath26 variables in eq .",
    "( [ defrho2 ] ) can be explicitly performed and we obtain an analytic expression for the two - body density matrix , which reads @xmath27^{n-2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are @xmath30 in ascending order , and @xmath31 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath32 and eigenfunctions @xmath33 of the two - body density matrix are the solutions of the integral equation @xmath34 if @xmath17 then @xmath35 , the two - body density matrix separates trivially and has only one nonzero eigenvalue @xmath36 , with eigenfunction @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath38 we have found by numerical integration that the ansatz @xmath39 $ ] satisfies the above eigenvalue equation to within @xmath40 with eigenvalue @xmath41 ( the same as for @xmath17 ) , and we conjecture that these expressions are exact .",
    "for @xmath42 we have numerically solved the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : eig ] ) by diagonalization .",
    "the results for the largest eigenvalue are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "the obtained values agree with the analytical expression @xmath45 to within the computational accuracy of a few percent @xcite , indicating that in the trap a partial odlro is present .",
    "the eigenfunctions corresponding to the largest eigenvalues obtained by numerical diagonalization are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] along with the analytical eigenfunctions for @xmath17 and @xmath46 .     of the two - body density matrix for a harmonically trapped fermionic tg gas at various particle numbers",

    "as in is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the results are very close to the numerical eigenvalues , indicating that the ansatz is a good guess for the exact solution .",
    "there is however some small difference , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by comparing the above ansatz with the numerically determined eigenfunctions in the case @xmath43 .     of the two - body density matrix ( upper curve when @xmath53 ) and variational ansatz @xmath54 ( lower curve when @xmath53 ) for the case @xmath43 . in the case",
    "@xmath38 ( not plotted ) the two curves ( on the same scale ) would be indistinguishable . , width=283 ]    finally , it is interesting to estimate the behaviour of the two - body density matrix in the thermodynamic limit , defined as the limit @xmath55 keeping the central density @xmath56 constant . in that case eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho2 ] ) takes the same form as in the homogeneous system @xcite and hence it follows that @xmath57 ( apart from terms decaying exponentially with pair separation ) , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the estimate in the thermodynamic limit agrees to order @xmath60 with the numerical solution .",
    "in summary , by estimating the largest eigenvalue of the two - body reduced density matrix we have investigated the possibility of off - diagonal long - range order for a fermionic tonks - girardeau gas subjected to a longitudinal harmonic confinement .",
    "the result of variational approach and numerical diagonalization together with an estimate in the thermodynamic limit is that the largest eigenvalue @xmath23 is of order @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the particle number , and hence we find a partial odlro .",
    "the value @xmath61 might also be interpreted as the fraction of pairs which are bose - einstein condensed in the one - dimensional equivalent of the bcs to bec crossover for @xmath0-wave fermions .",
    "the emerging picture is the one of a partially paired quantum state , where quantum fluctuations play a major role in depleting the `` bec '' of pairs .",
    "the consequences of pairing remain to be explored .",
