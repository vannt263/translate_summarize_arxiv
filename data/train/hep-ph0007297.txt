    "understanding the light - quark baryon spectrum and the electromagnetic transition amplitudes from the nucleon ground state to the excited states provides insight into the spatial structure and the spin structure of the nucleon . in this domain",
    ", constituent quarks and glue rather than elementary quarks and gluons appear to be the prevalent degrees of freedom .",
    "however , there is evidence that hadronic degrees - of - freedom are important as well , and there exists a well - known phenomenological connection to the valence quark regime in deep - inealstic scattering , known as bloom - gilman duality . in order to put the resonance region on the solid footing of qcd",
    ", the relative importance of these degrees of freedom as a function of the distance scales must be examined .",
    "photo- and electroproduction of mesons from nucleons provide the most direct information about the spatial and spin structure of the excited states .",
    "the following are areas where the lack of high quality data is most noticeable , and where data from clas will contribute significantly .    * to understand the internal nucleon structure",
    ", we need to study the full excitation spectrum as well as the continuum .",
    "while the continuum has been studied extensively , none of the resonance transitions have been studied well over a large enough distance scale .",
    "* the known spectrum appears rather incomplete when compared with our most accepted constituent quark models @xcite .",
    "many states are missing from the spectrum , and some masses of well known states are not well reproduced . *",
    "the role of the glue in the baryon excitation spectrum is completely unknown , although gluonic excitations of the nucleon are expected to be produced copiously @xcite , and predictions of hybrid baryon masses and quantum numbers are available from bag models @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , and flux tube model @xcite estimates . *",
    "the nucleon spin structure has been explored for more than two decades at high energies .",
    "the nucleon resonance region which gives dominant contributions to the spin structure functions and sum rules at small @xmath0 @xcite , and the transition to the deep inelastic regime have hardly been explored at all . *",
    "the long - known connection between the deep inelastic regime and the resonance region ( parton - hadron duality ) @xcite remained virtually unexplored in its potential to obtain a better understanding of the nucleon structure .",
    "all these topics are currently studied at jlab , many employing the clas detector @xcite .",
    "i will focus exclusively on the resonance region and the first preliminary data from clas that begin to elucidate some of these aspects of nucleon structure .",
    "the lowest excitation of the nucleon is the @xmath1 , the ground state of the isospin 3/2 spectrum .",
    "the electromagnetic excitation is dominanted by a quark spin flip corresponding to a magnetic dipole transition @xmath2 .",
    "this contribution is well known up to fairly large @xmath0 .",
    "the current interest is in probing the small electric ( @xmath3 ) and scalar quadrupole ( @xmath4 ) transitions .",
    "these are sensitive to possible deformations of the nucleon or the @xmath1 from spherical symmetry .",
    "contributions at the few percent level to the ratios @xmath5 and @xmath6 may result from interactions with the pion cloud at large and intermediate distances @xcite .",
    "quark models that include hyperfine interaction from one - gluon exchange predict small contributions as well @xcite .",
    "an intriguing prediction is that in the hard scattering limit the electric quadrupole contribution should be equal in strength to the magnetic dipole contribution @xcite .",
    "an analysis @xcite of earlier desy data found small nonzero values for @xmath7 at @xmath8 , showing that the hard scattering limit may be approached only at much larger values of @xmath0 than currently accessible .    a recent experiment at jefferson lab @xcite measured @xmath9 production in the @xmath1 region at high momentum transfer , and found values for @xmath10 at @xmath11 .",
    "the focus with clas is on the low to medium @xmath0 regime , where data are sensitive to ingredients in nucleon structure models .",
    "the @xmath12 is particularly suited to measure the @xmath13 transition multipoles .",
    "complete distributions in the @xmath9 azimuthal and cms polar angle have been measured over the hadronic mass range from threshold up to w = 1.6 gev in a range in momentum transfer @xmath14gev@xmath15 .",
    "the data have been analysed using different approaches which give consistent results @xcite .",
    "preliminary results for @xmath7 and @xmath16 are shown in figure [ fig : e2m1 ] and [ fig : s2m1 ] , and compared with recent model calculations .",
    "@xmath7 is small and negative , with a weak @xmath0 dependence , while @xmath16 exhibits a strong @xmath0 dependence with a trend towards increasingly negative values .",
    "the trend of the data is qualitatively described by quark models that include pion degrees of freedom .",
    "these results are in contrast to previous data which show no clear @xmath0 dependence of @xmath16 , and do give ambiguous results for the sign of @xmath7 .",
    "= 7.9truecm = 7.9truecm    = 7.9truecm = 7.9truecm",
    "the internal structure of the @xmath17 has been the subject of an intensive debate in recent years .",
    "it is clearly visible as a resonant state in @xmath18 and @xmath19 scattering .",
    "however , its transition strength drops rapidly with @xmath0 in electroproduction @xcite , and its longitudinal coupling is weak . neither of these properties is well described in non - relativistic constituent quark models which assign the state to a radial excitation of the nucleon .",
    "moreover , its mass is lower than most models would predict .",
    "models trying to explain these features range from assigning a large gluonic component @xcite , using light - cone kinematics @xcite , including strong meson cloud effects @xcite , to describing it as a molecular - type bound system of a nucleon and a @xmath20 pseudo - particle @xcite . a clear distinction between a gluonic model for the roper , and meson cloud models , as well as light - cone models , is that the latter ones all predict a zero crossing of @xmath21 while the gluonic model does not .",
    "moreover , the scalar amplitude @xmath22 should be 0 for a gluonic roper , while it is large for other models .",
    "= 8.0 cm = 15.5 cm    although these models may qualitatively explain the fast drop of the transverse transition amplitude with @xmath0 , calculations exist only for the first two models .",
    "they make quite distinct predictions regarding the @xmath0 dependence as shown in figure [ fig : roper ] .",
    "while recent flux tube model calculations @xcite give higher masses to gluonic ( hybrid ) baryons than previous estimates in the bag model @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite , the roper could still have a substantial gluonic component due to mixing with higher mass gluonic states @xcite .",
    "studying these transitions in electroexcitation allows us to probe the internal structure and reveal the true nature of this state .",
    "single @xmath23 and @xmath24 production as well as @xmath25 data from clas are currently being analyzed to determine the transition amplitudes in a large range of @xmath0 .",
    "= 20.0truecm = 3.5truecm",
    "the total photoabsorption cross section shows only 3 or 4 enhancements ; however , more than 20 states are known in the mass region up to 2 gev . by measuring the electromagnetic transition of many of these states",
    "we obtain a more complete picture of the nucleon structure , and provide the basis for testing symmetry properties of resonance transitions and the underlying 3-quark symmetry group structure .",
    "for example , the approximate su(6 ) symmetry of the non - relativistic symmetric quark model predicts relationships between transition amplitudes of states belonging to the same @xmath26 supermultiplets .",
    "for example , in the single - quark - transition model ( sqtm ) , only one quark participates in the interaction .",
    "the model predicts transition amplitudes for a large number of states based on a few measured amplitudes @xcite . at the photon point",
    "the symmetry relations are in good agreement with the data , showing that symmetry properties dominate over differences in the internal quark - gluon structure of different states .",
    "if the nucleon is probed at smaller distances , we expect symmetry properties to become less important .",
    "the current situation is shown in figure [ fig : sqtm ] , where the sqtm amplitudes for the transition to the @xmath27 $ ] supermultiplet have been extracted from the measured amplitudes for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "predictions for other states belonging to the same multiplet are shown in the other panels @xcite .",
    "the lack of accurate data for most resonances prevents a sensitive test of the sqtm for space - like photons .",
    "= 10.5truecm = 7.9truecm    = 10.5truecm = 7.9truecm    the goal of the experimental n * program at jlab with the clas detector is to provide data in the entire resonance region , by measuring many channels in a large kinematic range , including various polarization observables .",
    "the yields of several channels , recorded simultaneously in clas , are shown in figure [ fig : yields ] and figure [ fig : deltapi ] .",
    "resonance excitations seem to be present in all channels .",
    "the graphs also illustrate how the various channels have sensitivity to different resonance excitations .",
    "for example , the @xmath30 channel clearly shows resonance excitation near 1720 mev while single pion production is more sensitive to a resonance near 1680 mev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 channel seems to show resonance excitation near threshold , similar to the @xmath32 channel .",
    "no resonance has been observed in this channel so far .",
    "the single pion channels are essential for an accurate determination of many transition amplitudes .",
    "for the first time , @xmath33 electroproduction has been measured throughout the resonance region , and in a nearly complete angle range .",
    "new data have been obtained in the channel @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath32 channel selects isopin 1/2 resonances , and is particularly sensitive to the @xmath35 state .",
    "preliminary data from clas are shown in figure [ fig : s11 ] .",
    "the data confirm the previously observed , and not fully understood , slow fall - off of the resonance transition form factor with @xmath0 .",
    "however , at low @xmath0 , the trend of the data favors a larger photocoupling amplitude for that state than the @xmath36 data point indicates .",
    "one should note that meson cloud effects can give different results for @xmath37 or @xmath38 channels unless the analysis properly accounts for rescattering and coupled channel effects .",
    "= 11.5truecm    for the first time the @xmath25 channel has been measured with high statistics in photo - and electroproduction .",
    "using an isobar model approach one can study contributions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 decay channels @xcite which are especially sensitive to the so - called missing resonances .",
    "figure [ fig : deltapi ] illustrates the vast improvement in data volume for the @xmath30 channel .",
    "the top panel shows desy data taken more than 20 years ago .",
    "the other two panels show samples of the data taken so far with clas . at higher @xmath0 ,",
    "resonance structures , not seen before in this channel , are revealed .",
    "= 13.0 cm = 15.5 cm",
    "with large acceptance detectors such as clas more complex final states can be studied than has been possible in the past . this will allow us to systematically tackle a longstanding problem , the so - called `` missing resonances '' .",
    "these are states predicted in the symmetric @xmath41 model to populate the mass region around 2 gev but have not been seen in @xmath42 elastic scattering , which is our main source of information on the nucleon excitation spectrum .",
    "these states may thus be either absent from the spectrum , or they may not couple to the @xmath37 channel .",
    "it is important to search for at least some of these states since their absence from the spectrum would be evidence that su(6 ) symmetry is strongly violated in light - quark baryon spectroscopy .",
    "other symmetry scheme have been considered .",
    "for example , the observed clustering of baryon states may reflect an underlying lorentz - isospin group symmetry @xmath43 , as discussed recently in ref .",
    "the number of states is significantly reduced in this latter approach compared to the symmetric model , more in accordance with the observed spectrum . as these possibilities reflect very different underlying baryon structure models , it is extremely important to search for states that are predicted in one scheme but not in the other .",
    "how do we search for states that do not couple to the @xmath42 channel ?",
    "channels which are predicted to couple strongly to `` missing '' states are @xmath44 or @xmath40 .",
    "some may also couple to @xmath45 or @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "some of the `` missing '' states may also couple to @xmath47 , and should therefore be excited in photo- or electroproduction experiments .",
    "figure [ fig : omega ] shows very preliminary data from clas in the @xmath31 channel .",
    "the process is expected to be dominated by t - channel @xmath23 exchange with strong peaking at forward @xmath48 angles , or low t , and a monotonic fall - off at large t. the data show clear deviations from the smooth fall - off for the w range near 1.9 gev , where some of the `` missing '' resonances are predicted , in comparison with the high w region .",
    "although indications for resonance production are strong , analysis of more data and a partial wave study are needed before definite conclusions can be drawn .",
    "clas has collected  @xmath49 @xmath46 events in photoproduction .",
    "production of @xmath50 has also been observed in electron scattering for the first time with clas .",
    "this channel may provide a new tool in the search for missing states as well @xcite .",
    "the quark model predicts two resonances in this mass range with significant coupling to the @xmath51 channel @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 or @xmath53 production may yet be another source of information on resonant states .",
    "previous data show some evidence for resonance production in these channels @xcite .",
    "new data with much higher statistics are being accumulated with the clas detector , both in photo- and electroproduction .",
    "analysis of the @xmath54 polarization provides additional information sensitive to resonance excitations .",
    "the experimental effort with clas at jefferson lab will provide the community with a wealth of data in the first decade of this new millennium to address many open problems in hadronic structure in the domain of nucleon resonances and at intermediate distances . _",
    "the experimental effort must be accompanied by a significant theoretical effort to translate this into real progress in our understanding of the complex regime of strong interaction physics . _",
    "the region of nucleon resonances is of special interest as it represents a domain where different degrees of freedom , from hadronic , to constituent quarks , to valence quarks , overlap . on the one hand , this provides a challenge to theory , on the other hand an opportunity , as only under such circumstances can there be a realistic possibility for a unified description of hadron structure from small to large distances .",
