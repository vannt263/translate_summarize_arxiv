    "transitional and pre - transitional disks are characterised by a flux deficit in the near - infared wavelengths with respect to a classic protoplanetary disk but otherwise have a similar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the accepted explanation for the deficit is a lack of optically thick material in part or all of the inner accretion disk @xcite .",
    "pre - transitional disks have a gap in the accretion disk with hot optically thick material on the inside , while transitional disks have a complete hole and no detectable hot component to the sed @xcite .",
    "the origin of the gap or hole in transitional objects is debated and many hypotheses have been suggested , such as particle growth @xcite , photoevaporation @xcite , and magnetorotational instability @xcite . however , none of these processes can create the largest holes and gaps observed such as those observed in gm aur , dm tau , and sao 206462 , which are tens of au in radius @xcite .",
    "this leads us to another very interesting hypothesis for the origin of the interuption in the protoplanetary accretion disk , namely , embedded planetary object(s ) .",
    "the largest holes and gaps require multiple embedded giant planets to explain their extreme size @xcite but many other less extreme transitional objects are consistent with one embedded , unobserved giant planet @xcite .",
    "transitional systems are all young ( @xmath0 myr ) , thus , if there is an undetected giant planet in the system there should also be a background planetesimal population .",
    "the orbits of the background population of planetesimals will be perturbed by the planet @xcite , increasing collision frequency in regions close to the embedded planet .",
    "dust created will be visible as long as the planetesimals remain collisionally active .",
    "this second  generation dust will augment any primordial dust in both the outer gas  rich disk and the inner gas  poor hole by some fraction that is dependent on the survival time of second generation dust grains . in any disk where planet formation is in progress , second  generation dust",
    "will significantly enhance the dust  grain population . in this letter",
    "we present a search for observational signatures of dust produced by planetesimals under the influence of a giant planet .",
    "we run two sets of n  body simulations of a giant planet embedded in a planetesimal population . in one simulation",
    "set the collision model ( _ rubble _ ) self  consistently treats debris production and in the other set ( _ perfect merging _ ) all planetesimal collisions are inelastic , with an analytical prescription for the size distribution of dust particles .",
    "we then use a radiative transfer code to create synthetic submillimeter images of the dust disk and identify features that change based on the planet orbit .",
    "numerical simulations presented here were calculated using the parallelised n - body gravity code _ pkdgrav _ @xcite .",
    "pkdgrav uses a hierarchical tree to calculate inter - particle gravity and a second order leapfrog integrator for time evolution .",
    "each simulation took between three and six months to complete on 32 2.8 ghz processors .",
    "most simulations begin with @xmath1 equal - mass planetesimals that interact with each other through gravitational forces and physical collisions .",
    "ten simulations were performed in total , in simulations 0 - 8 @xmath1 planetesimals are initially placed in a 3au - wide ring from 0.8 to 3.8 au around a 1 @xmath2 potential .",
    "simulation 9 has lower particle resolution ( @xmath3 ) but a much wider initial disk extending from 0.8 to 10 au .",
    "the embedded planet is placed at 2.8 au , highlighted by a green circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : e0_0_merge_surfd_evo ] .",
    "the total mass of planetesimals is 4.7 m@xmath4 @xcite with a bulk density of 2 g @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "planetesimals are initially distributed such that the surface density decreases with semi - major axis , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "eccentricities and inclinations were drawn from a rayleigh distribution with dispersions @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "table [ table : simic ] gives individual simulation details including the initial embedded planet mass , @xmath8 , the planetary growth time from @xmath8 to one jupiter - mass ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 , the eccentricity of the planet , @xmath11 , and the final stop time in each simulation , @xmath12 .",

    "we investigated two initial mass scenarios for the embedded planet : 1 ) since the final stage of gas - giant planet growth is short ( @xmath13 yrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the planetesimal disk would have little time to respond to the gravitational influence of the planet .",
    "thus , in sim .",
    "03 we began with a fully grown @xmath14 planet ; 2 ) to simulate more realistic scattering from a growing giant planet we also ran several simulations with an embedded planet that increased in mass exponentially from a terrestrial core to @xmath14 over @xmath15 years ( sim .",
    "48 ) , and 460 years ( sim .",
    "9 ) . to grow the planet from a terrestrial - mass embryo to @xmath9 @xmath16 was added at each time step , @xmath17 , to the embryo which had a mass of @xmath18 at time @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the growth constant @xcite .",
    "the average eccentricity of jupiter - mass exoplanets between 1.5 and 10 au from their host star is 0.28 .",
    "thus , the eccentricity of the embedded planet was varied from 0.0 to 0.3 .",
    "a more eccentric planet would create a more dynamically excited and collisionally active planetesimal disk but this may result in a decrease in the planetesimal growth rate and loss of significant mass through collisional grinding .",
    "therefore , it is initially unclear which orbital configuration produces more second - generation dust .",
    "all simulations are in a gas - free disk for a number of reasons : 1 ) planetesimals in these simulations are all initially large ( @xmath21 km ) so aerodynamic gas drag over the simulation time  scale is insignificant ; 2 ) there is observational evidence that the inner hole of a transitional disk has low gas density @xcite ; 3 ) it allows us to isolate the effects of collisional dynamics ; 4 ) in this work dust is the instantaneous collisionally generated second generation dust , not primordial dust that is intimately mixed with the gas .",
    "all simulations used a constant orbital ( major ) time - step of 0.01 years , providing good temporal resolution . however",
    ", minor steps were used in resolving the details of a planetesimal collision in the _ rubble _ model .",
    "two different collision models were used : _ perfect merging _ and _ rubble_. _ perfect merging _ ( sim .",
    "0 - 6 ) treats all collisions as perfectly inelastic collisions and has been used in many numerical simulations due to its simplicity and speed ( i.e. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it does not allow fragmentation or erosion .",
    "this presents two problems : 1 ) collision outcomes may not be realistic ; 2 ) an interpretive procedure is needed to determine where the highest concentration of the `` visible '' dust is located ( see  [ sec : image_dust_distrib ] ) .",
    "thus , in sim .",
    "7 and 8 the _ rubble _ model was used @xcite , which is more complex and realistic but computationally slow .",
    "the _ rubble _ model includes debris production .",
    "however , the _ perfect merging _ collision model does not . in previous work on debris disks @xcite assumed that any collisional debris followed the mass . in his work",
    "each resolved planetesimal represented the massive end of a dohnanyi collisional cascade @xcite .",
    "however , in our simulations the planetesimal disk is not in a steady state ; instead it is rapidly evolving as the young solar system develops .",
    "therefore , a dohnanyi collisional cascade is not applicable .",
    "instead we assume an instantaneous size distribution @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a normalising factor , @xmath24 is the number of objects with a radius between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for the collision debris @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our algorithm is to obtain a realistic instantaneous spatial distribution of the collisional dust .",
    "this will depend upon the collisional environment of the planetesimals .",
    "below we describe the algorithm : + * step 1 : * determine the total mass crossing the orbit of each planetesimal , @xmath27 .",
    "the orbits of two planetesimals intersect under the condition @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the orbital period , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the phase of the orbit . + * step 2 : * use the total mass and number of orbit crossing planetesimals ( @xmath33 ) to calculate the average mass of a collider , @xmath34   + * step 3 : * find the number of collisions necessary to encounter one target mass worth of colliders , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass of the target body .",
    "+ * step 4 : * scale the mass of a full size distribution of debris , @xmath37 , by the number of target masses encountered per orbit , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the collisional timescale of the target , @xmath40 is the collisional cross - section of the target , @xmath41 is the target radius , @xmath42 is the radius of @xmath43 , @xmath44 the escape velocity from an object with a mass equal to the combined mass , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the velocity dispersion of the orbit crossing planetesimals , @xmath47 is the speed of the target , and @xmath48 is the number density of colliders .",
    "+ * step 5 : * scale the mass of debris produced from the total disruption of the target , @xmath37 , by @xmath49 and calculate the mass of a single dust pixel , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of dust units to be spread around the target s orbit ( in this work @xmath52 ) . + * step 6 : * spread the dust around the target orbit in @xmath53 such that each dust pixel is spaced equally in time .",
    "therefore , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the semi - major axis of the orbit , @xmath56 is the semi - minor axis of the orbit , and @xmath25 is the distance from the stellar focus to the dust pixel .",
    "the fixed  mass embedded planet simulations ( sim . 03 ) are qualitatively similar to the corresponding growing  planet simulations ( sim .",
    "49 ) in all major respects ( i.e. planetesimal , surface density , and dust distributions ) .",
    "however , the large impulse from the @xmath57 planet at the start of the simulations reduces the disk particle number drastically , giving poor collision statistics .",
    "therefore , only simulations with a growing planet ( sim .",
    "49 ) are discussed here .",
    "figure [ fig : e0_0_merge_surfd_evo ] shows an example of the temporal evolution of the planetesimal surface density ( in this case for sim .  4 ) .",
    "the structures in the surface density evolution are qualitatively similar in both the equivalent _ rubble _ simulation ( sim .  7 ) and",
    "the fixed ",
    "planet mass simulation ( sim .  0 ) .",
    "all of the e=0.0 simulations result in a clearly defined gap around the orbit of the planet and additional partial gaps at low  order mean motion resonances .",
    "in addition there is a horseshoe ring of planetesimals that orbit with the planet in 1:1 resonance ( visible from 330 yr ) .",
    "these obvious structures in the planetesimal disk become less clear with increasing planet eccentricity .",
    "the collisionally active zones of the planetesimal disk are highlighted in figure [ fig : e0_0_e0_2_merge_rub_eva ] .",
    "significant planetesimal growth is generally confined to the inner planetesimal disk with more modest growth in the outer disk and the 1:1 resonance . in the low eccentricity simulations regions of growth",
    "are stimulated by low ",
    "eccentricity pileups such as those at the 1:2 and 2:3 inner resonances .",
    "however , it is clear from the extended planetesimal disk simulation ( sim .  9 , fig .",
    "[ fig : e0_0_e0_2_merge_rub_eva]-*d * ) that planetesimal growth is enhanced out to at least the outer 2:1 resonance . unlike the smaller disk simulations ( sim .",
    "08 ) there are enough planetesimals at low eccentricity and larger semi - major axis to collisionally interact with the highly eccentric planetesimals that have been excited by the planet ( those planetesimals on eccentric spurs  sharp arc - like features ) . increasing dust production both interior and exterior to the planet orbit . in the high  eccentricity simulations ,",
    "dynamical stirring increases the collision rate over a broad range in semi - major axis as in figure .",
    "[ fig : e0_0_e0_2_merge_rub_eva]-*b*. all simulations show eccentric spurs which increase the velocities and probabilities of collisions and are the main mechanism by which planetary stirring enhances collisional dust production .",
    "figure [ fig : fixed_grow_rub_dust_glow_radmc2]-*a * shows the surface density in dust if dust mass is tied directly to the planetesimal mass as is assumed in debris disks @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fixed_grow_rub_dust_glow_radmc2]-*b * to * e * use our new method described in  [ sec : image_dust_distrib ] which should be more realistic . if we assume that these disks are disruptive and in a quasi - steady state of collisional grinding",
    "then the inner disk will dominate the dust surface density .",
    "however , the reason that the inner disk is so bright in figure [ fig : fixed_grow_rub_dust_glow_radmc2]-*a * is because the planetesimals at small semi - major axis are not significantly perturbed by the embedded planet and have grown to large masses . in the @xcite method each planetesimal represents an entire collisional cascade , which generates significant dust mass . in reality the inner region of simulations is dynamically quiet and produces only a small amount of collisional debris because most collisions result in accretion events not disruption events .",
    "thus , for the rest of this paper we will discuss only the instantaneously generated dust mass calculated with our algorithm in the context of young transitional objects .",
    "simulations with a circular embedded planet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fixed_grow_rub_dust_glow_radmc2]-*b * and * c * ) have a bright inner ring , dark gap with bright 1:1 resonance , and a bright outer ring . however , the simulations with an eccentric planet ( @xmath58 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fixed_grow_rub_dust_glow_radmc2]-*d * and * e * ) have less pronounced 1:1 resonances and an incomplete gap .",
    "the fixed  mass simulations 03 share these qualitative traits .",
    "the murky gap in the eccentric simulations is at odds with the predictions from fluid simulations that predict a cleared eccentric gap @xcite .",
    "however , the short time  scale of our simulations may be the cause of this discrepancy .",
    "flux density plots in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : fixed_grow_rub_dust_glow_radmc2 ] were created with radmc3d @xcite , a monte ",
    "carlo radiative transfer code , at a wavelength of @xmath59 .",
    "the total observed flux depends strongly on the dust mass , which in turn depends on the assumed disk mass .",
    "we do not make any attempt to predict flux but instead concentrate on the qualitative features expected in a disk that is initially optically thick .",
    "small dust was modelled as two dust species , amorphous carbon ( ac ) and silicates ( sil ) , both species having radii of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and relative abundances of 0.2 ( ac ) and 0.8 ( sil ) . larger dust from @xmath62 to @xmath63",
    "is modelled using simple mie scattering spheres with three size bins per decade .",
    "this range was chosen as dust of all sizes should be created in a collision .",
    "the smallest size is approximately defined by the dust blow  out radius , and the largest is when emission in the sub ",
    "mm is no longer significant .",
    "features highlighted in the surface density plots are still present . in addition pericentre glow is visible in figure [ fig : fixed_grow_rub_dust_glow_radmc2]-*h * and * i * along with an azimuthal asymmetry in the flux distribution of the inner disk .",
    "figure [ fig : beamsize ] shows an illustrative example of the observational outcomes of our work . assuming a dust mass of @xmath64 ( the mass of the debris produced in sim",
    ".  7 ) and the dust composition outlined above , the maximum signature is @xmath65200 mjy when observed face on at 10 parsecs .",
    "as this is derived from the surface density this depends upon : size  range of dust , extrapolation model from planetesimals to dust , and particle number",
    ". however , the disk gap would be visible up to a beam  size of @xmath650.5 au ( 0.05  ) and the asymmetry of the disk when e@xmath660.0 up to a beam  size of @xmath652 au ( 0.2  ) .",
    "in this work we present results from ten numerical simulations of collisional dust production from dynamical stirring by a young embedded planet . the simulations that we present use two different planetesimal collision models , _ perfect merging _ and _ rubble_. most simulations use a small 3au - wide planetesimal disk and @xmath1 planetesimals , but we have also completed one lower resolution large disk simulation with a 10.2 au - wide disk and @xmath67 planetesimals . a significant advance of this work is the use of a more realistic dust production model , increasing the accuracy of the spatial distribution of instantaneous collisionally produced dust and the resulting observables .    the series of simulations found that dust production is enhanced by the presence of a planetary companion .",
    "dynamical stirring from the planet perturbs some planetesimals onto highly eccentric orbits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e0_0_e0_2_merge_rub_eva ] ) which increases collisional activity from the inner 1:3 resonance to the outer 2:1 resonance producing two bright regions interior and exterior to the gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fixed_grow_rub_dust_glow_radmc2 ] ) .",
    "the eccentric simulations show that a clean gap is not opened in contrast to the fluid case @xcite , but the disk asymmetry can be easily observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beamsize ] ) .",
    "the next steps will be to test and improve this model in numerous ways , observe the effect of multiple planets , improve the treatment of dust dynamics , and take account of the the dust lifetime .    the algorithm in  [ sec : image_dust_distrib ] neglects the effects of gas and primordial dust upon the dust dynamics .",
    "this work addresses the extreme case of no gas , but as the density of gas in the inner regions of transitional and pre  transitional disks is not well constrained @xcite other scenarios should be investigated .",
    "the _ rubble _ model is computationally intensive in a collisionally active disk . in the future edacm @xcite will be used .",
    "edacm has the same fragmentation and debris tracking capabilities whilst using analytical expressions to determine outcomes , reducing computational load .",
    "finally , the exact magnitude and lifetime of the collisional dust can not be determined from these simulations .",
