    "i.e.  the vector fields are smooth and all the derivatives ( of degree @xmath8 ) are bounded  and @xmath9 denotes a finite dimensional brownian motion on the wiener space @xmath10 , and @xmath11 a compound poisson process with jump - rate @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the initial value @xmath14 appears as superscript in the notation @xmath15 of the solution process , i.e.  @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that @xmath17 is the generator of a @xmath18-semigroup denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the main reference for equations of the type   is the monograph of g.  da prato and j.  zabczyk  @xcite . in the ( general ) lvy case",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite , even though we do not need results of their strength in our case since all lvy processes under consideration are of finite type .",
    "due to the unboundedness of the operator @xmath17 several concepts of solutions to   arise .",
    "we refer for the precise definitions to the excellent monograph @xcite .",
    "the most direct analogue to the finite dimensional setting is the concept of a _",
    "strong solution _ , which is defined by @xmath20 i.e.  by the integrated version of equation  . besides the obvious integrability assumptions we need in particular that @xmath21 for all @xmath22 almost surely with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "more relevant is the concept of a _ mild solution _ , which is related to via variation of constants .",
    "indeed , a mild solution is a process @xmath15 satisfying @xmath24 given the obvious integrability assumptions . by it s formula , any strong solution is a mild solution , but not the other way round .",
    "note that mild solutions need not be semi - martingales , because there is no semi - martingale decomposition if the process evolves outside of @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , a stratonovich formulation of   is , in general , not possible for mild solutions .",
    "of course , neither strong nor mild solutions can usually be given explicitly , which makes numerical approximation necessary .",
    "we are interested in _ weak approximation _ of the solution in the sense that we want to approximate the value @xmath26 for a suitable class of test functions @xmath27 at initial values @xmath28 .",
    "it is well - known that the function @xmath29 solves the kolmogorov equation in the weak sense , see for instance @xcite in the diffusion case .",
    "let us assume for a moment that there are no jump - components : usually , infinite dimensional sdes are numerically solved by finite element or finite difference schemes , see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for hjm models of financial mathematics a finite difference scheme and a finite element scheme have been implemented in @xcite .",
    "this means that the original equation is projected onto some finite dimensional subspace @xmath30 and @xmath17 is approximated by some operator @xmath31 defined thereon .",
    "this procedure , which corresponds to a space discretization of the stochastic pde , is followed by a conversion of the stochastic differential equation on @xmath32 to a stochastic difference equation by discretizing in time , using an euler method or a related scheme .",
    "finally , the stochastic difference equation is solved by monte - carlo simulation , which may be interpreted as a discretization on the wiener space . for general information about approximation of finite dimensional sdes",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we want to tackle the problem in the reverse order : we want to do the discretization on the wiener space @xmath33 first , reducing the problem to a deterministic problem , i.e. , one replaces the @xmath34-dimensional brownian motion with finitely many trajectories of bounded variation chosen with well - defined probabilities such that certain moments ( of iterated stratonovich integrals ) match .",
    "the resulting deterministic problem can be solved by standard methods for the numerical treatment of deterministic pdes , e.g.  by standard finite element or finite difference methods .",
    "the benefit is that once the discretization on the wiener space has been done , we can use the well - established theory of the corresponding deterministic pde - problems , without any complications from stochasticity .",
    "our method of choice for discretization on @xmath33 is `` _ _ cubature on wiener space _ _ '' , developed by terry lyons and nicolas victoir in @xcite and by shigeo kusuoka in @xcite and @xcite , see also @xcite . in the spirit of these methods",
    "we shall obtain weak approximation schemes of any prescribed order of convergence .",
    "notice here that we discretize in the presence of the unbounded operator @xmath17 in the drift vector field .",
    "certainly our assumptions [ ass : dainfty ] seem very restrictive , but these assumptions are the appropriate analogues of the assumptions in finite dimension that the vector fields are bounded , @xmath35-bounded ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    before going into details ,",
    "let us motivate the use of cubature formulas in the present context .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the solution of  , formally rewritten in stratonovich form , if each `` @xmath37 '' is replaced by `` @xmath38 '' , i.e.   @xmath39 for a curve function @xmath40 of bounded variation .",
    "roughly speaking the idea of cubature on wiener space is to construct short - time asymptotics ( for some given degree of accuracy @xmath41 ) @xmath42 with some positive , time - independent weights @xmath43 satisfying @xmath44 and some @xmath34-dimensional paths @xmath45 of bounded variation .",
    "of course , the weights and paths are chosen in a specific way , which will be described later in more detail , and the asymptotics will only hold for some class of test functions @xmath46 . notice in particular that the cubature paths @xmath47 depend on the interval @xmath48 $ ]  they become rougher as @xmath49 approaches @xmath50 . the aforementioned procedure replaces the sde by @xmath51 deterministic , well - defined pdes , which have unique mild solutions .",
    "the iteration of the short - time asymptotics due to the markov property then yields a weak , high order approximation scheme .",
    "_ here also the main advantage of cubature methods in contrast to taylor methods gets visible_. the time - discretization in the realm of cubature methods always leads to reasonable expressions , namely to _ reasonable partial differential equations of type  _ .",
    "if we wanted to apply the usual discretization methods in time like the euler - maruyama method , we might run into problems .",
    "indeed , the naive euler scheme is well - suited for the differential formulation   of the problem , @xmath52 for @xmath53 , but it might immediately lead to some @xmath54 . even in the case of a well - defined strong solution , there is no reason why the discrete approximation should always stay in @xmath25 .",
    "hence the naive implementation of the euler - maruyama method does not work .",
    "only formulation   seems to be suitable for using an euler - like method . if one understands the semigroup @xmath55 well , one can approximate @xmath15 by expressing the integrals in   as riemannian sums , involving evaluations of @xmath56 , which yields a sort of strong euler method ( see for instance the very interesting book @xcite for strong convergence theorems in this direction ) .",
    "we do not discretize the integral in formulation  , but ( weakly ) approximate the brownian motion s paths by paths of bounded variation such that we obtain a weak approximations of @xmath15 .",
    "the presence of jumps does not lead to more complicated expressions , since the short time asymptotics of a jump - diffusion can be easily derived from a diffusion s short - time asymptotics by conditioning on the jumps .",
    "the arising picture is the following .",
    "discretizing the equation   means to allow a certain number of jumps between to consecutive points in the time grid . between two jumps",
    "we apply a diffusion cubature formula to express the short - time asymptotics .",
    "this yields as a corollary of the diffusion theory also the jump diffusion theory .",
    "[ rem : infinite - activity ] a direct application of the cubature on wiener space technique to jump diffusions driven by lvy processes of infinite activity is not possible .",
    "however , notice that any lvy process can be approximated by processes with finite activity in a weak sense , see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite , and therefore the solutions of the corresponding hilbert - space valued sdes converge weakly . in this sense",
    ", cubature methods can be use for jump diffusions driven by lvy processes of infinite activity , too .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : setting ] we describe the analytic setting for a stochastic taylor expansion to work .",
    "this is a delicate question since we deal with one unbounded vector field . in section [ sec : cubat - bound - oper ] and section [ sec : cubat - equat - mathc ]",
    "we work out the cubature method from the scratch and prove the relevant convergence results in the diffusion case . in section [ sec : jump - structure ] we allow for jumps and prove the associated short - time asymptotics which is relevant to set up a weak approximation scheme . in section [ sec : numerical - examples ] we apply our method to several examples to demonstrate the results .",
    "let @xmath57 be a filtered probability space with a filtration @xmath58 satisfying the usual conditions .",
    "let @xmath59 be a @xmath34-dimensional brownian motion and @xmath60 , @xmath61 be @xmath62 independent compound poisson processes given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes a poisson process with jump rate @xmath65 and @xmath66 is an i.i.d .",

    "let @xmath71 , the diffusion vector fields , and @xmath72 , the jump vector fields , be @xmath35-bounded on @xmath0 , that is , the vector fields are infinitely often differentiable with bounded partial derivatives of all proper orders @xmath53 .",
    "we consider the mild cdlg solution @xmath73 of a stochastic differential equation @xmath74 see @xcite for all necessary details on existence and uniqueness for the previous equation .",
    "notice furthermore the decomposition theorem in @xcite , which states that we do not need any further existence and uniqueness results in this case : in particular , we do not need to impose further ( contractivity ) conditions on @xmath17 as in  @xcite in the finite activity case .",
    "the previous conditions are slightly more than standard for existence and uniqueness of mild solutions , i.e.  in @xcite the authors need lipschitz conditions on the vector fields , whereas we assume them to be @xmath35-bounded . in order to formulate a stochastic taylor expansion we shall need one main assumption , which we formulate in the sequel .",
    "this assumption has already been successfully applied in several circumstances , e.g.  @xcite , @xcite or the recent @xcite .",
    "we apply the following notations for hilbert spaces @xmath75 , @xmath76 which we need in order to specify the main analytic condition for our considerations :    [ ass : dainfty ] we assume that @xmath71 , the diffusion vector fields , and @xmath77 , the jump vector fields , map @xmath78 and are @xmath35-bounded thereon for each @xmath79 , that is , the vector fields are infinitely often differentiable with bounded partial derivatives of all orders @xmath80 on the hilbert space @xmath81 for each @xmath82 .",
    "these assumptions are the appropriate analogues of the assumptions in finite dimension that the vector fields are bounded , @xmath35-bounded ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . in order to establish a true convergence rate",
    "one needs an additional cut - off argument , which is outlined in remark [ remark_ass : dainf ] .",
    "this can  like in the finite dimensional setting  certainly be improved .",

    "let @xmath0 be a separable hilbert space and @xmath70 the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup .",
    "we know that @xmath84 is a frchet space and an injective limit of the hilbert spaces @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "following the analysis as developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite were the analytic concepts have been originally developed ) , we can consider the vector field @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath88 is smooth in the sense explained in @xcite and has the property that its derivatives of order @xmath53 are bounded on @xmath89 , then @xmath90 is obviously a @xmath83-bounded vector field and additionally @xmath91 is a banach - map - vector field in the sense of @xcite .",
    "such vector fields constitute a class , where the above assumptions can be readily checked .",
    "we shall assume in this section that there are no jumps , i.e.  we consider @xmath92 in order to give an introduction to cubature on wiener space , we consider the problem for a bounded operator @xmath17 . in this case , there are virtually no differences to the finite dimensional setting , except the fact that the drift vector field does not need to be bounded by some constant on the whole hilbert space ( due to the presence of one linear operator in it ) .",
    "remember that in @xcite and @xcite and @xcite one deals with globally bounded vector fields .",
    "we shall circumvent this problem by a small refinement of the arguments .",
    "since mild and strong solutions coincide , we can always work with strong solutions , which are semi - martingales .",
    "consequently , we can rewrite   into its stratonovich form @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the stratonovich - corrected drift , i.e.   @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the frchet derivative of a function or vector field @xmath97 .",
    "this notation enables us to write @xmath98 where we use the convention that `` @xmath99 '' .",
    "the following notions form the core of cubature on wiener space .",
    "we only give a short description and refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for more details .",
