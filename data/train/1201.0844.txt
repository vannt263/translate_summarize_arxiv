    "it is known that dynamical properties of usual antiferromagnets with antiferromagnetic orders are well explained in terms of magnons in spin - wave theory @xcite . on the other hand , dynamical properties in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain",
    "are known to be characterized by quasiparticles ( qps ) called spinons @xcite in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "these qps are different in various aspects , such as quantum numbers , lineshapes in dynamical structure factors ( dsfs ) , and definitions .",
    "namely , the former is defined as a quantum fluctuation around classical spin configurations , and carries an integer magnetization , showing a @xmath3-functional lineshape in dsfs .",
    "in contrast , the latter is defined in the bethe - ansatz formulation @xcite , and carries a fractional quantum number , showing power - law behaviors in dsfs .    in this paper",
    ", we consider qps of the 1d heisenberg chain in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "recently , karbach and his coworkers have introduced qps called psinon and anti - psinon as a hole and a particle in the distributions of bethe quantum numbers @xcite in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these qps well explain dynamical properties of the heisenberg chain for dsfs @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5@xcite .",
    "however , the behaviors in @xmath0 have not been fully understood in terms of these qps .",
    "for example , numerical simulations have suggested that there is a mode at high energies @xcite which does not follow the behaviors predicted based on the bethe formalism @xcite .",
    "also , experimentally observed high - energy peaks @xcite have not been quantitatively explained by psinons and anti - psinons .",
    "this implies that we also need to consider other qps to explain whole dynamical properties of 1d chains especially for @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain in a magnetic field under the periodic boundary condition @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian is defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the spin-1/2 operator at site @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath11 is positive , reflecting the antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the length of the chain is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath13 in the thermodynamic limit has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we investigate dynamical properties using exact bethe - ansatz solutions . in the bethe ansatz @xcite",
    ", the wavefunction of an eigenstate is expressed in a plane - wave form as @xmath14 ,   \\label{eq : wf}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the site of the @xmath9-th down spin for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the number of down spins and permutations of @xmath19 , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are given as @xmath22 where rapidity @xmath23 is obtained from the bethe equation @xcite : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is a set of integers or half - odd integers , called bethe quantum numbers .",
    "the above formulation means that the wavefunction of an eigenstate is obtained , once @xmath25 is given .",
    "the distribution of @xmath25 is somewhat analogous to the momentum distribution of the spinless fermion model in a chain .",
    "namely , in the ground state in a magnetic field , @xmath26 s are densely distributed around zero like a fermi sea .",
    "excitations from the dense distribution can be obtained by creating holes inside it or particles outside it .",
    "the hole and the particle are called psinon and anti - psinon , and denoted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively @xcite .    here , we consider solutions with two complex rapidities : @xmath23 for @xmath29 are real , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 with real @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are numbers which become exponentially small in the @xmath35 limit .",
    "the pair of the complex rapidities is called a string of length two or a 2-string . for these solutions ,",
    "we introduce two sets of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "one is for the real rapidities ( @xmath23 for @xmath29 ) , and the other is for the string ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we denote them by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "solutions with a string of length three or a 3-string are similarly defined . for these complex - rapidity solutions ,",
    "the particle in the distribution of @xmath37 can be regarded as the qp for the 2- or 3-string . in this paper , we denote them as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we consider behaviors of dsfs defined by @xmath40 for @xmath41=@xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the ground state and an excited state with excitation energy @xmath47 and momentum @xmath48 in a magnetic field .",
    "we also define @xmath49@xmath50@xmath51+@xmath0+@xmath52/6 $ ] .",
    "we calculated dsfs using the bethe - ansatz solutions , following refs .",
    "we used real - rapidity solutions of up to 2@xmath272@xmath28 excitations . for @xmath5 and @xmath0",
    ", we took into account 2-string solutions of @xmath53 states as well . for @xmath0 , contributions of 3-string solutions of @xmath53 states were also included .",
    "figure  [ fig : skw ] ( a ) shows the results of dsfs in a magnetic field .",
    "we can identify each continuum in terms of the qps as shown in table [ tbl : qp ] .",
    "it should be noted that 2-string solutions also carry large spectral weights and form the high - energy continuum in @xmath0 @xcite . in the zero - field limit , this continuum asymptotically reduces to the dominant mode in zero field called the des cloizeaux - pearson mode @xcite , because the @xmath54 for the 2-string is locked at zero and the psinon in @xmath36 behaves like a spinon . on the other hand , near the saturation field ,",
    "the real rapidities vanish , and the mode of the 2-string reduces to that of bound states of two overturned spins from the fully polarized state known for ferromagnetic chains .",
    "we compare the present results with the experimental results on cucl@xmath12n(c@xmath2d@xmath2 ) ( cpc ) in ref .",
