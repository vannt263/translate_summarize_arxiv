    "fredrickson @xcite has considered bcp in contact with a surface having a uniform preferential adsorption to one of the two blocks . above the order - disorder transition ( odt ) , where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the critical point value of @xmath3 above which an ordered phase appears ) , he used mean - field theory and found that the order parameter ( being the concentration difference between the two blocks ) has decaying oscillations .",
    "he showed that the oscillation periodicity depends on @xmath3 , and tends to the bulk lamellar periodicity as @xmath10 . in the same @xmath11 limit",

    "the situation is even more complicated in thin films , where the distance between the two boundaries , associated with the film thickness , is comparable to the periodicity of modulations in the bulk , and the surface induced morphology can be of different symmetry than that of the bulk . for a system taken in one of its ordered phases ( below the odt ) ,",
    "the free energy has a local minimum when the spacing between the surfaces is an integer multiple of the bulk repeat period .",
    "the mean - field behavior of bcp close to surfaces and for bcp films was calculated @xcite using a method applicable in both the strong and weak segregation limits .",
    "it was found that confinement of lamellar phase bcp may lead to parallel layering , or in some cases even to a perpendicular arrangement of the lamellae .",
    "self - consistent field theory ( scf ) was used @xcite to study the stability of these parallel , perpendicular and mixed lamellar phases in thin films of bcp .",
    "the latter phase consists of parallel lamellae near one surface and perpendicular lamellae near the opposite surface , but it was found to be unstable for symmetric a - b ( @xmath13 ) diblock copolymers .",

    "however , in our linear theory this does not happen , and the copolymer response is proportional to the surface field @xmath82 . the case where @xmath83 is a non - zero constant and @xmath84 , corresponds to the special case of uniform interfacial interactions .",

    "the correlation length @xmath12 diverges for small composition oscillations because a linear theory is employed ; addition of the @xmath29 term in @xmath59 would give a finite value of @xmath12 .",
    "as a result of the assumed short - range surface interactions , the periodicity and decay length of @xmath70 depend only on properties of the bulk , and not on surface details .",
    "using the notation @xmath90 the real part of the form ( [ gq ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the phase of the @xmath0-mode modulation .",
    "it determines the value of the @xmath70 solution at the boundary , @xmath46 .",
    "the phase @xmath93 for the @xmath94 mode is found to satisfy the following relation @xmath95 and therefore is determined by the degree of segregation @xmath3 , but not by the pattern amplitude @xmath56 .",
    "a plot of @xmath92 as a function of @xmath0 for several values of @xmath3 is shown in fig .  2 ( a ) .",
    "far from the odt point and deep into the disordered phase , @xmath96 , we find that all @xmath0-modes have a phase angle @xmath97 . as the odt",
    "is approached , the @xmath34 mode retains its value but larger @xmath0-modes have a negative phase while smaller @xmath0-modes have a positive phase . at @xmath98",

    "the amplitude behavior is shown in fig .  2 ( b ) , for the same series of segregation values @xmath3 .",
    "as the odt is approached , the @xmath34 mode becomes critical first , with a diverging amplitude .",
    "an interesting limit occurs when @xmath103 , that is , the average surface interaction is zero ( no net adsorption ) .",
    "no lamellar ordering parallel to the surface is expected . indeed , the resulting checkerboard behavior is illustrated for a surface pattern chosen for simplicity to contain only one mode : @xmath104 .",
    "3 depicts alternating a - rich ( white ) and b - rich ( black ) regions . in ( a )",
    "the decay length @xmath12 is smaller than in ( b ) , because in the former case the surface periodicity is twice as large .",
    "the oscillatory behavior , characterized by @xmath105 , has a very long wavelength , diverging as @xmath106 close to the odt point .",
    "usually , if no special measures are taken @xcite , there is a net preference to one of the monomers : @xmath107 .",
    "the bcp morphology where the surface interactions were chosen to have both a non - zero average preference and undulatory character , namely @xmath108 , is shown in fig .",
    "4 . a smooth crossover from surface - induced ordering at small distance",
    "to the bulk disorder occurs .",
    "the parallel lamellae resulting from the @xmath83 term persist farther from the surface than the bulges resulting from the @xmath56 term , as @xmath109 decays slower than @xmath70 . for a given @xmath83 ,",
    "having a higher @xmath0-mode or reducing the modulation strength @xmath56 will enhance the lamellar features far from the surface .      until now the bcp melt was assumed to be bounded by one surface at @xmath46 . in this section",
    "we extend our analysis to a thin - film system confined between two parallel surfaces located at @xmath110 and @xmath111 , shown in fig .",
    "when the distance @xmath112 between the surfaces is comparable to the natural bulk periodicity , the two surfaces interact via the bcp and the resulting film morphology can be very different from that of the one - surface case ( sec .",
    "[ 1surface ] ) .",
    "however , the mathematical analysis is almost the same ; one only has to apply different boundary conditions on the bcp order parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the surfaces at @xmath49 are assumed to carry different surface fields of the form @xmath113 .",
    "only small modifications must be included to adjust the results of the previous section .",
    "the same ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) for @xmath114 is used .",
    "the functions @xmath70 that minimize the appropriate @xmath47-averaged free energy ( [ f ] ) obey @xmath115 with @xmath72 given by the same relation ( [ kq ] ) .",
    "however , unlike the semi - infinite bulk one - surface case ( [ gq ] ) , both signs of the @xmath116 vectors are used because the system is finite in the @xmath117-direction .",
    "in addition , repeating the procedure outlined for the one - surface case , gives the boundary conditions for @xmath70 : @xmath118 we consider now several specific surfaces . in the first @xmath119 is a constant , while @xmath120 is purely sinusoidal and average to zero , as depicted in fig .  6 .",
    "as expected , the b polymer ( in black ) is attracted to the upper surface , while the bottom surface exhibits modulated adsorption pattern .",
    "although lamellar features are seen near the top surface , the overall apparent phase in the sample can not be classified as such .",
    "the corresponding plots of the functions @xmath121 and @xmath122 are shown in fig .",
    "7 ( same parameters as in fig .",
    "6 ) . in general @xmath70",
    "is nonzero even at the @xmath110 surface , although the surface does not induce modulations by itself , @xmath123 .",
    "thus modulations propagate from one surface to the other by the copolymer melt .",
    "this is an interesting observation which may have relevance in applications .",
    "it relies on the relative small thickness of the bcp film .",
    "the situation as depicted in fig .",
    "6 represents a competition between two mechanisms .",
    "the modulated pattern at the bottom surface induces a laterally modulated pattern of the bcp , while the top surface uniform interaction induces a lamellar - like layering of the copolymers . as the modulated adsorption pattern strongly depends on the modulation wavenumber , so does the resulting morphology .",
    "this effect is shown explicitly in fig .  8 , where the top surface is uniform and the bottom is modulated , for a series of @xmath124 values .",
    "the transition from a locally perpendicular ( bottom patterned surface ) to a locally parallel orientation ( at the top uniform surface ) is seen in ( a ) , similar to the so - called t - junctions between grains of different orientations @xcite .",
    "similar behavior was found by the scf calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite .    figure .",
    "9 ( a ) shows the spatial dependence of the bcp order parameter when the two surfaces contain only one @xmath0-mode and are patterned _ in phase _ with each other ( symmetric arrangement ) , but with opposite signs , @xmath125 .",
    "the copolymer patterns create a perfect checkerboard arrangement and are related to each other at the surfaces by an interchange of monomers a@xmath126b .",
    "the surface pattern ( [ sigma ] ) contains only @xmath127 terms .",
    "a generalization that includes @xmath128 sinusoidally varying modes is straightforward . in this case",
    "the patterns at the surfaces can be out  of  phase with each other . figure .",
    "9 ( b ) shows such a morphology , for @xmath129 , @xmath130 , where there is a @xmath131 phase shift between the two surface fields . the perfect checkerboard arrangement of 9 ( a )",
    "is now distorted to accommodate this phase shift .",
    "so far we considered a melt in contact with a surface or confined between two surfaces of one dimensional symmetry . in our approximation , like in any linear response theory",
    ", there is no @xmath0-mode coupling proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "this fact allows us to go further and introduce a two - dimensional generalization of the surface pattern , which so far was taken to be independent on @xmath48 .",
    "the surface now is assumed to carry a chemical pattern @xmath133 which can be written as : @xmath134 the `` linear response '' function is then @xmath135 because @xmath2 and @xmath82 are real functions , @xmath136 and similarly for @xmath82 . using the above form it is possible to carry out the integration of the free energy in the @xmath137 plane . denoting @xmath138 as the average in the @xmath137 plane",
    ", it can be checked , for example , that @xmath139 defining @xmath140 and performing the free energy minimization with respect to @xmath141 , the functions @xmath142 obey the same master equation ( [ gov - gq ] ) that @xmath70 previously obeyed , with the only change that @xmath143 is replaced by @xmath144 . for a bcp in contact with a single surface ,",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions are : @xmath145 the solution for @xmath146 is analogous to ( [ gq ] ) , @xmath147 @xmath148 having found the response of the polymers to the surface modes @xmath149 , one is able to deduce the concentration profiles for any given two - dimensional surface pattern . in order to illustrate this",
    ", we take a system of chemical affinity in the shape of the letters `` bcp '' on the @xmath46 surface [ fig .",
    "10 ( a ) ] , and calculate the polymer concentration in the planes parallel and above it .",
    "all sizes are expressed in terms of @xmath150 , the lamellar fundamental periodicity .",
    "the shape of the letters continuously deforms as one moves away from the surface .",
    "contour plots corresponding to planes parallel to the @xmath137 surface and separated by a distance @xmath151 , for integer @xmath152 , are approximately given by an @xmath153 interchange of monomers .",
    "this is the characteristic distance at which the polymers flip .",
    "note that fig .",
    "10 ( c ) and ( e ) are approximately the inverse image ( `` negative '' ) of ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) .",
    "the original features are completely washed away as the distance @xmath117 from the surface is further increased . in our case for @xmath154 where the surface pattern size was roughly @xmath150 .",
    "figure 10 also illustrates circumstances where a certain surface pattern is transferred via the bulk bcp to another , distant surface .",
    "it may be important to know , for example , if the contrast of the distant image can be experimentally detected .",
    "this reduction of the contrast is clearly seen by comparing fig .",
    "10 ( b ) and ( f ) , and can easily be calculated from our expressions .",
    "the lamellar order created parallel to the edges of the letters in fig .",
    "10 ( b ) is the result of the undulatory nature of the block copolymers : order extending perpendicular to the surface induces order in the direction parallel to it .",
    "the copolymer melt can follow the surface pattern when its size is larger than the polymer length - scale @xmath150 .",
    "the effect of reducing the size of the surface structure is seen as a blurred morphology in fig .",
    "11 ( a ) , where the `` bcp '' pattern was chosen to have dimensions @xmath155 , compare to @xmath156 of fig .  10 ( b ) .",
    "the effect of raising the temperature ( further away from the odt ) is seen in fig .",
    "it is similar to fig .  10 ( b ) , only that the temperature is higher , @xmath157 , and the lamellar features along the edges of the letter are less prominent .",
    "again , using our order parameter expressions one can quantify the @xmath0-mode spectrum and contrast of the distant image , as a function of the original surface pattern @xmath133 , temperature and distance from the @xmath46 surface .",
    "in a thin film , creation of truly three dimensional , complex morphologies between the two surfaces can be achieved by using only one - dimensional surface patterns . as an example we choose a simple sinusoidal pattern on each of the @xmath49 surfaces , rotated 90 degrees with respect to one another : @xmath158 and @xmath159 . in fig .",
    "12(b ) the resulting morphology in the @xmath46 mid - plane is shown and is a superposition of the two surface patterns .",
    "because @xmath46 is a symmetric plane , the pattern has a square symmetry .",
    "more complex patterns can be created at different @xmath117 planes .    in sec .",
    "[ 1d ] we showed that the @xmath94 mode of the surface pattern is the slowest decaying mode , resulting in a lamellar layering parallel to the surface as @xmath160 , no matter what the surface pattern is .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .  13 , where in ( a ) we choose a simple one - dimensional structure in the shape of a stripe of width @xmath150 . inside the stripe of width @xmath150 , @xmath161 while outside it , the surface area is neutral , @xmath162 .",
    "thus , the b - polymer is preferentially adsorbed onto the stripe .",
    "the order parameter contour plot in the @xmath163 plane is shown in ( b ) .",
    "it can be seen that the `` surface disturbance '' is enclosed with alternating lamellae .",
    "the distorted lamellae close to the @xmath46 surface appear curved , and slowly fade away as the distance from the surface is increased .",
    "a different scenario is presented in fig .",
    "14 , where inside the stripe of thickness @xmath150 , @xmath164 as above , but outside the stripe the surface is not neutral : @xmath165 .",
    "we find that the adsorption on the surface is quite different than in fig .  13 .",
    "far from the stripe , the a - polymer is adsorbed onto the surface and induces stacking of the bcp in a direction parallel to the surface .",
    "close to the surface perturbation ( the stripe ) the behavior is altered as the lamellae are strongly deformed in order to optimize their local interaction with the surface stripe .",
    "we have employed a simple ginzburg - landau expansion of the bcp free energy to study analytically the confinement effects of block copolymers between two patterned surfaces as well as the interfacial behavior of a bcp close to a patterned surface .",
    "our approach consists of finding the governing equation for a presumably small perturbation to the bulk order parameter , by retaining second - order terms in the free energy .",
    "this approach can be justified in the vicinity of the critical point . above the odt it gives rise to a simple linear equation with fixed coefficients @xcite .",
    "a generalization to two - dimensional surface patterns is presented , where a complete spatial description of the polymer concentration is given in terms of an arbitrary surface pattern . however",
    ", this approach applies to systems below the odt as well , where a linearization is to be taken around an ordered phase @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the surface interactions are strictly local means that the length scales of the polymer morphology are determined by bulk properties .",
    "moreover , each of the surface @xmath0-modes in @xmath166 gives rise to a corresponding mode @xmath167 in the local polymer concentration @xmath51 .",
    "this `` response '' mode is characterized by a single wavevector @xmath66 .",
    "the wavevector @xmath66 is determined by @xmath3 and the surface wavenumber @xmath0 . in fig .  1 we show the dependence of @xmath66 on these parameters . the high @xmath0-modes of the surface pattern @xmath133 decay more rapidly than those of low @xmath0 . for high @xmath0-modes of characteristic length scale much smaller than the polymer chains",
    "@xmath150 , the bcp melt can not follow the surface modulations , and feels just the average of those modulations ( which is zero for @xmath168 ) .",
    "this dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath0 and @xmath3 is very similar to the results found by petera and muthukumar @xcite using a different free - energy functional .",
