    "faraday waves are generated when the free surface of a fluid layer is subjected to a periodic vertical acceleration @xcite .",
    "when the acceleration exceeds a threshold value , surface waves appear oscillating at half the forcing frequency .",
    "recently , faraday waves , which comes under the category of spontaneous pattern formation , a very general phenomenon studied in different fields of nonlinear science , were observed in a cigar shaped bec by periodically modulating the radial trap frequency @xcite .",
    "the radial modulation leads to a periodic modulation of the density of the cloud in time , which in turn leads to a periodic change in the non - linear interactions .",
    "this leads to the parametric excitation of longitudinal soundlike waves ( faraday waves ) in the direction of weak confinement .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that for a bec , faraday instability can be generated either by modulating the scattering length by feshbach resonance @xcite or by modulating the trap frequency in the tight confinement direction @xcite . in both the cases ,",
    "the dynamics are governed by a mathieu equation that is typical for parametrically driven systems .",
    "floquet analysis reveals that a series of resonances exists , consisting of a main resonance at half the driving frequency and higher resonance tongues at interger multiples of half the driving frequency .",
    "a theoretical analysis of faraday instability based on a mathieu - type analysis of the non - polynomial schrdinger equation was given recently @xcite .",
    "from the perspective of phonon number occupation , the faraday type modulation has been analyzed theoretically @xcite . in general",
    ", the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics of becs is attracting increasing interest in recent years , with a major focus on controlling structures like solitons by temporal modulation of the atomic scattering length @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a bec in a time dependent trap has been addressed earlier by some authors @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze faraday instability in a two - component cigar shaped bec .",
    "the two components could be for example @xmath0 atoms in two different hyperfine states in different external trapping potentials .",
    "a periodic modulation of the radial trap frequencies would give rise to faraday instability in both the components .",
    "the dynamics of this system is now governed by two coupled mathieu equations .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the natural frequencies of the two components then the parametric resonances will occur not only at @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is an integer ) but also at the combination frequencies ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the behaviour of this system would then be similar to spontaneous pattern formation in miscible and immiscible binary classical liquids @xcite .",
    "an important question is the stability of such faraday waves in binary mixtures because depending on the atom - atom interaction strengths @xmath7 ( intra species interactions ) and @xmath8 ( inter species interaction ) , binary mixtures can be phase separated ( @xmath9 ) or phase mixed ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear interaction can be conveniently manipulated by feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to analyze the influence of the interactions on the stability of the parametric excitations that are generated as a result of periodic modulation of the radial confinements of the two cigar shaped elongated components of the bec held in a magnetic trap .",
    "in contrast to binary liquids , the interactions in the present system are tunable and one can in the same experiment crossover from one state to the other .",
    "in particular , we show that a phase mixed state is more unstable towards parametric excitations than a phase separated state .    )",

    "starting from the lowest tongue , the resonances are @xmath11 and @xmath12 . clearly compared to figure 1 , nearby resonance tongues are overlapping and thereby the stable regions around the resonance tongues are reduced indicating that a lower value of the perturbation is sufficient to induce a faraday instability in the phase mixed state as compared to a phase segregated state . ]",
    "we consider a situation in which we have a two component bec ( bosonic atoms of the same isotope but having different internal spin states , eg .",
    "@xmath0 atoms in hyperfine states @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",

    ", we will discuss the role of damping on the stability chart and include it while studying the spatio - temporal dynamics of the bec .    when the condition @xmath33 is satisfied , the condensates are phase segregated . in the opposite limit i.e @xmath34 , the condensates are in a mixed state .",
    "our study covers the @xmath35 case of a cigar shaped bec extended along the @xmath36 direction , @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 is assumed which means that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the frequencies of the trap for the @xmath19 component along the weak and tight confinement directions , respectively .",

    "the boundary curves for the instability regions must therefore emerge from these frequencies .",
    "the wavenumbers @xmath101 corresponding to the resonance tongues near the natural frequencies and their subharmonics is @xmath102 . in order to find the stability diagrams for the two coupled mathieu equations , we employ the method indicated in @xcite .",
    "the method involves infinite determinants which are truncated and then the eigenvalues are found using mathematica , together with a condition on the characteristic exponent for the solutions on the boundary curves .",

    "the shaded regions are the regions of instability .",
    "clearly one notices that the two sets of resonance tongues , namely @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the phase separated case are more widely spaced with larger stability region in between the tongues than the phase mixed case .",
    "the stable regions between the resonance tongues for the phase separated mixture , extends as far as upto @xmath107 while those for the phase mixed case extends only upto @xmath62 .",
    "if the detuning of the driving frequency is of the same order for two adjacent modes then these modes can enter in competition .",
    "the competition between nearly degenerate modes has been shown to lead to chaotic behaviour in fluids @xcite .",
    "since the resonance tongues are more closely spaced in the phase mixed state , the mode competition will be stronger for this case .",
    "now , we study the time and space evolution of the deviation from the initial density @xmath108 by including phenomenologically a damping term proportional to @xmath109 in eqns .",

    "the parameters are @xmath113 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the periodicity of faraday patterns generated is always more for the condensate with lower natural frequency .",
    "we found that this observation is also true for the phase separated case .",
    "the influence of interactions on the periodicity of pattern formation is clear from the expression @xmath102 . tuning the interactions ,",
    "controls the @xmath114 and hence the periodicity .",
    "also noticed is the fact that onset of pattern formation is not immediate but takes a certain time due to damping .",
    "the fact that the phase mixed state is relatively more unstable compared to the phase segregated state was also revealed by the spatio - temporal dynamics ( figures not shown ) .",
    "we found that for a given driving @xmath99 and perturbation @xmath115 , the growth rate of the perturbations in the phase mixed state was much higher than that in the phase separated state . for long enough times in the presence of a continuous modulation",
    ", the excitations will grow and eventually the condensates will be destroyed .",
    "this contrasts with the everlasting periodic revivals of the spatial modulations in one component 1d case @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous pattern formation for combinations frequencies is much more complex and simple analytical formulations can not be done and would require a full numerical simulation of the coupled equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the dynamics of faraday instability in a two component elongated cigar shaped bec is described by two coupled mathieu equations .",
    "the dynamics depend on the two body intra and inter species interactions .",
    "in contrast to the single component case , we found that parametric resonances can occur not only at integral multiples of half the natural frequencies of the two components but also at integral multiples of half the combination frequencies .",
    "the stability chart in the @xmath116 plane reveals that the a phase separated binary mixture is more stable towards pattern formation than the phase mixed mixture .",
    "this was confirmed by the spatio - temporal dynamics of the bec where we found that the initial perturbation grows in a phase mixed state more rapidly than in the phase segregated case .",
