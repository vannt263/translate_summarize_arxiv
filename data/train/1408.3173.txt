    "finding new collective electronic states in materials is one of the fundamental goals of condensed matter physics .",
    "while the traditional approach has been to search for such phases within naturally occurring compounds , in recent years the focus has shifted to _",
    "@xcite : artificial materials formed by interleaving two or more structurally and chemically dissimilar materials . of particular interest is the spatial region at the _ interface _ where dissimilar materials meet .",
    "new states may emerge here because the environment near an interface is different from that occurring in bulk ( thermodynamically stable ) materials .",
    "advances in the _ angstrom - scale _ layer - by - layer synthesis of multi - element compounds for _ materials - by - design _ have taken the approach to a new level of power and sophistication : it enables the atomic - scale combination of materials with different properties , granting access to a new terrain in which unusual states of matter may arise @xcite .",
    "heterostructures formed from transition metal oxides ( tmo ) are a particularly appealing hunting ground for new physics . in these materials the transition metal ( @xmath0 ) ion has an open @xmath1-shell electronic configuration with spin , orbital , and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "electrons in these partially filled @xmath1-shells are _ correlated _ : the motion of one electron depends explicitly and non - trivially on the behavior of all of the others giving rise to interesting many - body phenomena @xcite .",
    "the resulting magnetic , superconducting , and multiferroic phases are of great scientific interest and are potentially capable of providing innovative energy , security , electronics and medical technology platforms . the heterostructure geometry @xcite enables otherwise unattainable changes in atomic structure and chemical bonding , leading to new modalities for control and optimization of known states and potentially leading to new ones .",
    "over the past decade , one particular class of heterostructures , based on the interface between lanthanum aluminate ( laalo@xmath2 ; lao for short ) and strontium titanate ( srtio@xmath2 ; sto for short ) , has been the subject of very extensive study . in this colloquium",
    "we choose not to discuss the lao / sto interface or its variants , selecting our examples instead from vanadate , manganite , cuprate and nickelate - based systems for two reasons .",
    "first , the lao / sto system and its variants have been extensively reviewed in other venues , see for example .",
    "second , and more importantly , the lao / sto system involves doping nominally insulating sto with maximum sheet carrier densities of fewer than 0.5 electrons ( @xmath3 ) per in - plane unit cell , and the charge density is typically spread over several unit cells in the direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "the volume carrier densities are therefore typically low , so that the situation is more closely related to a doped semiconductor than to the correlated electron materials on which we wish to focus here .",
    "nonetheless some of the scientific excitement has focused on superconductivity @xcite ( exhibited also when bulk sto is lightly doped by conventional dopants ) and anderson localization metal - insulator transitions @xcite .",
    "reports or theoretical suggestions of other correlation phenomena in this system including charge ordering @xcite and magnetism @xcite have also appeared ; we return to the issue in section iv and in the conclusions .",
    "this colloquium illustrates the essential features that make tmo - based heterostructures an appealing discovery platform for emergent properties .",
    "the guiding principle is that strong electronic correlations in combination with the access to new symmetries and electronic band structures provided by oxide interfaces can activate new electronic properties formerly `` hidden '' in bulk compounds .",
    "we illustrate this principle with a few selected examples , showing how charge redistributes , magnetism and orbital polarization arises and ferroelectric order emerges from heterostructures comprised of oxide components with nominally contradictory behavior .",
    "for example , interfaces may be metallic , magnetic , or ferroelectric even though in bulk form the constituent materials are insulating , non - magnetic , or simple dielectrics .",
    "we conclude by articulating open challenges and opportunities in the field , in particular , how to translate the new understanding of when emergent phases arise into control of novel behavior by design at oxide interfaces , and the manipulation of these states by suitable mechanical , electrical or optical boundary conditions and excitations .",
    "the formation of a coherent perovskite oxide heterointerface , as shown in , provides a remarkable correlated electron `` playground . ''",
    "it brings different transition metal cations with their localized @xmath1 electron physics and interacting charge , spin and lattice degrees of freedom into intimate contact in a tunable crystalline environment .",
    "the key structural features of transition metal oxides relate to the coordination geometry of the metal ions and the metal - oxygen - metal bond angles .",
    "these determine magnetic exchange interactions  @xcite and electronic bandwidths  @xcite , thereby controlling the electronic and magnetic ground states .",
    "structural and electronic changes across an interface can act to stabilize previously unanticipated phases of matter @xcite .",
    "consider for example a multilayer heterostructure comprised of alternating blocks of the metallic ferromagnet la@xmath4ca@xmath5mno@xmath2 ( lcmo ) , and the high - temperature cuprate superconductor yba@xmath6cu@xmath2o@xmath7 ( ybco ) sketched in .",
    "the interface brings several crucial structural effects .",
    "the first is a coordination mismatch .",
    "lcmo is a three - dimensional perovskite ( @xmath8o@xmath2 stoichiometry ) with corner - connected mno@xmath9 octahedra that may be described by interleaving alternating ( la , ca)o and mno@xmath6 layers along [ 001 ] .",
    "in contrast , ybco is a two - dimensional oxide with four- and five - fold coordinated cu cations .",
    "the layered cuprate structure may be considered as a derivative of perovskite , which partly facilitates coherent growth of the heterostructure .",
    "but unlike lcmo , ybco displays an ordered network of oxygen vacancies accommodated by the valence preferences of cu : one oxygen atom is removed from every third ( 001 ) yo plane to produce the square pyramidal cuo@xmath10 coordination , then on every third cuo@xmath6 layer , vacancies order along [ 100 ] , producing the square planar cuo@xmath11 coordination .",
    "thus a `` coordination mismatch '' arising from the change from the 6-fold coordination of the mn to the lower coordination of the cu ( , lower left ) occurs at the interface . as a result ,",
    "a set of cuo chains ( @xmath12 charge reservoir ) is missing from the interfacial ybco unit cell to maintain a prerovskite - like sequence ... mno@xmath6bao  cuo@xmath6 ... across the junction  @xcite .",
    "coherent epitaxial growth also produces an intrinsic strain mismatch arising from the different equilibrium lattice constants ( , center ) .",
    "the atomic structure at the heterointerface responds to alleviate the strain mismatch through relaxation of the interatomic distances and internal atomic degrees of freedom ( for example , rotations or size deformations to the transition metal oxygen polyhedra ) in the constituents along the superlattice repeat direction .",
    "these new atomic arrangements directly alter the electronic structure . away from the interface it is characterized by carriers in the @xmath1-manifold with orbital symmetries @xmath13 ( ybco ) and @xmath14 for lcmo ( , upper left ) , but near the interface the @xmath15 become occupied in the ybco and acquire more @xmath16 character in the lcmo .",
    "in addition to the structural effects , an electronic mismatch occurs .",
    "the ferromagnetism in lcmo relies on the cooperative _ parallel _ alignment of spins from the narrow correlated electronic bands ; singlet cooper pair formation in ybco , in contrast , relies on _ paired _ spins with antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "these antagonistic spin interactions ( frustration ) have been invoked to explain changes in the interfacial magnetization and superconductivity , @xmath17 giant magnetoresistance , the appearance of uncompensated magnetic moment on cu in cuo@xmath6 plane , and large modulation of ferromagnetic magnetization profile across the heterojunction  @xcite    the different valence configurations of the cations in the constituent materials of the heterostructure also induce changes in charge density and chemical bonding . in the system shown in ( lower right panel ) a charge of @xmath180.2@xmath3 per cu ion",
    "is transferred from mn to cu ions across the interface @xcite .",
    "the charge transfer at other oxide interfaces has also been found to exhibit a peculiar asymmetric electronic `` roughness '' intertwined with an asymmetric interface stacking sequence or an asymmetric chemical roughness @xcite .",
    "the effects from different stacking sequences and electronic roughness remain to be resolved . to summarize , the following degrees of freedom are highly tunable at an oxide interface and",
    "may be exploited in uncovering new phases :    * epitaxial strain mismatch owing to differences in equilibrium lattice parameters * atomic coordination frustration and cation site preferences * ordered spin and orbital states * charge flow across the interface ( layer dipole discontinuities ) * chemical frustration and interlayer mixing    the following examples detail how these considerations are made , and the exciting new phases born from the interplay of the correlated electronic and atomic structure across oxide interfaces .",
    "understanding and controlling the distribution of charge carriers at the interface between dissimilar semiconductors is one of the pivotal developments of modern microelectronics @xcite important both for devices and as a crucial platform for discovery of remarkable physical phenomena including integer and fractionally quantized hall effects as well as spin - hall and other spintronic phenomena . in conventional semiconductor heterojunctions the basic physics",
    "is driven by the difference in work - function , which causes charge transfer across the boundary to equalize chemical potentials .",
    "the work - function difference may be manipulated by a process known as @xmath19-doping  @xcite , in which a layer of ions is implanted in a plane at some distance from the interface .",
    "an additional advantage of @xmath19-doping is that the placement of the dopants at some distance from the interface minimizes the effects of randomness in the dopant positions .",
    "@xmath19-doping is now widely used to produce two dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) confined to the proximity to the interface ( @xmath17 gaas / algaas ) .",
    "the interest in using tmo to explore similar physics was motivated by two observations @xcite : ( @xmath20 ) in oxides , the accessible carrier density is expected to be orders of magnitude higher than that of semiconductors ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) , and ( @xmath23 ) the thomas - fermi screening length is expected to be much shorter , so the charges may be confined to within @xmath241 - 2 nm of the interface , a factor of @xmath25 shorter than the @xmath1810 nm length characteristic of semiconductor junctions .",
    "however , the current intense effort in material synthesis , theory , and device fabrication of oxide interfaces is motivated mainly by the known sensitivity of the correlated electron properties of transition metal oxides to the @xmath1-band filling  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of an interface - based method of carrier doping has revived the idea of tailoring the materials electronic properties and creating novel quantum states not easily attainable in the bulk counterparts . the basic idea ( analogous to that motivating @xmath19-doping )",
    "is to explore electronic and magnetic phases without the hindering effects of chemical disorder inherent in the conventional solid state chemistry methods of changing carrier concentration .    during the past several years",
    ", extensive experimentation has established that perovskite - based heterostructures are particularly susceptible to interlayer charge redistribution derived from the incompatibilities illustrated in making them ideal candidates to explore such possibilities  @xcite .      to illustrate the inherent interest of charge reconstruction on interfacial states , we discuss as one of many possible examples the recent progress on cuprate / manganite heterointerfaces .",
    "macroscopically it has been established that the introduction of a ferromagnetic ( la , ca)mno@xmath27 manganite layer into the heterostructure with an optimally doped ybco cuprate triggers a _ suppression _ of the superconducting transition temperature accompanied by a reduced ferromagnetic curie temperature  @xcite . in a recent set of experiments ( ) ,",
    "@xmath28-edge polarized resonant x - ray absorption spectra taken at the mn and cu edges reveal the presence of a chemical shift implying a flow of electronic charge across the interface of about @xmath180.2@xmath3 per cu atom @xcite .",
    "the depleted electrons from mno@xmath29 layer are directly transferred to the cuo@xmath29 planes , unbalancing the charge distribution between the atomic cuo@xmath29 layers and the cuo chain charge reservoir block .",
    "the average mn valence also increases from the as - grown value ( mn@xmath30 ) to around 3.5 , indicative of covalent bond formation across the mn ",
    "o  cu interface .",
    "the charge transfer across the interface from the mn to cu ions induces a major reconstruction of the @xmath1-orbital occupancies and frontier orbital symmetries in the interfacial cuo@xmath29 layers @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cu @xmath31 orbital , which is fully occupied and electronically inactive in the bulk cuprates becomes active at the interface ( b ) . at the same time charge transfer",
    "is observed in the presence of enhanced covalent chemical bonding across the interface , the cu cations from the nominally antiferromagnetic cuo@xmath29 plane acquire an uncompensated magnetic moment ( c ) , attributed to spin canting of the local moments on the interfacial cu cations .",
    "/@xmath32 spectra averaged across the two identically terminated heterointerfaces reveals that the electronic transition is more abrupt for the bottom interface ( right arrow ) than the top , broader , interface ( left arrow ) .",
    "the red dots represent the voltage of the minimum in the density of states . ]    initial studies of the interplay between the ferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters used synchrotron based x - ray and neutron reflectivity experiments .",
    "however these tools were unable to clearly resolve the length scale of interactions at the boundary between the two phases .",
    "very recently , the issue has been addressed by use of cross - sectional scanning tunneling microscopy ( xstm ) together with atomic - resolution electron microscopy ( eels / stem ) .",
    "these methods enable direct observation of the charge distribution and the corresponding spatial scale for the buried interface @xcite .",
    "shows the spatially resolved @xmath33/@xmath32 spectra , which provided the first direct evidence that the length scale for charge transfer between ybco and lcmo has an upper limit of < 1 nm , and that the spatial broadening of the electronic transition is commensurate with the rougher interface .",
    "this result sets a fundamental upper limit on the charge - transfer length scale in the ybco / lcmo system , ruling out a class of theories based on long - range proximity effects  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the established x - ray and neutron based probes , this powerful characterization technique provides a useful tool to achieve a microscopic direct space understanding of the electronic structure across correlated oxide interfaces .",
    "the complex behavior occurring at the lcmo / ybco interface highlights the need to develop a clear language and set of concepts to describe interface electronic physics in correlated oxides .",
    "the inherently many - body nature of the correlated interface raises fundamental questions , in particular of the applicability of the ideas , formulae , and language devised for semiconductor interfaces where a single - particle description works well",
    ". pioneering work of oka and nagaosa @xcite showed via density matrix renormalization group calculations of a one dimensional model system ( in essence the one dimensional hubbard model with a spatially varying interaction parameter and band bottom ) that the standard concepts of band bending and interface dipole apply , albeit with some modifications , as long as the conduction and valence bands are replaced by lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "a growing body of literature builds on this work , using the concepts of band bending , schottky barriers , and depletion layer creation borrowed from semiconductor physics @xcite , as well as more involved approaches , which unite poisson - schrdinger electrostatics with mott - hubbard physics @xcite .",
    "correlation physics is shown to lead to _ quantitative _ changes in the spatial confinement of carriers near interfaces @xcite , including the possible formation of extended depletion regions of zero compressibility ( so - called ` mott plateaus')@xcite .",
    "other theoretically proposed possibilities _",
    "unattainable with semiconductor junctions _",
    ", include a spontaneously emerging quantum - well structure when an electron - doped mott - hubbard insulator is coupled to a normal metal with a large work - function .",
    "following the same line of reasoning , in a @xmath34-@xmath35 junction between two correlated insulators the local mott gap collapses giving rise to a 2deg  @xcite .    with few exceptions @xcite",
    ", current experimental attention has focussed on interfaces such as that between the two band insulators laalo@xmath2 and srtio@xmath2 . in most of these situations the carriers",
    "are introduced via the polar catastrophe mechanism @xcite ; the maximum sheet carrier density is @xmath36 per in - plane unit cell and this carrier density is typically distributed @xcite over several unit cells away from the interface , leading in general to volume carrier densities far below the mott value of one per unit cell .",
    "density functional plus hubbard @xmath37 calculations @xcite indicate that a charge ordered phase in which the entire polar catastrophe charge density is in the first interface layer may be possible , but these suggestions have not yet been confirmed by experiment or beyond - dft methods .",
    "one very interesting potential exception is the work of on gdtio@xmath2/srtio@xmath2 heterostructures , where a nontrivial insulating phase was observed when two layers of srtio@xmath2 were sandwiched between thick sheets of gdtio@xmath2 .",
    "it has been explained by chen , lee and balents in terms of a novel ` mott dimer ' phase @xcite , where the carrier density is far below the one electron per transition metal ion value needed for mott physics ; nonetheless many theoretical predictions suggest alternative avenues for emergent properties to arise and warrant experimental investigation .",
    "additional issues beyond conceptual approaches to interface control arise .",
    "the length scales in correlated oxides are typically very short , so the details of the interface may be more important than in conventional semiconductors.a local picture is needed , which is able to address the formation of chemical bonds across the junction , differing electronegativities of transition metal ions , changes in both crystal field energies and madelung potentials , and polarity effects @xcite .",
    "a further complication is that while many correlated oxides are reasonably well described by the mott - hubbard picture on which the above - cited works are based , some important functional tmo are _ charge - transfer _ compounds  @xcite .",
    "the role of the lower hubbard band in these materials is usurped by the ligand states ( typically oxygen @xmath38 ) , thus implying a very different physical character for the doped holes ( mainly in oxygen levels ) and doped electrons ( mainly in transition metal @xmath1-levels ) . as a result",
    ", the alignment of the oxygen levels across the interface becomes crucial .    for all of the materials discussed in this paper , theoretical treatments which go beyond the simple hubbard model , including chemically realistic structures and energetics on the same footing as correlation effects ,",
    "are needed , as are experimental investigations of systems with higher electron densities and complete control over cation and oxygen stoichiometry .",
    "long range magnetic order in transition metal oxides usually arises from a combination of local moment formation on the transition metal site and inter - site coupling via the oxygen sublattice .",
    "heterostructures offer an opportunity to generate new magnetic states by manipulating both the moment formation and the nature of the inter - site coupling . as examples",
    ", we note that the paramagnet lacoo@xmath2 can be converted to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) material by tensile epitaxial strain , which changes the material from a low - spin to a high - spin state @xcite . on the other hand , bulk antiferromagnetic ( afm ) eutio@xmath2 can be converted to a ferromagnetic insulator under modest tensile strains @xcite .",
    "another notable example is the comprehensive study by , which examined three - component srruo@xmath2/manganite / srruo@xmath2 heterostructures .",
    "these authors found strong compressive strain causes relative fm alignment of magnetization in the heterostructure layers , while tensile or weak compressive strain favors afm alignment of neighboring layers .",
    "this sort of control over local magnetization in thin film geometries is of potential utility for oxide electronics and spintronic applications , including magnetic memory and sensing @xcite .",
    "for example , electromechanical coupling via a piezoelectric material can be used to control the orientation and strength of the magnetization by tuning the lattice parameters of the heterostructure through an applied electric field @xcite . here , we focus on going beyond strain control to make use of the broken symmetry at the interface between two dissimilar materials to generate unique spatially structured magnetic states",
    ".      one approach to manipulating magnetism involves interfacial charge transfer in heterostructures created from an antiferromagnetic _ insulator _ and a paramagnetic _ metal _ @xcite .",
    "the choice of materials in this case was determined by two key factors : first , creating moments from a material without any propensity to moment formation , @xmath12 , zero moments , is difficult .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to begin then by choosing a system with a large local moment such as camno@xmath2 with @xmath39/mn , which in bulk is a g - type ( conventional two - sublattice nel ) antiferromagnet .",
    "however , modest electron doping of this material leads to strong ferromagnetic ( fm ) correlations @xcite . in a quantum - well heterostructure",
    "in which a paramagnetic metal ( in this case caruo@xmath2 ) is confined between two thick layers of camno@xmath2 one may expect that charge transfer from the metal to insulating camno@xmath2 will lead to interfacial doping and thus ferromagnetism .",
    "theoretical studies substantiate this argument and find that a charge of approximately @xmath40e per interface unit cell leaks across the interface and is confined within @xmath181 unit cell at the caruo@xmath2/camno@xmath2 interface @xcite .",
    "although the magnitude of the charge leakage is small , it has a significant impact on the antiferromagnetic order in the camno@xmath2 , providing a mechanism for spin canting which yields large ferromagnetic moments at the interface @xcite . to validate this concept a study of the spatial distribution of the magnetism",
    "was carried out using x - ray resonant magnetic scattering ( xrms ) at the mn @xmath28-edge @xcite .",
    "shows the large xrms signal , and that it deviates from anticipated bulk g - type afm state , which shows no ferromagnetic component to the magnetic moment under identical strain conditions indicating that the ferromagnetism emerges from the interface @xcite . by fitting this signal as a function of incident angle ,",
    "the extent of the magnetic polarization away from the interface was found to extend over several unit cells in contrast to the length of one unit cell predicted by theory @xcite .",
    "the observed longer length scale of the magnetization profile discrepancy may be due to magnetic polarons , which are known to exist in lightly - doped camno@xmath2 @xcite , but such interfacial polarons have not explicitly investigated theoretically .",
    "octahedra of camno@xmath2 at the interface of the quantum - well structure with metallic caruo@xmath2 .",
    "the canting arises from electron transfer owing to the ohmic contact .",

    "[ fig : crocmo ] ]      strain and layer sequencing can offer additional handles to manipulate the interfacial magnetic state in the caruo@xmath2/camno@xmath2 system @xcite .",
    "the link between the metallic layer and magnetism is best illustrated by studying superlattices where the metallic layer undergoes a metal - to - insulator transition when the dimensionality is reduced in the ultra - thin layer , and correspondingly the magnetism disappears @xcite .",
    "one can use this understanding and exploit it to design new functional materials and there are many possibilities that exist within the perovskite familiy which can be combined to seek new types of magnetic states @xcite .",
    "for example , many antiferromagnets have ordering temperatures well - above room temperature , so one could extend this concept to create interfacial insulating _",
    "_ ferri__magnets that operate at high temperature @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to make use of the spatially localized magnetic state in proximity to a metallic layer to create a spin - polarized 2deg @xcite .",
    "more broadly , one could create heterostructures with two magnetic materials , and use the competition towards different collectively ordered magnetic states in addition to structural incompatibilities to generate a plethora of interesting and potentially spatially varying magnetic phases .",
    "these are but a few of the magnetic possibilities which remain to be uncovered at oxide heterointerfaces , chosen to highlight the large phase space still available for exploration and the opportunities available to connect with materials theory in the rational search for new magnetic systems .",
    "the orbital configuration , @xmath12 , the distribution of the @xmath1-electrons over the available crystal field levels , plays an important role in the formation of strongly correlated ground states in transition metal oxides @xcite . in general ,",
    "orbital configurations are closely linked to structure and may therefore be manipulated at interfaces . here",
    "we discuss these issues specifically for the orthonickelate perovskites @xmath41nio@xmath2 , where @xmath41 is a trivalent cation from the lanthanide series , but the ideas can be extended to other @xmath8o@xmath2 systems .    the original and decade later renewed interest in nickelates arose from the possibility of generating a cuprate - like electronic and orbital configuration in a copper - free system @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that in bulk @xmath41nio@xmath2 the ni is octahedrally coordinated , with only small deviations from cubic ( @xmath42 ) symmetry .",
    "further , formal valence considerations indicate that the nominally ni@xmath43 cation is in the low - spin @xmath44 configuration , with the @xmath45 states ( @xmath46 ) filled and one electron in the two - fold degenerate @xmath47-symmetry ( @xmath48 ) ni @xmath1-levels .",
    "low - spin @xmath44 is a first - order jahn - teller configuration , with a susceptibility to bond distortions which break the cubic point symmetry and are enhanced by correlation effects .",
    "it was thus expected that modest perturbations would split the @xmath47 levels , leaving an effective one - band configuration where the electron is fully confined to a single orbital .",
    "the degree to which an electron occupies two different @xmath49 and @xmath50 orbitals can be quantified as an _",
    "orbital polarization _",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the occupancies of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 states @xcite , with orbital quantum number @xmath56 and magnetic quantum number @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "for the rare - earth nickelates , the relevant orbital polarization arises from the @xmath58 and @xmath59 occupancies , and a fully polarized state @xmath60 would be indicative of a single band electronic structure .",
    "something akin to this effect occurs in many members of the `` colossal '' magnetoresistance manganites , where the basic configuration is a high - spin @xmath61 configuration and similarly a jahn - teller ion that can be manipulated with strain @xcite .",
    "hubbard - model calculations further indicated that the single - band physics was very likely to appear @xcite ; however , more realistic _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations indicate that the actual electronic configuration for ni is in the high - spin @xmath62 state with a hole on the oxygen ( @xmath63 ) @xcite . since the high - spin @xmath62 configuration has one electron in each of the two @xmath47 orbitals , it is significantly less susceptible to undergoing jahn - teller distortions , suggesting that it would be more difficult than initially expected to achieve the desired degree of orbital polarization , even in the correlated case @xcite .",
    "studies of the dependence of orbital polarization on the different flavors of structural symmetry - breaking @xcite is thus of great experimental interest and is a stringent test of the theory .",
    "advances in high - quality growth of nickelates over the past few years mean that we are now in a position to test these predictions @xcite .",
    "the basic experimental approach is to use a combination of quantum confinement , achieved by fabricating ultra - thin layers of tmo sandwiched between layers of wide - gap insulators , and epitaxial strain , obtained by varying the substrate material , to break the octahedral symmetry .",
    "advanced x - ray techniques are then used to estimate the resulting changes in orbital occupancies .",
    "however , _ ab - initio _ calculations based on density functional theory indicate that the contribution of strain to octahedral symmetry breaking is not completely intuitive ( see and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , a considerable degree of compression or tension can be accommodated by octahedral rotations , without necessarily changing the local point symmetry significantly since the nio@xmath9 units are highly flexible @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum confinement may be affected by the chemistry of the insulating layer , with different degrees of polarization found for different choices of wide - gap insulator @xcite .    at present , the experimental results are not completely consistent with each other or with theory .",
    "for example , examination of the ni @xmath64 edge indicated an @xmath65 orbital polarization for a single unit - cell of lanio@xmath2 subject to tensile strain @xcite and no orbital polarization for compressive strain .",
    "other measurements employing an orbital reflectometry technique on four unit cell films also observed a similar non - zero interfacial polarization for tensile strain @xcite .",
    "recent studies have indicated it is possible to increase the orbital polarization up to @xmath66 through judicious optimization of high tensile strain states and alternative spacer materials @xcite ; the latter had been shown theoretically to play a considerable role in obtaining the targeted orbital polarization levels @xcite .",
    "all experiments agree though that the degree of orbital polarization observed in actual superlattices is small compared to that needed to achieve a fully orbital polarized ni @xmath67 state .",
    "the main challenge is to then build the framework to understand how to create fully orbital polarized states in oxide heterostructures .",
    "one important facet of this problem has to do with strain and symmetry .",
    "for example , lanio@xmath2 has rhombohedral symmetry in the bulk which actually disfavors a uniaxial jahn - teller distortion @xcite .",
    "ndnio@xmath2 , on the other hand , is orthorhombic which allows such a distortion without large energetic penalties .",
    "recent studies by show that the nickelate films maintain to some extent the symmetry of the bulk , which , due to the connection between compatible lattice distortions and crystal symmetry , directly influences the ability to orbitally polarize the @xmath68-states even under large strains .    with this understanding ,",
    "one may be able to choose the proper bulk symmetry of the tmo to be used in the heterostructure to build in larger orbital polarizations in ndnio@xmath2 by coupling strain with the interfacial covalency effect discussed above and interfacial proximity effects @xcite .",
    "even for the case of ndnio@xmath2 films , however , the orbital polarization is still insufficient to create a fully polarized state @xcite .",
    "this is largely due to the energy scale mismatch between elastic strain ( @xmath18 100 mev ) and the bandwidth ( on order of several ev ) , and the overall tendency to orbital polarization is further reduced by the @xmath63 character of the ni@xmath43 state .",
    "small orbital polarizations have also been observed even in the case of the jahn - teller active manganites @xcite , which indicates that this balancing of drastically different energy scales is difficult even in systems that prefer orbital order .",
    "a potential solution is to create interfaces with large symmetry mismatch due to lattice topology or by combination of dissimilar crystal field environments .",
    "consider for example bulk oxides with large orbital polarization such as the cuprates @xcite and ruddlesden - popper ( layered - structure ) nickelates @xcite as a starting point . in these materials ,",
    "the large orbital polarization arises from the strongly asymmetric crystal ( ligand ) field of the layered structure .",
    "as was discussed above for the lcmo / ybco heterointerface , oxide interfaces can be harnessed to ` undo ' orbital polarization , but there is no reason why the converse should not also be possible .",
    "this offers a real opportunity in the area of matching systems with drastically different symmetries to create orbital states at the interface .",
    "orbital control can also be used to modulate strongly correlated states .",
    "strain very effectively controls the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) for ndnio@xmath2 thin films @xcite , but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood .",
    "using quantum confinement when the layer dimensions approach the atomic limit , it was observed that orbital polarization under compressive strain tends to favor a metallic state while quantum confinement caused a re - emergence of a mit through the interfacial reduction of the orbital polarization @xcite .",

    "antisite defects mean that real interfaces are not as sharp as depicted in the idealized sketches shown in this paper , and these defects are not necessarily easy to identify in transmission electron microscopy experiments , which average over columns of order @xmath82 atoms .",

    "methods to further define and control the actual structure of interfaces are urgently needed .",
    "one area of future study , is to couple the insight from _ in - situ _ studies of oxide film synthesis to that of multiscale theory in order to build a mechanistic understanding of the process by which interfaces are created .",
    "the importance and interest of oxide interfaces for the general issue of the theory of correlated electron materials can not be overemphasized .",
    "understanding the phenomena at interfaces requires a combination of sophisticated many - body physics ( to understand the correlated electron states ) and _ ab - initio _ insights ( to understand the implications of the changes in octahedral rotations , atomic coordination , and lattice relaxations ) .",
    "the present state of the theoretical art is a combination of analysis of model systems ( in particular the hubbard model ) , which can not easily encode many real materials aspects , in particular the transition - metal / ligand covalence as well as the energetics associated with lattice relaxations and _ ab - initio _ techniques ( especially the dft+@xmath37 method ) which have provided crucial insights but are based on a greatly oversimplified hartree approximation to the many - body physics and may overemphasize order @xcite . in particular the status of the dft+@xmath37 predictions of magnetism @xcite and charge order @xcite at the lao / sto interface remains unclear .",
    "the combination of density functional band theory and dynamical mean field theory ( dft+dmft ) is a promising alternative @xcite , combining _ ab - initio _ and many - body physics in a systematic way .",
    "however , working implementations of total energy calculations are only now beginning to appear @xcite and forces can not yet be computed so structural optimization remains a challenge .",
    "more fundamentally , existing implementations for systems in which more than one @xmath1-orbital is important are based on the single - site approximation , which is believed to become poor in the two dimensional situation relevant to heterostructures .",
    "topological insulators ( tis ) are a fascinating class of materials in which strong spin - orbit interaction promotes gapless electronic states on the surface ( @xmath12 edge states ) with the bulk of a material remaining gapped  @xcite .",
    "most of the current ti materials belong to the bi@xmath83 ( @xmath84=se , te ) family .",

    "the large polar discontinuity generally results in complex surface / interface and electronic reconstructions @xcite , which can act to compensate for the polar mismatch . to date",
    "there is limited understanding of thin film nucleation , growth and charge compensation in perovskites along highly polar directions . very recently",
    "the synthesis work in this direction has been initiated  @xcite .",
    "while many of the examples discussed above involve oxygen stoichiometric perovskites , the ease of removal / addition of oxygen can also offer opportunities for materials that can be programmed by their chemical environment @xcite .",
    "while the role of oxygen vacancies has been explored deeply in the context of catalysis and fuel cells @xcite , recent work has highlighted the controlled stabilization of related oxygen deficient phases using oxide heterostructures .",
    "this is interesting for epitaxial thin film phases such as srcoo@xmath88 @xcite or la@xmath89sr@xmath90feo@xmath88 @xcite , which can be reversibly converted between oxygen deficient and stoichiometric phases at low temperatures .",
    "since these phases have drastically different ground states , it offers an interesting path for control of strongly correlated electrons via dynamic anion compositional control . by combining low conversion energy with electrochemical gating of vacancies , such as",
    "that seen recently for vo@xmath6 @xcite and @xmath41nio@xmath2 @xcite , this approach allows direct control of metal vs. insulating phase as well as possible elements of brain - like ( neuromorphic ) electronic circuits .",
    "up to now , all the properties that have been discussed were limited to the quasi - equilibrium properties , but in the future one should also investigate the _ dynamical _ degree of freedom to explore the emergence of unique transient states .",
    "while the dynamic response for bulk materials has been extensively investigated  @xcite , oxide heterostructures offer new possibilities .",
    "recent pump - probe studies of oxide films illustrate the potential for ultrafast strain modulation  @xcite , which allows one to manipulate the lattice in a new direction since the film motion is clamped in - plane by epitaxy and can only alter the lattice out of plane . using this epitaxial",
    "constraint allows one to drive the crystalline lattice ( symmetry , rotations , etc ... ) into distinctly different areas of phase space .",
    "for example , experiments in manganite thin films showed the emergence of a _ hidden _ phase that existed only in the dynamic realm  @xcite .",
    "moving into the mid - ir region enables direct pumping of lattice modes that can trigger phase transitions  @xcite and was recently used to trigger a metal - insulator transition through dynamic strain created by direct pumping of substrate phonons  @xcite .",

    "<S> complex oxides with correlated carriers are a class of materials characterized by multiple competing and nearly degenerate ground states due to interactions that create a subtle balance to define their ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn leads to a wide diversity of intriguing properties ranging from high tc superconductivity to exotic magnetism and orbital phenomena . by utilizing bulk properties of these materials as a starting point , </S>",
    "<S> interfaces between different classes of correlated oxides offer a unique opportunity to break the fundamental symmetries of the bulk and alter the local environment . from experimental point of view , utilizing recent advances in growth with atomic layer precision one can now combine layers of compounds with distinct and even antagonistic order parameters to design new artificial quantum materials . here </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this approach by selected examples how broken lattice symmetry , strain , and altered chemical and electronic environments at the correlated interfaces can provide a unique platform to manipulate this subtle balance and enable quantum many - body states and phenomena not attainable in the bulk . </S>"
