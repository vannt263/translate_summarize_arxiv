    "the process of pair creation by the time independent and uniform electric field as described in our previous publication @xcite suffers from a serious drawback .",
    "the instantaneous switching on of the field leads to unphysical transient effects clearly seen in fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we solve analytically the problem of pair production by a uniform electric field that is _ switched on adiabatically_.    to explain what this means in physical terms , let us consider a large ( boundary conditions are disregarded ) capacitor charged so that the electric field is @xmath1 .",
    "we shall compare two cases . in the first case",
    ", the electric field is primordial , it existed always . in the second case ,",
    "the capacitor has been continuously charged until at @xmath2 the field reached the desired value @xmath1 .",
    "the creation of pairs in the first case , i.e. for the time - independent electric field , was calculated by schwinger @xcite whose analytical formula has a characteristic essential singularity as a function of the field strength @xmath3 .",
    "the removal of the schwinger singularity appearing in the title has the following meaning .",
    "consider the observer who at time @xmath2 can measure the strength of the electric field and the number of pairs but does not have information about the past history .",
    "this observer can plot the number of pairs as a function of the field strength and find out whether this dependence shows the singular behavior characteristic for the schwinger solution .",
    "we show with the help of exact analytic solutions that the singularity will not be found if the field has been turned on adiabatically .",
    "the formulas that describe the total pair production for an adiabatically switched field are analytic in the field strength ",
    "they can be expanded in the field strength into a convergent power series  for every finite value of the parameter @xmath4 , that sets the time scale of the charging process .",
    "the schwinger singularity in the field strength appears now as a singularity in @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the essential singularity found by schwinger is to be attributed entirely to rather unphysical assumptions that the field has infinite duration or that it has been suddenly switched on .",
    "the production of pairs by an adiabatic perturbation may seem impossible since there is an energy gap of @xmath5 between the vacuum state and the state with one pair .",
    "therefore , it would seem that under an adiabatic perturbation the vacuum will not change .",
    "however , these doubts should disappear when one realizes that pair production by a constant electric field is due to tunneling .",
    "arbitrarily weak electric field can produce an arbitrarily large difference in potential energy for a sufficiently large separation .",
    "when this difference in potential energy exceeds the value @xmath5 , pairs are created .",
    "the problem of pair production will be formulated in terms of a field - theoretic generalization of the standard , nonrelativistic , wigner function .",
    "the generalization was introduced in @xcite and called the dirac - heisenberg - wigner ( dhw ) function .",
    "this formulation was further developed in @xcite .",
    "it allows for a description of pair creation as a time evolution of the vacuum state .",
    "the advantage of using the dhw function is its applicability to the expectation values of field operators and not only to the one - particle wave functions that are solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "however , the analytic solutions of the one - particle dirac equation are still very useful .",
    "the method of spinorial decomposition introduced in @xcite enables one to construct from these solutions the components of the dhw function .",
    "we shall describe two exactly soluble examples .    in the first example the field is switched on at a constant rate @xmath4the time dependence is governed by a simple exponential . in the second example the field is switched on at a decreasing rate ",
    "the time dependence is governed by the hyperbolic secant squared . in both cases",
    "the signature of the emerging schwinger singularity is the shrinking of the radius of convergence to zero when @xmath4 tends to zero .",
    "we also show that in the first case the power expansion of the exact solution coincides with the straightforward perturbation theory .",
    "the evolution equation for the dhw function has many solutions , most of them do not represent physical states .",
    "the dhw function shares this property with the standard wigner function in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics  not every function over the phase - space is a wigner function . for example , the wigner function can not be concentrated too much in position and momentum since this would contradict the uncertainty relations",
    ". there is , however , a class of problems for which one can be sure that the wigner function represents a physically admissible state .",
    "these are the problems of time evolution with the initial value being a genuine wigner function .",
    "the dhw function that is the solution of the evolution equation will correspond to a physical state  the one that evolved from the initial state according to the schrdinger equation .",
    "this is precisely the method that is used in this work . to describe the time evolution under the influence of adiabatically switched on fields we shall always start with the easily computable exact dhw function  the one that describes the free vacuum state .    in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the wigner function",
    "is defined as a fourier integral of a product of wave functions and in many cases this integral can be explicitly evaluated .",
    "in contrast , the calculation of the dhw function in quantum field theory requires the summation of contributions from an infinite number of states of virtual particles in the vacuum .",
    "the only case where this can be easily done is the vacuum state of the free field .",
    "for that reason in our analysis of the time evolution we shall choose the dhw function of the vacuum as the initial value .",
    "in general , the evolution equations for the components of the dhw function , even in the approximation where all radiative corrections are neglected , form a set of 16 integro - differential equations and their analytic solution is a hopeless task . however , in the case of a spatially uniform electromagnetic field the evolution equations become tractable since they reduce to linear partial differential equations .",
    "these equations allow for the application of the method of characteristics leading to ordinary differential equations . in turn",
    ", these ordinary differential equations in certain cases can be solved analytically by spinorial decomposition introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we construct a complete set of solutions of the evolution equations for the dhw function describing the evolution of the vacuum in the presence of a uniform but time - dependent electric field . with the use of these solutions",
    "we find the evolution when the initial state is the free - field vacuum .",
    "our solution clarifies the mechanism responsible for pair production and may explain some details of the vacuum decay studied recently .    in sec .",

    "the number of produced pairs is slightly higher for the sauter field because , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , this field dominates over the exponentially growing field .",
    "the analytic character of the number of pairs function is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] where we plotted the dependence on @xmath123 in the neighborhood of zero .",

    "for comparison we also show a typical nonanalytic behavior representing the schwinger singularity . ]",
    "we have shown with the help of exact analytic solutions that adiabatic switching of the electric field removes the essential singularity which is present in the schwinger formula for pair creation . this observation opened the way to a perturbative treatment which gives the results coinciding with the power expansion of the exact solution .",
    "the method of spinorial decomposition that enabled us to find exact solutions is quite general and might be applicable to a class of similar problems .",
    "all calculations and the figures we produced with the help of mathematica @xcite .",
    "this research was partly supported by the grant from the polish ministry of science and higher education for the years 20102012 .",
    "the starting point is the expansion of the dirac field operator ( cf .",
    ", for example , @xcite ) into creation and annihilation operators ( c=1 ) , @xmath171.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we allowed for an arbitrary time dependence of the creation and annihilation operators , so that the validity of this formula is not restricted to free fields .",
    "next , we invert the fourier transform and use the properties of the spinors @xmath172 and @xmath173 to obtain @xmath174 with the use of the completeness relation for the spinors @xcite , @xmath175 expressed in the original dirac notation , we obtain the following formula for the number of electrons with momentum @xmath15 : @xmath176 now , we replace the product of field operators by the commutator and anticommutator and use the canonical equal - time anticommutation relations @xmath177.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have not assumed that the field operators obey the free dirac equation since we allowed in eq .",
    "( [ dirf ] ) for an arbitrary dependence of the creation and annihilation operators on @xmath178",
    ". however , in the presence of an external field we must introduce modifications required by gauge invariance .",
    "following the procedure that led to the formula ( [ dhw1 ] ) we replace the shift operators in eq .",
    "( [ nofel0 ] ) by their gauge invariant counterparts ( [ rel ] ) and extract the phase factor @xmath179 .",
    "the gauge invariant number operator @xmath180 obtained in this way is @xmath181 the expectation value of @xmath182 can then be expressed in terms of the dhw function .",
    "the quantity of interest is the pair density in phase space @xmath183 which in the present case is equal to the density of electrons .",
    "therefore , in the formula ( [ nofel ] ) we may drop the integration over @xmath184 and the normalization of the phase - space volume element @xmath185 to obtain the density of pairs per unit phase - space volume in the form @xmath186 due to the orthogonality of the dirac matrices under the trace only the components @xmath187 , and @xmath119 may contribute and we obtain the final formula @xmath188 the number of antiparticles calculated in the same manner is @xmath189 the difference between the two expressions is the charge density @xmath190 as was to be expected .",
