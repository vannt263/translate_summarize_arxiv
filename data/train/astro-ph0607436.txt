    "gravitational instability is commonly accepted as the basic mechanism for structure formation on large scales . combined with the cdm model it leads to the picture of hierarchical clustering with wide support from deep galaxy and cluster observations . during the recent phase of cosmic evolution groups and clusters of galaxies condense from large scale density enhancements , and they grow by accretion and merger processes of the environmental cosmic matter .    but despite the fact that the currently favoured  model has proven to be remarkably successful on large scales ( cf .",
    "wmap results , spergel et al . 2003 ,",
    "spergel et al . 2006 ) , recent high  resolution  simulations still seem to be in contradiction with observation on sub  galactic scales .",
    "there is , for instance , the problem with the steep central densities of galactic halos as the highest resolution simulations favor a cusp with a logarithmic inner slope for the density profile of approximately @xmath4 ( diemand , moore & stadel 2005 ; fukushige , kawai & makino 2004 ; power  2003 ) , whereas high resolution observations of low surface brightness galaxies are best fit by halos with a core of constant density ( simon  2005 ; de block & bosma 2002 ; swaters  2003 ) .",
    "a further problem relates to the overabundance of small ",
    "sized ( satellite ) halos ; there are many more subhaloes predicted by cosmological simulations than actually observed in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , moore et al .  1998 , klypin et al .  1999 , gottlber et al .",
    "the lack of observational evidence for these satellites has led to the suggestion that they are completely ( or almost completely ) dark , with strongly suppressed star formation due to the removal of gas from the small protogalaxies by the ionising radiation from the first stars and quasars ( bullock et  al .",
    "2000 ; tully et  al . 2002",
    "; somerville 2002 ; hoeft  2005 ) .",
    "other authors suggest that perhaps low mass satellites never formed in the predicted numbers in the first place , indicating problems with the  model in general , which is replaced with warm dark matter instead ( knebe  2002 ; bode , ostriker  & turok 2001 ; coln  2000 ) . suggested solutions also include the introduction of self - interactions into collisionless  simulations ( e.g. spergel  & steinhardt 2000 ; bento  2000 ) , and non - standard modifications to an otherwise unperturbed cdm power spectrum ( e.g.  bumpy power spectra : little , knebe  & islam 2003 ; tilted cdm : bullock 2001c ) .",
    "recent results from ( strong ) lensing statistics though suggest that the predicted excess of substructure is in fact required to reconcile some observations with theory ( dahle  2003 , dalal  & kochanek 2002 ) , but this conclusion has not been universally accepted ( sand  2004 ; schechter  & wambsganss 2002 ; evans  & witt 2003 ) .    the discovery of the mismatch between observations and simulations is a result of the increase in the resolution of  simulations over the last years .",
    "this has emphasized the importance of the influence of subresolution scales on the simulated dynamics , at least when it comes to halo properties .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the hydrodynamic  like formulation of the formation of cosmologial structure proposed recently by domnguez  ( 2000 ) , dubbed sse ( small  size expansion ) .",
    "the sse addresses explicitly the existence of a finite spatial resolution and the dynamical effect of subresolution degrees of freedom .",
    "although developed independently , the sse approach is close in spirit to the large  eddy simulation of turbulent flow ( see , e.g. , pope 2000 and refs .",
    "therein ) . this is a method devised to simulate only the relevant , large ",
    "scale degrees of freedom according to the navier ",
    "stokes equations describing flow in the high  reynolds number ( i.e. , turbulent ) regime : physically meaningful approximations are made in order to model the coupling to the neglected , small  scale degrees of freedom .",
    "the sse starts from the microscopic equations of motion for a set of @xmath3 particles under their mutual gravity and provides a set of hydrodynamic - like equations for the ( coarse  grained ) mass density and velocity fields .",
    "these new equations now contain `` correction terms '' which describe the effects of the coarse  graining procedure and correct for them , respectively .",
    "it therefore only appears natural to implement these correction terms into an ( adaptive ) mesh  code where the density is treated in a coarse  grained fashion , too : mesh  based poisson solvers frequently used for cosmological simulations smooth the particle distribution onto a grid and hence deal with a coarse  grained density field when solving for the potential via poisson s equation . for this purpose we will adapt the open source  code ` mlapm `  ( multi - level adaptive particle  mesh ) .",
    "the particles of the  simulations presented in this study are effectively hydrodynamical lagrangian particles which move under the action not only of the mesh  computed gravitational force , but also of the additional , correction terms modeling sub  grid degrees of freedom in the context of the sse .",
    "the rest of the work is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ happi ] we describe the theoretical background of the sse and provide the link to mesh  based  codes . in sec .",
    "[ nbody ] we present the simulation of several models ( standard  model ,  model , and two runs incorporating the sse corrections ) . in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] we perform a comparative analysis of the four runs at redshift @xmath0 from two complementary points of view : properties of the mass density and velocity fields , and properties of halos .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] includes a discussion of the results and the conclusions .",
    "we deal with a system of nonrelativistic , identical point particles which ( i ) are supposed to interact with each other via gravity only , ( ii ) look homogeneously distributed on sufficiently large scales , so that the evolution at such scales corresponds to an expanding friedmann - lematre cosmological background , and ( iii ) deviations to homogeneity are relevant only on scales small enough that a newtonian approximation is valid to follow their evolution .",
    "let @xmath5 then denote the expansion factor of the friedmann - lematre cosmological background , @xmath6 the associated hubble function , and @xmath7 the homogeneous ( background ) density on large scales .",
    "@xmath8 is the comoving spatial coordinate of the @xmath9-th particle , @xmath10 its peculiar velocity , and @xmath11 its mass . in terms of these variables",
    "the evolution is described by the following set of equations ( peebles 1980 ) ( @xmath12 denotes a partial derivative with respect to @xmath8 ) :    [ newton ] @xmath13 , \\\\",
    "\\nabla_\\alpha \\times { \\bf w}_\\alpha & = & { \\bf 0 } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the peculiar gravitational acceleration acting on the @xmath9-th particle .",
    "finally , eqs .",
    "( [ newton ] ) must be subjected to periodic boundary conditions in order to yield a newtonian description consistent with the friedmann - lematre solution on large scales ( buchert  & ehlers 1997 ) .    if we now assume that the actual measure of the density field in an  code depends on a smoothing window @xmath15 , the microscopic field @xmath16 relates to the measured ( coarse  grained ) field @xmath17 in the following way :    [ density ] @xmath18    the physical interpretation of the field @xmath19 follows straightforwardly from the properties of the smoothing window : it is proportional to the number of particles contained within the coarsening cell of size @xmath20 centered at @xmath21 . a microscopic peculiar ",
    "momentum density field and the corresponding coarse  grained field can be defined in the same way :    [ momentum ] @xmath22    one can introduce peculiar velocity fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 by definition as @xmath25 and similarly for @xmath23 .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath26 is also simple : it is the center - of - mass peculiar velocity of the subsystem defined by the particles inside the coarsening cell of size @xmath20 centered at @xmath21 .",
    "notice that @xmath27 is _ not _ obtained by coarse - graining @xmath23 : from a dynamical point of view , it is more natural to coarse  grain the momentum rather than the velocity , since the former is an additive quantity for a system of particles",
    ". finally , one can define peculiar gravitational acceleration fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 through coarse  graining of the force :    [ acceleration ] @xmath30    the field @xmath31 has the physical meaning of the center - of - mass peculiar gravitational acceleration of the subsystem defined by the coarsening cell at @xmath21 .    from these definitions and eqs .",
    "( [ newton ] ) , it is straightforward to derive the evolution equations obeyed by the coarse  grained fields @xmath17 and @xmath27 ( from now on , @xmath32 is taken at constant @xmath21 and l , and @xmath33 means partial derivative with respect to @xmath21 ) :    [ hydro ] @xmath34 @xmath35    where a new second - rank tensor field has been defined ( dyadic notation ) : @xmath36    [ { \\bf u}_{mic}({\\bf y } , t ) - { \\bf u } ( { \\bf x } , t ; l ) ] .",
    "\\nonumber   \\ ] ]    the field @xmath37 is due to the velocity dispersion , i.e. , to the fact that the particles in the coarsening cell have in general a velocity different from that of the center of mass .",
    "the physical meaning of eqs .",
    "( [ hydro ] ) is simple : they are just balance equations , stating mass conservation and momentum conservation , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath38 codifies the gravitational interaction between the coarsening cells and does not satify , in general , poisson s equation or the curl  free condition .",
    "the term @xmath39 represents a _",
    "kinetic _ pressure force due to the exchange of particles between neighboring coarsening cells ( just like for an ideal gas ) and it has the same physical origin as the convective term @xmath40 , i.e. , a nonlinear mode - mode coupling of the velocity field .",
    "the difference is that the convective term couples only modes on scales @xmath41 , while the velocity dispersion term codifies the dynamical effect of the coupling of the modes on scales @xmath41 with the modes on scales @xmath42 .",
    "( [ hydro ] ) are _ exact _ : as one changes the smoothing length , the fields @xmath17 , @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath43 change in such a way that the form of the equations remains the same ( for example , upon increase of the smoothing length , part of the dynamical effect described by @xmath40 is shifted towards @xmath39 ) .",
    "this property is reflected in that the equations are not an autonomous system for @xmath17 and @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , they are just the first ones of an infinite hierarchy , as can be checked by computing the evolution equations for the fields @xmath29 and @xmath43 . to obtain a useful set of equations , it is necesary to truncate this hierarchy by looking for a functional dependence of @xmath29 and @xmath43 on @xmath17 and @xmath27 .",
    "the peculiarities of the problem at hand ( collisionless matter in the non  stationary state of structure formation ) prevent the usual truncation of the hierarchy leading to the euler or navier  stokes equations , respectively ( see , e.g. , chapman & cowling 1991 ) .",
    "the _ small  size expansion _ ( sse ) is a specific truncation for this problem ( domnguez 2000 , 2002 ; buchert & domnguez 2005 ) , that starts from the physical assumption that the coupling to the small  scales is weak ( this can be argued on the basis that , in a hierarchical scenario , the smaller scales `` virialize '' earlier and thus `` decouple '' from the evolution of the larger scales ) .",

    "mean  field _ gravity created by the monopole moment of the matter distribution in the coarsening cells , i.e. , the total mass , and the coupling to the small  scales is neglected altogether . to order @xmath46 there are two kinds of corrections : the term proportional to the tidal tensor @xmath58 ( stemming from a term @xmath59 in eqs .",
    "( [ hydro ] ) ) models the gravitational force of the higher  order multipole moments , i.e. , the coupling to the subresolution _ configurational _ degrees of freedom ; the term proportional to @xmath60 ( stemming from @xmath43 in eqs .",
    "( [ hydro ] ) ) models the effect of velocity dispersion , that is , the coupling to the subresolution _",
    "kinetic _ degrees of freedom .    the expected dynamical effect of these new terms with respect to the `` dust evolution '' has been studied theoretically ( domnguez 2000 , 2002 ; buchert & domnguez 2005 ) .",
    "there is evidence that , assuming a locally plane  parallel collapse , these terms mimick the `` adhesion model '' ( gurbatov , saichev  & shandarin 1989 , sahni & coles 1995 ) , in which recently collapsed regions stabilize  or more generally speaking , the term due to velocity dispersion tends to reduce the inflow velocity in collapsing regions and favors the formation of gravitationally bound systems .",
    "it has also been shown that the correction terms act as a source of vorticity via small  scale tidal forces and shear stresses . the  dust model  lacks a source of vorticity @xmath61 , and the initially present one is damped by the cosmological expansion in the linear regime .",

    "( [ dotu ] ) we recover the equations of motions that are being integrated in a standard pm code for the update of particle velocities and positions during the course of the simulation .",
    "the  simulations presented in this study were carried out using a version of the open source adaptive mesh refinement code ` mlapm `  ( knebe , green  & binney 2001 ) .",
    "this code reaches high force resolution by refining high - density regions with an automated refinement algorithm .",
    "these adaptive meshes are recursive : refined regions can also be refined , each subsequent refinement having cells that are half the size of the cells in the previous level .",
    "this creates a hierarchy of refinement meshes of different resolutions covering regions of interest .",
    "the refinement is done cell by cell ( individual cells can be refined or de - refined ) and meshes are not constrained to have a rectangular ( or any other ) shape . the criterion for ( de-)refining a cell is simply the number of particles within that cell and a detailed study of the appropriate choice for this number can be found elsewhere ( knebe et al .",
    "the code also uses multiple time steps on different refinement levels where the time step for each level is two times smaller than the step on the previous level .",
    "the latest version of ` mlapm `  also includes an adaptive time stepping that adjusts the actual time step after every major step to restrict particle movement across a cell to a particular fraction of the cell spacing , hence , fine tuning accuracy and computational time .    as outlined above , the only necessary modification required to model the `` * * h**ydrodynamic * * app**rox**i**mation '' ( or `` happi '' here afterwards ) is to account for the correction term @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ dotu ] ) when updating the particle velocities . `",
    "mlapm `  has therefore been modified to not only calculate the density field on its hierarchy of nested refinement grids but also the velocity field .",
    "the @xmath33-operator and spatial derivatives , respectively , have been approximated by finite - differences using the two nearest neighbors ( in each dimension ) to the cell for which the correction term is being calculated .",
    "cells close to a refinement boundary for which not enough surrounding nodes are present , obtain their correction values interpolated downwards from the next coarser grid level .",
    "the assignment of mass and momentum on the grid is done with a triangular  shaped ",

    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "we remark that , due to the dynamical ( de)refinement procedure of the ` mlapm `  code , the resolution is space  dependent in a discrete manner , while eqs .",
    "( [ hydrosmallk ] ) were derived under the assumption of a spatially homogeneous length @xmath45 .",
    "the sse can be generalized to the case of a smoothly varying @xmath74 ( domnguez , unpublished ; domnguez 2002 contains the generalization to a time ",
    "dependent @xmath45 ) , but we have neglected this additional complication because the fraction of particles which are in regions where @xmath45 jumps is less than @xmath75 during the run . finally , we also note that this numerical method of integrating the hydrodynamic equations is different from , albeit similar to , the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method ( gingold & monaghan 1977 ; lucy 1977 ) frequently used in cosmological simulations involving baryonic matter .",
    "we ran four cdm simulations with cosmological parameters in agreement with the so - called concordance model , i.e. @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 :    * one standard  model , * one  model ( @xmath80kev ) , * two  models with @xmath54=1/4 and @xmath54=1 , respectively .    even though @xmath54 is actually determined by the smoothing window",
    ", we also considered a four times larger value as if it were a free parameter of the model .",
    "this model is to be understood as an `` academic toy model '' where we hope to gain better insight into the effects of the correction term on cosmological structure formation .",
    "all simulations consist of @xmath81 particles in a box of side length 25  ( the mass of a simulation particle is @xmath82 ) , and they were started at redshift @xmath83 .",
    "the two  models with @xmath840 are also dubbed happi1 ( @xmath54=1/4 ) and happi2 ( @xmath54=1 ) .",
    "we chose to also run a  model to allow for a more complete comparision of the new happi models to other , alternative cosmologies .",
    "a more elaborate study of the  model and warm dark matter can be found in knebe  ( 2002 ) .",
    "the force resolution in ` mlapm `  is determined by the finest refinement level reached throughout the run . while all four models applied exactly the same refinement criterion ( six particles per cell ) , the happi2 run only invoked five refinement levels whereas all other runs used seven levels at redshift @xmath0 . in terms of force resolution",
    "this translates to 10  spatial resolution for happi2 ( corresponding to an estimated maximum density @xmath85 ) and 2.5  for all the other models ( maximum density @xmath86 ) .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to the smoothening effect of the correction terms in the dynamical equations that are more effective for higher values of @xmath54 .",

    "whereas , happi1 , and  reached 2.5  resolution , happi2 reliably resolves structures only on scales larger than 10 . moreover , the resolution can also change from halo to halo due to the adaptive mesh nature of both the halo finder and the  code : not all halo centres lie on the finest grid level reached in the simulation . however , we plot profiles starting from the distance @xmath126 that corresponds to a sphere containing at least 10 particles ( and hence @xmath126 can be actually smaller than the nominal resolution of the simulation ) .",

    "while the maximum is still at comparable distances in  and happi1 , the latter shows a steeper inner increase and a subsequent faster decline to nearly the same level in the `` outer '' parts .",

    "we have presented a series of cosmological  simulations which made use of the hydrodynamic approach to the evolution of structures ( domnguez 2000 ) .",
    "this approach is novel in that it deals with the mass density and velocity fields with explicit account of the coarse - grained nature intrinsic to any approach of solving , for instance , poisson s equation via monte carlo sampling of phase - space .",
    "this  approach unavoidably introduces finite resolution effects and there have been systematic studies of the consequences in the context of cosmological structure formation ( kuhlman , melott & shandarin 1996 ; splinter 1998 ; moore 1998 ; knebe 2000 ; power 2003 )",
    ".  simulations invariably neglect the dynamical effect of sub  resolution degrees of freedom altogether . for the first time we have run simulations including a physical model of the coupling to the neglected scales .",
    "codes are usually viewed as integrators of the vlasov  poisson system of equations .",
    "however , we have argued how grid  based   codes such as ` mlapm `  can be reinterpreted to integrate hydrodynamic  like equations for the mass density and velocity fields .",
    "the additional , correction term introduced in the hydrodynamic approach is proportional to a `` coupling constant '' @xmath54 which depends on the smoothing window used to calculate the coarse - grained fields .",
    "it is found to be @xmath73 for the triangular  shaped ",
    "cloud window used throughout the  code ` mlapm ` . in order to get a better understanding of the effects of the correction term onto the evolution of cosmic structures we also performed a simulation with a higher value @xmath129",
    " this later model is not physically motivated but rather serves as an `` academic toy model '' for comparison .",
    "the standard  simulation can be understood as another happi run with the value @xmath69 . in order to allow for a better comparison with other feasible alternatives to the concordance  model as well as to better gauge the influence of the correction term",
    ", we also simulated the evolution of the same structures in a  universe . in this work we concentrated on the comparison of the four simulations at redshift @xmath0 .",
    "we analyzed the resulting structures in two complementary manners : global properties of the mass density and velocity fields , on the one hand , and specific properties of dm halos , on the other hand .",
    "we find appreciable differences between the @xmath130 runs and the reference ( @xmath69 )  run , even though the force due to the correction terms are for most particles one or even two orders of magnitude smaller than the total force ( cf .",
    "[ happidens ] ) .",
    "most remarkably , the correction term favors the proliferation of low  mass halos , giving the mass distribution a more `` grainy '' aspect , as well as the gain of angular momentum specially by low ",
    "mass halos , which also shows up in a velocity field with a larger vorticity .",
    "these effects are quantitatively larger as the value of @xmath54 increases ; for @xmath73 the differences lie at the @xmath131 level ( and even higher for the specific angular momentum at low masses ) .",
    "a feature in which the @xmath73 and @xmath129 runs exhibit an opposite trend with respect to the @xmath69 run is the concentration of high  mass halos : the @xmath129 run results in an overabundance of high  mass halos with a lower concentration this is paralleled by a smaller circular velocity of these halos , and by the relative lack of power in the spectrum of density fluctuations at sufficiently small scales , so that the maximum density reached in the @xmath129 run is much smaller than in the other runs .",
    "the @xmath73 run , however , shows precisely the opposite tendency with respect to the reference run .",
    "one can conjecture that this discrepancy between the @xmath73 and @xmath129 runs lies in a difference in the rate of shear and vorticity generation and of kinetic energy drainage by the correction term .",
    "a comparative study of the structures at different redshifts is required in order to obtain more precise conclusions about this issue .",
    "the relatively small quantitative differences between the @xmath73 and the @xmath69 runs evidenced in the properties that we have measured suggest that the @xmath73 correction term could be considered a small perturbation to the @xmath69 evolution .",
    "by contrast , the results of the @xmath129 run indicate that the correction term should not be treated as a perturbation in this case .",
    "our results agree with the theoretical expectation for the qualitative behavior of the correction term , which models the effect of small  scale tidal torques and shear stresses ( domnguez 2000 , 2002 ; buchert & domnguez 2005 ) .",
    "we observed that the correction term is dominant preferentially in walls at high redshifts , and later on in filaments , regions of mass accretion onto halos , halo centers as well as in regions of particular dynamical activity ( e.g. , mergers ) , that is , regions of large gradients in the fields , in concordance with the form of the correction term  ( [ correction ] ) .",
    "the term is expected to act as a drain of kinetic energy in collapsing regions : this can explain the formation of small clusters of particles , which would otherwise fly by each other  instead , they can be gravitationally confined by a potential well that is lower than in the @xmath69 model .",
    "this could explain the low mass halo proliferation for @xmath132 or @xmath133 , as well as the observed tendency of halos to attain a slightly more concentrated configuration in the case of @xmath73 , when the correction term can be considered a small perturbation . if @xmath129 , on the other hand , the loss of kinetic energy is apparently so important that , in some cases of halos in regions of high dynamical activity , dynamical relaxation and coalescence are slowed down noticeably , leading to a multiple - core structure .",
    "these not completely relaxed halos would then have a lower concentration and a lower mass than their lcdm counterparts , similarly to the simulation results .",
    "we further confirmed explicitly that the correction term acts as a source of vorticity .",
    "this relates directly to the gain in angular momentum of halos , which tends to increase with growing value of @xmath54 , especially at the low  mass end of the halo distribution .",
    "finally , we remark that our findings agree qualitatively with conclusions following from a comparative study of identical initial conditions evolved at different resolutions .",
    "we have run a series of test simulations where we either switched on the happi correction term or increased the actual force resolution ; both methods lead to comparable results that are in qualitative agreement with the conclusions presented here . for a more quantitative analysis",
    "we though refer the reader to a future paper in preparation where we will investigate the relationship between happi simulations and higher - resolution ones in more detail .",
    "the proliferation of small halos with increasing resolution has also been reported by other authors in and around ( massive ) halos ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 , moore 1998 ) as well as in voids ( gottlber 2003 ) . concerning the generation of angular momentum though",
    ", the relevance for the formation of realistic disk galaxies has yet to be determined but there are clear indications that this task requires good mass and force resolution ( governato  2004 ) . in conclusion , the happi implementation seems indeed to be qualitatively consistent with what one expects from higher resolution simulations and hence may provide a framework for a better understanding of resolution effects in  simulations .",
