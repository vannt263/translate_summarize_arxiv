    "in recent years , the process of multiphoton ionization ( mpi ) of atomic and molecular species has been a subject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies ( see reviews by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "rapid progress in this field has been largely driven by advancement in high - power short - pulse laser techniques . the laser intensities which may go beyond @xmath0  w@xmath1 make it possible to observe many striking phenomena such as mpi and above - threshold ionization .",
    "accurate theoretical description of ionization processes occurring in laser fields of such intensities should necessarily go beyond a simple perturbative picture .",
    "the first nonperturbative theory of mpi was proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their theory ( known as kfr ) treated the process of mpi as a transition of an electron from an initial bound state into a final state described by the classical volkov wave function .",
    "the kfr approach provided simple analytical formulas for the mpi rate which were found in a qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "various modifications of the kfr theory were made , in particular those accounting for the rescattering process @xcite .",
    "the kfr theory treated the laser field purely classically .",
    "the mpi problem can also be formulated in an entirely quantum form .",
    "the properties of the scattering matrix in this formulation of the mpi process have been studied starting from the works of mower @xcite , gontier et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite and guo , aberg and crasemann @xcite put forward an mpi theory ( referred hereafter as gac ) which treats the photoionization process as a qed scattering phenomenon .",
    "the emphasis in this theory was placed on a proper qed description of an electron interacting with the laser field ( the quantum version of the volkov states ) .",
    "further development of the qed picture of the mpi phenomenon was made by @xcite and @xcite who refined the original gac theory by including the non - laser modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this fully qed approach , although solving the problem in principle , was found to be rather difficult to implement in practice even for simplest atomic targets such as one- or two - electron atoms .",
    "for instance , @xcite had to make further drastic approximations in order to carry out their calculation of mpi on atomic hydrogen .",
    "one possible solution to this problem is to use some suitable square - integrable basis to represent the green functions occuring in the theory .",
    "such approach , using ideas of the complex rotation method , has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "another solution is to use the field - free atomic states as building blocks of the theory .",
    "such a choice is particularly advantageous when theory is applied to complex atomic systems with more than one target electron .",
    "such approach within the context of the complex rotation method has been used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "description of the quantum mechanical evolution of an atom coupled to a laser field is also possible in the framework of this method @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we outline a quantum formalism for mpi which we intend to use for practical computations on complex atomic systems .",
    "the formalism is not entirely new and is based on the ideas expressed earlier in the literature .",
    "the main emphasis of this work is on the pracical implementation of the formlism and turning it into an efficient computational procedure . in this development",
    "we are inspired by a series of works by burke and collaborators who combined the floquet description of the laser field with the @xmath2-matrix scattering theory .",
    "following the seminal work @xcite , this approach has been successfully implemented for calculating the total mpi rate and the level shift in atomic hydrogen @xcite , helium @xcite , the negative hydrogen ion @xcite and molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "most recently the @xmath2-matrix floquet theory was combined with the basis spline technique to describe the two - electron mpi from the helium atom in the ground @xcite and excited states @xcite .",
    "in addition to the total mpi rate , some differential cross - sections can be also calculated within the floquet formalism as was demonstrated for atomic hydrogen by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is the most detailed fully differential cross - sections that are of particular interest to experimentalists and that we intend to evaluate in our approach .    in the present paper",
    "we employ the operator formalism due to @xcite . in this formalism , the mpi process is treated as a decay phenomenon .",
    "the partial decay rates and the energy level shifts are evaluated via the matrix elements of the transition operator which are found by solving a coupled set of the integral lippmann - schwinger equations . in this approach",
    "the matrix elements of the transition operator should be taken between the field - free atomic states accompanied by an integer number of the laser photons .",
    "for one - electron targets , evaluation of the field - free states is trivial . for two - electron targets , an accurate set of target states , both discrete and continuous ,",
    "can be generated by the so - called convergent close coupling ( ccc ) method .",
    "this method has been extensively tested for processes with two electrons in the continuum such as electron scattering on atomic hydrogen @xcite and low - field double ionization of helium @xcite .",
    "we intend to use the same set of target states for mpi of he in the non - perturbative strong - field regime .    in our approach",
    "we ignore all the processes of spontaneous emission of photons , which is justified as we are interested in processes induced by strong fields .",
    "since the work of @xcite , it is known that if one neglects spontaneous processes in the quantum description of the interaction of laser light and atom , then the quantum picture and the floquet method of solving the time - dependent schrodinger equation become equiavalent .",
    "therefore , the present approach and the ones based on the floquet anzats ( such as @xcite , for example ) are completely equivalent .",
    "however , recasting the mpi description in the form presented below may have some practical advantages , especially if we have good means of representing the field - free atomic states for complex atomic systems .",
    "this includes , of course , the states belonging to the continious spectrum . such means do exist .",
    "as mentioned above , the ccc method turned out to be very efficient at representing field - free states of atomic systems .",
    "it was the desire to exploit fully the possibilities provided by ccc technique that largely motivated us to give a formulation of the mpi process presented below .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ]",
    "we give a formulation of the mpi theory in terms of the field - free atomic states . in section  [ s4 ]",
    "we consider a model square - well problem , and in section [ sh ] the mpi of hydrogen .",
    "we conclude in section  [ s5 ] by outlining a set of problems we intend to consider in the immediate future .",
    "let us consider a system which consists of a number of photons with a given frequency @xmath3 and momentum vector @xmath4 corresponding to an incident plane - wave , and a target ( atom or ion ) .",
    "we shall describe the field fully quantum - mechanically and write the hamiltonian of the system as @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 have the usual meaning of the hamiltonians of the atom and the field : @xmath8 the atomic hamiltonian is taken in a non - relativistic form .",
    "the number operator @xmath9 refers to the laser photons only ..    the corresponding states of the system consisting of the non - interacting atom and the field are denoted as @xmath10 defines a state of the atom and @xmath11 is the number of the laser photons .",
    "the following notations will be kept throughout the paper : greek letters will be used to designate the states of a whole system `` the atom plus external field '' , while the latin letters will be used for the atomic states .",
    "the atomic system of units is in use with @xmath12 .",
    "the part of the hamiltonian @xmath13 which describes the interaction of the atom and the linearly polarized laser field characterized by angular frequency @xmath3 , wave - vector @xmath4 and polarization vector @xmath14 can be written as ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the momentum operator and @xmath17 is a quantized vector potential normalized to the unit volume : @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 have the usual meaning of the operators creating and annihilating a photon . as mentioned above , we are interested in sufficiently strong field intencities , when all processes of spontaneous emission of photons can be neglected . for this reason , only one mode corresponding to the wavevector of the incident laser filed is kept in eq .",
    "( [ as ] ) .",
    "therefore , here and below , @xmath17 describes the laser photons only .",
    "we also restrict ourselves with the dipole approximation in which the operator @xmath17 does not act on the atomic coordinates .",
    "the matrix elements of the vector potential operator taken between the noninteracting states of the system `` atom plus laser photons '' are given by the well - known formulas ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an arbirtary vector operator acting only on the coordinates of the atomic subsystem .",
    "in strong fields @xmath23 and the coefficients in ( [ mea ] ) can be simplified to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electric field strength related to the energy density as @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to the following formulas for the matrix elements of the operator @xmath27 : @xmath28 we shall treat the mpi process as a decay phenomenon within the framework of the quantum decay theory as described by @xcite .",
    "we shall be interested in the following process . at the moment @xmath29 the system `` atom plus external field '' is prepared in the eigenstate @xmath30 of the hamiltonian @xmath31 .",
    "then interaction @xmath27 between atomic and photon subsystems is switched on .",
    "our aim is to describe possible outcomes of this event .",
    "the partial rates of the decay of the initial states @xmath30 into various open channels @xmath32 are given by the expressions @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the density of states in the final state , and the transition operator @xmath35 satisfies the operator equation @xcite @xmath36 here @xmath37 is a projection operator on the initial state @xmath30 . in eq .",
    "( [ tm1 ] ) both the matrix element of the transition operator and the density of states are to be computed at the energy , corresponding to the shifted energy of the initial state @xmath30 : @xmath38 finally , the energy shift @xmath39 of the final state is related to the diagonal matrix element of the transition operator via implicit equation @xcite @xmath40 the form of the latter equation suggests a possiblity of an iterative scheme for the determination of the level shift",
    ". equations ( [ tm1])-([tm3 ] ) provide the basis of our calculation scheme for evaluating the rates of various multiphoton processes .    in the alternative formalism @xcite , when the mpi process is treated as a scattering phenomenon , the expression for the @xmath35-operator",
    "must be corrected for the virtual transitions between various photodetachment channels .",
    "this correction comes from a careful examination of the boundary conditions which must be imposed on a scattering wave function in the floquet representation . in its simplest form , this can be achieved by dividing the conventional expression for the matrix element of the @xmath35-operator by a bessel function @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the problem outlined by eqs .",
    "( [ tm1 ] ) -([tm3 ] ) is a decay , or an initial state , problem . as such",
    ", it requires an accurate evaluation of the initial state which subsequently decays into various open channels .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ tm1 ] ) is a result of evaluation of the quantum mechanical amplitude @xmath42 where @xmath43 evolves from the state @xmath30 at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "therefore no additional correction to the transition amplitudes ( [ tm2 ] ) is needed .    by introducing in eq .",
    "( [ tm2 ] ) a complete set of states of @xmath44 , this equation can be rewritten in the form of a spectral representation : @xmath45 here the sign of @xmath46 gives the rule of bypassing the pole when performing the integration over the continuum spectrum .",
    "the shift of the energy of the initial state is explicitely included into the set of eqs.([ls4 ] )",
    ". this circumstance may be especially important for the atomic systems with more that one electron .",
    "when the escaping electron leaves the atomic system , the remaining ion still interacts with the electromagnetic field , the energy shift in the eqs.([ls4 ] ) takes into account effects of this interaction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we give a graphical representation of eq .",
    "( [ ls4 ] ) . here",
    "a straight line with an arrow to the right represents a target atom and the dashed lines are used to depict the photons .",
    "a vertex with two electron lines and one photon line represents a dipole matrix element ( [ me ] ) which incorporates many - electron correlation in the target . for simplicity we do not show the quadrupole and monopole matrix elements ( [ ls4 ] ) which are parametrically small for not very strong fields @xmath47 .",
    "a rectangular block stands for the @xmath35-matrix ( [ ls4 ] ) . in the low - field regime the integral term in the right - hand side of ( [ ls4 ] ) can be ignored and the atomic ionization is described by the bare matrix element @xmath48 .",
    "the strong field effects are incorporated in the integral term and include multiple absorption and emission of the laser photons .",
    "= 16 cm    the sum over the spectrum of @xmath49 in ( [ ls4 ] ) includes summation over various number of photons as well as summation over bound atomic states and integration over the continuous spectrum of the atom .",
    "computation of the integral in ( [ ls4 ] ) can be greatly simplified by introducing a discrete set of target pseudostates which provides an adequate quadrature rule . as the result of such a discretization",
    "the set of equations ( [ ls4 ] ) becomes a linear system on the unknown elements of the @xmath35-matrix .",
    "once this linear system is solved , all information about the integral and differential features of the mpi process can be obtained from the matrix elements of the @xmath35-operator taken at the energy corresponding to the shifted energy of the final state as in eq .",
    "( [ tm1 ] ) ( the so - called on - shell matrix elements ) .",
    "we note that in the weak field limit summation in ( [ ls4 ] ) can be restricted to the atomic variables and we arrive to the expression for the dipole matrix element given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) of @xcite .      to illustrate feasibility of our approach",
    "we first apply it to a model problem of an mpi process from a one - dimensional square well .",
    "it is this model system that was considered by @xcite in their seminal paper which gave rise to the spectacular success of the @xmath2-matrix floquet theory .",
    "we consider here an electron bound initially in a square well potential @xmath50 a.u . for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 , with the boundary condition @xmath54 imposed on the wave functions .",
    "this potential supports only one bound state @xmath55 with an energy @xmath56 a.u .",
    "we consider an mpi process when the electric field with the frequency @xmath57 is applied such that at least three photons are needed to ionize the system . to solve this problem",
    "we follow the steps outlined in sec .",
    "the set of equations ( [ ls4 ] ) is converted into a linear system on the @xmath35-matrix elements by choosing a suitable discretization procedure for the continuous spectrum integration .",
    "the summation over a set of intermediate states @xmath58 in the eq .",
    "( [ ls4 ] ) is a sum over various numbers of photons @xmath59 and summation and integration over the set of variables specifying the field - free electron states . for the square well model the latter",
    "are determined by a single quantum number ( momentum of the states belonging to the continuous spectrum or energy of the discrete spectrum ) . for a given number of photons in the set of intermediate states @xmath58",
    "we first determine if there is a pole in the integral over the continuous spectrum .",
    "similarly to electron scattering calculations of @xcite , we divide the momentum integration interval @xmath60 into five subintervals .",
    "if the pole is present in the integral , the first two subintervals are chosen to be @xmath61 and @xmath62 with a typical number of 60 momentum points in each interval .",
    "then the delta - function singularity is isolated and the remaining principle value integral is evaluated by a modified simpson s rule @xcite . the remaining part of the momentum integral is divided as follows : @xmath63 ( 50 integration points ) , @xmath64 ( 40 points ) and @xmath65 ( 40 points ) .",
    "these intervals are pole - free and the integration is performed by using a conventional simpson s rule .",
    "if there is no pole in a given channel the integration procedure remains essentially the same except for the boundary of the first and second intervals which is chosen at one atomic unit of momentum . in this case the conventional simpson s rule is used throughout .",
    "we retained various numbers of photons in the intermediate state of eq .",
    "( [ ls4 ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we count this number from the baseline of three photons in the initial state which we denote as @xmath66 . in the intermediate and final states we can then have negative numbers of photons .",
    "for example , @xmath67 in the final state @xmath68 would mean that four photons have been absorbed . using this convention ,",
    "the calculations we performed can be denoted as ( @xmath69 ) meaning that the number of photons in the intermediate and final states ranges from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .    the problem which arises immediately when one tries to apply eqs.([ls4 ] ) for the square - well model is the singularity of the matrix elements @xmath72",
    "when both states @xmath73 lie in the continuum .",
    "this is , of course , a consequence of the choice of the gauge of the vector potential in formulas ( [ hint ] ) .",
    "fortunately , as we shall show in the section , this problem can be avoided for real atomic systems by choosing the interaction hamiltonian in the kramers - hennerberger ( acceleration ) form . for the square - well",
    "potential such choice of the interaction hamiltonian is not possible due to the singular character of the potential .",
    "we shall have , therefore , to devise a suitable procedure of the regularization of the matrix elements of operator ( [ hint ] ) when both states belong to continious spectrum .",
    "there is vast amount of literature devoted to the study of such matrix elements for various potentials ( e.g.@xcite .",
    "we dealt with this problem along the lines described in the paper by @xcite .",
    "one can show that for any potential for which the asymptotic behavior of the continuous wave function is given by @xmath74 , the following result holds : @xmath75 here @xmath76 is a regular function and symbol @xmath77 has a usual meaning of the principal value integral .",
    "note that this divergence is present only when the velocity form ( as in the present paper ) or the length form are used for the electromagnetic interaction operator , it is absent if the acceleration form is used .",
    "presence of the singularity in the matrix elements in the velocity and length gauges is a consequence of the use of the spectral representation for the green function in ( [ ls4 ] ) and should disappear from the final result after the summation over the whole spectrum is carried out .",
    "a convenient way to deal with such integrals is to introduce a suitable regularization procedure .",
    "different procedures of this sort can be devised .",
    "we shall illustrate the use of the two simplest methods .",
    "the first regularization scheme consists in computing all the divergent integrals over some finite interval @xmath78 , hoping that final results depend only very weakly upon @xmath79 if its value is suitably chosen . that this is indeed so can be seen from the results for the level shift presented in ( [ tab0 ] ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ tm3 ] ) , this quantity is related to the real part of the diagonal matrix element of the @xmath35-operator .    to determine the shift we devised a simple iterative procedure , based on the eq .",
    "( [ tm3 ] ) . the linear system ( [ ls4 ] ) was solved with a trial value @xmath80 , than the value given by the r.h.s of the eq .",
    "( [ tm3 ] ) was adopted as a new trial value for @xmath39 , the procedure was repeated untill convergence was achieved . typically , three iterations were sufficient to achieve convergence on the level of a fraction of a percent .",
    "the results of a ( -4,4 ) calculation using this strategy are shown in the table [ tab0 ] .",
    "the calculation was performed for different values of the cutoff parameter @xmath79 .",
    "as one can see , the values for the level shift are fairly stable with respect to the variations of the regularization parameter @xmath79 .",
    "the stability of the results with @xmath79 becomes somewhat worse for very strong fields ( @xmath81  a.u . in the table [ tab0 ] ) .",
    "this , however , is to be expected as for such strong fields the ( -4,4 ) calculation is probably too small and a larger number of photons should be included to obtain more accurate results .",
    "results in the table [ tab0 ] should be compared with the plot illustrating the level shift as a function of the electric field strength from the time - dependent @xmath2-matrix calculation of @xcite . although the numerical values are not reported in this paper , a visual comparison of our data with the the plot quite satisfactory .",
