    "in the last years the study and knowledge of the full three - dimensional dynamical nucleon structure in polarized high energy collisions have witnessed impressive progress ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) . motivated by several experimental results on spin and azimuthal asymmetries , a class of partonic , transverse momentum dependent , distribution and fragmentation functions ( nowadays largely known as tmds for short ) have been introduced and analyzed . in high energy hadronic processes where two energy scales play a role ( a large perturbative scale and a small transverse momentum scale ) the usual leading - twist qcd",
    "collinear factorization schemes , making use of the corresponding collinear parton distribution ( pdfs ) and fragmentation ( ffs ) functions , often fail to describe several puzzling experimental measurements on spin asymmetries .",
    "when a small transverse scale is involved one needs to take care more accurately of the intrinsic motion of constituent partons inside parent hadrons .",
    "typical examples are : the low transverse momentum distribution of dilepton pairs in drell - yan ( dy ) processes and the corresponding asymmetries in the azimuthal distribution of the observed pair  @xcite ; the low transverse momentum spectrum of hadrons produced in the current region in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis )  @xcite ; the azimuthal asymmetries in the correlations of two leading hadrons ( typically pions ) observed in opposite jets produced in @xmath0 collisions  @xcite . despite the theoretical and experimental difficulties associated with the study of these reactions , they offer a unique opportunity to learn about the hadron structure in the transverse directions ( with respect to the usual light - cone one ) .    from an historical perspective",
    ", the first sizable single spin asymmetries were observed in single inclusive hadron production at large values of the feynman variable , @xmath2 , and moderately large transverse momentum in polarized hadronic collisions .",
    "however , the theoretical study of this process is made difficult by the fact that there is no small transverse momentum scale .",
    "intrinsic transverse momenta of partons are integrated out in the observable .",
    "this complicates the treatment of such ( higher twist ) asymmetry , since several possible effects are mixed up and it is not obvious how to disentangle them .",
    "moreover , a tmd factorization scheme similar to that developed for the reactions discussed above ( dy , sidis , @xmath0 annihilations ) has never been proved and , at least for double inclusive jet and/or hadron production processes , like the one studied here , there are clear indications that factorization may be broken ( for a recent discussion , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "quite recently , it has been suggested to study azimuthal asymmetries in hadronic collisions by looking at the azimuthal distribution of leading hadrons ( pions or kaons ) inside a large transverse momentum jet inclusively produced in polarized proton proton collisions  @xcite .",
    "although also in this case a proof of tmd factorization is not available ( if one takes into account intrinsic motion in the initial colliding hadrons ) , the observables considered are rather similar to those measured in sidis . in particular , leading - twist asymmetries appear and different contributions ( like the sivers or collins effects ) can be disentangled by taking appropriate moments of the azimuthal distributions , much in the same way adopted in the sidis or dy cases .",
    "the detailed analysis of this process can be of crucial relevance , when compared with analogous studies in the dy and sidis cases , for the theoretical and phenomenological understanding of the process dependence and the universality properties of the sivers distribution and the validation of the expected universality of the collins fragmentation function .",
    "other tmds can also be tested in the same way .    in this review",
    "we summarize recent results concerning the study of the sivers and collins azimuthal asymmetries in the distribution of leading pions inside a jet in @xmath3 processes .",
    "after a short description of the tmd theoretical approach adopted , the so - called generalized parton model ( gpm )  @xcite , we present a selection of interesting results involving the sivers and collins effects , that are expected to be the dominant contributions to the single spin asymmetries considered here",
    ".    we will also discuss in some details an extension of the gpm  @xcite , named colour gauge invariant ( cgi ) gpm , including colour gauge factors in the approach , and its application to the study of the process dependence of the sivers distribution  @xcite .",
    "this is indeed expected in perturbative qcd , due to the essential role played by initial and final state interactions among active partons and parent hadrons for the nonvanishing of these single - polarized observables .",
    "finally , we will shortly summarize other recent attempts to study the process dependence of the sivers distribution ( and other tmd pdfs and ffs ) in different processes and adopting different theoretical approaches .",
    "hopefully , the combined phenomenological analysis of several reactions and observables will help in clarifying essential theoretical issues crucial for a full understanding of these interesting phenomena in the realm of qcd .",

    "in fact , because of isospin invariance , the collins function for neutral pions is given by half the sum of the fragmentation functions for charged pions , hence turning out to be very small .",

    "extrapolation beyond @xmath103 , where transversity is not constrained , leads to completely different estimates at large @xmath102 , as shown in the figures .",
    "based on these considerations , in a recent paper  @xcite ( to which we refer for more details ) a different and complementary analysis ( denoted as  scan procedure \" ) has been performed .",

    "the study of the universality and process dependence of the sivers function is of relevance also in the context of the so - called  sign mismatch \" issue for the collinear twist - three approach  @xcite .",
    "since in this formalism factorization has been proven for both sidis processes and single inclusive particle production in hadronic collisions at large energy scales , the multi - parton soft correlation functions involved are universal and process independent . on the other hand , factorization holds also for the tmd approach in sidis , for large @xmath173 and small transverse momentum of the final hadron .",
    "it has been shown that there is a common region of validity of these two approaches , and this allows to find a relation among the twist - three quark - gluon correlation function and the first @xmath174 moment of the tmd sivers function . however ,",

    "however , one must not forget that the sivers effect is not the only possible contribution to @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , it may be that the sivers effect gives a subdominant contribution , and the asymmetry is mainly due to the collins effect in the fragmentation sector . to investigate this eventuality",
    "it is crucial to collect experimental information for processes like , e.g. , @xmath177 and @xmath178 where fragmentation in the final state is absent .",

    "gamberg , kang and prokudin  @xcite have performed a new fit of the sivers function using hermes and compass data on the @xmath180 asymmetry .",
    "then , using this information and the relation among the twist - three quark - gluon correlation function and the first @xmath174 moment of the sivers function discussed above , they have estimated the spin asymmetry for @xmath178 in the collinear twist - three approach , comparing it with a@xmath169dy data",
    ". they found , taking into account that the large @xmath115 behaviour of the sivers function is poorly constrained by present sidis data , that their estimate is consistent with experimental data and there is in fact no strong sign mismatch problem , contrary to the case of pion single spin asymmetries discussed above .",
    "kang and qiu  @xcite have proposed to probe the ( modified ) universality of the quark and gluon sivers functions , that is the change of sign between the sivers functions in sidis and dy processes , by studying the transverse single spin asymmetry @xmath79 for @xmath181 production and inclusive lepton production from @xmath181 decays in polarized proton - proton collisions at rhic energies .",
    "although the lepton asymmetry is diluted by the @xmath181 decays , its size can reach several percents over a large range of lepton rapidity at rhic .",
    "therefore this process can offer an additional phenomenological test of the predicted sign change of the sivers function .",
    "moreover , because of the weak interaction , it can provide unique information , with respect to the dy case , on the flavour dependence and the functional form of the sivers function .",
    "let us finally add some comments on the process dependence of the t - odd tmd fragmentation functions , like the collins function and the so - called  polarizing \" fragmentation function  @xcite .",
    "they have been shown to be universal by several authors , see e.g.  refs .",
    "testing phenomenologically universality in the fragmentation sector is as important as the tests for the modified universality of the sivers functions discussed above .",
    "however , for the collins function , the study of its universality is made difficult by its chiral - odd nature . in any physical observable",
    "it will always appear coupled to another chiral - odd object , either in the distribution or in the fragmentation sector . as well known examples , the collins function couples to the tmd transversity distribution in sidis and in the pion - jet production process considered in detail here .",
    "it couples to another collins ff in @xmath182 reactions .",
    "therefore , relative signs among these coupled chiral - odd functions are difficult to determine and require the study of different observables involving additional chiral - odd functions .    based on these considerations , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have suggested to study the universality of the polarizing fragmentation functions and test factorization by looking at the transverse polarization of @xmath183 hyperons in sidis processes and @xmath0 annihilations .",
    "they found that , despite the large uncertainties in these functions , definite signs for the hyperon polarization in different processes can be obtained , possibly allowing for a robust test of universality in this sector .",
    "in the last years , impressive progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of the origin of the sizable azimuthal and spin asymmetries measured by several experiments in polarized hadronic processes at large energy scales .",
    "the crucial role of colour gauge invariance , and of the proper account of gauge links ( wilson lines ) also in the transverse plane with respect to the usual light - cone direction , has been emphasized and investigated in depth .",
    "several processes and polarized observables , for which factorization may not hold and universality can be broken , have been recognized . however , it is always difficult to assess , for the ongoing experiments , as well as for the ones which are going to be performed in the near future , the real relevance and size of process - dependent terms and factorization - breaking effects . clearly , theoretical , more formal ,",
    "developments must be complemented by corresponding detailed phenomenological analyses .",
    "these can be of great help and valuable guidance for further theoretical progress in this field .    in this review",
    "we have discussed , in the framework of the so - called generalized parton model , the phenomenological relevance and usefulness of the reaction @xmath184 for the study of the process dependence of the tmd pdfs and ffs , in particular for the sivers distribution and the collins fragmentation function .",

    "<S> in this paper we briefly review the transverse momentum dependent generalized parton model and its application to the study of azimuthal asymmetries in the distribution of leading hadrons ( mainly pions ) inside large transverse momentum jets inclusively produced in polarized proton - proton collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we put particular emphasis on the phenomenological interest of these observables , in combination with similar asymmetries measured in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering , drell - yan processes and @xmath0 collisions , for the study of the universality properties of the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for rhic kinematics at center - of - mass energies @xmath1 and 500 gev , for central and mainly forward jet rapidities , in particular for the sivers distribution and the collins fragmentation function , that are believed to be responsible of many of the largest asymmetries measured in the last years . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss the case of inclusive jet production and recent phenomenological applications of other theoretical approaches , like the colour gauge invariant generalized parton model and the collinear twist - three approach , aiming at clarifying the issues of the universality and process dependence of transverse momentum dependent functions . </S>"
