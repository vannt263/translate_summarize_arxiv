    "if we apply a cluster analysis to data , it is highly unlikely that all variables relate to the same cluster structure .",
    "hence , it is sometimes beneficial to regard the true cluster structure of interest as lying in a low - dimensional subspace of the data . in these cases ,",
    "researchers often apply the following two - step procedure :    carry out principal component analysis ( pca ) and obtain the first few components .",
    "perform the usual @xmath0-means clustering for the principal scores on the first few principal components , which are obtained in step @xmath1 .",
    "this procedure is called  tandem clustering \" by arabie and hubert ( 1994 ) .",
    "several authors warn against the use of tandem clustering ( e.g. , arabie and hubert ( 1994 ) ; chang ( 1994 ) ; de soete and carroll ( 1994 ) ) .",
    "the first few principle components of pca do not necessarily reflect the cluster structure in data .",
    "thus , an appropriate clustering result might not be obtained using this procedure .    instead of a two - step procedure , such as tandem clustering ,",
    "some methods that perform cluster analysis and dimension reduction simultaneously have been proposed ( e.g. , de soete and carroll ( 1994 ) ; vichi and kiers ( 2001 ) ) . de soete and carroll ( 1994 ) proposed reduced @xmath0-means ( rkm ) clustering , which includes conventional @xmath0-means clustering as a special case . for given data points @xmath2 in @xmath3 , the fixed cluster number @xmath0 and the dimension number of subspace @xmath4 , the objective function of rkm clustering",
    "is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a @xmath9 column - wise orthonormal matrix , and @xmath10 represents the usual norm . under certain regularity conditions ,",
    "rkm clustering has strong consistency ( terada ( 2012 ) ) .",
    "however , when the data matrix @xmath11 has a full rank , i.e. , @xmath12 , rkm clustering may fail to find a subspace that reflects the cluster structure .",
    "indeed , rkm clustering has been applied to data composed of a total of @xmath13 independent variables ( figure @xmath14 ) , which consists of @xmath15 variables actually related to the cluster structure and @xmath16 noise variables .     variables . ]",

    "is given in figure @xmath17 .",
    ", where the black points represent misclassified objects . ]",
    "the results indicate that the low - dimensional subspace revealed does not reflect the actual cluster structure and that the clustering result is , in fact , incorrect .",
    "vichi and kiers ( 2001 ) pointed out the possibility of such problems with the rkm clustering method and proposed a new clustering method , called factorial @xmath0-means ( fkm ) clustering .",
    "for the given data points @xmath2 in @xmath3 , the number of clusters @xmath0 , and the number of dimensions of subspace @xmath18 , fkm clustering is defined by the minimization of the following loss function : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath8 is a @xmath9 column - wise orthonormal matrix . when the given data points @xmath2 are independently drawn from a population distribution @xmath21 , we can rewrite the fkm objective function as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the empirical measure of the data points @xmath2 in @xmath3 . for each set of cluster centers @xmath24 and each @xmath9 orthonormal matrix @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath25 by the strong law of large numbers ( slln ) . thus , besides @xmath0-means clustering and rkm clustering , the global minimizer of @xmath26 is also expected to converge almost surely to the global ones of @xmath27 , say the population global minimizers .    in this paper , we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of population global minimizers and then prove the strong consistency of fkm clustering under some regular conditions .",
    "the framework of the proof in this paper is based on ones of the proof of the strong consistency of @xmath0-means clustering ( pollard ( 1981 , 1982 ) ) and rkm clustering ( terada ( 2012 ) ) . in pollard ( 1981 )",
    ", the proof of strong consistency of @xmath0-means clustering takes an inductive form . on the other hand , the proof of strong consistency of fkm clustering",
    "does not take such form and prove the consistency of fkm under the milde condition , as with terada ( 2012 ) . in the proof of main theorem , first we also show that the optimal sample centres eventually lie in some compact regions on @xmath28 as with pollard ( 1981 ) and terada ( 2012 ) and then prove the conclusion of the theorem in the same manner of the last part of the proof of the consistency theorem in terada ( 2012 ) . for an arbitrary @xmath9 column - wise orthonormal matrix @xmath29 , an arbitrary @xmath30-dimensional point @xmath31 and an arbitrary @xmath18-dimensional point @xmath32 ,",
    "the key inequality in this paper is that @xmath33 while the key equation in the strong consistency of rkm clustering ( terada ( 2012 ) ) is that @xmath34 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath35",
    ", we describe the clustering algorithm of fkm to get the local minimum and the relationship between rkm clustering and fkm clustering .",

    "this algorithm monotonically decreases the fkm objective function and the solution of this algorithm will be at least a local minimum point .",
