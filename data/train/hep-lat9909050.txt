    "understanding sea quark effects in the light hadron spectrum is an important issue , sharpened by the recent finding of a systematic deviation of the quenched spectrum from experiment@xcite . to this end , we have been pursuing @xmath0 qcd simulations using an rg - improved gauge action and a tadpole - improved clover quark action  @xcite , to be called * rc *  simulations in this article .",
