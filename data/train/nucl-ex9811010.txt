    "hadronic dynamics have until recently been comprising of two non - overlapping domains , distinctly separated along the lines of their respective description of matter as hadronic or quark . on the low - energy side of the spectrum , matter is probed on a scale where pions and baryonic resonances are the relevant constituents .",
    "these have been rather succesfully employed by quasi - phenomenological models in providing prescriptions for free and in - medium hadronic interactions . at the higher - energy end , far above energies typical of baryonic resonances , quark degrees of freedom become accessible and matter tends asymptotically towards quark - gluon plasma . in this regime , described by perturbative qcd , quarks become deconfined and chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "although the origin of quark confinement is not known , it is evident that , whatever the reasons , it must induce spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the two phenomena are therefore linked and in the limit of chiral symmetry restoration , as quark masses tend to zero , vector - meson masses and widths are also expected to change @xcite .",
    "the transition from hadronic to quark matter and the effect of increasing density and temperature on the properties of light vector mesons have been addressed in the context of qcd sum rules @xcite as well as effective lagrangians @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a temperature and density dependent lowering of the @xmath0 mass is regarded as a precursor of the chiral phase transition , expected to be measurable even at normal nuclear density @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy region from hadronic phenomenology to the domain of perturbative qcd has come to the foreground , as the study of vector - meson property modifications in this range appears to be holding the key to understanding the mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration .    the recent advent of high duty - cycle photon beams , on one hand , and high - resolution dilepton spectrometers , on the other , have opened up the possibility of reconciliation between the hadronic and quark depictions of matter .",
    "hadronic probes coupled with hadron spectrometers had been extensively used in the past for energies up to the @xmath9 resonance , but higher - up , where multi - pion production channels increasingly dominate , the combination becomes rapidly cumbersome due to medium distortions from initial and final state interactions . for the study of the vector mesons that couple to multi - pion states",
    ", the photon is ideally suited .",
    "the recognition of the electromagnetic interaction as an indispensable probe at either the entrance or the exit channel , if the vector - meson field in the nuclear medium is to be delineated , has generated activity in a variety of fields .      at relativistic energies , under extreme conditions of temperature and density ,",
    "the quest for signs of a phase transition from hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma is at the heart of experimental programs using heavy - ion beams ( e.g. at cern , gsi , and rhic ) and dilepton spectrometers . a series of pioneering studies from the ceres , helios-3 , and na50 colaborations at sps / cern with central s + au , s + w , pb + au , and pb + pb collisions",
    ", have largely been interpreted as indicative of a downward shift of the @xmath0 mass in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass spectra for dilepton production that have been measured in these experiments , when compared with the respective p - a spectra , show a large enhancement at low invariant mass regions .",
    "the excess dileptons are thought to originate from the decay of mesonic resonances produced in @xmath3 annihilation and , in the mass region 0.2@xmath10m@xmath110.5 gev / c@xmath8 , the models advocating vector - meson medium modifications attribute the enhancement to the decay of the @xmath0 meson with a downward - shifted mass @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , an explanation in terms of conventional phenomenological @xmath0-meson medium modifications is also consistent with the cern data @xcite . in this more conservative approach ,",
    "the @xmath0 spectral function below 0.6 gev / c@xmath8 in dilepton invariant mass is appreciably enhanced from the contributions of `` rhosobar''-type excitations such as the @xmath12 , n@xmath13(1720)n@xmath14 and @xmath15 , a consequence of the strong coupling of the @xmath0 meson with @xmath3 states in the nuclear medium .",
    "this being the case , the downward shift of the @xmath0-meson mass in the nuclear medium may amount to no more than a convenient parametrization @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", a model combining chiral su(3 ) dynamics with vector - meson dominance in an effective lagrangian has shown that chiral restoration does not demand a drastic reduction of vector - meson masses in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the latter model , in qualitative agreement with the hadronic - phenomenological models @xcite , predicts a substantial enhancement of the @xmath0 spectral density below the nominal resonance mass , with only a marginal mass reduction .",
    "this result is tantamount to the @xmath0 dissolving in the medium .",
    "moreover , both an interpretation of the ceres data as the outcome of either medium - modified hadronic interactions , or interactions of dissociated quarks in the quark - gluon phase , yield remarkably consistent results in the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to the conjecture that both the hadronic and quark - gluon phases must be present @xcite .",
    "the latter conclusion is also drawn by a synthesis of the mass - scaling @xcite and hadronic - phenomenological @xcite models , leading to the prediction that dynamical - hadronic effects that are dominant up to about nuclear density , mainly via the highly - collective n@xmath13(1520)n@xmath14 state , gradually give way to @xmath0-meson mass scaling as the quark degrees of freedom become increasingly relevant . in the intermediate crossover region of `` duality ''",
    ", both the hadronic and quark - gluon phases of matter are expected to coexist @xcite . thus , although a consensus has been reached on the issue of coexistence of the hadronic and quark - gluon phases in the transition region roughly placed upwards from @xmath161  gev , the question remains as to the extent to which the nuclear medium induces modifications to the @xmath0 mass and width .",
    "other less directly related experimental conjectures of medium modifications of the @xmath0 mass have been deduced from an anomalous j/@xmath17 suppression , reported by the na50 collaboration for pb + pb collisions @xcite , enhanced k@xmath18-@xmath19 scattering cross sections @xcite , and an iucf experiment of polarized proton scattering on @xmath20si , though in the latter the medium renormalization of the @xmath0 mass required for agreement with the data is inconsistent for different observables measured in the same experiment @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the experimental results discussed so far are inconclusive with regard to the magnitude of the @xmath0-meson medium mass modification , and underline the limitations encountered in complex processes , where the probe interacts with nuclear matter via the strong interaction and the channel being investigated may not be disentangled from conventional medium effects .",
    "these difficulties are largely overcome with the use of photons which do not suffer from initial state interactions .",
    "the availability of high - flux photon beams , which have compensated for the low interaction cross sections with nuclear matter , complemented by wide - angle multi - particle spectrometers , have made possible a new generation of experiments . in the e@xmath211 gev region ,",
    "matter is probed at short distances @xmath41 fm , which is at the gateway of the energy range where vector - meson properties are expected to undergo modifications . in this domain ,",
    "baryons and mesons are still the relevant constituents for the description of matter , yet their quark content becomes increasingly manifest , a fact which is reflected in qcd - inspired phenomenological models @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is the best candidate among the light vector mesons @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 as a probe of medium modifications , since , due to its short lifetime and decay length ( 1.3 fm ) , a large portion of @xmath0 mesons produced on nuclei will decay in the medium .",
    "for effective measurements with the photon as probe in the 1 gev region , kinematically complete experiments are required , which in turn necessitate the use of high - duty - cycle tagged photon beams and large - acceptance multi - particle spectrometers .",
    "these requirements were met by the tagx detector @xcite at the institute for nuclear study ( ins ) , where the tagx collaboration has completed a series of experiments with the @xmath1(@xmath2,@xmath3)x reaction and a 10% duty - cycle tagged photon beam .",
    "first , a lower - energy experiment ( 380@xmath4e@xmath25700 mev ) measured the single- and double-@xmath9 contributions to @xmath3 production @xcite .",
    "having established these important non-@xmath0 dipion processes , the kinematics of the @xmath1(@xmath2,@xmath3)x reaction were investigated in the range 800@xmath4e@xmath251120 mev , aiming at the @xmath26 channel .",
    "both the coherent and quasifree @xmath0 photoproduction mechanisms are relevant in the energy region of interest . for a @xmath1 target ,",
    "the energy threshold for the former is e@xmath27 873 mev , whereas the 1.083  gev energy threshold of the elementary @xmath0 photoproduction reaction on a nucleon is lowered for the quasifree channel in the nuclear medium , as the fermi momentum of the struck nucleon may be utilized to bring the @xmath0 meson on shell .",
    "coherent photoproduction on nuclei is characterized by small four - momentum transfers , resulting in @xmath0 mesons which mostly decay outside of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the latter is , consequently , of limited utility in probing vector - meson medium modifications .",
    "in contrast , quasifree subthreshold photoproduction ( e@xmath28 1.083  gev ) on one hand warrants that the interaction took place in the interior of the nucleus , since the nucleon fermi momentum is required to produce the @xmath0 , and on the other produces slower @xmath0 mesons , more likely to also decay inside the nucleus .",
    "moreover , subthreshold photoproduction , whether the target nucleus remains bound in the final state ( exclusive channel ) or decomposes to its constituent nucleons ( breakup channel ) , may be correlated with either a nuclear mean - field or nucleonic medium effect on vector - meson properties ( section  [ sec : int ] ) . specifically , exclusive subthreshold photoproduction produces @xmath0 mesons which , on the average , traverse distances comparable to the size of the nucleus before their hadronic decay .",
    "this process is therefore a probe of vector - meson medium modifications at normal nuclear densities , a regime which has been the focus of mean - field driven theoretical models .",
    "the breakup channel , on the other hand , is more likely to produce @xmath0 s which are slower relative to the struck nucleon and may travel distances shorteer than the nucleonic radius before decaying ( section  [ sec : int ] ) .",
    "thus , large densities in the interior of the nucleon may become accessible via the breakup channel , amounting to a nucleonic medium effect .",
    "this is the realm of the emerging hadronic - quark nature of matter , a domain virtually unexplored . in the deep subthreshold region , and for large momentum transfers to the target nucleus , the coherent and exclusive - quasifree channels are suppressed , and the breakup - quasifree process becomes dominant .",
    "it is the subthreshold dynamics that motivated the 800@xmath4e@xmath251120 mev @xmath0 photoproduction experiment .",
    "the aim of the experiment being as stated above , the choice of @xmath1 as the target becomes almost ideal .",
    "the low photon energies utilized to induce subthreshold photoproduction result in slow @xmath0 mesons with a small lorentz boost , and therefore a large probability for decay within the nuclear volume .",
    "thus , in the case of the exclusive channel , a large nuclear radius is not necessary , and the larger nuclear density of a heavier target is predicted to have only a marginally enhanced effect on the @xmath0 meson mass @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the breakup process is dominated by the nucleonic field , the size of the target nucleus is irrelevant . finally , the @xmath1 target is the lightest nucleus where a nuclear medium effect may be discernible , without the complexity of overwhelming final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "the @xmath0 detection is further aided by the inherent selectivity of the tagx spectrometer ( section  [ sec : spec ] ) to coplanar @xmath3 processes @xcite .",
    "this is due to the limited out - of - plane acceptance of the spectrometer , which preferentially selects the @xmath26 channel , at the expense of two - step processes ( e.g. fsi ) and uncorrelated @xmath3 production at distinct reaction vertices , the latter accounting for the majority of non-@xmath0 background events ( section  [ sec : pcs ] ) .",
    "this favorable feature of the spectrometer promotes an otherwise small component of the total amplitude , namely the subthreshold breakup channel , to a sizeable experimental signal .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 meson in the nuclear medium was extracted from the dipion spectra of the 800@xmath4e@xmath251120 mev experiment with the aid of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the reported mass shift was far larger than the predictions of any mean - field driven model pertaining to the exclusive process for @xmath1 @xcite ; a calculation based on qhd assuming a deep scalar potential yielding a @xmath0-@xmath1 bound state , on the other hand , produced much better agreement@xcite .",
    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite led to a reanalysis of the lower - energy measurements @xcite including the @xmath26 channel , and allowing for @xmath0 production with a shifted mass .",
    "the outcome of this reanalysis was an even larger shift @xcite , possibly indicating a mechanism other than those previously considered",
    ". a nucleonic medium effect , as sketched earlier , may be consistent with a large @xmath0-mass reduction , although a theoretical model has yet to be fully developed @xcite . though more work is needed to firmly establish and better understand these results @xcite , the @xmath1(@xmath2,@xmath3)x experiment for photon energies in the range 800@xmath4e@xmath251120 mev constitutes the first direct measurement of the @xmath0 mass in the nuclear medium . in this report ,",
    "a new and more thorough analysis is presented , including the first direct evidence of the characteristic @xmath29 signature of the @xmath0 meson decay in the subthreshold region , as well as refinements in the simulations and fitting procedure , relative to the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , leading to higher confidence in the extraction of the in - medium @xmath0 mass .",

    "@xcite , the new straw drift chamber @xcite , and different aspects of the data - analysis procedure @xcite have all been described in detail elsewhere , where the reader is referred for a more extensive discussion . in this section , a brief overview of the experimental apparatus",
    "is provided , as it applies for the @xmath1(@xmath2,@xmath3)x measurements , stressing the elements that were either introduced for the first time in this experiment , or that are important for the data analysis .",
    "the photon beam is produced utilizing the 1.3 gev tokyo electron synchrotron .",
    "a series of innovative technical improvements led in 1987 to the upgrading of the photon beam to one of medium duty cycle . in the present experiment ,",
    "the endpoint electron energy e@xmath30 is 1.22 gev at an average 10% duty factor , corresponding to a 5 ms extraction time .",
    "the instantaneous energy of the extracted electrons has a sinusoidal dependence , and it is known by measuring the extraction time .",
    "the extracted electrons are directed via a beamline onto a thin platinum radiator where bremsstrahlung photons are produced , while the scattered electrons are bent away from the beam by a rectangular analyzer magnet of 1.17 t. the magnet settings of the extraction beamline vary sinusoidally in time , in phase with the e@xmath30 energy .",
    "an array of 32 scintillator electron - tagging counters , each with a 10 mev / c momentum acceptance , detect the scattered electrons .",
    "the position of the tagger registering the scattered electron determines its energy , and consequently that of the bremsstrahlung photon as e@xmath5 = e@xmath31 - e@xmath32 with @xmath9e@xmath335  mev accuracy .",
    "a second set of 8 backing taggers participates in the coincidence triggering signal , along with the 32 frontal ones , and is discussed in the following section .",
    "the tagged photon intensity was maintained at an average of @xmath163.5 @xmath34 10@xmath35 @xmath2/s , well within the tolerance of the data acquisition system for accidental triggers .",
    "the photons , distributed over a beam spot of @xmath162  cm in diameter , are subsequently incident on a liquid @xmath1 target .",
    "the target is at a temperature of 1.986@xmath70.001 k , corresponding to a 0.0786 g/@xmath36 density , and is contained in a cylindrical vessel 90 mm in height and 50 mm in diameter at the center of the tagx spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the tagger hits are related to the photon flux incident upon the target after efficiency corrections . in particular , due to the collimation of the photon beam downstream from the taggers , some of the tagged photons do not reach the target . to determine the tagging efficiency , and consequently the photon flux , a lead - glass @xmath37erenkov counter is placed in the photon beam , with reduced flux , downstream from the target and the tagger scalers",

    "( [ norm ] ) , in the empty - target background subtraction procedure applied to the measured spectra ( see section  iii ) .",
    "the tagx spectrometer has an acceptance of @xmath46 sr for charged particles ( neutral - particle detection was not utilized in the present experiment ) , and has been in use at ins since 1987 .",
    "it consists of several layers of detector elements ( fig .",
    "[ figtgx ] ) positioned radially outwards from the target vessel , which is located at the center of the 0.5  t field of a dipole analyzer magnet .    directly surrounding the target container is the inner hodoscope ( ih ) , made up of two sets of six scintillator counters , one on each side of the beam .",
    "the ih is used in the trigger , as well as in measuring the time of flight ( tof ) of the outgoing particles @xcite . as it is placed inside a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the light signal is carried by optical fibers to the photomultiplier tubes , which are located at the fringes of the magnetic field two meters away .",
    "next is the straw drift chamber ( sdc ) , operating since 1994 and installed expressly for the measurement of the @xmath0 mass in @xmath1 , with the objective of improving the momentum resolution for the detection of the @xmath26 decay channel @xcite .",
    "the sdc consists of two semi - circular cylindrical sections , each containing four layers of vertical cells .",
    "the `` straw '' cells have tube - shaped cathodes which induce a radial electric field , and consequently have a regular field definition and high position resolution ( @xmath16150  @xmath47 m ) .",
    "the sdc was designed to preserve the @xmath46-sr large acceptance prior to its installation , to not impose extensive modifications of the spectrometer , and to not induce significant energy losses to traversing particles by keeping its thickness to minimum .",
    "the installation of the sdc required , nonetheless , the replacement of the ih from an earlier set of scintillators with the one described above .    surrounding the sdc are two semicircular cylindrical drift chambers ( cdc ) subtending angles from 15@xmath48 to 165@xmath48 on both sides of the beamline in the horizontal plane , and @xmath718.3@xmath48 in vertical out - of - plane angles .",
    "the cdc is composed of twelve concentric layers of drift cells , yielding a @xmath16250 - 300  @xmath47 m horizontal and @xmath49  cm vertical resolution .",
    "together with the sdc , they are used to determine the planar momentum and emission angle of the charged particles traversing them , and the vertex position of trajectory crossings .",
    "the outer set of 33 scintillator elements comes next , serving as the outer hodoscope ( oh ) , with pmt s attached at both ends to help determine the track angle relative to the median plane .",
    "the two sets of hodoscopes , ih and oh , measure the tof corresponding to the tracked trajectories .",
    "other components of the tagx spectrometer include 4 sets of 155  mm  @xmath34  50  mm  @xmath34  5  mm @xmath50 background veto counters positioned along the oh arms in the median plane .",
    "the veto counters eliminate charged - particle tracks registering within @xmath51 2.5 mm , mostly affecting forward - focused @xmath50 pairs produced copiously downstream from the target , but having a small effect on @xmath3 events .",
    "the channel of interest being @xmath3 production from the decay of the @xmath0 meson , two - charged particle coincidences on opposite sides of the beam axis were required of the trigger .",
    "two levels of triggering are implemented in order to optimize the data acquisition electronics .",
    "the pretrigger @xmath52 is generated within 100  ns from the occurence of an event .",
    "a coincidence of a left and right ih hit with a backing tagger hit is required , and not rejected by the forward @xmath50 veto counters .",
    "the main trigger @xmath53 requires the coincidence of the pretrigger with a left and right oh hit and a forward tagger hit , not rejected by the computer inhibit signal .",
    "a window of 400  ns is available between the @xmath54 and the @xmath55 , after which the camac is cleared for the next @xmath56 .",
    "typical counting rates are 2  khz and 30  hz for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .    the calibration of the scintillation counters and the cdc and sdc have been the subject of extensive effort @xcite .",
    "more recently , a series of modifications implemented in the track fitting algorithms has resulted in significant improvements , mainly in the planar - momentum resolution @xcite .",
    "it is the tracking that is discussed next .",
    "the cdc consists of four groups of three - wire layers ( fig .",
    "[ figtgx ] ) .",
    "the last layer of wires for each group was intended for charge division readout and had not been employed in the past @xcite .",
    "instead , hits from the eight remaining cdc layers were used for the reconstruction of the planar momentum @xmath57 , emission angle @xmath58 , and vertex position ( see also section  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "this earlier eight - layer tracking procedure did not incorporate the sdc information either , thus resulting altogether in a less - than - optimal momentum resolution .",
    "since longer effective lengths of reconstructed tracks result in higher - quality fits , however , tdcs from the last layer of wires of the fourth group has been implemented for the first time in the present analysis .",
    "furthermore , the sdc data have also been used for the first time , a combination which yields an overall improvement in the planar momentum resolution estimated to be @xmath59/p@xmath60 = 0.0892p@xmath60 + 0.0057 , compared with @xmath59/p@xmath60 = 0.1150p@xmath60 + 0.0078 from the 8-layer cdc analysis @xcite .",
    "for a particle of p@xmath60=300  mev / c , this amounts to a 40% improvement in the planar momentum resolution .",
    "the corresponding improvement in the vertex position is reflected in fig .",
    "[ figsdc ] , and has allowed for more stringent tests in the selection of two - track events which originate from the target area .",
    "a minor improvement has also been noted in the emission angle resolution , which stays relatively constant at @xmath61  0.3@xmath48 throughout the range of typical planar momenta 100 mev / c @xmath4 p@xmath62  500  mev / c @xcite .",
    "the steps involved in the tracking of trajectories through the sdc and cdc may be summarized in the following : the cdc tdcs operate in `` common - stop '' mode , with the start determined from each cdc sense wire and the stop from the ih @xcite .",
    "the cdc drift times are first corrected by the corresponding tdc timing offsets .",
    "the drift - length to drift - time relation is determined next , per layer of cdc wires , as a fifth - order polynomial .",
    "this is an iterative process , where an initial set of parameters is used to reconstruct a sample of well - defined high - momentum tracks .",
    "the reconstructed trajectories yield a new set of parameters , and the procedure is repeated until the convergence condition is reached , namely that the residual root mean square ( rrms ) improvement over the final two cycles is no better than 0.5% .",
    "once a cdc track has been reconstructed , a similar procedure is followed for the sdc , where first the tdc timing offset is determined , and subsequently a sdc length - to - time relationship is extracted .",
    "this accomplished , `` best '' sdc tracks are identified , which qualify as candidate extensions of a selected cdc track . typically , 2 - 4 sdc tracks are selected as possible extensions of a reconstructed cdc track when all four sdc layers have registered a hit , to a maximum of 8 candidate tracks if one sdc layer is missed .",
    "the sdc tracks are approximated by straight - line segments , since the error in the position of even the slowest particles which may be expected to result in valid two - track events is within the 150  @xmath63 m tolerance of the sdc .",
    "finally , the sdc candidates are matched with the cdc reconstructed track , by requiring the minimal cdc + sdc rrms of the combined track .",
    "the obtained tof resolution @xmath64 is better than 380  ps @xcite .",
    "the tof is used for particle identification , as well as for the determination of the particles oh position ( along the @xmath65-axis in the tagx frame as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtgx ] ) .",
    "the data presented in this report were collected in two periods , with @xmath1 and empty - target measurements in each .",
    "the superior quality of the photon beam , and a longer running period , resulted in better statistics and a higher ratio of @xmath3 to accidental triggers for the second phase .",
    "this is reflected in the tagger efficiencies and radiator out / in ratios , defined in eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) , which during the later part of the experiment were generally improved .",
    "a total of 16,366 @xmath3 events have been identified from the analysis of two - track events , comprising 73% of the total number of reconstructed events , the remaining being of three ( 23% ) or more tracks ( @xmath104% ) . with the extraction of the @xmath3 yield y ,",
    "the total cross section @xmath66 is determined from the relation @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( nuclei / cm@xmath8 ) is the @xmath1 target density seen by the photon beam , and @xmath70 is the incident photon flux . the efficiencies @xmath71 and @xmath72 account for the data - acquisition livetime and @xmath3 detection efficiencies .",
    "the latter , which is in the range of 2.7 - 6.8% for the @xmath0 channels , is determined by dedicated mc routines and is reaction - channel specific ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      in section  [ sec : pb ] , the extraction of the tagger efficiencies , and the normalization of the tagger scalers to reflect the number of photons incident on the target , were discussed .",
    "these are utilized in determining the appropriate factor by which empty - target spectra are scaled prior to their subtraction from the corresponding @xmath1-target spectra , for the removal of target background counts .",
    "the procedure is briefly summarized in the following steps .    at regular intervals throughout each of the @xmath1-target and empty - target running periods ,",
    "the lead - glass @xmath37erenkov counter is employed in dedicated reference runs to determine the quantities @xmath43 and @xmath73 , as described in section  [ sec : pb ] .",

    ".  @xcite it was determined that dividing the data sample in @xmath118 = 80 mev bins provided the optimal compromise between the presumed constancy of the reaction matrix elements , implicit in the mc simulations which only depend on the kinematics , and the requirement of sufficient statistics .",
    "the @xmath119 partitioning of the data is necessary in order to account for the varying energy dependence of the @xmath3 cross sections from each of the individual production mechanisms .",
    "the 80  mev binning in e@xmath5 has been retained , resulting in four sectors of the data sample from 800 to 1120 mev , to be referred by their respective central e@xmath5 values ( 840 , 920 , 1000 , and 1080 @xmath740  mev ) .",

    "[ figacc ] ) .    the combination of improvements relative to the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , accounting for the angular momentum in the @xmath9 and @xmath0 channels , and imposing additional physical constraints via the new kinematical observable cos@xmath89 , resulted in a more accurate treatment of the process - dependent spectrometer acceptances .",
    "the data have been subjected to two additional cuts , one of which enhances the @xmath0 relative to the background channels , and the other facilitates the separation of the bound @xmath125 from the breakup @xmath96 final states .",
    "the former is a @xmath3 opening - angle cut determined from mc simulations , namely 70@xmath126 180@xmath48 , eliminating two - pion events that could not have been produced back - to - back from the @xmath0 decay ( fig .",
    "[ figcuts]a ) .",
    "this cut is most effective at the higher end of photon energies covered by the experiment , where the @xmath0 identification becomes difficult by an increasingly deteriorating @xmath0-to - background ratio with increasing e@xmath5 .",
    "the latter cut ( fig .  [ figcuts]b ) separates events with missing mass in the proximity of the target mass @xmath127 ( i.e. @xmath128 ) , from those associated with the breakup of the target nucleus to @xmath96 in the final state ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the combination of the two types of cuts is applied to three of the kinematical observables , resulting in six additional spectra , besides the unselected @xmath3 distributions 1 - 6 enumerated earlier .",
    "these are : @xmath130    while the contributing @xmath0 photoproduction mechanisms may not be experimentally distinguishable ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) , the cuts aim at partitioning the data in biased samples favoring processes which are more prone to probing either the nuclear mean - field effect ( i.e. coherent and exclusive quasifree photoproduction via the distributions 7 - 9 ) , or a possible nucleonic effect ( i.e. the breakup quasifree channel via the spectra 10 - 12 ) .",
    "the three kinematical observables which were subjected to the cuts , namely , the dipion invariant mass , missing momentum , and dipion - cm @xmath86 production - angle , were selected empirically from the kinematical observables 1 - 6 as more sensitive to the @xmath0 mass , and therefore more susceptible to possible medium effects .    with a range of m@xmath6 values , traversing the region 500 - 725 mev / c@xmath8 , and each value kept common for the unselected , as well as the @xmath125 and @xmath96 selected data , the twelve simulated spectra were fitted simultaneously to the corresponding experimental ones , by minimizing a standard @xmath131 function with the strengths of the eleven individual processes @xmath132 ( section  [ sec : pcs ] ) as the fit parameters .",
    "the four @xmath9e@xmath133  mev bins were fitted independently .",
    "the optimal m@xmath6 for each bin is that corresponding to the minimum value of the @xmath131 function ( section  [ sec : mmm ] ) .    in summary",
    ", the mc fitting procedure satisfies the following requirements :    * the @xmath9e@xmath5 = 80 mev binning restricts the energy dependence of the participating processes to the narrowest bin possible without loss of sufficient statistics . * the six kinematical observables utilized in the fitting are complementary , and account for different physical attributes of the data sample .",
    "this imposes far more stringent constraints than an analysis based on only the invariant mass distribution , as in the case of the ceres data @xcite . *",
    "the simultaneous fitting of selected and unselected data aims at isolating a strong signal from data samples most responsive to possible @xmath0 mass modifications , while also incorporating in the fit the bulk of @xmath3 events produced in processes less sensitive to such effects .",
    "the outcome of this procedure is the medium - modified @xmath0 meson mass .",
    "beyond the statistical and other experimental uncertainties which are folded into the calibration and analysis of the measured @xmath3 yields , additional sources of uncertainty are generated by the mc simulations and fitting algorithm .",
    "i ) the mc event generators depend exclusively on kinematical parameters , neglecting other aspects of the interaction . as an example , the channel @xmath134 is modelled as @xmath135 , normalized by an isospin scaling factor to account for the remaining hadronic charge states .",
    "this introduces an uncertainty in the amplitude of this process , similar to which are also present in other background hadronic channels .",
    "ii ) independent total cross - section measurements of the constituent reactions , serving to anchor their relative strengths in the full @xmath3 production process , are sparse ( e.g. the quasi - elastic @xmath93 channel ) .",
    "the strength for some of the individual channels was inferred from indirect sources .",
    "iii ) additional quasifree channels and independent measurements to fix their strength are required in order to extract precision cross sections for the background hadronic channels from the data , processes which merit attention on their own behalf .",
    "this may become possible following the analysis of three charged - particle events from tagx experiments , currently in progress .    despite the caveats above",
    ", the medium - modified @xmath0 masses extracted from the mc fitting procedure have remained remarkably stable with respect to variations of the strength parameters of the constituent reactions , within each of the four @xmath118 bins .",

    "the absence of a conclusive @xmath0 mass - modification dependence from the 1000 and 1080 mev bins , in contrast to the strong signal from the 840 and 920 mev bins , is telling as well . whereas the former are more prone to probing the exclusive channel , and therefore the nuclear mean - field medium effect , the latter are deeper into the subthreshold region , dominated by the breakup channel , and probe distances shorter than the nucleonic radius . to illustrate the range of the @xmath0 processes in different energy regions , we consider the mean decay length @xmath142 of the @xmath0 @xmath143 with the nominal mass @xmath144 and width @xmath141 for the @xmath0 meson , in the rest frame of either the interacting nucleon , or the @xmath125 nucleus , for the breakup or bound final state ( fig .",
    "[ figdl0 ] ) . at low photon energies ( e.g. e@xmath5=840 mev ,",
    "[ figdl0]a ) the @xmath96 channel dominates @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "this is verified by the fact that the low missing - mass selected data represent less than 10% of the total unselected events , whereas the high missing - mass selected data contribute the great majority of the @xmath0 events and their corresponding distributions are generally consistent with the full ( unselected ) data . with the @xmath0 mesons produced on the nucleon , and a mean decay length of under @xmath145 fm for a substantial portion of them",
    ", there is a large overlap of the volume traversed before their decay and the nucleonic volume . to the extent that the medium modifications of the vector - meson properties depend on the density of the surrounding nuclear matter , it is conceivable that the induced medium effect be dominated by the large densities encountered in the interior of the nucleon , and consequently be far more pronounced than a medium effect induced by nuclear fringe densities . at higher photon energies ( e.g. e@xmath5=1 gev , fig .",
    "[ figdl0]b ) , both the @xmath96 and @xmath125 final states contribute and the mean decay length increases .",
    "whereas nucleonic densities become increasingly inaccessible , a large overlap of the volume traversed by the @xmath0 before its decay with the @xmath125 nucleus may still induce a weaker nuclear medium effect .",
    "moreover , the possibility of a medium - induced increase in the width @xmath141 is in favor of shorter decay lengths ( eq .  [ dl0 ] ) , and therefore further increases the likelihood of accessing regions of large densities either in the nucleon , or the nuclear core",
    ". the present results may therefore be suggestive of a moderate medium effect in the realm of the nuclear mean field at near - threshold photon energies , probing normal nuclear densities , turning to a drastic reduction of the @xmath0 mass in the deep subthreshold region , where the @xmath0 decay may be induced in the proximity of the nucleon .",
    "these implications , however , need to be further investigated and verified by higher precision and large solid angle experiments @xcite .",
    "in summary , the kinematics and final state of the @xmath1(@xmath2,@xmath3)x reaction have been studied with the tagx spectrometer and a tagged photon beam in the subthreshold @xmath0 photoproduction region .",
    "the bound @xmath146e and breakup @xmath96 components of the @xmath0 channel have been investigated , aiming at the distinction between a nuclear and a possible nucleonic medium effect on the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the @xmath0 channel has been aided by the inherent selectivity of the tagx spectrometer to coplanar @xmath3 events , and by the choice of @xmath1 as a target with minimal fsi effects without suppression of the @xmath0 amplitude . in any case",
    ", the size of target has little effect in the subthreshold region .",
    "the @xmath90 fingerprint of the @xmath0 has been observed in the dipion invariant mass region 500 - 700 mev / c@xmath8 , pointing to a substantial reduction beyond a trivial phase - space governed apparent lowering .",
    "this has been verified by mc simulations , incorporating the exclusive and breakup @xmath0 channels , the latter both with and without fsi , as well as background hadronic channels and s - wave correlations .",
    "the extracted @xmath0 medium - modified masses , 642@xmath740 mev / c@xmath8 , 669@xmath732 mev / c@xmath8 , and 682@xmath756 mev / c@xmath8 for the 840 , 920 , and 1000 mev data bins , suggest a strong medium effect in the deep subthreshold region , requiring large densities that are incompatible with a nucleus as light as @xmath125 , but that are more consistent with the probing of the nucleonic volume . the pattern of decreasing sensitivity with increasing photon energy , with the 1080 mev bin showing no evidence of a @xmath0 mass - modification signal , hints a moderate mean - field nuclear effect at near - threshold energies",
    ". the simulations are inconclusive regarding a medium - modified @xmath0 width .",
    "further analysis currently in progress for photoproduction on heavier targets ( @xmath147,@xmath148 ) and for background contributions ( e.g. the @xmath149 channel ) from tagx experiments , as well as future experiments planned for tjnaf @xcite , may more accurately isolate the @xmath26 channel from the background processes , and shed light on the nature of the medium modifications on light vector - meson properties at the interface of hadronic and quark matter .    the authors wish to thank h. okuno and the staff of ins - es for their considerable help with the experiment .",
    "furthermore , the authors acknowledge the very insightful discussions with p. guichon , m. ericson , a. thomas , and a. williams during the workshop on hadrons in dense matter ( adelaide , march 10 - 28 , 1997 ) , as well as the discussions with n. isgur at jefferson lab . this work has been partially supported by grants from ins - es , infn / lecce , nserc , and uff / gwu .",
