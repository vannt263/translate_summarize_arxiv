    "x - ray observations of clusters of galaxies show that in the central regions of most clusters the cooling time of the intracluster medium ( icm ) is significantly less than the hubble time ( edge , stewart & fabian 1992 ) .",
    "the observed cooling , which takes place primarily through the emission of x - rays , leads to a slow net inflow of material towards the cluster centre ; a process known as a _ cooling flow _ ( fabian 1994 ) .    within the idealized model of an _ homogeneous _ cooling flow ,",
    "all of the cooling gas flows to the centre of the cluster where it is deposited , having radiated away its thermal energy .",
    "however , observations of cooling flows show that the simple homogeneous model is not correct .",
    "although the x - ray surface brightness profiles of clusters with cooling flows are substantially more sharply - peaked than those of non cooling - flow systems , the emission is not as sharply - peaked as it would be in the case of homogeneous flows . rather than all of the cooling gas flowing to the very centres of the clusters ,",
    "the x - ray data show that gas is ` cooling out ' throughout the central few tens to hundreds of kpc .",
    "typically the cooled material is deposited with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the integrated mass deposition rate within radius @xmath7 .",
    "the x - ray data firmly require that cooling flows are _ inhomogeneous _ with a range of density and temperature phases at all radii .",
    "spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy of clusters also confirms the the presence of distributed cool ( and rapidly cooling ) gas in cooling flows .",
    "the spatial distribution and luminosity of the cool components determined from the spectral data are well - matched to values inferred from the x - ray images ( allen 1993 , allen , fabian & kneib 1996 ; fabian 1996 ; allen & fabian 1996 ) . for a detailed review of the theory and observations of cooling flows",
    "see fabian ( 1994 ) .    in this paper we present observations , made with the asca and rosat x - ray astronomy satellites , of three exceptionally luminous cluster cooling flows .",
    "two of the systems , zwicky 3146 ( @xmath0 ) and abell 1835 ( @xmath1 ) were identified as x - ray luminous clusters during optical - follow up studies to the rosat all - sky survey ( allen 1992a ) .",
    "the third system , e1455 + 223 ( or zwicky 7160 ; @xmath2 ) was identified by mason ( 1981 ) in a follow - up to x - ray observations made with einstein observatory .",
    "all three clusters are included in the rosat brightest cluster sample ( ebeling 1996a ) .    combining the high spectral resolution asca data with rosat images we present consistent determinations of the temperatures , metallicities , luminosities and cooling rates in the clusters .",
    "the data for zwicky 3146 , abell 1835 and e1455 + 223 identify them as the three largest cluster cooling flows known to date .",
    "we constrain the level of intrinsic x - ray absorption in the cooling flows and relate the results to measurements of intrinsic reddening in the central cluster galaxies ( ccgs ) of the systems .",
    "results on the distributions of x - ray gas , galaxies , and the total gravitating matter in the clusters are reported .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the observations . in section 3",
    "we present the x - ray and optical imaging data and discuss the morphological relationships between the clusters and their ccgs . in section 4",
    "we discuss the spectral analysis of the x - ray data . in section 5 present the results from the deprojection analyses of the rosat images .",
    "section 6 discusses the optical properties of the clusters . in section 7",
    "we discuss some of the more important results in detail , and in section 8 summarize our conclusions . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath8=50 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "0.2truein    0.2truein    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one of the most important results from this paper is the marked difference in the temperatures of the clusters determined from the single - phase and multiphase spectral models .",
    "these results are summarized in table 13 .",
    "the single - phase temperatures consistently ( and significantly ) underestimate the multiphase results . for zwicky 3146 and abell 1835",
    ", the asca single - phase results underestimate the multiphase temperatures by @xmath11 and 25 per cent , respectively . with the rosat data , the discrepancy in much more severe , with the pspc values underestimating the asca multiphase results by @xmath12 kev ( 50 per cent ) for zwicky 3146 , and @xmath13 kev ( 60 per cent ) for abell 1835 .",
    "note , however , that in all cases the reduced @xmath14 values indicate statistically acceptable fits .",
    "the multiphase @xmath15 results ( models c , d ) should approximate the true mass - weighted temperatures in the clusters ( thomas 1987 ; waxman & miralda - escude 1995 ; allen 1996 ) .",
    "the single - phase results , however , are simply emission / detector - weighted average values for the integrated cluster emission .",
    "since the x - ray emissivity of cluster gas rises with increasing density ( decreasing temperature ) , the presence of a large cooling flow naturally leads to a decrease in the emission - weighted temperature of a cluster .",
    "the effects on the emission - weighted @xmath15 are most dramatic in the @xmath16 kev band of the pspc , where the emission from cooler gas phases dominates the detected flux . however , the ( comparatively ) poor spectral resolution and limited band - pass of the pspc , mean that the single - phase models can still provide a statistically adequate description of the data .",
    "the pspc data are unable to discern the need for multi - temperature components ( although the imaging data clearly require them ) .",
    "these results imply that caution should be applied in the interpretation of temperatures determined with simple , single - phase models and , in particular , those determined from rosat data . with asca data the single - phase results should be more reliable , although significant discrepancies can still arise ( as in the case of abell 1835 ) .    the presence of a range of density and temperature phases is clearly established by the data for cooling flow clusters .",
    "however , it should not assumed that the absence of a cooling flow implies that a single - phase modelling of the icm is appropriate .",
    "the existence of cooling flows with distributed mass deposition requires significant inhomogeneity ( a density / temperature spread of @xmath17 a factor 2 ) in the ambient cluster gas before the cooling flow forms ( nulsen 1986 ; thomas , fabian & nulsen 1987 ) .",
    "the best data for clusters are consistent with such a range of inhomogeneity ( allen 1992b ) .",
    "the absence of cooling flows in some nearby , luminous clusters such as the coma cluster is usually attributed to merger events having disrupted the cluster cores and having re - heated and redistributed the cooling gas throughout the cluster .",
    "in such circumstances it seems unlikely that the merger will completely homogenize the gas and , therefore , that a single - phase model will provide an exact measure of the mass - weighted cluster temperature .",
    "12.5 cm    in fig .",
    "13 we show the palomar u band image of the central 2.5 arcmin@xmath18 of abell 1835 .",
    "the ccg is the bright source in the centre of the field .",
    "the image shows a number of distorted features ( arcs , arclets and image pairs ) attributable to gravitational lensing by the cluster . in particular , we observe a bright , elongated arc ( ` a ' in fig .",
    "13 ) at a radius of 30.3 arcsec from the centre of the ccg , along a pa of 133 degree .",
    "the arc has a length of @xmath19 arcsec , is extended along a pa of 221 degree , and exhibits reflection symmetry about the point @xmath20 , @xmath21 .    for a simple ,",
    "circular mass distribution the projected mass within the tangential critical radius , @xmath22 , is given by    @xmath23    where @xmath22 can be approximated by the arc radius ( @xmath24 kpc ) and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the angular diameter distances from the observer to the cluster , the observer to the lensed object , and the cluster to the lensed object . in fig .",
    "14 we show the mass within arc ` a ' as a function of the redshift of the arc , calculated with the above formula . also shown",
    "are the x - ray constraints on the projected mass within this radius [ @xmath28 @xmath29  from the multiphase analysis using spectral model c , and @xmath30 @xmath31  using spectral model d ] . combining the x - ray and lensing mass results we are able constrain the redshift of arc ` a ' to be @xmath32 .",
    "it is also important to note that if the single - phase ( model b ) x - ray temperature results for abell 1835 were ( wrongly ) used in place of the multiphase values , no consistent solution for the x - ray and lensing masses would be possible .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticity of the lensing potential may lead to a slight ( @xmath33 per cent ) overestimate of the lensing mass determined with the circular mass model ( bartlemann 1995 ) .",
    "however , the effects of ellipticity also lead to a slight overestimate of the x - ray mass within this aperture and , to first order , the conclusions on the redshift of the arc should not be dramatically affected .",
    "[ the lensing properties of abell 1835 , and those of a larger sample of x - ray luminous clusters observed with the palomar 5 m telescope , are discussed further by edge ( 1996 ) . ]    smail ( 1995 ) report results from a study of ( weakly ) gravitationally distorted images in the field of e1455 + 223 , from which they derive a projected mass within 450 kpc of the cluster centre of @xmath34 .",
    "this mass exceeds the x - ray determination of the projected mass within this radius , @xmath35  ( for an isothermal mass distribution corresponding to a temperature of 5.4 kev ) , by a factor @xmath36 .",
    "[ note that the determination of the x - ray mass assumes that the cluster remains isothermal and extends to 3mpc .",
    "however , extrapolating the mass profile to 5 mpc increases the projected mass within 450 kpc of the cluster centre by only @xmath37 per cent . ] using a potential consistent with the upper - limit to the x - ray temperature of 7.6 kev ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 kpc ) we still determine a projected mass within 450 kpc of only @xmath40 .",
    "the lensing result on the cluster mass for e1455 + 223 appears high .",
    "e1455 + 223 is a regular , relaxed cluster with a large cooling flow , and a @xmath41 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath42 .",
    "the asca constraints on the x - ray temperature ( @xmath43 kev ) are consistent with results for other nearby , cooling - flow clusters of similar x - ray luminosity ( abell 1795 ; edge 1990 , fabian 1996 ) , which lends support to the x - ray mass determination .",
    "the velocity dispersion of @xmath44 ( table 11 ) implied by the x - ray data is also in good agreement with optical observations ( @xmath45 ; mason 1981 , smail 1995 ) .    a cluster of exceptional x - ray luminosity and temperature is required to provide a projected mass within 450 kpc consistent with the smail ( 1995 ) result for e1455 + 223 .",
    "abell 1835 , discussed in this paper , provides a mass of @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , the exceptionally x - ray luminous cooling - flow cluster pks0745 - 191 ( @xmath47 ) , for which allen ( 1996 ) present a self - consistent determination of the mass distribution from x - ray and gravitational lensing data , provides a projected mass within 450 kpc of only @xmath48 .",
    "given the x - ray luminosity of e1455 + 223 ( which is a factor 2 - 3 less than pks0745 - 191 or abell 1835 ) , the x - ray mass measurement for the cluster seems reasonable and the lensing mass high .",
    "the result of smail ( 1995 ) may imply an unusual redshift distribution for the weakly distorted sources , or a projected mass distribution that deviates significantly from the simple isothermal mass model used ( perhaps due to some line of sight mass enhancement from material external to the x - ray luminous part of the cluster ) .",
    "ccgs in cooling flows frequently exhibit characteristic low - ionization , optical emission - line spectra ( johnstone , fabian & nulsen 1987 ; heckman 1989 ; crawford & fabian 1992 ; allen 1995 ) .",
    "the optical ( h@xmath49 ) line luminosity correlates with the excess uv / blue continuum luminosity ( the excess with respect to the uv / blue emission expected from a normal ge / cd galaxy ; johnstone , fabian & nulsen 1987 ; mcnamara & oconnell 1989 ; allen 1992a ; crawford 1995 ; allen 1995 ) .",
    "typically , both the emission lines and the excess uv / blue continua are extended across the central @xmath50 kpc of the clusters .",
    "the clusters discussed in this paper contain three of the largest cooling flows known .",
    "they also host three of the most optically line - luminous ( and uv / blue luminous ) ccgs .",
    "only the ccg of the massive cooling flow cluster pks0745 - 191 exhibits a comparable optical line luminosity ( allen 1996 ) .",
    "although no simple correlation between @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the optical line luminosity ( and therefore uv / blue continuum luminosity ) exists , the data presented here confirm a tendency for the most optically - line - luminous ccgs to be found in the largest cooling flows ( allen 1995 ) .",
    "the uv / blue continua in abell 1835 and zwicky 3146 appear dominated by emission from hot , massive stars ( allen 1995 ) .",
    "these young stellar populations may also provide the bulk of the ionizing continuum emission responsible for the observed optical emission lines .",
    "the exceptionally high mass deposition rates from the cooling flows in the clusters can naturally provide the large reservoirs of cooled material necessary to fuel the observed ( very high ) star formation rates ( allen 1995 ) . the star formation may also account for some of the dust in the ccgs .",
    "the excellent alignments between the ( optical ) ccg and ( x - ray ) cluster isophotes are consistent with the results for other massive cooling flows at intermediate ( @xmath53 ) redshifts ( allen 1995 ) .",
    "these results again reveal the unique and intimate link between ccgs and their host clusters .",
    "we have presented detailed results on the x - ray properties of zwicky 3146 , abell 1835 and e1455 + 223 , three of the most distant , x - ray luminous clusters known .",
    "we have shown that these clusters contain the three largest cooling flows known , with mass deposition rates of @xmath3 and 1500 , respectively .",
    "we have presented mass models for the clusters and have highlighted the need for multiphase analyses to consistently explain the spectral and imaging x - ray data for these systems .",
    "the inappropriate use of single - phase models leads to significant underestimates of the cluster temperatures and masses . for abell 1835",
    "it was shown that a mass distribution that can consistently explain both the x - ray and gravitational lensing data for the cluster can only be formed when multiphase x - ray spectral models are used .",
    "we have discussed the relationship between intrinsic x - ray absorption and optical reddening in the clusters .",
    "these results suggest that the x - ray absorbing material frequently observed in the x - ray spectra of cooling flows is dusty .",
