    "it has been a decade since bose einstein condensation ( bec ) in atomic vapors was first observed @xcite .",
    "the transition from a classical thermal gas to the quantum degenerate bose - einstein condensate occurs when the occupation number of the lowest energy states ( phase space density ) @xmath2 is increased to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number density and @xmath5 is the thermal de broglie wavelength of the atoms .",
    "so in principle , getting a bec is easy : you simply cool down the gas until the critical phase space density is reached . in practice ,",
    "the procedure is more complicated .",
    "a variety of different techniques are needed to increase the phase space density in several stages ( table [ tablepsd ] ) .",
    "furthermore , each atom has different properties and requires modifications to the cooling techniques .",
    "major work by many groups around the world has now extended the cooling techniques to an impressive number of atomic species : @xmath1rb @xcite , @xmath0na @xcite , @xmath6li @xcite , @xmath7h @xcite , @xmath8rb @xcite , @xmath9he * @xcite , @xmath10k @xcite , @xmath11cs @xcite , @xmath12yb @xcite , and @xmath13cr @xcite .",
    "still , @xmath0na and @xmath1rb are the two atoms which appear to have the most favorable properties for laser and evaporative cooling and are the two work horses in the field ."

    "<S> a high flux thermal atomic beam is decelerated by a zeeman slower and is captured and cooled in a magneto - optical trap . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms are then transfered into a cloverleaf style ioffe - pritchard magnetic trap and cooled to quantum degeneracy with radio frequency induced forced evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> typical condensates contain 20 million atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the design includes a second vacuum chamber into which ultracold atoms can be transported with an optical tweezers . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the flexibility to rapidly prepare and perform a wide variety of experiments . </S>"
