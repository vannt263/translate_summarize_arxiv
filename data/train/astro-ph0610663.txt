    "quite a large number of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are associated with emission - line nebulae ( ulx nebulae , ulxne ) , mostly large - scale bubbles powered by shock waves ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( pakull & mirioni , 2003 ) ) . however , several exceptions are known like the nebula associated with hoii  x-1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( lehmann , 2005 ) ) , that is clearly a photoionized h  ii  region .",
    "another well - known example is the nebula mf16 coincident with the ulx ngc6946  ulx1 .",
    "the attention to mf16 was first drawn by @xcite , who identified the object as a supernova remnant ( snr ) , according to the emission - line spectrum with bright collisionally - excited lines .",
    "it was long considered an unusually luminous snr , because of its huge optical emission - line ( @xmath3 , according to @xcite , for the tangential size @xmath4 ) and x - ray ( @xmath5 in the @xmath6kev range , according to the luminosities given by @xcite ) .",
    "however , it was shown by @xcite , that the spectral , spatial and timing properties of the x - ray source do not agree with the suggestion of a bright snr , but rather suppose a point source with a typical `` ulx - like '' x - ray spectrum : cool multicolor disk ( mcd ) and a power law ( pl ) component .",
    "so , apart from the physical nature of the object , mf16 should be considered a _ ulx nebula _ , one of a new class of objects , described by @xcite .",
    "all the data were obtained on the sao 6 m telescope , russia .",
    "two spectrographs were used : panoramic multipupil fiber spectrograph mpfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( afanasiev , 2001 ) ) and scorpio focal reducer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( afanasiev & moiseev , 2005 ) ) in long - slit mode .",
    "the details of data reduction processes and analysis technique will be presented in @xcite .",
    "panoramic spectroscopy has the advantage of providing unbiased flux estimates",
    ". however , scorpio results have much higher signal - to - noise ratio and reveal rich emission - line spectrum of [ fe  iii ] .",
    "we also confirm the estimates of the total nebula emission - line luminosities by @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 line luminosity obtained from our mpfs data is @xmath8 .    using line ratios for the integral spectrum we estimate the mean parameters of emitting gas as : @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "interstellar absorption is estimated as @xmath11 , close to the galactic value ( @xmath12 , according to @xcite )    we confirm the estimate of the expansion rate obtained by @xcite , coming to the conclusion that the expansion velocity is @xmath13@xmath1 . in this case",
    "the total emission - line luminosity can be estimated using for example the equations be @xcite :    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the shock velocity and @xmath16 the pre - shock hydrogen density . if the surface area is known , one can obtain the total luminosity in @xmath7 from here .",
    "for @xmath17 and @xmath18 it appears to be @xmath19ergs  s@xmath20 , that is too low compared to the observed value .",
    "so we suggest an additional source of power providing most of the energy of the optical nebula .",
    "we have computed a grid of cloudy96.01  ( * ? ? ? * ( ferland , 1998 ) ) photoionization models in order to fit mf16 spectrum avoiding shock waves .",
    "we have fixed x - ray spectrum known from _",
    "chandra _ observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( roberts & colbert , 2003 ) ) , assuming all the plasma is situated at 10pc from the central point source , and introduced a blackbody source with the temperature changing from @xmath21 to @xmath22k and integral flux densities from 0.01 to 100 @xmath23 .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath24 , that suggests quite a luminous ultraviolet source : @xmath25.the",
    "uv source is more than 100 times brighter then what can be predicted by extrapolating the thermal component of the best - fit model for x - ray data ( * ? ? ? * ( roberts & colbert , 2003 ) ) .",
    "at least for one source we have indications that its x - ray spectrum extends in the euv region .",
    "it is interesting to analyse the implications in the frameworks of two most popular hypotheses explaining the ulx phenomenon .    for the standard disk of @xcite the inner temperature scales as :    @xmath26    in fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] we present the reconstructed spectral energy distribution of ngc6946  ulx-1 including optical identification by @xcite and the best - fit blackbody from our model . for comparison , a set of mcd seds for imbhs accreting at 1% of critical rate is shown .",
    "to explain the high euv luminosity and roughly flat sed in the euv region , a rather high imbh mass is needed , @xmath27@xmath28 .    for supercritical disk",
    "this relation breaks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( poutanen , 2006 ) ) , and the outcoming radiation becomes much softer , except for the x - rays escaping along the disk axis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( fabrika , 2007 ) ) .",
    "most part of the luminosity is supposed to be reprocessed into euv and uv quanta , creating the nearly - flat sed of ngc6946  ulx1 . in optical / uv range contribution of the donor star",
    "may become significant .",
    "* ( blair , 2000 ) ) is shown by an asterisk , and the upward arrow above indicates the unabsorbed optical luminosity : it is the lower estimate because only galactic absorption was taken into account , @xmath29 according to @xcite .",
    "dashed line represents the best - fit blackbody from our cloudy fitting .",
    "thin solid lines are mcd models for accreting imbhs with infinite outer disk radii .",
    "mass accretion rate was set everywhere to @xmath30 . ]    in @xcite we make estimates for the detectability of ulxs with galex , coming to the conclusion that at least some of them ( the sources with lower galactic absorption ) may be bright enough targets even for low - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we conclude that mf16 is most likely a dense shell illuminated from inside . this can be a certain stage of the evolution of a ulxn , when the central source is bright and the shell itself rather compact .",
    "we suggest that ulxs must be luminous euv sources as well in some cases , and may be also luminous uv sources ."
