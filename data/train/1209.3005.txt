    "a continuously interacting background environment tends to destroy quantum state coherence . quantum non - separability",
    "( entanglement ) , which plays a key role in various quantum computing and quantum communication proposals @xcite , is the best - known example of non - local coherence .",
    "regarding separability , it is known that there is set of finite measure of separable states .",
    "if the steady state solution of a master equation for an initially entangled state lies on the interior of this set , then the transition from an entangled to a separable state has to occur after only a finite time of evolution .",
    "a version of these facts is discussed in specific terms in connection with an event which is called esd ( early - stage decoherence or more commonly entanglement sudden death ) by yu and eberly @xcite and by al qasimi and james @xcite .",
    "the inevitability of esd for a class of initial states does not , however , make available the actual time when esd will occur .",
    "knowledge of the esd time allows one , in at least some situations , to undertake preparations to avoid or delay its onset . in the following we address this question .",
    "studies have been made to examine the ways in which esd depends on dissipation mechanisms ( e.g. , amplitude damping @xcite , phase damping @xcite , and others @xcite ) , and/or on interaction structures ( e.g. , interacting @xcite or non - interacting @xcite entangled partners , common @xcite or independent @xcite reservoirs ) , etc .",
    "most of these factors are difficult to control in practice . in this letter",
    "we extend the study of esd control in a straightforward way by systematically deriving connections between esd and initial conditions , about which only isolated facts are noted , e.g. , in the study of esd for werner - like @xcite and x - type @xcite of initial states .",
    "we focus on the consequences of the initial preparation of entanglement , purity , and double excitation probability .",
    "their initial values may be critical for an experiment s design and also for avoiding noise - induced esd during the experimental time interval , but these initial values are not always easy to establish precisely .",
    "however , for the generic case of exposure to amplitude noise , one can identify initial - value phase spaces which contain finite zones of safe preparation .",
    "that is , within the well - defined boundaries of these zones the state evolution is guaranteed not to be esd - susceptible . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first indication that such phase boundaries exist for any specific dissipation mechanism , and we provide formulas for the boundary curves .",
    "additionally , analysis of the esd - susceptible phases allows us to determine another feature of esd that has remained generically unknown , namely the precise time when esd will occur , if it is to occur at all . the esd onset time is found to be very sensitive to the initial purity in the vicinity of critical purity points . especially for initial states with very high or low entanglement",
    ", we show that a small amount of state impurity will accelerate the esd process dramatically . among potential advantages in practice",
    ", the conditions we have found allow protection from esd and may be useful in guiding experiments toward preparation of states that are immune to esd or have relatively longer esd times .",
    "as an example we can consider the not quite perfect preparation of bell states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are known to be vulnerable to esd in any combination . we suppose that a quantum computation task aims to use a generic combination such as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are orthogonal states of qubit @xmath5 , etc . , and may be interpreted as excited and ground states . in this state",
    "the degree of entanglement between the two qubits , as measured by concurrence @xcite , is @xmath6 .    in reality , in preparation , a state will deviate from the ideal target state . to sketch",
    "how this might occur we can begin with the state after its preparation .",
    "it is coupled to an environment that will cause post - preparation decoherence , and also still entangled with marginal entities denoted by @xmath7 , i.e. , forces , fields and objects that may participate in the preparation phase but then cease interaction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus we write : @xmath8\\otimes |\\phi_{0}\\rangle_{a}|\\phi_{0}\\rangle_{b}. \\label{initial}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 determines the degree of excitation of the two - party state via @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the normalized initial states ( usually ground states ) of environmental reservoirs @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are normalized states of the marginal system @xmath7 . imperfect control of the preparation leads to a possibly mixed rather than pure initial state via the relation @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 are the matrix elements of the initial two - qubit reduced density matrix @xmath20",
    "we next consider the dynamics of the two - qubit entanglement to see how it is affected by the initial state specification , and expose each qubit to the same amplitude damping process @xcite : @xmath21 is another environmental reservoir state with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the probability that qubit @xmath5 remains in its excited state . for the simplest illustration",
    "we assume exponential decay and take @xmath24 .",
    "then the excitation - transfer probability @xmath25 will grow from @xmath26 to @xmath27 irreversibly with increasing dimensionless time @xmath28 .",
    "qubit @xmath29 and reservoir @xmath15 are characterized similarly as ( [ channel ] ) with decay probability @xmath30 .",
    "of course this is more specialized than needed - the rates of change @xmath31 need not be the same for both qubits , and the amplitude channel can also be used to characterize non - dissipative evolutions such as produced by the xy spin interaction @xcite or the jaynes - cummings interaction @xcite .    amplitude damping takes the initial state ( [ initial ] ) to the time - dependent state @xmath32 here because of the fact that the marginal entity has ceased interaction with the qubit system after @xmath33 , the time dependent marginal states preserve the overlap relation @xmath34 .",
    "then the two - qubit time - dependent reduced density matrix is obtained by tracing off the reservoir and marginal states , yielding :    @xmath35    the two - party entanglement ( concurrence @xcite ) obeys the x - state formula @xcite : @xmath36 which is graphed in two ways in fig .",

    "these parameters are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , namely the initial entanglement ( concurrence ) , initial excited state population , and a normalized value of purity .",
    "the true initial purity is given by @xmath41 and the normalized version is defined as @xmath42 which takes values conveniently between 0 and 1 .",
    "the plots in fig . [ c vs t ] are only for a specific category of two - party states , but are systematically exhaustive in the sense that any arbitrary combination of the @xmath43 bell states is included , as well as any initial purity , excitation strength , and concurrence .",
    "it turns out that their esd boundaries are directly analyzable , as follows .",
    "first we use ( [ rhot ] ) and ( [ c(t ) ] ) at @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , to characterize the entire physical domain in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "non - negativity of @xmath49 requires the value of @xmath47 to be bounded between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52/2 $ ] , for any fixed @xmath48 . from the fact that @xmath53 , one immediately has @xmath54    within this domain , as @xmath55 ,",
    "both @xmath56 and @xmath57 and their product grow from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "then it is easy to identify within the physical domain the boundaries between esd and non - esd phases .",
    "the condition @xmath58 tells us that esd occurs wherever @xmath59 from the fact that @xmath60 , one immediately notes that esd is restricted to the domain where the initial double excitation number is greater than half of the initial concurrence , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "the opposite region @xmath62 is esd - free .",
    "this leads to the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram1 ] , which locates the esd and esd - free phases in terms of initial concurrence @xmath48 and the double excitation probability @xmath47 .",
    "the solid ( in color , red and blue ) boundary lines represent the values @xmath50 and @xmath51 as a function of @xmath48 . the dashed line @xmath63 is the critical phase boundary where the state crosses from the esd - free phase to the esd - inevitable phase .",
    "versus the double excitation number @xmath47 .",
    "the esd phase ( shaded area ) and esd - free phase ( unshaded area ) are separated by the dashed critical line @xmath63.,width=188 ]    an important implication of this analysis is that one needs to prepare the state with low double excitation , @xmath64 , in order to avoid esd .",
    "therefore we will focus on this region of greatest interest and assume @xmath65 in the following discussion .     versus the initial normalized purity @xmath40 .",
    "the esd phase ( shaded area ) and esd - free phase ( unshaded area ) are separated by the dashed critical line @xmath66.,width=188 ]    we now go a further step by employing the fact that the initial concurrence @xmath48 and the double excitation probability @xmath47 are simply related to the initial state purity @xmath67 as in ( [ true purity ] ) .",
    "then the esd - onset condition ( [ first ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the initial concurrence and normalized purity @xmath40 as follows @xmath68 where the non - negativity of the initial density matrix now requires that the normalized purity @xmath40 obeys @xmath69 and @xmath70 for any fixed @xmath48 .",
    "[ phasediagram2 ] locates the esd and esd - free phases in @xmath48-@xmath40 space .",
    "the ( in color , red and blue ) solid lines represent the values @xmath71 and @xmath72 as functions of @xmath48 . the dashed line is defined by @xmath73 which specifies the critical purity , as a function of @xmath48 , where the state crosses from the esd - free phase to the esd - inevitable phase .",
    "one sees that the states with very high or very low initial concurrences are quite fragile and require very high purity in order to avoid esd .",
    "states with initial concurrence around @xmath74 are the most robust , because they tolerate the widest range @xmath75 $ ] of variation of @xmath40 or , in other words , have higher tolerance of preparation errors ( permitting lower initial purity ) before breaking down to be esd - susceptible .",
    "this may have application in preparing esd - free states .",
    "although the phase boundaries are now located , there remains a question of near - boundary values of concurrence . in the esd - inevitable regions",
    "the onset of esd is not instantaneous so temporary preservation of entanglement can be obtained if the parameter region close enough to the phase boundary for esd onset can be well defined .    within an esd - susceptible zone",
    "we denote by @xmath76 the time when esd occurs and entanglement permanently vanishes , i.e. , the esd onset time .",
    "that is , @xmath76 is the value of @xmath28 when relation ( [ second ] ) is an equality . with @xmath77 , the onset time",

    "[ tesdsurface ] that for any fixed initial concurrence @xmath79 $ ] , the esd time is very sensitive to the initial purity in the vicinity of its critical values @xmath80 . especially for the states having very high or very low initial concurrences ,",
    "a small departure of the initial state from @xmath81 will accelerate the esd process dramatically .     and initial normalized purity @xmath40 .",
    "the steepness of the boundary indicates existence of a narrow zone of  safe \" state preparation , even though susceptible to esd.,width=188 ]    an important practical point is that we can talk about three zones with clear meaning .",
    "one is the zone of infinite onset time , where esd can not occur , and one is the zone where esd occurs inevitably and very rapidly .",
    "a more interesting zone is the one where the onset time for esd is delayed in a definite way .",
    "a practical issue could be that we can tolerate one dissipative lifetime of decay , but only if we can be assured that esd will not occur .",
    "this means that we need to know the tolerable equivalent parameter range for the initial preparation . to illustrate this case",
    ", we impose on fig .",
    "[ phasediagram2 ] another boundary line , located at @xmath82 , and show the result in fig .",
    "[ tesd - ryg ] .",
    "the yellow zone shows how the parameter range available to the preparation process can be expanded into the esd - susceptible phase , tolerating some entanglement dissipation while remaining certain to avoid esd up to the predetermined time @xmath82 .",
    "in summary , we have reported new results bearing on the behavior of non - local decoherence and its potential for being managed or even controlled . as is well known and demonstrated",
    "@xcite esd exists , i.e. , decoherence processes can drive prepared entanglement to zero at the same time that easily monitored local coherences and fidelity remain non - zero .",
    "its inverse process , sudden birth of entanglement @xcite , is equally interesting and is the subject of a later report .    until now there have been no rules of thumb or intuitive guides giving reliable information about the likely occurrence or non - occurrence of esd even in the simplest instances of entanglement and under the simplest of decoherence mechanisms .",
    "we have considered a bell superposition state as practically the simplest possible entanglement scenario , and have subjected it to amplitude damping , a well - understood decoherence mechanism .",
    "similar steps have been taken previously but only for specific initial density matrices generated _ ad hoc _ for demonstration purposes .",
    "in contrast , our findings amount to a first step toward defining a set of management tools that permit the range and extent of entanglement decoherence to be bounded and controlled . these tools , i.e. , the values of initial purity , entanglement and excitation , are based only on knowledge of parameters that are presumably under good control during any specific entangled state preparation .",
    "more importantly , the zone - control nature of these management tools , i.e. , the fact that esd susceptibility is determined over separate zones of a continuous variation of initial conditions , allows a well - defined amount of margin for errors in practical imperfect preparations .",
    "notably , knowledge or control of initial phases is not needed .",
