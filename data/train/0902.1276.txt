    "for quantum computers to become a reality we need to find or build physical systems that faithfully implement the quantum gates used in the algorithms of quantum computation .",
    "the basic requirement is that the experimenter has access to two states of a quantum system that can be effectively decoupled from environmental noise for a sufficiently long time , and that transitions between these two states can be controlled to simulate a number of elementary quantum gates ( unitary transformations ) .",
    "systems that have been investigated intensively are atomic levels in ion traps @xcite , superconducting device physics using josephson rings @xcite , nuclear spins @xcite(using nmr in suitable molecules ) and quantum dots @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the implementation of quantum gates using one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 systems .",
    "the results are obtained using a computer simulation of these systems .",
    "the hamiltonian of the xxz model with kink boundary conditions is given by @xmath2 + { j}\\sqrt{1-\\delta^{-2}}(s_{-l+1}^3 - s_l^3)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the spin-@xmath6 matrices acting on the site @xmath7 .",
    "apart from the magnitude of the spins , @xmath0 , the main parameter of the model is the anisotropy @xmath8 and the limit @xmath9 is referred to as the _ ising limit_. in the case of @xmath10 kink boundary conditions were first introduced in @xcite .",
    "they lead to ground states with a domain wall between down spins on the left portion of the chain and up spins on the right .",
    "the third component of the magnetization , @xmath11 , is conserved , and there is exactly one ground state for each value of @xmath11 .",
    "different values of @xmath11 correspond to different positions of the domain walls , which in one dimension are sometimes referred to as kinks . in @xcite ,",
    "koma , nachtergaele , and starr showed that there is a spectral gap above each of the ground states in this model for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "recently @xcite it was shown that for spin values @xmath12 and for sufficiently large value of the anisotropy @xmath13 the low lying spectrum of ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) for each value of @xmath11 has isolated eigenvalues that persist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the presence of isolated eigenvalues is ideal from the point of view of quantum computation .",
    "the idea is to use the subspace , denoted by @xmath14 , of the ground state and the first excited state of the hamiltonian to encode a qubit .",
    "we let the system evolve under its own unitary time evolution generated by the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) with the addition of a few local control fields .",
    "we have two requirements to fulfill : the time evolution should leave the qubit space @xmath14 approximately invariant , and the ( approximately ) unitary matrix describing the dynamics restricted to @xmath14 and stopped at a suitable time should coincide with the desired quantum gate .    the control inputs needed to drive the system such that high fidelity gates are obtained are determined using techniques from optimal control theory .",
    "the simulation of the time evolution of the chain that is large enough to resemble the properties in the thermodynamic limit is carried out using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm .",
    "figure [ fig : proftrans ] shows the transition of the magnetic profiles in the z - direction from the ground to the first excited state using the not gate constructed from a spin-@xmath15 xxz spin chain of length 50 sites .",
    "we also demonstrate the construction of pi-8 , hadamard , and phase gates that form a set of universal single qubit gates .    in order to have a viable quantum computing scheme one needs to implement at least one 2-qubit gate . here",
    "we have implemented the c - not gate which , in combination with the 1-qubit gates , is known to be universal @xcite .",
    "our scheme capitalizes on the kink nature of the excitations of the xxz hamiltonian , which are rather sharply localized .",
    "we imagine a setup with two parallel chains with the location of the kink lined up in their ground states .",
    "the subspace for the 2-qubit state space is then @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the space of isolated eigenvalues of the first chain and @xmath18 for the second chain .",
    "a set of three controls localized near the kinks is used to generate the single qubit gates acting on @xmath17 and @xmath18 and a c - not gate on @xmath16 .",
    "this scheme produces a universal set of gates necessary for two - qubit computation .",
    "it is clear how to generalize this scheme to implement n - qubit computation . since a universal set of single qubit gates and nearest neighbor c - not gates",
    "are universal for n - qubit computation , this can be achieved by using @xmath19 parallel chains and controls that are localized and act on neighboring chains only .    in the next section",
    "we describe the model and review some of the past results .",
    "then , in section [ sec : control ] , the optimal control problem to construct the quantum gates is described .",
    "section [ sec : dmrg ] is devoted to the dmrg algorithm and the specific adaptations to the xxz spin chain .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : results ] we present our results based on numerical simulations of the xxz hamiltonian using the dmrg algorithm .",
    "in this section we describe in detail the spin-@xmath0 ferromagnetic xxz model with kink boundary conditions on the one - dimensional lattice @xmath20 .",
    "the local hilbert space for a single site @xmath7 is @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "we consider the hilbert space for a finite chain on the sites @xmath23 = \\{-l+1,-l+2,\\dots,+l\\}$ ] .",
    "this is @xmath24}=\\bigotimes_{\\alpha =- l+1}^l\\mathcal{h}_\\alpha$ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin-@xmath6 xxz model is given by equation ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "note that , by a telescoping sum , we can absorb the boundary fields into the local interactions : @xmath25 the main parameter of the model is the anisotropy @xmath8 and we get the ising limit as @xmath9 .",
    "it is mathematically more convenient to work with the parameter @xmath26 , which we then assume is in the interval @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "as we said , @xmath28 is the ising limit , and @xmath29 is the isotropic xxx heisenberg model",
    ". the hamiltonian commutes with the total magnetization @xmath30 as indicated in the introduction , for each @xmath31 , the corresponding sector is defined to be the eigenspace of @xmath32 with eigenvalue @xmath11 ; clearly , these are invariant subspaces for all the hamiltonians introduced above .",
    "these subspaces are called `` sectors '' .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the kink boundary conditions lead to a family of ground states .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that for each sector there is a unique ground state of @xmath33 with eigenvalue 0 . moreover ,",
    "this ground state , @xmath34 , is given by the following expression : @xmath35}\\binom{2{j}}{{j}-m_\\alpha}^{1/2 } q^{\\alpha({j}-m_\\alpha)}{\\vert{m_\\alpha}\\rangle}_\\alpha\\ , , \\ ] ] where the sum is over all configurations for which @xmath36 and the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows a sharp transition in the magnetization from fully polarized down at the left to fully polarized up at the right .",
    "for this reason they are called kink ground states . in @xcite , koma , nachtergaele , and starr showed that there is a spectral gap above each of the ground states in this model for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "recently @xcite we were able to prove the following theorem .    for spin values",
    "@xmath39 , there exists a finite @xmath40 so that for all @xmath41 , the first few excitations of @xmath33 when restricted to any sector of magnetization , are isolated eigenvalues that persist in the thermodynamic limit .    in this paper",
    "it was also proved that in certain values of spin and sector , for example @xmath42 and @xmath43 both the ground and excited states are non - degenerate ( simple eigenvalues ) .",
    "this is the qubit space we work with and our quantum gates will be unitaries on this space .",
    "the problem of constructing quantum gates can be formulated as a problem in quantum control theory @xcite .",
    "the goal is to steer the system using a small number of control parameters such that the unitary operator describing the quantum dynamics after a finite time @xmath44 , has maximal overlap with a desired target unitary ( the gate ) .",
    "> from a control perspective these problems reduce to control of bilinear systems evolving on finite dimensional lie groups .",
    "this is an optimal control problem on a two - level system which has been studied widely with exact results known in some cases .",
    "for example , time optimal implementation of single and two qubit quantum gates was studied @xcite when the lie algebra @xmath45 of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) can be decomposed as a cartan pair @xmath48 with @xmath49 is the lie subalgebra generated by a the drift hamiltonian and @xmath50 is the lie sub algebra generated by the control hamiltonian s .",
    "finding the time optimal trajectories is reduced to finding geodesics on the coset space @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 being the lie groups corresponding to @xmath45 and k ) .",
    "the problem of driving the evolution operator while minimizing an energy - type quadratic cost was studied in @xcite . in this case",
    "the optimal solutions can be expressed as elliptic functions .",
    "the time optimal problem of population transfer problem of a two - level quantum system and bounded controls was studied in @xcite and again explicit expressions for the optimal trajectories . in this paper",
    "we follow a numerical gradient based approach to optimal control @xcite .",
    "we consider the problem of time evolution of the one - dimensional xxz chain under external controls .",
    "the equation of motion for the unitary evolution of the xxz chain isolated from the environment is given by schrdinger s equation @xmath54 in control terminology @xmath33 is the free or drift hamiltonian and @xmath55 is the control hamiltonian corresponding to the control field @xmath56 .",
    "we require that @xmath14 is an invariant subspace of @xmath55 , so that the time evolution of the system [ eqn : control1 ] given by the unitary @xmath57 starting from an initial state in @xmath14 will be constrained to @xmath14 at all future times .",
    "the induced evolution on @xmath14 at any specified final time @xmath44 will be the quantum gate on the qubit space @xmath14 and is given by the 2x2 matrix    @xmath58    the control hamiltonian we choose is the two site operator @xmath59 . in practice for @xmath60",
    "there is a very small error probability for states to move out of @xmath14 and the matrix @xmath61 is not exactly unitary .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xmath64 are proportional to the transition probabilities to move from states @xmath65 and @xmath66 to other eigenstates of @xmath33 .",
    "we calculate the error probability to move out of the subspace @xmath14 by the following estimates of these matrix elements @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig : err_prob ] shows that the probabilities of transitioning out of the subspace @xmath14 are extremely small for @xmath69 .",
    "the idea for implementing two - qubit gates is to use two copies of the xxz chain .",
    "the hilbert space for two - qubit quantum computation is @xmath70 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the subspaces spanned by the ground state and first excited state of the first chain and second chain respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian of an uncoupled two chain system is given by @xmath71 here the notation @xmath72 is to be interpreted as @xmath73 and @xmath74 is to be interpreted as @xmath75 .",
    "the two - qubit space is spanned by the four vectors @xmath76 for @xmath77 which are eigenvectors of the above hamiltonian .",
    "if we consider the control system @xmath78 with @xmath79 , then by selectively turning on @xmath80 and @xmath81 for certain time periods , the above system is equivalent to the control system ( [ eqn : control1 ] ) on chains 1 and 2 respectively during those time intervals .",
    "this can be used to generate single qubit gates on @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "moreover by simultaneously using @xmath80 and @xmath81 the local gates i.e. gates of the kind @xmath82 can be generated on @xmath16 . to implement a two - qubit quantum computing scheme we need to also implement perfectly entangling gates i.e. a gate that can take a product state to a maximally entangled state .",
    "it is known that single qubit gates and any perfectly entangling gate are universal for two - qubit quantum computing @xcite . clearly such a gate can not be implemented by the control scheme ( [ eqn : control2 ] ) alone . in this paper",
    "we choose to implement the c - not gate , which is an example of a perfectly entangling gate . for this purpose",
    "we make use of an additional control namely @xmath83 .",
    "we demonstrate the c - not gate to high precision by using following control system @xmath84 with @xmath79 by selectively turning on and off some or all of the control fields",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath85 for specified time periods . figure [ fig : xxz_schematic ] shows a diagrammatic representation of the two - qubit scheme .",
    "the c - not gate is then given by the @xmath86 matrix with elements @xmath87      we first solve the control problems ( [ eqn : control1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : control3 ] ) for the projected system on @xmath14 for the single chain and @xmath16 for two chain system .",
    "@xmath88 for the projected system on @xmath14 the @xmath89 and @xmath90 s are given by the @xmath91 matrices @xmath92 whereas the the projected system on @xmath16 the control problem involves @xmath86 matrices @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "the overlap between a desired unitary gate @xmath95 and the solution of ( [ eqn : control3 ] ) at time @xmath44 , @xmath96 , is measured as the difference in the norm square @xmath97 , and the norm is defined in terms of the standard inner product @xmath98 .",
    "the norm can be written as @xmath99 and hence minimizing this norm is equivalent to maximizing @xmath100 we define the gate fidelity as @xmath101 to select the optimal control fields @xmath102 we use the numerical gradient ascent approach described in many books on control theory .",
    "this approach was applied to the quantum setting in @xcite .",
    "we start with the necessary conditions for optimality called the pontryagin maximum principle which is a generalization of the euler - lagrange equations from calculus of variations . in the problems with costs of type ( [ eqn : cost ] ) and no a priori bound on controls , pontryagin s maximum principle takes the following form    ( pontryagin maximum principle ) if @xmath102 s are optimal controls of the system ( [ eqn : control3 ] ) and @xmath57 the corresponding trajectory solution , then there exists a nonzero operator valued lagrange multiplier @xmath103 which is the solution of the adjoint equations @xmath104 and a scalar valued hamiltonian function @xmath105 such that , for every @xmath106 $ ] we have @xmath107    the algorithm to find the optimal controls is as follows    1 .   a suitable gate time @xmath44 is chosen and discretized in @xmath108 equal steps of duration @xmath109 . the initial control @xmath110 for all the discretized time intervals",

    "substitute the equations ( [ eqn : fequation ] ) and ( [ eqn : bequation ] ) into equation ( [ eqn : gradient ] ) to evaluate the gradient , and then update the controls as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a small step size .",
    "4 .   if @xmath118 ( @xmath119 being the level of accuracy ) then done , otherwise goto step ( 2 ) for the next iteration with the updated controls .",
    "having solved the control problem on the projected systems to get the optimal controls @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath85 we would like to apply them to a large system and see their effects on the projected system . however simulating",
    "even a moderately sized spin chain is hard because of the exponentially growing dimension of the hilbert space . in the next section",
    "we describe an algorithm by which we are able to simulate the xxz chain of 50 sites .",
    "to see the effect of the evolution of the xxz chain with external magnetic controls we numerically simulate the xxz chain using the dmrg algorithm .",
    "the dynamics of the interfaces of the xxz chain using dmrg was studied recently in @xcite .",
    "the standard dmrg algorithm is a numerical algorithm originally developed by steven white @xcite that has worked successfully in providing very accurate results for ground state energies and correlation functions in strongly correlated systems .",
    "modifications to this method @xcite allow to address the physics of time - dependent and out of equilibrium systems .",
    "the crux of the dmrg algorithm is a decimation procedure that chooses the physically most relevant states to describe the target states .",
    "it is now known that dmrg works well because the ground states of non - critical quantum chains like the xxz chain are only slightly entangled , i.e. they obey an area law of entanglement that says that the entanglement between a distinguished block of the chain and the rest of the chain is bounded by the boundary area of the block .",
    "in fact the dmrg procedure is a variational ansatz over states known as matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "the standard dmrg procedure and its connection with mps and entanglement is described in detail in @xcite . for a single xxz chain",
    "our target states are the ground state @xmath65 and first excited state @xmath66 restricted to a sector of magnetization .",
    "we use the standard dmrg procedure with the adaptation that we grow the chain while restricting the blocks to the sector of zero magnetization using the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we define the local operators @xmath123 we can then write the hamiltonian of this single chain using the above construction @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "we carry out the dmrg procedure as described in the algorithm with the hamiltonian @xmath126 but we ensure that we keep both the chains in the magnetization sector 0 by simultaneously diagonalizing @xmath126 with the total magnetization operators @xmath127 the target states @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 are the simultaneous eigenvectors of the these operators and form the computational basis @xmath132 , @xmath133,@xmath134 and @xmath135 for two - qubit quantum computation .    to compute the time evolution of the chain under the controlled evolution by the external fields we use the time - dependent dmrg procedure .",
    "the idea is that a two site operator can be applied to a dmrg state most effectively by expressing the state in the basis where the left block has length @xmath136 so the two middle sites that are untruncated are the the sites where the operator is acting .",
    "we can write the time evolution in the trotter decomposition @xmath137 to apply @xmath138 to the ground and excited states in the basis with the center sites all the way to the left we apply @xmath139 . after shifting one site to the right we apply @xmath140 etc . since all our controls are two site controls at the center , only the interaction @xmath141 is time - dependent . in the adaptive time - dependent methods",
    "the hilbert space is continuously modified as time progresses by carrying out reduced basis transformations on the evolved state . in our case since the gates are obtained in a relatively short period of time our hilbert space remains unchanged resembling the static dmrg methods .",
    "in this section we present numerical results of the construction of quantum gates using the spin-3/2 xxz spin chain .",
