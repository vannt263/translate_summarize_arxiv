    "it has been shown recently in @xcite , that in order to consider the contribution of the absorbtion processes connected with binary ion - atom systems to the opacity of the solar photosphere it is not enough to take into account only the processes of absorbtion charge exchange in ( h + h@xmath0)-collisions and the molecular ion h@xmath4 photo - dissociation .",
    "these processes were studied in @xcite and @xcite , and are already included in one of the solar photosphere models @xcite .",
    "it has been established that in the very important far uv and euv spectral regions they have to be considered together with the processes of the absorbtion charge exchange and photo - association in non - symmetric ( h + x@xmath0)-collisions and molecular ion h@xmath5 photo - dissociation , where @xmath6 is one of metal atoms .",
    "namely , it has been proved that only in such case the total efficiency of the ion - atom absorbtion processes in the mentioned spectral regions approaches the efficiency of the relevant concurrent processes in the whole solar photosphere .",
    "these results suggest that it is useful to consider again the situation of ion - atom absorbtion processes in the atmospheres of helium - rich white dwarfs .",
    "let us remind that in the previous papers @xcite , dedicated to certain db white dwarf atmospheres , the processes of molecular ion he@xmath4 photo - dissociation were studied : @xmath7 and absorbtion charge exchange in ( he + he@xmath0)-collisions : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy of a photon with wavelength @xmath10 , he = he@xmath11 , he@xmath0 = he@xmath12 and he@xmath4 = he@xmath13 .",
    "the significance of these symmetric ion - atom absorption processes for the atmospheres of the considered db white dwarfs was established in @xcite and @xcite by a direct comparison of their efficiencies with the main concurrent process of inverse `` bremssthrallung '' in ( free electron + he)-collisions , i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote a free electron in the initial and final energetic states respectively .",
    "for that purpose the data from the corresponding db white - dwarf atmosphere models @xcite have been used .",
    "it was established that the processes ( [ eq : sim1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sim2 ] ) significantly influence the opacity of the considered db white dwarf atmospheres , with an effective temperature @xmath17 k , which fully justifies their inclusion in one of the models of such atmospheres @xcite . however , the same comparison demonstrated also that the dominant role in those atmospheres generally still belongs to the concurrent absorbtion process ( [ eq : e - he ] ) , while the processes ( [ eq : sim1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sim2 ] ) can be treated as dominant ( with respect to this concurrent process ) only in some layers of that atmospheres , and only within the part 50 nm@xmath18 250 nm of the far uv and euv region . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plank ] , where plank s curves for @xmath19 k and @xmath20 k are shown , this part is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "its boundary ( from the short - wavelength side ) is determined by the value of wavelength @xmath22 nm , which corresponds to the threshold of the atom he photo - ionization .",
    "hence it follows that in the case of helium - rich white dwarf atmospheres it would certainly be useful to include into consideration some new ion - atom absorbtion processes , which is principally allowed in accordance with the composition of such atmospheres @xcite .",
    "let us note in this context that in the case of white dwarf atmospheres with dominant helium component , among all possible symmetric ion - atom absorbtion processes which are allowed by their composition @xcite , only the processes ( [ eq : sim1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sim2 ] ) have to be taken into account .",
    "this means that in this case we can find new relevant absorbtion processes only among the processes connected with non - symmetric ion - atom systems , particulary such systems which could provide efficiency in the same part @xmath21 of the far uv and euv region . here",
    "we will examine the significance of non - symmetric ion - atom absorption processes with participation of the hydrogen component .",
    "we mean the processes of molecular ion heh@xmath0 photo - dissociation @xmath23 and the processes of absorption charge exchange and photo - association in the ( he + h@xmath0)-collisions , namely @xmath24 @xmath25 where h = h@xmath26 , he= he@xmath11 , he@xmath0 = he@xmath12 , and heh@xmath0 and ( heh@xmath0)@xmath27 denote the molecular ion in the ground and the first excited electronic states which are adiabatically correlated with the states of the systems he + h@xmath0 and he@xmath0 + h respectively at the infinite internuclear distance . already in @xcite it was noted that these processes , whose significance was practically neglected for the solar photosphere , could be rather important in the case of helium - rich white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "this assumption was worthy of attention , particulary due to the fact that characteristics of the considered non - symmetric molecular ions ( see fig.[fig : mol.ion ] ) provide manifestations of the processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) just in the part @xmath21 of the far uv and euv region .    in connection with this fact ,",
    "let us remind that the part @xmath21 is rather important for such values of @xmath28 .",
    "namely , let @xmath29 be the positions of the maxima of the spectral intensities characterizing the electromagnetic ( em ) emission of the considered atmospheres , which are determined from the well - known wien s law : @xmath30 nm @xmath31 k. we then have it that for the considered db white dwarfs @xmath32 nm , so that the mentioned maxima lie just within the region @xmath21 .",
    "it was just because of the above mentioned that this investigation was undertaken .",
    "the main aim was to study when the non - symmetric absorbtion processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) can significantly influence the opacity of helium - rich white dwarf atmospheres in the part @xmath21 of the uv and vuv spectral region , and to show that the processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) deserve to be included _",
    "ab initio _ in the corresponding white dwarf atmosphere models .",
    "therefore the relevant spectral characteristics of the processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) are determined here for the atmospheres of different helium - rich white dwarfs with @xmath19 k and @xmath20 k , log @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and for the values of the ratio h : he from @xmath1 to @xmath35 .",
    "the necessary expressions for these spectral characteristics are given in section 2 .",
    "then , with their help , in the section 3 the values are calculated of the parameters characterizing the relative efficiency of the non - symmetric processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) with respect to the efficiency of all ion - atom processes , as well as with respect to the electron - atom process ( [ eq : e - he ] ) , which comprise the main direct results of this work .",
    "let us note that already in @xcite , beside the electron - atom processes ( [ eq : e - he ] ) the process of photoionization of hydrogen atoms , was also considered , namely @xmath36 where h = h@xmath26 .",
    "it was treated as a concurrent process , potentially necessary in the region @xmath37 where @xmath38  corresponds to the threshold of atom h photoionization . however , in @xcite it was brought to attention that the importance of this absorption channel was significantly underestimated .",
    "that is why in this work the process ( [ eq : phi ] ) was again included into the consideration and carefully examined .",
    "one can see that in this work we take into account only such non - symmetric ion - atom absorption processes where , apart from the dominant helium component of the considered atmospheres , only the hydrogen component participates , although they contain also a lot of metal components @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the existing atmosphere models do not provide the necessary data ( about the relevant metals abundances ) which would be needed for the present calculations .",
    "however , we consider that a demonstration of the fact that for the considered atmospheres the processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) , where one of their `` minor '' components participates , are rather significant , is a sufficient reason for treating the non - symmetric ion - atom absorption processes in general as potentially significant for those atmospheres .",
    "as the relevant characteristics of the processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) , ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) we will use the corresponding spectral absorption coefficients .",
    "they are defined as functions of log @xmath39 , where @xmath39 is rosseland optical depth of the part of the examined atmosphere above the considered layer for the wavelength @xmath10 .",
    "they are denoted here as @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in accordance with the fact that the mentioned processes can be treated as bound - free , free - free and free - bound respectively .",
    "these coefficients are determined here within the corresponding atmosphere models , by means of the local temperature and the densities of he atoms and h@xmath0 ions , and used in a similar form , namely @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "of course , it is understood that the photo - dissociation rate coefficient @xmath48 is given by the known relations @xmath49 @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the mean thermal cross - section for the molecular ion heh@xmath0 photo - dissociation , @xmath52 denotes the local density of these molecular ions , and @xmath53 is determined under condition of local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) with given @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "let us note that these expressions contain no correction factors which take into account the influence of stimulated emission , since within the actual range of @xmath57 ratio for the considered cases the changes due to these factors will be of the order of magnitude of @xmath58 .    finally , the total efficiency of the non - symmetric processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) , ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) is characterized here by the spectral absorption coefficient @xmath59 given by the relations @xmath60 @xmath61 where the rate coefficients @xmath62 are determined by means of the necessary characteristics of the considered molecular ion , in a way which was described in detail in @xcite .    the mentioned characteristics , i.e. the adiabatic potential curves of the molecular ion in the ground state ( heh@xmath0 ) and the first excited electronic state ( ( heh@xmath0)@xmath27 ) , as well as the corresponding dipole matrix element ( which were not shown in @xcite ) are presented here in fig.[fig : mol.ion ] as functions of the internuclear distance @xmath63 .",
    "this figure also shows in a schematic way the bound - free ( bf ) , free - free ( ff ) and free - bound ( fb ) transitions between the energy states of the considered ion - atom system which correspond to the processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) , ( [ eq : nonsim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) .",
    "the potential curves are denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mol.ion ] by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and dipole matrix element - by @xmath66 .",
    "their values as functions of @xmath63 are determined here by fitting the corresponding data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us note that these data have a shortcoming : they are not sufficiently complete and do not guarantee that different ways of fitting give close values of @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "it is possible that this shortcoming causes the observed differences between our values of the partial cross - section for photo - dissociation of the ion heh@xmath0 from its ground ro - vibrational state and the values presented in @xcite , where they were calculated by means of the same data .",
    "however , here we used just the data from @xcite and @xcite since as yet only these papers give at least some data about both the necessary potential curves ( of the ion heh@xmath0 ) and the corresponding matrix element .",
    "also , we keep in mind that development of numerical procedures which would be suitable for improvement of the data presented in @xcite and @xcite far exceeds the aim of this work . apart from that , we consider that the deviations of the potential curves @xmath64 and @xmath65 from the hypothetical exact ones do not cause any large errors in the obtained results and consequently can not strongly influence the final conclusions .    since all processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) are connected with the transition between the ground and the first excited electronic states of the strongly non - symmetric ion - atom system ( heh@xmath0 or he + h@xmath0 ) we have it that the range of values of the splitting term ( @xmath67 ) well characterizes the range of photon energies which is relevant for those processes .",
    "it is just due to this fact that we could state above that the processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) have to be manifested in the part @xmath21 of the far uv and euv spectral region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plank ] ) .",
    "although the behavior of the rate coefficients @xmath62 was already discussed in @xcite , it is also illustrated here by fig .",
    "[ fig : kbffffb ] since the range of temperatures characterizing the solar photosphere is not relevant in our case .",
    "these figures give a possibility to estimate that the processes ( [ eq : nonsim1 ] ) - ( [ eq : nonsim3 ] ) can be significant in the spectral region denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig : plank ] by @xmath68 .      for the sake of the following considerations we have to introduce the spectral coefficients @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 which characterize the efficiencies of the symmetric ion - atom absorption processes ( [ eq : sim1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sim2 ] ) together , the electron - atom processes ( [ eq : e - he ] ) and hydrogen photoionization process ( [ eq : phi ] ) respectively . as in @xcite we can take these coefficients in the known form : @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the local densities of ions he@xmath0 , free electrons and atoms h , @xmath78 and @xmath79 - adequately defined spectral rate coefficients , and @xmath80 - spectral cross - section for atom h photoionization .",
    "the absorption coefficient @xmath78 is determined in the way which is described in detail in @xcite , and @xmath79 - by means of the data from @xcite , and @xmath80 is taken from @xcite .    here",
    "we take into account the fact that all the values of the rate coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 which are needed for our calculations have already been determined in @xcite , and that the photo - ionization cross - section @xmath80 is given by a known analytical expression .",
    "therefore in the further text we will simply treat these characteristics and , consequently , the spectral absorption coefficients @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath71 as known quantities .",

    "we will start from db white dwarf atmospheres with @xmath19 k and @xmath20 k , @xmath84 and @xmath34 and h : he @xmath85 . for their description we will use the equilibrium models which are presented in @xcite . as in @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "it is due to the fact that , although newer atmosphere models for helium - rich white dwarfs now exist ( see e.g. the review article of @xcite ) , only the models from @xcite contain in a tabular form all the relevant data which are needed for our calculations .",

    "namely , although the ion h@xmath0 density can not increase proportionally to the ratio h : he , an increase of this ratio of 10 or 100 times , has to cause an increase of @xmath56 of at least several times .",
