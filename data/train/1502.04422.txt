    "<S> we propose a scheme to investigate the interplay between kondo - exchange interaction and quantum spin hall effect with ultracold fermionic alkaline - earth atoms trapped in two - dimensional optical lattices using ultracold collision and laser - assisted tunneling . in the strong kondo - coupling regime , though the loop trajectory of the mobile atom disappears , collective dynamics of an atom pair in two clock states can exhibit an unexpected spin - dependent cyclotron orbit in a plaquette , realizing the quantum spin hall effect of the kondo singlet . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the collective cyclotron dynamics of the spin - zero kondo singlet is governed by an effective harper - hofstadter model in addition to second - order diagonal tunneling . </S>"
