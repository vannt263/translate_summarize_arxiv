    "a detailed description of the observations and data reduction is given in paper ii ; here we present a brief overview .",
    "each stis observation was obtained using the 0@xmath122  @xmath4  0@xmath122 aperture and the e140 m grating , which spans 11501730  , and consisted of two _ hst _ orbits for a total exposure time of @xmath3 4.9 ks ( except s1 which was 5.4 ks ) .",

    "the extracted stis spectra are sampled in @xmath3  0.017    bins , thereby preserving the full resolution of the stis / e140 m grating ( @xmath13  7  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectra , covering 905  1187  , were obtained through the 30@xmath14  @xmath4  30@xmath14 aperture .",
    "each spectrum was processed with the standard calibration pipeline , calfuse . for each observation ,",
    "the eight individual spectra obtained with _",
    "fuse _ from the combination of four mirror / grating channels and two detectors , were coadded for all exposures .",
    "we corrected for nonlinear shifts in wavelength scale between the spectra from different detector segments by cross - correlating over small bandpasses .",
    "the absolute wavelength scale was determined by matching the velocities of galactic lines in the _ fuse _ spectrum with those in the stis bandpass .",
    "mean residual fluxes measured in the cores of saturated galactic lines are consistent with zero within the noise ( i.e. , standard deviation of the fluxes ) in the troughs of these lines , indicating accurate background removal for all observations except f5 .",
    "for this observation , we fit the remaining residual background flux in strong interstellar lines to match the other epochs , and subtracted the fit .",
    "the spectra were resampled into @xmath3 0.02  0.03   bins to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) while preserving the full resolution of _ fuse _ , which is nominally @xmath13  20  km  s@xmath1 .      to put the continuum variations of our observations in perspective",
    ", figure 1a shows the continuum flux light curve at 1470    for all uv spectra of ngc 3783 obtained over the last 22 years .",
    "these observations were obtained with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) and the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) , ghrs , and stis ( in low dispersion ) on _ hst _ , which are listed in table  1 .",
    "we obtained the most recently processed version of each spectrum from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute .",
    "we measured the continuum fluxes in each spectrum by averaging the elements in a 30    bin centered at 1470    in the observed frame , which is free of contamination from line emission .",
    "the 1@xmath15 flux uncertainties were determined from the standard deviations .",

    "due to the small wavelength coverage of the ghrs spectra , no continuum regions free of broad line emission were observed . to estimate the ghrs continuum fluxes , we used separate fits to the continua and broad emission lines from the stis spectra and tested different linear combinations of these fits until we obtained an accurate match to the observed ghrs profiles",
    ". figure  1a shows the stis echelle observations ( jd  @xmath16  2,452,000 ) sampled the uv continuum in a range of moderately - low to moderately - high flux states compared to the long - term light curve .    in figure  1b ,",
    "the light curve for the monitoring campaign observations is shown in more detail .",
    "we have included estimated fluxes from the four _ fuse _ observations that were not simultaneous with stis observations ( f1 , f3 , f5 , f6 ) by extrapolating from the far - uv bandpass to 1470   .",
    "the first four observations ( s1  s4 ) were obtained at intervals of several months , the intensive monitoring phase ( s5  s17 ) sampled the continuum at 3  8 day intervals , and the final observation ( s18 ) was obtained about 9 months later .",
    "the extrema in continuum flux in the stis observations occurred during the long - term sampling ; s2 and s3 observed the continuum in the highest flux state and the final observation found it in the lowest state , with a peak amplitude variation of a factor of @xmath32.5 .",
    "we identify two general phases during the intensive monitoring : the first four observations ( s5  s8 ) sampled the continuum in a relatively low - state , after which it increased by up to a factor of 1.7 ( s10 and s12 ) over a period of about 2 weeks .",
    "three _ fuse _ observations ( f2  f4 ) were obtained during the low - state stis observations , while observation f5 observed the continuum in the highest state ( four days after s12 ) . in the subsequent variability analysis , we compare observations between mean low and high states derived by averaging representative spectra in each state .",
    "a key issue in the analysis of agn outflows is extracting accurate ionic column densities from the observed absorption lines , since they provide the basis for determining the physical conditions in the absorbers ( i.e. , the ionization state , total gas column , number density ) . the uv absorbers typically only partially occult the background agn emission , as determined by the relative strengths of the individual members of absorption doublets @xcite , and the effects of covering factor ( @xmath17 ) and optical depth ( @xmath18 ) must be deconvolved to determine the column densities . in some cases ,",
    "the @xmath19 solution for observed features can be complicated due to blending of physically distinct absorption components or complex coverage of the background emission .",
    "thus , it is useful to first explore absorption variability by comparing equivalent widths .",
    "figures 2a  c show the equivalent widths for key lines in the stis spectra of components 1  3 , respectively , plotted as a function of the uv continuum flux .",
    "the error bars represent our estimated measurement uncertainties , which are a combination of uncertainties due to spectral noise and fitting the intrinsic ( i.e. , unabsorbed ) fluxes , via propagation of errors .",
    "we estimated uncertainties in the intrinsic fluxes by testing different empirical fits over the absorption features and selecting the range of what we deemed to be reasonable line profile shapes .",
    "we note that these derived uncertainties may in some cases be too conservative , as indicated by comparing the scatter in measured values with the error bars plotted in figure 2 ( e.g. , in components 1 and 3 ) .",
    "this may be due to systematic trends in how the intrinsic flux was fit in each observation and/or overestimates of the uncertainties associated with the fitting .    in each kinematic component , the lowest - ionization species with detectable absorption other than ( in component  1 ; and in component  2 ; in component  3 ) show clear variations that are inversely proportional to the continuum flux .",
    "this is just as expected for unsaturated lines from relatively low - ionization species in a photoionized gas , as their column densities decrease in higher flux states due to the increased ionization .",
    "this gives direct evidence that the ionization structure in these absorbers is dominated by photoionization from the central source .",
    "it also indicates these lines are not highly saturated , at least in the epochs with weaker observed absorption . to test the dependence of absorption variability on continuum flux more rigorously",
    ", we did a linear regression fit for each line .",
    "figure  2 shows the results of the fits and gives the ratio of the computed slope to the 1@xmath15 uncertainty in the slope , @xmath20 , to characterize the correlation .",
    "fits to all of the lines listed above have a non - zero slope at greater than a 3@xmath15 level .",
    "since the absorption strengths will not necessarily vary linearly with continuum flux , we also tested the spearman rank correlation .",
    "all of the above lines show correlation with the flux at high significance , with probabilities of no correlation computed to be between 0.01  0.3 % from this test ( values are listed in figure 2 ) .",
    "conversely , the absorption strengths of in component  1 and in components 1 and 3 did not vary strongly during the monitoring .",
    "this could indicate either these lines were saturated , with partial covering factor , or their ionic column densities were not varying . in the latter case",
    ", the lack of variability could be due to either a relatively low electron density such that the ionic populations are unable to respond to continuum changes , or to the ionic structure of the gas , with these ions near the peak ionization states of their parent elements .",
    "these possibilities are explored below .",
    "we note that since each component has some lines that exhibit no variability ( see figure 2 and  3.2 ) , the lines that do vary must result from changes in ionic column densities rather than covering factors .",
    "the doublet method for measuring the absorption parameters provides a solution to a single @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( at each resolution element in an absorption profile ) .",
    "however , since the background agn emission is comprised of multiple , physically distinct components with different sizes and geometries ( i.e. , a featureless continuum source and multiple kinematic components of line emission ) , additional constraints may be needed to determine the required _ effective _ covering factors , which are weighted combinations of covering factors of the different emission sources ( ganguly et al .",
    "implicit in the doublet solution is that all emission sources have the same covering factor . in paper ii",
    ", we used the lyman series lines to separate the continuum and emission line covering factors for the absorption . here , we use variability in the background agn emission as an additional constraint to explore the effect of the nlr on the derived covering factors and obtain a consistent model to measure absorption column densities for all lines .",
    "we first compare spectra in different flux states to isolate distinct emission - line components based on variability in the overall profiles .",
    "figure 3a shows the line profiles in mean high - state ( s2 and s3 ) and low - state ( s5  s8 ) spectra ; these observations were selected for comparison because they show the largest difference in emission - line flux .",
    "the continuum flux has been subtracted from each spectrum and the low - state profile has been scaled by a factor of 1.4 to match the flux in the high - velocity wings of the high - state spectrum .",
    "the profiles match very well at radial velocities @xmath211500  km  s@xmath1 but diverge at lower velocities , with increasing discrepancy toward line center .",
    "this effect is consistent with the superposition of a varying broad component and a non - varying narrower emission - line component , hereafter the blr and nlr respectively .    assuming no change in the nlr flux between observations , we isolate its profile by solving the following expression for @xmath22 at each radial velocity : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the total observed emission - line fluxes in each state ( i.e. , the nlr @xmath26 blr fluxes ) and @xmath27 is the scale factor equating the low - state blr flux with the high - state .",
    "the resulting nlr profile is plotted as a dotted line in figure 3a .",
    "this analysis assumes the blr scales by a uniform factor at all radial velocities between states .",
    "equation  1 is not valid in spectral regions affected by absorption .",
    "we have fit the nlr profile using gaussians for each of the doublet lines constrained to have their intrinsic 2:1 flux ratio and velocity separation , giving a width of @xmath28  500  @xmath29120  km  s@xmath1 ( @xmath30  1180  @xmath29280  km  s@xmath1 ) at a radial velocity of @xmath2650  @xmath2960  km  s@xmath1 with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "the combined fit , which appears symmetrical due to the broad line width relative to the separation of the doublet members , is plotted over the residual nlr flux in figure 3a .",
    "we applied the same analysis to derive the nlr profiles of other emission lines using equation 1 .",
    "results for ly@xmath31 , , and ( @xmath321.4 , 1.8 , and 1.8 , respectively ) are shown in figure 3b .",
    "a scaled template of the gaussian fit to the nlr profile is overlaid on each residual nlr profile , including both lines for the and doublets .",
    "the discrepancy in the residual fluxes in the blue wing of ( @xmath332000  km  s@xmath1 ) and the red wing of ly@xmath31 ( @xmath34 3000  km  s@xmath1 ) is due to the different blr flux scale factors for the two lines and the overlap in their blr emission . the excess emission in the profile between @xmath3 1000  2500 km s@xmath1 is due to the o iv ] emission - line multiplet .",
    "the ly@xmath31 nlr is not well matched by the template , appearing narrower in the unabsorbed red wing of the profile .",
    "figure 3 shows the derived nlr fluxes contribute substantially at the wavelengths of many of the absorption features and thus its covering factor could affect the measurement of column densities , which we explore below .",
    "there are some caveats regarding the derivation of the nlr profiles .",
    "first , the assumption that the blr scale factor between the low and high states is independent of radial velocity may introduce an error into the solution .",
    "intensive uv  optical monitoring of continuum and blr variability in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 has revealed its blr variability is consistent with a constant virial product @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this is that the integrated blr profile becomes narrower in higher flux states ; if this is the case for the uv lines in ngc 3783 , then a velocity - dependent scale factor in equation  1 would be required to fully separate the nlr and blr . additionally , the profiles derived from this analysis are broader than are typical for uv nlr lines in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "for example , _ hst _ observations of ngc 5548 and ngc 4151 while in low flux states with little contamination from blr emission revealed @xmath11 500 and 300  km  s@xmath1 , respectively , for the nlr .",
    "however , the width derived for ngc 3783 is comparable to the rather broad nlr features in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 @xcite . to assess the nlr fit",

    "analysis of the lyman lines in paper ii revealed the emission - lines are only partially occulted by the uv absorbers .",
    "since the nlr is generally much more extended than the blr and continuum source in agns , we assume here a 3-component geometrical model in which the nlr is entirely unocculted by all components of uv absorption .",
    "later , we explore this assumption based on geometrical constraints from our analysis . in paper ii",
    ", the emission - line and continuum covering factors were separated assuming a single emission - line region . here",
    ", we incorporate the nlr  blr separation for our 3-component coverage model ( hereafter 3-@xmath17 ) by solving for the continuum and blr covering factor profiles , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , using the lyman lines as in paper ii after first subtracting a model of the ly@xmath31 nlr .",
    "given the mismatch between the ly@xmath31 nlr residual and template ( see discussion above and figure 3b ) , we fit the ly@xmath31 nlr with a narrower gaussian that matched both the uncontaminated red wing and core , and was constrained to be below the residual flux in the component  2 absorption feature ( @xmath28350  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "given the uncertainty in the nlr profile , we can not rule out that the deep component  2 feature partially occults the nlr of ly@xmath31 .    using equation 3 , we calculated effective covering factors for each absorption line , using the derived @xmath42 and @xmath43 profiles , and @xmath440 at all radial velocities . figure 4 shows the resulting normalized unocculted flux levels ( 1 @xmath45 ) for this 3-@xmath17 model compared to the observed normalized absorption profiles .",
    "regions where the residual fluxes in the absorption troughs are close to the unocculted flux levels ( @xmath46 ) indicate the lines are near saturation for this model . for each line ,",
    "results for both low and high - state spectra are shown to demonstrate the variability and implications of the covering factor on observed line strengths . to increase the s / n in each spectrum , we averaged multiple observations for each state , selecting observations that exhibited the largest variations in absorption strengths and continuum flux during the intensive monitoring .",
    "for the stis lines , the low state shown is the mean of s5  s8 , and the high state s10 and s12 , except for , which had the weakest absorption in observations s15 , s16 . for lines in the _ fuse _ spectrum ,",

    "column densities for the low and high - states in each component computed with equations 4 and 5 are given in table 2 .",
    "below , we describe the absorption lines for each kinematic component .    for the absorption ,",
    "both doublet members are free of contamination over most of the absorption profiles , providing a comparison between the doublet solution to the covering factor ( @xmath47 ) and our 3-@xmath17 model to test the effect of an unocculted nlr .",
    "the unocculted flux levels for the doublet solution ( 1@xmath48 ) are shown in figure 4a with horizontal tick marks for .",

    "this is confirmed for the new 3-@xmath17 model : the column density measured for the red doublet line with this covering factor is three times greater than the blue line , indicating the actual covering factor is significantly lower .",
    "in contrast , the 3-@xmath17 model gives consistent results for the two doublet members : saturation in the blue - wing and core in both flux states ( see above discussion ) , and similar column densities in the red - wing of the profile where the absorption depths diverge from the unocculted flux levels ( i.e. , the absorption is unsaturated ) .",
    "similarly ,  @xmath21548 and  @xmath21038 are consistent with being saturated in their blue wings and cores with the 3-@xmath17 model ( the other doublet members for these ions are unmeasurable due to contamination with other absorption ) , and diverges substantially in the red wing (  @xmath21038 is contaminated with a detector artifact at these velocities and can not be tested ) .",

    "as described in paper ii , the red wings of some lines , particularly and ly@xmath31 , extend to lower velocities than and .",
    "interestingly , it is at these velocities that the and profiles diverge from the unocculted flux levels from the covering factor model .",

    "we have done extensive modeling to test if this discrepancy between the measured uv and x - ray column densities can be reconciled for any values of the model parameters .",
    "we find no reasonable choice for an sed that reproduces the measured and column densities while maintaining unsaturated absorption in the uv doublet , due to the similarity in ionization potentials of these ions , nor does any combination of multiple components with different physical conditions .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that it is due to a geometrical effect .",
    "for example , the very large column density of implied by the xli model may be buried in the variable , unsaturated absorption in components 2 and/or 3 .",
    "this would require a low covering factor of the uv emission by xli given the relatively shallow absorption observed in components 2 and 3 ( see figure 4a ) .",
    "since the x - ray emission region is much more compact than the uv blr ( and likely the uv continuum source as well ) , it is reasonable that the same gas would have different line - of - sight covering factors in the two bandpasses .",
    "qualitatively , this is consistent with the inhomogeneous wind model described in detail in the next section , in which denser , lower - ionization regions occupy smaller and smaller volumes in the global outflow . the lowest ionization x - ray species could conceivably come from a region that is sufficiently dense and compact that its presence is not seen against a larger absorber giving the unsaturated .",
    "alternatively , it may imply the xli absorber does not occult the uv absorber at all and that we are seeing physically distinct absorbers in different lines - of - sight in the two bandpasses , thus placing very specific requirements on the absorption  emission geometry .",
    "finally , we compare independent constraints on the distances of the absorbers based on the uv and x - ray analysis . in paper iv , limits on variability in the x - ray absorption",

    "in contrast , a recent study by @xcite reported variations in the fe m - shell unresolved transition array in the _ cxo _ observations , and they derive an upper limit of @xmath16  6  pc for this absorber .",
    "limits can also be derived on the distances for each of the ionization components modeled in paper  iv based on the simple geometrical requirement that @xmath161 .",
    "if the absorbers are uniform , constant density regions , then for a given model solution with parameters @xmath8 - @xmath85 , @xmath162 through their dependences on density .",
    "this gives upper limits on @xmath84 ( lower limit on @xmath87 ) ; results are listed in table  3 . filling factors @xmath1631 would imply more stringent limits on @xmath84 , since the absorbers would then occupy a larger region than given by @xmath164 . the limit on xhi , @xmath151  4",
    "pc , is somewhat less than the distance derived for component 1a based on the * density constraint and uv modeling above ; it is similar to the estimates for uv components 2 and 3 based on the assumption of uniform absorbers , with roughly spherical geometries ( see discussion in  6.1 ) .        with constraints derived on the physical state and geometry of the absorbers",
    ", we now investigate implications for the global model of the outflow in ngc 3783 and explore constraints for dynamical models . in paper iv",
    ", the three ionization components modeled for the x - ray absorption were found to be consistent with being in pressure equilibrium ( @xmath165 ) , all lying on stable regions of the nearly vertical part of the thermal stability curve ( log(@xmath166 ) vs log(@xmath8/@xmath166 ) ; see figure 12 in paper iv ) . based on the modeling above , uv",
    "kinematic components 1b , 2 , and 3 are also at the same pressure .",
    "they occupy the low - temperature base of the region of the thermal stability curve where a range of temperatures can co - exist in pressure equilibrium , coinciding with the solution in log(@xmath166 ) , log(@xmath8/@xmath166 ) for the low ionization x - ray gas , xli , seen in figure 12 in paper iv .",
    "thus , these results are consistent with the general model presented for ngc 3783 in paper  iv , and described theoretically in @xcite , in which the absorption arises in a multi - phase thermal wind , comprised of embedded regions that are inhomogeneous in temperature and density . in this model , the uv absorbers ( and xli ) represent the lowest - ionization , densest material detectable in the spectrum .",
    "these results can be compared further with the recent study by @xcite , which presents a new dynamical model for the x - ray outflow in ngc 3783 that combines some of these general ideas with more specific assumptions and calculations .",
    "the main driver of the flow in this model is thermal gas expansion and the main carrier of the flow is the highest ionization , hottest component .",
    "the model suggests that cooler , lower - ionization material occupies smaller fractions of the flow where the size distribution resembles what is known from the ism .",
    "an inhomogeneous wind model opens the possibility for having different covering fractions for different ionization components that share the same outflow velocity .",
    "it also eases the problem of the large transverse dimension of the x - ray gas in component xli discussed in paper  iv , since the low - ionization components can have large column densities yet they are composed of small filaments or clouds with relatively small dimensions . in the framework of this model ,",
    "@xcite compute the kinetic energy associated with the ngc 3783 outflow to be only a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity , and the mass - loss rate to be comparable to the accretion rate .",
    "the low - ionization , high - velocity uv absorber component  1a does not fit into the picture of inhomogeneities co - existing at pressure equilibrium .",
    "it has a gas pressure that is a factor of ten greater than the other components and thus , if embedded in the more diffuse higher - ionization gas without an additional confining mechanism , will eventually evaporate .",
    "one possibility is that component  1a is comprised of relatively high density material that has recently been swept up from an external mass source and exposed to the ionizing radiation from the agn , and is destined to expand to come into pressure equilibrium with the remainder of the flow .",
    "this absorber was found to have the smallest covering factor , based on the doublet absorption , consistent with this being a dense , compact region in the flow .",
    "perhaps it is embedded in , and evaporating into the more diffuse component 1b gas , which is at pressure equilibrium with the rest of the outflow .",
    "this would explain the dynamical link between these regions implied by the decrease in radial velocity observed in both absorbers ( paper iii ) . if component  1a is unconfined , the timescale for it to expand , with its density decreasing to that of the 1b region , can be approximated based on the estimated size of the absorber ( @xmath167 2@xmath410@xmath115  cm ) and the thermal velocity ( @xmath168  22 km  s@xmath1 at the model temperature of 1.9@xmath410@xmath169  k ) , giving a lifetime of @xmath3 150 years .",
    "alternatively , component 1a ( and all uv absorbers ) could be confined by magnetic pressure , as proposed in some dynamical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "only a moderate field ( @xmath170 10@xmath68  g ) would be required to balance the thermal pressure of this absorber ; general calculations by @xcite show fields of this strength could easily be present at the distance derived for the uv absorbers in ngc 3783 .",
    "the independent appearance of the uv components on yearly timescales , without correlation with the observed continuum flux ( kc01 ) , provides further constraints for physical models of the outflow . in the framework of the thermal wind model described above",
    ", it may be a signature of condensations in the outflow that have appeared in our line - of - sight to the agn .",
    "however , we note these timescales for the appearance of absorption components are quite short compared with the evaporation timescale derived for component 1a above",
    ". alternatively , it may be due to motion of the uv absorbers across our sightline , as discussed in kc01 and paper iii . in this scenario ,",
    "dynamical models must account for the implied transverse component of velocity ( @xmath171 500 km  s@xmath1 , kc01 ; paper iii ) , at the @xmath3 10 pc distance scale , as well as the radial velocity for the uv absorbers .",
    "additionally , the decreasing radial velocity observed in component  1 must be explained , consistently for both subcomponents 1a and 1b .",
    "if this is due to a geometrical effect , in which the absorber is following a curved path across our line - of - sight , it provides constraints on its trajectory and kinematics ( see paper iii ) .",
    "finally , the combined uv and x - ray results on the outflow geometry and kinematics may provide additional constraints .",
    "if all ionization components are roughly co - located , then the gas giving rise to the uv absorbers would occupy a much smaller region than the high - ionization material seen in the x - ray .",
    "if the uv absorption components are single uniform clouds , it may be difficult to account for the similarity in outflow velocities for the full range of ionization seen in the two bandpasses ; it would require three small , localized regions ( the uv absorbers ) span the full kinematic range of the much more extended global outflow corresponding to the higher ionization gas .",
    "one possibility is that the individual components have low internal filling factors , so that the lower - ionization gas we see is distributed over a larger volume , rather than localized to the small region implied by @xmath164 derived above .",
    "another potential explanation is that the gas is not co - located ( e.g. , see discussion in  6.2 ) .",
    "this could be explained , for example , by dynamical models that predict the terminal velocities of flow regions will depend on the launch radius of the outflow , such as the mhd wind models presented in @xcite ; in this framework , it is possible that gas with a range of physical conditions and at different locations would have similar terminal velocities .      here",
    "we explore a potential connection between the uv absorbers and the optical  uv line emission . in a recent study",

    "<S> we present results on the location , physical conditions , and geometry of the outflow in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 from a study of the variable intrinsic uv absorption . </S>",
    "<S> based on analysis of 18 observations with the space telescope imaging spectrograph aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ and 6 observations with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ obtained between 2000 february and 2002 january , we obtain the following results : 1 ) the lowest - ionization species detected in each of the three strong kinematic components ( components 1  3 at radial velocities @xmath01350 , @xmath0550 , and @xmath0725 km  s@xmath1 , respectively ) varied , with equivalent widths inversely correlated with the continuum flux . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the ionization structure in the absorbers responded to changes in the photoionizing flux , with variations occurring over the weekly timescales sampled by our observations . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) a multi - component model of the line - of - sight absorption covering factors , which includes an unocculted narrow emission - line region ( nlr ) and separate covering factors derived for the broad line region and continuum emission sources , predicts saturation in several lines , consistent with the lack of observed variability in these lines . </S>",
