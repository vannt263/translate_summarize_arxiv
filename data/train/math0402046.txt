    "define the following configuration space of points in @xmath468 : @xmath469 the action of the 3-dimensional group @xmath230 on @xmath470 ( see section 2 ) can be continued to an action on @xmath471 .",

    "we compactify the space @xmath78 which is 3-dimensional .",
    "we call the space @xmath55 the _ 3-dimensional eye _ by the analogy with the kontsevich eye ( [ k1 ] , sect .",
    "the propagator constructed below will be a form ( with singularities ) on the 3-dimensional eye .",
    "on the other hand , this simplest example illustrates ( the all ) new ideas which appear in the compactification of the extended kontsevich spaces .",
    "we describe all strata of codimension 1 in @xmath95 in the next subsection .",
    "we consider an oriented pair of points @xmath478 in @xmath472 . then using the action of the group @xmath230 we can fix one of them , say @xmath479 .",
    "then we suppose that @xmath480 and there is no group action .",
    "then we should compactify the space @xmath481 it is easy to compactify near the point @xmath482 : we just cut - off a sphere around this point .",
    "the other boundary components arise when the point @xmath483 tends to @xmath288 .",
    "let us describe them :    first consider the case when the point @xmath483 tends to infinity when the coordinate @xmath75 is finite .",
    "consider the projection @xmath484 .",
    "the the two lines ( for the values @xmath485 and @xmath486 are the coordinate axis ( see figure 8 below ) .",
    "the degenerations of codimension 1 are then the configurations when _ only one _ among the two coordinates after the projection tends to infinity . they are `` separated '' by faces of codimension 2 when the both coordinates @xmath487 tend to @xmath288 .",
    "let us explain how we compute the dimension of the strata : when one coordinate tends to @xmath288 , it is defined only up to a finite summand .",
    "therefore the only coordinates on the moduli is another coordinate on the plane ( after the projection ) , and the coordinate @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the strata of codimension 1 are `` separated '' by the strata of codimension 2 corresponding to the cases when both @xmath487 tend to @xmath288 .",
    "more precisely , they are separated by the lines @xmath488 and @xmath489 in figure 8 .",
    "thus , we have 4 faces of codimension 1 which are corresponded to the following 4 cases :    * @xmath490 , @xmath491 is finite ( positive or negative ) , * @xmath492 , @xmath493 is finite ( positive or negative ) , * @xmath494 , @xmath491 is finite ( positive or negative ) , * @xmath495 , @xmath493 is finite ( positive or negative ) .",
    "these are the all strata of codimension 1 .",
    "there are 6 strata of codimension 2 .",

    "the last 2 faces of codimension 2 are obtained when @xmath75 tends to 0 and to @xmath288 .",
    "we show these strata in figure 8 .",
    "finally , the 3-dimensional eye is the tetrahedron without a small ball inside ( corresponded to the case when @xmath483 is close to @xmath482 ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "we designated the strata of codimension 1 in figure 9 .",
    "we define a propagator 2-form as a _ closed _ 2-form @xmath496 _ with singularities _ on the 3-dimensional eye such that :    * the form @xmath496 has singularities only at the edge @xmath497 of the tetrahedron , * the restriction of the form @xmath496 to the 2-dimensional sphere ( around the point @xmath482 ) is the volume form on the sphere normalized such that the integral over the sphere is equal to 1 , * the restriction of the form @xmath496 to the other boundary components ( besides the sphere and the interval @xmath497 ) is 0 , * the singularity at the edge @xmath497 has the form described below .    consider the rectangle @xmath498 which is the horizontal section of the tetrahedron by the plane @xmath499 where @xmath75 is close to 0 ( see figure 9 ) .",

    "notice that the propagator 2-form should be not defined when @xmath510 , there we have the propagator 1-form which is , by definition , the 1-form @xmath511 where @xmath507 is as above .",
    "so , the above description is _ not _ a description at @xmath485 , but when @xmath503 .",
    "let us prove that such a propagator 2-form exists ( it is more or less clear that if it exists it is defined up to a homotopy in an appropriate sense ) :    consider the part of the 3-dimensional eye which is above the rectangle @xmath498 ( see figure 9 ) , where @xmath75 is a sufficiently small number ( it is important only that the cute - off sphere is above it ) .",
    "we call this part the _ truncated _ 3-dimensional eye .",
    "we say that a map of the truncated 3-dimensional eye to the 2-dimensional sphere @xmath512 is _ spherical _ it maps the sphere inside the tetrahedron homotetically to the sphere @xmath512 , maps all the boundary of the truncated tetrahedron _ except _ the rectangle @xmath498 to a point @xmath513 , and it maps the domain @xmath514 to the sphere @xmath512 and @xmath515 to the point @xmath513 such that the factor - space @xmath516 maps isomorphically to @xmath512 in the way compatible with the orientation . here",
    "the domain @xmath324 is any domain like it is shown in figure 10 .",
    "it should be any simply - connected domain having a non - empty intersection with @xmath517 .",
    "it is clear that such a map exists and is homotopically unique .",
    "then , starting with a spherical map , we can easily construct a propagator 2-form .",
    "first , define it on the truncated rectangle as @xmath518 where @xmath519 is a spherical map , and @xmath341 is the volume form on @xmath512 normalized such that @xmath520 .",
    "then consider the cone which is the complement to the truncated tetrahedron in the tetrahedron , and continue the propagator form to a form with singularities in a natural way",
    ". we should be careful about the smoothness of the form , but it is possible to make it smooth .",
    "then we define the propagator 1-form at the edge @xmath497 as follows : we consider the direct image of the restriction of the propagator 2-form on @xmath498 with respect to the projection of @xmath498 to the @xmath521 .      here",
    "we define a compactification @xmath95 of the space @xmath38 .",

    "we know how to compactify each space in the right - hand side .",
    "it is the 3-dimensional eye for @xmath78 , and a part of the 3-dimensional eye ( which we imbed into the 3-dimensional eye ) for @xmath529 .",
    "then we can imbed each space in the r.h.s to its compactifacation , and then take the closure of the image in this imbedding .",
    "this is , by definition , our compactification @xmath95 .    in the kontsevich paper on deformation quantization ,",
    "one also can compactify the space @xmath49 in this way .",
    "but for a pair of inner points we should consider the corresponding point of the kontsevich eye .",
    "kontsevich attached just the corresponding angle for a pair of inner points . in this way",
    ", he does not get an imbedding , and therefore automatically he gets a wrong compactifacation , which does not coincide with his right compactification described in the terms of trees .",
    "when one considers a point of the kontsevich eye instead of the corresponding angle , we get the right described in trees compactification .",
    "we claim the following lemma :    * the space @xmath95 is naturally a manifold with corners , * the projection @xmath531 can be uniquely continued to a map @xmath532 which is a map of manifolds with corners .",
    "now we describe all strata of codimension 1 in @xmath95 .",
    "we define the dimension `` of a point '' as follows : it is equal to @xmath292 if we need to know @xmath533",
    "1-dimensional 4-point ratios , @xmath534 3-dimensional 4-point ratios , @xmath535 , and this number can be not made less .",
    "the images with respect to @xmath536 of the strata of codimension 1 in @xmath95 are either the stratum of codimension 0 in @xmath46 ( we call these strata of codimension 1 in @xmath95 _ the strata of codimension 1 of the first type _ ) , or are strata of codimension 1 in @xmath46 ( we call them _ the strata of codimension 1 of the second type _ ) .",

    ".    _ strata of codimension 1 of the second type _    * a typical stratum is drawn in figure  7 .",
    "the reader should remember that the two lines are _ crossing _ ( that means two lines in a 3-dimensional space which do not intersect ) . on these two boundary lines we have",
    "exactly the picture from figure 2 .",
    "the points inside the circle * a * are in finite distances everywhere .",
    "the points inside the circles * b * and * c * are infinitely far to the right and to the left from the circle * a*. when we apply an infinite shift to the circle * b * the points inside it will be everywhere in the finite distances , the same is true for the circle * c*. ( remember that the boundary lines are _ crossing _ ! ) . on the lower line we have several groups of points infinitely close to each other , the distances between the groups are finite . the lower and the upper infinities have the same order .",
    "when we apply the transform @xmath539 for infinite @xmath75 to figure  7 , the lower line will look like the upper , and vise versa .",
    "it was a remarkable insight of maxim kontsevich that the lines should be crossing .",
    "consider the projection @xmath532 .",
    "let @xmath341 be a smooth differential form ( not necessarily closed ) on @xmath95 .",

    "let @xmath341 be a differential form on @xmath559 , we denote by @xmath563 the direct image which is the integral of @xmath341 along the fiber @xmath175 .",

    "suppose that we have a collection of open manifolds @xmath867 and of their compactifications @xmath916 which all are manifold with corners such that any face of codimension @xmath592 is a product of @xmath917 different @xmath311 s ( maybe these are not the most right conditions for the description in general ) .",
    "then when we compute the boundary operator @xmath918 we get a quadratic expression in @xmath311 s which is the sum over the all strata of codimension 1 . then",
    "suppose we have a stratum of codimension 1 of @xmath867 which is a product @xmath919 . how to compute the boundary @xmath920 ?",
    "the most natural is to suppose that the leibniz rule for @xmath921 holds .",
    "( of course , we have in mind that the strata are labeled by some combinatorial objects like trees , and the leibniz rule should be understood in this sense ) .",
    "for example , in the case of stasheff polyhedra the leibniz rule holds .",
    "suppose we have something like an `` algebraic representation '' of the family @xmath922 .",
    "it means that we associate to each space @xmath867 a graded vector space @xmath923 and to each stratum of codimension 1 an operation on @xmath924 .",
    "suppose that these operations are compatible with the boundary operations .",
    "the latter means that if a stratum @xmath925 can be obtained by a `` degeneration of codimension 1 '' from a stratum @xmath199 , and a stratum @xmath926 can be obtained by a degeneration of codimension 1 from a stratum @xmath925 , then it implies that the corresponding compositions can be also obtained functorially one from another .",
    "_ then the jacobi identity is an immediate consequence of the leibniz rule for the boundary operator _ @xmath921 .",

    "it follows from the identity @xmath927 for the boundary operator .",
    "but we can imagine the situation when the leibniz rule is not satisfied .",
    "for instance , it could be an operator of the second order .",
    "it means that to compute the boundary of any stratum we need to know the boundaries of strata of codimension 0 and of strata of codimension 1 .",
    "then the jacobi identity will be replaced by a more complicated structure .",
    "probably , it will be an odd vector field @xmath31 on @xmath928 $ ] such that @xmath929 ( not @xmath33 as in the @xmath0-case ) .",
    "consider the space @xmath46 constructed in the paper .",
    "we canonically identify a boundary stratum @xmath199 of codimension 1 with a product of two spaces of different type , @xmath930 .",
    "then we compute the boundary of @xmath199 of codimension 1 .",
    "probably , for the spaces @xmath931 and @xmath932 the leibniz rule is satisfied .",
    "the map @xmath933 is an imbedding .",
    "but the canonical extension @xmath934 is _ not _ an imbedding . in particular",
    ", it maps the boundary of codimension 1 to the boundary of @xmath199 of codimension 1 surjectively , but it contracts some components to points . therefore ,",
    "the leibniz rule is satisfied modulo these components .",

    "<S> it is explained what part of this project is realized here .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , let us recall the definitions . a ( co)associative bialgebra @xmath2 is a vector space endowed with two operations , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , called the product and the coproduct , correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> these operations should obey the following 3 axioms :    * @xmath7 for any @xmath8 ( the associativity ) , * @xmath9 for any @xmath10 ( the coassociativity ) , * @xmath11 for any @xmath12 ( the compatibility )    ( here in the r.h.s . of ( iii ) </S>",

    "<S> notice that a ( co)associative bialgebra could not have the ( co)unit and the antipode .    in the case of an associative algebra @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> there is the well - known construction of the hochschild cohomological complex @xmath16 and the gerstenhaber bracket on it which makes @xmath16 a dg lie algebra . </S>",
    "<S> this dg lie algebra plays a fundamental role in the deformation theory of associative algebras . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the deformation functor associated with this dg lie algebra describes the deformations of the algebra @xmath2 in the class of associative algebras ( more precisely , it describes the deformations of the category of @xmath2-modules ) . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , it means that for a cochain @xmath17 the maurer - cartan equation @xmath18=0\\ ] ] in @xmath16 is equivalent that the product @xmath19 is again associative ( see , e.g. [ k1 ] for details ) .    </S>",

    "<S> the theorem that any lie bialgebra can be quantized was proven without explicit formulas in [ ek ] .    in the present paper </S>",

    "<S> the analog of @xmath37 is the stasheff space @xmath39 where the 2-dimensional group @xmath40 is the group of transformations @xmath41    actually , the whole deformation theory of associative algebras is contained in the geometry of the stasheff compactification @xmath42 of the spaces @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the chain operad @xmath44 in the realization by the stasheff cells is free and is a minimal model of the operad @xmath45 of associative algebras . </S>",
    "<S> then , the application of the markl s construction from [ m1 ] to this minimal model gives exactly the hochschild complex with the gerstenhaber bracket .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we have not so nice description for our compactification @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we hope to understand the geometry of this compactification better in next papers . </S>",
    "<S> now we have the description of all strata of codimension 1 . just notice here that it is _ not _ the croc compactification from [ sh1 ] we suppose to be related with the unexisted theory of non - commutative deformations , but rather a stasheff - type compactification . in particular , it is exactly the stasheff compactification when @xmath47 or @xmath48 .    in the case of associative algebras , an approach alternative to the explicit description of the chain operad as a minimal model ( and which gives much more strong results ) </S>",
    "<S> is the kontsevich approach [ k1 ] . </S>",

    "<S> kontsevich gives in [ k1 ] from this compactification a rigorous description of some particular case of the aksz model of topological quantum field theory on an open disk . </S>",
    "<S> for this , he constructs an appropriate `` propagator '' as a closed 1-form on @xmath54 . within this approach , </S>",
    "<S> the stokes formula gives `` some relation '' even if we would not know about the gerstenhaber bracket . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the gerstenhaber bracket is the only one which makes this equation to be a formality equation .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we follow the kontsevich approach . </S>",
    "<S> we extend our compactification of the 1-dimensional configuration space @xmath37 to a compactification of a 3-dimensional configuration space @xmath38 ( which is the analog of the upper half - plane in the case of associative algebras ) . </S>",
    "<S> we construct all ingredients of a model of the 3-dimensional topological quantum filed theory from this compactification . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a propagator as a closed 2-form _ with singularities _ on @xmath55 which degenerates to a closed 1-form in some limit </S>",
    "<S> . then we associate some closed forms ( with singularities ) to the admissible graphs and apply the stokes formula .    in this way </S>",

    "<S> the definition of @xmath56 itself depends on our compactification @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> the stokes formula gives an equation which we would like to interpret as the `` formality of @xmath0-morphism '' . </S>",
    "<S> the further research should shed some light to this claim .    the good problems ( if you like , it is a definition of a good problem ) in mathematics are valuable not only by themselves , but mostly by new ideas which appear when one tries to solve them . </S>",
    "<S> the author is sure that deformation theory of ( co)associative bialgebras is a good problem . </S>",
    "<S> as far this problem is still not solved , one can expect that it will grow many further ideas . </S>",
    "<S> from this point of view the main idea of this paper is the introduction of the complex @xmath57 . probably , the problem studied here is the first problem where the introduction of it is really necessarily . </S>",
    "<S> we formulated conjectures 1,2 in section 1 which formalize which properties we need from this structure in a possible greater generality . </S>",
    "<S> we think that technically the introduction of this bicomplex is the main new thing invented in the paper .    the goal of this paper is to construct a deformation theory for ( co)associative bialgebras . </S>",
    "<S> according to general principles , it means that we are looking for a dg lie algebra ( or , more generally , for an @xmath0 algebra ) controlling the deformation theory of a ( co)associative bialgebra . in the case of the deformation theory of associative algebras , </S>",
    "<S> such a dg lie algebra controlling the deformations of an associative algebra @xmath2 , is the cohomological hochschild complex of @xmath2 with the gerstenhaber bracket . </S>",
    "<S> ( more precisely , this hochschild complex controls the deformations of the category of @xmath2-modules ) .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , recall that a ( co)associative bialgebra is a vector space @xmath2 equipped with the maps @xmath58 ( the product ) and @xmath6 ( the coproduct ) . the product is supposed to be associative and the coproduct is supposed to be coassociative . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we suppose the following compatibility of them : @xmath59 for any @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> ( here in the r.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> the product is the component product in @xmath14 defined as @xmath60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that we do not suppose the existence of unit and counit in @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> here we meet our first difficulty : the r.h.s . of ( [ eq230.1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is of the 4th degree and not quadratic . </S>",
    "<S> recall that ( little bit roughly ) we associate the deformation theory with a dg lie algebra @xmath61 as follows : we consider the solutions of the maurer - cartan equation @xmath62=0\\ ] ] for @xmath63 modulo the action of the gauge group associated with @xmath64 on these solutions . </S>",
    "<S> ( because of possible divergences in the action of the gauge group , we say instead of this direct construction that the deformation functor is a functor from the category of the artinian algebras to the category of sets ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the gerstenhaber - schack complex [ gs ] associated with a bialgebra @xmath2 is a deformation complex of the bialgebra structure on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the first cohomology of this complex are isomorphic to the infinitesimal deformations on @xmath2 . to pass from the infinitesimal deformations to the global ones </S>",
    "<S> , one needs to have an appropriate dg lie algebra structure on the gerstenhaber - schack complex ( or , more generally , an @xmath0-structure ) . </S>",
    "<S> recall here that as a vector space , the gerstenhaber - schack complex of @xmath2 is @xmath65\\ ] ]    in particular , in degree 1 we have : @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we could expect that for some dg lie algebra structure on @xmath67 the maurer - cartan equation ( [ eq230.2 ] ) for the element @xmath68 means exactly that @xmath69 defines a new ( co)associative bialgebra structure on @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> but it is impossible : because the r.h.s </S>",
    "<S> . of the equation ( [ eq230.1 ] ) is of the 4th degree in @xmath70 and @xmath71 , while the maurer - cartan equation ( [ eq230.2 ] ) is quadratic . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the best we could expect is to have an @xmath0 algebra structure on @xmath67 ( which looks quite complicated ) . </S>",
    "<S> this crucial observation was explained to the author by boris tsygan about 3 years ago .    </S>",
    "<S> this idea is one source of the theory developed here in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> another source is the kontsevich spaces @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the reader can find the definition of them in section 2 of the paper . </S>",
    "<S> the original kontsevich motivation when he invented these spaces was the following : the space @xmath72 is the configuration space on two independent lines , we have 2 points in each line modulo independent common shift on each line , and modulo the following action of @xmath73 on this space : for @xmath74 , we dilatate the first line with the scale @xmath75 and the second with the coefficient @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath72 is a 1-dimensional space : we have an interval on the first line , an interval on the second ( we identify the intervals of the same length ) , and we identify such two configurations with the same product of the lengths of the two intervals . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the configuration has the only one module  the product of the lengths of the intervals . before compactification </S>",
    "<S> , it is isomorphic to @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we compactify the space @xmath72 to the closed interval . </S>",
    "<S> the two limit configurations are shown in the figure 1 :    the kontsevich s insight was that the left picture should give the left - hand side of the compatibility equation ( [ eq230.1 ] ) , while the right picture should give the right - hand side of ( [ eq230.1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we say `` should give '' having in mind a construction of the type of kontsevich formality ( see sections 3 - 4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us outline the line of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we think that the spaces @xmath37 and their 3-dimensional extensions @xmath38 introduced by maxim kontsevich are geniously remarkable and should play the crucial role in the subject . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main technical achievements of this paper is the construction of the stasheff - type compactification of these spaces . in the simplest case of @xmath78 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a 3-dimensional analog of `` the eye '' of kontsevich [ k1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a propagator as a 2-form _ with singularities _ on the 3-dimensional eye . in some limit </S>",
    "<S> we obtain after the integration a 1-form which is also a part of the propagator . </S>",
    "<S> then we construct from this propagator differential forms associated with admissible graphs . </S>",
    "<S> using all these data , we construct the components @xmath79 $ ] where @xmath80 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] where @xmath4 is a finite - dimensional vector space and @xmath3 is the symmetric algebra ( considered as free commutative cocommutative bialgebra ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath82 as the poisson lie algebra ( the poisson lie algebra of functions on @xmath83\\oplus v^*[1]$ ] where the even symplectic structure is given by the canonical pairing of @xmath4 and @xmath84 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then consider an element @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the maurer - cartan equation @xmath86=0 $ ] in the graded lie algebra @xmath82 is equivalent to the condition that @xmath87 defines a lie bialgebra structure on @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> we found using the stokes theorem the family of relations on all @xmath88 which we call the formality relations . </S>",
    "<S> we do not know it is the formality of which structure on @xmath89 , it is a subject for the further research . </S>",
    "<S> but to know these formality relations is enough to quantize any lie bialgebra structure on @xmath4 in the sense of the etingof - kazhdan theorem . </S>",
    "<S> it means that we write down explicitly a ( co)associative bialgebra structure on @xmath90 depending formally on two parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    in section 1 </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the concept of @xmath93prop . </S>",
    "<S> it would be better to call this concept @xmath94prop-@xmath94croc , by for simplicity we use the name @xmath93prop . </S>",
    "<S> this concept is not necessarily for the sequel but it is natural to describe the stasheff - type compactification of the spaces @xmath37 using the concept of @xmath93prop . </S>",
    "<S> we do it in section 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the first two sections are inserted from [ sh2 ] ( we just added the last example in section 2 ) for the convenience of the reader . in section 3 </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the extended kontsevich space @xmath38 and construct its compactification @xmath95 . in particular , we construct the 3-dimensional eye @xmath96 and construct the non - homogeneous propagator differential form on it . in section 4 </S>",
    "<S> we construct the components @xmath88 and prove the formality relation . </S>",
    "<S> also we consider the particular case which gives an explicit formula for the etingof - kazhdan quantization .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]      here we define our main technical tool@xmath93props . </S>",
    "<S> the name @xmath93props indicates that this concept is a further generalization ( or simplification ) of the concept of @xmath94prop due to maxim kontsevich ( see [ k3 ] , [ mv ] ) .    </S>",

    "<S> 3 @xmath287 points on the upper line move infinitely close to each other , and the `` scale '' of this infinitely small number is irrelevant ( we have in mind here the croc compactification from [ sh ] where this scale is relevant ) , @xmath442 . in figure 4 </S>",

    "<S> the stratum in figure 5 is isomorphic to @xmath447 . </S>",
    "<S> let us explain the last formula : the distances between the points at the upper line are infinite , but their ratios are finite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we should count these ratios . for this </S>",

    "<S> ( see the fragments 1 ) and 2 ) in figure 7 . </S>",
    "<S> the second operation is of codimension 0 when @xmath48 .    to go further </S>",
