    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     different results are seen entirely in the ` o2 ` column , with options that decreased energy consumption on top of ` o1 ` have little or the opposite effect when applied on top of ` o2 ` .",
    "this unpredictability suggests that these options have many interdependencies that are difficult to predict up front .",
    "it also makes choosing an optimal set of optimisations very challenging .",
    "therefore , one of our findings is that it is very unlikely that any accurate prediction mechanism for considering an optimisation and its effect on a target system exists : the effect will always be highly dependent on the application to be used and the platform upon which it resides .",
    "the existing collections of optimisations at the various levels do a good job of optimising for performance , and consequently , energy .",
    "these strike a good balance between ease of use and performance .",
    "however , they will never be as effective as those generated by searching through the full optimisation space . to avoid running many tests to find a good solution ,",
    "developing machine - learning compiler technologies similar to milepost gcc  @xcite would be fitting .",
    "a reasonable set of optimisations can be predicted based on high - level features and an architecture selection , and this would greatly reduce the time spent searching as demonstrated by milepost gcc .",
    "this is especially true as the effectiveness and type of optimisation was found to be heavily based on the platform and the structure of the application being compiled ( sect .",
    "[ sect : universality_flags ] ) . predicting the optimisations in this way would reduce compile times as well as the energy and execution time of the application .",
    "this study focused on gcc , since it is a mature compiler supporting many different platforms and optimisations .",
    "as an alternative , the llvm compiler  @xcite is relatively new , with a well defined set of optimisation passes , whose order can easily be specified .",
    "this extra flexibility means there may be a better solution to find , but also that it is essentially searching for a sharper needle in a bigger haystack  @xcite .",
    "the benefits from having this much larger space to explore may not be worth the trade - off of the time it takes to find it .",
    "when designing a new optimisation , a compiler writer must check whether the optimisation is effective , and under what conditions . using fractional factorial , design",
    "a compiler writer can check whether the pass is effective when combined with an arbitrary set of other optimisations .",
    "this avoids the case of the optimisation being tested in isolation , which will result in an incorrect analysis because of the interactions between optimisations .",
    "we would recommend that , when selecting optimisations to be included in a broad optimisation level , the optimisation is evaluated in this way and only selected if it has a non - negative effect over all of the benchmarks .",
    "all the optimisations we show in this paper are designed for either performance or code size .",
    "this means we can not draw conclusions about the effect of dedicated compiler optimisations targeting energy such as those shown in the related work ( sect .  [ subsect : energyoptimisations ] ) .",
    "although all optimisation targets may be beneficial for energy usage , dedicated energy flags would have to compete against these other optimisation metrics , meaning that even if they operate well in isolation , they may not do well when grouped .",
    "there are many opportunities for further work in this area .",
    "the first hypothesis of energy consumption and execution time being correlated in the general case was found to be correct across many platforms and benchmarks .",
    "this was first shown to be true by the high level results , showing only the overall optimisation levels .",
    "the more detailed fractional factorial design runs also demonstrated this result , showing that most optimisations had the same relative effect on energy and time .",
    "this result occurs because the majority of optimisations focus on reducing the total amount of work performed by the benchmarks  thus minimising both energy consumption and execution time .    by adding and subtracting individual flags on top of the whole optimisation levels we have shown that a better set of flags exists , which can produce more optimal applications",
    "this validates our second hypothesis , giving results in line with much previous work .",
    "the third hypothesis stated that it was possible to efficiently search the optimisation space to gain information about the effectiveness of each optimisation . to perform this we leveraged fractional factorial designs , allowing us to test each optimisation in a greatly reduced number of runs .",
    "this method allowed us to explore complex effects seen on the cortex - a8 , where the simd unit helped achieve lower energy consumption .",
    "the fourth hypothesis of there being no optimisation which was effective for all benchmarks and platforms was evaluated using fractional factorial designs .",
    "we were able to extract the most effective optimisations for each benchmark and platform pair and these results showed that there was no single optimisation that was universally effective .",
    "further analysis of adding and subtracting individual flags showed that the optimisation space is chaotic , with optimisations interacting in unpredictable ways .",
    "the compiler writer can use these results and the fractional factorial design method to evaluate potential optimisation passes , ensuring that they perform well in a variety of configurations . until a method for resolving the interactions between optimisations",
    "is found , it is envisioned that the developer could use this technique to eliminate optimisations that are not having a positive effect on their application .",
    "this will speed up compilation time as well as potentially improving the performance of their application .",
    "this study was funded by embecosm .",
    "the original research proposal was a result of the energy aware computing ( eaco ) workshops at the university of bristol , sponsored by the institute for advanced studies .",
    "the first author was partly sponsored by epsrc s doctoral training account ep / k502996/1 .",
    "all the measurements were taken using the ina219 power monitoring ic  @xcite , which provides power , current and voltage outputs .",
    "the cortex - m0 and cortex - m3 boards both have a single measurement point , recording the power consumed by the whole microprocessor . for the beaglebone",
    "there are three available measurement points : the cortex - a8 core ( including caches ) , on - chip peripherals ( power management , bus controllers ) and the external sdram memory ic .",
    "this allows the effect of the compiler optimisations on the memory to be recorded .",
    "adapteva s epiphany board has two measurement points : the core power consumption and io power consumption , whereas the xmos board s measurement point gathers power consumption data for the core of the processor .",
    "the hardware measurements have several sources of error .",
    "the most apparent errors are variations in the timing : the ina219 is sampled at intervals of 1  ms and the power measurement integrated over this .",
    "small inaccuracies occur from jitter in this interval .",
    "the adc in the ina219 also fluctuated by @xmath130  @xmath2 , however this was close to the noise floor of the measurements , so had no significant effect on the results .",
