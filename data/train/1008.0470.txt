    "one of the most important predictions of general relativity is black hole .",
    "numerous studies have been done on the properties of the black hole and the formation by gravitational collapse .",
    "the theory of gravitational collapse was initiated in 1939 by oppenheimer and snyder @xcite as a spherical contraction model of a uniformly distributed dust star .",
    "the standard method in @xcite is making a physically reasonable junction of the two different spacetimes corresponding to the interior and exterior regions of the collapsing body .",
    "the interior dust solution is given by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric in the synchronous comoving coordinates .",
    "we impose a junction condition at the surface of the star so that the solution connects smoothly to the exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "the interior and exterior solutions are described in different coordinate systems .",
    "although it is nothing wrong to construct solutions in such a manner , one can not describe the dynamics of the collapsing star in terms of the coordinates of the observer outside the event horizon .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to describe the both regions inside and outside the horizon by a single coordinate system in a physical way .",
    "the painlev - gullstrand coordinates used in this paper is , in fact , the key to a simple physical picture of black hole and gravitational collapse .",
    "it was first introduced by painlev @xcite and gullstrand @xcite in 1921 .",
    "we leave the details of its history to @xcite , but mention here only its notable properties .",
    "unlike the schwarzschild form , the painlev - gullstrand metric tensor has an off - diagonal element so that it is regular at the schwarzschild radius and has a singularity only at the origin of the spherical coordinates . in other words , the surfaces @xmath0 traverse the event horizon to reach the singularity .",
    "therefore , the painlev - gullstrand coordinates are convenient for exploring the geometry of collapsing star and black hole both inside and outside the horizon altogether by a single coordinate patch .",
    "moreover , the space given by the painlev - gullstrand coordinates can be intuitively regarded as a river whose speed of current is the newtonian escape velocity at each point @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the current hits the speed of light at the event horizon and then inside it there is nothing one can do to get sucked into the center of the hole .",
    "this feature results from the fact that this coordinate system adopts a time coordinate as measured by an observer who is at rest at infinity and freely falls straightforward to the origin .",
    "this physical picture provides a starting point of a method to describe gravitational collapse . in the present work ,",
    "we generalize the painlev - gullstrand metric to incorporate gravitational collapse .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : painleve ] we introduce generalized painlev - gullstrand coordinates with the time coordinate being the proper time of a free - falling observer . in sec .",
    "[ sec : flat ] we solve the einstein equation in the interior region of a spherical collapsing star of uniform perfect fluid , while in the exterior region the metric is given by the standard painlev - gullstrand form . in sec .",
    "[ sec : closed ] we see the correspondence of the collapse from a finite radius and the model by oppenheimer and snyder .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in the case of spherical symmetry without charge , black holes are described by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "the standard schwarzschild coordinates @xmath1 are valid only outside the event horizon .",
    "however , the painlev - gullstrand coordinates @xmath2 enable us to describe also the inside of the horizon as well as the outside in a single patch of the coordinates .    in this section",
    ", we derive the generalized painlev - gullstrand coordinates .",
    "we say here `` generalized '' in the sense that we introduce free - falling observers who start not only from infinity but also from other general points .",
    "the following mathematical derivation of the generalized painlev - gullstrand coordinates is close to the derivation in @xcite , but the physical situation and the time coordinate are different .",
    "the time coordinate @xmath3 of this family is the proper time @xmath4 of an observer who freely falls radially from rest .",
    "let us start with the schwarzschild metric given in the standard form @xmath5 where @xmath6 . in the schwarzschild spacetime",
    ", the four - velocity @xmath7 of an observer at the spacetime coordinates @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 with @xmath4 being the proper time , which satisfies the normalization condition @xmath10 note that the energy per unit rest mass of a test particle , @xmath11 is a constant of motion since @xmath12 is the timelike killing field .",
    "then the four - velocity @xmath7 can be explicitly written as @xmath13 and @xmath14 since we choose the painlev - gullstrand time coordinate @xmath15 as the proper time of the free - falling observer , the geodesic is orthogonal to the surfaces @xmath16 and the geodesic tangent vector @xmath17 is equal to the gradient of @xmath15 : @xmath18 that is to say , @xmath19 consequently , the painlev - gullstrand metric takes the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is radially free - falling velocity .",
    "the observer in geodesic motion have the normalized four - velocity @xmath22 note that the metric form ( [ gpg ] ) is different from that given by martel and poisson @xcite , for our time coordinate is @xmath23 times larger than theirs .",
    "this is because our metric is characterized by the free fall from various points at rest , while theirs by the free fall from infinity at various initial velocities .",
    "the important point to note is that the metric ( @xmath24 ) indicates an analogue of the conservation of energy in the newtonian mechanics , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a conserved energy and @xmath27 is a gravitational potential energy of a central force field . in particular ,",
    "if the particle freely falls from rest at infinity , the conserved energy @xmath28 is zero ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) and the metric ( [ gpg ] ) reduces to the standard form given by painlev and gullstrand : @xmath30 for a free fall from infinity , the radial velocity @xmath31 is the newtonian escape velocity @xmath32 .",
    "it is obvious from the metric ( [ gpg ] ) and ( [ pg ] ) that the painlev - gullstrand coordinates are regular at the horizon @xmath33 .",
    "this enables us to deal with the geometry of black hole both inside and outside the horizon .    in the subsequent sections",
    ", we will consider the solution of the einstein equation with matter .",
    "in general , the energy @xmath28 and the mass @xmath34 are functions of @xmath3 and @xmath35 , not constant values . with the physical picture in mind and motivated by ( [ gpg ] ) , we make the ansatz for the metric in the generalized painlev - gullstrand form @xmath36 where @xmath37 we may note , in passing , that our ansatz is not a particular case of the metric given as a generalized form of the painlev - gullstrand metric by lin and soo @xcite since their metric belongs to the category of the metric in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we solve the einstein equation in the spherical gravitational collapse .",
    "the standard form of the painlev - gullstrand metric gives a straightforward approach to the solution .      according to birkhoff s theorem ,",
    "the schwarzschild solution is the only solution of the vacuum einstein equation for a spherically symmetric spacetime . in particular , even if matter distribution is not static but moving in a spherically symmetric way , the exterior vacuum region is given by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : painleve ] , we can express the schwarzschild metric in the painlev - gullstrand form ( [ pg ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , for the matter solution in the case of the gravitational collapse , the metric is assumed to be of the form @xmath38 that is , the generalized form ( [ gpg ] ) with @xmath39 . in the following discussions ,",
    "the painlev - gullstrand time coordinate is represented by @xmath40 , instead of @xmath3 in sec .",
    "[ sec : painleve ] . inside the spherical star , the einstein equation , @xmath41 , reduces to    [ allequations ] @xmath42    where the dot represents the differentiation with respect to @xmath40 and the prime the differentiation with respect to @xmath35 . from equations ( [ eeq-00 ] ) , ( [ eeq-10 ] ) and ( [ eeq-11 ] )",
    ", there exists an identity , @xmath43 and then only three components of the einstein equation are independent .    for simplicity , we shall take the stress - energy tensor @xmath44 of the perfect fluid : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy density , @xmath47 is the pressure , and @xmath48 is the four - velocity of the matter moving radially . substituting equation ( [ t ] ) into equation ( [ t11 ] ) , we obtain the radial velocity @xmath49 as the escape velocity @xmath50 therefore , the four - velocity @xmath51 describes the radial free fall satisfying @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "since it is clear from equation ( @xmath54 ) that the perfect fluid falls at the escape velocity , the physical picture is also clear ",
    "matter is attracted by the other matter distributed inside it .",
    "integration of equation ( [ eeq-00 ] ) yields the mass function @xmath55 assume that the density has a separable form @xmath56 and that the pressure is given by @xmath57 , where a constant @xmath58 is usually greater than unity .",
    "substitute them into equation ( [ eeq-10 ] ) and impose the conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 , then the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 are obtained , in which @xmath63 and @xmath64 is an integration constant .",
    "thus the matter density of the star is uniform : @xmath65 where @xmath40 takes the value from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , the other components of the einstein equation reduce to a single equation @xmath68 it is consistent with the form that we supposed above .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we consider the simple case of dust ( @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath70 ) to explore the gravitational collapse in greater detail .      in this subsection",
    ", the boundary surface between the interior dust region ( @xmath71 ) and the exterior vacuum region ( @xmath72 ) will be discussed .",
    "let @xmath73 be the surface radius of the star at time @xmath40 and @xmath34 be the mass inside the surface .",
    "it is natural to impose a boundary condition at the surface @xmath74 , that is , the mass , @xmath75 of the star is constant , and then the radius of the boundary is given by @xmath76 this means that the surface of the star is at rest at infinity and its radius monotonically decreases to zero as @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , the motion of the surface is geodesic",
    ".    now that the equation of the surface is determined , we are in a position to verify that the interior and exterior regions are smoothly matched each other . the interior solution @xmath78 given in subsec .",
    "[ sec : einstein - eqs ] has the line element @xmath79 where the interior velocity @xmath80 is interpreted as the hubble contraction flow @xmath81 which is zero at the initial state and diverges at the final stage . at the surface",
    "@xmath74 , this velocity becomes @xmath82 and the interior line element becomes @xmath83 on the other hand , the geometry of the exterior region ( @xmath72 ) is @xmath84 where the exterior velocity @xmath85 is the ordinary escape velocity in the newtonian gravity .",
    "hence when the radius @xmath35 equals @xmath73 , the interior and exterior velocities coincide with each other : @xmath86 and the line element of the exterior is the same as that of the interior : @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , the radial infall velocity @xmath88 of the surface of the star and the radius @xmath73 of it have a relationship @xmath89 this implies that the surface motion is geodesic and the surface velocity hits the speed of light at time @xmath90 .",
    "turning now to the matching of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary surface calculated both inside and outside the surface radius .",
    "since the unit tangent vector to the geodesic curve of dust at the surface is @xmath91 the unit normal vector @xmath92 to the boundary surface is given by @xmath93 which satisfies the orthogonality @xmath94 .",
    "using the normal vector @xmath92 , the extrinsic curvature is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the projection to the surface .",
    "consequently , the components of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary surface are    [ allequations ] @xmath97 @xmath98 and all the others components vanish , especially @xmath99    therefore , the interior region and the exterior region are smoothly matched at the boundary surface @xmath74 , and then we can describe the geometry of all the spacetime by a single coordinate system @xmath100 .      the previous subsec .",
    "[ sec : surface ] focuses on the local property , i.e. , the smoothness of the metrics at the boundary surface . in this subsection",
    ", we study the global structure of spacetime with the collapsing dust considered above .",
    "the painlev - gullstrand coordinates manifestly give a physical picture of the whole spacetime of the gravitational collapse .    the interior solution ( [ in - met ] )",
    "expresses a contracting flat friedmann universe .",
    "the dust region is inside the boundary surface @xmath74 that freely and radially falls at the speed @xmath88 with time @xmath101 . in this region",
    ", there exists the event horizon and the apparent horizon defined by @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the event horizon emerges from the origin @xmath104 at the time @xmath105 and its radius becomes larger until it equals to the surface radius @xmath73 .",
    "the time that the two radii become equal to each other is @xmath90 and the size is @xmath33 , as expected .",
    "after the surface of the star is hidden by the event horizon , the timelike apparent horizon appears at the same intersection .",
    "outside the apparent horizon @xmath106 , surfaces @xmath107 are not timelike but spacelike , and the infall velocity exceeds the speed of light @xmath108 so that this region is a trapped region .",
    "and the contracting dust star collapses into a singularity at @xmath109 , consistent with the singularity theorem .    the whole spacetime diagram for the gravitational collapse",
    "is given by the interior dust region mentioned above and the exterior schwarzschild region in fig .",
    "[ fpenrose ] .",
    "it expresses the dust collapsing from rest at infinity and the eventual black hole .",
    "the dust flat friedmann universe case ( @xmath69 ) for the interior spacetime was investigated in @xcite in the painlev - gullstrand coordinates .",
    "here we have studied the same problem from the new viewpoint of the generalized painlev - gullstrand metric in which physical picture is clear .    the penrose diagram for the collapsing dust star .",

    "in the previous section , we have discussed the description of the spherical gravitational collapse that starts from infinity .",
    "its interior metric ( [ in - met ] ) is expressed by the flat friedmann universe .",
    "however , the standard model of a collapsing star , including the one considered by oppenheimer and snyder @xcite , is collapse from rest at a finite initial radius .",
    "it is not trivial to apply the idea of the painlev - gullstrand coordinates to the situation of the collapse starting with a finite radius .",
    "the standard metric of this type is that of a contracting closed friedmann universe as a @xmath110 solution of an interior dust .",
    "although the similar solution is given by gautreau and cohen @xcite , it is complicated even in the vacuum region since it is given by implicit functions of time and radial coordinates .    in this section ,",
    "we briefly show the solution of the collapse from a finite radius as another particular case of the generalized painlev - gullstrand form ( [ gpg ] ) . to begin with",
    ", we consider the boundary surface that freely falls from rest at a radius @xmath111 . at the surface ,",
    "the conservation law ( [ cl ] ) gives the energy @xmath112 and the infall velocity @xmath113 where @xmath73 is the surface radius smaller than the initial radius @xmath111 .",
    "next , when we assume that the exterior solution ranges from the contracting surface radius @xmath73 to the initial radius @xmath111 ( i.e. , @xmath114 ) , the energy remains the same as ( [ ceb ] ) , @xmath115 and therefore the infall velocity becomes @xmath116 in the exterior region .",
    "the exterior metric is therefore given by @xmath117 finally , in the interior region @xmath118 , since the energy is now a function of time and radius coordinates , we make the ansatz @xmath119 for the energy and @xmath120 for the velocity in the generalized painlev - gullstrand metric ( [ gpg ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath121 ( [ ce+ ] ) and @xmath122 ( [ ce- ] ) coincide with @xmath28 ( [ ceb ] ) , and also that @xmath123 ( [ cv+ ] ) and @xmath124 ( [ cv- ] ) coincide with @xmath88 ( [ cvb ] ) at the surface @xmath74 .    in the case of the uniformly distributed dust",
    ", we can solve the einstein equation taking into account the boundary condition which is the same as that in sec .",
    "[ sec : surface ] .",
    "the mass function reduces to @xmath125 where the surface radius is @xmath126 the time coordinate is @xmath127 and the parameter @xmath128 takes the value from @xmath67 to @xmath129 .",
    "this interior solution @xmath130 expresses the contracting closed friedmann universe . as before",
    ", one can verify that the two metrics corresponding to the interior and exterior solutions smoothly match at the boundary , by using the normal vector @xmath131 namely , the components of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary surface are    [ allequations ] @xmath132 @xmath133    and all the others vanish . the interior velocity ( [ cv- ] ) is also characterized as the hubble contraction flow @xmath81 , just as the velocity ( [ fv- ] ) in the hubble flow in the flat friedmann universe . in fact ,",
    "when the initial radius is large enough to satisfy @xmath134 , the energy and the velocity in the both regions become the same as those of the collapse from infinity .    in the further exterior region @xmath135 , the metric is simply given by the standard schwarzschild form up to the scale of the time coordinate : @xmath136 which smoothly matches with the exterior solution ( [ cm+ ] ) at the boundary @xmath137 .",
