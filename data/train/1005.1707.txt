    "magnetic fields is a key ingredient in present - day star formation .",
    "for example , protostellar jets , which are ubiquitous in star - forming regions , are considered to be driven from protostars by the lorentz force .",
    "protostellar jets influence gas accretion onto protostars and disturb the ambient medium .",
    "in addition , the angular momentum of the cloud is removed by magnetic braking and protostellar jets .",
    "the removal of angular momentum makes protostar formation possible in a parent cloud that has a much larger specific angular momentum than the protostar .",
    "so far , magnetic effects in primordial gas clouds have been ignored in many studies because magnetic fields in the early universe are supposed to be extremely weak .",
    "however , recent studies indicate magnetic fields of moderate strength can exist even in the early universe .",
    "cosmological fluctuations produced magnetic fields before the epoch of recombination @xcite .",
    "these fields were sufficiently large to seed the magnetic fields in galaxies . a generation mechanism for magnetic fields at the epoch of reionization",
    "are also proposed @xcite , in which magnetic fields in intergalactic matter are amplified up to @xmath1 .",
    "these fields can therefore increase up to @xmath2 in the first collapsed object having number density of @xmath3 .",
    "these fields may influence the evolution of primordial gas clouds and formation of population iii stars . under",
    "spherical symmetry including hydrodynamical radiative transfer , many authors have carefully investigated both the present - day ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and primordial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) star formation processes . a significant difference between present - day and",
    "primordial star formation exists in the thermal evolution of the collapsing gas cloud because of differences in the abundance of dust grains and metals . in present - day star formation , the gas temperature in molecular clouds is @xmath4k .",
    "these clouds collapse isothermally for @xmath5 .",
    "then the gas becomes adiabatic at @xmath6 , and an adiabatic core ( or the first core ) forms .",
    "after the dissociation of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath7 ) , the protostar forms at @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , primordial gas clouds have temperatures of @xmath9k at @xmath10 @xcite . these clouds collapse keeping polytropic index @xmath11 for a long range of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the first core does not appear in the primordial collapsing cloud .",
    "after the central density reaches @xmath7 , the thermal evolution of the primordial collapsing cloud begins to coincide with that of a present - day cloud @xcite .",
    "the difference in thermal evolution between present - day and primordial clouds arises when @xmath13 .",
    "another major difference between present - day and primordial star formation exists in their magnetic evolution . in present - day star formation",
    ", neutral gas is well - coupled with ions for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while the magnetic field dissipates by ohmic dissipation in the range of @xmath16 @xcite . in the collapsing cloud , @xmath17% of the magnetic field",
    "is dissipated for @xmath16 @xcite . on the other hand , in a primordial gas cloud ,",
    "the magnetic field couples strongly with the primordial gas during all phases of the star formation , as long as the initial field strength is weaker than @xmath18 g @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the magnetic field is largely dissipated by ohmic dissipation before protostar formation in present - day clouds , while the magnetic field can continue to be amplified without dissipation in primordial clouds .    the magnetic field in the collapsing cloud is closely related to the fragmentation or formation of binary or multiple stellar systems . in present - day star formation",
    ", the magnetic field strongly suppresses rotation - driven fragmentation @xcite . for primordial clouds , magnetic effects on fragmentation are still unknown . in this study",
    ", we investigate the evolution of weakly magnetized primordial clouds and the formation of population iii stars using three - dimensional simulations .",
    "to calculate the evolution of primordial star - forming clouds in a large dynamic range , we use the three - dimensional ideal mhd nested grid method @xcite . for gas pressure , we use a barotropic relation that approximates the result of one - zone calculation where thermal and chemical processes for primordial gas are solved in detail @xcite .    as the initial state ,",
    "we take a spherical cloud whose density is twice higher than that for hydrostatic equilibrium with external pressure ( bonnor - ebert sphere ) .",
    "the central ( number ) density of the bonnor - ebert sphere is set at @xmath19 .",
    "the initial temperature is set at 250k , and the radius of a bonnor - ebert sphere is @xmath20pc . to promote fragmentation , a small @xmath21-mode density perturbation is imposed on the spherical cloud .",
    "the total mass contained inside @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "the initial cloud rotates around the @xmath24-axis at a uniform angular velocity of @xmath25 , and has a uniform magnetic field @xmath26 parallel to the @xmath24-axis ( or rotation axis ) .",
    "the initial model is characterized by two non - dimensional parameters : the ratios of the rotational energy to the gravitational energy @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and of the magnetic energy to the gravitational energy @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the rotational , magnetic and gravitational energies , respectively .",
    "we made 36 models using different values for these two parameters .",
    "we adopted the nested grid method ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to obtain high spatial resolution near the center .",
    "each level of a rectangular grid has the same number of cells ( @xmath34 ) , with the cell width @xmath35 depending on the grid level @xmath36 .",
    "the cell width is halved with every increment of the grid level .",
    "the highest level of the grid changes dynamically : a new finer grid is generated whenever the minimum local jeans length @xmath37 falls below @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the cell width . the maximum level of grids is restricted to @xmath40 . since the density is highest in the finest grid , generation of a new grid ensures the jeans condition with a safety factor of 2 .",
    "we begin our calculations with three grid levels ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the box size of the initial finest grid @xmath42 is chosen to be @xmath43 , where @xmath22 is the radius of the critical bonnor - ebert sphere . the coarsest grid ( @xmath44 ) then has a box size of @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the cloud evolution before protostar formation ( @xmath46 ) from the initial stage for magnetically - dominated model that has a larger magnetic energy than the rotation energy ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this model has parameters of ( @xmath29 , @xmath27 ) = ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , and the initial cloud has a magnetic field strength of @xmath50 g , and an angular velocity of @xmath51s@xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1]_a _ shows the initial spherical cloud threaded by a uniform magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ fig:1]_b__d _ shows the cloud structure around the center of cloud when the central density reaches @xmath53 ( _ b _ ) @xmath54 , ( _ c _ ) @xmath55 , and ( _ d _ ) @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the density contours projected on the sidewall in these figures indicate that the central region becomes oblate as the cloud collapses because of the magnetic field and rotation , both of which are amplified as the cloud collapses .",
    "figure  [ fig:1]_a__d _ also shows that the magnetic field lines gradually converge toward the center as the central density increases .",
    "figure  [ fig:1]_g__i _ shows the evolution after the protostar formation , in which the strong jet is driven by the circumstellar disk .",
    "the speed of jet is @xmath57 that corresponds to the kepler speed near the protostar .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows a configuration of magnetic field lines ( black - white streamlines ) , a structure of a jet ( transparent iso - velocity surface ) and fragments for some models against @xmath27 - @xmath29 plane .",
    "the magnetically - dominated models ( @xmath47 ) show a powerful jet after the proto - population iii star formation without fragmentation ( or binary formation ) , while the rotation - dominated models ( @xmath58 ) show fragmentation and binary formation without jet driving . in the jet - driving models ,",
    "the magnetic field lines are strongly twisted inside the jet region .",
    "these jets have hourglass - like configurations of the magnetic field lines , where the poloidal component is more dominant than the toroidal component .",
    "these configurations of the magnetic field lines can easily drive a strong jet by the disk wind mechanism .    in fragmentation models ,",
    "the configurations of the magnetic field lines are disturbed , and the toroidal field tends to be more dominant than the poloidal filed .",
    "such configuration of the magnetic field lines means the weak magnetic field , which is insufficient to drive a jet .",
    "the weak poloidal field is attributed to the oblique shocks on the surface of the disk envelope , and the disturbance of the field lines are attributed to the orbital motion of the fragments and the spin of the fragments .",
    "the spin of the fragment winds the magnetic fields around its rotation axis , and the toroidal component of the magnetic field is amplified .",
    "thus , in the further stages , the magnetic pressure may drive a jet .",
    "in this study , we calculated cloud evolution from the stage of @xmath59 until the protostar is formed ( @xmath60 ) for 36 models , parameterizing the initial magnetic field strength and rotation , to investigate effects of magnetic fields in collapsing primordial clouds .",
    "our calculations showed that fragmentation occurs but no jet appears when @xmath58 , and jet appears after the protostar formation without fragmentation when @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in the collapsing primordial cloud , the cloud evolution is mainly controlled by the centrifugal force than the lorentz force when @xmath58 , while the lorenz force is more dominant than the centrifugal force when @xmath62 .",
    "a jet is driven when the initial cloud has magnetic field of @xmath63 if the cloud rotates slowly as @xmath64s@xmath52 .",
    "the power of a jet , e.g. , a mass ejection rate , is considered to be controlled by the accretion rate as indicated in present - day star formation ; the mass ejection rate of a jet is 1/10 of the mass accretion onto the protostar .",
    "the accretion rate of primordial star formation is expected to be considerably larger than that at present day , and it produces a stronger jet .",
    "the life time of the jet also seems to be controlled by accretion in the present - day ; a jet stops when mass accretion stops . for population iii stars ,",
    "the gas accretion does not halt within their lifetimes @xcite .",
    "therefore , a jet also may continue during the all lifetime of the protostar , and the strong jet propagates to disturb a surrounding medium significantly .",
    "the disturbance of the medium could trigger the subsequent star formation as frequently observed in present - day star formation .    assuming the power law growth of @xmath65 , the critical strength of the magnetic field , @xmath66 g at @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath68 g at @xmath69 [ see , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bcrit ] ) ] , which is much stronger than the background magnetic field derived by @xcite . however , when the magnetic field is amplified to @xmath70 g by some mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , the magnetic field can affect the collapse of the primordial cloud . even if a cloud has a magnetic field weaker than the critical strength @xmath66 g",
    ", the magnetic field may play an important role after the protostar formation . in analytical study of the evolution of accretion disks around the first stars @xcite ,",
    "it is suggested that magnetic fields amplified in the circumstellar disk eventually give rise to protostellar jets during the protostellar accretion phase .",
    "rotation promotes fragmentation when the first collapsed objects has the angular velocity of @xmath71s@xmath52 .",
    "the fragmentation is expected to produces binary or multiple stellar system .",
    "when a multiple stellar system is formed , some stars can be ejected by close encounters . at the protostar formation epoch , the protostar has a mass of @xmath72 .",
    "the ejected proto - population iii stars may evolve to metal - free brown dwarfs or low - mass stars .",
    "when a binary component in a multiple stellar system is ejected from the parent cloud by protostellar interaction , a low - mass metal free binary may also appear in the early universe .",
    "it is considered that the extremely metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath73 - 5 ) stars @xcite are formed as binary members from metal - free gas , and then have been polluted by the companion stars during the stellar evolution @xcite .",
