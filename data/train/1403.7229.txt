    "quantum dots ( qds ) are artificial systems that confine particles in all directions , yielding a discrete spectrum of energy levels . a variety of qds have been fabricated and studied , such as laterally confined qds in a two - dimensional electron gas , colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals , and semiconductor self - assembled qds to name only few . due to their semiconductor nature , self - assembled qds have electron energy levels grouped into valence ( with heavy- and light - hole subbands ) and conduction bands . in most cases , the upper - most energy levels in the valence band are of heavy - hole ( hh ) type . the energy difference between bands",
    "makes it possible to excite electrons from the valence to the conduction band by optical or near - optical fields . for this reason",
    ", applications to spintronics typically focus on the fast control of the spin state of carriers or nearby impurities by short - pulse excitation of qd states .",

    "the recent literature shows an increasing interest in light - hole ( lh ) state excitation and manipulation@xcite .",
    "a strong advantage of lhs over hhs is that , with their spin projections @xmath5 , spin - flips with e.  g.  an impurity spin can occur@xcite .",
    "however , the fast decay channel leading to the lower hh levels makes it difficult to use lhs in proposals designed for the former .",

    "conduction and valence bands are separated by a band - gap energy @xmath21 in the few ev range ; thus , interband transitions may be produced by optical or near - optical excitation .    in general , the upper - most energy levels in the valence band are of hh type ; however , an inversion between lh and hh bands is possible by applying stress to the sample@xcite .",
    "the inversion of energy levels is advantageous in proposals using lh excitations , since it slows the decay of the states .",
    "qds can be fabricated out of different materials .",
    "typical ones are inas / gaas or cdte / znte qds , but others may prove to be more suitable in certain situations .",

    "to be specific in what follows we use tl bessel beams@xcite , which are one class of optical - vortex fields .",

    "close to the phase singularity one can approximate @xmath43 . in the paraxial limit ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 is negligible , then @xmath1 is the topological charge and the beam carries a single value of orbital am .",

    "in what follows we will assume @xmath2 , but one can naturally choose @xmath48 , since the important distinction is that of the relative signs of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . furthermore the beam is assumed to be highly focused such that @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , and @xmath51nm@xmath52 is a measure of the beam waist .",
    "elsewhere@xcite we have shown that a convenient mathematical representation of tl close to the phase singularity ( located at @xmath24 ) is obtained by the so - called tl - gauge .",

    "magnetic terms appear that should not be a priori neglected .",
    "magnetic terms indeed overcome electric terms , for particular values of @xmath1 .",
    "however , for @xmath11 and the parameters chosen for the qd and beam all magnetic contributions are negligible ( see the appendix ) and we can indeed use the tl - gauge hamiltonian .",
    "the direct consequence is that we can restrict our analysis to just electric interactions for both polarizations .    for light with polarization @xmath8 [ using @xmath56 and eq .",

    "the change of variable leads to @xmath71 . since the electric field varies little within the unit cell we can disregard @xmath69 in the argument of the electric field .",

    "intra_-band transitions by @xmath73 .",
    "we study in this article interband transitions .    to conclude the section , we briefly comment on the similar behavior exhibited by other optical - vortex fields .",
    "the focusing of a paraxial optical vortex by a lens has been shown to produce a conversion between orbital and spin am@xcite , as it was commented after eq .",

    "for focused radially - polarized beams there is a non - vanishing @xmath16 component of the electric field at the phase singularity@xcite .",
    "besides , biss et al.@xcite have shown that radially / azimuthally polarized beams retain their spatial profile when focused through a dielectric interface , such as those of semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "this implies that the experimental control of the light - hole in a qd can be realize by focusing either bessel or laguerre - gaussian tl modes .",
    "also , focused radially - polarized beams can be used for the partial control of light - holes , as proposed with @xmath78 tl below .",

    "several groups have been successful in placing a single magnetic ion , such as mn or co , in a single qd of either ii - vi or iii - v material@xcite .",
    "the spin of such a magnetic impurity interacts with the electrons and holes in the qd ; this interaction is usually well described by heisenberg - type couplings between the various spins involved@xcite .",
    "this interaction gives rise to a characteristic splitting of the exciton line of the qd into a multiplet of lines , the details being strongly dependent on both the qd material and the impurity atom@xcite .",

    "it is necessary to selectively prepare the mn spin in any of its six possible orientations .",
    "various schemes have been proposed to achieve this task by coherent manipulation of excitons @xcite .",
    "these schemes are based on combined spin - flips of electron and mn spin or hole and mn spin . in the case of hh excitons ,",
    "only electron spin flips are possible because a heisenberg - type hamiltonian can not produce transitions from a state with @xmath112 to @xmath113 or vice versa .",
    "in contrast , in the case of lh excitons both types of spin flips are possible , which makes this type of excitons particularly attractive to achieve the mn spin preparation .",
    "the basic idea behind the mn spin switching schemes is the following : by optical excitation with a given polarization an exciton with a certain am is created .",
    "then , a correlated dynamics of the mn and the exciton spin system starts and at a suitable later time when the exciton is in a state with a different am , this exciton is removed again by a light pulse with the respective polarization . restricting oneself to circularly polarized plane - wave beams ,",
    "only mn spin flips by multiples of two are possible , because only excitons with am @xmath80 can be created or removed .",
    "however , adding linearly polarized light with polarization along the @xmath16-direction also lh excitons with am @xmath36 can be created or removed and thus the mn spin can be driven into all of its six eigenstates@xcite . using only plane - wave light , this scheme however requires the application of light pulses propagating in normal incidence direction and in an in - plane direction . from a practical point of view , such a double - beam set - up is cumbersome , because it requires light propagating in the qd plane and therefore typically cleaving of the sample is needed .",
    "we propose here the use of a single normal - incidence beam having either the values @xmath114 to address lh excitons with am @xmath80 , or @xmath115 to address excitons with am 0 . switching between one and the other value of light s orbital am",
    "can be achieved by the use of two co - linear beams ( a plane - wave one and the other of tl ) or by switching the topological charge of a single beam@xcite .",
    "in addition , twisted light offers a way to control the relative strength of the interaction between carriers and impurities .",
    "this interaction is typically well described by a contact interaction and its strength is therefore proportional to the modulus square of the wave - function of the involved carrier at the impurity position@xcite .",
    "electrons and holes are usually excited by plane - waves , producing electron - hole pairs where both carriers have the same orbital am , e.g. , @xmath83 in the @xmath13-shell or @xmath84 in the @xmath14-shell .",
    "thus , both carriers have their largest spatial probability either close to the qd center ( @xmath13-shell states ) or away from the center ( @xmath14-shell states ) .",
    "regardless of the impurity position  which varies from sample to sample due to fabrication uncontrollable parameters  the ratio between the electron - impurity and the hole - impurity interaction will be essentially the same in all samples .",
    "consider instead the excitation by tl with @xmath116 as depicted by dashed ( blue ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] . the electron and hole",
    "are created in the envelope @xmath14 ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath83 ) states , respectively .",
    "likewise , by tuning the light frequency to the appropriate transition , an electron - hole pair with electron in the envelope @xmath13 ( @xmath83 ) and hole in the envelope @xmath14 ( @xmath84 ) state can be created .",
    "thus , for an impurity placed at the center , in the former case the interaction with the hole will be strongly dominant while in the latter case the electron - impurity interaction will dominate .",
    "conversely , if the impurity is at some distance from the qd center , in the first case the electron and in the second case the hole will interact stronger .",
    "magnetic fields can be used to further tune the transition frequency and therefore select which carrier ( electron or hole ) is excited into an orbital state with @xmath117@xcite .",
    "one can even imagine the use of superposition of twisted light beams having different @xmath1 to further narrow the localization region of carriers .",
    "consider for example the simultaneous excitation with an @xmath118 and an @xmath119 beams .",
    "if the laser frequency is tuned to the transition between the valence - band state @xmath83 and the conduction - band state @xmath84 , the in - plane components of both fields will be responsible for the interaction .",
    "then , an electron in a superposition state of envelope @xmath120 and @xmath121 with spin up will be generated . by introducing a relative phase between the two beams , the spatial orientation of the electron s wave - function",
    "can be rotated , thus allowing to better control the interaction strengths with an impurity located away from the qd center .",
    "let us now consider the control of the spin of an excess electron in a charged qd by employing the @xmath16 component of the tl field .",
    "pazy et al.@xcite have suggested the use of a combination of two pulses traveling in orthogonal directions to achieve such a spin flip . as was previously mentioned",
    ", this idea faces implementation problems .",
    "for example , a realistic quantum computing proposal based on semiconductor technology would use a 2d array of a large number of charged qds @xcite , where each excess electron realizes a qubit , and the spin - flip implements a pauli - x gate .",
    "for this proposal , the use of light beams propagating in the plane of the array seems difficult or even impossible .",
    "however , as in other situations@xcite , the @xmath16-component of the optical vortex can prove very handy by producing the spin - flip at normal incidence .",
    "relying on recent experiments@xcite , we propose the use of optical - vortex pulses @xmath122 in the tens of femtoseconds range .",
    "note that the pulse duration is mainly limited by the spectral selectivity required for a specific sample . a sequence of normal - incidence @xmath123-pulses : @xmath124 ( first pulse left ) excites the charged qd at normal - incidence .        the relevant states are the single electron states @xmath125 and the charged exciton ( trion ) states @xmath126 , where the arrows @xmath127 refer to the electron spin and @xmath128 to the lh am .",
    "figure [ fig : states_01 ] shows a graphical representation of the states and possible transitions .",
    "such a pulse sequence can easily be seen to produce spin inversion of the excess electron .",
    "for ultra - short excitation , the whole evolution of the system can be broken into intervals of free evolution and pulse excitation@xcite .",
    "we will denote by @xmath129 the evolution operator for a certain time interval in which an optical - vortex pulse @xmath122 with pulse area @xmath123 is present .",
    "let us assume that the initial state of the system is @xmath130 . applying to it the aforementioned sequence of pulses , we get the final state @xmath131 disregarding the global phase arising from free evolution . on the other hand , starting with the initial state @xmath132",
    ", we get @xmath133 thus , in both cases we obtain an inversion of the electron spin .",
    "we note that , if the initial state is known , two pulses are sufficient , as in the first case the third pulse has no action on the state and in the second case this holds for the second pulse .",
    "the three - pulse sequence , however , works in both cases and it also works for an arbitrary superposition of the two electron spin states , as we see by a numerically simulation of the density matrix @xmath134 using the master - equation formalism within the 4-level system . figure [ fig : evolution_v1 ] shows the evolution starting from a pure superposition state @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "a full spin - inversion , equivalent to a pauli - x gate , is completed in less than a picosecond using moderate laser powers ( @xmath137v / m ) .     and",
    "the sequence of ultrashort @xmath123-pulses @xmath139 is applied at times @xmath140 ps respectively ; each gaussian pulse lasts for @xmath141ps .",
    "]    it is worth noting that there was no need to include decay and dephasing processes .",
    "while the excitation and de - excitation of eh pairs takes place in our protocol in less than a ps , the eh recombination and dephasing times are in the hundreds of ps @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spin dephasing time of conduction - band electron is in the nano- to microsecond range @xcite .",
    "however , some other factors are detrimental to the fidelity of the operation , for instance the detuning of the laser and deviations of the pulse area from the correct value @xmath123 . this sensitivity to pulse parameters",
    "might be overcome by employing the technique of adiabatic rapid passage using chirped pulses@xcite .    due to the short operation time",
    ", one could even relax the requirement of energy inversion between light and heavy hole bands , and so the present proposal would be compatible with qds where the hh is the lowest hole state .",
    "finally , thanks to the fact that the @xmath16-component of the field is constant near @xmath24 [ the correction is of order @xmath142 , there is no need to precisely center the beam axis on the qd .",
    "we have theoretically studied the excitation of light - holes in small quantum dots by highly - focused optical - vortex beams .",
    "to this end we employed the twisted - light gauge which casts the interaction hamiltonian in terms of electric fields , and can account for the simultaneous action of all three spatial components that typically appear in tightly - focused beams .",
    "we showed that a single optical - vortex beam at normal incidence can create all possible microscopic states of electron - hole pairs in the quantum dot , and we gave explicit expressions for the corresponding transition matrix elements .",
    "we applied our results to present proposals in spintronics , namely the manipulation of the spin of a magnetic impurity or of an excess electron in quantum dots , and demonstrated that those proposals can be improved by using optical - vortex fields .",
    "we also suggested a new possible way to address states of magnetic impurities , based on the transfer of orbital angular momentum to the envelope function of carriers in the quantum dot .",
    "g.  f.  quinteiro thanks the argentine research agency conicet for financial support through the `` programa de becas externas '' .",
    "in ref .   we have shown that a gauge transformation of the type @xmath143 leads to a convenient representation of the interaction hamiltonian . for light having sign(@xmath0)@xmath3sign(@xmath1 ) , the hamiltonian is given solely in terms of electric fields , while for sign(@xmath0)@xmath4sign(@xmath1 ) , one should in principle consider possible magnetic contributions , that are written in terms of the vector potential .",
    "we will next show that , for @xmath11 with the chosen parameters for qd and beam , the magnetic terms are in fact negligible .",
    "the gauge transformation applied to eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_bessel ] ) , produces a new scalar potential @xmath144 and a new vector potential @xmath145 with @xmath146 . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ell1 ] we have seen that the dominant component of the electric field is @xmath89 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : am0_efield_z ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , we are interested in comparing the magnetic interactions corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_tlgauge ] ) with the @xmath16-component part of the electric interaction .    as an example",
    ", we provide details on the relative strength of magnetic and electric interactions arising from the @xmath16 components .",
    "we calculate the ratio of interband matrix element @xmath147 to @xmath148 . in the former @xmath149 acts on the envelope part of the wave - function , while @xmath150 acts on the bloch - periodic part ; thus , one can split the matrix element into @xmath151 .",
    "furthermore , one can apply the well - known relationship @xmath152 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath89 can be pulled out of its matrix element , since it does not depend on coordinates .",
    "we note that the magnetic and electic terms may connect different initial and final states , and they should all be compared .",
    "let us next consider each term from @xmath149 separately : @xmath153 the operator @xmath16 forces initial and final states to be of opposite parity . since the qd is quasi 2d , the next @xmath16-subband has a much larger energy , and thus is well detuned from the transitions considered in the present paper .",
    "moreover , the matrix element is proportional to @xmath154 .",
    "thus , it is safe to neglect the first term of @xmath149 . next , we look at the second term @xmath155 since the @xmath156 are not eigenstate of the operator @xmath75 , we can only argue that the ratio is proportional to @xmath157 , and thus is also negligible . in conclusion",
    ", we see that the magentic field interaction is much smaller than the electric interaction considered in the article .",
