    "understanding the properties of ferromagnetic thin films is still one of the open questions in the physics of magnetic systems .",
    "an important issue is linking the domains and domain walls structure of a material with its hysteretic properties , like the barkhausen noise ( bn ) .",
    "the barkhausen effect @xcite consists in the irregularity of the magnetization variation while magnetizing a sample with a slowly varying external magnetic field , and is due to the jerky motion of the domain walls in a system with structural disorder and impurities .",
    "once the origin of bn was understood @xcite , it was soon realized that it could be used as an effective probe to investigate the magnetization dynamics in magnetic materials .",
    "furthermore , from a purely theoretical point of view , it is a good example of dynamical critical behavior , as evidenced by experimental observation of power law distributions for the statistics of the avalanche size and duration @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a growing evidence that soft magnetic bulk materials can be grouped in different classes according to the scaling exponents values @xcite , so that bn could be seen as a non destructive experimental tool for the analysis of the properties of a material , and a similar feature could be expected to hold for two - dimensional materials .    until now ,",
    "most of the models and experiments on bn have focused on three dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "the difficulties for the study of two dimensional samples , in fact , concern both the theoretical and the experimental aspects of the problem . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the topology of domain and domain walls is much more rich and complicated in two dimension ( parallel or head - on domains , charged and uncharged walls , magnetization in or out the film plane , parallel or _",
    "zigzag _ walls , labyrinthic domains , etc . )",
    "than in the bulk case @xcite ( mainly parallel domains with uncharged walls ) , so it is not obvious how to generalize the well known three dimensional models .",
    "the models currently used for three dimensional materials could be classified in two main groups , namely spin models of the ising type @xcite , and single domain wall models @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the inductive experimental setup commonly used for bulk samples @xcite is usually not suitable for thin films , due to the low intensity of the magnetic flux variation signal , which is roughly proportional to the sample thickness , and thus tends to vanish for very thin films .",
    "conversely , the magneto - optical @xcite and magneto - optical microscope magnetometry @xcite experiments , though able to supply the domain structure , that is not accessible by the inductive measurements , provide only partial informations about the probed zone , and not about the whole sample .",
    "so , despite the increasing interest concerning ferromagnetic thin films applications in magnetic recording technology and spintronic devices , a complete understanding of two dimensional system behavior is still lacking .",
    "in this article we focus on two dimensional systems with _ zigzag _ domain walls , which arise in thin films with head - on magnetization between nearest - neighbor domains , mainly due to the balance between the magnetostatic and the anisotropy contributions to the system total energy @xcite .",
    "those kind of walls have been observed for the first time in thin film magnetic recording media , where head - on domains are induced by means of the application of a recording head field , and have been then observed in films of several magnetic media such as iron @xcite , co @xcite , gd - co @xcite , epitaxial fe films grown on gaas(001 ) @xcite , ferrite - garnet films with strong cubic anisotropy @xcite and many others .",
    "this kind of walls have been observed too in ferroelectric materials , such as gd@xmath0(moo@xmath1)@xmath2 crystals @xcite .",
    "we present a study of the barkhausen noise at @xmath3 .",
    "we use a slightly modified version of a simple single - wall discrete model for the motion of the _ zigzag _ wall that we recently proposed for the study of the dynamic hysteresis in ferromagnetic thin films @xcite .",
    "our model is based on the interplay between dipolar and anisotropy energy contributions , in the presence of structural disorder and external magnetic field . via cellular automaton simulations",
    "the model describes the motion , in a disordered ferromagnetic thin film , of a _ zigzag _ wall between two domains of opposite magnetizations meeting head - on at the wall , up to the saturation of the magnetization driven by the external magnetic field .",
    "we find that the probability distributions of the size , the duration and the correlation length of the barkhausen avalanches show a power law behavior with a cutoff , and the critical exponents are in quantitative agreement with experimental data two dimensional sample , as co polycristalline thin films @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to have a deeper insight on the link between the size and the duration of the avalanches , we study the behavior of the average size of an avalanches as a function of its time duration , and find that it could be described too by a power law .",
    "our purpose is to study the motion of a single domain wall driven by an external magnetic field , by discrete model simulations . to this end , we start from a model that we have recently introduced @xcite : as we are interested in the macroscopic response , the aim of our model is to discretize the _ zigzag _ wall in minimum segments in order to map the quasi - two dimensional problem of the wall motion in a one dimensional model ( fig .",
    "[ zigzag ] ) , regardless the details of the wall internal structure that are not expected to influence the macroscopic length scale .",
    "we calculate the total energy of an arbitrary _ zigzag _ wall configuration , considering only the magnetostatic , the anisotropy and the disorder contributions , and the interaction with the external magnetic field : @xmath4 in the equation ( [ e ] ) , the magnetostatic term @xmath5 takes into account the interaction between the magnetization and the stray field , the anisotropy @xmath6 is the energy cost of the deviations from the easy axis of the material , that are associated with the nel tail surrounding the wall @xcite , and @xmath7 models structural disorder , impurities , defects etc ..    as we have discussed in our previous paper @xcite , the magnetostatic interaction energy between two segments @xmath8 and @xmath9 could be approximated as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath12 is the sample thickness , @xmath13 is the minimal half - period of a _ zigzag _ configuration , @xmath14 is the vacuum permeability and @xmath15 is the distance between the centers of mass of the two segments @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see fig . [ sample ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy energy term in the simple case of an uniaxial crystal can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the in - plane uniaxial anisotropy constant and @xmath18 is the angle between the easy axis and the magnetization vector .",
    "assuming @xcite that the magnetic charge associated with the magnetization rotation is uniformly distributed over the entire band containing the wall and a linear in - plane rotation of the magnetization vector , we obtain the anisotropy energy for unit length @xmath19 where @xmath17 is the anisotropy constant of the material , @xmath20 is the _ zigzag _ amplitude and @xmath21 is a constant function of the _ zigzag _ angle @xmath22 which could be evaluated numerically ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "concerning the @xmath7 term , we consider only quenched ( frozen ) disorder , that does not evolve on the timescale of the magnetization reversal .",
    "we model the disorder by an energy contribution associated to each site of our discretized sample which may be occupied by a segment ( our discrete unit length ) of the _ zigzag _ wall .",
    "this term is extracted from an uncorrelated random gaussian distribution with zero mean .",
    "the interaction energy with the external magnetic field @xmath23 , that is set on the easy axis direction , is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnetization of the system .",
    "the dynamics of the model is implemented by switching on the external magnetic field @xmath23 , looking for all the pairs of segments with slope up - down in the wall , i.e. the void - particle pairs , and trying to exchange the positions in the pair .",
    "this rule allows only the forward motion of pairs of segments with up - down slope , and preserves the _ zigzag _",
    "( solid - on - solid ) structure of the wall .",
    "once a possible displacement has been attempted , we calculate the total energy difference @xmath26 between the starting configuration and the new one by using eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) . the move is accepted if @xmath27 , and in that case we update the configuration and continue the process , otherwise we reject it .",
    "the acceptance of the move corresponds to the starting of an avalanche , that goes on until the wall comes to rest , i.e. when the minimum difference of energy @xmath28 over all the void - particle pairs is bigger than zero . to restart the process and eventually trigger another avalanche , we increase the external field by an amount @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the variation of the magnetization due to the flip of the void - particle pair , and continue the updating . for this",
    "parallel dynamics , we can identify the number of the iterations of the updating with the physical time .",
    "we begin the simulation from the @xmath31 at @xmath32 state and drive the sample to the positive saturation ( our sample has a finite size ) .",
    "from experimental magneto - optical observations ( fig . [ diff_sper ] ) we can infer that the dynamics of the wall is jerky and proceeds by avalanches , preserving the value of the _ zigzag _ angle and with a gradual increase of the _ zigzag _ period and amplitude .",
    "these features are recovered in our simulations ( see fig . [ diff_model ] ) : the wall may be pinned by the disorder and the depinning of a void - particle pair driven by the external magnetic field could eventually trigger an avalanche . moreover , when the field increases , the anisotropy and disorder energy terms become less important compared with @xmath33 .",
    "so the relevance of the magnetostatic interactions increases , and since this term tends to move the magnetostatic charges ( all of the same sign at the wall ) away from each other , it drives a coarsening of the _ zigzag _ segments , whose period thus increases .",
    "an avalanche is defined as the event between two pinned configuration of the domain wall . since in our model",
    "we only allow the forward motion of the wall , we can thus identify univocally the time duration and spatial size of an avalanche : the time duration is the number of updates from the depinning of the wall to the new pinned configuration , and the size is defined as the area interested by the magnetization reversal during an avalanche .",
    "it is thus possible to analyze the statistics of the avalanches , by constructing the probability distributions of the size @xmath34 , the duration @xmath35 and the correlation length @xmath36 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the probability distribution of the correlation lengths follows too a power law behavior , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the cutoff ( fig .",
    "[ lunghezza_correlazione ] ) , with an exponent close to @xmath39 .",
    "the low @xmath36 zone of fig .",
    "[ lunghezza_correlazione ] is very noisy because of the topology of the model : small avalanches with a correlation length of an even number of minimal segment are more probable than avalanches with odd @xmath36 , because for the correlation length study we consider the sum of the events in one uploading step , even if they are not geometrically connected .",
    "so is more likely to have , for instance , two elementary events in two separate parts of the sample than two connected events , for small avalanches size .",
    "moreover , for very high values of @xmath36 , we notice another deviation from the power law behavior , this time due to the finite size of the sample .",
    "in fact the avalanches that span the whole sample could not have a correlation length bigger than the sample size , so the probability distributions show peaks for values of @xmath36 around the system size , which are just an artifact of finite simulations , as of course the cutoff at the system length value .",
    "the cutoff distribution scales as @xmath40 . in fig .",
    "[ lunghezza_correlazione]@xmath41 we show that rescaling the correlation length as @xmath42 , the rescaled probability distributions @xmath43 obtained for the various system sizes collapse on the same curve .",
    "another interesting issue that could be studied is the correlation between the size and the duration of the avalanches .",
    "since avalanches with the same duration could show quite different sizes , this feature could be quantified by addressing to the link between the mean size @xmath44 of an avalanche and its duration @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ smedio_vs_t ] ) .",
    "this function follows a power law behavior @xmath45 with an exponent close to @xmath46 for all the three sample sizes that we have investigated ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "we can check the consistency of the exponent @xmath50 considering that it must be @xmath51 . using the power law @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath45",
    ", it can be easily derived that it must be    @xmath54    using @xmath55 and @xmath56 we would obtain @xmath57 that is in reasonable agreement with the measured value @xmath58 .",
    "the barkhausen noise is known to be due to the jerky motion of the domain walls in a disordered material during the magnetization process .",
    "even if the essential physics of the problem is well understood , many questions are still open .",
    "one of the most challenging related topics is the physics of ferromagnetic thin films , which displays new features with respect to bulk materials , and still remains to be fully explored both experimentally and theoretically . in this work",
    "we have applied a slightly modified version of a model that we have recently proposed @xcite for the study of dynamic hysteresis for systems with _ zigzag _ domain walls .",
    "this model takes into account the contribution to the total energy of the dipolar long range interactions , the anisotropy and the disorder .",
    "the dynamics of the model describes qualitatively the experimentally observed features of the domain wall motion , like the jerky nature of the motion and the coarsening of the _ zigzag _ amplitude .",
    "we have studied the size , the duration and the correlation length of the avalanches by means of their probability distributions , via cellular automaton simulations .",
    "all these distributions show a power law behavior and a cutoff due to finite size effects .",
    "the critical exponents of the three distributions are derived and we find a good agreement for the value of @xmath59 , associated with the size statistics , with recent magneto - optical measurements on co polycristalline thin films @xcite . anyway , more experimental confirmations are needed , especially for the duration and the correlation length distributions , for which no experimental data are available up to now .",
    "finally , we have investigated the link between the size and the duration of the barkhausen avalanches , by studying the average size of an avalanche as a function of its duration @xmath35 .",
    "even this function follows a power law , with a critical exponent close to @xmath60 .",
