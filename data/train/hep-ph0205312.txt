    "one of the prime objectives of a future @xmath7 linear collider ( lc ) will be the detailed study of spin - zero particles which remain in the physical spectrum after the elementary - particle masses have been generated through the higgs mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "should the world be supersymmetric , then the higgs sector is more complicated than in the standard model ( sm ) , which predicts just one neutral cp - even higgs boson @xmath8 .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) consists of a two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) and accommodates five physical higgs bosons : the neutral cp - even @xmath9 and @xmath10 bosons , the neutral cp - odd @xmath11 boson , and the charged @xmath12-boson pair .",

    ", the mssm higgs sector has just two free parameters , which are usually taken to be the @xmath15 and @xmath6 .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath12 bosons would prove the sm wrong and , at the same time , give strong support to the 2hdm and the mssm .",
    "if the @xmath12 bosons have mass @xmath19 , they will be mainly produced through the @xmath3 decays of top quarks , which are copiously generated singly or in pairs at an @xmath7 lc @xcite . on the other hand , if there is sufficient center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy available , @xmath20 , then charged - higgs - boson pair production , @xmath4 , will be the dominant production mechanism @xcite . otherwise , if @xmath21 , the @xmath12 bosons can still be produced singly .",
    "there are various mechanisms of single - charged - higgs - boson production @xcite .",
    "the most important of them are @xmath22 , which proceeds through quantum loops involving sm @xcite and possibly supersymmetric @xcite particles , @xmath23 @xcite , and @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "in such a situation , none of the virtual particles appearing in fig .  [",

    "we note in passing that the absence of resonances is also guaranteed if @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the dominant quantum corrections to the cross section of @xmath0 , which arise from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams emerge by attaching one gluon line in all possible ways to each of the diagrams shown in fig .",

    "this leads to @xmath33 diagrams with one closed loop ( see fig .  [",

    "the present paper fills this gap .",

    "= 14.cm    as a typical example , we consider in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] the case of @xmath26  gev , @xmath188 , and @xmath189  gev .",

    ", the @xmath121 dependence enters at lo via @xmath184 and at nlo via @xmath177 and @xmath184 .",
    "obviously , the theoretical uncertainties due to scheme and typical scale variations are significantly reduced as we pass from lo to nlo . on the one hand , the os - scheme to mixed - scheme ratio",

    "the @xmath121 dependence within the mixed scheme is reduced by a factor of 5 , from 0.020  fb to 0.004  fb in absolute terms .",
    "furthermore , we observe that , in the os scheme , the qcd corrections lead to a dramatic reduction of the cross section , by 3667% .",
    "as explained above , this is because they contain large logarithmic terms of the form @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is a generic mass scale in the ball park of some suitable average of the final - state - particle masses , @xmath183 , @xmath172 , and @xmath192 .",
    "in the mixed scheme with @xmath121 of order @xmath191 , such terms are shifted from the qcd corrections to the born result , where they are absorbed into the running of @xmath184 from @xmath193 to @xmath194 .",

    "let us now turn to the question of how to fix the value of @xmath121 in a reasonable way .",
    "scale - setting procedures frequently discussed in the literature include the concept of fastest apparent convergence ( fac ) @xcite , the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , and the proposal by brodsky , lepage , and mackenzie ( blm ) @xcite to resum the leading light - quark contribution to the renormalization of the strong - coupling constant .",
    "the latter is not yet applicable to the problem under consideration , which is of lo in the strong - coupling constant .",
    "the fac and pms prescriptions lead us to select the values of @xmath121 where the born and qcd - corrected results intersect and where the latter exhibits a local extremum , respectively .",

    "this may be understood by observing that the average strength of the @xmath5 coupling , which is proportional to @xmath201 , is then minimal @xcite .",

    "in fact , owing to our judicious scale choice , the born and qcd - corrected results in the mixed scheme and the qcd - corrected result in the os scheme all approximately coincide , which nicely demonstrates the perturbative stability in the mixed scheme and the feeble scheme dependence at nlo . by contrast , the perturbative stability in the os scheme is rather poor at large values of @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the relative importance of the contributions due to photon and @xmath40-boson exchanges .",
    "to this end , we evaluate the photon - induced part of the total cross section by putting @xmath203 and compare it with the full result .",
    "we find that the bulk of the total cross section is due to photon exchange .",

    "we considered the process @xmath0 and its charge - conjugate counterpart in the mssm , which are among the dominant charged - higgs - boson production mechanisms at a future @xmath7 lc if @xmath25 , so that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are not allowed kinematically . for @xmath26  gev and 800  gev",
    ", this corresponds to the @xmath192 windows @xmath27  gev and @xmath28  gev , respectively .",
    "we presented a compact born formula for the cross sections of these processes and evaluated their dominant radiative corrections , which arise from qcd .",
    "we regularized the ir singularities by introducing an infinitesimal gluon mass @xmath119 and the uv ones by using dimensional regularization .",
    "the ir singularities cancelled when the virtual and soft real qcd corrections were combined and the uv ones upon renormalizing the masses and wave functions of the quarks in the born transition - matrix element .",
    "we established these cancellations analytically .",
    "we separated the soft - gluon and hard - gluon contributions by introducing an unphysical gluon - energy cutoff @xmath138 and verified that their sum is insensitive to the choice of @xmath138 as long as @xmath139 is satisfied .",
    "we worked in a mixed renormalization scheme , where the strong - coupling constant and the @xmath50-quark mass are defined in the @xmath131 scheme , while the @xmath44-quark mass is defined in the os scheme . in this way , large logarithmic corrections that arise if the @xmath5 yukawa coupling is expressed in terms of the @xmath50-quark pole mass are automatically resummed , so that the convergence behaviour of the perturbative expansion is improved . on the other hand",
    ", the use of the @xmath44-quark @xmath131 mass does not entail such an improvement , but it rather appears somewhat unnatural from the physical point of view .",
    "the inclusion of the qcd corrections significantly reduces the theoretical uncertainties due to scheme and typical scale variations .",
    "we found that the qcd corrections to the total cross section may be of either sign , depending on the values of @xmath202 , @xmath6 , and @xmath192 , and that they may reach a magnitude of up to 50% .",
    "the @xmath7 lc tesla , which is being developed at desy , has a design luminosity of @xmath205  cm@xmath166s@xmath207 ( @xmath208  cm@xmath166s@xmath207 ) at @xmath26  gev ( 800  gev ) , which corresponds to 340  fb@xmath207 ( 580  fb@xmath207 ) per year @xcite .",
