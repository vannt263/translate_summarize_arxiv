    "the ternary rare - earth diborocarbides reb@xmath1c@xmath1 ( re : rare - earths ) with heavy re elements attract special attentions recently , as they exhibit intriguing successive ordering at low temperatures .",
    "exemplified by dyb@xmath1c@xmath1 , the specific heat measurement detects two anomalies at @xmath9  k and @xmath10  k.  @xcite the higher temperature anomaly at @xmath11 is attributed to ordering of quadrupole moments by various measurements such as the ultrasonic vibration measurement  @xcite and resonant x - ray diffraction .  @xcite it has been suggested that the quadrupolar moments originate from nearly degenerated two kramers doublets realized by pseudo - cubic local symmetry around the dy@xmath12 ions . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower temperature anomaly at @xmath13 is due to magnetic ( dipole ) ordering .",
    "the magnetic structure established below @xmath13 is non - trivial ; a complicated multi-@xmath14 ferrimagnetic structure is realized with the four modulation vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "such a structure can not be stabilized by usual exchange - type interactions ( including rkky - type interactions ) , and strong influence by the quadrupolar order has been inferred .",
    "@xcite as exemplified above , interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar degrees of freedom is essential for the complex successive ordering in the reb@xmath1c@xmath1 compounds with heavy re elements .",
    "in contrast , reb@xmath1c@xmath1 with the light rare - earth element re = ce does not have quadrupolar degree of freedom ; absence of the ground state degeneracy has been reported in the ultrasonic vibration measurement .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 is of particular interest because influence of magnetic interactions to the complex successive ordering may be separately deduced from that of the quadrupolar interactions by comparing ordering behavior of non - quadrupolar ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 with those in the heavy re systems .",
    "also , strong electron correlations originating from larger hybridization between @xmath5 and conduction electrons may bring about intriguing low - temperature properties .",
    "earlier studies on ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 may be summarized as follows .",
    "electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath17 was estimated in the paramagnetic temperature range as @xmath18  mj / mol k@xmath19 .",
    "@xcite thus , ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 may be classified as a heavy - fermion system with moderate mass enhancement , a typical consequence of strong electron correlations in the @xmath5 electron systems .",
    "a sharp anomaly at @xmath2  k was observed in the specific heat and magnetization measurements ,  @xcite indicating that a certain magnetic order is established below this temperature .",
    "the specific heat anomaly is followed by a broad shoulder around @xmath20  k , of which the origin is not elucidated . to date",
    ", only one attempt was made to solve the magnetic structure ; neutron diffraction experiment was performed using a single - crystal sample , and succeeded in observing a magnetic bragg reflection at @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite on the basis of this observation , an incommensurately modulated structure was inferred in the ordered phase .",
    "however , because of insufficient quality of the crystal , it was the single peak that the diffraction experiment could detect , and consequently , the magnetic structure of the ordered phase could not be determined .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering has also been carried out to determine the crystalline - electric - field ( cef ) splitting of the ce@xmath12 4f levels ;  @xcite the inelastic spectrum was measured at 7  k for @xmath24  mev .",
    "however , because of the limited energy range and temperature point , it hardly provides details of the spin fluctuations and excitations in ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 .",
    "knowledge on the low - temperature magnetic structure is essential for the understanding of the magnetic ordering in the ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 , and its relation to reb@xmath1c@xmath1 with heavy re elements .",
    "the cef splitting and spin fluctuation spectrum are also crucial information to elucidate its magnetic properties .",
    "hence , to address these issues we have undertaken low - temperature neutron powder diffraction and inelastic scattering experiments in the present work . in the powder diffraction",
    "we have succeeded in obtaining intensity data for a number of magnetic bragg reflections , whereas inelastic spectra in a wide energy range up to 80  mev were collected at several temperatures below 100  k. these experiments enable us to unambiguously determine the magnetic structure in the ordered phase , as well as peak energies in the inelastic spectrum ; it will be shown that the lowest - temperature magnetic structure is a sinusoidally modulated structure with the modulation vector @xmath3 $ ] , whereas the inelastic scattering detects broad quasielastic and two inelastic ( cef ) peaks around @xmath4 and 65  mev in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the quasielastic fluctuations are suppressed below @xmath6 , and a sharp inelastic peak emerges in the low energy region .",
    "polycrystalline samples of ce@xmath0b@xmath1c@xmath1 ( about 10  grams in total ) were prepared using an arc furnace under an ar gas atmosphere .",
    "purity of the starting elements was 99.9  % for ce and c. to avoid strong neutron absorption of natural boron , we used the isotope enriched @xmath0b ( 99.53  % enrichment ) .",
    "structural quality of the resulting polycrystalline samples was checked by the x - ray powder diffraction as well as the neutron diffraction .",
    "the polycrystalline samples were crushed into powder and loaded in a thin al sample cell for the neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the cell was then set to a @xmath25he closed - cycle refrigerator .",
    "neutron powder diffraction was performed using a powder - diffraction detector bank newly installed to the lam-80et inverted - geometry time - of - flight ( tof ) spectrometer at the kens spallation neutron source , kek , japan .",

    "@xcite final energy was fixed to 4.59  mev using the pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) 002 reflections , whereas higher harmonic neutrons were eliminated by cooled be filters .",
    "there are four analyzers at the scattering angles @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; we mainly show data taken with the lower angle detectors in this report , and higher angle data are used only for phonon subtraction purpose .",
    "energy resolution was estimated as @xmath49  mev [ full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ] at the elastic position using a vanadium standard .",
    "background was subtracted from the raw data using a proper combination of empty - cell and absorber runs , and absorption effect was corrected using numerically calculated absorption factors .",
    "first of all , the validity of the newly installed detector bank and the home - made rietveld analysis code is confirmed by solving the room temperature structure of ce@xmath0b@xmath1c@xmath1 .",

    "next , to investigate the spin fluctuations and excitations , we have performed the inelastic scattering experiment using the same powder sample . to reliably obtain magnetic scattering intensity from the raw inelastic spectrum ,",
    "a phonon contribution has to be carefully removed .",
    "hence , we first make an estimation of the phonon contribution using high temperature data at @xmath67  k. for the rare - earth compounds in a paramagnetic temperature range , magnetic scattering may originate from local ( single - site ) transitions , and thus , @xmath68-dependence of the magnetic scattering may be dominantly given by the magnetic form factor .",
    "on the other hand , the phonon scattering may approximately exhibit @xmath69 dependence .",

    "figure  4 exemplifies this phonon subtraction procedure for the representative data at @xmath78  k. the solid line stands for the estimated phonon intensity , whereas phonon - subtracted magnetic intensity is shown by the filled circles . in the low energy region ,",
    "the phonon intensity is considerably small , whereas the phonon intensity becomes dominant in the higher energy region ( @xmath79  mev ) .",
    "this large phonon contamination reduces statistical accuracy of the estimated magnetic intensity , however , one finds that there definitely exists finite magnetic intensity for @xmath80  mev .",
    "the phonon - subtracted magnetic scattering spectra at four representative temperatures @xmath82 , and 15.5  k in the paramagnetic phase are shown in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "three peaks are recognized in the spectra at all the temperatures , in addition to the sharp @xmath83-function like elastic peak : ( i ) quasielastic component centered at @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "6 ) ; ( ii ) inelastic peak at @xmath85  mev ( fig .",
    "5 ) ; ( iii ) weak inelastic peak at @xmath86  mev ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "since those spectra were measured in the paramagnetic phase , the peaks are most likely due to transitions between the cef splitting levels .",
    "hence , the observed spectra are analyzed using the following cef hamiltonian derived for ce@xmath12 in the @xmath87 site symmetry of the @xmath56 site in ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 : @xmath88 where @xmath89 stands for the stevens operators .",
    "@xcite under above cef , @xmath90 multiplet of ce@xmath12 splits into three kramers doublets .",

    "@xcite for the pseudo - voigt function , the width of the unconvoluted lorentzian is denoted by @xmath97 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we note that the lowest order coefficient @xmath98 can be determined precisely using a single crystal magnetization measurement ; @xmath98 is estimated as 6.34  k in the earlier work .",
    "@xcite thus , we fix @xmath98 , and try to find the optimum values for @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 that reproduce all the inelastic spectra in the paramagnetic phase simultaneously . in the fitting , we assume that temperature dependence of the hamiltonian parameters @xmath102 , and @xmath101 is negligible in the present temperature range . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the width parameters @xmath103 are assumed as temperature dependent ; only @xmath104 and @xmath105 have to be fixed to the empirical value 12  mev because of the insufficient statistics in the high energy regions .",
    "the resulting optimum parameters for the cef hamiltonian are @xmath106  k , @xmath107  k and @xmath108  k. calculated spectra using these parameters are shown in fig .  5 by the solid lines .",
    "reasonable coincidence can be seen between the observed and calculated intensities at all the temperatures .",
    "the fact that the temperature dependence is well reproduced confirms the cef ( magnetic ) origin of the three peaks .",
    "it should be noted here that parameter @xmath101 could not be estimated reliably ; its uncertainty range is considerably larger than those of other parameters .",
    "this parameter exists in the cef hamiltonian because of the broken four fold symmetry due to the b - c ordering .",
    "since b and c have relatively similar electronegativity , the symmetry breaking may possibly be moderate , and thus we might infer that @xmath101 may be irrelevant .",
    "earlier neutron inelastic scattering experiment provides considerably different hamiltonian parameters ; @xmath109  mev ( @xmath110  k ) and @xmath111  mev ( @xmath112  k ) .",
    "@xcite the discrepancy is due to the assignment of the highest inelastic peak ; the previous study assigned the highest energy peak to a very broad hump found at @xmath113  mev in their spectrum .",
    "the hump is completely absent in the presently observed inelastic spectrum .",
    "it may be noteworthy that a weak peak in phonon density of states of the elemental aluminum , which is commonly used for sample cells in inelastic neutron scattering , exists in this energy range , and thus this may become a source of uncertainty . on the other hand , we clearly see the highest energy peak at @xmath86  mev , which is out of the observation energy range of the previous study",
    ". we also note that earlier macroscopic study provides rough estimate of the cef levels at 102  k and 1110  k ,  @xcite supporting our result .",
    "the energy separations of the kramers doublets are determined in the present study .",
    "see text for details . ]    among the three peaks , the quasielastic peak is of particular interest in the ce compounds , since it reflects the low - energy scattering process between the ground state doublets and the conduction electrons .",
    "hence , we parameterize the quasielastic - peak width as a function of temperature . to obtain the width precisely , the fitting is performed in the limited energy range @xmath114  mev using the pseudo - voigt function with the unconvoluted lorentzian width @xmath115 as fitting parameter .",
    "the fitting result is depicted by the solid lines in fig .",
    "obtained temperature variation of the quasielastic peak width @xmath115 is shown in fig .",
    "the quasielastic peak becomes narrower on cooling , as generally seen in heavy - fermion systems .",
    "it may be noteworthy that the quasielastic width is noticeably large even at @xmath116  k , just above @xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that quasielastic fluctuations due to the scattering by the conduction electrons are still dominant in vicinity of the ordering temperature .",

    "solid lines in this plot are guides to the eyes . , title=\"fig : \" ]    as seen in the previous section , the temperature dependence of inelastic spectrum is found to be moderate in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "however , it shows drastic change across @xmath6 .",
    "representative inelastic spectrum below @xmath6 is shown in fig .  9 , in comparison with the paramagnetic spectrum at @xmath120  k. the broad quasielastic signal around @xmath121 disappears below @xmath6 , and a new inelastic peak develops at @xmath122  mev , instead .",
    "note that the newly appearing 2.1  mev peak is quite sharper than that of the quasielastic peak at @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the low - energy spin fluctuations in the ground state doublet are strongly suppressed on ordering .",
    "this strongly suggests dissociation of @xmath5 electrons from the conduction electrons , _",
    "i.e. _ formation of the localized moment in the ordered phase .",
    "on the origin of the sharp inelastic peak , several possibility may be anticipated . the simplest possibility may be splitting of the ground state doublet by the internal ( exchange ) molecular field appearing in the ordered phase . to check this possibility , we calculated the single - site cef excitation spectrum under the internal field by introducing the zeeman term @xmath123 in the cef hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : cef ] ) .",
    "direction of the internal field @xmath124 is parallel to the spin direction [ 110 ] . the calculated inelastic spectrum assuming @xmath125  t is shown in fig .",
    "9(a ) by the dotted line .",
    "the peak position is reproduced by introducing the internal field , however , relative spectral weights of the peaks are apparently inconsistent with the observed spectrum . since in the sinusoidally modulated structure the molecular field is not uniform , another possibility may be the doublet splitting due to the distributed ( non - uniform ) internal fields .",
    "however , the distribution will apparently introduce peak broadening , and thus will not reproduce the sharpness of the 2.1  mev peak . as above , the single - site cef origin is unlikely for the sharp inelastic peak . as another possibility",
    ", we may thus speculate that the inelastic peak plausibly stems from a certain collective excitation of the interacting ising - like spins formed by the ground state doublets .",
    "to pursue the origin of the 2.1  mev inelastic peak , further study on its @xmath126-dependence using a single crystal is necessary .",
    "such a single - crystal inelastic scattering experiment is in progress .",
    "it should be reminded that the long - period sinusoidally modulated structure has a number of spins that have strongly reduced average spin magnitudes @xmath127 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in a localized spin system ,",
    "such reduced spins are realized by thermal fluctuations , and thus becomes unstable for further lowering temperature .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , for an incommensurate phase in heavy - fermion systems , such reduced spins are formed by quantum fluctuations ; coupling with conduction electrons enables a formation of spin - density - wave - type ( sdw ) order , as typically seen in ce@xmath8la@xmath7ru@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite or ce(ru@xmath7rh@xmath8)@xmath1si@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in both the cases , either thermal or quantum spin fluctuations should remain in the sinusoidally modulated phase . in contrast to the above understanding of the sinusoidally modulated phase , quasielastic fluctuations are completely suppressed in ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 .",
    "this is a very unique characteristic of the sinusoidally modulated phase in the ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 , and further experimental as well as theoretical study is highly desired to clarify this issue .    finally , we compare the ordered spin structure of ceb@xmath1c@xmath1 with those in the heavy re systems .",
    "incommensurately modulate structures have been frequently observed in the heavy re systems , such as hob@xmath1c@xmath1 ,  @xcite tbb@xmath1c@xmath1 ,  @xcite and erb@xmath1c@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in hob@xmath1c@xmath1 , incommensurately modulated spin structure is realized blow @xmath128  k with the two modulation vectors @xmath129 and @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "<S> the broadness of the quasielastic peak indicates strong spin fluctuations due to coupling between localized @xmath5 spins and conduction electrons in the paramagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent feature is suppression of the quasielastic fluctuations , and concomitant growth of a sharp inelastic peak in a low energy region below @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests dissociation of the conduction and localized @xmath5 electrons on ordering , and contrasts the presently observed incommensurate phase with spin - density - wave order frequently seen in heavy fermion compounds , such as ce(ru@xmath7la@xmath8)@xmath1si@xmath1 . </S>"
