    "the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) is comprised of radiation emitted throughout the entire history of the universe ( e.g. bond , carr & hogan 1986 ) .",
    "the cib contains emission from objects which may be too faint to be individually detected or too numerous to be individually resolved with current ( or even future ) instruments .",
    "however , since the collective emission is detectable , the cib provides unique information on the history of the universe at very early times .",
    "analogous to studying the brightness and structure of individual galaxies in which the stars can not be resolved , in recent years we have witnessed new cib measurements identifying and constraining both its mean level ( isotropic component ) and spatial fluctuations ( see kashlinsky 2005a for a recent review ) .",
    "the near - ir cib ( hereafter taken to span wavelengths from @xmath8 ) probes stellar emission , whereas at longer wavelengths the cib is generated by dust .",
    "foregrounds , such as galactic stars , interstellar dust emission ( cirrus ) , zodiacal light , and atmospheric emission , represent formidable obstacles to isolating the true cib ( see review by leinert et al 1998 ) .",
    "significant progress in cib research was made possible due to dedicated space experiments conducted by cobe / dirbe ( hauser et al .",
    "1998 ; see review by hauser & dwek 2001 ) and _ irts _ ( matsumoto et al . 2005 ) .",
    "theoretically , the most plausible candidates for the bulk of the near - ir cib are evolving stellar populations in galaxies .",
    "these nucleosynthetic energy sources would include the first generation of stars , known as population iii .",
    "a fraction of the cib must also be generated by accretion onto black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) rather than by stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is now thought that the first stars were very massive ( see review by larson & bromm 2004 ) , in which case theoretical models indicate they may produce a detectable contribution to the mean level of the near - ir cib ( santos et al .",
    "2002 , salvaterra & ferrarra 2003 ; kashlinsky 2005b , dwek , arendt & krennich 2005 , fernandez & komatsu 2005 ) .",
    "they are also expected to have left a measurable imprint in cib anisotropies ( cooray et al .",
    "2004 , kashlinsky et al .",
    "the intuitive reasons why these fluctuations would be significant are : 1 ) if massive , such stars would emit at light to mass ratios @xmath9 higher than the present - day stellar populations leading to significant cib flux levels ; 2 ) assuming that the pop iii era occupied a comparatively narrow epoch in time ( say @xmath10 a few hundred million years ) there should be a higher amplitude of relative cib fluctuations ( @xmath11 ) ; and 3 ) it is expected that within the framework of the concordance @xmath12cdm model the first stars formed out of rare high peaks of the underlying density field and , hence , their correlation properties would be amplified .",
    "the cib fluctuations from such early populations are distinguishable from those produced by more recent populations .",
    "their spatial spectrum should reflect the @xmath12cdm matter spectrum rising to a peak at @xmath13 and its spectral energy distribution should be cutoff due to the lyman break at wavelengths @xmath14 \\micron$ ] ( cooray et al .",
    "2004 , kashlinsky et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "present measurements of the mean cib levels are based on the dirbe and _ irts _ data and suggest a substantial excess over the contribution from known galaxy populations ( dwek & arendt 1998 , gorjian et al . 2001 ,",
    "arendt & dwek 2003 , matsumoto et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this excess of @xmath15 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 at @xmath16  ( kashlinsky 2005a ) is commonly known as the nirbe ( near - ir background excess ) . if produced by the first massive stars , it is proportional to the fraction of baryons processed through these stars ; a fraction of @xmath17 is necessary to explain the levels claimed in the above studies . on the other hand , much of this excess may be due to inaccurate zodiacal light modeling ( dwek et al . 2005 ) and the remaining nirbe may be much smaller , in agreement with the recent analysis of the deep _ hst _ nicmos data at 1.6 @xmath18 ( thompson et al .",
    "further limits on the cib come from the amount of photon absorption at @xmath6-ray energies in blazars at moderate @xmath19 ( dwek et al .",
    "2005 , aharonian et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however such limits are sensitive to the assumptions on the intrinsic unabsorbed blazar spectrum and the fine details of the cib spectral distribution ( kashlinsky & band 2007 ) ; they are discussed later in the paper .    at certain wavelengths",
    "cib fluctuations can be more readily measurable than the mean levels . as differential rather than absolute measurements , the study of fluctuations places different requirements on instrument capabilities and calibration , and on the precision of removal of foreground emission ( zodiacal and galactic ) .",
    "shectman ( 1974 ) applied fluctuations analysis to constrain the diffuse light in the optical bands .",
    "kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) have pioneered such studies in the ir using dirbe data with a further analysis by kashlinsky & odenwald ( 2000 ) isolating the degree - scale cib fluctuation at 1 - 5 @xmath18 .",
    "the _ irts _ results on cib fluctuations at @xmath20 agree with the latter study and extend to larger angular scales ( matsumoto et al . 2005 ) . because of their wide beams the dirbe- and _ irts_-based data sets did not allow the removal of many foreground galaxies and the isolation of the contribution from fainter sources . using ground - based deep 2mass measurements in the j , h",
    ", k photometric bands enabled removal of galaxies to @xmath21 and led to detecting the cib fluctuations signal from galaxy populations below that magnitude threshold on subarcminute scales ( kashlinsky et al .",
    "2002 , odenwald et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , all of these studies involved data sets with either low angular resolution and/or relatively shallow integrations so that the cib fluctuations from the remaining galaxies and instrument noise prevented isolating any signal arising from the first stars epochs .    in the past several years",
    "we have used deep - integration _ spitzer _",
    "data to measure the cib fluctuations component ( kashlinsky , arendt , mather & moseley 2005 , 2007a , b , c - hereafter kamm1 , kamm2 , kamm3 , kamm4 ) .",
    "they revealed significant cib fluctuations at the irac wavelengths ( 3.6 to 8 @xmath18 ) which remain after removing galaxies down to very faint levels ( kamm1 , kamm2 ) .",
    "these fluctuations must arise from populations that have a significant clustering component , but only low levels of shot noise ( kamm3 ) .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that there are no correlations between source - subtracted irac maps and the corresponding fields observed with the _ hst _ acs at optical wavelengths ( kamm4 ) , which means that the sources producing these cib fluctuations are _ not _ in the acs source catalog extending to @xmath22 at wavelengths @xmath23 .",
    "kamm found statistically significant cross - correlations between the different irac channels , indicating the presence of a common component in all the channels , and determined the color of unresolved fluctuations ( kamm1 ) .",
    "their analysis allowed the separation of various noise and systematic effects individually in each irac channel ( kamm1 , kamm2 ) , thus characterizing the statistical uncertainties and systematic errors in fluctuation measurements .",
    "the results were further verified with simulated patterns of first star galaxies ( kamm1 ) .",
    "the simulations recovered the input fluctuations and established the good accuracy of the determined diffuse backgrounds in the assembled images .",
    "these techniques directly showed that our existing procedure based on fourier transforms _ and _ correlation function analysis does not lead to biased estimates of the cib fluctuations ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe , illustrate , and further verify many details of our analysis efforts . in  2 , we describe the _ spitzer _ data sets we have analyzed and the self - calibration procedures we have applied in order to generate maps with accurate large scale structure .",
    "section 3 details the steps used in the analysis of the power spectra of the backgrounds .",
    "section 4 illustrates the extent to which the derived cib power spectra depend on the details of the analysis steps , particularly the masking and removal of resolved foreground sources .",
    "section 5 discusses the results , with future prospects described in section 6 .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary (  7 ) .",
    "in this section we present the steps taken to process the individual frames of irac data into integrated mosaicked images for each field , wavelength and epoch ( see also the supplementary information of kamm1 ) .",
    "this is the first stage of the overall data processing and analysis which is shown schematically in figure [ fig : flow ] .",
    "discussion of the effects that the data reduction may have on the results , and of the comparison of results between different fields and different epochs is deferred to  4 , after we present the analysis procedures in  3 .",
    "our research has used data from _",
    "spitzer s _ irac instrument .",
    "this camera contains two parallel optical systems .",
    "each system images a separate @xmath24 field of view , with the fields separated by @xmath25 . using beam splitters",
    ", each optical system collects images in two channels ( at two wavelengths ) simultaneously .",
    "so while one field of view is being observed at 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath18 , a nearly adjacent field is being observed at 4.5 and 8 @xmath18 .",
    "the detector for each channel is a @xmath26 pixel array , with a scale of @xmath27/pixel .",
    "this pixel scale slightly undersamples the instrument point spread function at the shortest wavelengths . the paper by fazio et al .",
    "( 2004a ) is the primary description of the irac instrument .",
    "many other details are contained within the _ spitzer _ observer s manual and the irac data handbook , which are found on the spitzer science center website .",
    "normal observing procedures entail dithering the telescope pointing between successive exposures or frames .",
    "altering the pointing by various fractions of the array size prevents any detector defects ( e.g. bad pixels ) from completely eliminating data from a particular point on the sky .",
    "dithering also serves to alter the pattern of stray light artifacts ( most prominently occurring near bright sources that lie just outside the field of view ) .",
    "most importantly , dithered data can be used to derive the relative detector offsets ( and gains ) as the sky itself can serve as a stable relative calibration source . mapping fields larger than the instantaneous @xmath24 field of view is usually done by stepping though a rectangular grid of @xmath28 positions separated by @xmath29 , with many dithered frames collected at each raster position . because of the offset between the two instrument fields of view , the overall coverage at 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath18 is displaced from that at 4.5 and 8 @xmath18 by @xmath25 . in some programs ,",
    "the field is re - observed after 6 months have elapsed . at that time",
    "the relative locations of the two fields of view are transposed , and thus if both epochs of data are combined then the same area can be covered equally in all four channels ( wavelengths ) .",
    "the properties of the irac data sets we have examined are listed in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "the irac ioc deep image observations were a test to verify that a deep ( close to confusion ",
    "limited ) integration could detect moderately high redshift sources .",
    "they were also intended to verify that the noise in an image would scale inversely with the square root of the integration time , even for very deep integrations .",
    "a secondary goal of these observations was to investigate the effects of different dither patterns and observing strategies on the results .",
    "analyses of the resolved sources in this field have been published by fazio et al .",
    "( 2004b ) and barmby et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the nominal target field for these observations was a field including the quasar hs 1700 + 6416 and several known lyman break galaxies .",
    "each channel observed a @xmath30 field , or @xmath31 irac fields of view .",
    "the field observed at 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath18 only overlaps with the field covered at 4.5 and 8 @xmath18 in a @xmath32 region .",
    "the dithering used during the observations extended the coverage over a wider region than the @xmath33 irac field of view , but this coverage is at a lower depth than the center of the field .",
    "scheduling constraints required that the observations be broken up into several astronomical observation requests ( aors ) , so each aor employed a different dithering or coverage strategy .",
    "the observations were carried out over an interval of less than 2 days .",
    "therefore any changes in the zodiacal light were small , e.g. the 8 @xmath18 zodiacal light intensity changes from 4.595 mjy sr@xmath4 to 4.600 mjy sr@xmath4 between the start of the first and last aors according to the spitzer science center s zodiacal light model .",
    "at the time we began this project ( kamm1 ) , the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) pipeline was not so well developed , and calibration observations had not been accumulated over a long enough time to provide the best flat field and dark frame calibration .",
    "therefore we performed our own data reduction beginning with the raw data .",
    "we applied the least ",
    "squares self  calibration procedure as described by fixsen , moseley & arendt ( 2000 ) .",
    "the approach formalizes the calibration procedure by describing the data with a model whose parameters include both the detector characteristics and the true sky intensity .",
    "the derivation of the model parameters via a least  squares algorithm yields an optimal solution for the calibration and the sky intensity . in this case",
    "our chosen model is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the raw data from a single pixel of a single frame , @xmath36 is the sky intensity at location @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the gain and offset for detector pixel @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is a variable offset for each of the 4 readouts ( alternate vertical columns of the detector ) and each frame .",
    "this model assumes that the sky intensity ( @xmath36 ) and the detector gains and offsets ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) are invariant during the course of the observations . for a data set with fixed frame times ( as our irac data ) , the detector dark current",
    "is included in the @xmath39 term as it is indistinguishable from an offset . for data sets with multiple frame times ,",
    "a relatively simple extension of this data model could be applied .",
    "the variable offset @xmath41 can absorb time ",
    "dependent behavior of the detector , but only to the extent that it can be characterized with a single value frame , or in some cases , a single value per readout per frame .    in order to be able to self",
    " calibrate the raw data for both gain and offset effects , the procedure requires a higher intensity contrast than is found in the qso 1700 data alone .",
    "therefore additional aors taken at low ecliptic latitude ( and hence high zodiacal brightness ) were combined with the ioc deep image aors for the self  calibration .",
    "ideally , these `` hizodi '' observations would have been performed just before or after the qso 1700 observations .",
    "however in fact , the nearest suitable 200sec frame time data for channels 1  3 ( 3.6  5.8 @xmath18 ) were observed over a month later , although suitable 100sec ( 2@xmath4250sec ) frame time data for channel 4 ( 8 @xmath18 ) were observed shortly prior to the qso 1700 aors .    the self ",
    "calibration was initially applied to each of the qso 1700 aors ( combined with the hizodi aor ) separately . however , as variations proved to be relatively small , our final results were obtained by running the self - calibration on the complete set of 200sec frame time data at each wavelength . in the case of the 8 @xmath18 data , which used four 50sec frames for each 200 sec frame in the other channels , we self - calibrated the data in 4 subsets , which were combined as a weighted average of the resulting mosaics .    after the derived gain and offset calibrations are applied to the individual frames and before they are mosaicked , each frame at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath18",
    "is corrected for the `` column pulldown '' effect in the columns of bright point sources ( see the irac data handbook ) using a version of the algorithm that is available from the ssc as a user  contributed tool . for 8 @xmath18 frames we applied a similar correction of our own development to correct for the `` banding '' artifact which affects detector rows containing bright sources .",
    "no artifact correction was applied for 5.8 @xmath18 data , as its banding is less severe than at 8 @xmath18 , and it is not substantially improved by our procedure .",
    "we have also not made any extra corrections for 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath18 muxbleed artifacts ( see the irac data handbook ) , which appear as a decaying excess intensity in consecutive detector pixels sampled by a readout after sampling a very bright ( saturated ) source ( i.e. in every 4th pixel of a detector row following the saturated source ) .",
    "because the muxbleed effect is strictly periodic , i.e. a shah function ( bracewell 1986 ) in the spatial domain , it transforms to another shah function in the frequency domain .",
    "thus excess power is found at the fundamental frequency ( 0.25 pixels@xmath4 ) , and at the first harmonic which corresponds to the nyquist frequency ( 0.5 pixels@xmath4 ) .",
    "these spikes are evident at spatial scales of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the power spectra which are shown below .",
    "the slow decay of the muxbleed effect transforms to a slight broadening of the spikes in the power spectra .",
    "power at these scales is not important to the present research , in which the primary signal of interest is found at scales @xmath45 .",
    "this first step in the overall data processing flow is indicated in figure [ fig : flow ] .",
    "subsequent processing steps of source modeling and source masking ( see  3 ) , will additionally affect the photometry of the images to be analyzed",
    ".    continued improvements to the bcd pipeline since the kamm1 analysis now allow good results when starting with the bcd ( or corrected bcd , cbdc ) rather than the raw data .",
    "verification that similar power spectra are derived from either data set is presented in  4.3 .",
    "the extended groth strip observations are part of a large extragalactic gto project ( spitzer program i d number 8) .",
    "the full observations cover a @xmath46 region with a depth of 26 200-sec frames ( 1.4 hr ) , repeated after a 6month interval .",
    "the data are well  dithered for our purposes , using the medium  scale cycling pattern , which is based on a 2-dimensional gaussian distribution ( @xmath47 pixels ) of dither positions with a maximum offset of 119 pixels @xmath48 .",
    "our data reduction did not include the full data set , but only two @xmath49 portions of the strip , at both epochs .",
    "data from the two epochs were reduced separately .",
    "the data reduction was similar to that described above for the qso 1700 field , except that for these data ( and all subsequent data sets ) our analysis began with the individual bcd frames rather than the raw data .",
    "if an imperfect calibration , designated by @xmath50 is applied to the raw data , @xmath35 , then equation ( 1 ) becomes @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the bcd data , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath54 . in the last equation",
    "we make the approximations that @xmath55 constant so that we can ignore any dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath37 , and that @xmath57 constant so that we can ignore any dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath40 .",
    "thus the `` delta corrections '' to be derived and applied to the bcd data can be represented as simple offset terms , as in equation ( 1 ) , but now without a gain term in the equation .",
    "the data model that is applied when starting with the irac bcd frames can be represented as a slight variation on equation ( 1 ) : @xmath59 with no gain term , this model has the advantage that no contrasting data set ( e.g. the high zodiacal brightness field used with the qso 1700 data ) is required to separate degeneracies between gain and offset .",
    "any true gain errors that are present in the bcd data will be absorbed in the offset term @xmath39 , by assuming that @xmath60 is constant .",
    "the size of the errors made by approximating gain errors as offset errors are of order @xmath61 in a single bcd frame , where @xmath62 .",
    "the errors are reduced further by the square root of the number of dithered frames ( @xmath63 ) at each location ( @xmath64 frames for the deeper goods and qso 1700 fields ) .",
    "the fluctuations , @xmath65 , in the dominant zodiacal light and cirrus foregrounds are already estimated to be at or below the residual fluctuations ( see figure 1 of kamm1 ) .",
    "further reduction of these fluctuations by factors of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , irac data handbook ) and @xmath68 means that the approximation of gain errors as offset errors only affects results at levels @xmath69 of the detected signal .",
    "we note that the approximation would be more problematic if we were interested in accurate photometry of the brighter resolved sources , for which @xmath65 would be very large .      the goods legacy program ( program i d numbers 169 & 194 ) is designed to obtain very deep ,",
    "limited observations over small ( @xmath70 ) fields .",
    "the chosen fields are the hubble deep field ",
    "north ( hdfn ) and the chandra deep field  south ( cdfs ) , which is also the location of the hubble ultra deep field .",
    "these observations also used 200-sec frame times , and were carried out at two epochs separated by @xmath71 months . at the first epoch ( hdfn - e1 , cdfs - e1 ) , the two irac fields of view cover partially overlapping @xmath72 fields . at the second epoch ( hdfn - e2 , cdfs - e2 )",
    "the irac fields of view are reversed , thus providing complementary coverage .    for each channel",
    ", the bcd frames of each of the @xmath73 aors were processed separately to determine preliminary calibration factors , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "maps made from these calibrated data would show large systematic errors because there is no constraint between the aors to produce the same mean sky intensity .",
    "therefore , at each epoch , we also performed the self ",
    "calibration on the entire data set , but after downsizing the data set by performing @xmath76 pixel  averaging on each bcd frame ( resulting in @xmath77 pixel frames ) .",
    "the derived calibration parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 produce consistency across the entire data set , but with limited spatial resolution and with averaging over some real temporal variations ( between aors ) in the detector offsets ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "thus , we calibrated the frames of each aor using @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the 2dimensional linear gradient in the difference between the derived detector offsets .",
    "this combines the individual detail of the detector offsets ( @xmath74 ) derived for each aor , with the overall consistency provided ( via @xmath79 ) by simultaneous self ",
    "calibration of all aors .",
    "the extragalactic first look survey ( fls ; program i d number 26 ) is a shallow survey covering a @xmath83 field .",
    "observations used 12sec frame times with a depth of 5 exposures dithered with the small  scale gaussian pattern .",
    "these data were examined to explore larger spatial scales than the deeper data sets , despite the fact that the depth and the dithering are not especially well  suited for self  calibration .      for each of the data sets described above we mapped the artifact  corrected and self  calibrated bcd frames into final mosaics .",
    "the mapping procedure we used is an interlacing algorithm , where each pixel of the bcd frame is mapped into the pixel in the sky map that contains the center of the bcd pixel .",
    "this is similar to a drizzle algorithm with the `` pixfrac '' parameter set to zero ( fruchter & hook , 2002 ) .",
    "a desirable aspect of this mapping procedure is that it does not induce any pixel - to - pixel correlations in the noise , which does occur with procedures that map the flux of a single input pixel into multiple sky map pixels .",
    "another asset of this procedure is that it can easily create sky maps with pixel scales and orientations that are independent of the scale and orientation of the detector pixels .",
    "in general we prepared several variations of the final images .",
    "the most basic images are generated by mapping the entire data set into images with a scale of @xmath84/pixel ( the detector pixel scale ) .",
    "for the deeper data sets , we also produced images with scales of @xmath85/pixel .",
    "this allows slightly better discrimination of resolved point sources . for the goods and egs data sets ,",
    "the data from each epoch ( @xmath71 months apart ) were mapped into separate images .",
    "these images are useful as a check for systematic errors .",
    "finally , for all data sets we created `` a '' and `` b '' images by mapping all the even numbered frames from the sequence of exposures into the `` a '' image , and the odd numbered frames into the `` b '' image . any systematic errors should be manifested very similarly in the a and b images , and thus the ( a - b)/2 difference images provide a useful means of characterizing the random ( noise ) properties of the data sets .",
    "in this section we present the analysis procedures that are applied to the mosaicked irac images to derive the power spectra of the background .",
    "the analysis consist of two main parts : ( 1 ) removal of individually resolved sources via modeling and masking , and ( 2 ) calculation of the power spectra of the remaining background .",
    "these stages are shown in the overall data processing and analysis schematic flow chart in figure [ fig : flow ] .",
    "for clarity , this section is restricted to a direct description of the processes .",
    "there are several aspects of the analyses which can have significant effects on the results .",
    "tests of the effects that these processing details have on the final derived power spectra will be presented in  4 .      in order to study the spatial fluctuations of the unresolved extragalactic background emission",
    ", we must have a means of removing or ignoring the influence of the brighter , resolved galaxies and foreground stars .",
    "one such method is that the sources can be individually fit with a model and subtracted .",
    "practical difficulties with this approach are ( a ) limitations in the accuracy of the point response functions ( prfs ) , and ( b ) limitations in the modeling of sources that have resolved extended structure",
    ". small fractional errors in the prf or source model can result in large residuals at very bright sources .",
    "furthermore , the power spectrum of the residuals can exhibit different behavior than the power spectra of the original sources or the prf .",
    "a complementary approach is to mask the bright resolved sources in the images .",
    "depending on the type of analysis to be performed , the masked regions can either be ignored ( e.g. when computing correlation functions ) or else filled with zeros or noise at the appropriate level ( e.g. when computing power spectra ) .",
    "the difficulties in the masking approach are ( a ) for deep observations , masking all resolved sources including their extended wings ( both due to the prf and any extended emission ) can leave little or no data left for analysis , and ( b ) the masking will likely alter the shape of the calculated power spectrum of the image .    in our studies ,",
    "we apply both techniques .",
    "a source modeling procedure is used to ensure that the faintest resolved point sources and extended sources are removed from the images .",
    "masking is then applied to eliminate artifacts in the modeling and subtraction of only the brighter emission , thus minimize the influence of the masking on the power spectra .",
    "these steps are shown schematically in figure [ fig : flow ] .",
    "our source modeling procedure is conceptually similar to the clean algorithm , which is used to remove the effects of beam sidelobes in radio images ( hgbom 1974 ) .",
    "we start with the original image and a corresponding model image which is set to zero .",
    "the first step is to locate the brightest pixel in the original image . at that location",
    ", we subtract the irac prf , normalized such that the peak is a specified fraction @xmath86 of the pixel intensity .",
    "we _ add _ the same scaled prf to the corresponding location in the model image .",
    "this process is iterated by locating the brightest pixel in the modified image .",
    "the scaled prf is again subtracted from the image and added to the model .",
    "because only a fraction @xmath86 of a source ( a `` component '' ) is subtracted at each iteration , even a point source is modeled by multiple components .",
    "the residual flux of an ideal point source , matched by the prf , will be proportional to @xmath87 after subtraction of @xmath88 components .",
    "for our analysis we used @xmath89 , as a compromise between speed ( high values of @xmath86 ) and insensitivity to any prf errors ( low values of @xmath86 ; discussed below ) .",
    "so for the faintest sources , the residual emission of the point source is lost in the noise with @xmath90 .",
    "whereas for bright sources , several dozen components may be needed to reach the same level of residual emission .",
    "the loop of finding and subtracting components is repeated on order of 10@xmath91 times , depending on the number of resolved sources , the size of the image , and the value of @xmath86 .",
    "the total number of iterations is chosen so that the brightest pixels left in the image are approximately at the 3 @xmath92 noise level .",
    "we save the model after every @xmath93 iterations , so that we have a series of @xmath94 models at various depths .",
    "these can be examined afterwards to determine how the model - subtracted image varies as a function of model depth , and determine the optimal model depth .",
    "there are several important details to be noted in the modeling procedure .",
    "first is that the noise level is not completely uniform across the original image .",
    "therefore , we actually model an image that is weighted by the exposure depth , which produces an image with flat noise properties .",
    "this is equivalent to searching for the most significant , rather than the brightest , pixel in the image at each iteration .",
    "the model thus produced needs to be deweighted before subtraction from the data .",
    "the second important detail is that the choice of prf can be important .",
    "if the model prf is sharper ( narrower ) than the actual prf , then a point source will behave as an extended source , requiring subtraction of multiple components at slightly different positions , and thus the overall number of iterations would need to be increased . despite being slower , a good result should still be attained .",
    "if the model prf is too wide , however , the emission from point sources will be oversubtracted immediately around the source .",
    "this error is not recoverable , as we only are fitting components to the most significant positive pixels . because we are interested in faint background fluctuations",
    ", it is also important that our modeling procedure uses prfs that map the irac beam out to large angular distances , i.e. that it include the extended wings of the prf .",
    "if the wings are not included in the model prf , then the actual wings of sources in our image will not be modeled and removed , and may provide an undesired contribution to the power spectrum .",
    "the prf used in these studies was described in the in the supplementary information of kamm1 .",
    "it consists of the core psf ( measured out to a radius of @xmath95 ) which was made available by the ssc following the in - orbit checkout ( ioc ) , combined with the broad wings ( measured out to @xmath96 ) that were observed in long frame time observations of fomalhaut ( aorid = 6066432 ) .",
    "tests on the sensitivity of the power spectra to details of the adopted prf are presented in  4.2 .",
    "the third detail of the procedure is that it is important to set the correct background level in the original image .",
    "if the background level is set too low , then the apparent brightness of the sources will be set too high and sources may be oversubtracted , unless the parameter @xmath86 is set to a relatively small value .",
    "if the background is set too high , then sources will tend to be undersubtracted . in this case ,",
    "combined with relatively small values of @xmath86 , the model - subtracted data will appear to have had sources removed by truncation at a particular brightness level .",
    "the source masking of kamm1 was calculated iteratively from the original image .",
    "the mask is initially defined as all pixels with intensity more than @xmath97 above the mean intensity , and all pixels surrounding these within a square @xmath98 window .",
    "( the primary results of kamm1 used @xmath99 . )",
    "the process is then repeated with @xmath92 being replaced by @xmath100 ( derived only from the unmasked data ) , and newly identified pixels being added to the mask .",
    "after several iterations the procedure will converge and no unmasked pixels with intensities @xmath101 remain .",
    "the final result is very similar to masking the image at a fixed surface brightness threshold , and then expanding ( dilating or growing ) the mask to include the @xmath102 neighboring pixels .",
    "an additional detail of the masking procedure is that we also construct masks from the models ( described above ) , and then apply the union of both masks to the data analysis .",
    "this is done primarily to eliminate artifacts from ghost images .",
    "ghost images are generally weak in our images because of dithering combined with the fact that the position of the ghost image will shift as a function of the location of the source on the detector array . using the model to help insure they are masked increases the masked area by @xmath103 .    throughout the study",
    "we compute the power spectrum from fourier transforms for fields in which @xmath104 of the pixels are masked and set to 0.0 .",
    "as presented here , the two dimensional power @xmath105 of the model - subtracted and masked background intensity @xmath106 is simply derived from the discrete fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the image @xmath107|^2 = \\left|\\frac{1}{m}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{x=0}^{m-1}\\sum_{y=0}^{n-1}\\delta f(x , y)\\exp[-2\\pi i(ux / m+vy / n)]\\right|^2.\\ ] ] this is reduced to a power spectrum , @xmath108 , where @xmath109^{0.5}/\\theta_{pixel}$ ] , by averaging @xmath105 in bins with spatial frequencies in the ranges @xmath110 $ ] , where the bin width @xmath111 $ ] . for the binned power spectra ,",
    "uncertainties estimated for @xmath108 are calculated as the standard deviation of the mean for each bin . at the largest spatial scales ,",
    "both the power and its estimated uncertainty are subject to large errors due to the small number ( sometimes only 2 ) of independent measurements on these scales .",
    "we divide our power spectra by the fraction of pixels in the image that have not been masked ( masked areas are set to zero intensity ) .",
    "masking in the image domain corresponds to a convolution in the fourier transformed domain .",
    "if the power spectrum is a flat function of frequency , then its convolution with the fft of the mask will also be flat and unchanged ( after rescaling for the fractional area masked ) .",
    "for power spectra that are strongly peaked at low frequencies ( large spatial scales ) , the convolution produced by the masking shifts some of the power to higher frequencies , leading to underestimates of the large scale power . in  4.2 we show that this shift in power does not qualitatively affect our results , with the largest change being a reduction in power at the largest spatial scales by approximately the same fraction as the masked area of the image .",
    "our power spectra are plotted as a function of @xmath112 which is the spatial wavelength .",
    "because of the constrained detector orientation ( position angle ) during any given set of _ spitzer _ observations , the self  calibration procedure can not distinguish between strictly linear gradients in the sky and correlated gradients in the detector offsets @xmath39 and @xmath41 .",
    "such gradients can be caused by calibration errors , zodiacal light , or the true astronomical background . in any case , to ensure that they have no effect , we omit the data along the @xmath113 and @xmath114 axes of the fourier transformed image when calculating @xmath108 .",
    "this is done by simply omitting measurements @xmath105 where @xmath115 or @xmath116 when constructing @xmath117}$ ] as described above .",
    "doing so means that we obtain no result for the largest spatial scale ( smallest @xmath118 ) that could be measured in principle , and the results at other large spatial scales are made slightly more uncertain . omitting the power measured along the axis also eliminates the effects of many systematic errors , which tend to be aligned with the detector and thus are preferentially found along the axes of the 2-dimensional fourier transform of the image .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : zero_axes ] .",
    "unless otherwise noted , all power spectra shown in this paper do not include power on the axes .    for comparison with",
    "the original images and the brightnesses of the resolved sources in the images , it is sometimes convenient to display the fluctuation spectrum , which is defined as @xmath119^{0.5}$ ] .",
    "in this section we present several tests aimed at identifying possible problems in the analysis of the clipped and model - subtracted background fluctuation .",
    "table [ tab : checks ] is provided as a summary of the tests presented below and in our prior reports .",
    "an assessment of the usefulness of the self - calibration can be made by examining images of the derived array offsets @xmath39 and the temporal trends of the variable offsets @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ fig : offsets ] shows the array offsets @xmath39 derived at 3.6 @xmath18 for each of the aors of the cdfs  e1 observations .",
    "these offsets display a relatively constant pattern of dark features .",
    "these represent long  term changes in the detector response compared to the standard gains and offsets applied by the bcd pipeline .",
    "there are both spotty features that likely represent long term latent images from previous observations , and a horizontal linear feature ( about 64 pixels from the bottom of the detector array ) that is more directly related to the hardware . additionally , there are short",
    " term detector changes that appear as white spots and lines .",
    "these are caused by staring at or slewing over bright sources in the time preceding the aor where they appear .",
    "these features decay relatively quickly , affecting no more than 3 consecutive aors .",
    "the detectors at 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath18 are not strongly affected by latent images , but at all wavelengths the self  calibration does find array offsets with fairly fixed patterns along with variable features that can change from one aor to another .",
    "thus with the self  calibration , we remove these artifacts as appropriate for each aor .",
    "the self  calibration also derives variable offset terms @xmath41 .",
    "example of these offsets at each wavelength are shown for the cdfs - e1 observations in figure [ fig : quads ] . in this figure , each of the four @xmath41 values per frame is plotted ( dots ) as a function of time ( in days ) since the start of the observations of this field .",
    "the self - calibration assumes that the sky is a stable calibration source .",
    "however , since the zodiacal light intensity does change on a time scale of days , this variation is absorbed by the @xmath41 term in the self - calibration .",
    "thus , the figure shows a steady drift in @xmath41 which is well  correlated with the change in the zodiacal light intensity ( solid line ) .",
    "the infrequent but nearly periodic outliers are evidence of incomplete correction of the offsets in the initial frame of each observing sequence ( the `` first frame effect '' ) .",
    "other smaller scale ( @xmath120d ) drifts and jumps with resect to the zodiacal light trend are likely caused by instrumental changes , because their strength does not vary with wavelength as would be expected if they were caused by short - term variations in the zodiacal light .",
    "the clustering of points in time simply reflects the scheduling of the observations .",
    "the differences made by application of the self - calibration to the data are often small compared to the brightness of typical sources in the images .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to see the effect of self - calibration on a full - intensity image .",
    "however , the effects become very evident when examining certain processed results in which the appearance of the point sources is minimized .",
    "ratio images between our self  calibrated mosaics , and those prepared by the goods team show evident differences , but in such images it can be difficult to determine which of the original images is causing which artifacts in the ratio .",
    "a more decisive comparison can be made by examining the ratio of mosaics at two wavelengths for the self - calibration , and the corresponding ratio for the goods pipeline processed data .",
    "artifacts in these ratio maps are definitely the fault of the corresponding data reduction , although here it may be ambiguous as to which wavelength ( if not both ) contains the flaws . in constructing these ratios ,",
    "we add small offsets ( @xmath121 times the noise level ) to the data such that the ratios are always positive and the noise does not dominate the appearance . figure [ fig : compare12 ] shows the ratio images of 4.5 / 3.6 @xmath18 mosaics for our self - calibrated data , and for the goods processed data ( v0.3 ) . also shown",
    "are the median intensities of each ratio , taken across rows and columns . masking is applied to the bright sources to eliminate the distraction of the intrinsic color variations of some of these sources .",
    "the comparison shows that while neither ratio is perfectly flat , the self - calibrated data show significantly less large  scale structure .",
    "here it is very clear that the goods result contains an artifact related to the coverage of the field , whereas the self - calibrated result is much flatter .",
    "this difference can be traced to a gradient in the detector offset that we identify and remove through the self - calibration process ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "the corresponding ratio images for 8 / 5.8 @xmath18 are shown in figure [ fig : compare34 ] .",
    "an important aspect of the source modeling procedure (  3.1.1 ) is the determination of the optimal depth of the model . for the results presented here , we have chosen the optimal depth to be that where the residual intensities ( after clipping and subtraction of the model ) exhibit zero skewness [ i.e. the normalized third moment of the distribution : @xmath122",
    "this is because any true sky sources contribute to the positive tail of the distribution , whereas the noise is expected to have zero skewness .",
    "we note , however , that the final results are very similar if we use our prior criteria , such as either the iteration where negligible correlation with removed emissions is reached , or when the shot noise from the remaining sources is sufficiently larger than the @xmath123 estimate of the instrument noise so that no significant amount of the instrument noise is removed in the modeling .",
    "figure [ fig : skewness ] shows the change in skewness of the pixel intensities for our modeled fields as function of the mean density of components . the density of components is the number of components subtracted by the model , divided by the area of the field .",
    "this quantity is related to the density of sources in the field , however because multiple components are required to model each source (  3.1.1 ) , the actual density of sources in the images is several times lower . if the modeling is not sufficiently deep , remaining point sources leave a positive skew in the distribution of the residual intensities .",
    "if the model is too deep , the highest noise peaks begin to get subtracted , and the residual intensities develop a negative skew .",
    "figures [ fig : figure5_cdfs_ep1]-[fig : figure5_egs ] show the changes in the fluctuation spectra as a function of model depth for several fields . at 3.6 and 4.5",
    "@xmath18 , there are large changes in the residual fluctuation as a function of model depth on medium and large scales .",
    "changes are small at the smallest angular scales ( @xmath124 ) , which are instrument noise dominated . at these wavelengths",
    "it is relatively difficult for the models to fit the fluctuations down to the noise level on all scales .",
    "this indicates significant structure in the images , but does not reveal whether the structure is astronomical , or rather an instrument or data artifact . at 5.8 and 8 @xmath18 changes in the fluctuations with model depth",
    "are less pronounced .",
    "the noisier fields ( egs and qso 1700 ) can be modeled down to the ( a - b)/2 noise level (  2.5 ) and lower .",
    "in the goods fields , after approximately zero skewness is reached , power at intermediate scales ( @xmath125 ) begins to rise , as the model starts to imprint a ( negative ) prf into a formerly random unstructured noise background .",
    "we tested several other criteria for selection of the optimal model depth .",
    "these included the correlation coefficients between ( a ) the model @xmath126 at iteration @xmath127 and the residual intensity @xmath128 , ( b ) the change in the models @xmath129 and the residual intensity @xmath128 , ( c ) the model @xmath126 at iteration @xmath127 and the original intensity @xmath130 , ( d ) the change in the models @xmath129 and the original intensity @xmath130 . the former two correlation coefficients generally change from positive to negative at approximately the same depth as the skewness .",
    "however , these correlations are more strongly affected than the skewness by the initial zero level used in the modeling procedure .",
    "the latter two criteria are less suitable as they tend to asymptotically approach 1 and 0 respectively .",
    "we emphasize again that for the final iterations there are negligible correlations between the modeled sources and the source - subtracted maps .",
    "another important aspect of the modeling procedure is that the correct prfs are used .",
    "if the prf core or wings are too broad , point sources will be poorly fit , generally oversubtracted in the outer portions and undersubtracted in the inner portions .",
    "a too narrow prf core is less of a problem , but will require a larger number of model components to fit each source . if the prf wings are too weak compared to the true prf , then it will be impossible to remove faint large - scale structure of bright point sources . to investigate the sensitivity of the residual emission to the prf shape , we constructed models for the cdfs fields at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath18 using prfs that are raised to the 0.95 and 1.05 powers to effectively widen and narrow the prf respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : figure6_prf ] shows that using the narrower prf has little effect on the results , but does require additional model iterations ( @xmath131 more ) . at 3.6 @xmath18 , the models using the wider prf require ( @xmath131 ) fewer iterations , but leave an increased level of fluctuations in the residual intensity .",
    "however , at 4.5 @xmath18 the wider prf produces similar results to those obtained with the nominal prf .",
    "this indicates that our nominal 4.5 @xmath18 prfs are slightly too narrow and/or have somewhat weaker wings than the true 4.5 @xmath18 prf .    to investigate the effect that the source masking has on the derived power",
    ", we constructed a set of 160 simulations of fields the same size as the hdfn and cdfs .",
    "the simulated fields include : ( 1 ) a flat instrument noise component , ( 2 ) a shot noise component ( flat at large scale and rolled off at small scale by the prf ) representing faint unresolved sources , and ( 3 ) a structured background ( a power law at large scales , but also rolled off by the prf at small scales ) .",
    "individually resolved sources were omitted from the simulation so that the effects on the structured background would be more clearly displayed .",
    "one example of a simulated image is shown in figure [ fig : figure_sim_images ] .",
    "the figure also shows the same simulation after masking roughly 5 , 10 and 25% of the area .",
    "the latter mask is taken from the actual data .",
    "the other masks are versions that are processed to reduce to masked area .",
    "these masks were applied to each of the 160 simulations , and the power spectra were calculated .",
    "the mean of these power spectra are shown in figure [ fig : figure_mask_test2 ] . when the power spectra are plotted on logarithmic axes , the effects of the masking appear to be very minor . when the power spectra of the masked simulations are normalized by those of the unmasked simulations , the differences become more apparent .",
    "increased masking reduces the power at the largest scales by approximately the same fraction as the masked area .",
    "there is a less significant increase in the power at small spatial scales .",
    "the figure also shows that the masking is not the cause of any excess power along the axes of the fourier transformed images .",
    "other tests of the effects of the clipping were performed using the actual images .",
    "figures [ fig : figure_mask1]-[fig : figure_mask4 ] show the fluctuation spectra for the cdfs epoch 1 and epoch 2 fields , for several variations of the clipping mask at a fixed model depth . when the clipping mask is expanded by one or two pixels ( i.e.",
    "the clipped regions are increased in size ) using a mathematical erosion operator , there is very little change in the fluctuation spectrum . in most cases the largest changes are less than the 1@xmath92 uncertainties .",
    "the changes are similarly small when the clipping mask is reduced in size by 1 pixel using a mathematical dilation operator , with the exception of a small but significant increase in the fluctuation amplitude at scales @xmath132 . when the clipping mask is reduced in size by 2 pixels ,",
    "many faint sources are no longer subject to any blanking at all .",
    "this creates large increases in the signal at the smaller angular scales , especially at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath18 where the faintest sources blanked by the standard masking are well above the instrument noise limits .",
    "the final masking test involved the additional masking by randomly located @xmath133 pixel patches .",
    "such masks were generated in which 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , or 50% of the pixels were masked .",
    "these masks were applied in addition to the standard clipping masks .",
    "the results ( shown in the right - hand panels of figures [ fig : figure_mask1]-[fig : figure_mask4 ] ) are similar to those of the simulations above .",
    "as the total are masked is increase , the power at the largest spatial scales decreases proportionally with the fractional area that is not masked , while the power at small spatial scales remains unaffected .      as a check on the possible systematic errors in the power ( or fluctuation ) spectra of the data",
    ", we have calculated power ( or fluctuation ) spectra for various artificial images that are related to different aspects of the analysis .",
    "similarities between the measured and artificial power spectra can indicate possible errors .    in figure",
    "[ fig : beams ] , we present the power spectra of the irac prfs that we used in the source modeling procedure .",
    "any real signal from the sky will be convolved by the prf and thus its power spectrum will be multiplied by those shown here .",
    "the prf will reduce power by factors larger than 2 on scales @xmath132 at 3.6 @xmath18 to @xmath134 at 8 @xmath18 .",
    "power arising from other sources ( e.g. instrumental noise ) will not be modulated ( multiplied ) by the prf power spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : dither ] shows artificial images constructed by distributing delta functions in the same pattern as the dithering and the ( 2@xmath422 ) raster mapping used for the cfds - e1 field at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath18 . if power along the axes were included , the corresponding power spectra of these images would show a strong feature at @xmath135 , corresponding to the offset between the 4 raster pointings of the map . when the power on the axes is excluded ( as in the figure ) ,",
    "excess power is eliminated at @xmath136 , and is reduced at smaller spatial scales .",
    "this sort of feature is not directly present in the power spectra of any field .",
    "however , most instrumental errors will be much more highly structured than a delta function .",
    "as an example of such an error we took the detector offsets ( @xmath39 and @xmath41 ) derived from the self - calibration of the full data set at half - resolution , and repeatedly added them to a blank sky in the same pattern as the dithering .",
    "this creates images representing the errors that would be present had we not removed the detector offsets via the self - calibration .",
    "these are shown in figure [ fig : dither_offsets ] along with the corresponding power spectra .",
    "both power spectra can be approximated as the sum of a flat white  noise component and a steeply rising power law component with an index of 2.3 - 2.4 .",
    "this rising component is steeper than that seen in the power spectra of the actual sky . at 4.5 @xmath18 ,",
    "the turnover at @xmath137 is hidden by large scale power represented in the @xmath41 offsets .",
    "the amplitudes of these power spectra are large enough that they would contribute significantly to the result if we had not self - calibrated the data .",
    "in fact the pattern seen here in the 3.6 @xmath18 offsets is largely responsible for that seen in the ratio of the 3.6/4.5 @xmath18 data reduced by the goods team ( see figure [ fig : compare12 ] ) .",
    "other artificial images that we have examined are based on the actual sky instead of the instrument and observing strategy .",
    "the first of these test images is constructed by applying the complement of the clipping mask to the original sky map .",
    "this creates an image consisting of only the bright sources , with the background set to 0.0 between them .",
    "the power spectrum of this image serves as a check on any large scale structure that may be intrinsic to the distribution of the bright sources .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : power_mask_cdfse1]-[fig : power_mask_egs ] ( blue lines ) , where we have renormalized these power spectra to match the observed spectra at @xmath138 . in all cases",
    ", there is no excess power at large spatial scales .",
    "the second sky - based test is to calculate the power spectrum of the mask itself .",
    "this is similar to the previous test , but it removes the effective weighting with source brightness , which is present in the previous test .",
    "the results are shown as the red lines in figures [ fig : power_mask_cdfse1]-[fig : power_mask_egs ] , where they have been arbitrarily normalized to the observed power spectra at angular scales @xmath139 .",
    "while the power spectrum of the mask has a large scale shape similar to the data , the mask is uncorrelated with the residual fluctuations , and subtracting any scaled version of the mask only _",
    "increases _ the large scale power .",
    "a more complex test image was created by setting the intensity to be the inverse of the distance from the nearest blanked region of the mask .",
    "this `` halo '' image simulates the extended wings of bright sources that would remain after the application of a simple masking defined strictly by a surface brightness threshold .",
    "removal of such wings , whether intrinsic to the source or caused by the prf , are a large part of the motivation for the model we subtract . this simulated image can test whether the model over- or under - subtracts such features .",
    "we scaled these test images using the slopes of linear correlations between these and the model - subtracted images .",
    "correlations were generally weak , though statistically significant .",
    "the power spectra of the test images are shown as green lines in figures [ fig : power_mask_cdfse1]-[fig : power_mask_egs ] . in all cases",
    "the power is not more than @xmath140 of the power of the actual background .",
    "( in some cases the power is below the minimum range in the plots . )",
    "one additional check illustrated in figure [ fig : power_mask_qso ] is the comparison of the 3.6 @xmath18 power spectrum derived when starting with the raw data ( as described in  2.2 ) and the power spectrum derived when the processing starts with the latest version ( s18.7.0 ) of the bcd data .",
    "the two power spectra show only small differences ( @xmath141 ) at the smallest angular scales and at large angular scales ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "more significant , though still small , differences occur at angular scales @xmath143 .",
    "these scales are typically dominated by the shot noise ( see next section ) , which is sensitive to the depth of the source model that is subtracted .",
    "the source models were calculated independently for the mosaics derived from the raw and the bcd data .",
    "in this section we characterize the final power spectra for each field and each wavelength by fitting the power spectra with empirical models with 3 or 4 free parameters . to the extent that these models provide good fits",
    ", the derived parameters may provide a simpler means of representing the power spectra .",
    "our idealized model of the power spectrum includes three components : instrument noise , shot noise , and a power law . for this model",
    "we assume instrument noise has a flat spectrum , with the normalization as its only free parameter .",
    "this is expected if there are no correlations in the response of the detector pixels .",
    "the shot noise is intended to represent the random poisson statistics of sources below the confusion limit .",
    "intrinsically this component is also flat .",
    "however , as the observed sky is unavoidably convolved by the prf , this component is correspondingly modulated by the power spectrum of the prf , which greatly reduces power at small angular scales .",
    "this component also has only its normalization as a free parameter .",
    "the power - law component is included to represent any excess power at large angular scales .",
    "it is also modulated by the power spectrum of the prf , and contains two free parameters : a normalization and the power law index .",
    "this flat noise model can be expressed as : @xmath144    a slightly different model was also fit , in which the flat noise was replaced by the measured a - b noise spectrum . in this case the normalization is fixed , and there is no free parameter associated with this component .",
    "@xmath145    using the a - b noise spectrum instead of a flat instrument noise ( assumed above ) is an improvement if the structure in the a - b spectrum is purely instrumental , and does not include any astronomical component or systematic errors .",
    "the parameters ( and formal uncertainties ) derived via these fits are presented in tables [ tab : fit_params ] and [ tab : fit_covars ] .",
    "figures [ fig : fit_plots1 ] - [ fig : fit_plots4 ] show the results graphically .",
    "the uncertainties listed in table [ tab : fit_params ] are the formal uncertainties for the given parameters .",
    "however , table [ tab : fit_covars ] shows that in many cases there is significant covariance between parameters , and thus assessing agreement or disagreement of results in different fields requires caution .    at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath18 ,",
    "the limiting factor in the results is the instrument noise , as characterized by @xmath146 . as the instrument noise decreases from field to field , the shot noise ( after subtracting the source model to reach zero skewness ) decreases correspondingly .",
    "the egs and fls fields differ from the overall trend because they have been mapped with @xmath147 pixels , rather than @xmath148 pixels .",
    "therefore , the noise at the pixel scale is reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "this allows the pixel - based source modeling to run to fainter levels , leading to a corresponding decrease in the shot noise in the residual image .",
    "the amplitude of the power law component decreases as the shot noise decreases .",
    "this indicates that a large fraction of the power seen in the shallower fields ( qso 1700 , and egs ) arises from faint sources , which are modeled and removed in the deeper goods fields .",
    "if the goods fields are only model - subtracted to the same shot noise level as the qso 1700 or egs fields , then they have a power law component with a comparable amplitude to the shot noise in the qso 1700 and egs fields .",
    "results at 5.8 and 8 @xmath18 , are more erratic because in some cases the best - fit parameters include a negligible amplitude for one of the components . in such cases",
    "there are also extremely large covariances between the parameters . aside from the anomalous cases ,",
    "it is apparent that the power law component at these wavelength is steeper than that at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath18 .",
    "final power spectra are compared in figure [ fig : final_power ] , and in figure [ fig : final_power_norm ] the spectra are all normalized to match that of cdfs - e1 at @xmath149 .",

    "the reduced @xmath150 values for the comparison of these normalized power spectra are given in table [ tab : chi_norm ] .",

    "if these populations originate at high @xmath7 their emissions below the lyman break , at rest wavelengths @xmath261 m , should effectively have been absorbed by the local igm ( santos et al 2002 , schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "thus one should probe the level of residual diffuse light at wavelengths @xmath262 m and see if they correlate with the source - subtracted cib maps at irac bands .",
    "progress here has been made by in kamm4 where it was shown that the maps of deep acs sources in goods observations exhibit completely negligible correlations with the source - subtracted maps at irac wavelengths .",
    "this likely places the sources producing the kamm signal at @xmath263 unless they originate in extremely low - luminosity local galaxies with @xmath264 that somehow escaped the acs source catalog detection .",
    "still , it would be desirable to compare directly the residual diffuse light maps in visible bands with those observed by irac .",
    "( the levels of residual maps artifacts in the acs maps have prevented kamm4 from doing such direct comparison ) .",
    "[ fig : future_ak ] ( right panel ) shows the estimated ism ( cirrus ) spectra in our deep fields and the lockman hole ( a region of minimum column density ) .",
    "emission from small grains and pahs in the ism rises sharply at wavelengths @xmath265 @xmath18 . at wavelengths of @xmath266 @xmath18 the extended red emission ( ere ; gordon et al .",
    "1998 ) , is the likely limiting factor , with the directly scattered starlight being an underlying continuum at all wavelengths .",
    "though _ spitzer _ is incapable of observing at shorter wavelengths , ciber will perform its fluctuation measurements at 0.8 and 1.6 @xmath18 , and also includes a low resolution spectrometer to search for a lyman break redshifted into the cib .",
    "the wide field camera 3 on the _ hubble space telescope _ and the nircam instrument on the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ should also provide good opportunities to extend cib fluctuation studies to short wavelengths .",
    "finally , kamm have already reached very low residual shot noise levels of @xmath267 nw@xmath268 m@xmath269 sr@xmath4 at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath18 and there is tentative evidence that the clustering signal already starts diminishing as lower levels of the shot noise are reached .",
    "this may imply that in our modeling we are already beginning to remove the very populations producing the large - scale fluctuations .",
    "this is not surprising since as shown in kamm3 and discussed above , the low levels of the shot noise coupled with the relatively significant levels of the arcminute scales source - subtracted cib fluctuations , imply that the sources producing the latter must have individual fluxes @xmath270 njy .",
    "this is already in the range of fluxes expected even for population iii systems as fig .",
    "[ fig : colors_ak ] shows .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to expect that mapping a suitable region of up to @xmath271 on the side with sufficiently long integrations ( @xmath272 100 hr / pixel ) should reach the shot noise levels , @xmath273 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 where the clustering component of the cib disappears completely , or is significantly diminished .",
    "this would then probe the flux levels of the individual sources producing the kamm signal at arcminute scales . at this depth _",
    "spitzer _ becomes limited by confusion .",
    "however , with its much larger aperture , _ jwst _ will not be limited by confusion until much fainter levels , and should provide a much clearer picture of the clustering of very faint sources on angular scale @xmath274 .",
    "this paper provides the details behind our prior analysis ( kamm1  kamm4 ) of the spatial fluctuations or power spectrum of the cib .",
    "we show the extent to which the final results do or do not depend on the details of the data reduction and analysis .    for various deep _",
    "irac data sets , we show that the self - calibration that we apply to the data effectively removes spatial and temporal artifacts well enough to probe fluctuations in the source - subtracted cib down to levels well below @xmath275 nw / m@xmath268/sr on arcminute angular scales . some of the relatively strong and large  scale artifacts that we remove are seen to be present in the current v0.30 release of the independently processed goods data",
    ". the self - calibration procedure does not add artificial spatial correlations to the data .",
    "we describe in detail the masking and modeling of the resolved sources .",
    "various checks on these procedures involving either modest changes in their parameters , or the construction of test images demonstrate that the cib fluctuations are not directly related to sources that could be identified above the sensitivity ( or confusion ) limits of the given observations .",
    "table [ tab : checks ] itemizes the tests performed .    at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath18 the residual cib fluctuations",
    "can be reasonably characterized using 2 components : shot noise , produced by the variance of sources too faint to be individually detected ( dominant at small scales ) ; and a clustered component which dominates on scales @xmath0 . as a simplified representation of the power spectra of each field , we provide the parameters of fitting each power spectrum with these components , plus either a flat noise spectrum or an empirical estimate of the instrument noise .",
    "we summarized the requirements that must be met by studies of such faint cosmological signals .",
    "we reiterate that the sources producing the large scale signal must have a very small shot noise component , while contributing significant fluctuations on arcminute scales .",
    "the latter component can be reasonably fit by a high-@xmath7 population within a @xmath12cdm concordance model , with net cib fluxes at 3.5 and 4.5 @xmath161 m of @xmath276 nw / m@xmath268sr .",
    "the low levels of the shot noise imply that individual sources producing the large scale cib fluctuations must be individually very faint , @xmath277 njy .",
    "we then demonstrate that this population and its cib level is consistent with the available data on high - energy @xmath6-ray absorption , and hst nicmos data on cib and its colors .",
    "finally , we discuss future prospects for testing the nature of the cib fluctuations : the currently approved seds survey in warm spitzer mission would enable us to extend the measurements to sub - degree scales and probe the peak in the spatial spectrum of the fluctuations at @xmath278 expected from a high-@xmath7 population in the @xmath12cdm concordance cosmology .",
    "deeper irac integrations over a smaller region are recommended in that they could detect the shot noise levels where the clustering component disappears or is appreciably diminished ; this would identify the flux range of the individual sources contributing to the latter .",
    "we point out that , while diffuse light measurements below 1 @xmath18 could in principle probe the lyman break of these populations , such measurements may be limited by increased levels of scattered galactic starlight light ( and extended red emission ) in the ism .",

    "<S> spitzer _ </S>",
    "<S> irac observations . </S>",
    "<S> the self - calibration we apply removes a strong instrumental signal from the fluctuations which would otherwise corrupt our results . </S>",
    "<S> the procedures and results for masking bright sources , and modeling faint sources down to levels set by the instrumental noise are presented . </S>",
    "<S> various tests are performed to demonstrate that the resulting power spectra of these fields are not dominated by instrumental or procedural effects . </S>",
    "<S> these tests indicate that the large scale ( @xmath0 ) fluctuations that remain in the deepest fields are not directly related to the galaxies that are bright enough to be individually detected . </S>",
    "<S> we provide the parameterization of these power spectra in terms of separate instrument noise , shot noise , and power law components . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relationship between fluctuations measured at different wavelengths and depths , and the relations between constraints on the mean intensity of the cib and its fluctuation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with growing evidence that the @xmath1 mean intensity of the cib may not be as far above the integrated emission of resolved galaxies as has been reported in some analyses of dirbe and _ irts _ observations , our measurements of spatial fluctuations of the cib intensity indicate the mean emission from the objects producing the fluctuations is quite low ( @xmath2 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 at @xmath5 ) , and thus consistent with current @xmath6-ray absorption constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the source of the fluctuations may be high-@xmath7 population iii objects , or a more local component of very low luminosity objects with clustering properties that differ from the resolved galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the prospects of the upcoming space - based surveys to directly measure the epochs inhabited by the populations producing these source - subtracted cib fluctuations , and to isolate the individual fluxes of these populations . </S>"
