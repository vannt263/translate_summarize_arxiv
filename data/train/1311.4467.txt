    "symmetries play a fundamental role in physics .",

    "the so - called `` gauging a theory '' is a physical deformation / change procedure in which an initial action characterizing a physical system is transformed into an inequivalent new one , with new gauge groups that include new interactions in the system .",
    "the initial un - deformed theory possesses some global symmetries that are promoted into local ones in the final theory .",
    "the new action contains these new local symmetries by means of a minimal coupling of the matter fields with a gauge field ( connection ) .",

    "the sculpting gauging is an alternative proposal based on extracting a gauge symmetry by modifying the initial theory imposing some topological restrictions on the action .",
    "it is formulated in terms of bundles . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis in @xcite and @xcite , and provide two new examples ( section 3 , examples one and two ) . in section 3 example three , we extend previous analysis @xcite , and explain each step in the process of topological change and deformation of the supermembrane bundle .",
    "section 4 , is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in addition we give general remarks about the scheme to follow to implement this sculpting procedure to the cases of a d4-brane worldvolume action .",
    "in a geometric context @xcite , the fields of a physical field theory are often sections on vector bundles @xmath0 , associated to a principal g - bundle @xmath1 .",
    "these construction however can be generalized to arbitrary fiber bundles -as we will see along the examples of section 3 , in which the sections act on manifold bundles- . in the initial formulation ,",
    "the vector bundles are typically taken trivial .",
    "the action integral of a physical theory is a functional @xmath2 defined on sections @xmath3 acting on associated bundles @xmath4 , @xmath5 , which are invariant under certain global symmetries .",
