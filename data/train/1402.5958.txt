    "this is achieved by engineering electrically small particles which respond to electromagnetic excitations as electric and magnetic dipoles in the desired way .",

    "the main motivation of this research are recent discoveries of extreme properties of nonreciprocal bianisotropic particles @xcite , such as extreme asymmetry in scattering response ( invisible from one of the directions , optimal absorption from the opposite direction , etc ) .",
    "it has been understood that planar arrays of small nonreciprocal bianisotropic particles with special values of the coupling coefficients can be used as transparent absorbing boundaries @xcite ( which were introduced earlier for the termination of computational domains in finite - element methods @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , such arrays can be applied for novel implementations of perfect electromagnetic isolators @xcite , twist polarizers @xcite , thin - sheet phase shifters , and other devices .",
    "artificial moving medium with properly chosen values of the material parameters can transform electromagnetic fields in a very general manner @xcite .",
    "however , at this time all these applications are only theoretical predictions",
    ". scatterers with the desired parameter values do not exist in nature , and there are no known realizations of nonreciprocal bianisotropic meta - atoms . in this paper",

    "the results show that desired novel effects can be achieved in particles made of conventional materials and having reasonable dimensions .",
    "nonreciprocity of media in applied dc magnetic fields or media with spontaneous magnetization is a common place in classical electrodynamics .",
    "this nonreciprocity obviously implies anisotropy of the medium and is related to the off - diagonal components of the permittivity ( magneto - optical media , magnetized plasmas ) or permeability ( gyrotropic media , e.g. ferrites ) dyadics . on the other hand ,",
    "nonreciprocal effects in bianisotropic media due to nonreciprocal nature of magnetoelectric interactions in the medium ( see e.g. in @xcite ) are very rare and very weak .",
    "for example , the tellegen coupling has been observed in some antiferromagnetic crystals at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the metamaterial concept is the only possible route towards realization of nonreciprocal particles offering the theoretically expected extreme performance .    in 1948",

    ", the gyrator element corresponds to a nonreciprocal particle with nonzero trace of @xmath10 , and to composite media ( tellegen s medium ) performed as a random mixture of such particles .",
    "ari sihvola conceptualized a microscopic particle with permanent electric and magnetic dipole moments parallel to one another and linked by a non - electromagnetic force @xcite .",
    "coupling of electric and magnetic polarizations in such composite is of nonreciprocal nature .",
    "however , practical possibilities to create the tellegen particle and medium remain problematic . in 1996 , e. o. kamenetskii @xcite suggested magneto - static ferrite resonators shaped as tablets with partial metallization ( shaped as a strip ) on one side of the tablet as a conceptual nonreciprocal bianisotropic particle .",
    "ferrite disks of small sizes compared to the wavelength operate as very compact resonators of magneto - static waves because of dramatic shortening of these waves compared to the electromagnetic wave in free space at the same frequency . in that work kamenetskii predicted that a chain of such tablets should operate as a nonreciprocal bianisotropic waveguide @xcite .",
    "he has shown that it should be possible to obtain controllable coupling coefficient of nonreciprocal tablets simply by tuning the bias magnetic field . in 1998 v. dmitriev",
    "@xcite generalized the results by kamenetskii to a hypothetic medium which represented an anisotropic variant of the tellegen medium and showed topologies which correspond to the other fundamental class of nonreciprocal bianisotropic coupling : the `` moving '' particle . in 1998 ,",

    "the group of tretyakov experimentally confirmed the existence of nonreciprocal magnetoelectric coupling @xcite in one of the configurations introduced in @xcite , but in that work the particle polarizability value was not determined , and there is no model to predict and optimize the particle response . in the present paper",

    "in this example we have assumed that the long parts of the wires ( @xmath20 ) are large compared to @xmath71 , but small compared to the wavelength .",
    "hence , we need to decrease the resonance frequency used in the example of the tellegen - omega particle ( 10 ghz ) to be able to increase the value of @xmath20 , so that the wavelength would be still larger than the size of particle .",
    "therefore , 2.5 ghz can be a reasonable choice , corresponding the wavelength 120 mm .",

    "as it is clear in the figures , there is a very small difference in the resonance frequency between the analytical and the simulated results .",
    "that can be because of inaccuracy in calculating the applied bias field for having the resonance at 2.5 ghz .",
    "however , it is thought that the main source of that shift is in inaccuracies of determining the reactive part of the input impedances of the wire elements .",
    "the analytical polarizabilities : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are nicely matched in value and behavior with the simulated results .",

    "in fact , with the structure of our particle , there are also couplings of the other two types : tellegen and omega , in addition to the moving and chiral ones . the fundamental reason for existing tellegen and omega coupling effects are the central ( short ) parts of the wires close to the ferrite inclusion .",
    "therefore , we observe mixing of all four coupling phenomena and not a pure moving - chiral particle . looking at the simulated results for electro - magnetic and magneto - electric polarizabilities , we see that this is more pronounced in the numerical results .",
    "we think that in addition to this topology effect , the long arms of the wires are very close to the ferrite inclusion and they can create parasitic effects in the ferrite sphere excitation ( due to strong non - uniformity of the fields ) . in theory we have not taken into account these parasitic effects , and therefore the differences of the numerical electro - magnetic and magneto - electric polarizabilities and the theoretical ones are not negligible . hence , we should find a way to reduce the impact of the long arms of the wires , and one possible solution is moving them further away from the ferrite sphere by increasing the length of the central part of the wires .",
    "we have studied an example case with @xmath84 mm . as mentioned before ,",
    "@xmath20 is assumed to be much larger than @xmath71 .",
    "to realize this , we suppose that @xmath20 is six times larger than @xmath71 , which gives @xmath85 mm .",
    "because the size of the particle should be much smaller than the wavelength , we replace 2.5 ghz with 2 ghz as the resonance frequency .",
    "the corresponding applied bias field will be 714 oe . fig .",
    "[ fig:10002 ] presents the real and imaginary parts of the electro - magnetic and the magneto - electric polarizabilities obtained analytically and numerically for this example .",

    "still because of inevitable inaccuracies , a little difference exists in the resonance frequencies .",
    "the parasitic effects have been mainly removed but , naturally , the tellegen and omega coupling effects remain significant .",
    "in this work , we have applied the antenna theory concepts ( for electrically small short - circuit wire antennas ) and the knowledge about electromagnetic properties of ferrite materials to derive analytically the electric , magnetic , electro - magnetic and magneto - electric polarizabilities of two artificial nonreciprocal bianisotropic particles , named tellegen - omega and moving - chiral . in these particles ,",

    "we hope to confirm the analytical and numerical polarizabilities also experimentally . by developing waveguide measurement techniques and placing such particles inside a waveguide with different orientations ,",
