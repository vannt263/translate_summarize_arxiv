    "observational studies of the circumstellar environment ( cse ) of evolved stars mainly concentrate on infrared emission from dust ( peaking around 60 @xmath0 m ) and radio line emission of various molecular species ( e.g. co , hcn , cn ) .",
    "both tracers are very powerful in studying a large sample of stars , and the overall characteristics of the cse , but , since they are in emission they lack positional information about the line forming region .",
    "other tracers of the cse are infrared emission features ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , pah ; unidentified infrared bands , uir ; circumstellar reddening ) . the physics of these latter tracers are not well understood and with our current knowledge it is not possible to extract detailed physical information from these tracers .",
    "a different category of tracer is molecular spectra .",
    "absorption spectra only probe a well defined pencil beam toward the continuum source , and are very well suited for detailed studies of the cse .",
    "emission spectra are rare and their occurrence is almost always connected with some kind of violent mechanism ( e.g. shocks ) .",
    "fortunately , the molecules for which circumstellar spectra have been detected are rather simple with at most three atoms ( table 1 ) .",
    "the physics of these molecules is sufficiently well understood that they can be used to extract physical information about the line forming region ( sect .",
    "an additional advantage of these molecules is that their electronic spectra fall in the ultraviolet and optical part of the spectrum and acquiring these spectra is relatively easy .    in this paper",
    "we discuss circumstellar molecular spectra with a strong emphasis on absorption line studies .",
    "we will ask ourself four question : where are they , why bother , which species , and what can we learn ?      in the broadest sense we could argue that circumstellar absorption spectra are expected to be present in all cases where there is circumstellar matter between the observer and the continuum source .",
    "the continuum source is mostly the star .",
    "we therefore can expect molecular spectra towards rgb , agb , post - agb stars ( bakker et al . 1996/1997 , bakker & lambert , from now on paper i , ii , iii ) , supernovae ( dalgarno 1998 ) , young stellar object ( mitchell et al .",
    "1991 ) , and interacting binary systems . whether or not these absorption lines will be detected depends on the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum in combination with the column density of the observable species .",
    "this suggests that with the rise of larger telescopes and more sensitive detectors , we expect to find many more objects exhibiting circumstellar spectra .",
    "studies of radio line emission are faced with the problem that for a spatially unresolved source , the emission profile is the integrated emission of the cse .",
    "the intensity at a given frequency , does not correspond with one location in the shell , but with a ring of material for which the projected velocity in the radial direction corresponds to that frequency .",
    "if the shell is not spherically symmetric this problem is even more complicated .",
    "both these problems do not enter into absorption line studies : velocities are not projected and asymmetry is not important .",
    "only inhomogeneities along the line of sight could be important .      in order to give the final answer to this question",
    ", one has to know all allowed transitions of all molecules possibly present .",
    "this is beyond the scope of our work .",
    "instead we look at studies concerning interstellar , photospheric , and cometary molecules .",
    "absorption lines of molecules detected in interstellar diffuse clouds are among others : h@xmath1 , hd , ch , ch@xmath2 , c@xmath1 , oh , co , nh , cn , cs(mm ) , and hcl ( van dishoeck 1997 ) .",
    "molecules detected in the photosphere of cool stars are among others : c@xmath1 , cn , ch , hcn , and c@xmath1h@xmath1 ( jrgensen 1997 ) .",
    "molecules detected in cometary spectra are among others : co , c@xmath1 , cs , nh@xmath3 and many highly reactive species ( weaver 1997 , bockelee - morvan 1997 ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to compute chemical models of the cse ( cherchneff et al .",
    "1993 ) and predict column densities .    the question now arises which of these molecules are likely to be present at high enough abundance to be detectable .",
    "cometary lines are due to evaporation and successive photo - dissociation .",
    "this time scale is much shorter than the corresponding time scale in circumstellar shells and cometary molecules ( especially the reactive ones ) might not be abundant in circumstellar shells .",
    "photospheric molecules exist at a much higher temperature than circumstellar molecules .",
    "the chemical equilibrium is different in the two environments and therefore different molecules might be present .",
    "interstellar molecules experience roughly the same conditions ( density , temperature , and interstellar radiation field ) as circumstellar molecules . in order of probability of the presence of circumstellar molecules ( with absorption spectra )",
    "we propose interstellar , followed by photospheric and cometary species .",
    "as we will demonstrated in this paper , circumstellar absorption spectra of ch@xmath2 , c@xmath1 , cn , co , c@xmath3 , sic@xmath1 and emission of ch@xmath2 , c@xmath1 , co , c@xmath3 , alo , vo , and zro have been detected ( table 1 ) .",
    "there remains a large amount of work to be done to check for the presence of the other molecules .",
    "in particular the detection ( at high - resolution , @xmath4 ) of circumstellar absorption of h@xmath1 and co is of fundamental importance .",
    "_ identification : _ a symmetric molecule like c@xmath1 does not have transitions in the radio .",
    "electronic bands allow to study these molecule .",
    "the interstellar abundance of ch@xmath2 is still not well understood , studying circumstellar ch@xmath2 spectra might help to improve our understanding of the formation process .",
    "the presence of the unidentified 21 @xmath0 m feature is strongly correlated with the presence of c@xmath1 and cn absorption , which suggests that the 21 @xmath0 m feature is due to a carbon bearing molecule .",
    "very accurate expansion velocities can be determined .",
    "the correlation of expansion velocity with the photospheric abundance pattern ( mainly carbon abundance ) might give information about the mass - loss mechanism .",
    "different molecules probe different layers .",
    "the expansion velocity can be determined throughout the shell and possibly a slow change of expansion velocity can be detected as a result of the star s evolution .",
    "the temperature and chemical content of the shell can be studied as a function of radius .",
    "this is important for radio emission lines since in the radio only few levels of a molecule are probed and the total number of molecules is obtained by extrapolating to higher levels given a certain lte temperature .",
    "we found that c@xmath1 is pumped by the stellar radiation field ( supra - thermal ) , while cn is sub - thermal ( paper i , ii ) .",
    "nucleo - synthesis of agb stars and the third dredge - up .",
    "1 shows our first detection of @xmath5cn violet system ( 0,0 ) in hd56126 ( paper iii ) .",
    "we found @xmath6cn/@xmath5cn=23@xmath71 and that this ratio is affected by the isotopic exchange reaction and puts only a lower limit on the @xmath6c/@xmath5c ratio .",
    "a possible change with time might be detected of the molecular bands due to inhomogeneities in the line of sight .",
    "some of the stars pulsate .",
    "a time delay between the pulsation of the star and the change in temperature of the molecule , would yield the radius at which that molecule is present .",
