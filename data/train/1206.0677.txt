    "the identification and control of nonlinear system have been widely studied in recent years @xcite . before the design of a controller , it is necessary to achieve system identification . in general",
    ", the process of system identification can be decomposed into two steps : the selection of an appropriate identification model ( system structure ) and an estimation of the model s parameters , of which , the parameter estimation plays a relatively more important role since a specific class of models that can best describe the real system can usually be derived by mechanism analysis of industrial processes @xcite .",
    "+ as for techniques of parameter estimation , approaches such as least - squares method , instrumental variable method , correlative function method , and maximum - likelihood method are widely used @xcite . especially for the least - squares method , it has been successfully utilized to identify the parameters in static and dynamic systems @xcite .",
    "however , most of these techniques have some fundamental issues , including their dependence on unrealistic assumptions such as unimodal performance and differentiability of the performance function , and they are easily getting trapped into local optimum , because these methods are in essence local search techniques based on gradient . for example , the least - squares method is only suitable for the model structure possessing some linear property .",
    "once the model structure exhibits nonlinear performance , this approach often fails in finding a global optimum and becomes ineffective @xcite .",
    "+ fortunately , the modern intelligent optimization algorithms , such as genetic algorithm ( ga ) @xcite , particle swarm optimization ( pso ) @xcite , are global search techniques based not on gradient , and they have been successfully applied in various optimization problems even with multimodal property . as a matter of fact , some intelligent optimization algorithms have been utilized in the field of nonlinear system identification and control . in @xcite , estimation of bar parameters with binary - coded genetic algorithm was studied , and it was verified that the gas can produce better results than most deterministic methods . genetic algorithm based parameter identification of a hysteretic brushless exciter model",
    "was proposed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "real - coded genetic algorithms were applied for nonlinear system identification and controller tuning , and the simulation examples demonstrated the effectiveness of the ga based approaches .",
    "then , in @xcite , parameter estimation and control of nonlinear system based on adaptive particle swarm optimization were presented , and examples confirmed the validity of the method . further more , in @xcite , identification of jiles - atherton model parameters using particle swarm optimization , and in @xcite , parameters identification for pem fuel - cell mechanism model based on effective informed adaptive particle swarm optimization were put forwarded subsequently .",
    "all of these indicate that intelligent optimization techniques are alternatives for traditional methods including gradient descent , quasi - newton , and nelde - mead s simplex methods .",
    "+ although ga and pso are alternative approaches for the problem , they always encounter premature convergence and their convergence rates are not so satisfactory when dealing with some complex or multimodal functions@xcite .",
    "state transition algorithm ( sta ) is a novel optimization method based on the concept of state and state transition recently , which originates from the thought of state space representation and space transformation @xcite . in sta , four special transformation operators are designed , and they represent different search functions in space , which makes sta easy to understand and convenient to implement . for continuous function optimization problems , sta has exhibited comparable search ability compared with other intelligent optimization algorithms @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , the sta is firstly introduced to identify the optimal parameters of nonlinear system .",
    "then , we will discuss the off - line pid controller design by adopting sta according to the estimated model .",
    "the pid control is popular due to its ease of use , good stability and simple realization .",
    "the key issue for pid controller design is the accurate and efficient tuning of pid control gains : proportional gain @xmath0 , integral gain @xmath1 and derivative gain @xmath2 . for adjusting pid controller parameters efficiently ,",
    "many methods were proposed .",
    "the ziegler - nichols method is an experimental one that is widely used ; however , this method needs certain prior knowledge on a plant model @xcite . once tuning the controller by ziegler - nichols method , a good but not optimum system response will be gained . on the other hand , many artificial intelligence techniques such as neural networks , fuzzy systems and neural - fuzzy logic have been widely applied to the appropriate tuning of pid controller gains @xcite . besides these methods , modern intelligent optimization algorithms , such as ga and pso , have also received much attention , and they are used to find the optimal parameters of pid controller @xcite .",
    "+ the goal of this paper is to introduce a novel method sta for both parameter estimation and control of nonlinear systems . in order to evaluate the performance of the sta",
    ", experiments are carried out to testify the validity of the proposed methodology , the results of which have confirmed that sta is an efficient method . compared with other intelligent optimization algorithms , the simulation examples have demonstrated that the sta has superior features in terms of search ability , convergence rate and stability .",
    "to transform a specified problem into the standard form of optimization problem is called optimization modeling , which is the basis for parameter identification and system control .",
    "the standard optimization problems should consist of objective function and decision variables , while optimization algorithms are used to find a global optimal solution to the objective function restricted to some additional constraints .      in this paper ,",
    "the following class of discrete nonlinear systems described by the state space model is considered : @xmath3 where , @xmath4 is the state vector , @xmath5 is the input , @xmath6 is the output , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are unknown parameter vectors that will be identified , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are nonlinear functions . without loss of generality , let @xmath11 $ ] be a rearranging vector containing all parameters in @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath12 represents the total number of unknown system parameters .",
    "furthermore , the estimated system model can be described as : @xmath13 where , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the state vector and the output of the model , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the estimated parameter vectors , respectively .",
    "accordingly , let @xmath18 $ ] be the estimated rearranging vector .",
    "+ the basic thought of system identification is to compare the real system responses with the estimated system responses .",
    "moreover , to accurately estimate the @xmath19 , some assumptions on the nonlinear systems are required : + ( 1 ) the system output must be available for measurement .",
    "+ ( 2 ) system parameters must be connected with the system output .",
    "+ to deal with the problem of parameter estimation , a specified problem should be formulated as an optimization problem . in this study , the decision variables are the estimated parameter vector @xmath19 , while the objective function is chosen as the following mean squared errors(mse ) : @xmath20 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where , @xmath21 is the length of sampling data , @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] are real and estimated values at time @xmath24 , respectively . + it is obvious to find that the mse is the function of variable vector @xmath19 , and then , the optimization problem will be solved by optimization algorithms which will minimize the mse value so that the real nonlinear system is actually estimated .",
    "the block diagram of the nonlinear system parameter estimation is given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "when the nonlinear system model is estimated , an off - line pid controller is then designed to guarantee the stability and other performances of the system .",
    "the reason why the pid controller is adopted is that it is the most widely used controller for application in industrial processes .",
    "the continuous form of a pid controller can be described as follows : @xmath25,\\ ] ] where , @xmath26 is the error signal between the desired and actual outputs , @xmath27 is the control force , @xmath28 are the proportional gain , integral time constant and derivative time constant , respectively . by using the following approximations : @xmath29 where , @xmath30 is the sampling period , then ( 5 ) can be rewritten as @xmath31\\},\\ ] ] which is called the place type , and in most case , the increment style as described following is more practical :    @xmath32+\\frac{t}{t_i}e(k)+\\frac{t_d}{t}[e(k)-2e(k-1)+e(k-2)]\\}\\\\       & = u(k-1)+ k_p[e(k)-e(k-1 ) ] + k_ie(k)+ k_d[e(k)-2e(k-1)+e(k-2 ) ] , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are integral gain and derivative gain , respectively .",
    "+        [ ] the block diagram of the design of an off - line pid controller is illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] , where @xmath33 is the reference output , and @xmath34 is the system output at the sampling point .",
    "optimization algorithms are used to adjust the pid controller parameters such as @xmath35 and @xmath2 . in the same way ,",
    "mean squared errors will be defined as the objective function @xmath36 ^ 2.\\ ] ]",
    "let s consider the following unconstrained optimization problem : @xmath37 where , @xmath38 is a objective function . in a numerical way",
    ", the iterative method is adopted to solve the problem , the essence of which is to update the solution found so far .",
    "when thinking in a state and state transition way , a solution can be regarded as a state , and the updating of a solution can be considered as a state transition process .",
    "+ based on the thought stated above , the form of state transition algorithm can be described as follows , @xmath39 where , @xmath40 stands for a state , corresponding to a solution of a optimization problem ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are state transition matrices , which are usually transformation operators ; @xmath43 is the function of variable @xmath40 and historical states ; @xmath44 is the objective function or evaluation function .",
    "+ using various types of space transformation for reference , four special state transformation operators are designed to solve continuous function optimization problems .",
    "+ ( 1 ) rotation transformation @xmath45 where , @xmath40 @xmath46 @xmath47 , @xmath48 is a positive constant , called rotation factor ; @xmath49 @xmath46 @xmath50 is a random matrix with its elements belonging to the range of [ -1 , 1 ] and @xmath51 is 2-norm of a vector .",
    "it has proved that the rotation transformation has the function of searching in a hypersphere @xcite . + ( 2 )",
    "translation transformation + @xmath52",
    "where , @xmath53 is a positive constant , called translation factor ; @xmath54 @xmath55 is a random variable with its elements belonging to the range of [ 0,1 ] .",

    "+ when using these transformation operators into practice , an important parameter called search enforcement(se ) is introduced to describe the times of certain transformation .",
    "+ the main procedures of the version of state transition algorithm in @xcite can be outlined in the following pseudocode .",

    "for both the identification of nonlinear system and the design of an off - line pid controller , when the optimization algorithms are utilized , they help to minimize the mean squared errors ( mse ) . in other words ,",
    "the mse or the evaluation of the objective function will guide the search of the algorithms .",
