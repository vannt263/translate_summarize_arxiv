    "it is today widely accepted , that a super massive black hole ( smbh ) resides in the very centre of most bright galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "phenomenology of active galactic nuclei ( hereafter agn ) can be explained by accretion of material onto the smbh , with the subsequent emission of radiation , by the unified model ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "this model explained successfully the occurrence of broad emission lines in polarised light in the spectra of some seyfert 2 galaxies ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; miller & goodrich 1990 ) , as well as the existence of high - excitation gas extending out from the nucleus with conical and biconical morphology ( e.g.  wilson et al .",
    "1988 ; tadhunter & tsvetanov 1989 ; prez et al .",
    "1989 ) . one point that remained controversial for a decade is the nature of the blue and ultraviolet continuum found in many seyfert 2 ( sy2 ) spectra .",
    "this was first attributed to scattered light from the hidden seyfert 1 ( sy1 ) nucleus .",
    "however , tran ( 1995 ) showed that this can not be the general case , as the polarisation of the continuum was frequently much lower than that of the broad lines , which can not be explained by the scattering scenario .",
    "terlevich ( 1990 ) proposed a stellar origin for this continuum , and cid fernandes & terlevich ( 1995 ) proposed that a reddened starburst provides this emission .    the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has provided a deep insight into the nature of uv light in seyferts , due to the very high resolution provided , and a relatively high uv sensitivity .",
    "high resolution imaging of sy2 galaxies pointed to a stellar origin for this light in several cases ( heckman et al .",
    "1997 ; colina et al .  1997 ; gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "powerful circumnuclear starbursts have been unambiguously identified in 40 per cent of nearby sy 2 galaxies ( gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "2001 ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "these starbursts were originally detected by means of either uv or optical spectroscopy of the central few 100 pc .",
    "several spectroscopic works have detected features of young and intermediate age stellar population ( heckman et al .",
    "1997 ; gonzlez delgado et al .  1998 , 2001 ; storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "2000 ) , suggesting that these populations are significant , if not dominant , in the nuclear region of many sy2 galaxies .    in order to understand better the nature of the near - uv light in sy galaxies , as well as the connection between the agn and starbursts processes",
    ", we carried out an hst snapshot survey of the nearest sy nuclei .",
    "the galaxies were imaged with the acs camera in its high resolution channel , through the filter f330w ( with an average wavelength of 336.72 nm ) . in this way we constructed a useful reference atlas of 75 sy galaxies which possess hst archival images of their nuclear region , in the near - uv , optical and near - ir , at a very high spatial resolution ( @xmath00.05 arcsec ) .",
    "the sample and the images of the objects , as well as a morphological and photometric analysis , were presented in muoz marn et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter mm07 ) . in that work we confirmed the presence of star formation in the circumnuclear region of a fraction of the galaxies ( @xmath060 per cent ) , and we found that circumnuclear star clusters can be found equally in both seyfert types .",
    "however we have also found extended emission , showing often a biconical structure , and/or bright filaments , which are unlikely to trace star - formation .",
    "to investigate the origin of this uv extended emission is the goal of this paper .",
    "there are several processes that are expected to contribute to the extended light in the f330w filter .",
    "the most relevant ones are :    * _ stellar continuum_. if compact knots are detected , they are probably young / intermediate age massive star clusters , or clumps of them .",
    "but the extended uv emission could also be due to an unresolved population of smaller star - clusters , or generated by the disruption of ageing star clusters ( tremonti et al .  2001 ;",
    "chandar et al .  2005 ) , as well as emission from the underlying older stellar population of the galaxy .",
    "* _ nebular continuum_. radiation from free - free and free - bound electron transitions , as well as two photon decay of level 2@xmath1 of hi , can be an important contribution in regions with ionised gas , and it is expected to be extended , as much of the ionised gas is . *",
    "_ emission lines from ionised gas .",
    "_ in the wavelength range covered by the f330w filter at the redshift range of the galaxies only two emission lines contribute significantly , [ nev]@xmath23346,3426 .",
    "* _ light from the agn _ can be scattered by free electrons or dust and contribute with extended emission .    in this work",
    "we aim to disentangle the contribution of the different processes that may contribute to the extended near - uv emission . with this purpose , we focus our analysis on a subsample of seyfert galaxies in which the dominant morphology at near - uv wavelengths is extended emission that is not obviously associated to compact starbursts or star clusters , and for which both near - uv acs data and wfpc2 [ oiii ] images exist .",
    "the sample and data are presented in section [ sec : samp ] . in sections",
    "[ sec : nev ] , [ sec : nc ] and [ sec : scat ] , we give an estimation of the expected contribution of each possible component to the extended uv light emission , whereas in section [ sec : uv - oiii ] we create synthetic [ nev ] and nebular continuum images from a direct scaling of the [ oiii ] images . in section [ sec : phot ] we explain the photometric analysis performed to study the remaining light after the subtraction of the modeled ionised gas component .",
    "a detailed discussion for each object is presented in .",
    "a general discussion and summary is presented in ; and our conclusions can be found in .",
    "our sample comprises the galaxies of our seyfert atlas ( mm07 ) with extended emission , that are also studied by schmitt et al .",
    "the latter work presents hst [ oiii ] images of the nuclear region of 60 nearby seyfert galaxies , the largest [ oiii ] imaging compilation of the narrow line region ( nlr ) of nearby sy s , which are imaged at a resolution comparable to ours .",
    "we end up with a final sample of 15 galaxies , from which 8 are sy2 and 7 are sy1 . for the sake of simplicity we have included the 4 sy1.5 and the one sy1.8 ( ugc12138 ) in the sy1 group , as they all have in common a very bright nuclear source that dominates the inner emission at near - uv wavelengths ( mm07 ) .",
    "the objects , together with some basic properties , are listed in table [ tab : oiii_sample ] .",
    "there is no significant difference between sy1 and sy2 subsamples , neither with respect to their mean distance ( 71  mpc for sy1 , and 74  mpc for sy2 ) , nor with their mean axial ratio ( b / a of 0.80 for sy1 , while it is 0.74 for sy2 ) .",
    "this does not change when considering median values .",
    "the f330w acs images were reduced by the hst pipeline following the standard procedure of bias subtraction , flat - calibration and distortion correction .",
    "then , the exposures were cleaned from cosmic rays by hand .",
    "the [ oiii ] images were obtained with the wfpc2 , with the chip wfc in most cases , and with the pc for some objects ; ngc3393 , was imaged with the wfpc before costar , and had to be deconvolved .",
    "the majority of [ oiii ] images were taken with the linear ramp filter , whose flat - fielding is not performed by the hst pipeline , and requires a bit of extra work . for details on the reduction process of these data , see schmitt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the wfpc2 images , and schmitt & kinney ( 1996 ) for ngc3393 data .",
    "in addition to the near - uv band , we downloaded and reduced wfpc2 images of the galaxies trough the filter f547 m .",
    "the use of these images has the advantage of minimising the contamination by strong emission lines , and that all the objects , except for ngc7212 and ugc1214 , are imaged in this band ( as it served in most cases for the continuum subtraction of the [ oiii ] image ) , what allows for a comparison between them .",
    "the images were used for the photometric analysis of section [ sec : phot ] .",
    "these images were reduced with the standard procedure using the hst pipeline . when more than one image were available , single exposures were combined and cleaned from cosmic rays with iraf task ` crrej ' .",
    "remaining cosmic rays were eliminated by hand . finally , the images were resampled to the acs scale .",
    "we completed the photometric set with nicmos f160w images .",
    "this last filter has the advantage that there are data for all but one ( ngc7212 ) of the objects , and that it is so wide that we can neglect the contribution from emission lines .",
    "nicmos single exposures were corrected for the ` pedestal effect ' ( produced by changes in the bias levels of the different chips during the exposure ) with iraf task ` pedsub ' , combined with the standard calibration pipeline , and resampled to acs resolution .",
    "fig.1 shows a comparison between the near - uv acs images and the narrow - band continuum subtracted [ oiii]@xmath35007 images .",
    "this comparison shows a very similar morphology in most cases . in some cases , especially in those of clear bi - conical structure ,",
    "the morphology is identical to that of the [ oiii ] ( ic5063 , ngc3393 , and ugc1214 ) , implying that the near - uv emission is produced in the same region that the ionised gas , and thus nebular continuum and [ nev ] emission will be the main contributors to the uv light emission . in the case of",
    "ngc3516 the morphology is very dissimilar , with an extended uv emission surrounding the bright nucleus that does not match the bi - conical structure in [ oiii ] .",
    "this means that in this case we may be observing mostly light which seems not to be associated to the ionised gas emission . also in ngc5347",
    "this kind of emission is likely responsible for the conical region extending to the north at less than 1  arcsec from the central source .",
    "there are also a few cases in which , in addition to the extended emission , the uv light comes from knots or clumps produced probably by star clusters . ngc4253 and ngc7212 are two examples of this .",

    "the near - ultraviolet morphology of the 15 objects studied in this work has been described in muoz marn et al .",
    "this work is complementary to it , as we intend to gain insight into the light emitting processes that generate the particular morphology of each object . in the nuclei of seyfert type 1 to 1.5",
    ", the dominant component is the agn emission , visible as a bright point - like source . in these objects",
    "the nucleus has to be removed prior to any further analysis .    in order to understand the diffuse light emission we start by focussing on the ionised gas emission .",
    "we have used the narrow band [ oiii ] images from schmitt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to remove this component .",
    "the [ oiii ] images were scaled in order to model and subtract the predicted contribution from the [ nev ] lines and nebular continuum from the f330w image .",
    "an estimation of a reasonable range of scaling factors was presented in section  [ sec : nc ] .",
    "a comparison of the narrow band images ( tracing the ionised gas ) , with the near - uv broad band images , show a strong similarity in many cases .",
    "we have demonstrated , by scaling accordingly the [ oiii ] images , that the emission of the ionised gas can explain the extended emission visible in several objects .",
    "this is the case of the filamentary structure in ic5063 , ngc3393 or ugc1214 ( mrk573 ) , as well as parts of the more diffuse emission in mrk6 , mrk915 , ngc5347 and ngc7212 . these regions of ionised gas are large , extending from 100pc to 1kpc from the nucleus , and in general can be accounted for with a scaling factor for the [ oiii ] image ( in the range f@xmath00.20.4 ) , consistent with the expected level of line emission and nebular continuum contamination .",
    "when possible , we have performed a photometric study in three bands : near - uv ( acs f330w ) , optical ( wfpc2 f547 m ) , and near - ir ( nicmos f160w ) .",
    "the results are summarised in a colour - colour diagram , in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] .",
    "we have measured colours around f160w  f547m@xmath0 - 1 and f547m  f330w@xmath00.81.8 , in stmag , for several objects .",
    "these colours are consistent with a several ga old stellar population .",
    "we interpret this as an indication that the diffuse emission remaining after estimating and subtracting the ionised gas contribution , can be attributed to the underlying stellar population of the bulge .",
    "this is the case of objects such as ic5063 , ngc1320 , ngc3516 , ugc1214 , ugc6100 , and ugc12138 .    in a number of objects we also find a strong near - uv emission extending less than 100pc from the nucleus ( see for example ngc4593 )",
    ". these are mostly sy1 in which even after the best nuclear - psf subtraction , there remains a compact but resolved emission .",
    "we have already argued that we do not think this is an artifact of the psf subtraction of the nucleus , but a real feature .",
    "however , it is true that the nuclear subtraction generates uncertainties that preclude any accurate analysis of the very inner region . in these cases",
    ", we can not say much about the origin of this light .",
    "we have made some calculations to set an upper limit to the contribution of the ionised gas emission , as indication for a different mechanism .",
    "a strong change in the ionisation parameter ( higher towards the centre ) has not been ruled out , though .",
    "the physical regions studied in this work are located between 100pc and 1kpc from the seyfert nuclei . at these scales ,",
    "the scattered light from the agn does not seem to contribute in a significant fraction to the total light , in the majority of the cases .",
    "we demonstrated that , in general , an ionised gas contribution is very difficult to distinguish from a young stellar population with a photometric analysis and the filters used .",
    "however , we suspect that in the case of ngc7674 , the scattered light from the agn is responsible for the near - uv emission to the northwest of the nucleus .",
    "this is the only evidence for scattered agn light that we find among the objects studied , although absence of evidence is different from evidence of absence , and scattered light could play an important role in other objects with an unidentified blue component , as for example ngc7212 .",
    "this result differs from those in radio galaxies studies .",
    "for example , tadhunter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that the objects with largest uv polarisation tend to have the largest emission line luminosities . in cygnus",
    "a , ogle et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , find reflection nebulae in polarised light that have a similar scale and general morphology to the ionisation cone seen in emission lines .",
    "there is a possible way out of this .",
    "dust is expected to correlate with the gas distribution , and therefore some scattered emission might have been subtracted with the ionised gas .",
    "that would explain high values of the scaling factor for the [ oiii ] image , as in the case of ngc1320 , and at least in part , the positive residuals of some of the objects .",
    "however , as discussed above , ionised gas emission alone can explain the cases in which the near - uv morphology matches the [ oiii ] emission .    regarding a possible starburst component , we have not found , in general , unequivocal evidence of extended unresolved young stellar populations .",
    "however there are several objects , such as ic5063 , ngc1320 , ngc3393 , ngc5347 , and ugc1214 , which show spectroscopic evidence for young or intermediate age stellar population ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "2001 ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2004 ; gonzlez delgado & prez 1996b ) but do not show obvious star clusters in the near - uv images",
    ". that would be the case of a population of small star clusters appearing unresolved in our images , or a very high rate of cluster disruption in the nuclear region .",
    "star - forming regions and massive star clusters stand out as compact knots in the near - uv image .",
    "they make a significant contribution in a fraction of objects ( 4/15 , or @xmath027 per cent ) ; namely , ngc4253 , ngc5548 , ngc7212 , and ngc7674 .",
    "in addition there are 2 objects ( ngc4593 and ugc6100 ) in which star clusters are identified but lay at kpc distance from the centre of the galaxy , far away of the region studied and thus they do not contribute to the near - uv emission in the nuclear region .",
    "this is why we leave out these two objects in the general conclusions .",
    "therefore @xmath040 per cent of the sample ( 6/15 objects , including the two objects with clusters further than 1kpc ) show circumnuclear star clusters , while in the original sample we find star clusters in around 70 per cent of the sample .",
    "this difference can be attributed to a bias due to the fact that the sample analysed here is only a small subsample of the larger sample , selected on the basis of availability of [ oiii ] data .",
    "there exists the possibility that a young stellar population is completely diluted in the bulge light and we can not detect it . emission from the ionised gas , as well as the underlying bulge stellar population",
    "are enough to explain the diffuse light in most cases . on the contrary , the clumps and compact emission are likely due to star - formation or agn light .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : res ] show no apparent trend between the seyfert type and the magnitudes calculated , such as estimated scaling factor for the [ oiii ] image , the ionised gas contribution to the total near - uv light , or the flux in the inner kpc",
    ". however , we have to take into account the small size of the sample and the difficulties to study some sy1 for which we could set only upper limits to the ionised gas contribution .",
    "our main conclusions are : + - for @xmath050 per cent of the galaxies of the sample ( 8/15 ) , emission of ionised gas from the nlr dominates the near - uv extended emission reaching up to 1kpc from the nucleus . + - for 7 galaxies , we could obtain broad - band photometry of the uv images after the subtraction of the ionised gas emission ; for 6 of them , colours of the extended emission left after the subtraction of the gas emission are consistent with those of an old stellar population ; among these galaxies there are also 5 objects for which we find evidence of an additional contribution of either scattered nuclear light or a diffuse young stellar population . + - only for 1 galaxy we have found that scattered light dominates the extended emission , although this kind of emission might be present at a lower level in a large fraction of the objects .",
    "+ - for 4/15 galaxies of the sample , star forming regions appear as compact knots surrounding the nucleus and contribute significantly to the near - uv light in the inner kpc .    in summary",
    ", there is not a unique and dominating mechanism responsible for the near - uv emission .",
    "each object deserves a particular study and a close inspection , as we find the most varied morphologies .",
    "a deeper study would require the use of spectroscopy , and optimally , the use of ifu data with enough resolution and polarisation observations .    , but adding the photometric results for several objects .",

    "<S> we study the nature of the extended near - uv emission in the inner kiloparsec of a sample of 15 seyfert galaxies which have both near - uv ( f330w ) and narrow band [ oiii ] high resolution hubble images . for the majority of the objects we find a very similar morphology in both bands . from the [ oiii ] </S>",
    "<S> images we construct synthetic images of the nebular continuum plus the emission line contribution expected through the f330w filter , which can be subtracted from the f330w images . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the emission of the ionised gas dominates the near - uv extended emission in half of the objects </S>",
    "<S> . a further broad band photometric study , in the bands f330w ( _ u _ ) , f547 m ( _ v _ ) and f160w ( _ h _ ) , shows that the remaining emission is dominated by the underlying galactic bulge contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a blue component whose nature is not clear in 4 out of 15 objects . </S>",
    "<S> this component may be attributed to scattered light from the agn , to a young stellar population in unresolved star clusters , or to early - disrupted clusters . </S>",
    "<S> star forming regions and/or bright off - nuclear star clusters are observed in 4/15 galaxies of the sample .    </S>",
