    "establishing the properties of the chiral phase transition in qcd is one of the outstanding problems in lattice simulations of qcd thermodynamics .",
    "although several attempts have been undertaken to establish the unique scaling behavior in the limit of vanishing light quark masses no clear - cut evidence for the expected @xmath4 scaling , related to the underlying chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian , has been found .",
    "this may have several reasons related to common problems in lattice calculations : cut - off effects , finite volume effects , explicit flavor symmetry breaking and/or too large quark masses .",
    "we will discuss here yet another effect that influences the scaling behavior of thermodynamic quantities in the vicinity of the finite temperature chiral transition of qcd and may compete with the universal scaling in the vicinity of @xmath2 .",
    "this is related to singularities in chiral observables , e.g. the chiral susceptibility , that are induced at any temperature in the chiral symmetry broken phase .",
    "the existence of these singularities induced by fluctuations of goldstone modes are well known from the analysis of 3 and 4 dimensional statistical models and field theories with global @xmath5 ) symmetries that are spontaneously broken at low temperature @xcite .",
    "at vanishing temperature properties of qcd in the light quark sector are described by an effective 4-d , @xmath7 symmetric lagrangian ; chiral symmetry is broken and , what is of interest here , at non - zero quark mass the light quark chiral condensate , @xmath8 , receives logarithmic corrections proportional to @xmath9 that are due to the presence of light goldstone modes @xcite .",
    "this leads to a logarithmic divergence of the chiral susceptibility , @xmath10 . in three dimensions the analog to these logarithmic terms",
    "are corrections that are proportional to the square root of the quark mass @xcite . as a consequence @xmath11 will diverge in the chiral limit like @xmath12 .    in the vicinity of the qcd phase transition a 3-d ,",
    "@xmath7 symmetric effective theory is expected to describe the universal properties of the transition @xcite which will also control the properties of the chiral condensate for temperatures close to @xmath2 . we thus expect that in the chiral limit @xmath11 will diverge for all values of the temperature @xmath13 , @xmath14 m_l^{1/\\delta -1 } & , \\ ;",
    "t = t_c \\end{cases } \\label{scaling}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 for 3-d @xmath7 as well as @xmath16 symmetric spin models .",
    "the appearance of a square root singularity has , in fact , been established in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition of an @xmath17 gauge theory coupled to adjoint fermions @xcite where it is apparent already for moderately small values of the quark mass .",
    "similar evidence for the role of light goldstone modes in qcd , however , has been missing so far .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp ] we show the light quark chiral condensate , @xmath8 calculated in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd with improved staggered fermions ( p4-action ) on lattices of size @xmath18 for various values of the gauge coupling .",
    "the figures show results for @xmath8 , plotted versus the light quark mass ( @xmath1 ) expressed in units of the strange quark mass ( @xmath19 ) ( left ) and the square root of this ratio ( right ) .",
    "the right hand figure indeed suggests that the strong curvature of @xmath8 as function of @xmath1 is well accounted for by a @xmath20 dependence for @xmath0 . in any case , the weaker than linear dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath1 leads to a strong quark mass dependence of the chiral susceptibility , @xmath11 .",
    "this susceptibility receives two contributions , usually referred to as disconnected and connected parts , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 here @xmath23 denotes the staggered fermion matrix for light quarks . in general , both contributions are sensitive to the goldstone modes and will receive divergent contributions , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we will restrict our analysis here to the disconnected part .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] we show @xmath25 calculated for various values of @xmath1 . in these calculations the strange quark mass is close to its physical value and @xmath1 reaches values well below the physical one ; a ratio @xmath26 corresponds in the continuum limit to the physical quark mass ratio .",
    "the strong quark mass dependence in a wide temperature interval is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : chi](left ) ; its dominant contribution in the low temperature regime is indeed well described by @xmath12 as can be seen from the rescaled data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi](right ) .",
    "we note that this seems to hold for all quark masses , @xmath27 , although at present our data sample for the lightest quark mass is not yet good enough to substantiate this statement also for this light mass value , which corresponds to a light pseudo - scalar mass of about @xmath28  mev .",
    "we furthermore , note that the square root behavior also dominates the quark mass dependence in the peak region , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no evidence for a stronger singularity , which is expected to arise from the singular part of the partition function of 3-d , o(4 ) ( or o(2 ) ) symmetric models , @xmath29 .",
    "the general features of the quark mass dependence of the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility are also apparent in calculations currently performed by the hotqcd collaboration on lattice with temporal extent @xmath30 @xcite , _ i.e. _ closer to the continuum limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi8 ] we show @xmath25 and the rescaled susceptibility .",
    "the left hand part of the figure shows that for temperatures above the transition region the susceptibilities quickly become quark mass independent .",
    "this is expected as the chiral condensates will be linear in the quark mass in the chirally symmetric phase of qcd .",
    "below the transition region we again observe a strong quark mass dependence that is consistent with @xmath31 .",
    "the weak quark mass dependence of @xmath11 in the high temperature regime suggest that the susceptibility can already be described by the limiting form for the @xmath32 limit , @xmath33 a \\left(\\frac{t - t_c}{t_c}\\right)^{-\\gamma } & , \\ ; t > t_c \\end{cases } \\label{chiral}\\ ] ] a consistent picture for the chiral susceptibility thus seems to emerge despite the missing evidence for @xmath4 scaling for its peak height .",
