    "the addition of current considerations to water wave systems introduces various degrees of complexity depending on the current profile under study . understanding the interaction of waves and currents provides applications for the prediction of tsunami , rogue waves , etc . and is of interest to oceanographers and climatologists amongst many interested groups .    for a general description of the problem of waves and currents",
    "we refer to the following reviews and monographs @xcite and the references therein .    for ocean waves of large magnitude",
    ", the viscosity does not play an essential role and can be neglected , so effectively the fluid dynamics are given by euler s equations . in 1968 v.e .",
    "zakharov in his work @xcite demonstrated that irrotational waves on deep water have a canonical hamiltonian formulation ( i.e. zero vorticity and one layer ) .",
    "the result has been extended to models with finite depth and shear with constant vorticity @xcite .",
    "the study of such essentially non - linear waves and their interaction with currents is of utmost importance in the advancement of geophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "most predictions of water - wave propagation in oceanography use linear approximations .",
    "although this approach is successful in many instances , for complex flow patterns an adequate description of the phenomenon can not neglect nonlinear effects .",
    "for this reason we aim to develop a nonlinear approach that captures the main features of the dynamics and is also amenable to approximations ( linear or weakly nonlinear ) in specific physical regimes , thus enabling an in - depth study in these circumstances .",
    "several irrotational @xcite and rotational models @xcite and in particular the model of 2-media systems with internal waves such as @xcite form the framework for the study being undertaken .",
    "the consideration of wave - current interactions has been explored in several recent studies @xcite .",
    "this paper considers a two - media system where the media are separated by an internal wave .",
    "the bottom of the system is bounded by an impermeable flat - bed .",
    "the top of the system is also considered to be a flat surface .",
    "it is important to note that , by comparison to @xcite , this is not equivalent to assuming the amplitude of the surface waves as being small .",
    "one has to keep in mind that no matter how small the surface waves are there is a coupling between surface and internal waves .    in geophysical models , for example in the equatorial region , the pacific",
    "is characterised by a thin shallow layer of warm and less dense water over a much deeper layer of cold denser water .",
    "the two layers are separated by a sharp thermocline ( where the temperature gradient has a maximum , it is very close to the pycnocline , where the pressure gradient has a maximum ) at a depth , depending on the location , but usually at 100200 m beneath the surface .",
    "both layers are homogeneous and their sharp boundary is the thermocline / pycnocline .",
    "internal waves are formed at this boundary .",
    "this paper aims to generalise the studies of internal waves by considering different vorticities and current profiles in each medium .",
    "recovery of already known special cases will be demonstrated .",
    "a two - dimensional water wave system consisting of two discrete fluid domains separated by a free common interface in the form of an internal wave , such as a pycnocline or thermocline , is studied as per figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "describes the elevation of the internal wave.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the system is bounded at the bottom by an impermeable flatbed and is considered as being bounded on the surface by an assumption of absence of surface motion .",
    "the domains @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined with values associated with each domain using corresponding respective subscript notation . also , subscript @xmath7 ( implying _ common interface _ ) will be used to denote evaluation on the internal wave .",
    "propagation of the internal wave is assumed to be in the positive @xmath8-direction which is considered to be eastward. the centre of gravity is in the negative @xmath9-direction .",
    "the function @xmath10 describes the elevation of the internal wave with the mean of @xmath11 assumed to be zero , @xmath12    the system is considered incompressible with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the respective constant densities of the lower and upper media and stability is given by the immiscibility condition @xmath15    the velocity fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the lower and upper media respectively are defined in terms of the respective velocity potentials @xmath18 and stream functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the constant non - zero vorticities .",
    "the motivation for the decomposition is the separation of the velocity potential to `` wave - motion '' components , given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the @xmath26 and @xmath27 terms , generating constant horizontal velocity components of the flows in the corresponding domains .",
    "we make the assumption that the functions @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 belong to the schwartz class @xmath31 with respect to the @xmath8 variable ( for any @xmath9 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "this reflects the localised nature of the wave disturbances .",
    "the assumption of course implies that for large absolute values of @xmath8 the internal wave attenuates @xmath33    effectively the current profiles in @xmath34 and @xmath35 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , correspondingly . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are constants , representing the average flow in each respective domain , see @xcite , where the situation with a free surface is studied .    considering equatorial motion ( equatorial current and undercurrent coupled to internal waves ) the following coriolis forces per unit mass have to be taken into account : @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the rotational speed of earth .",
    "+ interface velocity potentials @xmath42 and @xmath43 are introduced defined as @xmath44 the variable @xmath45 introduced in @xcite , will play the important role of momentum .",
    "it is defined as @xmath46    and belongs to @xmath31 . since @xmath47 and @xmath48 , including on @xmath49 hence the hamiltonian structure ( the poisson brackets ) is the same as in @xcite , that is independent of the constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( although the hamiltonian , in general , depends on @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "the ( non - canonical ) equations of motion can be represented in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath50    where @xmath51 is the total energy of the system , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the stream function , evaluated at @xmath49 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the dynamics can be formally cast in the canonical form @xmath54    under the transformation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath55    which shows that the form @xmath56    is hamiltonian too @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath57 ensures that @xmath58 @xmath59 and hence @xmath60    the dynamics of the velocity potentials are given explicitly by euler s equations in terms of the velocity potentials : @xmath61 and @xmath62 for functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 which we consider as being arbitrary for the moment .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath10 is given by the kinematic boundary condition for the interface @xmath65 ( indicated by the subscript @xmath7 ) @xmath66 at the flat surface on the top @xmath67 is given by the atmospheric pressure @xmath68 and so @xmath69_{y = h_1}=f_1(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we choose @xmath70 therefore @xmath71_{y = h_1}=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at the interface @xmath65 we have @xmath72 and therefore @xmath73    we choose @xmath74 and so @xmath75 this gives the bernoulli condition    @xmath76    also , this gives @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the hydrostatic component and the remaining terms are due to the wave motion and @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the hydrostatic component and the remaining terms are due to the wave motion .",
    "the pressure in the body of the fluid can be evaluated from the functions @xmath81",
    "@xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 it will be demonstrated below that @xmath85 and @xmath83 at @xmath65 can be recovered from @xmath86 in addition , there is an interdependency between @xmath87 and @xmath88 since @xmath89 @xmath90 are analytic functions of the form @xmath91 thus , these analytic functions in their respective domains @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be recovered from their values at the corresponding boundary @xmath34 or @xmath92 i.e. from the values at @xmath93",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a constant hamiltonian density ( with zero variations ) , compensating for any constant terms that arise in the other integrals , so that the overall hamiltonian density is a function from the class @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath96 can be further decomposed , using ( [ def__stream_phi ] ) , as @xmath97 which can be written as @xmath98    where @xmath99 is another appropriate constant .",
    "we introduce the dirichlet - neumann operators @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the normal derivatives of the velocity potentials , at the interface , for outward normals @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( noting that @xmath105 ) , see more details in @xcite .    using the boundary conditions",
    "@xmath106 we get @xmath107 where @xmath108 recalling that @xmath109 then @xmath110 we define @xmath111 and so @xmath112 which means @xmath113    noting that @xmath114_x+ f(x , f_1(x))f'_1 ( x ) - f(x , f_2(x))f'_2(x)\\ ] ] and using we can write    @xmath115    and @xmath116    the terms ( [ eqtemp1 ] ) and ( [ eqtemp2 ] ) combine as @xmath117 also the integrals @xmath118 produce the terms @xmath119    noting that e.g. @xmath120 can be properly re - normalised as @xmath121dx\\ ] ]    by introducing a constant density integral @xmath122 having in mind that @xmath123 and that the constant densities are compensated by @xmath99 .",
    "the hamiltonian can hence be written as @xmath124 where    @xmath125    considering the case where @xmath126 and @xmath127 then @xmath128 and the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath129dx + \\frac{1}{2}g(\\rho-\\rho_1 ) \\int\\limits_{\\mathbb{r } } \\eta^2 dx\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] thus recovering the hamiltonian determined in @xcite .    in the case",
    "where @xmath130 and @xmath131 then @xmath132 and the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath133 which , by an application of the definition of @xmath134 from ( [ b_def ] ) , recovers the result in @xcite ( noting that there is a sign difference is the second and fourth terms due to the different stream function convention used in @xcite ) .",
    "in order to describe the scales , let us introduce non - dimensional variables ( without bars ) related to the dimensional ( barred ) as follows :    @xmath135    the constant @xmath136 represents the average amplitude of the waves @xmath10 under consideration and @xmath137 is a small parameter which will be used to separate the order of the terms in the model . from @xmath138",
    "it follows that @xmath139 therefore , if @xmath140 then @xmath141 and thus the dimensional expression with @xmath142 ( and similar for @xmath143 ) should be    @xmath144    since @xmath145 is a @xmath9-derivative of the velocity potential , and with the adopted definitions @xmath146 etc .",
    ", then    @xmath147    the other scales do not change - their dominant parts are the vorticity and current components of order 1 ; only the wave component ( which is the @xmath148derivative of @xmath149 ) is of order @xmath137 .",
    "the dirichlet - neumann operators have the following structure    @xmath150    where @xmath151 , i.e. @xmath152 , and similarly for @xmath153 , and so    @xmath154    where @xmath155 .",
    "the operator @xmath156 , which is a function of dirichlet - neumann operators , can hence be expressed as @xmath157    with this scaling , and ignoring the linear terms ( whose average is 0 ) , the hamiltonian can be expanded as @xmath158    recalling the dirichlet - neumann operators in ( [ dn_g ] ) and ( [ dn_g1 ] ) , noting that @xmath159^{(0)}\\eta_x=-\\eta d^2 [ b^{-1}]^{(0)}\\eta,\\ ] ] this gives @xmath160 where @xmath161 this gives the linear equations @xmath162 and @xmath163    looking for a solution which is a superposition of sine and cosine waves , we represent @xmath11 and @xmath164 as @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the wave number and @xmath167 is the angular frequency .",
    "the wave speed @xmath7 is given by @xmath168    introducing the functions @xmath169 one can obtain the following quadratic equation for the wave speed @xmath170 for @xmath171 we have @xmath172 which is a quantity usually close to @xmath173 and thus positive ( see the discussion below ) , then the quadratic equation becomes    @xmath174    with solutions @xmath175\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath176 and @xmath177 corresponding to right moving ( @xmath178 ) and left moving ( @xmath179 ) waves with respect to a _ moving _ observer , moving with the a velocity @xmath180 the reference frame for the _ moving _ observer is obtained by a galilean transformation @xmath181",
    "@xmath182 @xmath183 giving @xmath184 and @xmath185 consider the term @xmath186 .",
    "this evaluates to @xmath187    note that the term @xmath188 is the only term in the linearised equation that depends on @xmath38 but does not depend on the relative velocity @xmath189 .",
    "all other terms depend only on the difference @xmath189 .",
    "this is a consequence of the presence of the coriolis term representing non - inertial forces in our frame of reference .",
    "when @xmath190 the equations , of course , depend only on the relative difference @xmath189 .",
    "if @xmath191 there is a jump in the velocity component , tangent to the surface of the internal wave @xmath49 i.e. there is a vortex sheet , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "while such a situation is compatible with the inviscid euler s equations , in practical situations , where viscosity is always present , such jumps do not occur ( otherwise there will be a vortex sheet between the two media ) .",
    "for this reason in our further considerations we take @xmath192 this corresponds to the case where there is no vortex sheet at the boundary between the two layers at @xmath65 .",
    "recalling the hamiltonian in ( [ main_ham ] ) where , in this case , @xmath132 @xmath193\\int\\limits_{\\mathbb{r } } \\eta^2 dx+\\frac{1}{6}(\\rho\\gamma^2-\\rho_1\\gamma_1 ^ 2)\\ii   \\eta^3dx\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] noting re - normalisation to exclude any constant terms .",
    "we will study the equations under the additional approximation that the wavelengths @xmath194 are much bigger than @xmath195 and @xmath196 . since @xmath197",
    "thus for the wave number @xmath198 we have @xmath199 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath200 recall that the operator @xmath201 has an eigenvalue @xmath166 , thus we shall keep in mind that @xmath202 moreover the @xmath8-derivative of the velocity potentials do not get an extra factor of @xmath203 since @xmath204 of order @xmath137 remains unchanged .",
    "in other words the `` wave '' component of @xmath205 is @xmath206 and is of order @xmath207 hence @xmath208 and @xmath209    we write now all scale factors explicitly , and keep all remaining quantities non - dimensional and of order one .",
    "the dirichlet - neumann operators can hence be represented as @xmath210 and @xmath211    expanding the hyperbolic tangent functions the dirichlet - neumann operators can be represented as @xmath212 and @xmath213    @xmath134 , the non - dimensional form of @xmath156 , is given as : @xmath214 this can be written as @xmath215 and so @xmath216 using the expansion @xmath217 we obtain @xmath218    the hamiltonian expanded to terms of orders up to @xmath219 and @xmath220 has the form    @xmath221\\ii   \\eta^2 dx + \\frac{\\varepsilon^3}{6}(\\rho\\gamma^2-\\rho_1\\gamma_1 ^",

    "we will keep track only of the scale variables @xmath222 and not of the other dimensional factors . the hamiltonian has the following expansion to order @xmath223 :    @xmath224    where    @xmath225    the hamiltonian equations for the hamiltonian in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath226 are @xmath227    where for convenience @xmath228 that is a galilean change of coordinates . since",
    "@xmath229 rad / s , @xmath230 m / s , then @xmath231 and the @xmath232 term will be neglected .",
    "one can also exclude @xmath233 from the second equation , which leads to the system @xmath234    the linearised equations produce wave speeds @xmath235 for an observer , moving with the flow , i.e. there are left- ( @xmath236 sign ) and right - running ( @xmath237 sign ) waves . for a stationary observer the velocities are @xmath238 moreover ,",
    "in the leading approximation , @xmath239    one can look for a relation between @xmath11 and @xmath205 at the next order of approximation : @xmath240 for some constants @xmath241 and @xmath242 @xcite .",
    "then one can express @xmath205 via @xmath11 in both equations .",
    "the condition for the two equations to coincide with terms to order @xmath243 leads to the determination of @xmath241 and @xmath242 : @xmath244 thus @xmath205 can be expressed with @xmath11 to order @xmath243 via , and @xmath11 satisfies the kdv equation @xcite , that represents the coinciding terms of :    @xmath245    in the case when all vorticities are zero this simplifies to @xmath246    the kdv approximation for an internal wave coupled to a free surface is derived in @xcite .",
    "the kdv equation represents a balance between a nonlinearity term @xmath247 , and dispersion term @xmath248 reintroducing @xmath137 and @xmath249 it is clear that these terms are scaled like @xmath250 and @xmath251 so that when @xmath252 the interplay between nonlinearity and dispersion is producing smooth and stable in time soliton solutions . however , there are various geophysical scales and many other situations are possible , including @xmath253 in such case @xmath254 and instead of a kdv equation the relevant model is the dispersionless burgers equation ( @xmath255 )    @xmath256    such an equation does not support globally smooth solutions , i.e. the solutions always form a vertical slope and break .",
    "such wave - breaking phenomenon is well known for internal waves in the ocean .",
    "this is a mechanism that causes mixing in the deep ocean , with implications for biological productivity and sediment transport @xcite .",
    "there are other integrable systems which provide an approximation of the equations in the boussinesq regime , such as the kaup - boussinesq system investigated firstly by d.j .",
    "kaup @xcite . under the usual",
    "scaling the kb system is asymptotically equivalent to the kdv regime .",
    "however , from the point of view of the soliton theory , the kb system is by far more complex and sophisticated than the kdv equation .",
    "the soliton solutions of the kb system are not yet completely studied , although there are some special soliton solutions obtained in @xcite . other 2-component integrable systems , that can match the model equations up to order @xmath243 , are the 2-component camassa - holm system and the zakharov - ito system @xcite .",
    "we studied a two - media system of liquids with different densities , separated by an free internal surface .",
    "both the top and the bottom of the system are considered horizontal and flat .",
    "underlying currents with constant vorticities are present in both layers .",
    "the internal waves are formed at the interface between the layers due to gravity and coriolis forces .",
    "the model is aimed at geophysical applications , where a typical configuration is the one of a thin shallow layer of warm and less dense water over a much deeper layer of cold denser water .",
    "the two layers are separated by a sharp thermocline / pycnocline , where the internal waves are formed .",
    "the governing equations are written in a canonical hamiltonian form , which gives rise to a systematic approach for possible approximations .",
    "in particular , small amplitude and long - wave regimes are studied .",
    "there are various geophysical scales , allowing for smooth solitons at the kdv regime as well as breaking waves in the very large wavelengths , when the equations are asymptotically equivalent to the dispersionless burgers equation .",
    "a possible limitation of the model is the assumption of a flat surface , which apparently changes the nature of the internal waves . in the case of a free surface , even in the case of very small amplitudes , the internal wave ( in a linear approximation )",
    "is usually coupled to the surface wave .",
    "this has an impact on the possible propagation speeds @xcite .",
    "other asymptotic regimes , e.g. related to the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite remain to be studied .",
