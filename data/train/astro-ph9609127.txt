    "the evolution of extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars has attracted considerable interest in recent years due to their importance for understanding the hot stellar population in both metal - poor and metal - rich stellar systems ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) . according to canonical theory ,",
    "ehb stars retain only a thin ( @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) inert hydrogen envelope due to prior mass loss on the red giant branch ( rgb ) , and spend their core - helium burning lifetime at high effective temperatures ( 20,000 k @xmath2 t@xmath3@xmath2 35,000",
    "k ) . following the exhaustion of their central helium",
    ", ehb stars do not return to the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , but instead follow agb - manqu tracks , spending the rest of their pre - white dwarf lifetime at high temperatures and luminosities . because of their sustained hot phases , ehb and post - ehb stars are the most promising candidates for producing the ultraviolet excess observed in elliptical galaxies ( @xcite , dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 , @xcite ) .",
    "several scenarios have been suggested to explain the origin of the ehb stars . in the single star scenario ,",
    "ehb stars are produced by extensive mass loss along the rgb , which reduces the envelope mass to the very small values required by canonical ehb models .",
    "this scenario predicts that the ehb should appear as a well - defined extension of the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) in the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "the principal difficulty with this scenario is the fine tuning of the mass loss process needed to produce the narrow range of ehb envelope masses . to avoid this fine - tuning problem , dcruz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have suggested that some ehb stars might be `` hot he - flashers '' , i.e. stars which evolve off the rgb to high effective temperatures before igniting helium .",
    "such stars would settle onto a blue hook at the hot end of the hb .",
    "several binary scenarios have also been proposed , involving either roche lobe overflow along the rgb or the merger of a double helium white dwarf system ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these scenarios predict a wide range in the ehb mass and therefore a wide range in luminosity .",
    "theoretical ehb models have not been well - tested even in the globular clusters .",
    "the main observational difficulty has been the derivation of accurate luminosities and temperatures for a large sample of ehb and post - ehb stars , for comparison with theoretical predictions . in a standard ( v ,",
    "v ) cmd , the ehb is observed as a nearly vertical blue tail , and the effect of an increase in temperature is nearly degenerate with that of a decrease in luminosity .",
    "ultraviolet observations can provide the needed temperature discrimination , but , while previous ultraviolet experiments have yielded some intriguing discrepancies with canonical hot hb models ( whitney et al .",
    "1994 , dixon et al .",
    "1996 ) , they have lacked either the sensitivity or the spatial resolution for a clean confrontation with the theory .",
    "the recent non - canonical hb models of sweigart ( 1996 ) provide a further impetus for an observational test of ehb and post - ehb evolution .",
    "these models include the dredge - up of helium from the hydrogen shell on the rgb , as possibly suggested by the observed abundance anomalies in globular cluster red giants ( e.g.  langer & hoffman 1995 ) . a star which undergoes such helium mixing will arrive on the hb with an enhanced envelope helium abundance and",
    "therefore will lie blueward of its canonical location . in this scenario ,",
    "the high effective temperatures of the ehb stars are the due to a high envelope helium abundance , which considerably increases the envelope masses .",
    "thus the problem of fine - tuning the mass loss process is avoided .",
    "ngc 6752 is a nearby ( @xmath4  = 13.05 ) , lightly reddened ( e(b  v ) @xmath5 0.04 ) intermediate metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = 1.64 ) globular cluster with a blue hb and a large population of ehb stars ( buonanno et al .",
    "1986 , hereafter b86 ) .",
    "the quoted distance for ngc 6752 is taken from the recent hst observations of the white dwarf cooling curve by renzini et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter r96 ) , and thus is independent of any assumptions concerning the hb luminosity . in 1995 march , we imaged ngc 6752 at 1620    using the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) , which was part of the astro-2 space shuttle payload .",
    "the uit field of view ( @xmath6 ) is well matched to the cluster size , and its solar - blind csi detectors suppress the dominant cool star population and allow hot hb stars to be detected into the center of the cluster . in this _ letter _ , we combine the uit photometry with the visible photometry of b86 to derive temperatures and luminosities for a large sample of ehb and post - ehb stars for comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "the uit uses image - intensified film detectors and has a spatial resolution of about @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 6752 was observed with the b5 filter , which has a central wavelength of 1620  , and a width of about 225   ( @xcite ) . only the deepest ( 781s ) image ( fuv2619 )",
    "obtained on 08 mar 1995 is used here ( figure 1 , plate lxx ) .",
    "the magnitudes , @xmath8 , given in this _",
    "letter _ are defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mean flux through the b5 filter .",
    "the uv photometry was derived by psf fitting using an idl implementation of the daophot algorithms of stetson ( 1987 ) , with the error analysis modified for use with film .",
    "the complete uv photometry catalog , along with a discussion of the radial distribution of the hot hb stars , will be reported in a subsequent paper .",
    "the uit image of ngc 6752 shows five stars significantly brighter than the other 354 detected hot stars .",
    "three of these stars were classified as post - ehb stars by moehler , heber , & rupprecht ( 1996 ) , while one is interior to the annulus studied by b86 , and is designated here as uit-1",
    ". only one of these stars ( b1754 ) had been previously observed with _ iue _ , and",
    "so we have obtained short - wavelength ( swp ) , low - dispersion iue spectra of the other four ( table 1 ) .",
    "the _ iue _  spectra each show a hot continuum but have insufficient s / n to allow certain identification of any spectral features .",
    "the uit photometry is used to derive t@xmath3  and @xmath11   in table 1 , because the _ iue _  spectra of three of the post - ehb candidates ( b1754 , b2004 , uit-1 ) are contaminated by neighboring hot hb stars .    the absolute calibration was determined by comparison with the fourteen hb stars observed with _",
    "iue _  by cacciari et al .",
    "( 1995 ) plus the four new ones reported here .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "spectra were processed using the newsips reduction ( @xcite ) , but with the absolute calibration corrected to the bohlin ( 1996 ) scale .",
    "there is a standard deviation of 0.075 mag between the _ iue _  and uit fluxes , which is about what is expected for the two instruments .",
    "temperatures are derived from the @xmath8   v color using the lte model atmospheres of kurucz ( 1993 ) for [ fe / h ] = 1.5 and assuming e(b  v ) = 0.05 .",
    "this reddening value was adopted to yield the best agreement between our t@xmath3  values and those derived from balmer line fitting by moehler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and is close to the value of e(b  v ) = 0.04 tabulated by peterson ( 1993 ) .",
    "there is evidence for an increasing discrepancy between the two methods of determining t@xmath3  for t@xmath3  @xmath12 30,000 k ( with balmer line fitting yielding higher temperatures ) , perhaps because nlte effects are more important at these high temperatures , or perhaps because the v magnitudes are less reliable for the hottest ( and faintest ) hb stars .",
    "there is a 97% overlap between the hot ( b  v @xmath13 ) stars in the b86 catalog , and the stars detected on the uit image in the same area of the cluster ( roughly between @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the cluster center ) .",
    "ultraviolet fluxes could not be determined for three hb stars on the uit image that are too close to the heavily saturated foreground star hd 177999 .",
    "the spatial resolution of uit was insufficient to obtain useful photometry for the hot hb stars b1525 and b1532 , which are separated by @xmath16 .",
    "finally , two stars detected on the uit image could not be matched with any blue stars in b86 , and instead appear to be matched with `` red straggler '' stars with composite colors .",
    "b4840 ( v = 13.64 , b ",
    "v = 0.87 ) is likely a composite of a hot hb star and a red giant , while b1370 ( v = 16.09 , b ",
    "v = 0.33 ) is likely a composite of a hot hb star and a subgiant .",
    "further observations are needed to determine whether these composite colors indicate a physical association .",
    "figure 2 shows an ultraviolet - visible cmd for the 216 uit stars in common with b86 together with the canonical zero - age hb ( zahb ) from sweigart ( 1996 ) for a scaled - solar metallicity of z @xmath17 and a main - sequence helium abundance of y = 0.23 .",
    "as noted by b86 , the cmd shows a relative deficit of hb stars near @xmath8   v = 2.7 ( @xmath18 t@xmath3  @xmath5 4.25 ) .",
    "the two cool stars ( b1624 and b2044 ) which fall considerably below the zahb are probably either non - members or extreme blue stragglers .",
    "the distribution of hot stars shows excellent agreement with the theoretical zahb for the assumed distance and reddening , except that the hottest stars appear to be too faint by @xmath5 0.1  0.2 mag .",
    "this offset could be explained if the core mass in the ehb stars was @xmath5 0.01 ",
    "0.02 m@xmath1  smaller than the canonical value . in any case ,",
    "figure 2 suggests that the difference in the zahb luminosity between the ehb and bhb may be somewhat larger than predicted by canonical models .",
    "we note that the hot he flasher stars discussed by dcruz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are predicted to lie up to @xmath5 0.1 mag below the canonical zahb .",
    "however , such stars are constrained to a small temperature range around @xmath18 t@xmath3  @xmath5 4.5 ( @xmath8 v @xmath19 ) , and thus should appear as a blue hook at the hot end of the ehb .",
    "no such feature is evident in figure 2 .",
    "our observational data are plotted in the theoretical plane in figure 3 together with selected evolutionary tracks .",
    "figure 3 shows that the predicted luminosity width of the hb is in excellent agreement with the observations , with the width increasing from about 0.1 dex near @xmath18 t@xmath3  = 4.0 to about 0.25 dex near @xmath18 t@xmath3  = 4.5 .",
    "the ehb in ngc 6752 thus appears to be an extension of the bhb , as predicted by the single star scenario for the origin of the ehb stars .",
    "we next consider the four post - ehb stars t@xmath3",
    "@xmath5 4.2 and",
    "@xmath18 l @xmath5 1.8 in figure 3 is a possible fifth post - ehb star , although it appears to be somewhat too cool and faint to arise from post - ehb tracks . ] in figure 3 . the evolutionary tracks with zahb effective temperatures greater than @xmath18 t@xmath3  @xmath5 4.30 show a long - lived , hot , post - ehb phase .",
    "the theoretical lifetime of this post - ehb phase is typically 0.15  0.20 of the ehb lifetime itself .",
    "since the cmd contains 63 stars hotter than @xmath18 t@xmath3  = 4.30 , one would therefore expect about ten post - ehb stars , compared to the four actually found .",
    "we have done monte carlo simulations to determine the probability of finding only four post - ehb stars .",
    "stars are assigned a random age along the nearest evolutionary track , starting with a zahb distribution matched to the observed number and temperature distribution of the hb stars in ngc 6752 . in a set of 1000 such simulations",
    ", we find a median number of 11 post - ehb stars , and find fewer than five post - ehb stars in only 2.2% of the trials .",
    "the deficit of post - ehb stars in ngc 6752 also appears to persist for the stars for which we do not have optical photometry and hence colors .",
    "there are 134 sources on the uit image outside of the region studied by b86 , including 103 sources in the core , and 31 sources on the periphery of the cluster .",
    "but among these 134 sources , only uit-1 is sufficiently bright to be a good post - ehb candidate .",
    "note that a deficit of post - ehb stars in the core might be at least partially explained by the deficit of ehb stars reported there by shara et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "if the deficit of post - ehb stars in ngc 6752 is not a statistical anomaly , what changes might be required in the hb models ?",
    "one possibility would be to decrease the post - ehb lifetime relative to that of the ehb phase .",
    "it has sometimes been suggested that this lifetime ratio could be decreased by ehb models which include `` breathing pulses '' ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) , which are sudden increases in the size of the convective core near the end of the hb evolution . whether or not breathing pulses actually occur , however , remains an open question ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , sweigart ( 1994 ) has found that breathing pulses do not necessarily reduce the post - ehb lifetime below its canonical value .",
    "alternatively , the deficit of post - ehb stars might be explained by an increase in the critical temperature at which an hb star follows an agb - manqu track , instead of evolving rapidly back toward the agb .",
    "this explanation is supported by the high effective temperatures of the four post - ehb stars , suggesting that they are descendants of only the hottest ( @xmath18 t@xmath3@xmath12 4.5 ) hb stars . however , again it is not apparent what changes in the canonical models would produce such a change in the post - hb morphology .",
    "one ingredient missing from the canonical models is radiation - driven mass loss , which has been suggested as the cause of the change in surface abundance as stars evolve from helium - poor sdb stars on the ehb , to helium - rich sdo stars in the post - ehb phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , radiation - driven mass loss would remove additional mass from the envelope and hence would _ increase _ the number of stars that evolve along agb - manqu tracks .",
    "we next compare the present results with the helium - mixed models of sweigart ( 1996 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows two representative ehb and post - ehb tracks : one for a canonical sequence ( left panel ) and one for a helium - mixed sequence ( right panel ) .",
    "as discussed below , the helium - mixed sequence is shown using a best - fit distance modulus of @xmath4  = 13.30 , rather than the value of @xmath4  = 13.05 determined by r96 .",
    "the canonical sequence in figure 4 predicts a luminosity gap of @xmath20 dex between the end of the hb and the beginning of the post - ehb phase .",
    "this gap is a consequence of the interior readjustment that occurs as an hb star exhausts its central helium fuel and begins helium burning in a shell .",
    "the surface luminosity during the post - ehb phase gradually increases as the helium shell moves outward in mass , resulting in a rather large predicted luminosity range ( @xmath21 dex ) for the post - ehb stars .",
    "the helium - mixed sequence in figure 4 has a high envelope helium abundance ( @xmath22 ) due to dredge - up of helium during the preceding rgb phase , and consequently a much larger envelope mass than in canonical models of similar effective temperature ( @xmath23 m@xmath1versus @xmath24 m@xmath1 ) . due to this larger envelope mass",
    "the hydrogen shell reignites at the end of the hb phase .",
    "this , together with the increase in the helium - burning luminosity at that time , produces both a larger luminosity gap of @xmath25 dex between the hb and the post - ehb phases , and a smaller luminosity range for the post - ehb stars .",
    "figure 4 shows that the four post - ehb stars do cluster near the luminosities predicted by the helium - mixed track , but the observational and statistical uncertainties are large .    as noted above",
    ", the helium - mixed zahb is more luminous than the canonical zahb , and thus requires a larger distance modulus to fit the ngc 6752 data .",
    "however , the zahb luminosity of a helium - mixed ehb sequence depends on the mass of its helium core , which , in turn , depends on some extent on the mixing algorithm used along the rgb",
    ". the helium - mixed sequence in figure 4 , for example , would be consistent with the r96 distance scale if its core mass of 0.501 m@xmath1  were smaller by @xmath5 0.02 m@xmath1 .",
    "it is entirely possible that different mixing algorithms might produce such changes in the core mass .",
    "additional observations could help determine whether the deficit of post - ehb stars in ngc 6752 is a statistical anomaly , and if any modifications are needed to the canonical hb tracks .",
    "we have recently obtained a wide - field ubv ccd mosaic of ngc 6752 with the goal of improving upon the photographic photometry of b86 .",
    "in addition , hst photometry of the cluster core ( e.g. @xcite ) should allow the cmd to be extended to the entire cluster .",
