    "according to gray ( 1988 ) , @xmath0 boo type stars can be divided into two groups .",
    "stars in the first group have normal hydrogen - line ( nhl ) profiles , typical of the a dwarfs .",
    "the second group contains stars with peculiar hydrogen - line profiles ( phl ) .",
    "they have weak cores and broad , but shallow wings .",
    "strenburg ( 1993 ) has found a significant correlation between gray s classification and his gas shell index .",
    "this index is related to the presence of sharp circumstellar absorption details in the cores of some metallic lines like ca k and na d. the phl stars have strong signs of a gas shell , while the nhl stars show only weak indications .",
    "thus , the observational data clearly point to a connection between the @xmath0 boo phenomenon and circumstellar gas . here",
    "we report on the effective temperatures and gravities obtained from fits to theoretical hydrogen - line profiles , as well as on the gas shell signs found directly in the hydrogen - line spectrum of some phl @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "co - added photographic spectra obtained in the range @xmath3  36004800   with a moderate resolution @xmath4 are used for studying the hydrogen - line spectrum of eight @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "three of them : hd31295 , hd125162 , and hd183324 exhibit nhl profiles , while the others : hd 105058 , hd 111786 , hd 142703 , hd 192640 and hd 221756 show phl profiles .",
    "observed h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 profiles were compared with kurucz ( 1993 ) theoretical profiles computed with realistic ( low metal ) abundances .",
    "the line fitting procedure included a bicubic spline interpolation scheme and a @xmath5minimization in the two - dimensional parametric grid limited by @xmath66000k10000k and @xmath73.05.0 .",
    "the fitting procedure did not take in the innermost @xmath8    from the line center of the observed hydrogen lines .",
    "effective temperatures and gravities obtained from our ` best - fit ' theoretical profiles are listed in the table 1 .",
    "the dashes reflect the fact that hydrogen - line profiles are not sensitive to gravity below about 8300k .",
    "already published data are given for comparison .",
    "there are no significant differences between the effective temperatures obtained by different methods .",

    "the theoretical profiles were used as _",
    "continua_. residuals obtained for each star after the normalization are shown in figure 1 .",
    "weak ` emission - like ' details were found in the bottoms of h@xmath2 lines of five @xmath0 boo stars .",
    "taking into account the central depths of h@xmath2 lines , equivalent widths of the weak emissions in figure 1 can be found between 80 and 250 m .",
    "these values are less than two percent of the equivalent width of h@xmath2 lines .",
    "we found similar details with quite smaller amplitudes ( down to the limit of detection ) in h@xmath1 profiles .",
    "we used the inglis ",
    "teller formula that connects the electron density @xmath14 in the atmosphere with the number @xmath11 of the last resolved balmer line : @xmath15 both coefficients are taken from allen ( 1973 ) . as a rule , the @xmath14 value obtained from the inglis ",
    "teller formula is related to the uppermost atmospheric layers where optical depth @xmath16 and where the balmer lines with the highest numbers are formed . in practice ,",
    "the number @xmath11 is derived from the relation between balmer line number and central depth @xmath17 or equivalent width @xmath18 .",
    "an extrapolation of this relation towards the higher numbers gives @xmath11 as the point where @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 )  @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "it is obvious that in this case @xmath11 may be a fractional number .",
    "the values thus obtained for @xmath11 have been corrected for the rotation and for the spectral class by using the coefficients proposed by kopylov ( 1961 ) .",
    "the error in @xmath11 depends mainly on the number of points used and on the errors in the @xmath17 determination . with errors in @xmath17 between one and two percent",
    "the number @xmath11 in our case can be determined with a standard error of 0.2 .",
    "this value is consistent with the results of kopylov ( 1961 ) , who has found the errors in @xmath11 between 0.07 and 0.15",
    ". the error of about 0.2 in @xmath11 leads to an error in the resulting value of @xmath12 of about 0.050.06 .",
    "the last visible numbers are listed in table  1 along with the corresponding electron densities .",
    "the numbers @xmath11 measured by us for all the stars studied are in the range 18.220.1 .",
    "the distributions of @xmath11 suggest that the last resolved",
    "the main result form the last subsection is that @xmath14 at the level @xmath16 in the atmosphere of phl type stars is nearly twice lower than we derived for @xmath0  boo stars with nhl .",
    "this could be interpreted as some evidence that @xmath0  boo stars with phl are closer to the end of their evolution _ on  the  ms _ , because in the spectral range a0f0 @xmath11 reaches 17.0 for zams , 18.5 for the middle of the main sequence , and 20.0 for the luminosity classes iv  iii ( kopylov 1966 ) .",
    "an additional support to this interpretation could be seen even in the fact that the @xmath10 values of phl stars determined from photometric data are in general smaller than those of nhl stars .",
    "the contradiction with the suggestion of venn & lambert ( 1990 ) and gas / dust separation scenario developed by waters et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ( both of them require @xmath0 boo stars to be young and near the zams ) is obvious .",
    "the presence of gas shells or envelopes which surround many @xmath0 boo stars can change the situation upside - down , making phl stars to bear a resemblance to the well - known be or ae / shell stars . for example",
    ", pleione shows a b8v spectrum while in its quiescent mode , while during the shell phases @xmath11 has reached 40 .",
    "thus , the larger @xmath11 in the spectra of phl stars can be considered as yet another shell symptom .",
    "it is important to note that the influence of gas shells on the hydrogen - line spectrum of ae / shell stars which show weak or no emissions usually is much more visible in the highest balmer line numbers .",
    "this fact could explain why the @xmath20 indices and the corresponding effective temperatures of phl @xmath0 boo stars can be close to those obtained from spectroscopy , while the balmer discontinuity , and , therefore , luminosity indices like @xmath21 , _",
    "d  _ or @xmath22 can be affected by the shell .",
    "the conclusion is that @xmath10 values of phl stars obtained by photometry seem to need a revision , because stronger evidences for circumstellar shells imply more disturbed @xmath10 values .",
    "unfortunately , hydrogen - line profiles offer no alternative solution , since the effective temperatures of these stars are mostly below the critical limit of about 8300k .",
