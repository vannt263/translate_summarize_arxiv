    "the final hera - ii data on unpolarized deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure functions , combined with the present world data , will allow to reduce the experimental error on the strong coupling constant , @xmath0 , to the level of @xmath2% @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) analyses have intrinsic limitations which allow no better than @xmath3% accuracy in the determination of @xmath4 @xcite . in order to match the expected experimental accuracy ,",
    "analyses of dis structure functions need then to be carried out at the nnlo level , which requires the knowledge of the @xmath5function and anomalous dimensions at the 3-loop level and the massless and massive 2-loop wilson coefficients . with the recent computation of the 3loop anomalous dimensions @xcite , the whole scheme independent set of quantities",
    "is known , thus allowing a complete nnlo study of dis structure functions . at the same time",
    "we think that combining the standard qcd analysis and fits based on scheme - invariant evolution will provide a valuable tool to reduce theoretical and conceptual uncertainties in high - precision analyses aiming at @xmath2% accuracy .",
    "our final goal is to perform the full nnlo analysis of dis structure functions aiming at an high - accuracy determination of @xmath4 and the extraction of a set of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) with fully correlated errors .",
    "a complete analysis refers to both the singlet and non - singlet evolution . in the present letter",
    "we will concentrate only on the singlet sector , referring the reader to the recent non - singlet analysis @xcite .",
    "evolution equations of dis structure functions depend , in the standard qcd approach , on two arbitrary scales which are introduced in the calculation : the renormalization and the factorization scales .",
    "the renormalization scale dependence of any observable can be removed only summing the perturbative series to all orders .",
    "its presence is then unavoidable in any fixed order result .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the result on the variation of this unphysical scale can be used to give a rough estimate of the theoretical error due to higher order corrections .    on the other hand , if we consider the dependence of the result on the factorization scale we may follow two approaches .",
    "the first one is to consider the evolution of parton distribution functions which are process - independent but depend on the adopted factorization scheme .",
    "the second one is to study evolution equations for physical observables . in these equations",
    "the rle of anomalous dimensions for mass factorization is played by physical anomalous dimensions , which are independent of the factorization scheme but depend on the process and the observables considered .",
    "these two choices define what we call the standard qcd analysis and the scheme - invariant analysis",
    ".    in the standard qcd analysis one introduces a parameterization for the different pdfs at a given reference scale .",
    "the pdfs are then evolved up to the actual scale of the process , solving the evolution equations for mass factorization .",
    "structure functions are then constructed as a convolution of the pdfs and the corresponding wilson coefficients . as a last step , a multi - parameter fit",
    "is then performed to extract the value of the coupling constant and determine the parameters entering the pdf parameterization .    in a scheme - invariant analysis",
    "the parameterization of the observable at the reference scale @xmath6 is extracted from the data .",
    "the value of the observable at the scale @xmath7 is determined solving the evolution equations with physical anomalous dimensions as evolution kernels .",
    "finally a one - parameter fit is performed to extract the value of @xmath0 . once the analysis is completed the parton densities in any factorization scheme can be extracted along with the respective experimental errors .",
    "the advantage of considering factorization scheme invariant evolution equations for physical observables resides in the fact that the input distributions are observables",
    ". full exploitation of this advantage requires therefore high statistics measurements to minimize errors on the input distributions .",
    "furthermore , the correlations between the measured input distributions have to be considered in detail .",
    "once more we would like to stress that the two analyses are complementary and not mutually exclusive . thus performing both of them and comparing the extracted values of @xmath8 , or correspondingly @xmath9 ,",
    "provides a test of stability to determine the qcd parameter .",
    "when considering the singlet evolution the quark - singlet and gluon pdfs can be mapped into a pair of structure functions via the matrix of wilson coefficients , @xmath10 , @xcite  : @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) , as we will do in the following , we work in mellin space , where convolutions are ordinary products .",
    "the singlet evolution equations read @xmath12 where the evolution variable is @xmath13 the coupling constant @xmath14 is related to the usual strong interactions coupling via the relation @xmath15 and its expansion to 3-loops reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 the @xmath5 function is defined as @xmath18 and , in the case of @xmath19 , the coefficients entering up to 3-loops are @xmath20 with @xmath21 the number of flavors . the physical anomalous dimensions @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of the anomalous dimensions and the wilson coefficients as @xcite @xmath23 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 denotes the unpolarized anomalous dimensions which are related to the evolution kernels in @xmath25space by @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the mellin transforms of the wilson coefficients @xmath28 while the anomalous dimensions and the wilson coefficients are , separately , factorization - scheme dependent quantities , the combinations ( [ physad ] ) defining the physical anomalous dimensions are factorization scheme invariants , order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "different pairs of structure function can be taken into consideration , in particular :    * @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite ; * @xmath29 and @xmath31 @xcite .    in the case of polarized dis",
    "a combined @xmath32 and scheme invariant analysis was carried out to nlo for the structure functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xcite .    here",
    "we present the nnlo physical anomalous dimensions for the coupled evolution of the structure functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 , alongside with those at lo and nlo , cf .",
