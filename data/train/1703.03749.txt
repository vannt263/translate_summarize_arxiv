    "we consider the following general framework for decision under uncertainty : let @xmath12 be a decision variable while @xmath13 is a _ disturbance _ ( or _ noise _ ) parameter whose distribution @xmath1 ( with support @xmath2 ) is known , i.e. , its list of moments @xmath14 , @xmath15 , is available in closed form or numerically .",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are linked by constraints of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 for some polynomials @xmath20 $ ] , that is , @xmath21 is a basic semi - algebraic set .",
    "next , for each fixed @xmath22 , let @xmath23 be the ( possibly empty ) set defined by : @xmath24 let @xmath25 be fixed .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide tight approximations of the set @xmath26 in the form : @xmath27 where @xmath7 is a polynomial of degree at most @xmath8 .",
    "such approximations are particularly useful for optimization and control problems with chance - constraints ; for instance problems of the form : @xmath28 indeed one then replaces problem ( [ chance3 ] ) with @xmath29 where the uncertain parameter @xmath17 has disappeared .",
    "so if @xmath30 is a basic semi - algebraic set then ( [ chance4 ] ) is a standard polynomial optimization problem .",
    "of course the resulting decision problem ( [ chance4 ] ) may still be hard to solve because the sets @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not convex in general .",
    "but this may be the price to pay for avoiding a too conservative formulation of the problem",
    ".    however , in the formulation ( [ chance4 ] ) one has got rid of the disturbance parameter @xmath17 , and so one may apply the arsenal of non linear programming algorithms to get a local minimizer of ( [ chance4 ] ) . if @xmath33 is not too large or if some sparsity is present in problem ( [ chance4 ] ) one may even run a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations to approximate its global optimal value . for the latter approach the interested reader",
    "is referred to @xcite and for a discussion on approaches to various control problems with chance constraints we refer to the recent paper of jasour et al . @xcite and the references therein .    in jasour",
    "@xcite the authors have considered some control problems with chance constraints .",
    "they have provided an elegant formulation and a numerical scheme for solving the related problem of computing @xmath34 this problem is posed as an infinite - dimensional lp problem in an appropriate space of measures , that is , a generalized moment problem ( gmp ) as described in lasserre @xcite . then to obtain @xmath35 they solve a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations , which is the _ moment - sos _",
    "approach for solving the gmp .",
    "this gmp formulation has the particular and typical feature of including a constraint of _ domination _ @xmath36 between two measures @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "such domination constraints are particularly powerful and have been already used in a variety of different contexts .",
    "see for instance henrion et al .",
    "@xcite for approximating the lebesgue volume of a compact semi - algebraic set , lasserre @xcite for computing gaussian measures of semi - algebraic set , lasserre @xcite for  approximating \" the lebesgue decomposition of a measure with respect to another one .",
    "it has been used by henrion and korda @xcite for approximating regions of attraction , by korda et al .",
    "@xcite for approximating maximum controlled invariant sets , and more recently in jasour and lagoa @xcite for a unifying treatment of some control problems .",
    "the approach that we propose for determining the set @xmath32 defined in ( [ chance2 ] ) is very similar in spirit to that in @xcite and @xcite and can be viewed as an additional illustration of the versatility of the gmp and the moment - sos approach in control related problems .",
    "indeed we also define an infinite - dimensional lp problem @xmath39 in an appropriate space of measures and a sequence of semidefinite relaxations @xmath40 of @xmath39 , whose associated monotone sequence of optimal values @xmath41 converges to the optimal value @xmath42 of @xmath39 .",
    "an optimal solution of the dual of @xmath43 allows to obtain a polynomial @xmath7 of degree @xmath44 whose super - level set @xmath45 is precisely the desired approximation @xmath32 of @xmath31 in ( [ chance2 ] ) ; in fact the sets @xmath46 provide a sequence of _ outer _ approximations of @xmath31 .",
    "we also provide the strong asymptotic guarantee that @xmath47 where @xmath10 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath11 , which to the best of our knowledge is the first result of this kind at this level of generality .",
    "( the same methodology applied to chance - constraints of the form @xmath48 would provide a sequence of _ inner _ approximations of the set @xmath49 . )    another contribution is to include a technique to accelerate the convergence @xmath50 which otherwise can be too slow .",
    "this technique is different from the one used in @xcite for the related problem of computing the volume of a semi - algebraic set , and has the nice feature or preserving the _ monotonicity _ of the convergence of @xmath50 .",
    "it can be applied whenever @xmath51 is the lebesgue measure @xmath52 on @xmath53 or @xmath54 or @xmath55 for some homogeneous nonnegative polynomial @xmath56 .    at last but not least ,",
    "in principle we can also treat the case where the support @xmath53 of @xmath1 and the set @xmath21 are not compact , which includes the important case where @xmath1 is the normal distribution .",
    "we briefly explain what are the ( technical ) arguments which allow to extend the method to the non compact case .",
    "of course this methodology is computationally expensive and so far limited to relatively small size problems ( but after all the problem is very hard ) .",

    "therefore : @xmath158 where @xmath150 follows from @xmath159 on @xmath21 .",
    "finally the convergence @xmath160 follows from theorem [ th1 ] .",

    "as @xmath50 as @xmath99 , @xmath169 whence the convergence to @xmath165 in @xmath166 .",
    "then convergence @xmath170 in @xmath10-measure , and @xmath10-almost sure convergence for a subsequence follow from standard results from real analysis .",
    "see e.g. ash ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.5.1 ) .",
    "as we next see , the convergence @xmath171 in @xmath10-measure established in corollary [ conv ] will be useful to obtain strong asymptotic guarantees .",

    "[ cor - final ] with @xmath31 as in ( [ chance1 ] ) , let @xmath172 where @xmath173 is as in theorem [ th3 ] , @xmath6 .",

    "in the previous section we have provided a converging sequence @xmath46 of outer approximations of @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , the same methodology now applied to a chance constraint of the form @xmath183 would provide a converging sequence of _ inner _ approximations of the set @xmath184 .      as we already have seen in section [ section - stokes ] for the semidefinite program ( [ primal ] ) , as @xmath99 the convergence @xmath50 of the optimal value of ( [ chance - lp - relax ] )",
    "can also be slow due to the gibb s effect that appears in the dual ( [ chance - lp - dual ] ) when approximating the indicator function @xmath185 by a polynomial .",
    "so assume that @xmath1 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath53 scaled to be a probability measure ( but the same idea works if @xmath186 , or if @xmath187 for some homogeneous polynomial @xmath109 ) .",
    "then again we propose to include additional constraints on the moments @xmath74 in ( [ chance - lp - relax ] ) coming from additional properties of the optimal solution @xmath111 of ( [ chance - lp ] ) .",

    "for each fixed @xmath190 , the polynomial @xmath191 vanishes on the boundary @xmath192 of @xmath129 .",

    "is assumed to follow a normal distribution @xmath1 on @xmath202 .",
    "therefore @xmath53 is not compact anymore and the machinery used in @xcite can not be applied directly .",
    "however the normal distribution satisfies the important carleman s property .",
    "that is , let @xmath203 be the riesz functional associated with @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath204 for all @xmath205 $ ]",
    ". then @xmath206 in particular @xmath1 is _ moment determinate _ ,",
    "that is , @xmath1 is completely determined by its moments .",
    "these two properties have been used extensively in e.g. lasserre @xcite and also in @xcite , precisely to show that with @xmath207 not necessarily compact , one may still approximate its gaussian measure @xmath208 as closely as desired .",
    "again one solves ( [ th1-eq1 ] ) via the same hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations ( [ primal ] ) ( but now with @xmath1 instead of @xmath10 ) . for more details the interested reader",
    "is referred to lasserre @xcite .    in view of the above ( technical ) remarks ,",
    "one may then extend the machinery described in  [ main ] for the case where @xmath202 , @xmath1 is the gaussian measure , and @xmath129 ( @xmath22 ) is not necessarily compact . a version of stokes theorem for non compact sets is even described in @xcite to accelerate the convergence of the semidefinite relaxations ( [ primal ] ) ( with @xmath1 instead of @xmath10 ) .",
    "it can be used to accelerate the convergence of the semidefinite relaxations ( [ chance - lp - relax ] ) , exactly as we do in  [ accelerate ] for the compact case .",
    "we have presented a systematic numerical scheme to provide an sequence of outer approximations @xmath209 of the feasible set @xmath31 associated with chance constraints of the form @xmath210 .",
    "each outer approximation @xmath32 is the @xmath165-super level set of some polynomial whose coefficients are computed via solving a certain semidefinite program . as @xmath8 increases @xmath211 , a nice and highly desirable asymptotic property .",
    "of course this methodology is computationally expensive and limited to problems of small size .",
    "but we hope it can pave the way to define more efficient heuristics ( perhaps at the price of loosing the nice asymptotic properties ) . also checking whether this methodology can accommodate potential sparsity patterns",
