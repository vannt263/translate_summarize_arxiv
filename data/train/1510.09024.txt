    "turbulent aerosols , dilute solutions of solid particles transported by turbulent flows , are important to the environment and to industry . from combustion processes in coal fire burners , to the dynamics of droplets in clouds , turbulent aerosols impact on our life and the earth s climate @xcite .",
    "one general feature of turbulent aerosols is their ` unmixing ' while transported by the flow , which is relevant to several processes including : warm - rain initiation @xcite , planetesimal formation in the early solar system @xcite , chemical reactions and industrial processes @xcite . in recent years",
    "much attention has been gathered by the dissipative dynamics resulting from particle inertia which can induce small - scale fractal clustering also in homogeneous flows @xcite .",
    "this can have relevant consequences for the rate of collision , coalescence and reaction of particles .",
    "another well known unmixing mechanism in turbulent aerosols is turbophoresis : inertial particles migrating in regions of lower turbulent diffusivity , similarly to thermophoresis  @xcite , for which brownian particles are subject to an effective drift opposite temperature gradients .",
    "turbophoresis has been mostly studied in presence of boundaries , because as a mechanism for particle deposition in turbulent boundary layers @xcite it finds applications both for industrial processes ( for removing submicron sized particles from gas streams ) and the environment ( dry deposition in the atmosphere  @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , the mechanism of turbophoresis is independent of the presence of boundaries as , in principle , it only requires the presence of inhomogeneities in the flow .    in this work",
    "we investigate the phenomenology of turbophoresis in a turbulent shear flow without walls .",
    "we point out the differences between this mechanism which causes inhomogeneity at large scales and the small - scale clustering which occurs at viscous scales .",
    "as a paradigmatic case of inhomogeneous unbounded flow , we consider the turbulent kolmogorov flow , obtained by sustaining the navier - stokes equations for the incompressible velocity field @xmath0 , @xmath1 with a sinusoidal force @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the pressure , @xmath4 the fluid kinematic viscosity , and @xmath5 denotes the unit vector along the horizontal direction .",
    "the laminar fixed point ( @xmath6 , with @xmath7 ) becomes unstable above a critical reynolds number @xcite , @xmath8 , and the flow eventually becomes turbulent for large @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "a remarkable peculiarity of monochromatic forcing is that the resulting mean velocity profile , @xmath10 , is monochromatic also in the turbulent regimes @xcite . above and in the following ,",
    "the brackets @xmath11 denote the average over @xmath12 and over time , while . due to the change of direction of the mean flow every half wavelength ,",
    "the kolmogorov flow can be seen as an array of virtual channels flowing in alternate directions without being confined by material boundaries .",
    "the dynamics of a small spherical particle is described by the maxey - riley equation  @xcite . here , we focus on dilute suspensions of very small particles much heavier than the fluid , whose dynamics is dominated by the stokes drag . in this limit",
    ", the equations for the position @xmath13 and velocity @xmath14 of each particle simplify to @xmath15\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the stokes time , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the particle radius and density , respectively while @xmath19 denotes the fluid density .",
    "( [ eq : mr]-[eq : mr2 ] ) assumes a stokes flow around the particle , implying that the particle s reynolds number must be very small : .",
    "particle inertia is commonly parametrized in terms of the stokes number @xmath20 based on the kolmogorov time @xmath21 , i.e. , the smallest characteristic time of a turbulent flow .",
    "however , turbophoretic effects are expected to be determined by large - scale features of the flow , namely by the interplay between the advection and the inhomogeneities of the eddy diffusivity  @xcite .",
    "we therefore introduce a particle inertia parameter @xmath22 by normalizing the particle response time @xmath23 with the large - scale eddy turnover time @xmath24 , defined as the ratio between the mean kinetic energy @xmath25 and the energy dissipation rate @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is the analogous of @xmath28 , which is used in wall - bounded flows to parametrize turbophoresis@xcite in terms of the friction velocity @xmath29 .",
    "this amounts to measuring times in wall units , which control the scaling of inhomogeneities across the wall region .    , plotted over the corresponding streamwise component of velocity ( color map , red to yellow online ) .",

    "[ fig:1 ] . to reveal the correlations of particle positions with the shear - normal structure of the flow it is necessary to consider statistically averaged quantities .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows typical fluid velocity and particle number - density profiles obtained by averaging over the @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions ( normal to the shear ) and over very long integration of hundreds of large - eddy - turn - over - times .",
    "the modulation of the density profiles closely reflects the structure of the mean flow : particles concentrate in the regions of maximal mean flow and minimal mean shear , away from the maxima of turbulent energy .    as it is shown in ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , the particle density profiles are accurately fitted by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean uniform density and the only free - parameter is @xmath53 , which accounts for the dependence on the particles inertia . in the following",
    "we discuss a heuristic argument which gives support to the empirical formula ( [ eq : profile ] ) .",
    "a common approach to derive theoretical predictions for the dynamics of inertial particles is by modeling the velocity field as a gaussian , short - correlated noise @xcite . with this assumption",
    ", one can write@xcite a fokker - planck equation for the probability density @xmath54 to find a particle in @xmath55 with vertical velocity @xmath56 , in which turbulence is parametrized by a space - dependent eddy diffusivity @xmath57 acting on velocity and derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mr2 ] ) .",
    "it is then possible , in the limit of fast relaxation of the velocity distribution  @xcite , to obtain an equation for the marginal distribution @xmath58 , which reads @xmath59 , where the flux is @xmath60 $ ] . for the fluxless steady state one obtains the prediction @xmath61 which , in analogy with thermophoresis  @xcite , implies that particles concentrate in the minima of diffusivity .",
    "this behaviour is substantially different from that of a classical , passively advected scalar field @xmath62 , where the eddy - diffusivity would appear in the flux in the fickian form @xmath63 , leading to a homogeneous steady state .",
    "standard dimensional arguments suggest that the eddy diffusivity is proportional to the mean square velocity @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 an appropriate correlation time ) , so that the above result implies @xmath66 . in the case of the kolmogorov flow , the profile of the mean square vertical velocity",
    "is found to be @xmath67 , with @xmath68 and weakly depending on re  @xcite .",
    "using a first - order taylor expansion in @xmath69 one recovers the expression ( [ eq : profile ] ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that the above argument relies on two assumptions .",
    "first , the correlation time of the flow is set to zero .",
    "second , the particle stokes time @xmath23 is assumed to be small enough to justify the fast relaxation of the velocity distribution . in this limit",
    "the amplitude of the spatial modulation of the particle density profile would not depend on @xmath27 , namely @xmath70 .",
    "the latter , quantitative prediction does not hold if the flow has a finite correlation time , as in our case . however , we find that eq .",
    "( [ eq : profile ] ) gives the correct shape for the density profile for particles with stokes times both shorter and longer than the correlation time of the flow , provided that the amplitude @xmath53 is allowed to depend on inertia .",
    "the analogy with thermophoresis can be exploited for particles with large inertia . in this limit",
    ", the particles can be seen as a gas in equilibrium with the turbulent environment and we can interpret the spatial variations of the mean particle vertical velocity variance , @xmath71 , as the analogous of a space - dependent temperature field @xcite . assuming the local diffusivity proportional to the temperature , i.e. @xmath72 , the particle density profile is therefore expected to be @xmath73 , which is in fairly good agreement with numerical results for large @xmath27 ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we find that the particle velocity profile @xmath74 has the same spatial dependence as the fluid one @xmath44 , but the amplitude of the spatial modulation decreases at increasing inertia .",
    "this leads to the prediction that the amplitude @xmath53 in  ( [ eq : profile ] ) is a decreasing function of the inertia for large @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath75 ( filled circles ) at @xmath76 .",
    "the particle distribution is compared the prediction @xmath77 ( empty circles ) .",
    "statistical fluctuations are due to the slow convergence observed for large @xmath27 . ]    the scenario is different for particles whose stokes time is of the order of the eddy - turn - over times in the inertial range of turbulence .",
    "such particles are able to follow only turbulent eddies of size @xmath78 with a turn - over time , @xmath79 , longer than their stokes time , i.e. @xmath80 .",
    "smaller eddies still act as a colored noise giving raise to a space - dependent effective diffusivity responsible for turbophoresis .",
    "conversely , eddies with @xmath80 mix the particles almost like tracers , thus reducing the turbophoretic accumulation .",
    "turbophoretic unmixing is therefore enhanced as @xmath27 increases , because a larger fraction of eddies contribute to it . assuming that the profile of the effective diffusivity due to the small eddies has a monochromatic modulation one recovers the prediction  ( [ eq : profile ] ) in which @xmath53 increases with @xmath27 for small values of @xmath27",
    "hence , we expect that @xmath53 attains its maximum when the particle response time is of the same order of the characteristic time of the large - scale structures of the flow ( @xmath81 ) .    at the heart of the arguments discussed above , there is the notion that turbophoresis drives particles away from the maxima of turbulent energy , which correspond to maxima of the eddy diffusivity . in the case of the kolmogorov flow , the maxima of turbulent fluctuations occur where the shear of the mean flow is maximum and the mean flow vanishes , i.e. , at the borders between the virtual channels .",
    "therefore , particles are driven toward the center of the virtual channels .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of a turbulent channel ( or pipe ) flow , in which turbulence is intense in the bulk and vanishes in the viscous sub - layer close to the walls . in this case",
    "turbophoresis drives the particles away from the bulk and concentrates them along the walls @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the fact that turbophoresis may eventually accumulate the particles to regions of large or small mean velocity ( or mean shear ) is an incidental ( albeit relevant for applications ) consequence of the details of the particular flow considered .     from the homogeneous distribution plotted as a function of @xmath27 for @xmath82 ( grey curve ) and @xmath83 ( black curve ) .",
    "the thickness of the curves reflects the statistical fluctuations around the mean value . ]",
    "the overall effect of turbophoresis can be quantified by means of the rms relative deviation of the mean density profile @xmath46 from the uniform distribution @xmath84 as @xmath85^{1/2}$ ] . for the specific profile  ( [ eq : profile ] ) , clearly we have @xmath86 .",
    "this quantity is plotted in fig.[fig:4 ] as a function of the inertia parameter . in agreement with expectations , the turbophoretic effect is not monotonic as a function of inertia .",
    "it displays a maximum at @xmath87 .",
    "the shape of the curves is not strongly affected by changing @xmath9 even though we observe , within the statistical uncertainties , a weak dependence of the position of the maximum .",
    "remarkably , deviations from the uniform distribution are present also for particles whose stokes time is much smaller than the kolmogorov time .",
    "arguments based on local variations of the eddy diffusivity can not be used to explain the origin of such inhomogeneities , because the particle relaxation time is shorter that the shortest eddy - turnover time of the flow .",
    "the mechanism responsible for such inhomogeneities also for @xmath88 is related to the weak compressibility of the particle velocity field . when @xmath88 , expanding at first order in @xmath23 the velocity of the particle one has @xmath89 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the mean vertical profile of the divergence of the particle velocity field is @xmath90 .",
    "the mean divergence is positive in the maxima of @xmath44 and is negative in the minima , providing an explanation for the accumulation of inertial particles in the minima of @xmath91 , observed at very weak inertia .      besides the large - scale effects discussed above , inertial particles transported in a turbulent flow display small - scale clustering .",
    "small - scale spatial inhomogeneities originate from the dissipative dynamics in the @xmath92-dimensional position - velocity phase space @xmath93 @xcite . in particular",
    ", inertial particle motion asymptotically takes place on a ( multi-)fractal set in phase space .",
    "a fractal dimension smaller than space dimension signals an enhanced probability to find particle pairs at short separation .",
    "indeed , the probability to find particle pairs at separation below a certain @xmath94 ( smaller than the kolmogorov scale ) grows as @xmath95 , with @xmath96 for uniformly distributed particles in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the correlation dimension @xmath97 is thus commonly used as a measure of clustering . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we plot the co - dimension @xmath98 as a function of @xmath99 for two values of @xmath9 . in agreement with previous results obtained in homogeneous , isotropic turbulence ( hit)@xcite , we find that the fractal co - dimension has only a very weak dependence on re .",
    "moreover , we find that it is not affected by the large - scales inhomogeneities of the kolmogorov flow @xcite as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] where published data for @xmath97 of heavy particles from a hit simulation @xcite are shown for comparison@xcite .",
    "on the contrary , the turbophoretic clustering measured by @xmath100 plotted as a function of @xmath101 has a strong dependence on @xmath9 : the maximum is attained for larger @xmath101 as @xmath9 increases ( see fig.[fig:5 ] ) .     of particle distributions ( filled symbols ) and",

    "]    the different @xmath9-dependence of the two phenomena reflects their different nature .",
    "the small - scale clustering is due to the chaotic dynamics at viscous scales , therefore it is most effective at @xmath104 , i.e. when @xmath105 .",
    "conversely , turbophoresis is the result of the transport of particles across the large - scale inhomogeneities of the flow .",
    "its effects is maximum for particles with response time of the order of the large - scale eddy turnover time @xmath41 , i.e , at @xmath106 .",

    "we have investigated the phenomenon of turbophoresis and fractal clustering of heavy inertial particles in the bulk of inhomogeneous flow , by performing dns of the dynamics of heavy particles transported by the turbulent kolmogorov flow .",
    "the emerging scenario in the limit of large re is the following .",
    "the distribution of particles with small inertia is characterized by a strong fractal clustering at small scales , but is weakly affected by turbophoresis . on the contrary , particles with large inertia experience strong turbophoretic accumulation at large scales while remaining uniformly distributed at small scales .",

    "particle density is maximal in the minima of the turbulent eddy diffusivity , which for the case of the kolmogorov flow coincides with the maxima of the mean flow .",
