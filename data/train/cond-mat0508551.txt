    "an equation - free framework has recently been developed as a means of computationally analyzing the dynamical behavior of a large class of complex , multiscale dynamical systems .",
    "the systems may be either stochastic or deterministic with many of degrees of freedom and subject to random initial data .",
    "the key observation behind the equation - free framework is that in many cases the quantities of interest are averages or low - order moments of evolving distributions which are smooth in space and time and which evolve effectively as closed , low - dimensional systems . in effect",
    "the low - order moments evolve as though they are governed by reduced closed equations , even though the reduced equations are not analytically available .",
    "algorithms for performing scientific computing tasks such as numerical integration , or bifurcation and stability analysis of these unavailable reduced equations have been developed ( e.g. coarse projective integration , coarse newton - gmres , see @xcite and references therein ) . these algorithms are based on traditional , continuum numerical analysis ,  wrapped \" around direct fine - scale simulation . the purpose of this paper is to establish a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of coarse dynamics and coarse bifurcation methods on problems which exhibit metastable behavior .",
    "the systems we consider are exemplified by the following model .",
    "a particle , called the distinguished particle , with position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 sits in a potential well @xmath2 .",
    "it is coupled via linear springs to a large number @xmath3 of particles comprising a heat bath ; see figure  [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the potential well considered here is a slightly asymmetric double well .",
    "the full system is an @xmath4 degree of freedom hamiltonian system .",
    "a detailed description of the model , including the choice of spring constants , masses , and initial data for the bath particles is given below and in @xcite .",
    "the important point is that the dynamics of this simple model ( and the others that we consider in this paper ) is typical of many more complex molecular and stochastic systems in which the state is primarily confined to a few conformations ( here defined by the minima of @xmath5 ) with rare switching events between them .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : intro_qp ] with a typical trajectory and time series for the distinguished particle .",

    ", the density evolves to the bimodal equilibrium distribution and is hence far from gaussian .",
    "thus the system exhibits _ metastability _ with near equilibration within one well dominating over medium time scales , before the system ultimately converges to an equilibrium distribution which sees both wells .",
    "the time it takes the system to reach equilibrium clearly depends on the potential barrier height ; the time scale of the intermediate time evolution to the well bottom depends only on properties of the particular well .",

    "such phenomena can be illustrated in both sde models , and in the ode heat bath model .",
    "furthermore , in various parameter limits , the sdes can be derived as approximations for the heat bath , further justifying their study .",

    "the @xmath20-th heat bath particle has mass @xmath21 and interacts with the distinguished particle via a linear spring with stiffness constant @xmath22 .",
    "if the distinguished particle were held fixed it would be the anchor point of @xmath3 independent oscillators with frequencies @xmath23 .",
    "the numerical experiments are all conducted with mass @xmath24    initial conditions for the distinguished particle are : @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the initial data for the heat bath particles , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are randomly drawn from a gibbs distribution with inverse temperature @xmath29 .",
    "the gibbs measure is conditioned by the ( non - random ) initial data @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for fixed @xmath16",
    "the hamiltonian is quadratic in @xmath32 , and hence the corresponding measure is gaussian .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath33 where @xmath34 are mutually independent sequences of i.i.d .",
    "random variables .",
    "this leaves the specification of the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath21 . for our purposes the only important property of these parameters",
    "is that the frequencies @xmath23 cover an increasingly large range in an increasingly dense manner as the number of particles @xmath3 increases .",
    "hence what we actually specify is the frequencies .",

    "this damped hamiltonian system exhibits decay towards stationary points with zero velocity and positions at the critical points of @xmath48 the presence of noise ( finite @xmath29 ) then induces transitions between the minima of @xmath5 , with time - scales determined by the well - depths relative to the size of noise .",
    "the stochastic dynamics between potential wells are also present in simple one dimensional sdes .",
    "a particular instance of such a one dimensional sde follows from for @xmath49 . in the limit @xmath50 , the solutions of converge strongly @xcite or weakly @xcite to solutions of the sde @xmath51 we will use this problem to illustrate the moment map , and its properties on systems exhibiting metastable dynamics within potential wells .      in most respects the sde systems derived above are simpler to treat , and",
    "computationally they are far less expensive to simulate than the full heat bath model .",
    "therefore , when we later use these models as examples , we will study the models in the opposite order from what has just been presented .",
    "we start with the 1d sde and examine its behavior extensively and then consider more briefly 2d sde and the heat bath system of odes .",
    "the central objects of our study are maps on moments .",
    "the basic ingredients are an evolution equation ( either an sde or system of odes ) , a space of low - order moments , and a measure determined uniquely by low - order moments .",
    "we refer to the latter as _ lifting _ and choice of the lifting operator is an essential ingredient in the method .",
    "we start with the sde case , then describe the situation for odes . for both the sde and the odes the flow on probability densities is linear .",

    "let @xmath42 be a measure on @xmath61 determined by exactly @xmath13 moments , with density @xmath62 here @xmath63 denotes the dependence of the density on the @xmath13 moments and we require that the @xmath13 moments of @xmath64 are exactly those given by @xmath65    we now define the map @xmath12 on @xmath13 moments by @xmath66 where the initial data @xmath67 is distributed with density @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( note that if @xmath70 then @xmath12 is the identity . ) we refer to this as the _ moment map_. it depends on three choices that need to be made when calculating the moment map :    a.   the evolution time @xmath71 ; b.   the _ number _ of moments we choose to use ; c.   the lifting step : the way choose to distribute the initial density based on the moments .",
    "we will return to this dependence in more detail below .",
    "the two examples of the measures which will be used throughout this paper are the dirac measure and the gaussian measure , uniquely determined by the first moment and the first two moments , respectively .    in practice",

    "it is helpful to consider figure  [ fig : mm ] illustrating the definition of the moment map .",
    "one should view the map as a composition of three steps : ( 1 ) _ lifting _ from a space of moments ( subset of @xmath61 ) to a space of probability densities ( captured by our choice of @xmath82 ) ; ( 2 ) time evolution of the density by the underlying process ( a linear flow , given by the map @xmath83 ) ; ( 3 ) projection back to moment space by integrating against the time - evolved measure .     in moment",

    "this point is defined to be the image of @xmath86 under the moment map .",

    "let @xmath94 then @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 and @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 there is a connection between particle filters and the moment map , although the former represent the desired density as a sum of several delta functions , or gaussians , not just as one @xcite .",
    "the moment map can be defined for deterministic problems of the form @xmath99 here @xmath100 and @xmath101 and the randomness is assumed to come entirely from the initial data . in systems characterized by a separation of time scales , it is sometimes the case that one can write an effective reduced models in terms of a subset of ( typically slow ) variables . under such appropriate conditions , we might , for example , be interested in finding a map in terms of the first @xmath13 moments of @xmath59 alone .",
    "thus the measure @xmath42 must be chosen on @xmath102 so that it is uniquely characterized by @xmath63 , the first @xmath13 moments of @xmath100 .",
    "it is natural to choose @xmath42 to be an invariant measure for the flow , conditioned by knowledge of the first @xmath13 moments of @xmath59 ; if the flow is hamiltonian then a gibbs measure is often used .",
    "we denote the density associated with this measure by @xmath103 this occurs in the heat bath example considered in the introduction where @xmath59 represents coordinate and momentum of the distinguished particle , whilst @xmath104 represents the heat bath coordinates and momenta .    rather than the fokker - planck equation",

    "_ lifting _ initialization of the detailed simulation consistently with coarse - grained observables is the _ lifting _ step in equation - free computation @xcite .",
    "this step is obviously not unique , as there exist many ways of initializing a distribution conditioned on a few of its lower order moments .",
    "our choice of a particular measure depending only on the lower order moments allows for a systematical initialization of the fine scale dynamics , a concept that goes back to ehrenfest @xcite , and is an important component of our computational approach . in the case of systems with metastability ,",
    "different effective dynamics will be deduced ( different closures will be obtained ) depending ( a ) on the time scale of the observation ( the time horizon of the simulation @xmath71 with the fine scale solver ) and ( b ) on the nature of the lifting from the moments ( the choice of @xmath122 ) . over very short times , and initializing with a dirac delta function , the simulation will effectively sample the local gradient of the well ; over medium times , and initializing _ within one well _",
    ", one will observe equilibration within this well ; and over very long times ( no matter what the initialization ) one will observe the approach to the equilibrium density . if we want to study the system over medium time scales , it is obviously important to use a time @xmath71 in the construction of the moment map that is short compared to the escape time between wells , but long enough for the noise ( dynamics ) to allow the sampling of the features of the well bottom . on a longer time - scale it is necessary to incorporate the transition time between wells as is done , for example , in the method of conditional averaging @xcite .",

    "this system provides the simplest example of a nonlinear moment map . in particular",
    "this example shows how the moment map can stabilize metastable densities of the underlying linear flow .",
    "we have additionally presented numerical results for moment maps computed for two other systems with double - well potentials - a two - dimensional sde and a deterministic ode system with many degrees of freedom .",
    "maps for both of these systems show the basic features found for the one - dimensional sde , namely nonlinearity and the stabilization of metastable densities .",
    "one of the important issue that arises naturally in this computational framework is the importance of _ the observer_. how long does a physical observer have to wait before declaring that an observed quantity is at steady state ?",
    "this is clearly related to our testing the dependence of the map fixed points to the map reporting horizon .",
    "we also saw that the initialization of computational experiments ( whether within or not within a well ) can be vital in the existence of an effective reduced model ( this is related , as we mentioned , to conditional averaging techniques ) .",
