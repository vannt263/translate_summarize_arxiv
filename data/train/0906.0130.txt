    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the muon are among the most precisely measured observables in particle physics .",
    "comparing the theoretical and experimental predictions for the muon magnetic moment there is currently a @xmath0 discrepancy  @xcite with the standard model ( sm ) which makes this observable very interesting at the moment .",
    "we calculate finite light quark mass contributions to the chromomagnetic moment of quarks , and obtain , as a byproduct , the corresponding corrections to the above mentioned observables and can confirm the results of refs .",
    "another byproduct of our calculation is the anomalous magnetic moment of heavy quarks , the bottom quark in particular , where we include the effect of a finite charm quark mass .",
    "the magnetic moment of quarks has not yet been measured experimentally , however , for the bottom and the lighter quarks there are upper limits from lep1 data  @xcite . due to the lack of space in these proceedings we will present analytic results for this observable in ref .  @xcite .    whereas the anomalous magnetic moments of fermions are physical observables , the chromomagnetic moment is not .",
    "nevertheless , it plays a crucial role in hqet , where it enters the matching coefficient of the chromomagnetic interaction operator  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop correction to the chromomagnetic moment has been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the two - loop calculation has been performed , whereas light quark mass effects to this order have been obtained in ref .",
    "an estimation of higher order corrections has then been given in ref .",
    "@xcite and the three - loop correction with one mass scale was finalized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter",
    "the aforementioned matching coefficient of hqet is almost trivially obtained from the chromomagnetic moment . in the case with two mass scales ,",
    "additional diagrams have to be calculated in the effective theory to match it to full qcd .",
    "we will present the matching coefficient in ref .",
    "@xcite and restrict the following discussion to the chromomagnetic moment .",
    "the results given in these proceedings have been published in ref .",
    "sample diagrams contributing to the quark chromomagnetic moment .",
    "double solid lines denote light quarks , whereas solid and curly lines denote heavy quarks and gluons , respectively .",
    "note that we use the background field method for the external gluon.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    to calculate the chromomagnetic moment we have to consider the quark  anti - quark  gluon vertex in the background - field formalism in qcd .",
    "we consider the effect of a nonzero light quark mass at the three - loop level to this quantity .",
    "sample diagrams which have to be calculated are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig::diag ] .",
    "when both the quark and anti - quark are on the ( renormalised ) mass shell and have physical polarisations , the vertex @xmath1 can be decomposed into two form factors , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gluon momentum and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the momenta of the quark and anti - quark , respectively .",
    "the anomalous chromomagnetic moment is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the quark wave function renormalisation constant in the on - shell scheme .",
    "the total quark colour charge is given by @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath9 is the inverse of the on - shell wave function renormalisation constant , which has been calculated to three - loops including light quark masses in ref .",
    "therefore , the calculation of @xmath9 provides a strong check on the correctness of our result .",
    "all feynman diagrams are generated with qgraf  @xcite and the various topologies are identified with the help of q2e and exp  @xcite . in a next step the reduction of the various functions to so - called master integrals has to be achieved .",
    "for this step we use the so - called laporta method  @xcite which reduces the three - loop integrals to 27 master integrals .",
    "we use the implementation of laporta s algorithm in the program crusher  @xcite .",
    "it is written in c++ and uses ginac  @xcite for simple manipulations like taking derivatives of polynomial quantities . in the practical implementation of the laporta algorithm one of the most time - consuming operations",
    "is the simplification of the coefficients appearing in front of the individual integrals .",
    "this task is performed with the help of fermat  @xcite where a special interface has been used ( see ref .",
    "the main features of the implementation are the automated generation of the integration - by - parts ( ibp ) identities  @xcite , a complete symmetrisation of the diagrams and the possibility to make use of a multiprocessor environment . as we need the form factors at zero momentum transfer all occurring master integrals are on - shell propagator - type integrals .",
    "they have been calculated using different analytical and numerical methods , see refs .",
