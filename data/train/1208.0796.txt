    "supersymmetry is expected to be one of the key ingredients to describe physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "while tree - level supersymmetry breaking within the sm sector leads to light sfermions , the breaking sector is separated from the sm one and is mediated by some effective operators or quantum effects . among various mechanisms for realizing this scenario ,",
    "the gauge mediation , relevant to this paper , is one of the most promising candidates with a strong prophetic power ( for a review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that pseudomoduli directions are present in the supersymmetry - breaking vacuum of oraifeartaigh - like models with the canonical khler potential  @xcite .",
    "an important implication of this result is that , if such models are used as the hidden sector of gauge mediation , gaugino masses are generally suppressed or the vacuum is unstable somewhere along the pseudomoduli  @xcite .",
    "there have been various ways in the literature to avoid such a phenomenologically unfavorable situation , such as including nonminimal terms in the potential  @xcite , quantum effects from specific scalar and/or vector multiplets  @xcite , or accepting metastable vacua  @xcite .",
    "another way , as we discussed before , is to introduce gauge multiplets and take non - negligible d term into account for making the vacuum stable without pseudomoduli .    in our previous paper",
    ", we classified supersymmetry - breaking models with nonvanishing f and d terms  @xcite .",
    "first , the models are divided into two categories based on whether the f - term potential has a supersymmetric minimum ( at finite field configuration ) .",
    "we then add the d term by gauging flavor symmetry and analyze the vacuum of the full scalar potential in each category . for models that do not satisfy the f - flatness conditions , we found that the full potential generally shows runaway behavior . on the other hand , when the f - flatness conditions are satisfied , supersymmetry can be broken without pseudomoduli only in the presence of the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term . by using the latter class of models",
    ", we constructed a model of gauge mediation where gaugino masses are generated at the one - loop order .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss another possibility for the classification : the f - term potential is minimized at some infinite field configuration , i.e. , it shows a runaway behavior .",
    "it is found that the runaway direction of the f - term potential can be uplifted by the d term , and a supersymmetry - breaking vacuum emerges at finite field configuration .",
    "there are several reasons to explore this class of models in detail .",
    "first of all , contrary to our previous result , there is no need to add the fi term for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "secondly , the vacuum automatically suppresses pseudomoduli directions associated with the f - term potential , since it has a runaway behavior and is stabilized by the d - term potential .",
    "we propose a minimal model with such properties and couple it with an appropriate messenger sector . in this model",
    "including the messenger sector , r symmetry is spontaneously broken at the tree level even though the model contains chiral superfields with u(1)@xmath0 charge 0 or 2 only .",
    "we notice that r symmetry breaking does not occur for oraifeartaigh - like models with such a u(1)@xmath0 charge assignment @xcite .",
    "this class of supersymmetry breaking can therefore provide a realistic model for gauge mediation , where leading - order gaugino masses are obtained at the stable vacuum .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] , we briefly review our classification of f- and d - term supersymmetry breaking . in sec .",
    "[ sec : runaway ] , we discuss the case in which the f - term potential shows runaway behaviors .",
    "after some general arguments , a minimal model is presented to realize the vacuum property listed above .",
    "further , appropriate messenger sectors are discussed and shown to be viable for generating gaugino masses .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to summarizing our results and discussions on future directions . in the appendix",
    ", we show the potential analysis of the model given in sec .",
    "[ sec : runaway ] .",
    "we first review our previous result of the classification of supersymmetry breaking with both f and ( abelian ) d terms  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume the khler potential is canonical .",
    "the superpotential @xmath1 has a polynomial form of chiral superfields @xmath2 with u(1 ) charges @xmath3 ( the latin indices label their species ) .",
    "the scalar potential @xmath4 is then given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the contributions from f and d terms : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the u(1 ) gauge coupling constant and @xmath10 is the coefficient of the possible fayet - iliopoulos term  @xcite . in the following , we abbreviate field derivatives of the superpotential as @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we first divide models into two categories .",
    "the criterion for the classification is whether the f - flatness condition , @xmath13 , is satisfied or not at its minimum defined by @xmath14 .",
    "if the f - flatness condition is ( not ) satisfied , a model is called in the second ( first ) class .",
    "we then add the u(1 ) d term and analyze the tree - level behavior of the full scalar potential .",
    "for the first class of models , the scalar potential shows supersymmetric runaway behaviors when the d - term contribution is included .",
    "for the second class of models , on the other hand , supersymmetry can be broken without any pseudomoduli .",
    "that is , however , realized only in the presence of the fi term .",

    "we here comment on the role of each term in the superpotential  : the first and second terms make the origin unstable along the meson @xmath22 .",
    "the third term lifts up the @xmath23 direction , and naively supersymmetry is broken with the f - term potential coming from the first three terms .",
    "however , the potential minimum is found to run away to infinity of the moduli space along the @xmath24 direction ( with a finite value of @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is further noticed that anomaly cancellation requires the existence of a negatively charged field ( @xmath17 ) . without the last fourth term ,",
    "the value of @xmath17 is free and the direction @xmath25 becomes d flat , along which the potential minimum goes to infinity and supersymmetry is recovered . in this way , the superpotential is regarded as minimal one for the present purpose .    the scalar potential @xmath26 is explicitly given by @xmath27    & & v_d \\,=\\ , \\frac{g^2}{2}d^2 \\,=\\ ,    \\frac{g^2}{2}\\big(|x_+|^2+|\\varphi_+|^2-|x_-|^2-|\\varphi_-|^2\\big)^2 \\ , .",

    "we find along the following direction @xmath28 and all the f terms vanish except for the positively charged field @xmath29 , @xmath30 the runaway direction is parametrized by @xmath31 .",
    "as @xmath32 , the positively charged field @xmath24 goes to infinity and the f - term potential ( @xmath29 ) approaches to zero .",
    "furthermore , no u(1)@xmath0 runaway is expected since all the scalar fields in the present model have r charges 0 or 2  @xcite .",
    "it is easily seen that the f - term runaway direction is stabilized by the d - term contribution because , along this direction , the d term increases as @xmath33 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : uplift ] . )",
    "we again note that even when the runaway is lifted by the d term , it does not necessarily mean that the vacuum of the scalar potential is in the direction  .",

    "is uplifted by the d - term contribution @xmath7.,width=245 ]      we then analyze the scalar potential in detail to confirm that a stable supersymmetry - breaking vacuum is obtained in some parameter region .",
    "the parameters appearing in the superpotential are assumed to be real and positive without loss of generality .",
    "the vacuum is identified by solving the stationary conditions for the full scalar potential @xmath4 .",
    "a trivial configuration satisfying the stationary conditions is the origin at which all the scalar fields vanish .",
    "this point however is unstable and we do not consider it in the following . by some calculation",
    "( the detail is summarized in the appendix ) , we can show that the vacuum satisfies @xmath34 where several f terms vanish ; @xmath35 then the stationary conditions for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath16 automatically hold , and the scalar potential simplifies to @xmath38 with @xmath39 .  with this reduced potential ,",
    "the stationary condition for @xmath17 reads @xmath40 indicating @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "we discuss these two cases separately below , solving the remaining stationary conditions for @xmath43 .    : in this case , for a large mass ( @xmath44 ) or a small one ( @xmath45 ) , we can approximately write down the analytic solution to the stationary conditions for @xmath43 . for the large mass regime ,",
    "the solution is given by @xmath46 where the f and d components other than become @xmath47 at the leading order .",
    "therefore , the scalar potential is dominated by @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 . on the other hand , for the small mass regime , we have @xmath50 where the f and d components are @xmath51 and the scalar potential is found to be dominated by @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "notice that , in both regimes of @xmath53 , the r symmetry is unbroken as @xmath54 .",
    "the stability of these vacua is read off from the eigenvalues of the squared mass matrix for the scalar fields .",
    "we find that all eigenvalues except for @xmath17 are positive semidefinite . along the @xmath17 direction ,",
    "the eigenvalue is given by @xmath55 this eigenvalue is positive when @xmath56 for the large mass regime and @xmath57 for the small mass regime .",
    "therefore the supersymmetry - breaking vacuum realized is stable for these parameters .",
    "otherwise , @xmath58 is a saddle point and the true vacuum is given by the following second case :    : in this case , the stationary conditions are complicated and we only present a typical numerical solution .",
    "for example , when the model parameters are set as @xmath59 , which do not satisfy the above condition for the stability of @xmath58 , the vacuum is located at @xmath60 where nonvanishing f and d components are @xmath61 all the f and d terms become comparable to each other and contribute to the scalar potential @xmath62 .",
    "the stability of this vacuum is confirmed numerically .",
    "we have also checked that , for a wider parameter region , the scalar potential has a similar behavior . in fig .",

    "( for the @xmath66 case ) .",
    "the other parameters are fixed to @xmath67 . in the limit @xmath68 ,",
    "supersymmetry is recovered , but some expectation values run away to infinity.,width=245 ]    as @xmath64 becomes larger , @xmath17 is stabilized for @xmath56 and the vacuum is shifted up to , where @xmath69 .",
    "we then discuss the gauge - mediation scenario by employing the above model as a supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "appropriate messenger fields and their superpotential are identified for generating one - loop - order gaugino masses for the two cases , @xmath58 and @xmath66 , separately .    :",
    "as we have shown , the f and d terms have different behaviors depending of whether the mass parameter @xmath53 is large or small . for the large @xmath53 case , ,",
    "the supersymmetry - breaking scale is governed by @xmath48 from which sfermions are expected to receive soft masses . for generating a similar size of gaugino masses ,",
    "a simple way is to introduce the messenger fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 which are vectorlike under the sm gauge symmetry and have the superpotential , @xmath72 for @xmath73 , the standard one - loop diagram of messenger fields generates a gaugino mass @xmath74 ; @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the sm gauge coupling , and @xmath77 is the dynkin index of the sm gauge symmetry for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the gaugino mass is given at the vacuum discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is , however , noticed that the r symmetry is softly broken by the parameter @xmath78 that makes @xmath79 a local minimum .",
    "another way of obtaining gaugino masses would be to consider the direct gauge mediation , i.e. , to generalize u(1 ) to non - abelian symmetry containing the sm one . by adding a small supersymmetric mass for @xmath43 , they behave as messengers and",
    "would induce the sm gaugino masses without introducing additional multiplets .    for the small mass case ,",
    ", the charged f term @xmath29 dominates the supersymmetry - breaking scale . to split messenger masses with @xmath29",
    ", we must introduce two pairs of vectorlike messengers with u(1 ) charges @xmath80 and @xmath81 and couple them with @xmath36 in the superpotential . for further details of the messenger sector , the stability of the vacuum , and gaugino mass generation , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    : in the vacuum , the u(1)@xmath0 symmetry given in table [ table : assign ] is broken by the f term of @xmath16 which is neutral under both u(1 ) and u(1)@xmath0 .",
    "we consider the following messenger superpotential @xmath82 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are vectorlike multiplets , charged under the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "it is noticed that the @xmath20 symmetry is softly broken in this messenger sector .",
    "note that the superpotential ( [ example_superpotential ] ) has an anomalous u(1) symmetry , under which @xmath16 and @xmath17 are charged , but it is explicitly broken in ( [ messenger ] ) .",
    "the r symmetry is spontaneously broken in the full potential with both ( [ example_superpotential ] ) and ( [ messenger ] ) , if the vacuum in the previous section is stable .",
    "the vacuum stability is ensured by taking the parameter @xmath78 sufficiently large .",
    "the gaugino mass is evaluated for @xmath83 as @xmath84 which comes from a one - loop diagram , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 circulate in the loop .    from these observations , we conclude that this class of supersymmetry - breaking models is useful to build a simple , realistic hidden sector of gauge mediation .",
    "we have studied supersymmetry - breaking models with both f and d terms being nonvanishing . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on the case that the f - term potential shows runaway behaviors that originate from symmetries of theory considered .",
    "the runaway directions are uplifted by the d term and a supersymmetry - breaking vacuum is realized at finite field configuration .",
    "an interesting property of this approach is that ( phenomenologically disfavored ) pseudomoduli are absent in the vacuum since they are related to the minimization of the f - term potential .",
    "moreover , there is no need to add the fi term for supersymmetry breaking . along this line",
    ", a minimal renormalizable model has been presented where supersymmetry is broken . for an application to gauge mediation ,",
    "we have introduced appropriate messenger sectors and confirmed that r symmetry is spontaneously broken , and gaugino masses in the visible sector are generated at the comparable order of sfermion masses .",
    "this class of models may open up a new way to build realistic models of gauge mediation , circumventing the lemma proved by komargodski and shih  @xcite .",
    "as remarked , the d - term lifted runaway might be destabilized along other orthogonal directions such as the u(1)@xmath0 runaway .",
    "we do not have any criteria to ensure that the d - term uplifting of runaway directions can lead to the stable and global minimum of the scalar potential .",
