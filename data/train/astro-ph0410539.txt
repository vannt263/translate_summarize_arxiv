    "smc x-1 is a luminous accretion - powered high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxrb ) with a b0 i primary and a rapid spinning pulsar ( 0.71 sec ) in a 3.89-day period ( wojdowski et al .",
    "fuse observed smc x-1 for almost an entire 3.89 day orbital period in 2003 july .",
    "a total of 71 exposures ( 148 ksec ) were obtained over 3.4 days , covering phase 0.20 , through x - ray source conjunction ( @xmath0 ) , and primary eclipse ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the exposures were divided into nine phase bins , each with @xmath2 ksec and s / n@xmath3 per 0.05  .",
    "the ovi 1032 stellar wind line profile was corrected for milky way and smc interstellar h@xmath4 and ovi 1032 absorption by simultaneously modelling the ism lines in all nine spectra .",
    "the resulting ism model was subtracted from the observed ovi 1032 line at each phase ( see figure 1a for examples ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the ovi line was measured after the ism correction .",
    "figure 1b shows the strong variation of the ovi equivalent width with orbital phase .",
    "the orbital modulation of ovi in the stellar wind , the hm effect , is a result of ionization of the wind by the x - ray source .",
    "the large x - ray luminosity of smc x-1 ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) ionizes much of the wind and leaves a large stromgren zone .",
    "this disrupts the resonance - line acceleration of the wind in portions of the orbit , quencing the wind and disrupting the mass flow .",
    "the ovi wind absorption is strongly asymmetric around the orbit .",
    "the line is at maximum strength during the eclipse of the pulsar @xmath7 0.0 .",
    "the ovi line virtually disappears near @xmath8 .",
    "the ovi 1032 column density during eclipse is @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the ovi terminal velocity ( @xmath11700 km / s ) drops to near zero at @xmath7 0.3 - 0.4 .",
    "4u1700 - 37 has an o6.5 iaf primary in a 3.451 day orbital period with a neutron star or black hole secondary . the system is believed to have escaped from sco ob i about 2.5 million years ago .",
    "most recent mass estimates by clark et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who found @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "no x - ray /radio pulses or other periodicities are known , however rxte asm and cgro batse data show evidence of a 13.8 day periodicity .",
    "( hong & hailey , 2004 ) .",
    "4u1700 - 37 has been observed by fuse at the four quadrature points of the binary orbit in 2003 april and august and the hm effect ( hatchett & mccray 1977 ) has been observed for the first time in this system , 27 years after its prediction .",
    "the hm effect was predicted for 4u17000 - 37/hd153919 , but was not detected in nv 1240 , siiv 1400 , or civ 1550 in iue and hst data . the pv 1118 - 1128 and siv 1063 - 1073",
    "p- cygni lines are weakest at @xmath14 ( x - ray source conjuction ) and strongest at @xmath15 for the red wing and at @xmath16 for the blue wing ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the ovi and svi wind lines show orbital modulation different from pv and siv and are strongest at @xmath14 and weakest at @xmath16 ( x - ray source eclipse ) , implying that ovi and svi are byproducts of the wind s ionization by the x - ray source .",
    "such variations were not observed in nv , siiv and civ because of their high optical depth .",
    "the pv and siv transitions , on the other hand , are excellent tracers of the ionization conditions in the o star s wind .",
    "pv is the dominant ionization stage in the wind and has lower cosmic abundance than c , n or si . there is very little change in the terminal velocity ( @xmath17 km / sec ) of the wind with phase ."
