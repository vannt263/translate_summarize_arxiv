    "electromagnetic waves carry both energy and information .",
    "information is modulated on the amplitude and phase of an electromagnetic wave , while energy transfer is realized via either near - field induction or far - field radiation .",
    "applications of wireless energy transfer include passive radio - frequency identification ( rfid ) @xcite , body area networks @xcite , and power beaming using microwaves or laser from satellites or aircraft @xcite .",
    "recent research has recognized that the two tasks of energy and information pose conflicting constraints on the design of a wireless system @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this can be easily understood by noting that the power of a signal depends on its average squared value , while the quantity of information depends on the amount of `` variations '' , or more specifically on the entropy rate , of the signal itself  maximizing one generally does not lead to a maximum of the other .",
    "previous work @xcite-@xcite has focused on _ point - to - point _ _ _ or _ _ _ broadcast _ systems , and specifically on the problem of maximizing the information rate subject to minimum received energy constraints .",
    "reference @xcite studied a single point - to - point channel , @xcite investigated a set of parallel point - to - point channels and @xcite considered a multi - antenna broadcast channel .",
    "it was shown that , as the argument above suggests , the design of the optimal transmission strategy depends drastically on the received requirements .",
    "incidentally , we note that the setting at hand leads to very different insights with respect to the problem of maximizing the information rate subject to _ maximum _ received energy constraints considered in @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the model considered in @xcite is different in that it assumes that energy can be transferred between two nodes via a separate channel devoted to energy transfer .    while previous work focused on systems with a single transmitter , in this letter",
    "we take a first look at systems with multiple transmitters by focusing on the two baseline scenarios of _ multiple access channels _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) and _ multi - hop channels _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the main aim of this study is to argue that novel forms of coordination among distributed transmitters of a wireless networks become useful when the system design has to account for energy transfer requirements .",
    "more specifically , our contributions are as follows .    * * multiple access channel with received energy constraint : * in sec .",
    "[ sec : multiple - access - channel ] , we consider the standard multiple access channel in fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] with the additional constraint that the energy received by the decoder be large enough .",
    "first , the characterization of all the achievable trade - off among rate pairs and received energy is obtained , extending the point - to - point result of @xcite .",
    "then , an example is provided that demonstrates the enhanced need for coordination between the two encoders in order to satisfy the requirement on energy transfer ; * * multi - hop channel with a harvesting relay : * in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi - hop - channel - with ] , we turn our attention to the multi - hop channel in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , where the relay is assumed to be able to harvest the energy received from the encoder for transmission to the decoder .",
    "a characterization of the capacity is derived .",
    "an example is then described that illustrates the novel issues that arise in the design of the communication strategy in the first hop due to the harvesting capabilities for transmission over the second hop .",
    "in this section , we consider a discrete memoryless multiple access channel ( dm - mac ) ( @xmath0 in which two encoders wish to communicate independent messages to the decoder and at the same time , to provide the latter with sufficient received energy ( see fig . [",

    "[ sub : example :- gaussian - mac ] . ]      in order to illustrate the novel aspects in the system design that are entailed by the minimum receive energy constraint ( [ eq : bbound ] ) , we now consider the gaussian mac @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the additive noise .",

    "as it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , without any constraint on the received energy , the maximum sum - rate is given as @xmath51 which is achieved by setting @xmath36 to a constant and @xmath52 for @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , _ maximum information transfer does not require time sharing_. moreover , with this choice , the received power is @xmath53=2p+1 $ ] .",

    "it is seen that , as the received energy constraint @xmath30 becomes large enough ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) , _ time - sharing is necessary to achieve the optimal performance_. this demonstrates that additional coordination is generally needed between the encoders in order to obtain the desired trade - off between information and energy transfer .",
