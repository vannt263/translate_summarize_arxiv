    "let @xmath0 be a compact ( complex ) khler manifold .",
    "it should be considered as phase space manifold @xmath1 with symplectic form given by the khler form @xmath2 .",
    "note that by the assumed compactness the `` free phase space '' is not included here .",
    "nevertheless there exist important examples of such compact situations .",
    "e.g.  they could appear as phase space manifolds for certain constrained systems and they could appear after dividing out certain symmetry group action in a noncompact situation .",
    "they also play a role in the quantization of 2-dimensional conformal field theory . here",
    "the space which has to be quantized is the compactified moduli space of stable holomorphic vector bundles ( with additional structures ) on a riemann surface .",
    "using the khler form one can assign to every differentiable function @xmath3 its hamiltonian vector field @xmath4 and to every pair of functions @xmath3 and @xmath5 its poisson bracket : @xmath6 with the poisson bracket the algebra of differentiable functions @xmath7 becomes a poisson algebra @xmath8 .",
    "assume @xmath9 to be quantizable .",
    "this says there exists an associated quantum line bundle @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is a holomorphic line bundle , @xmath12 a hermitian metric on @xmath11 and @xmath13 a connection compatible with the complex structure and the hermitian metric . with respect to a local complex",
    "coordinate patch and a local holomorphic frame of the bundle the metric @xmath12 is given by a function @xmath14 and the connection as ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16 the quantization condition says that the curvature @xmath17 of the line bundle and the khler form @xmath2 of the manifold are related as @xmath18 } = -\\i\\w(x , y)\\ .\\ ] ] in terms of the metric @xmath12 this can be written as @xmath19 .",
    "the quantization condition implies that @xmath11 is a positive ( or ample ) line bundle . by the kodaira embedding theorem",
    "a certain tensor power of @xmath11 is very ample , i.e. its global sections can be used to embed the phase space manifold @xmath1 into projective space ( with dimension given by the riemann - roch formula ) .",
    "hence , quantizable compact khler manifolds are projective algebraic manifolds ( and vice versa , see below ) .    the riemann sphere , the complex projective line , @xmath20 .",
    "with respect to the quasi - global coordinate @xmath21 the form @xmath2 can be given as @xmath22 the quantum line bundle @xmath11 is the hyperplane bundle .",
    "for the poisson bracket one obtains @xmath23    the ( complex- ) one dimensional torus @xmath1 . up to isomorphy it can be given as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a lattice with @xmath26 .",
    "as khler form we take @xmath27 with respect to the coordinate @xmath21 on the covering space @xmath28 . the corresponding quantum line bundle is the theta line bundle of degree 1 , i.e. the bundle whose global sections are the scalar multiples of the riemann theta function .    the complex projective space @xmath29 with the fubini - study fundamental form as khler form .",
    "the associated quantum bundle is the hyperplane bundle . by restricting the form and the bundle on complex submanifolds ( which are automatically algebraic ) all projective manifolds are quantizable . as remarked above every quantizable compact khler manifold",
    "is projective .",
    "nevertheless the embedding into projective space does not necessarily respect the khler form .    for the space of ( arbitrary ) global sections of @xmath11 a scalar product",
    "is defined by @xmath30",
    "let @xmath31 be the ( infinite - dimensional ) space of global differentiable sections of the line bundle @xmath11 , @xmath32 its l@xmath33-completion with respect to the scalar product ( [ lsca ] ) , and @xmath34 the finite - dimensional subspace of global holomorphic sections .",
    "denote by @xmath35 the projection . the toeplitz operator associated to the function @xmath36 is defined as the composition @xmath37 here",
    "@xmath38 denotes the multiplication of the sections by the function @xmath3 .    due to the finite - dimensionality of @xmath34 information",
    "gets lost . to recover this information we have to do everything for each tensor power @xmath39 of @xmath11 .",
    "this gives us @xmath40 and the toeplitz operators @xmath41 .",
    "the assignment @xmath42 is called _  quantization _",
    "( of level @xmath43 ) .",
    "the theorems below will justify the use of the term `` quantization '' .",
    "if one switches to the notation @xmath44 then the limit @xmath45 corresponds to @xmath46 as `` classical limit '' .    by a result of tuynman @xcite",
    "suitable reinterpreted ( see @xcite for a coordinate independent proof ) one obtains the relation @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the more well - known operator of geometric quantization with respect to the prequantum operator @xmath49 and with khler polarization .    in the example of 2-dimensional conformal field theory mentioned at the beginning , there exists a natural quantum line bundle @xmath11 .",
    "the spaces @xmath50 are the _",
    "verlinde spaces_.    assume @xmath11 to be already very ample . by a rescaling of the khler form",
    "this always can be achieved .",
    "the following two theorems are proved in a joint paper with m. bordemann and e. meinrenken @xcite .    for every @xmath51 we have @xmath52 and @xmath53 here",
    "@xmath54 is the sup - norm of @xmath55 on @xmath1 and @xmath56 is the operator norm with respect to the scalar product ( [ lsca ] ) on @xmath50 .",
    "for every @xmath57 we have @xmath58    by interpreting @xmath59 as @xmath60 we see that up to order @xmath61 the quantization prescription _",
    "`` replace the classical poisson bracket by the ( rescaled ) commutator of the operators '' _ is fulfilled .",
    "we obtain an approximative operator representation .",
    "by a refinement of the methods for the proofs of the above theorems it is possible to construct a star product , resp . a deformation quantization for @xmath8 .",
    "let me recall the definition of a star product .",
    "let @xmath62 $ ] be the algebra of formal power series in the variable @xmath60 over the algebra @xmath7 .",
    "a product @xmath63 on @xmath64 is called a ( formal ) star product if it is an associative @xmath65$]-linear product such that    1 .",
    "@xmath66 , i.e.@xmath67 , 2 .",
    "@xmath68 .    we can always write @xmath69 the conditions 1 . and 2 .",
    "can be reformulated as @xmath70    there exists a unique ( formal ) star product on @xmath7 @xmath71 in such a way that for @xmath72 and for every @xmath73 we have @xmath74 for @xmath45 , with suitable constants @xmath75 .",
    "again this is joint work with m. bordemann and e. meinrenken .",
    "the proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "also , it will appear in a forthcoming paper .",
    "time and space does not permit me to give even a rough sketch of the proof .",
    "let me only point out the following steps .",
    "we use the embedding of @xmath1 via the sections of @xmath11 ( which is now assumed to be very ample ) into projective space . for the embedded situation we have an associated toeplitz structure , the generalized toeplitz operators ( of arbitrary orders ) and their symbol calculus as introduced by boutet de monvel and guillemin @xcite .",
    "the above defined @xmath76 can be considered as the `` modes '' ( with respect to an @xmath77-action ) of a global toeplitz operator @xmath78 .",
    "the symbol calculus gives bounds for their norms .    with the help of the above theorems it is possible to show @xcite the conjecture of bordemann , hoppe , schaller and schlichenmaier @xcite that for quantizable khler manifolds",
    "the poisson algebra is an @xmath79 , @xmath80 quasi - limit with a strictly increasing integer valued function @xmath81 given by the riemann - roch formula . for the definition of quasi - limits",
