    "a fundamental idea behind classical statistical mechanics is that we are living in a macroscopic world , which means that we are unable to deal with microstates on a molecular level .",
    "this forces us to distinguish heat from work and to accept the increase of entropy on probabilistic ground , when we formulate the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "however , the border between our macroscopic world and the microscopic world of molecules is becoming vague due to technological developments over the last century .",
    "this has led to a natural question ; i.e. , what would it mean to thermodynamics if it became possible to access and manipulate microstates just as we do macrostates ?",
    "the founders of statistical mechanics were already aware of this problem : for example , maxwell imagined an intelligent being s intervention on a molecular level in his famous thought experiment , now known as maxwell s demon  @xcite , and expressed deep concern about the foundation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the szilard engine has been regarded as the simplest implementation of maxwell s demon with a single - particle gas  @xcite .",
    "its cycle consists of four processes ; inserting a wall into the center of the box , measuring the position of the particle , expanding the quantum gas isothermally , and finally removing the wall . considering its microscopic nature , it is tempting to translate the cycle into quantum - mechanical language as has been done in refs .   and for other engines .",
    "in fact , there are more reasons than that : zurek  @xcite , when he discusses jauch and baron s objection that the gas is compressed without the expenditure of energy upon inserting the wall , argues that one has to resort to quantum mechanics to understand the szilard engine  @xcite . according to ref .",
    ", this ` apparent inconsistency ' is removed by quantum - mechanical considerations .",
    "therefore , in a sense , it is a matter of theoretical consistency .",
    "kim and coworkers have presented a detailed account for its quantum - mechanical cycle in refs .  , with emphasis on the isothermal process .",
    "there seem to remain some subtle issues to settle , however , as shown in the debate on how to deal with the quantum tunneling effect through the wall in a three - boson case  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we describe the isothermal expansion of the quantum szilard engine by considering a quantum gas confined in a one - dimensional cylinder  @xcite .",
    "although some previous studies , such as refs .  , assume that the wall is impenetrable , we will relax that assumption because it is , strictly speaking , experimentally infeasible .",
    "starting from the schrdinger equation , we calculate the energy levels and thereby obtain how much work can be extracted by an isothermal reversible expansion .",
    "we find the following : the amount of reversible work is significantly reduced compared to the claims in refs .   and",
    "if we assume full thermal equilibrium inside the box , as is usual in describing isothermal expansion .",
    "this conclusion should not be affected by either the wall s insertion or the measurement before the isothermal expansion because thermal equilibrium does not remember its history . moreover ,",
    "if we put two or three fermions in the box , the free - energy landscape is not monotonic with respect to the wall s position , so that we should sometimes _ perform _ work to expand the gas .",
    "these effects have not been explicitly discussed in previous studies .",
    "this work is organized as follows : an explanation of our basic setting in terms of the schrdinger equation is given in section  [ sec : isoexp ] . a numeric calculation of the energy levels and the free energy and a comparison of a single - particle case to the two- and three - particle cases is presented in in section  [ sec : work ] .",
    "this is followed by discussion of results and conclusions .",
    "consider the following one - dimensional potential landscape with size @xmath0 : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the strength of the delta potential and @xmath3 specifies its location  @xcite .",
    "we expect the schrdinger equation @xmath4 \\psi(x ) = e \\psi(x ) \\label{eq : schrod}\\ ] ] to have a solution with a sinusoidal form .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath5 and @xmath6 are satisfied if we set @xmath7 where the coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as well as the wavenumber @xmath10 , are assumed to be nonzero .",
    "the eigenfunction @xmath11 has the following properties : first , it is continuous over @xmath12 $ ] ; i.e. , @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "second , the change in the derivative of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath15 around @xmath16 is obtained by using @xmath17 dx + \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2 } \\left [ \\int_{pl-\\epsilon}^{pl+\\epsilon } e \\psi(x ) dx - \\int_{pl-\\epsilon}^{pl+\\epsilon } a \\psi(x ) \\delta(x - pl ) dx \\right ] \\right\\ } = 0,\\ ] ] from which it follows that @xmath18 plugging eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) here and multiplying both sides by @xmath19 to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont ] ) , we obtain @xmath20 this formula has also been derived in ref .   in a different way .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : k ] ) can be numerically solved by using the newton - raphson method to yield the allowed values of @xmath10 .",
    "the method works as follows : first , let us define @xmath21 , and look for its zeros to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "starting from @xmath22 , we check whether the sign of @xmath23 changes with increasing @xmath10 by a sufficiently small amount , say , @xmath24 . every time the sign changes between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we run the following iteration starting from @xmath27 : @xmath28}{f'[k^{(j)}]},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 . when @xmath30 has converged to a stationary value @xmath31 , i.e. , if @xmath32 within numerical accuracy , we take it as a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) and repeat the procedure by checking the sign of @xmath23 from @xmath33 .",
    "each of these solutions is identified with the wavenumber @xmath34 of the @xmath35th eigenmode in an ascending order . for the application of the newton - raphson method numerically , it is convenient to express the quantities in dimensionless units , so we divide eq .",

    "we are interested in how much work can be extracted by performing a reversible isothermal process with this system .",

    "the classical concepts , such as pressure and work , need careful consideration in quantum mechanics  @xcite . to calculate work ,",

    "the quantum thermodynamic work is identified with @xmath69 because heat is usually involved with changes in occupation probabilities for given energy levels whereas work is performed when the energy levels themselves change  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the amount of reversible work during this process is @xmath70 , which is consistent with the classical case .     in units of @xmath48",

    "suppose that @xmath72 is so low that @xmath76 .",
    "when the wall is at @xmath77 , only the ground state contributes to the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) , which means that @xmath78 .",
    "when the wall is at @xmath49 , the ground - state energy equals @xmath79 , and the first excited state also contributes to the partition sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) because it lies close to the ground state [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : level5](b ) ] .",
    "the partition function is , therefore , approximated as @xmath80 .",
    "the free - energy difference in this low-@xmath72 region is , thus , given as @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath82 , for example , the free - energy difference roughly amounts to @xmath83 , which explains the size of the free - energy drop in fig .",
    "[ fig : df ] .",
    "as @xmath72 increases , a plateau develops near the center of the box because @xmath84 does not respond much to the wall s position",
    ". however , the drop in @xmath84 at the end of the process increases with increasing @xmath72 if @xmath85 in units of @xmath86 .",
    "our question is how it grows with @xmath72 .",
    "let us take @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "then , it is the partition function for the initial and final wall positions can be approximated .",
    "the latter case of the final wall position is estimated as @xmath89\\label{eq : correction}\\\\ & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4\\gamma } } - \\frac{1}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correction ] ) is a first - order correction to the integral approximation .",
    "likewise , the former case of the initial wall position gives @xmath90 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4\\gamma } } - 1,\\ ] ] where the factor of @xmath91 in front of the summation is due to the fact that every pair of adjacent energy levels becomes degenerate in the limit of @xmath87 .",
    "this effect cancels the factor of @xmath92 inside the exponential arising from the reduced volume @xmath93 .",
    "although @xmath75 does not completely vanish due to the correction , the important point is that @xmath94 for @xmath95 is far less than @xmath91 , in contrast with the claim that @xmath96 in refs .   and .",
    "because @xmath97 must be finite in any experimental situation , the particle can , in full thermal equilibrium , be observed on either side of the box , which reduces the amount of extracted work . on the other hand ,",
    "the previous studies on the quantum szilard engine  @xcite have assumed that the process is performed within a shorter time scale than required for tunneling through the wall and , therefore , concluded that @xmath98 without the factor of @xmath91 in front .",
    "strictly speaking , their engine undergoes an isothermal process only when partially equilibrated to maintain the confinement and extract @xmath99 .",
    "if two quantum particles are in the box , we should consider their symmetry , i.e. , whether they are fermions or bosons . without any consideration of the spin degree of freedom ,",
    "the elements of the density matrix for the two particles are expressed in the bracket notation as follows : @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the kronecker delta symbol , and we have a plus sign for bosons and a minus sign for fermions . the two - particle partition function",
    "is then obtained by taking the trace operation : @xmath102 the same applies to the three - particle case .",
    "the density - matrix elements are written as @xmath103 , and the partition function reads @xmath104    figure  [ fig : sym ] shows the free - energy differences for the two- and the three - particle cases .",
    "the bosonic cases are qualitatively similar to the single - particle case .",
    "however , we see very different behavior for the fermionic cases where the pauli exclusion principle is in action : at low @xmath72 , we need to perform positive work to move the wall from the center to a certain position @xmath47 [ figs .",
    "[ fig : sym](b ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "obviously , the reason is that it costs free energy to place two fermions close to each other .",
    "in summary , we have considered an isothermal expansion process of a quantum gas , taking the tunneling effect into consideration .",
    "we have found that the amount of reversible work is smaller than @xmath105 in the high-@xmath72 region if the system is fully equilibrated at every moment of the isothermal expansion .",
    "the difference from refs .   and arises because they have separated the time scale of tunneling from that of the partial equilibration that occurs on only one side of the wall .",
    "although it was not explicitly stated in previous studies , this separation may be a plausible assumption for the following reason : as we increase the potential height @xmath97 , we may well expect the time scale for tunneling to grow whereas the partial equilibration before tunneling is achieved within a finite amount of time .",
    "the quantum szilard engine will show its expected performance only between these two time scales .",
    "the question is , then , how large a value of @xmath97 one should have to ensure the separation of the time scales , which will be pursued in our future studies .",
