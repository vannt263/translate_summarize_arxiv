    "persistent currents are one of the striking phenomena associated to superfluidity . in charged systems , electric currents flowing without dissipation along superconductor loops are due to the superfluid flow of bose - condensed cooper pairs , and have found an extensive field of applications since the prediction of squids @xcite . in neutral systems , persistent currents",
    "have been observed since the early experiments with superfluid liquid helium ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) , and have experimented a revival with the advent of bose - einstein condensation of ultracold gases .",
    "multiply connected geometries have allowed the generation of long - life currents in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , paving the way for atomtronic devices .",
    "the effect of a rotating external potential producing a depletion in the density ( weak link ) has been theoretically and experimentally addressed in rings of ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "the rotating weak link drags the superfluid into a moving state once the resistance of the system to generate excitations has been overcome .",
    "whether superfluid excitations are triggered by reaching the speed of sound , according to landau criterion , or by vortex nucleation , following feynman criterion , has yet to be elucidated @xcite .",
    "experimental works ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) point out that vortices are responsible of the activation of persistent currents in a ring .",
    "phase slips seem to be originated by the transit of a vortices towards the inner ( outer ) edge of the system @xcite , producing the increase ( decrease ) up to one unit in the winding number .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a hysteresis loop has been observed in the generation of quantized persistent currents by means of a rotating weak link .",
    "a 3d ring of bose - condensed @xmath0na atoms was prepared in a stationary state with winding number @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , and the frequency @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) at which the winding number changes to @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) was measured .",
    "the size of the hysteresis loop , i.e. the difference @xmath5 , was compared with numerical results obtained by solving the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , showing a big discrepancy . as",
    "the intensity of the link decreases , the size of the loop becomes considerably smaller in the experiment than in the numerics .",
    "the reason adduced for the difference points to a dissipation mechanism , but a complete explanation has still not been given .",
    "hysteresis is a phenomenon intimately linked to systems presenting multiple local energy minima separated by energy barriers that must be overcome when driving the system from one minimum to the other @xcite .",
    "the final state depends on the path followed in the dynamical evolution searching for equilibrium states . for superfluids in a ring",
    ", it is well known that local energy minima correspond to states with different winding number @xcite . however ,",
    "neither the exact nature of the states lying on the barrier nor their stability have been shown yet , although it has been hypothesized that unstable states separate adjacent winding numbers .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate the existence of stationary states with non - quantized angular momentum in 3d rings .",
    "these states are solitary waves that fill the gap of angular momentum between winding numbers . among such solitonic states ,",
    "there exist dynamically stable configurations that can support long - life currents .",
    "in addition , we show how the rotating weak link provides common features of solitary waves to winding number states . in doing so",
    ", the size of hysteresis loops can be determined by the range of existence of solitary waves within the weak link region .",
    "solitonic states configure the energy barrier preventing phase slips and meet a family of winding number states when the barrier vanishes .",
    "this fact indicates that landau and feynman criteria may also match .",
    "the former stablishes that phase slips are produced when the fluid flow reaches the local speed of sound , at the end of a winding number family of stationary solutions .",
    "but this is also in agreement with feynman criterion , which states that phase slips appear when vortex lines can be excited inside the system , as it occurs at the end of a solitonic family of steady states .",

    "when rotation is introduced , opposite effects can be observed in solitonic and winding - phase states ( see fig .",

    "we have studied the generation of persistent currents by means of rotating weak links in 3d bose - einstein condensates confined in a torus .",
    "we demonstrate the existence of persistent currents with non - quantized angular momentum supported by stationary states that include solitary waves .",

    "we show that the energy barrier vanishes when the angular frequency makes such solitons to move at the local speed of sound . at this rotation rate ,",

    "@xcite is characterized by the convergence process between winding numbers and solitons .",
    "this connection allows to identify , at the end of the hysteresis loop , both stationary vortex lines ( making solitonic states ) , and phonons ( traveling at the speed of sound on winding number states ) .",
    "this fact indicates that feynman and landau criteria for the generation of phase slips meet at the connection point .",

    "<S> the barrier vanishes when the critical rotation leads winding numbers and solitonic states to a matching configuration . at this point , </S>",
    "<S> landau and feynman criteria for phase slips meet : the fluid flow reaches the local speed of sound , and stationary vortex lines ( which are the building blocks of solitons ) can be excited inside the system . </S>"
