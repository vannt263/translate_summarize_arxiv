    "( see ( * ? ? ? *",
    "introduction ) for a more detailed exposition for mathematicians . )",
    "seiberg - witten s ansatz roughly says that the @xmath1 susy gauge theory is controlled by a family of elliptic curves ( called seiberg - witten curves ) @xmath19 parametrized by @xmath20 .",
    "here @xmath21 is a formal variable used to count the dimension of instanton moduli spaces in the prepotential of the theory .",
    "( in the donaldson series , one usually sets @xmath22 . )",
    "witten explained that @xmath9 is given by an integration over @xmath23 , and the integrand is supported only at points @xmath24 , where the corresponding elliptic curve is singular , when @xmath4 .",
    "those points contribute as given on the right hand side of .    in mathematics ,",
    "the seiberg - witten curves appear as elliptic curves for the @xmath25-function in fintushel - stern s blow - up formula @xcite for donaldson invariants , and the parameter @xmath26 corresponds to the point class @xmath27 .",
    "however , no mathematician succeeded to make witten s argument rigorous .",
    "an alternative mathematically rigorous approach was proposed by pidstrigach and tyurin @xcite , and further pursued by feehan - leness @xcite .",
    "it is based on moduli spaces of @xmath28-monopoles , which are a higher rank analog of @xmath29-monopoles used to define seiberg - witten invariants . in particular , under a certain technical assumption on a property of @xmath28-monopole moduli spaces , feehan - leness @xcite ( see also @xcite , in particular ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) ) showed that donaldson invariants have the form @xmath30 where the coefficients @xmath31 are not explicit , but depend only on the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and various intersection products among @xmath15 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath36 is an auxiliary spin@xmath14 structure needed for @xmath28-monopole moduli spaces . as an application",
    ", they proved witten s conjecture for @xmath2 which satisfies @xmath37 or is abundant , i.e. , the orthogonal complement of seiberg - witten classes contains a hyperbolic sublattice @xcite .    for a complex projective surface",
    "@xmath2 , mochizuki , motivated by @xcite ( and also by @xcite ) , proved a formula expressing donaldson invariants in the form , but the coefficients @xmath31 are given as residue of an explicit @xmath38-equivariant integral over the product of hilbert schemes of points on @xmath2 ( see theorem  [ thm : mochizuki ] ) .",
    "he obtained the formula by applying the atiyah - bott - lefschetz fixed point formula to the algebro - geometric counterpart of @xmath28-monopole moduli spaces .    our first main result ( theorem  [ thm : partition ] ) says that mochizuki s coefficients are given by leading terms , denoted by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 of nekrasov s deformed partition function for the @xmath1 susy gauge theory with a single fundamental matter , which is the physics counterpart of the @xmath28-monopole theory .",
    "thus the coefficients are ` equivariant @xmath28-monopole invariants for @xmath43 ' in some sense .",
    "the proof is almost the same as that of the authors wall - crossing formula of donaldson invariants with @xmath44 , expressed in terms of nekrasov s partition function for the pure gauge theory @xcite : by a cobordism argument ( due to ellingsrud - gttsche - lehn @xcite ) , it is enough to show it for toric surfaces",
    ". then the integral is given as the product of local contributions from torus fixed points of @xmath2 , and the local contribution can be considered as the case @xmath45 .",
    "thus it is , by its definition , nekrasov s partition function .    from this result , we see that mochizuki s coefficients depend on the various data in the same way as those of feehan - leness . in particular , they make sense also for a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 .",
    "( here @xmath36 is given by the complex structure . )",
    "hoping that mochizuki s coefficients are the same as those of feehan - leness for our heuristic proof of this hope .",
    "this paper is motivated by feehan - leness papers , but the proof is independent . ] , we propose a conjecture : our formula remains true for a smooth @xmath0-manifold of sw - simple type ( conjecture  [ con : main ] ) .",
    "nekrasov s partition functions are defined in a mathematically rigorous way and have explicit combinatorial expressions in terms of young diagrams @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the leading part @xmath39 is given by certain period integrals over seiberg - witten curves @xcite , @xmath40 is explicit , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 are also given in terms of seiberg - witten curves @xcite .",
    "the proofs in @xcite were given only for the pure theory , but we extend them for the theory with one matter in this paper using the theory of perverse coherent sheaves @xcite .",
    "thus mochizuki s coefficients are now given by residue of a differential form expressed by seiberg - witten curves .",
    "the pole , at which we take the residue , is at @xmath46 .",
    "it is very deep pole , and a direct computation of the residue looks difficult .",
    "fortunately there is a hint : a similar problem , for certain limits of donaldson invariants with @xmath47 , was analyzed by gttsche - zagier @xcite . observing that their differential is defined on @xmath48 , holomorphic outside @xmath49 , @xmath50",
    ", they showed that it is enough to compute the residues at poles @xmath50 which are simple , and proved an analog of witten s conjecture .",
    "also this picture is close to witten s original intuition - plane integrand is a total derivative , at least if we take a derivative with respect to the metric",
    ". see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 11.16 ) ) ] .",
    "let us emphasize that the extension of the differential to @xmath48 is already a nontrivial assertion . in the original formulation",
    "the parameter @xmath26 was a _",
    "variable used to introduce a generating function of invariants .",
    "therefore it is , a priori , defined only in the formal neighborhood of @xmath46 .",
    "the extension is done , so far , by an explicit formula of the differential .",
    "thus the geometric picture of moduli spaces becomes obscure at the points @xmath50 .",
    "our situation is similar to one in @xcite , but slightly different .",
    "the seiberg - witten curve for the theory with a fundamental matter is @xmath51 and has one more parameter @xmath52 , called the _",
    "mass _ of the matter field . and in our formula",
    ", this @xmath52 is chosen so that the above curve is singular",
    ". therefore the family of curves is different from what witten used .",
    "we have two features of the new family .",
    "first since the curves are singular , the differential is written by elementary functions , not by modular functions as in @xcite .",
    "this makes our computation much easier .",
    "second , more importantly , we get another pole besides @xmath49 , @xmath50 , which is called the _ superconformal point _ in physics literature .",
    "( in the main text , we change the variable from @xmath26 to another variable @xmath53 called the _",
    "contact term_. )    the contribution of this point to the gauge theory with one matter was studied by mario , moore and peradze @xcite at a physical level of rigor .",
    "they argued that the partition function must be regular at the superconformal point and then this condition leads to sum rules on seiberg - witten invariants , i.e. , @xmath2 must satisfy the following condition .",
    "[ def : scs ] suppose that a @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 is of sw - simple type .",
    "we say @xmath2 is of _ superconformal simple type _ if @xmath37 or @xmath54 for any integral lift @xmath55 of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "remark that @xmath37 is the condition which feehan - leness @xcite assumed to prove witten s conjecture .",
    "it should be remarked that they also proved that @xmath2 is of superconformal simple type if @xmath2 is abundant under the same technical assumption as before @xcite .",
    "we analyze the residue of our differential at the superconformal point and show that 1 ) the fact that @xmath58 , up to sign , depends only on @xmath59 implies that @xmath2 is of superconformal simple type , and 2 ) the differential is regular at the superconformal point if @xmath2 is of superconformal simple type .",
    "thus the residue vanishes at the superconformal point , and hence we prove witten s conjecture for a @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 of simple type under conjecture  [ con : main ] , and under no assumption for a complex projective surface @xmath2 .",

    "the framework is essentially the same as the @xmath28-monopole cobordism program , except for a systematic usage of the obstruction theory .",

    "he applied this theory to the case of moduli spaces of rank @xmath87 pairs .",
    "when a stability condition is suitably chosen , moduli spaces of pairs are projective bundles over moduli of genuine sheaves , thus the invariants are reduced to donaldson invariants . on the other hand , for another stability condition , moduli spaces become the empty set .",

    "ours is just the negative of mochizuki s , as @xmath349 is in @xmath350 $ ] .",
    "\\(3 ) the factor @xmath351 in the left hand side comes from mochizuki s convention .",
    "he considered the integration over the moduli space of _ oriented _ sheaves .",
    "there is a natural tale proper morphism from the oriented moduli space to the usual one of degree @xmath352 .",
    "\\(4 ) the assumption is satisfied if we replace @xmath107 by @xmath353 for sufficiently large @xmath82 .",
    "but it is not clear , a priori , that the right hand side is independent of @xmath82 .",
    "this will become important for our later analysis of the residue of @xmath354 .",
    "\\(5 ) mochizuki denoted the usual seiberg - witten invariant by @xmath355 and set @xmath356 .",
    "we keep @xmath186 for the notation of the usual seiberg - witten invariant . on the other hand",
    ", the seiberg - witten class @xmath357 will naturally appears in the witten s formula .",
    "therefore we have denoted it by @xmath358 .",
    "thus our @xmath359 is mochizuki s @xmath360 .",
    "\\(6 ) since the expected dimension @xmath361 is @xmath362 , we have @xmath363    by riemann - roch , we have @xmath364      now we prove our first main result .",
    "recall @xmath314 .",
    "let us introduce the generating function of the @xmath365 : @xmath366    [ thm : partition ] we have @xmath367 ,    \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath368 as above , and the derivatives of @xmath369 , @xmath370 and @xmath371 are evaluated at @xmath372 .",
    "observe that our formula does not depend on the complex structure of @xmath2 when we consider the canonical class @xmath103 as a choice of a spin@xmath14 structure .",
    "therefore , the above expression makes sense for a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 .",
    "further observe that @xmath103 appears in the above expression only as either @xmath33 or the combination @xmath373 , except in the sign factor .",
    "we can do slightly more precise .",
    "the first sign factor @xmath102 comes from the difference between the complex orientation and the usual orientation as mentioned in ",
    "[ subsec : complex ] .",
    "the second factor @xmath374 can be also replaced by @xmath375 up to an expression involving only @xmath373 , @xmath33 .",
    "( see the discussion below . * * * * ) this @xmath375 already appears in witten s formula .",

    "the only requirement is that it is equal to @xmath377 in @xmath378",

    "we have the conditions @xmath344 , @xmath382 , which we do not know how to interpret for a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we just ignore this condition and conjecture that mochizuki s result holds without it .",
    "this conjecture is compatible with feehan - leness result .",
    "our formula in theorem  [ thm : partition ] involves only the intersection pairings among @xmath358 , @xmath373 and @xmath35 .",
    "their formula involves an auxiliary cohomology class , denoted by @xmath21 in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we take the canonical spin@xmath14 structure of the complex surface @xmath2 as @xmath36 , so their @xmath21 should be identified with our @xmath376 .",
    "in fact , @xmath21 satisfies the same condition which we have assumed for @xmath373 . it is required to satisfy the same condition as @xmath343 thanks to ( written as ` @xmath384 ' [ loc .",

    "we also remark that the exponent @xmath385 of @xmath386 is equal to @xmath387 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1.12 ) ) if we take @xmath388 , @xmath389 and replace @xmath33 by @xmath390 .",
    "thus our conjecture follows immediately if the coefficients @xmath31 appearing in feehan - leness formula are the same as ours .",
    "this does not directly follow from feehan - leness statement itself , as seiberg - witten invariants satisfy nontrivial relations , namely superconformal simple type condition , therefore the coefficients are not uniquely determined .",
    "the authors heuristic proof is the following : there is a morphism from mochizuki s master space to the moduli space of @xmath28-monopole when @xmath2 is complex projective .",
    "then by the functoriality of pushforward homomorphisms as used in , the contributions of seiberg - witten invariants are the same for mochizuki s and feehan - leness formulas .",
    "since feehan - leness formula is universal , it is enough to calculate them for complex projective @xmath2 , and our calculation gives the answer .",
    "this proof works only for @xmath2 of simple type and for which there is a complex projective surface @xmath391 with @xmath392 , @xmath393 . to generalize it for hypothetical @xmath2 of non - simple type , we need to connect feehan - leness coefficients with nekrasov partition function more directly .",
