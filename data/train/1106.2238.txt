    "in the present letter we address the problem of mismatch between kinetic and magnetic energies recently reported in observations of the solar wind turbulence .",
    "our interest is also motivated by a similar mismatch found in recent numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , suggesting that the phenomenon may , in fact , have a fundamental nature rather than reflect a possible non - universality of solar wind turbulence . by employing the framework of weak mhd turbulence we present the first direct analytical derivation of residual energy generation in mhd turbulence .",
    "we demonstrate that kinetic - magnetic equipartition gets spontaneously broken by interacting random alfvn waves , even if it is present initially .",
    "our results indicate that this effect plays a fundamental role in the energy cascade , and it should be taken into account in phenomenological modeling of mhd turbulence .    for our analysis we write the incompressible mhd equations in terms of the elsasser variables : @xmath5 where the elsasser variables are defined as @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the fluctuating plasma velocity , @xmath8 is the fluctuating magnetic field normalized by @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the alfvn velocity corresponding to the uniform magnetic field @xmath11 , @xmath12 includes the plasma pressure @xmath13 and the magnetic pressure , @xmath14 is the constant mass density , and we neglected the terms describing viscous and resistive dissipation .",
    "one observes that when @xmath15 , an arbitrary function @xmath16 is an exact solution of  ( [ mhd - elsasser ] ) , which represents a non - dispersive alfvn wave propagating parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath11 with the alfvn speed .",
    "nonlinear interactions are the result of collisions between counter - propagating alfvn wave packets .",
    "this qualitative picture plays a central role in phenomenological models of mhd turbulence ; comprehensive reviews of recent analytical and numerical results can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the ideal mhd system  ( [ mhd - elsasser ] ) conserves the two independent elsasser energies , @xmath17 , related to the total energy and cross - helicity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . in a turbulent state ,",
    "when energy is supplied to the system at large scales , both energies @xmath20 cascade toward small scales where they are converted into heat by viscosity and resistivity .",
    "theories and numerical simulations of mhd turbulence address the fourier spectra of the energies @xmath21 in the inertial range of scales , that is , scales much smaller than the forcing scales and much larger than the dissipation scales .    in the picture of counter - propagating alfvn modes",
    "it is often assumed that energy spectra are the same for both kinetic and magnetic fluctuations , since such energy equipartition holds for individual alfvn wave packets .",
    "however , recent solar wind observations demonstrate contradictions with this assumption : the fourier energy spectra of magnetic and velocity fluctuations appear to have different slopes in the inertial interval @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the mismatch in the spectra found in numerical simulations of strong mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "most intriguing , however , is the fact that significant difference between magnetic and kinetic energies was detected in numerical studies of _ weak _ mhd turbulence @xcite consisting of mostly independent alfvn waves for which equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies holds exactly .",
    "the mismatch between magnetic and kinetic energies , the so - called residual energy @xmath22 , was noted in previous works , e.g. , @xcite , however , it has not been fully explored in models of mhd turbulence , since such models are often based on the conserved quantities , @xmath20 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , which do not contain information about the residual energy . in this work we present the analytic derivation of the residual energy in the case of weak mhd turbulence .",
    "we demonstrate that residual energy is spontaneously generated by interacting alfven waves even if it is absent initially , it plays a fundamental role in the turbulent dynamics , and it provides a qualitative explanation for the breakdown of magnetic and kinetic equipartition observed in the solar wind .",
    "we concentrate on turbulence of shear - alfvn waves whose polarizations are normal to the guide field , @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the guide field is strong ; its strength with respect to the magnetic and velocity fluctuations is characterized by a small parameter @xmath26 .",
    "we also assume that the turbulence is _ weak _ , that is , the wave spectrum in the field - parallel direction is broad enough to ensure that the nonlinear terms are small , @xmath27 , [ weak ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are typical wave numbers characterizing the spectral width in the field - parallel and field - perpendicular directions and @xmath28 are typical ( rms ) values of the fluctuations .",
    "the elsasser fourier energies are given by the correlation functions @xmath29 while the residual energy is related to @xmath30 in these formulas we assume spatial homogeneity and average over a statistical ensemble .",
    "the elsasser energies are real , while the residual correlation function satisfies @xmath31 .",
    "its real part is then the residual energy @xmath32 . in practical applications one",
    "also uses the phase - volume compensated residual energy defined as @xmath33 . in previous treatments @xcite ,",
    "the residual energy was assumed to be zero as it would be the case for independent @xmath34 and @xmath35 waves . in the present study",
    "we do not make such an assumption , rather , we _ derive _ the equation for the residual energy .",
    "the derivation is performed perturbatively in  @xmath36 , following the standard procedure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when the nonlinear terms in eq .",
    "( [ mhd - elsasser ] ) are neglected , both @xmath37 oscillate in time and so does the residual energy , @xmath38 . when the nonlinear interaction is taken into account , @xmath39 acquires small corrections that one finds , to the first nonvanishing order , by integrating the equation : @xmath40 \\nonumber   \\\\ & + q^{-}({\\bf q})[q^{+}({\\bf p})-q^+({\\bf k } ) ] \\}{\\tilde \\delta}(q_\\| ) \\delta({\\bf",

    "since we are interested in spontaneous generation of the residual energy , we assume that it is absent initially , therefore , in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) we neglected the terms proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) is standard although lengthy , and it will be presented elsewhere . in what follows",
    "we discuss the main consequences of the obtained result .",
    "first , we notice that the integral in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) is essentially nonzero .",
    "it therefore describes the _ generation _ of the residual energy by alfvn waves .",
    "the important conclusion is that the residual energy is generated by nonlinear interactions even if it is zero initially .",
    "moreover , one can directly verify that for all the spectra of interest , the integral in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) is positive . as we shall see below",
    ", this means that the generated residual energy is negative , that is , the magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic one .",
    "a simple evaluation of the integral in eq .  ( [ bp - eq ] ) can be performed for the case of balanced mhd turbulence , that is , for @xmath45 . in this case ,",
    "the elsasser energy spectra have the well known scaling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is arbitrary , and we assume that it is smooth at least initially . for the reasons that will be clear momentarily , we estimate the integral in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) at @xmath1 : @xmath48 where the numerical factor is @xmath49 .",
    ", however , our discussion of scaling properties of the residual energy does not require the knowledge of numerical coefficients with such precision .",
    "] non - vanishing of this term at @xmath1 implies that eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) has a solution diverging in time , which is unphysical .",
    "the reason is that when @xmath39 becomes large one can not neglect the nonlinear terms containing @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) .",
    "as we shall see , in order to obtain the convergent result , it is enough to retain the terms linear in @xmath39 , which are proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "those terms describe relaxation of the residual energy due to its interaction with the elsasser energies . their structure can be found from a simple estimate , if one notices that these terms should have the same dimensional structure as the rhs term in eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) , if one replaces one of @xmath51 by @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding relaxation term can thus be added to the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) in the form @xmath52 , with the relaxation rate @xmath53 .",
    "the estimate of the relaxation rate at @xmath1 gives : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "coincides with the inverse time of nonlinear spectral energy transfer in weak mhd turbulence , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "]    collecting the results ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ bp - eq ] ) in the form : @xmath56 which has to be solved together with the initial condition @xmath57 .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath58 and the residual energy is found as @xmath59 the residual energy can be re - written as @xmath60 where the @xmath61 function has support inside a narrow wedge - shaped domain : @xmath62 according to the result @xmath63 , the function @xmath61 would turn into the @xmath64-function in the limit  @xmath65 .",
    "this explains why the region around @xmath1 was relevant in our estimates ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "we will refer to such a spectrum as `` condensate '' .",
    "it is also convenient to define the field - perpendicular spectrum of the residual energy , @xmath66 expressions ( [ er]-[erperp ] ) are the main results of the present work .",
    "in this section we test our analytic predictions in numerical simulations . in the presence of a strong guide field , the universal properties of mhd turbulence can be studied in the framework of reduced mhd , which can be effectively used in numerical simulations of both strong and weak turbulence , e.g. , @xcite . in our numerical set - up ,",
    "the @xmath67 and @xmath68 fields are _ independently _ driven by gaussian distributed random , short - time correlated forces with zero mean and prescribed variances , so that no residual energy is supplied by the driving routine .",
    "the forces are applied at @xmath69 & @xmath70 in the fourier space .",
    "the box is elongated in the field - parallel direction according to @xmath71 .",
    "we employ a fully dealiased pseudo - spectral method ; the run has the resolution of @xmath72 , the reynolds number @xmath73 , and it is averaged over 41 large - scale eddy turnover times .",
    "we choose viscosity equal to magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the details on the code and the numerical set - up can be found in @xcite .",
    "we find that the residual - energy condensate is indeed generated in weak balanced mhd turbulence , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : cond ] ) .",
    "the condensate is negative , and its broadening with @xmath3 shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : level ] ) is consistent with the linear law predicted in eq .",

    "the scaling behavior of the field - perpendicular spectrum of the residual energy is also consistent with the analytic prediction ( [ erperp ] ) , see fig .",
    "( [ fig : level ] ) . when we repeated the computation for the imbalanced case , that is , the case when @xmath74 ( not presented here ) , we did not detect essential changes in the structure and scaling of the condensate .",

    "in this letter we demonstrated that residual energy is spontaneously generated by nonlinearly interacting alfvn waves , and it accumulates in a narrow region of phase space ( [ wedge ] ) .",
    "this explains the phenomenon of ` condensate ' of the residual energy numerically observed in @xcite . although the total ( phase - space integrated ) residual energy is small , its presence is crucial for the turbulent dynamics , for the following reason .",
    "inside region ( [ wedge ] ) , that is , for @xmath75 the residual energy is comparable to the elsasser energies and it follows the same scaling , @xmath76 . since the turbulent cascade of alfvn waves crucially depends on the modes with @xmath77 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the residual energy crucially affects the dynamics of the elsasser modes .",
    "more formally , this is expressed in the fact that one of the elsasser energies enters the kinetic equations in the combination @xmath78 , where @xmath79 are concentrated in the region ( [ wedge ] ) , see , e.g. , eq .  ( [ bp - eq ] ) . in previous treatments of weak mhd turbulence @xcite , it was assumed that @xmath80 are smooth functions of @xmath2 , that is , their dynamically important components with @xmath81 have the same @xmath3-scaling as the components with @xmath82 .",
    "such an assumption would be self - consistent if the residual energy were absent .",
    "however , as we have demonstrated , the residual energy is spontaneously generated by interacting alfvn waves .",
    "one can argue that the presence of the residual energy modifies the spectra of the elsasser energies that , together with their smooth parts , @xmath83 , now acquire their own singular parts @xmath84 , where @xmath85 are concentrated in region ( [ wedge ] ) . when multiplied by @xmath79 and integrated over @xmath2 , both the smooth and the singular parts provide comparable contributions to the integrals .",
    "we established that the spontaneously generated residual energy is always negative .",
    "although this result is obtained in the framework of weak mhd turbulence , it provides the first analytic explanation for the observational and numerical findings that magnetic energy exceeds kinetic energy in the inertial interval of mhd turbulence , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we derived that the residual energy has the field - perpendicular spectrum @xmath86 ( [ erperp ] ) .",
    "this relatively shallow spectrum holds in the inertial interval and breaks down at sufficiently large @xmath3 when the nonlinear broadening of the residual energy spectrum in the field - parallel direction ( [ wedge ] ) becomes comparable to the width of the field - parallel energy spectra of the alfvn waves , @xmath87 .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that this is precisely the scale beyond which the weak interaction approximation breaks down , and the turbulence becomes strong . in our future work we will extend our analysis of residual energy to the case of strong mhd turbulence .",
