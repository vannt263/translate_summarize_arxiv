    "since a long time electromagnetic two - nucleon knockout reactions have been devised as a preferential tool to investigate two - body correlations in nuclei @xcite . indeed , the probability that a real or virtual photon is absorbed by a pair of nucleons should be a direct measurement of the correlations between the two nucleons .",
    "for an exclusive reaction the transitions amplitudes contain the two - nucleon overlap function ( tof ) between the ground state of the target and the final state of the residual nucleus . in the cross section",
    "the tof gives the two - hole spectral density function , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath1 which in its diagonal form ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) gives the joint probability of removing from the target two nucleons , with momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 , leaving the residual nucleus in a state with energy @xmath6 with respect to the target ground state .",
    "in an inclusive reaction , integrating the spectral density function over the whole energy spectrum produces the two - body density matrix @xmath7 , that in its diagonal form and in the coordinate representation gives the pair correlation function @xmath8 , _ i.e. _ the conditional probability density of finding in the target a particle at @xmath9 if another one is known to be at @xmath10 .",
    "the two - nucleon overlap , the two - hole spectral function and the two - body density matrix contain information on nuclear structure and correlations .",
    "the problem is that it is not easy to disentangle these quantities from the experimental cross sections and extract clear and unambiguous information on correlations . in order to achieve this goal , along with the experimental work ,",
    "a reliable theoretical model is needed , where all the ingredients are well under control .    by correlations we mean what goes beyond the independent - particle model , the mean - field approximation .",
    "of particular interest are the short - range correlations ( src ) , which are produced by the short - range repulsion of the nn - interaction .",
    "src are of particular relevance for pp - pairs and are essential for understanding the short - range and high - momentum properties of the nuclear wave functions",
    ". also very interesting are the tensor correlations ( tc ) , which are due to the strong tensor component of the nn - interaction , that is of intermediate to long - range character .",
    "tc are of particular relevance for pn - pairs . thus src and tc can be investigated for pp- and pn - pairs .",
    "such an investigation would be of great interest , since the short - range repulsion and the tensor character represent the two main features of the nn - interaction . also very important are , however , the so - called long - range correlations ( lrc ) at low energy , which mainly represent the interaction of nucleons at the nuclear surface and are related to the coupling between the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "dynamics and the collective excitation modes of the nucleus .",
    "src , tc , and lrc are intertwined in the spectral function and in the density matrix and it is not easy to disentangle a specific contribution . a reliable model for cross section calculations requires a careful and consistent treatment of these different types of correlations .",
    "moreover , the cross section is sensitive to the reaction mechanism .",
    "there are two competing processes contributing to two - nucleon knockout .",
    "there is the process where the electromagnetic probe hits , through a one - body ( ob ) current , either nucleon of a correlated pair and both nucleons are then ejected from the nucleus .",
    "two nucleons can not be emitted by an ob current unless they are correlated .",
    "thus , this process is entirely due to correlations .",
    "two nucleons , however , can also and naturally be emitted by two - body ( tb ) currents , due to meson exchanges and @xmath11-isobar excitations , even if they are not correlated .",
    "the role and relevance of these two competing processes can be different in different situations and kinematics , but if situations can be envisaged where the ob current is dominant , these situations are very well suited to investigate correlations",
    ".    it must be noted , however , that correlations affect also the process due to the tb currents . in the model",
    "@xcite the transition amplitudes contain three main ingredients : the nuclear current , the two - nucleon scattering wave function , and the tof , which includes correlations .",
    "the two - nucleon wave functions for the initial and final states are consistently treated in the transition amplitudes with the ob and the tb currents .",
    "thus , correlations affect also the contribution of the tb currents and in principle it is possible to obtain information on correlations even when the tb currents are important or dominant in the cross section .    moreover , it is not correct to say that the contribution of the ob current is entirely due to correlations in the nuclear wave functions . in the calculation of the transition amplitudes , for the three - body system consisting of the two nucleons and the residual nucleus ,",
    "it is natural to work with center - of - mass ( cm ) coordinates , and in the cm frame a tb operator is obtained in the transition amplitude even with an ob current @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this cm effect depends on the particular situation that is considered and may be large or small , but , independently of that , due to this cm effects there is a contribution to two nucleons emission with an ob current also without correlations in the nuclear wave functions .",
    "the main features of the theoretical approach are outlined in sec .",
    "special emphasis is devoted to the description of the recent improvements performed in comparison with earlier work .",
    "numerical results for the exclusive pp- and pn - knockout reactions off @xmath0o are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "3 also in comparison with the available data .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the basic ingredients for calculations of the reaction induced by a real or virtual photon , with momentum , where two nucleons , with momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are emitted from a nucleus , are the transition matrix elements of the charge - current density operator between initial and final nuclear states , _ i.e. _ @xmath14 bilinear products of these integrals give the components of the hadron tensor whose suitable combinations give all the observables available from the reaction process .",
    "the model is based on the two assumptions of an exclusive reaction , where the residual nucleus is left in a discrete eigenstate of its hamiltonian , and of the direct knockout mechanism . as a results of these two assumptions , the matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jm ] ) are obtained in the form @xcite @xmath15 equation  ( [ eq : jq ] ) contains three main ingredients : the nuclear current @xmath16 , the two - nucleon scattering wave function @xmath17 , and the tof @xmath18 . in the model @xmath18 and @xmath17",
    "are consistently derived from an energy - dependent non - hermitian feshbach - type hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "actually , they are eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian and of its hermitian conjugate at different energies : for an exclusive reaction , we select a channel and then project the initial and final nuclear states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jm ] ) onto the selected channel subspace ; as a result of the projection , we obtain the optical - model hamiltonian describing the interaction of the two nucleons and the residual nucleus in the eigenstate that we have selected @xcite .",
    "since a fully consistent calculation of @xmath17 and @xmath18 as eigenfunctions of the optical - model hamiltonian would be very difficult , some approximations are used in actual calculations .",
    "the nuclear current operator is the sum of an ob and a tb part .",
    "the ob part contains the longitudinal charge term and the convection and spin currents .",
    "the tb currents are derived from a nonrelativistic reduction of the lowest - order feynman diagrams with one - pion exchange .",
    "therefore we have currents corresponding to the seagull and pion - in - flight diagrams , and to the diagrams with intermediate @xmath11-isobar configurations @xcite .",
    "all these terms contribute to pn - knockout , while the seagull and the pion - in - flight meson - exchange currents ( mec ) do not contribute to pp - emission , at least in the adopted nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the contribution of the tb currents depends on the type of reaction , on the kinematics , on the conditions of the calculations , and , of course , on the treatment of the tb currents .",
    "the explicit expressions of the currents can be found in @xcite .",
    "different parametrizations have been used in previous calculations , in particular for the @xmath11-current .",
    "a fundamental treatment of the @xmath11 in electromagnetic breakup reactions on complex nuclei is presently unavailable and we can only rely on approximative schemes .    in our most recent calculations @xcite , the parameters of the @xmath11-current are fixed considering the nn - scattering in the @xmath11-region , where a reasonable description of scattering data is achieved with parameters similar to the ones of the full bonn potential @xcite . for pp - knockout , besides the usual @xmath19-exchange , also @xmath20-exchange is included and the coupling constants are @xmath21 moreover , hadronic form factors are included @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and the cutoffs @xmath24    for pn - knockout , where the tb current contains many more terms , a simpler approach is adopted @xcite where only @xmath19-exchange is included and the parameters for the @xmath11-current are @xmath25 these parameters are able to give , with only @xmath19-exchange , a comparable description of the nn - scattering data . with respect to the pion - in - flight and seagull mec , contributing only to pn - knockout , a dipole cutoff is used of 3 gev , in accordance with the bonn - c potential @xcite which is used also in the calculation of the tof @xcite and of the mutual interaction between the two outgoing nucleons @xcite .",
    "this choice of parameters for the tb currents is called in the following bonn parametrization .",

    "( [ formpn ] ) were used with a simpler regularization in coordinate space , both for the mec and the @xmath11-current , which in practice is similar to an unregularized prescription ( @xmath26 ) .      in the scattering state",
    "@xmath17 the two outgoing nucleons , 1 and 2 , and the residual nucleus interact via the potential @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the interaction between the nucleon @xmath29 and the residual nucleus , described in the model by a complex optical potential , and @xmath30 denotes the mutual interaction between the two outgoing nucleons .",
    "only the contribution of the final - state interaction ( fsi ) due to @xmath28 was included in our first calculations . in this approximation ( dw )",
    "the two - nucleon scattering wave function is given by the product of two uncoupled s.p .",
    "distorted wave functions , eigenfunctions of a phenomenological optical potential fitted to nucleon - nucleus scattering data @xcite .",
    "the contribution of @xmath30 ( nn - fsi ) has been studied within a perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of fsi is given in general by the optical potential , which produces an overall and substantial reduction of the calculated cross sections .",
    "this effect is important and can never be neglected .",
    "nn - fsi gives in general an enhancement of the cross section that depends strongly on the kinematics , on the type of reaction , and on the final state of the residual nucleus .",
    "it is generally larger in pp- than in pn - knockout and in electro- than in photoinduced reactions @xcite . in",
    "many situations the difference between the results obtained in the dw approach and in the more complete approach where also nn - fsi is included ( dw - nn ) is small .",
    "there are , however , also situations where this difference is large .",
    "numerical examples are presented in sec .",
    "the tof @xmath18 contains information on nuclear structure and correlations and represents the most interesting ingredient of the model .",
    "different approaches have been used @xcite to calculate @xmath18 in pp- and pn - knockout from @xmath0o .",
    "@xmath0o is a suitable target for this study , due to the presence of discrete final states in the excitation - energy spectrum of the residual nucleus , both for @xmath31c and @xmath31n , states well separated in energy and that can be separated in experiments with good energy resolution .",
    "experimental data are available for both @xmath0o(e , e@xmath32pp ) @xcite and @xmath0o ( e , e@xmath32pn ) @xcite reactions .    in a simpler approach @xcite the tof is given by the product of a coupled and antisymmetrized shell - model ( sm ) pair function and a jastrow - type central and state independent correlation function taken from @xcite . in this approach ( sm - src ) only src are included in the correlation function and the final state of the residual nucleus is a pure two - hole state in the target .",
    "for instance , the ground state of @xmath31c is a ( @xmath33)@xmath34 hole in @xmath0o .    in the more sophisticated approaches",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the tof is obtained from the the first calculations of the two - nucleon spectral function of @xmath0o , where src , tc and lrc are included with some approximations but consistently . in both calculations the tof s for low - lying states of the residual nucleus are obtained partitioning the hilbert space onto two subspaces where src and lrc are separately calculated .",
    "lrc and the long - range part of tc are calculated using the self - consistent green s function formalism @xcite in an appropriate harmonic - oscillator ( h.o . ) basis , large enough to account for the main collective features that influence the pair removal amplitudes .",
    "the effects of src due to the central and tensor part at high momenta are included by defect functions , which are solutions of a bethe - goldstone equation where the pauli operator considers only configurations outside the model space where lrc are calculated .",
    "different defect functions are obtained for different relative states and the bonn c nn - potential @xcite is used in the calculations .",
    "the tof is given by a combination of components of relative and cm motion , that are different for different final states , where the coefficients are the two - nucleon removal amplitudes which include lrc , and the defect functions , which contain src , are intertwined in a complicated manner .    in the more recent calculation @xcite",
    "some improvements have been included with respect to the previous work @xcite : i ) the non - locality of the pauli operator is computed exactly , resulting in a larger number of defect functions with a more complicate state dependence ; ii ) the evaluation of nuclear structure effects related to the fragmentation of the s.p . strength has been improved by applying a faddeev technique to the description of the internal propagators in the nucleon self - energy . moreover ,",
    "both pp- and pn - pairs are calculated in @xcite , while only the pp - case is considered in @xcite .",
    "the numerical results presented in this contribution are obtained with the more recent tof s from @xcite ( sf - b ) .",
    "in @xcite the defect functions for pn - knockout off @xmath0o are calculated within the framework of the coupled cluster ( cc ) method , using the so - called @xmath35 approximation , and employing the argonne v14 nn - potential @xcite .",
    "also in this calculation ( sf - cc ) the defect functions include src and tc and have a complicate state dependence .",
    "lrc , however , are accounted for in the tof in a simpler way and only knockout of nucleons from the @xmath36 shell is considered .",
    "an alternative procedure is proposed in @xcite , where the tof is obtained from the asympotic behavior of the two - body density matrix ( tdm ) .",
    "this procedure avoids the calculation of the spectral function , but depends strongly and relies on the availability of reliable calculations of the tdm .",
    "the applicability of the procedure is shown in @xcite , where the tof obtained from a simple tdm , which is calculated within the jastrow correlation method @xcite ( jcm ) and incorporates only src , is able to give numerical results that under many aspects are qualitatively similar to the results produced by more sophisticated approaches .",
    "the tdm of @xcite is at present the only tdm available for these calculations",
    ". it would be interesting to check the procedure with a more complete tdm .      in the calculation of the transition amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jq ] ) , for the three - body system consisting of the two nucleons , 1 and 2 , and of the residual nucleus @xmath37 , it is natural to work with cm coordinates @xcite @xmath38 the conjugated momenta are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the momentum of the residual nucleus in the laboratory frame .    with the help of these relations , the transition amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jq ] ) is obtained in the following form @xcite @xmath41 where for the ob current @xmath42 @xmath43 similar expressions are obtained for the tb currents @xcite .    in spite of the fact that an ob operator can not affect two particles if they are not correlated , it can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jqcm ] ) and ( [ eq : opcm ] ) that in the cm frame the transition operator becomes a tb operator even in the case of an ob nuclear current . only in the limit @xmath44 ,",
    "cm effects vanish and the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jq ] ) becomes zero for a pure ob current when the matrix element is calculated using orthogonalized s.p .",
    "wave functions .",
    "this means that , due to this cm effect , for finite nuclei the ob current can give a contribution to the cross section of two - particle emission even without correlations in the nuclear wave functions @xcite .",
    "independently of the specific prescriptions adopted in the calculations , a conceptual problem arises in the model , where the initial and final states , @xmath18 and @xmath17 , which are eigenfunctions of an energy - dependent optical - model hamiltonian , are , as such , not orthogonal .",
    "indeed , the process involves transitions between bound and continuum states which must be orthogonal , since they are eigenfunctions of the full nuclear many - body hamiltionian .",
    "orthogonality is in general lost in a model when the description is restricted to a subspace where other channels are suppressed .",
    "the description of direct knockout reactions in terms of the eigenfunctions of a complex energy - dependent optical potential considers only partially the contribution of competing inelastic channels .",
    "a consequence of the lack of orthogonality between the initial and the final state is that eq .",
    "( [ eq : jqcm ] ) may contain a spurious contribution , since it does not vanish when the transition operator @xmath45 is set equal to 1 .",
    "the use of an effective nuclear current operator would remove the orthogonality defect besides taking into account space truncation effects @xcite . in the usual approach , however , the replacement of the effective operator by the bare nuclear current operator may introduce a spurious contribution .    in our earlier work @xcite the spuriosity",
    "was removed subtracting from the transition amplitude the contribution of the ob current without correlations in the nuclear wave functions .",
    "this prescription , however , subtracts , together with the spuriosity , also the cm effect given by the tb operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : opcm ] ) , that is present in the ob current independently of correlations in the nuclear wave function , and that is not spurious .",
    "moreover , the definition of a nuclear wave function without correlations is clear in the simpler approach sm - src , where the uncorrelated sm pair function is multiplied by a correlation function , but it is less clear in a more sophisticated approach , like sf - b , where different types of correlations are intertwined in the tof . in this case",
    "the prescription is applied subtracting the part of the tof without the defect functions .",
    "the defect functions , however , include only src , while different correlations are intertwined in the remaining part of the tof that is subtracted .",
    "therefore , with this prescription also part of the contribution of correlations is subtracted .",
    "a more accurate procedure to get rid of the spuriosity is adopted in @xcite , where orthogonality between the initial and final states is enforced by means of a gram - schmidt orthogonalization @xcite . in this approach",
    "each one of the two s.p .",
    "distorted scattering wave functions is orthogonalized to all the s.p .",

    "i.e. _ , for the tof of @xcite , to the h.o",

    "states used to calculate the sm pair function .    the procedure to enforce orthogonality between s.p .",
    "bound and scattering states is done accordingly with the definition of the spurious contribution , that in the limit @xmath44 , where cm effects are neglected , the transition amplitude vanishes for a pure ob current sandwiched between orthogonalized s.p .",
    "wave functions .",
    "the orthogonalization procedure adopted in our recent work @xcite removes the spurious contribution and includes all the cm and correlation effects that were subtracted with the previous prescription and that are not spurious .",
    "the relevance of these effects depends on the type of reaction , on the kinematics , and on the treatment of the theoretical ingredients of the model @xcite . in many situations the differences between the results obtained with the two procedures are small .",
    "there are , however , situations where these differences are large , and they are very large in the super - parallel kinematics .",
    "this is a kinematical setting of particular interest , since the recent @xmath0o(e , e@xmath32pp)@xmath31c @xcite and @xmath0o(e , e@xmath32pn)@xmath31n @xcite experiments carried out at mami are both centred on the same super - parallel kinematics .",
    "the super - parallel kinematics was originally proposed @xcite since it is particularly favourable to emphasize short - range effects and has been widely investigated in our work .",
    "recent results @xcite have shown that this kinematic setting is indeed very sensitive to correlations , but it is also very sensitive to all the other ingredients of the model .",
    "such a great sensitivity makes the super - parallel kinematics very interesting although not very suitable to isolate the specific contribution of correlations from other competing contributions .",
    "the achievement of this goal requires experiments in a wider range of kinematics which mutually supplement each other .",
    "these arguments are illustrated in the next section with some numerical examples .",
    "in the super - parallel kinematics the two nucleons are ejected parallel and anti - parallel to @xmath49 and , for a fixed value of @xmath50 and of the energy transfer @xmath51 , it is possible to explore , for different values of the kinetic energies of the outgoing nucleons , all possible values of the recoil - momentum @xmath52 .    in fig .",

    "with the simpler sm - src , where only src are taken into account , the contribution of the ob current is negligible and is up to about three orders of magnitude lower than the one obtained with sf - b . when the tb currents are added , the sm - src cross section is enhanced by about one order of magnitude , the difference between the sm - src and sf - b cross sections is reduced but remains very large , up to about two orders of magnitude in the maximum region and somewhat smaller at high values of @xmath52 .",
    "the sm - src cross section is dominated by the tb currents and , as such , it is practically unaffected by the use of orthogonalized s.p . bound and scattering wave functions .",
    "incidentally , we note that for the separate contribution of the ob current the cm effects included in the orthogonalized approach give with sm - src a much smaller effect than with sf - b and sf - cc , whose cross sections are , in both cases , dominated by the ob current .",
    "the dominance of the ob current is due to the very large enhancement of the ob contribution produced , both with sf - b and sf - cc , by the cm effects included the orthogonalized approach . in the previous calculations with sf - b @xcite and sf - cc @xcite the cross section to the @xmath58 state was in both cases dominated by the tb @xmath11-current .",
    "the much larger contribution of the ob current found with sf - b and sf - cc emphasizes the crucial role played by tc , that are very important in pn - emission and are neglected in the simpler sm - src calculation . in the sf - b and sf - cc overlap functions , src and tc",
    "are accounted for consistently in the defect functions , which are calculated in the two tof s within different methods .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] the sf - b cross section is generally larger than the sf - cc one . the sf - b result overshoots the sf - cc one up to a factor of 6 in the maximum region . the differences are strongly reduced for values of @xmath59 greater than 100 mev/@xmath57 .",
    "the differences between the two cross sections are due to the different treatment of src , tc and lrc .",
    "a more complete calculation of lrc in an extended shell - model basis is performed in sf - b @xcite , where the normalization of the two - nucleon overlap amplitudes is higher than in sf - cc .",
    "the difference in the shape of the cross section is due to the different mixing of configurations in the two calculations .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] emphasize the need of a careful and consistent treatment of different correlations in the tof .",
    "the contribution of nn - fsi , that is very large in the super - parallel kinematics for the ( e , e@xmath32pp ) reaction , is strongly reduced in the same kinematics for pn - knockout , and it is quite moderate for the @xmath58 state @xcite .",
    "the strong enhancement of the cross section to the @xmath58 state at low values of @xmath52 , that is due to the cm effects included in the orthogonalized approach , is able to resolve the discrepancies found @xcite in comparison with the experimental data and give a much better agreement @xcite .",
    "a careful comparison with the data will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the super - parallel kinematics is particularly sensitive to all the ingredients of the model .",
    "different results can be obtained in different situations .",
    "a suitable choice of kinematics can be helpful to disentangle specific contributions and reduce the uncertainties on the theoretical ingredients .",
    "an example of a different kinematics is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig6 ] , where the cross sections of the reactions @xmath0o(@xmath60,pp)@xmath31c@xmath61 and @xmath0o(@xmath60,pn)@xmath31n to the @xmath62 state are displayed , for a coplanar symmetrical kinematics with an incident photon energy @xmath63 mev . in symmetrical kinematics",
    "the two nucleons are ejected at equal energies and equal but opposite angles with respect to @xmath49 , and different values of @xmath52 are obtained changing the scattering angles of the two outgoing nucleons . in this",
    "kinematics the difference between the results of the orthogonalized and the previous prescription are generally small @xcite , and also the effects of nn - fsi are very small .",
    "the cross sections are , however , very sensitive to the parametrization of the tb - currents .",
    "the results of the bonn and the unregularized parametrizations , which are compared in the left panel of the figure , differ by about one order of magnitude .",
    "also for this kinematics the results are very sensitive to the treatment of correlations in the tof .",
    "the cross sections calculated with different tof s , which are compared in the right panels , exhibit very large differences , both in magnitude and shape .",
    "recent improvements in the theortical description of electromagnetic two - nucleon knockout have been reviewed : the sensitivity to the correlations included in the nuclear wave functions , the parametrization used for the tb currents , the effects of final - state interactions , and the role of center - of - mass effects in connection with the problem of the lack of orthogonality between bound and scattering states obtained by the use of an energy - dependent optical potential .",
    "numerical examples have been presented for pp- and pn - knockout off @xmath0o also in comparison with the available data .",
    "the most refined version of the model , with the best available ingredients , is able to give a reasonable , although not perfect , description of the experimental data .",
    "this result is an indication that the main theoretical ingredients contributing to the cross section seem reasonably under control .",
    "the cross sections are very sensitive to correlations and to their treatment .",
    "different type of correlations , of short - range and long - range type , are important and require a careful and consistent treatment .",
    "an essential role is played by tensor correlations in pn - knockout .",
    "the complexity of the necessary model ingredients makes it difficult to extract clear and unambigous information on correlations from one or two `` ideal '' kinematics .",
