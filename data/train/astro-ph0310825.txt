    "the lagrangian approximation for structure formation in cosmological fluids provides a relatively accurate model even in quasi - linear regime , where density fluctuation becomes unity .",
    "the zeldovich approximation ( hereafter za )  @xcite , a linear lagrangian approximation for dust fluid , describes the evolution of density fluctuation better than eulerian approximation  @xcite .",
    "although za gives an accurate description until quasi - linear regime develops , za can not describe the model after the formation of caustics . in za , even after the formation of caustics , the fluid elements keeps moving in the direction set up by the initial condition .",
    "za can not describe compact and high density structures such as pancakes , skeletons , or clumps , while n - body simulation shows the presence of clumps with a very wide range in mass at any given time  @xcite .",
    "in general , after the formation of caustics , hydrodynamical description becomes invalid . in order to proceed with a hydrodynamical description without the formation of caustics ,",
    "the qualitative pressure gradient  @xcite and thermal velocity scatter  @xcite in a collisionless medium had been discussed .",
    "after that , the ` adhesion approximation '  @xcite was proposed from the consideration of nonlinear wave equations like burgers equation . in the ` adhesion approximation '",
    ", an artificial viscosity term is added to za . as another modification , a gaussian cutoff",
    "is applied to the initial power spectrum of density fluctuation and then evolves with the za .",
    "this modified approximation is called the ` truncated zeldovich approximation ' ( hereafter tza )  @xcite .",
    "these modified approximations successfully avoid the formation of caustics and describe the evolution for long time .",
    "however , the physical origin of the modification is not clarified .",
    "we reconsider the basic , fundamental equation for the motion of matter .",
    "the collisionless boltzmann equation  @xcite describes the motion of matter in phase space .",
    "the basic equations of hydrodynamics are obtained by integrating the collisionless boltzmann equation over velocity space . in past approximations , such as za and its modified version ,",
    "velocity dispersion was ignored .",
    "buchert and domnguez  @xcite argued that the effect of velocity dispersion become important beyond the caustics .",
    "they also argued that models for large - scale structure should rather be constructed for a flow which describes the average motion of a multi - stream system .",
    "then they showed that when the velocity dispersion is still small and can be considered isotropic , that gives effective pressure or viscosity terms .",
    "furthermore , they argued the relation between mass density @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 , i.e. an ` equation of state ' .",
    "if the relation between the density of matter and pressure seems barotropic , the equation of state should take the form @xmath3 .",
    "buchert et al .",
    "@xcite showed how the viscosity term is generated by the effective pressure of a fluid under the assumption that the peculiar acceleration is parallel to the peculiar velocity ; domnguez  @xcite clarified that a hydrodynamic formulation is obtained via a spatial coarse graining in a many - body gravitating system , and the viscosity term in the ` adhesion approximation ' can be derived by the expansion of coarse - grained equations .",
    "domnguez  @xcite also reported on a study of the spatially coarse - grained velocity dispersion in cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "the analysis showed that polytrope exponent becomes @xmath4 in a quasi - nonlinear regime , and @xmath5 in a strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "domnguez and melott  @xcite discussed polytrope exponents of velocity dispersion in n - body simulations . according to their results ,",
    "the exponents depend on a model of initial density fluctuation .    from these points ,",
    "the extension of lagrangian perturbation theory to cosmological fluids with pressure has been considered .",
    "actually , adler and buchert  @xcite have formulated the lagrangian perturbation theory for a barotropic fluid .",
    "morita and tatekawa  @xcite and tatekawa et al .",
    "@xcite solved the lagrangian perturbation equations for a polytropic fluid up to second order for cases where the equations are solved easily .",
    "hereafter , we call this model the ` pressure model ' . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the density field which is described by the lagrangian approximations ; za , tza , and first - order pressure model solutions .",
    "we calculate the cross - correlation function of density field between the lagrangian approximation and n - body simulation .",
    "furthermore we analyze the probability distribution function of density fluctuation for confirmation . from these results ,",
    "we determine a polytrope exponent in the equation of state . from our analyses of the cross - correlation coefficient and probability distribution function of density fluctuation , we find that the value of the polytrope exponent seems to be @xmath0 for quasi - nonlinear evolution , as buchert and domnguez argued  @xcite .",
    "however , for the determination of a proportion fixed number in equation of state , we must consider further physical processes or carry out high - resolutional n - body simulation .",

    "[ sec : discuss ] , we discuss our results and state conclusions .",
    "in this section , we present perturbative solutions in the lagrangian description . the matter model we consider is a self - gravitating fluid with mass density @xmath1 and ` pressure ' @xmath2 , which is given by the presence of velocity dispersion .",
    "the ` pressure ' we adopt here is the same as was introduced by buchert and domnguez  @xcite , i.e. the diagonal component of the velocity dispersion tensor when the velocity dispersion is assumed to be isotropic in the jeans equation  @xcite . in lagrangian hydrodynamics ,",
    "the comoving coordinates @xmath6 of the fluid elements are represented in terms of lagrangian coordinates @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath7 are defined as initial values of @xmath6 , and @xmath9 denotes the lagrangian displacement vector due to the presence of inhomogeneities . from the jacobian of the coordinate transformation from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , @xmath10 ,",

    "the transverse modes can be solved easily .",
    "the first - order solutions become as follows : @xmath14 because the solutions do not depend on pressure , the solutions of this mode in za become the same in form .",
    "the transverse modes do not have a growing solution in a first - order approximation .",
    "for the longitudinal modes , we carry out fourier transformation with respect to the lagrangian coordinates @xmath7 . if we assume a polytropic equation of state @xmath15 with a constant @xmath16 and a polytrope exponent @xmath17 , we can write an explicit form of first - order perturbative solutions . in the einstein - de sitter background ,",
    "the solutions are written in a relatively simple form .",

    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 mean background mass density and lagrangian wavenumber , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 means scale factor when an initial condition was given .",
    "here we notice the relation between the behaviors of the above solutions and the jeans wavenumber , which is defined as @xmath29 the jeans wavenumber , which gives a criterion for whether a density perturbation with a wavenumber will grow or decay with oscillation , depends on time in general .",
    "if the polytropic equation of state @xmath30 is assumed , @xmath31 equation  ( [ kjeans ] ) implies that , if @xmath32 , @xmath33 will be decreased and density perturbations with any scale will decay and disappear in evolution , and if @xmath34 , all density perturbations will grow to collapse .",
    "we rewrite the first - order solution equation  ( [ hatsbessel ] ) with the jeans wavenumber : @xmath35      za was obtained as first - order solutions with dust fluid in lagrangian description  @xcite .",
    "the solutions are obtained from the solutions of the pressure model as a limit of weak pressure .",
    "for example , in e - ds model , when we take a limit @xmath36 in equations ( [ hatsbessel ] ) and ( [ hats43 ] ) , the solutions converge to those of za : @xmath37    za is known as perturbative solutions which describe the structure well in quasi - linear scale .",
    "however if the caustics appear , the solutions no longer have physical meaning .      during evolution , the small scale structure contracts and forms caustics .",
    "therefore if we introduce some cutoff in the small scale , we will be able to avoid the formation of caustics  @xcite . in tza , for the avoidance of caustics",
    ", we introduce a gaussian cutoff to the initial density spectrum as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 means ` nonlinear wavenumber ' , defined by @xmath40 the ` nonlinear wavenumber ' depends on the scale factor .",

    "when we choose @xmath91 , @xmath41 becomes @xmath92    there are some different points to consider when we think about time evolution , although the relation seems to be as described above : first , in tza , @xmath39 affects only the initial spectrum . on the other hand",

    "second , although @xmath39 obviously depends on the initial spectrum , we did not clarify the dependence on the initial condition of @xmath41 .",
    "we think that a consideration of the physical process , which was not considered here , or the analysis of the n - body simulation , is necessary for a decision of @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath16 .",

    "how will peculiar velocity distribution change with the effect of pressure ?",
    "in za , the peculiar velocity is in proportion to the lagrangian displacement",
    ". then the growth rate of perturbation is independent of scale .",

    "therefore the peculiar velocity distribution will deviate from gaussian during evolution .",
    "of course , the peculiar velocity distribution in an n - body simulation becomes non - gaussian  @xcite .",
    "does the effect of the pressure cause the occurrence of the non - gaussian distribution ?",
    "we think that the time evolution of the peculiar velocity distribution is one of the more interesting problems .    in our model",
    ", we introduce the strong simplification that the velocity dispersion is approximately isotropic , i.e. the stress tensor is diagonal and a pressure - like term  @xcite",
    ". however , in general , the velocity dispersion does not remain isotropic in nonlinear regime . until when is the assumption to ignore anisotropic velocity dispersion reasonable ?",
    "maartens et al .",
    "@xcite discussed a relativistic kinetic theory generalization which also incorporates anisotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "then they added these effects to the linear development of density inhomogeneity and found exact solutions for their evolution . in a newtonian description , though the equations is not generally closed , we will consider anisotropic velocity dispersion and the higher - order velocity cumulant and estimate their effects on the evolution of density inhomogeneity .",
