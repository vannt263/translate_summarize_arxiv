    "entanglement @xcite is the most fascinating phenomenon in quantum information which has no classical counterpart .",
    "many future quantum technologies are based on the same",
    ". however , various mathematical investigations are on the way to explore the inherited properties of entanglement .",
    "the phenomenon of entanglement is very much fragile with respect to environmental interactions .",
    "quantum measurements also leads to decoherence which destroy the entanglement in quantum systems .",
    "if the entanglement is destroyed for finite interval of time then this phenomenon is called entanglement sudden death ( esd ) @xcite .",
    "so the study of influence of interactions on entanglement in varieties of quantum systems is important for practical quantum information processing .",
    "zhang et al . have studied the entanglement dynamics of qubit a - qubit b by taking a third qubit c which interact with the qubit @xmath2 under z component of dm interaction @xcite .",
    "they have shown that dm interaction amplify and periodically kills the entanglement between two qubits ( a and b ) and by adjusting the state ( probably amplitude ) of third qubit @xmath3 and dm interaction strength , one can manipulate the entanglement and control the entanglement sudden death ( esd ) .",
    "they have also studied the same system by taking the x - component of the dm interaction @xmath0 @xcite . here",
    "we mention that this kind of study is useful not only in qubit - qubit systems but it is also useful for hybrid quantum systems .",
    "recently , we have studied the dynamics in hybrid qubit - qutrit systems by taking the dm interaction strength in z direction @xcite .",
    "dm interaction in different directions have different impact on varieties of quantum states .",
    "so , it is interesting to study the dynamics of entanglement with x component of dm interaction .",
    "motivated , with the above studies we study the entanglement dynamics in hybrid qubit - qutrit systems with @xmath1 . in the present paper",
    "we have considered a closed system of qubit a - qutrit b , which has been prepared in two parameter states , and an auxiliary qubit @xmath3 , prepared in pure state , interacts with the qutrit @xmath2 of the closed system .",
    "the auxiliary quantum systems play an important role in quantum information processing .",
    "many auxiliary quantum systems have been investigated which assist in improving the entanglement in quantum systems @xcite .",
    "we traced away the auxiliary qubit c to calculate the reduced system dynamics .",
    "further , we study the influence of the state of auxiliary qubit c and @xmath1 on the entanglement between qubit a - qutrit b pair .",
    "we find that the state ( probability amplitude ) of third qubit @xmath3 do not influence the entanglement in two parameter qubit - qutrit states , only dm interaction influences the same .",
    "the @xmath1 is geometry dependent , so by changing the geometrical arrangement between interacting qutrit @xmath2 and qubit @xmath3 , one can manipulate the entanglement between qubit - qutrit pair .",
    "dzyaoshinshkii - moriya interaction @xcite is an anisotropic antisymmetric interaction investigated by taking into consideration the relativistic effects to describe the ferromagnetism of anti ferromagnetic crystals .",
    "quantum spin chains are the important building blocks to execute the practical quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "many spin chains with external magnetic filed and dm interaction have been investigated in varieties of configurations even at thermal conditions @xcite .",
    "spin chains have also been studied by taking as a bath in the form of spin chains with dm interaction @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that in some cases the dm interaction enhance the entanglement present in quantum spin chains .",
    "so dm interaction is a useful resource in quantum information processing .",
    "recently we also have shown the efficacy of dm interaction to free the bound entangled states @xcite in quantum information processing .",
    "in the present study , we find that dm interaction does not kill the entanglement in some two parameter qubit - qutrit states , so the affected and unaffected states have also been reported here .",
    "the two parameter qubit - qutrit states in @xmath4 quantum systems have been investigated by pyo chi @xcite and its generalization in higher dimensions @xmath5 quantum systems by yaomin @xcite .",
    "entanglement dynamics in two - parameter qubit ",
    "qutrit states under various channels has also been studied by hai - rui @xcite and hao and fu @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we present the hamiltonian of the system considered .",
    "two parameter qubit - qutrt states its separable and non - separable regions and entanglement measure have been given in sect 3 .",
    "sect 4 is devoted to the entanglement dynamics with the x component of dm interaction .",
    "finally in sect 5 , we present our conclusion .",
    "in this section , we present the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "we consider the closed system of qubit @xmath6 and qutrit @xmath2 and , an auxiliary qubit @xmath3 which interact to the qutrit @xmath2 of the closed system via @xmath1 .",
    "the schematic diagram of the system has been shown in fig .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of qubit @xmath6 and qutrit @xmath2 and @xmath9 is the interaction hamiltonian of qutrit ( b ) and qubit @xmath3 . here",
    "we consider uncoupled qubit a and qutrit b , so @xmath8 is zero .",
    "now the hamiltonian becomes @xmath10        where @xmath11 is dm interaction between qutrit @xmath2 and qubit @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath12 is a vector associated with qutrit ( b ) whose components are gell - mann matrices and @xmath13 is the pauli vector of qubit @xmath3 whose components are pauli matrices .",
    "we assume that dm interaction exist along the x - direction only .",
    "so the hamiltonian can be simplified as + @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are gell - mann matrices for qutrit @xmath2 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are pauli matrices of qubit @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the above hamiltonian is a matrix having @xmath19 dimension and is easy to diagonalize by using the method of eigendecomposition .",
    "the unitary time evolution operator is easily commutable as @xmath20 which is also a @xmath21 matrix .",
    "this matrix has been used to obtain the time evolution of density matrix of the system .",
    "we describe the two parameter class of states of qubit - qutrit and reduced system dynamics in the following subsections 3.1 and 3.2 respectively .",

    "the boundary @xmath42 is the common boundary of both the regions and states falling on this boundary belong to the separable region .",
    "to begin the study of entanglement dynamics we consider that the auxiliary qubit is prepared in pure state as below + @xmath45 + with the normalization condition + @xmath46 to study the entanglement dynamics with the @xmath1 we need to calculate the reduce density matrix of the system .",
