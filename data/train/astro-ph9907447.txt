    "success here would limit any remaining possibility of convection at the center ( otherwise @xmath32 , although the sun is not far from this state @xmath33 in standard calculations ; see kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) .",
    "an equivalent test of hydrostatic equilibrium at the center is provided by the sound speed slope , measurable in principle with @xmath0-modes alone : @xmath34 assume @xmath35 = 0 in the core and a non - singular mass distribution , so that @xmath36 thus @xmath37 must vanish .",
    "the measured sound speed slope places a limit on an unperturbed state with non - zero velocity field @xmath38 , taken here as radial for simplicity .",
    "this test checks for the presence of convective motion that does not efficiently transfer heat .",
    "such convection would not directly affect @xmath29 and the @xmath39 profile and thus is not ruled out in general by current @xmath0-mode helioseismic data .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium is modified to @xmath40 ignoring spherical - symmetry - breaking rotation and magnetic effects , also calculable .",

    "the related length scale @xmath47/few for low-@xmath14 modes ; but for high-@xmath14 @xmath1-modes concentrated near the center , it is the central scale @xmath48 @xmath49 = @xmath50 , with @xmath51 = 0.12 for the present ssm ( kennedy & bludman 1999 ) . for large @xmath14 ,",

    "thus a direct bound on the core @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 , or 1.2@xmath57 cm sec@xmath58 for @xmath15 = 1 , @xmath14 = 30 , is feasible , independent of azimuthal splitting by @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath27 profiles are sufficient to reconstruct uniquely the mechanical ( hydrostatic ) profiles . @xmath28 and @xmath59 are proportional , either one controlling the @xmath60 @xmath61 gravity modes are a result of the inhomogeneity of @xmath27 . assuming @xmath35 = 0 , @xmath29 satisfies a quadratic equation , @xmath62 with one physical root , @xmath63 ^ 2 - 4[1+{\\cal d}(r)]}\\over{2[1 + { \\cal d}(r)]}}\\quad .\\ ] ] thus the @xmath64 profile is reconstructible with @xmath28 and a numerical derivative of @xmath27 .",

    "( the @xmath75 and @xmath76 limits are well - defined in the ratios . )",
    "the present ssm inner core is an example of the @xmath77 1 case .",
    "dimensionless structure in terms of homology variables can also be derived ( kennedy & bludman 1999 ) .    direct methods of inversion without a reference ssm , based on @xmath0-modes alone and including use of the sound speed slope as a diagnostic of the equation of state , are discussed in the older literature ( gough 1984 ; christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "1985 ; gough & toomre 1991 ; gough et al . 1995 ) and , since the advent of soho , gong , and bison / lowl , by gough et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , basu et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and christensen - dalsgaard ( 1997 ) . since the @xmath20 , especially at long wavelength ,",
    "are affected by the whole sun , errors in the inferred spatial structure are strongly correlated .",
    "an inversion for @xmath28 , like the inversion for @xmath27 , will have uncertainties in both @xmath78 and the position @xmath79 .",
    "the derived profiles  ( 11 ) will have errors compounded from all these sources : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath79 , and thus larger than errors in any one .",
    "as the ssm evolves , @xmath80 falls while @xmath9 increases from zero , the core becoming more concentrated .",
    "helioseismology is adiabatic and non - evolutionary and can not give the thermal or chemical structure without further assumptions or a full ssm .",
    "many ssm core features can be understood via mechanical - thermal core homology without a detailed model ( bludman & kennedy 1996 ) .",
    "homology applied to the _ core only _ is valid for power - law opacity and luminosity generation and does _ not _ require a polytrope .",
    "a polytrope is not even approximately valid for the present ssm core in any case ( kennedy & bludman 1999 ) .",
    "the homology in reality is violated somewhat , as the exponents are not constant and the luminosity is not exclusively produced by one reaction chain .",
    "= @xmath81 and the specific opacity is @xmath82 = @xmath83 , the homology yields @xmath84 ( correcting an error in bludman & kennedy 1996 ) . ] but an accurate thermal and chemical reconstruction is not much less complicated and requires no fewer assumptions than a full ssm .",
    "on the other hand , the mechanical structure of a ssm can be specified by the model - independent reconstruction of section  2 , rather than calculated .    as @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    "are in principle inferable from helioseismology , the numerical precision of the reconstruction can be estimated .",
    "no @xmath1-mode measurements are now available , so the ssm bouyancy frequency is used here .",
    "combining @xmath27 , @xmath59 , and the ssm @xmath28 and assuming @xmath5 = 5/3 , the profile @xmath87 is obtained  ( 9 ) and hence @xmath64 .",
    "figure  1 shows the measured sound speed below the convection zone , the points being fixed by helioseismic inversion ( christensen - dalsgaard 1997 ) .",
    "the bp98 ssm @xmath29 and @xmath78 profiles , respectively , are shown in figs .",
    "2(a , b ) . in figure  3",
    "is displayed the ratio of the reconstructed to the ssm @xmath64 .",
    "the helioseismic inversion points are separated by steps of @xmath88 0.01 , and we should thus expect agreement with the ssm at level of about one percent , consistent with fig .  3 . the inner boundary at @xmath89 = 0.05 marks the terminus of the present helioseismic inversion , the outer boundary the base of the convective zone at @xmath90 = 0.71 .",
    "cutting off the fit at both ends introduces artificial errors , and thus the first three and last three points are not shown in fig .",
    "the agreement of a true reconstruction with the ssm should be better than fig .  3 , but the overall uncertainty would be somewhat larger than a percent , reflecting the @xmath27 uncertainty ; the additional uncertainties due to a measured , rather than a model , @xmath28 profile ; and the errors induced by spatial correlation of the helioseismic inversion mesh points .",
    "some solar core tests are proposed , independent of model details . measured @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes are needed to reconstruct @xmath91 and @xmath92 uniquely and independently of a reference ssm , with only general physical assumptions : hydrostatic equilibrium , the ideal gas law , and known , constant @xmath5 .",
    "absence of core convection implies @xmath93 0 in  ( 2 ) and the existence of @xmath30 for high @xmath14  ( 3 ) .",
    "a non - singular , static mass distribution implies vanishing of the sound speed slope  ( 4 ) at the center  ( 5 ) .",
    "the measured slope and/or high-@xmath14 @xmath23 can set a limit @xmath94 cm sec@xmath58 on a central velocity field .",
    "reconstruction of the solar interior mechanical structure follows  ( 10 - 11 ) from @xmath27 , @xmath59 , and @xmath28 .",
    "a test of the method is presented , using the available , measured @xmath27 and a model @xmath28 profile .",
    "the @xmath95 and @xmath78 profiles to the origin are essential for testing the ssm in the inner core , the critical region for the solar neutrino problem , where the higher - energy be and b neutrinos are produced and where solar structure becomes strongly non - polytropic ( bahcall 1988 ; kennedy & bludman 1999 ) . @xmath0-mode data on a finer radial mesh and extending to the center are presently lacking , but might become available soon , even if @xmath1-mode measurements remain elusive .",
    "truly independent tests of thermal structure and chemical evolution would require comparison with other sun - like stars , in particular via asteroseismology ( deubner et al .",
    "1998 ) . with the appropriate changes ,",
    "the method outlined here can be used to analyze such stars as well .",
