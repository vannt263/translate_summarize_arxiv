    "physically , the longitudinal vibration of the bipyramidal nanoparticle propagates through the shearing motion in the fluid , and hence the effect of fluid compressibility is insignificant .",
    "in contrast , due to the spherical symmetry in the breathing mode of a nanosphere , fluid compressibility plays a more significant role in propagating the energy through acoustic waves .",
    "a viscoelastic response in a fluid triggered by high - frequency vibrations was demonstrated by pelton _",
    "@xcite for a longitudinal vibration of bipyramidal gold nanoparticles , where they observed non - monotonic variations of the quality factor as a function of glycerol mass fraction that were not captured by a newtonian fluid model . motivated by these experimental observations ,",
    "we have extended the classical problem of a radially vibrating elastic sphere in a newtonian fluid to a viscoelastic fluid , modeled as a maxwell fluid . despite the fundamental difference in the vibration mode ,",
    "the breathing mode of a nanosphere , taking into account the relaxation time , also predicts a non - monotonic variation of the quality factor as a function of the glycerol mass fraction , similar to the response of longitudinal vibration of a gold bipyramidal nanoparticle in a maxwell fluid .",
    "a newtonian fluid model fails to capture this non - monotonic behavior . due to the simplicity of the spherical geometry considered in this work ,",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the breathing mode in the viscoelastic fluid medium is exact and analytical .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath11 of water - glycerol mixtures is typically small , on the order of 1100 ps ( table [ table : data_maxwell ] ) ; the viscoelastic response is triggered only when the vibration frequency is sufficiently high such that @xmath148 . for the cases studied in this paper ,",
    "the real part of the vibration frequency can be effectively approximated by the vibration frequency of a sphere in vacuum ( [ eqn : vacuum ] ) , where we solve for @xmath162 for a given ratio of wave speeds in the elastic solid @xmath163 .",
    "one can rewrite the condition @xmath148 as @xmath164 , which leads to the condition @xmath165 , a typical radius of the elastic structure smaller than which the viscoelastic response in the fluid would be triggered . for gold ,",
    "@xmath166 by ( [ eqn : vacuum ] ) , and hence the viscoelastic effect has to be taken into account when the radius of the gold nanosphere is smaller than @xmath167 nm for a water - glycerol mixture with @xmath106 , according to the material properties in tables [ table : parameters ] and [ table : data_maxwell ]",
    ".    we also comment on the idea of destroying virus particles by acoustic resonance ( see introduction ) .",
    "the lifetime ( or damping time , @xmath168 ) of the vibration was used in the literature @xcite to assess the feasibility of the idea .",
    "a major obstacle is the short damping time when the virus particle is embedded in a liquid .",
    "@xcite assuming that the density and elastic properties of viruses were close to that of protein crystals ( lysozyme ) , @xcite the inviscid model by talati and jha @xcite estimated that the damping time for a virus in liquid was of the order of picoseconds .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse wave speeds are @xmath170 m / s and @xmath171 m / s , respectively",
    ". see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ] specifically , for a virus particle of 50 nm radius , talati and jha estimated a damping time of 17.3 ps for a virus - water configuration .",
    "a longer damping time ( 34.4 ps ) was estimated for a virus - glycerol configuration , @xcite leading to a conclusion that this configuration was more favorable than the virus - water configuration for virus destruction .",
    "here we comment on the effect of fluid viscoelasticity on these estimations . for the virus - water configuration ,",
    "the relaxation time of water is small compared with the vibration time scale ( @xmath172 in this case ) , and hence the effect of viscoelasticity is negligible .",
    "however , the viscoelastic effect is significant for the virus - glycerol configuration because the relaxation time of glycerol is comparable to the vibration time scale ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "our calculation shows that the viscoelastic response triggered in glycerol significantly increases the damping time to 111 ps , suggesting a better likelihood of destroying the virus compared with previous estimations .",
    "finally , we note that experimental measurements of the quality factor of nanoparticles are considerably lower than the theoretical predictions .",
    "previous research attributed the discrepancy to other dissipation mechanisms intrinsic to the particle that were not taken into account in the theoretical model , for example , internal friction within the nanoparticle and the dissipation in the capping layer surrounding the nanoparticle .",
    "@xcite theoretical models taking into account these damping mechanisms and other plausible effects , such as the thermo - acoustic effect , are currently under investigation .",
