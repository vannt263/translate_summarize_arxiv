    "studies of single impurities in solids is one of the most rapidly developing fields of experimental physics in recent years  @xcite .",
    "such experiments are attractive since it makes possible to verify the fundamental theoretical approaches that were based on macroscopic measurements . in the field of applied science",
    "a device based on single impurities is the ultimate limit of electronics miniaturization . at present ,",
    "two main techniques are exploited in order to reach a single impurity resolution : scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite and micro - photoluminescence . on the one hand",
    "the optical methods have advantage over tunneling measurements due to absence of the surface influence .",
    "on the other hand the resolution of optical measurements is fundamentally restricted by the diffraction limit .",
    "the photon wavelength has to be smaller than the average distance between impurities .",
    "the band gap of typical semiconductors is about 1@xmath1ev , and therefore the corresponding doping concentration should not exceed @xmath2@xmath3 for 3d or @xmath4@xmath5 for 2d systems .",
    "at present , the spectroscopy of single semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum dots ( qd ) is well developed  @xcite .",
    "the obvious approach is to dope a single qd with an impurity atom .",
    "experiments of this kind were realized for cdte  @xcite and inas  @xcite qds doped with mn .",
    "however , an interpretation of experimental results in qd systems is hampered by the fact that such parameters as a dot size , shape , chemical composition as well as an impurity position inside the qd are randomly distributed across qd ensemble .",
    "it makes necessary to use a lot of additional parameters in the theoretical description of experimental results  @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we study a narrow gaas / algaas qw doped with beryllium in order to optically explore single impurities .",
    "usually , the single emitters in such systems are studied via sub - micron apertures or mesa structures formed on a sample surface  @xcite . to reach the single impurity resolution here",
    ", we do not use any preprocessing of the samples but optimize the doping process instead .",
    "the smallest controllable sheet impurity density in our experiments is about @xmath6@xmath5 .",
    "this number does not meet the diffraction limit condition , but nonetheless can serve a purpose in the same way as was first realized in the spectroscopy of single organic molecules  @xcite .",
    "the point is to put emitters in a media that randomly changes the emitters energy and to employ a spectral resolution in addition to spatial one .",
    "it is well known that fluctuations in a qw width lead to an inhomogeneous spectral broadening of the exciton photoluminescence due to significant variations of the effective bandgap  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the energy broadening corresponds to a gaussian shape of photoluminescence line , let us consider the low - energy tail of spectrum .",
    "for the gaussian distribution a probability that the transition energy is in the range between 2 and 3 standard deviations from the distribution maximum is about 1% . therefore we can reach the necessary small sheet density @xmath4@xmath5 of impurity related single optical emitters , if we examine a lower - energy tail in the photoluminescence of an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of the impurities .",
    "the interface roughness leads to lateral asymmetry and affects the energy structure of excitons  @xcite .",
    "but if a radius of an impurity - bound exciton is smaller than a scale of the roughness , we can neclect the lateral asymmetry and consider such an exciton in a pure 2d environment .",
    "this allows us to significantly reduce the number of fitting parameters in comparison with the case of doped qds  @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : we describe the sample growth , the characterization procedure and micro - photoluminescence data in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii we present a theoretical model of the acceptor - bound exciton which includes the qw confinement .",
    "a comparison of theoretical calculation with obtained and previously published experimental data is discussed in sec .",
    "we grew by molecular beam epitaxy three gaas / al@xmath7ga@xmath8as qw structures with the qw width of 3.7@xmath1 nm and the al content in the barriers x=0.25 .",
    "the samples were doped with be acceptors inside the qw .",
    "they have similar design and differ only in the be doping mode and sheet impurity density , as shown in table 1 . in two samples",
    "the qw is @xmath9-doped in the middle , while in the third we use uniform doping of the qw with 1-ml - thick undoped spacers at both interfaces .",
    "we adjusted the barrier height in order to ensure an effective band - to - band absorption of a pumping light inside the barriers .",

    "the samples were pumped with a 660@xmath1 nm diode laser via an optical fiber with the cross section of 0.1@xmath1mm@xmath18 , macro - luminescence spectra were collected through the same fiber .",
    "we expect that the beryllium dopants reveal itself as an additional low - energy broadening of the qw related photoluminescence line due to an appearance of the acceptor - bound excitons @xcite samples s2 and s3 with more intensive doping indeed demonstrate the expected low - energy broadening as it shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the micro - photoluminescence measurements show that these tails consist of numerous narrow lines . in order to distinguish the micro - photoluminescence lines due to the acceptor - bound excitons from the lines of different origin",

    "figure  2 shows three characteristic spectra which were measured at different spots on the surface of our samples .",
    "the strong photoluminescence line at 1.651.66@xmath1ev corresponds to recombination of excitons inside the qw ( @xmath20 ) and it looks the same for all the samples , while the low - energy side of the spectrum presents a wide variety of results . we observe mostly spectra of type * a ) * on the sample s1 with the lowest doping concentration .",
    "there are no evidences of impurities at the low - energy tail in panel * a)*. the sample s3 shows a strong non - uniformity across the surface : most of the sample surface corresponds to the type * a ) * while less than 10% of the surface gives the spectra of type * c)*. the spectrum in panel * c ) * contains an impurity related luminescence at the low - energy side , but the luminescence lines are quite broad and overlap each other .",

    "if there are any distinctive peculiarities in the micro - photoluminescence spectra , we carry out measurements in the applied magnetic field in faraday geometry . amongst manifold combinations of luminescence lines",
    "we observe a kind of repeating pattern in polarized photoluminescence spectra .",
    "it consists of one strong single luminescence line and two weak adjacent satellites which are split by magnetic field in doublets denoted as ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in fig .",
    "it is noteworthy that a zeeman splitting of the satellites is 1.52 times stronger than a splitting of the main line . in order to give a reliable interpretation of the results we develop a theoretical model of an acceptor - bound exciton in which we take into account an interparticle exchange  @xcite , the qw confinement  @xcite and the magnetic field .",

    "in order to obtain an energy structure of acceptor - bound exciton @xmath0 inside a qw , we use a model hamiltonian :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the hole - hole and the electron - hole exchange energies , respectively , and @xmath25 is a splitting of the localized hole state due to a qw confinement . here",
    "@xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 stand for an angular momentum of the holes and the electron , respectively .",
    "we use a spherical model of the localized hole states @xcite and consider only the ground state with momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the wavefunction of two indistinguishable holes must be antisymmetric , therefore only states with total angular momentum @xmath30 are present . in diamond - like semiconductors",
    "the hole - hole exchange is a ferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath31 ) , therefore a state with the largest total angular momentum is the ground one  @xcite .",
    "the electron - hole exchange interaction between these two holes and the electron with @xmath32 leads to the emergence of a three - particle complex with total angular momentum @xmath33 .",
    "this interaction is also ferromagnetic ( @xmath34 ) in gaas / algaas qws  @xcite ; it means that the `` dark '' state of the free exciton is the ground state .",
    "an energy splitting due to the qw confinement is negative ( @xmath35 ) which corresponds to @xmath36 as a ground hole state .",
    "the order of levels in the bulk @xmath0 complex ( @xmath37 ) depends on the ratio between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we obtain all the three - particle wave functions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 analitically using the usual procedure of angular momentum coupling @xcite . here",

    "we take the electron g - factor @xmath51 , which is true for narrow gaas / algaas qws  @xcite .",
    "zeeman splitting is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a hole g - factor of the initial @xmath0 state .",
    "let us obtain all the g - factors of the acceptor - bound exciton states normalized to the angular momentum 1/2 : @xmath54 the g - factors of mixed states depend on the eigenvector coefficients @xmath55 ( @xmath48 , @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 the final state after the @xmath0 recombination is a neutral acceptor @xmath50 . the final state is also split by the qw potential  @xcite with the same @xmath25 : @xmath58 the four nondegenerate states of @xmath50 produced by a magnetic field are : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a g - factor of the final @xmath50 state .",
    "knowing the energy of the initial @xmath47 and final @xmath61 states we can establish all transition energies as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an effective band gap including all the confinement shifts and the exciton binding energy . in order to obtain oscillator strengths and polarizations of the transitions we use the usual selection rules combined with clebsch - gordan coefficients that couple spins of @xmath0 complex .",
    "figure  [ fig03 ] shows a set of the circularly polarized micro - photoluminescence spectra which were measured at different spots on the sample in applied magnetic field .",
    "as mentioned above , all the spectra match a repetitive pattern : a strong line with two accompanying satellites .",
    "according to our model the strongest photoluminescence lines which are denoted as ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) correspond to transitions @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . the most intense line ( 2 ) originated from the ground @xmath67 state of @xmath0",

    "the dashed arrow marks a forbidden transition , which becomes available if we take into account the cubic anisotropy of the crystal.,width=302 ]    another characteristic feature of our model comes from a fact that a radiative recombination of acceptor - bound exciton occurs via transitions between a multiplet of initials states and only two available final states .",
    "it means that a few pairs of the spectral line with an equal spacing of @xmath25 can be present in the spectrum of the acceptor - bound exciton recombination .",
    "figure  5 depicts an experimental spectrum which contains three pairs with the similar energy splitting of @xmath70mev . assuming that the most intensive line in the spectrum is a @xmath65 transition we successfully describe all other optical transitions using our 3-parameter fit at zero magnetic field . in order to fit the transition intensities",

    "the typical effective temperature of recombining excitons is about @xmath74k in narrow gaas / algaas qws  @xcite in accordance with our results .",
    "we obtain relatively high effective temperature @xmath75k for a couple of measured spectra which means that the local exciton lifetime can be comparable to the time of energy relaxation .",
    "the qw splitting @xmath25 and g - factor of neutral acceptors were directly measured via spin - flip raman scattering  @xcite .",
    "our g - factor values are comparable with those from  @xcite ; the discrepancy is due to using the model fit instead of direct measurement .",
    "we have a good agreement of @xmath25 values with the data from  @xcite if we take into account the strong fluctuation of @xmath25 depending on the acceptor position with respect to the barrier .",
    "such a strong dependance of @xmath25 on @xmath76 coordinate of an individual acceptor makes possible to establish a position of impurity in the growth direction .",
    "lateral coordinates of an impurity in the quantum well could be established within one - nanometer accuracy using super - resolution optical technique which is well developed for the single molecule spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "an application of these methods could provide unprecedented possibilities to establish exact atomic coordinates of impurities inside the crystal lattice and to explore its spin and energy structure , combining advantages of optical spectroscopy with the ultimate spatial accuracy of the scanning tunneling microscopy .",
    "in conclusion , we report photoluminescence measurements of excitons bound to single beryllium acceptors in gaas / algaas qws . in order to describe our results we use a simple theoretical model of an acceptor - bound exciton confined in the qw .",
