    "until some time ago , the only physical system in which the violation of the cp symmetry was observed was the neutral kaon system  @xcite . besides , only the indirect cp violation described by the @xmath2 parameter was measured in that system . only recently , clear evidence for direct cp violation parametrized by the @xmath3 parameter was observed in laboratory  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cp violation in the @xmath4-mesons system has been , finally , observed as well  @xcite .",
    "it is in fact very impressive that all of these observations are accommodated by the electroweak standard model with a complex cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix  @xcite when qcd effects are also included . in the context of that model ,",
    "the only way to introduce cp violation is throughout its hard violation due to complex yukawa couplings , which imply a surviving phase in the charged current coupled to the vector boson @xmath5 in the quark sector . in the neutral kaon system , despite the ckm phase being @xmath6 , the breakdown of that symmetry is naturally small because its effect involves the three quark families at the one loop level  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case of the @xmath4 mesons where the three families are involved even at the tree level and the cp violating asymmetries are @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , if new physics does exist at the tev scale it may imply new sources of cp violation . in this context",
    "the question if the ckm matrix is complex becomes nontrivial since at least part of the cp violation may come from the new physics sector  @xcite .",
    "for instance , even in the context of a model with @xmath7 gauge symmetry , we may have spontaneous cp violation through the complex vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , this is the case of the two higgs doublets extension of the standard model if we do not impose the suppression of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , as in ref .",
    "the cp violation may also arise throughout the exchange of charged scalars if there are at least three doublets and no fcncs  @xcite .",
    "truly soft cp violation may also arise throughout a complex dimensional coupling constant in the scalar potential and with no ckm phase  @xcite .",
    "in fact , all these mechanisms can be at work in multi - higgs extensions of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "hence , in the absence of a general principle , all possible sources of @xmath8 violation must be considered in a given model .",
    "however , it is always interesting to see the potentialities of a given source to explain by itself all the present experimental data .",
    "this is not a trivial issue since , for instance , cp violation mediated by higgs scalars in models without flavor changing neutral currents have been almost ruled out even by old data  @xcite .    among the interesting extensions of the standard model",
    "there are the models based on the @xmath9 gauge symmetry called 3 - 3 - 1 models for short  @xcite .",
    "these models have shown to be very predictive not only because of the relation with the generation problem , some representation content of these models allow three and only three families when the cancellation of anomalies and asymptotic freedom are used ; they also give some insight about the observed value of the weak mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "the 3 - 3 - 1 models are also interesting context in which new theoretical ideas as extra dimensions  @xcite and the little higgs mechanism can be implemented  @xcite .    in the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model  @xcite both mechanisms of cp violation , hard  @xcite and spontaneous  @xcite has been already considered . in this paper",
    "we analyze soft cp violation in the framework of the 3 - 3 - 1 model of ref .",
    "@xcite in which only three triplets are needed for breaking the gauge symmetry appropriately and give mass to all fermions .",
    "although it has been shown that in this model pure spontaneous cp violation is not possible  @xcite , we can still implement soft cp violation if , besides the three scalar vevs , a trilinear parameter in the scalar potential is allowed to be complex . in this case",
    "a physical phase survives violating the cp symmetry .",
    "this mechanism was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite but there a detailed analysis of the cp observables in both kaons and @xmath4-mesons were not given .",
    "here we will show that all the cp violating parameters in the neutral kaon system can be explained through this mechanism leaving the case of the @xmath4-mesons for a forthcoming paper .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : fitting ] , while our conclusions are in the last section . in the appendix",
    "a we write some integrals appearing in box and penguin diagrams .",
    "here we are mainly concerned with the doubly charged scalar and its yukawa interactions with quarks since this is the only sector in which the soft @xmath8 violation arises in this model  @xcite .",
    "the interaction with the doubly charged vector boson will be considered when needed ( sec .",
    "[ sec : epsilon ] ) . as expected",
    ", there is only a doubly charged would be goldstone boson , @xmath10 , and a physical doubly charged scalar , @xmath11 , defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 ; the mass square of the @xmath11 field is given by @xmath14 where we have defined @xmath15 with @xmath16 a complex parameter in the trilinear term @xmath17 of the scalar potential and @xmath18 is the coupling of the quartic term @xmath19 in the scalar potential .",
    "for details and notation see ref .",
    "notice that since @xmath20 , it is @xmath21 which is almost @xmath11 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that all @xmath8 violation effects arise from the singly and/or doubly charged scalar - exotic quark interactions .",
    "notwithstanding , the cp violation in the singly charged scalar is avoided by assuming the total leptonic number l ( or b+l , see below ) conservation and , in this case , only two phases survive after the re - definition of the phases of all fermion fields in the model : a phase of the trilinear coupling constant @xmath16 and the phase of a vacuum expectation value , say @xmath22 . among these phases ,",
    "actually only one survives because of the constraint equation @xmath23 which implies @xmath24 .",
    "let us briefly recall the representation content of the model  @xcite with a little modification in the notation .",
    "in the quark sector we have @xmath25 @xmath26 ; @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the yukawa interactions are written as : @xmath31 where all couplings in the matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 s are in principle complex . although the fields in eq .",

    "we will assume that all the yukawa couplings in eq .",

    "( [ yukawa ] ) , we introduce real and orthogonal left- and right - handed mixing matrices defined as @xmath35 with @xmath36 etc ; the primed fields denote symmetry eigenstates and the unprimed ones mass eigenstates , being the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix defined as @xmath37 .    in terms of the mass eigenstates the lagrangian interaction involving exotic quarks , the known quarks , and doubly charged scalars is given by  @xcite : @xmath38({\\cal o}^d_l ) _ { 3\\alpha } d_{\\alpha } y^{++ } + h.c.~ , \\label{yuka}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the same parameter appearing in eq  ( [ dcf ] ) , i.e. , @xmath40 and now , unlike eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) , all fields are mass eigenstates , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 . in writing the first term of eq.([yuka ] ) we have used @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the diagonal mass matrix in the @xmath46-quark sector and we have omitted the summation symbol in @xmath47 so that @xmath48 .",
    "( [ yuka ] ) contains all cp violation in the quark sector once we have assumed that all the yukawa couplings are real .",
    "unlike in multi - higgs extensions of the standard model  @xcite there is no cabibbo suppression since in this model only one quark , @xmath49 , contributes in the internal line , i.e. , we have the replacement @xmath50 .",
    "notice that in eq .",
    "( [ yuka ] ) the suppression of the mixing angle in the sector of the doubly charged scalars [ see eq .",
    "( [ dcf ] ) ] has been written explicitly .",
    "we will use as illustrative values @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 tev .",
    "in this situation the @xmath8 violation in the neutral kaon system will impose constraints only upon the masses @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and , in principle , on @xmath55 the mass of the doubly charged vector boson .",
    "although @xmath56 has free parameters since the masses @xmath57 are not known , the exotic quarks @xmath58 do not play any role in the cp violation phenomena of @xmath59 mesons .",
    "we should mention that it was implicit in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the conservation of the quantum number b+l defined in refs .",
    "@xcite . only in this circumstance ( or by introducing appropriately a @xmath60 symmetry )",
    "we can avoid terms like @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the left - handed lepton triplet , and the usual right - handed components for usual and exotic leptons .",
    "these interactions imply mixing among the left- and right - handed components of the usual charged leptons with the exotic ones  @xcite .",
    "the quartic term @xmath66 in the scalar potential which would imply cp violation throughout the single charged scalar exchange is also avoided by imposing the b+l conservation . in fact , this model has the interesting feature that when a @xmath60 symmetry is imposed , the peccei - quinn @xmath67 , the total lepton number , and the barion number are all automatic symmetries of the classic lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "first of all let us say that in the present model there are tree level contributions to the mass difference @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 ) .",
    "this is because the existence of the flavor changing neutral currents in the model in both the scalar sector and in the couplings with the @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath71 s contributions to @xmath72 have been considered in ref .  @xcite . for @xmath73",
    "gev the constraint coming from the experimental value of @xmath72 implies @xmath74 .",
    "there are also tree level contributions to @xmath72 coming from the @xmath75 exchange which were considered in ref .",
    "however , since there are 520 diagrams contributing to @xmath72 , we will use in this work the experimental value for this parameter . in this vain _ a priori _ there is no constraints on the matrix elements of @xmath76 .",
    "the definition for the relevant parameters in the neutral kaon system is the usual one  @xcite : @xmath77 , \\quad { \\epsilon}= \\frac{e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left [ \\frac{{\\rm i m } a_{0}}{{\\rm re } a_{0 } } + \\frac{{\\rm i m } m_{12}}{\\delta m_k } \\right ] , \\label{que}\\ ] ] we shall use the @xmath78 rule for the nonleptonic decays which implies that @xmath79 and that the phase @xmath80 is determined by hadronic parameters following ref .  @xcite and",
    "it is , therefore , model independent .",
    "the @xmath2 parameter has been extensively measured and its value is reported to be  @xcite @xmath81 more recently , the experimental status for the @xmath82 ratio has stressed the clear evidence for a non - zero value and , therefore , the existence of direct cp violation .",

    "the main @xmath95 contribution for the @xmath85 parameter comes from the gluonic penguin diagram in fig.1 that exchanges a doubly charged scalar .",
    "the electroweak penguin is suppressed as in the sm and will not be considered .",
    "on the other hand the @xmath96 and @xmath8 violating parameter @xmath84 has only contributions coming from box diagrams involving two doubly charged scalars @xmath11 ( see fig.2a ) and box diagrams involving one doubly charged scalar and one vector boson @xmath97 ( see fig.2b ) .",

    "one of the features of this model is that there is no gim mechanism since the only cp violation source comes from the vertices involving a @xmath46-type quark , an exotic quark , and a single doubly charged scalar .",

    "for instance using @xmath161 ( i. e. , @xmath162 ) we found @xmath163 and @xmath164 , for @xmath165 we obtain @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "notice that from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we see that we have solution in the range @xmath168 .",
    "the study showed that the 3 - 3 - 1 model considered here can account for the direct and indirect cp violation present in the @xmath169 system for sensible values of the unknown parameters . within the approximations",
    "used , @xmath170 there are infinitely many possible values for @xmath158 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 allowed by the experimental data .",
    "although they are not all independent and the constraint @xmath173 implies a very small upper bound for the ratio @xmath172 . such bound becomes smaller as @xmath39 becomes greater .",
    "thus very large values of @xmath39 leads to unrealistically small values of the ratio .",
    "notice also that the constraints used in eq .",
    "( [ fit1 ] ) are very strong .",
    "however , weaker constraints arise if a detailed analysis which take into account the experimental error in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 is done . of course",
    ", it is clear that in this case there will exist a solution as well .",
    "the model implies also some contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) as in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath174\\;\\textrm{e}\\,\\textrm{cm } ,   \\label{edmn}\\ ] ] and we see that a value compatible with the experimental bound of  @xcite @xmath175 is obtained for practically any value of the phase @xmath34 , if @xmath176 .",
    "the edm of the charged leptons also produces results compatible with the experimental limit for a large range of the parameters of the model .",
    "in addition this model allow magnetic dipole moments for massive neutrinos in the range @xmath177 almost independently of the neutrino mass  @xcite which is near the experimental upper limit for the electron neutrino magnetic moment  @xcite @xmath178    moreover , as in the standard model the lepton charge asymmetry in the @xmath179 decay , @xmath180 , which has the experimental value ( the weighted average of @xmath181 and @xmath182  @xcite ) @xmath183 , is also automatically fitted in the present model because @xmath184 is still valid .",
    "recent analysis on cp violation indicate that the phase of the ckm matrix , which is @xmath6 , is the dominant contribution to the cp violation in both @xmath59 and @xmath4 mesons so , new phases coming from physics beyond the standard model must be small perturbations .",
    "the ckm mechanism is also at work in the present model but we switch it off in order to study the possibilities of the extra phase of the model .",
    "concerning the @xmath59 meson and edm for elementary particles it seems that the model do well .",
    "presently we are working out the case of @xmath4 decays , if the model is not able to fit these data it implies that ckm phase must be switched on .",
    "it is still possible that new phases may be at work if decays based on @xmath185 gluonic dominated transition really need new physics  @xcite . any way , the extra phase in the model could be important for other cp violation parameters like the edm or , if new cp violation observables in @xmath4-mesons will not be fitted by the cmk mechanism .    finally , some remarks concerning the masses of the extra particles in 3 - 3 - 1 models .",
    "firstly , let us consider the @xmath75 vector boson it contributes to the @xmath72 at the tree level so that there is a constraint over the quantity  @xcite @xmath186 which must be of the order of @xmath187 to have compatibility with the measured @xmath72 .",
    "this can be achieved with @xmath188 tev if we assume a fritzsch - structure @xmath189 or , since there is no _ a priori _ reason for @xmath76 having the fritzsch - structure , it is possible that the product of the mixing angles saturates the value @xmath187  @xcite , in this case @xmath75 can have a mass near the electroweak scale . however , in 3 - 3 - 1 models there are flavor changing neutral currents in the scalar sector implying new contributions to @xmath72 which are of the form @xmath190 that involve the mass of the scalar @xmath191 , the unknown matrix elements @xmath192 and also the yukawa coupling @xmath193 , so their contributions to @xmath72 can have opposite sing relative to that of the @xmath75 contribution .",
    "this calculation has not been done in literature , where only the later contribution has been taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the model has also doubly charged scalars that are important in the present cp violating mechanism .",
    "the lower limit for the mass of doubly charged scalars is a little bit above 100 gev  @xcite . concerning the doubly charged vector boson ,",
    "if they have masses above 500 gev they can be found ( if they really do exist ) by measuring left - right asymmetries in lepton - lepton scattering  @xcite .",
    "fermion pair production at lep , and lepton flavor violating of the charged leptons suggest a low bound of 750 gev for the @xmath194 mass  @xcite . in @xmath195 , @xmath196 colliders the detection of bileptons with masses between 500 gev and 1 tev  @xcite is favored , while if their masses are of the order of @xmath197  1  tev they could be also observed at hadron colliders like lhc @xcite .",
    "muonium - antimuonium transitions would imply a lower bound of 850 gev on the masses of the doubly charged gauge bileptons , @xmath194  @xcite .",
    "however this bound depends on assumptions on the mixing matrix in the lepton charged currents coupled to @xmath194 and also it does not take into account that there are in the model doubly charged scalar bileptons which also contribute to that transition  @xcite .",
    "the muonium fine structure only implies @xmath198 gev assuming only the vector bilepton contributions  @xcite . concerning the exotic quark masses , there is no lower limit for their masses but if they are in the range of 200 - 600 gev they may be discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "search for free stable color triplets quarks has been carried out in @xmath199 collider at an energy of 1.8 gev excluding these particles in the range 50 - 139 gev , 50 - 116 gev and 50 - 140 gev , for the electric charges of @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that the masses for the extra degrees of freedom which distinguish 3 - 3 - 1 models with respect to the standard model may be accessible at the energies of the colliders of the next generations .",
    "this work was partially supported by cnpq under the processes 141874/03 - 1 ( ccn ) , 305185/03 - 9 ( jcm ) and 306087/88 - 0 ( vp ) and by fapesp ( mcr and or ) .",
