    "the result for the a2e correction can be obtained in the following way .",
    "we consider the one  loop vacuum polarization insertion into a 2-photon annihilation diagram ( fig .",

    "the vacuum polarization insertion normally fixes a gauge ( the landau gauge ) for the virtual photon , because the polarization insertion is proportional to the transverse projector .",

    "one of the ways to investigate the hyperfine structure of @xmath3 or @xmath4 states could be based on the observation of the interference between paradimuonium and orthodimuonium in an infrared frequency field at resonance ( the radiofrequency field would mix the two states and thus yield a modified decay rate of the statistical sample ) .",
