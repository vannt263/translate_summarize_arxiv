    "the study of quantum chaos in many - body problems using the random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite is now an established field of research in physics @xcite .",
    "it is known that the statistical properties of a quantum many - body system which follow the predictions of rmt have chaotic behaviour in the classical phase space @xcite .",
    "this behaviour of a quantum many - body system was first observed for the neutron resonance states of compound nuclei @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the fluctuation properties of the neutron resonance states follow the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) statistics which is one of universal classes of rmt .",
    "the statistical analysis of the nuclear states which are populated through @xmath0-decay has also been performed @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated using different theoretical approaches that at low - excitation energies the statistical analysis depicts a poissonian distribution which corresponds to underlying regular classical motion .",
    "however , at high - excitation energy the distribution follows the goe statistics , implying that the underlying classical motion is chaotic .",
    "this correlation between the statistical distribution and the classical motion has been obtained for a large class of physical systems @xcite .",
    "however , the important question in the study of quantum chaos , which has remained largely unanswered , is : _ what are the consequences of quantum chaos in measurable quantities _ ?",
    "it has recently been demonstrated @xcite that , in a nuclear system , the overlap - integral between the wave functions of the neighbouring rotational states can provide a measure of the degree of chaoticity . however , the overlap - integral is not directly a measurable quantity .",
    "what is needed to be calculated is the electromagnetic - transitions between the two states . in the previous work @xcite ,",
    "the cranking mean - field model was used to calculate the overlaps .",
    "the cranking wave function does not have a well - defined angular momentum , and in principle , is not appropriate to study the electromagnetic transition probabilities . in order to avoid any errors due to usage of mean - field approximation , in the present work",
    ", we have developed a particle - rotor model ( prm ) approach in which angular momentum is strictly conserved .",
    "we would like to use the prm wave functions to study the consequences of the chaotic motion on the electromagnetic transitions .",
    "it should be mentioned that the question of rotational damping has also been addressed recently by other authors @xcite and it has been shown that the phenomenon of rotational damping observed in deformed nuclei is a possible manifestation of quantum chaos . in these analysis",
    ", the rotational bands were obtained as the intrinsic excitations of a cranked - nilsson mean - field potential . in order to obtain the rotational damping ,",
    "the bands were mixed using a two - body residual interaction . since in the cranked mean - field approaches , as already mentioned , angular momentum is not a conserved quantity , these calculations are suitable for very high - spin states for which cranking becomes a good approximation to the angular momentum projection method .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to present an alternative analysis of the rotational damping using the particle - rotor model .",
    "pairing is explicitly included in the present calculations and , therefore , the results discussed are applicable to all the spin regimes .",
    "furthermore , we use the same hamiltonian for obtaining the bands structures as well as the rotational damping . in the earlier studies @xcite ,",
    "the nilsson potential was used to obtain the intrinsic bands and the rotational damping was then calculated with a residual two - body interaction .    the exact analysis in the prm limits the configuration space that can be employed in the numerical studies .",
    "therefore , we shall work in a model space of a deformed single - j shell as has been done in the earlier studies @xcite .",
    "this would imply that our results can not be compared directly with the experimental data .",
    "the main essence of the present work would be to draw a connection between the mechanism of rotational damping and the chaotic features in an exactly soluble model .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in the next section , we give some relevant details of the prm .",
    "the prm is a standard model and the discussion of this approach can be found in the textbooks , for example in ref .",
    "we shall , therefore , only give the relevant expressions for the quantities which are used in the present work .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "finally , the present study is summarized in section iv .",
    "the basic philosophy of the prm @xcite is to consider the nucleus as a core with a few valance particles . in most of the cases ,",
    "the core is assumed to be inert with fixed properties .",
    "the hamiltonian of the prm is written as the rotor plus the particle part    @xmath1    with @xmath2 the quantity @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) is the moment of inertia of the core and @xmath4 is the angular momentum of the core . in the present work",

    "@xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) can be explicitly rewritten as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total angular momentum and @xmath8 is the angular momentum of the valance particles .",
    "the particle part of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is given by @xmath9    the strength of the two - body interaction is @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted that the delta - interaction used in the present work has predominant pairing properties .",
    "however , since we solve the two - body interaction exactly , it will contribute to both pairing or particle - particle channel as well as to the particle - hole channel .",
    "the deformation energy @xmath11 is related to the deformation parameter @xmath12 through @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the harmonic oscillator frequency of the deformed potential and @xmath15 the quantum number of the major shell . for the case of @xmath16 shell",
    ", @xmath11=2.5 approximately corresponds to @xmath17 .",

    "the statistical analysis has also been studied for three more sets of eigen - values .",
    "instead of choosing the energy window , we have considered the number of eigen - values , since the number of states in a given energy window change as a function of angular momentum and deformation .",
    "furthermore , in order to have a reasonable statistics we have chosen 400 eigen - values in each bin .",
    "the results of the analysis with eigen - values ranging from 1 to 400 are shown by upper triangles and the third set with eigen - values from 401 to 800 are shown by lower triangles in figs . 1 and 2",

    "1 indicates that at low - spin values of i = 10 and 12 , @xmath46 values closely follow the curve expected for the goe distribution .",
    "it is noted that the goe statistics is obtained at all excitation energies .",
    "therefore , the classical motion is fully chaotic for low - spin values . for high angular momenta close to i = 60",
    ", the results with all the eigen - values deviate from the goe curve and , therefore , indicating that the underlying classical motion is less chaotic .",
    "however , the results also show that the motion becomes more chaotic at higher excitation energies .",
    "the @xmath46 values for the set 401 - 801 eigen - values , shown by lower triangles , are more close to the curve expected for the chaotic motion .",
    "the generic property that the system tends to become regular with increasing angular momenta is a consequence @xcite of the decoupling of the particle spins from the deformation axis of the rotor . as the nuclear system rotates faster",
    ", more and more particles tend to align their spins along the same direction of the rotation axis , which causes the system to become more regular .",
    "the results for the intermediate spin values of i = 30 and 32 appear slightly less chaotic as compared to i = 10 and 12 , when considering all the eigen - values , but are similar to low - spin values at higher excitation energies .    in fig .",

    "the results appear to be similar to those of fig",
    ". 1 .      at low excitation energies , the e2 transition from a given state populates one particular state at a lower - spin",
    "however , at high - excitation energies , it is known that a given state populates several states .",
    "this fragmentation of the e2 strength is referred to as the rotational damping .",
    "it has been shown using the cranking model that the onset of rotational damping at a given excitation energy is related to the underlying chaotic motion @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we shall also try to investigate this relationship .    in order to evaluate rotational damping , the b(e2 ) values",
    "have been calculated for a range of initial and final states .",
    "we considered three sets of initial states , which represent the three energy sets considered in the statistical analysis of the eigen - values in figs . 1 and 2",
    ". the three sets of initial states considered are : ( a ) from 1 to 50 , ( b ) from 275 to 325 and ( c ) from 575 to 625 .",
    "the decay of each of these initial states has been calculated to all the final states at a lower - spin . in figs .",
    "3 and 4 , the results of b(e2 ) values , for the normal deformation value of @xmath35 mev , are plotted for three initial states of 26 , 300 and 600 as a representative examples of the above three chosen sets . in the evaluation of the b(e2 ) value from eq .",
    "( [ rme ] ) , the quadrupole - moment of the core , @xmath30 , needs to be specified . in order to study the core dependence of the rotational damping , two sets of calculations",
    "have been carried out - one with no core quadrupole - moment and the other with a @xmath48 barn .",
    "the results of these two sets are shown in figs .",
    "3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the results of the b(e2 ) for @xmath49 depict a peak value at around the final state @xmath50 , with very small contribution from the neighboring final states . for the initial state of @xmath51 , the b(e2 ) is very fragmented ; there are many states to which this state decays into . for the initial state of @xmath52 ,",
    "the fragmentation is even higher . on comparing the results of three transitions of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in fig .",
    "1 , it is noted that the degree of fragmentation decreases with increasing angular momentum .",

    "( [ rme ] ) , since for the core contribution only the diagonal term for which @xmath57 contributes .",
    "the fragmentation arises from the terms of the intrinsic quadrupole operator ( @xmath58 ) of eq .",
    "( [ rme ] ) , which mix different k - components in the intrinsic wave function .",
    "the results for @xmath47 mev are shown in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "5 presents the results with no core quadrupole moment and fig .",
    "6 depicts the results with @xmath59 barn . at low excitation energies ,",
    "it is noted from fig .",
    "5 that the fragmentation is reduced as compared to fig . 3 , but at higher excitation energies the results for the two deformation values are very similar . this observation is consistent with that obtained with the statistical analysis .",
    "the results of fig . 6 with core quadrupole moment , @xmath59 barn , show that fragmentation is substantially reduced for most of the cases .",
    "chaos is expected to set in when the average level distance is of the order of the coupling matrix elements @xcite . in a model study with a limited model space and",
    "effective interactions which depend on parameters , it is instructive to study the density of states as a function of excitation energy and angular momentum , and the interplay of the density of states and the residual interactions in the determination of the chaotic motion .    in fig .",
    "7 , the density of states is plotted by counting energy levels in an energy window of 1 mev for each excitation energy .",
    "all the levels generated in the present model space are included , without any truncation .",
    "the density is shown for three angular momenta @xmath60 10 , 30 , and 60 , and for the two deformation values of @xmath45 and 6.0 mev .",
    "the curves for the normally deformed case with @xmath45 show a significantly decreasing trend when angular momentum increases . for the superdeformed case with @xmath61 ,",
    "the decreasing trend is not as pronounced as the normal deformed case . however ,",
    "a drop at @xmath62 is still clearly seen . comparing the results for the two deformations , we see that for the superdeformed case , the density of states is much smaller .",
    "this is particularly true for @xmath63 10 and 30 .",
    "if the density of states decreases with deformation , a larger residual interaction would be needed to obtain a similar amount of fragmentation in e2 strength .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate situations in the superdeformed case , but with enhanced interactions . in figs . 8 and 9 , the same calculations presented in figs .",
    "5 and 6 are repeated by using a larger residual interaction .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ residual ] ) is enhanced by a factor of 2 .",
    "it can be seen that with the enhanced interaction , a stronger fragmentation is now obtained .",
    "the superdeformed results with enhanced interaction ( figs . 8 and 9 ) seem to approach the normally deformed results with the ordinary interaction ( figs . 3 and 4 ) .",

    "( [ be2 ] ) and ( 9 ) .",
    "in order to evaluate @xmath65 , it is required to calculate the b(e2 ) transition from one particular state to all the states which are allowed by the selection rules of the @xmath68ray radiation . considering a case where it decays to only one state ( as is true at low - excitation energy ) ,",
    "@xmath65 is equal to one if the b(e2 ) s are normalized . for the case",
    "where a given state decays to two possible states with equal probabilities , @xmath65 is equal to 2 .",
    "this implies that for @xmath65 less than 2 , the band structure is discrete and each given state decays only to one state at a lower excitation energy .",
    "@xmath65 greater than 2 corresponds to rotational damping , signifying that b(e2 ) transition strength from a given state populates two or more states at a lower spin .",
    "the branching parameter @xmath65 for @xmath35 mev is presented in table i for a range of initial states . in order to avoid local fluctuations ,",
    "the @xmath65 value has been calculated by averaging over the neighboring states . in table",
    "i , the number @xmath69 in the first column , for example , indicates that @xmath65 has been calculated by averaging over the initial eigen - states from 1 to 10 .",
    "of course , all possible final states have been used to calculate @xmath65 from each initial state before averaging .    the second column of table i gives the results of @xmath65 for the transition @xmath53 .",
    "it is observed from table i that @xmath65 with no core quadrupole moment becomes greater than 2 even at a very low excitation energy and increases with increasing excitation energy .",
    "for the case with a core quadrupole moment , @xmath56 barn , there is no damping at low - excitation energy and @xmath65 increases very slowly as compared to the case with no quadrupole moment .",
    "this suppression of the rotational damping with a core contribution indicates that the damping is essentially determined by the contribution of valence particles .    for the second set of initial states from @xmath70 to 324 ,",
    "the value of @xmath65 has now increased to more than 100 and for the third set of states from @xmath71 to 625 , @xmath65 has increased further . in general",
    ", we note that @xmath65 increases with increasing excitation energy .",
    "however , for the case @xmath72 , @xmath65 has in fact decreased .",
    "this drop in @xmath65 can be understood from the fact that the present model space is finite , and as we reach the top of the shell , the level density decreases @xcite . in a realistic model",
    ", the level density should increase with increasing excitation energy .    in the third column of table i ,",
    "@xmath65 is given for the transition @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath65 is now reduced as compared to the transition @xmath74 . in the last column ,",
    "the results are presented for the transition @xmath75 .",
    "the numbers are now considerably reduced . for the results with a core quadrupole moment , @xmath56",
    ", rotational damping is completely absent at low excitation energy , @xmath65 is less than 2 for almost all the first set of states .",
    "the results of the rotational damping for @xmath11 = 6 mev are presented in table ii for the three transitions as studied for @xmath11 = 2.5 mev . for the transition @xmath53 the damping",
    "is observed at a higher excitation energy . for the transitions @xmath73 and @xmath76 , the results appear to be similar to table i. these findings are consistent with the conclusion drawn in the previous figures .",
    "our calculations with enhanced interaction strength for @xmath11 = 6 mev clearly indicate an increased damping .",
    "for example , the branching numbers @xmath65 averaged for the initial eigen - states from 41 to 50 in the transition of @xmath77 were 6.83 when @xmath78 , and 1.50 when @xmath79 ( see table ii ) . with enhanced interaction",
    ", they increase to 8.20 and 1.65 , respectively .",
    "in the present study , we tried to address a fundamental issue on the _ observable consequences of quantum chaos in rotating nuclei_. it is now well accepted that the statistical analysis of a quantum many - body system can provide the important information on the underlying motion . in case that the statistical distribution follows goe statistics , the underlying motion is considered to be chaotic , and for the case where the statistical distribution is poissonian , the underlying motion is regarded to be regular .",
    "this statistical distribution has been studied for a wide range of physical systems . for the case of rotating nuclei",
    ", it is known that at low - excitation energy , the motion is regular , but with increasing excitation energy the motion tends to become chaotic .",
    "the angular momentum dependence of the statistical distribution has also be studied and it has been shown that for low angular momenta , the distribution follows goe and for higher angular momenta the distribution is poissonian .    the important issue that needs to be explored is what observable quantities will be sensitive to the changes in the underlying motion of a physical system .",

    "we consider that it is important to make an exact study since any approximation may lead to different errors in the calculation of the rotational damping and the statistical distributions .",
    "consequently , it may not be possible to make a comparison of the two calculated quantities in an accurate manner .    to summarize , in the present work ,",
