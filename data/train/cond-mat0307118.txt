    "the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations in antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin-1/2 systems in two dimensions ( d ) has attracted much experimental and theoretical attention in past years . in particular ,",

    "approaches predict then a valence bond crystal ( vbc ) phase , with long range order ( lro ) of singlet entities ( dimers , plaquettes of resonnating dimers ... ) and thus breaking translational symmetry and/or others space symmetries , if the transition out of the nel phase is continuous  @xcite .",
    "numerical results obtained from exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies support this prediction for several models : the @xmath8 model on the honeycomb lattice  @xcite and some models where the spins sit on a square lattice such as the crossed chain model  @xcite and the quadrumerized shastry - sutherland model  @xcite .

    "[ fig_exchanges ] where the @xmath1 model corresponds to @xmath11 ) , the validity of this scenario remain unclear  @xcite .",
    "its classical ground - state has @xmath12 nel lro for @xmath13 and is the degenerate manifold corresponding to two decoupled nel states on interpenetrating square lattices for @xmath14 .",
    "there is a large consensus that @xmath12 nel lro ( see fig .  [ types_neel ] ) survives to quantum fluctuations for @xmath15 and quantum fluctuations select either a @xmath16 or a @xmath17 nel state in the manifold of classical ground - states for @xmath18 , whereas , in the intermediate range @xmath19 between these two gapless states , there is a phase without nel lro gapped to spin excitations .",
    "the transition out of the @xmath12 nel phase is second order while the transition out of the @xmath16 nel phase has been predicted to be of first order  @xcite but may be close to second order  @xcite .    whether this intermediate phase has vbc lro or is some resonnating valence bond ( rvb ) phase which do not break any space symmetries , i.e. a spin - liquid , is debated .",
    "earliest investigations , from ed calculations on samples up to @xmath20 spins , have shown enhanced columnar dimer - dimer correlations in this intermediate region , but the finite - size scaling of the order parameter for the columnar vbc lro of dimers , shown in fig .",

    "dimer series expansions , however , were in favor of vbc lro : earliest studies favored columnar lro  @xcite while latter calculations have lead to propose the occurence of two different vbc phases : the columnar dimer phase for @xmath21 and a columnar dimer phase with plaquette type modulation , as shown in fig .",

    "these authors suggest either a spin - liquid or , possibly , the columnar state but with a weak order parameter@xcite yet , as the monte carlo calculations and the series expansions start from some trial state which may bias the results and involve approximations which are not fully under control , while ed calculations which were performed on samples having different lattice symmetries and display irregular finite size scaling , the nature of the ground - state in the intermediate region remain an open question . in this paper , motivated by a recent paper of nersesyan and tsvelik  @xcite , refered as ( nt ) in the following ,",
    "we attempt to shed light on this issue from ed calculations on a spatially anisotropic version of the @xmath1 model with two different nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "the hamiltonian of this @xmath0 model ( named the confederate flag model by nt ) reads : @xmath26 %   ---------                   \\,j\\,{\\bf s}_{l , m}.{\\bf s}_{l+1,m } \\,+\\ ,                   \\,j'\\,{\\bf s}_{l , m}.{\\bf s}_{l , m+1 } \\,+\\ , \\nonumber \\\\                 & \\,j_2\\ , ( { \\bf s}_{l , m}.{\\bf s}_{l+1,m+1 } \\,+\\ ,                             { \\bf s}_{l , m}.{\\bf s}_{l+1,m-1 } ) \\ , ] \\label{eq - heis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which may also be viewed as an array of @xmath27 spin chains of lenght @xmath28 , if @xmath29 .",

    "all exchanges are assumed positive , describing af couplings . for @xmath32",
    "one recovers the @xmath1 model .",

    "the classical ground - state of the @xmath0 model is rather similar to the one of the @xmath1 model . when @xmath29 , one has @xmath12 nel lro if @xmath35 , @xmath16 nel lro if @xmath36 and the ( horizontal ) @xmath30 chains are decoupled if @xmath37 . for @xmath38 ,",

    "numerical studies  @xcite based on the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method or monte carlo approaches have shown that the @xmath27-leg unfrustrated ladders ( @xmath44 ) display a behavior analogeous to a @xmath45-spin chain  @xcite , being fully gapped if @xmath27 is even and gapless if @xmath27 is odd .",
    "so @xmath12 nel lro only occurs in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "the effect of frustration has been especially investigated theoretically and numerically for the @xmath47-leg ladder ( see ref  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these studies have concluded that one has two phases separated by a transition line which has been found to coincide with the line of maximum frustration where the energy per spin reaches its maximum , noted @xmath48 in the following for all values of the number of chains .",
    "this line starts as @xmath49 for @xmath50 and bend slightly with increasing @xmath31 so that @xmath51 at @xmath52  @xcite ( as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] ) .",
    "if @xmath53 one has the haldane phase , where the two spins on a rung tend to be in a triplet state , so named as it contains the point @xmath54 whose low - energy spectrum is similar to that of a spin-1 heisenberg chain . if @xmath55 on has the so called singlet phase , so called as it contains the case @xmath56 with @xmath44 , where the ground - state consists of singlets on each rung .",
    "as shown by white  @xcite the singlet phase is also an haldane phase with diagonally situated next - nearest neigbor spins coupling to form an effective @xmath57 .",
    "both phases have a topological order , breaking a hidden @xmath58 symmetry , which can be measured by non - local string order parameters , similar to the string order parameter of the @xmath57 heisenberg chain .",
    "the two phases are fully gapped like the @xmath57 chain  @xcite , and have a non degenerate singlet ground - state .",
    "these ground - states become degenerate on the transition line @xmath48 .",
    "the nature of the transition has been debated . in a dmrg study  @xcite it was predicted that the transition line would be gapless for @xmath9 lower than @xmath59 .",
    "but more recent dmrg calculations  @xcite have concluded that a gap subsits between the two - fold degenerate ground - state and the excited states for all @xmath60 .",
    "so the transition is 1th order on the whole line @xmath48 in agreement with bosonization results in the limit of vanishing interchain coupling  @xcite .",
    "the elementary excitations then consist of gapped deconfined spin-1/2 spinons which may be viewed as kinks interpolating between the two ground - states  @xcite .",
    "note that these results imply that the classical behavior of independent chains on the line @xmath37 is then destabilized by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the single heisenberg chain is gapless . the spectrum of two independent chains too .",
    "the existence of a finite gap excludes such a behavior .",
    "a dmrg study of the three - leg frustrated ladder with open boundary conditions in the transverse direction  @xcite has shown that this system exhibit two phases separated by a transition line also coincident with the line of maximum frustration @xmath48 and which is a curve quasi identical to the one found for the 2-leg ladders .",
    "the phases are analogeous to those of the 2-leg ladders .",
    "the small @xmath9 phase , which is the phase of the unfrustrated ladder , show a tendency of the three spins on a vertical line to pair in a state of minimum spin whereas they tend to pair in a state of maximum spin in the large @xmath9 phase , which is equivalent to the spin-3/2 chain . on the transition line a bosonization study at weak interchain coupling",
    "@xcite has predicted that the ground - state is a chiral spin - liquid .",
    "recently nt , using an approach based on the bosonization method , investigated the crossover from finite @xmath27 to @xmath46 in the @xmath0 model on the line @xmath61 , in the limit of small interchain coupling ( @xmath62 ) and predicted that the classical behavior of independent chains is unstable to a special rvb ( spin - liquid ) state which may be a realization of the chiral @xmath63-flux rvb state  @xcite .",
    "its ground - state has a @xmath64 degeneracy , for @xmath27 even and transverse periodic boundary conditions , associated to the breaking of a local @xmath65 symmetry , present in the bosonised version of the model , corresponding to the invariance under independent translations by one lattice spacing along individual chains .",
    "each ground - state may be caracterized by different values of a set of non - local order parameters .",
    "these non - local order parameters correlate spins on two adjacent chains whereas different pairs of chains are uncorrelated .",
    "the elementary excitations consist of deconfined spin-1/2 spinons interpolating between different ground - states .",
    "these excitations are either gapless , as predicted for some values of the number of chains , such as @xmath66 , or gapped , as for the @xmath47-leg ladder ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "[ h ]    two questions then arise .",
    "first , does the state predicted by nt extends outside the range of small interchain coupling .",
    "second , what is the nature of the behavior in its vicinity , in particular for the case of an infinite number of chains .",
    "below we report results of ed calculations of @xmath67 spins for @xmath68 to shed light on these questions and more generally the phase diagram of the @xmath0 model .",
    "we shall consider only the case of an even number of chains .",
    "the ed calculations have been carried out on samples of @xmath67 spins in @xmath27 chains of lenghts @xmath28 with periodic boundary conditions both along and perpendicular to the chains : samples of 4 chains with @xmath69 spins and 6 chains with @xmath70 spins .",
    "additional calculations were also performed for the @xmath43 ladder for @xmath71 in order to compare with the @xmath72 results .",
    "contrary to the samples considered in previous ed calculations for the @xmath1 model , all samples have translation vectors parallel to the basis vectors of the square lattice which leads to a regular evolution of the properties with increasing @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",

    "on the other hand , a columnar vbc lro with plaquette modulation , which would lead to an additional translational symmetry breaking in the vertical direction , appears also unlikely for @xmath269 in view of the pattern of dimer - dimer correlations and the fact that the gap @xmath191 to the singlet state @xmath182 with wave - vector @xmath17 is finite .",

    "the state for @xmath274 could however differs from the state for @xmath272 by some non - local order parameter similar to those of the singlet state and the haldane state of the two - leg ladder as conjectured at the end of sec .",
    "iv for the phases at finite @xmath42 on both sides of the intermediate region .",
    "exact diagonalization calculations provide support that the rvb behavior predicted by nersesyan and tsvelik in the @xmath0 model at @xmath275 may be realized and extends along a curve coincident with the line of maximum frustration @xmath85 where it subsists up to large interchain coupling for an even number @xmath27 of chains of lenght @xmath74 .",
    "the line @xmath85 is the analogue of the transition line @xmath61 in the classical model on which the chains decouples .",
    "the independent chain behavior appears destabilized by quantum fluctuations .",

    "this region of columnar order will have a finite width as soon as @xmath194 and extends on both sides of @xmath85 up to a value of @xmath31 close but smaller than @xmath30 for finite @xmath27 , that increase with @xmath27 and approach @xmath32 for @xmath131 .",
    "it separates two phases that are fully gapped haldane like phases for finite @xmath27 and evolves respectivelly to the @xmath12 and @xmath16 nel phases for @xmath46 .",
    "the haldane like phases have probably a topological order .",
    "its nature for @xmath42 deserves further investigation .",
    "the occurence of a columnar order for @xmath31 smaller than @xmath30 , next to the nel phase , agrees with the scenario deduced from large-@xmath7 approaches that valence bond crystal order is expected after the destabilization of a collinear af nel phase .",
    "it is possible that the columnar order may extend for @xmath4 if @xmath131 and that this scenario may be realized also in the @xmath1 model which corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath0 model in the intermediate region for @xmath4 requires nonetheless further study to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "the exact diagonalization method is limited to systems of small sizes .",
    "the extrapolations to the infinite lenght limit are affected by uncertainities .",
    "indeed , some one dimensional systems requires data at very large lenghts to allow a reliable extrapolation to the infinite lenght limit . for certain systems",
    "there may be a crossover in the scaling behavior of the gaps at a very large lenght as shown for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite where some gaps do not decrease monotonicaly with the lenght beyond a certain lenght . for the present model",
    "we have assumed a monotonicaly decreasing smooth evolution of the gaps with increasing lenght .",
    "the assumption appears reasonable in view of the data available at large lenghts in the case of two chains ( the 2-leg ladder ) . yet ,",
    "a small change in the evolution of the gaps at very large lengths is not to be excluded for those gaps that appear to extrapolate to vanishing or quasi vanishing values .",
    "the scaling behavior of the gaps to the low lying excited states as a function of the number of chains deserves further studies .",
    "in particular , calculations using an approach that can deal with very large systems , like possibly the dmrg method , would be worth to firmly establish wether the gaps that have been conjectured to extrapolate to zero really vanish or are just small but finite in the thermodynamic limit and thus check the exact degeneracy of the ground state on the line of maximum frustration .",
    "this study was limited to the case of af couplings . yet",
    ", the @xmath0 model with af intrachain coupling ( @xmath276 ) , but interchain couplings ( @xmath277 ) that are either or both ferromagnetic ( fm ) is also of interest  @xcite .",

    "classically , the ground - state of the @xmath0 model remains af for @xmath278 and @xmath279 ( if @xmath79 ) .",
    "it is the @xmath12 nel state for @xmath280 , the @xmath16 nel state for @xmath281 , and the @xmath30 chains stay decoupled for @xmath61 .",
    "the spin-1/2 , 2-leg ladder ( with fm @xmath31 and/or @xmath9 ) has been studied by bosonization  @xcite and drmg  @xcite calculations .",
    "these studies showed that the singlet and haldane phases extends for @xmath282 , separated by a transition line which is the continuation of the boundary line for @xmath283 .",
    "this transition line is also the line of the points of maximum frustration @xmath85 .",
    "the transition line , however , does not deviate from the classical boundary line @xmath61 and the transition appears to be 2nd order for @xmath284 , instead of 1th order for @xmath283 . in the bosonization approach , the interchain interaction , derived at 1th order , proportional to @xmath285 which now turn to be @xmath286 ,",
    "is then irrelevant and does not open a gap .",
    "the system is predicted to be critical and to consist of independent chains  @xcite .",
    "a similar change of sign of the interchain interactions appears in the bosonization approach of nt if @xmath287 for the 4-leg ladder .",
    "the same critical behavior could occur on the transition line in the 4-leg ladder and perhaps for @xmath27-leg ladders ( @xmath42 even ) .",
    "preliminary calculations indicate that the curve @xmath85 also remains on the classical boundary line for @xmath80 , where the model might be critical , perhaps down to @xmath288 .",
