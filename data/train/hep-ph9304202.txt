    "mass splittings among baryons and mesons containing different valence quarks provide a good probe of hadronic structure and of the forces that determine this structure  @xcite .",
    "recently , results were reported for a general class of models in which the baryon octet and decuplet splittings were assumed to arise solely from two - body interactions  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the central masses of isospin multiplets could be fitted with a model error of 8.9 mev .",
    "a similar parametrization of isospin splittings , also with a small model error , showed that the two measured @xmath2 masses were the hardest to fit .    in this paper",
    ", we shall extend the analysis to baryons containing heavy quarks ( thereby severely testing the assumption that three - body forces are negligible ) , and also to mesons .    since reporting on the fit in ref .",
    "@xcite we have recognized that the two sets of input @xmath2 values that had been averaged@xcite were obtained using essentially the same set of input experimental data .",
    "very similar analysis methods were also used , so the differences in the results should be treated as a systematic error .",
    "in addition , we have concluded , through discussions with colleagues@xcite , that there are additional systematic errors arising from differences in the treatment of the coupling to open channels .",
    "we estimate these theoretical uncertainties to be , at this time , about 0.5 mev for the @xmath3 states .",
    "similar systematic uncertainties would also occur in @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .",
    "since their widths are smaller and the errors are larger , we expect that this would give a negligible additional uncertainty to the masses of these states . with the enlarged error for the @xmath2 masses , the fit to octet and decuplet masses",
    "has a @xmath6 of 3.2 for 4 degrees of freedom , so that no model error needs to be invoked .",
    "however , almost all of this @xmath6 still arises from the @xmath2 masses .",
    "the results from this modified fit are shown in fig .",
    "[ isospin ] .",
    "the parameters from this fit will be used in fitting the heavy quark sector .",
    "although a breakdown of the spectator approximation in the charmed baryon sector would not be at all surprising ( since the heavy charm quark may significantly alter the environment in which the light quarks interact ) , we will in fact see that there appears to be little indication of such a breakdown in most of the data .",
    "the central masses of the charmed baryons may be expressed in terms of four pair energies @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ( in addition to the non - charm pair energies introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or in terms of the spin - dependent and spin - independent combinations @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "( @xmath13 indicates a spin - triplet quark pair , @xmath14 a spin - singlet quark pair , and the subscripts give the flavor content . )",
    "however , there are only four data , so we introduce an additional assumption . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was verified that @xmath15 , as is often assumed in models .",
    "here we also assume that @xmath16 . to give this constraint some flexibility",
    ", we introduce the auxiliary quantity @xmath17 , with an input value of @xmath18 mev .",
    "tables  [ tab : charmcentral1 ] and [ tab : charmcentral2 ] summarize the fit of these pair energies to the @xmath19 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath20 masses@xcite . including the correlated parameter errors from the non - charm sector shown in table  [ tab : charmcentral2 ] and the same model error of @xmath21 mev",
    ", we find an overall @xmath6 of 0.37 with one degree of freedom , thus the central masses are easily fitted with a sum of two - body energies .",
    "we may also express the central masses of the remaining ( unmeasured ) singly - charmed baryons in terms of pair energies to obtain the predictions shown in the left side of table  [ tab : charmpreds ] .",
    "( note that there are two @xmath1 states , since there is no symmetry restriction on the spin wavefunction of a @xmath22 baryon .",
    "we denote the @xmath23 state by @xmath1 and the @xmath24 state by @xmath25 .",
    "these states actually mix slightly  and this was taken into account in our calculations  but the effects are negligible .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite . )    the fits and predictions for @xmath26 and @xmath27 baryons are shown in fig .",
    "[ central ] .",
    "for the fits , the quantities plotted are the contributions of the spin - dependent terms @xmath28 .",
    "the spin - independent terms @xmath29 have been subtracted from the experimental data .",
    "for the non - charm baryons , we assume that @xmath30 .    we have also considered an additional stronger assumption , that the @xmath29 s are linear in the quark masses . in the non - charm sector , the three @xmath29 s are then fitted with two parameters , with @xmath31 , which is not excessive . in the charm sector , however , fitting the two new @xmath29 s with one new parameter gives @xmath32 .",
    "this indicates that the presence of the charm quark does affect the baryon structure , even though the fit to central masses shows no clear evidence for the existence of three - body effects .",
    "the fit to isospin splittings proceeds similarly .",
    "there is no advantage in discussing the individual @xmath0 and @xmath1 charge states , because their experimental errors are correlated in a complicated way .",
    "we therefore give results for the isospin tensorial quantities    [ eq : charmb ] @xmath33    the new pair terms , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are shown in table  [ tab : charmiso1 ] . note that @xmath34 is very small and has little influence on the splittings ; rather than treat it as a free parameter , we constrained it in the fit to @xmath36 mev , an estimate obtained from the sizes and uncertainties of various terms in the simple model described in ref .",
    "the best - fit value was @xmath37 mev .",
    "the total @xmath6 for the fit is @xmath38 .",
    "the final two rows of the table are clearly the most intriguing : we obtain a poor fit to @xmath39 and a worse fit to @xmath40 .",
    "if these measurements are correct , it appears that three - body effects are important for isospin splittings but not for the isospin - averaged central masses .",
    "the errors in the non - charm pair terms are correlated ; our fit uses the full correlation matrix , and the shifts in the values of these terms are shown in table  [ tab : charmiso2 ] .",
    "the fit to the individual @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses gives slightly adjusted values for the central @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses , which were used as the input in table  [ tab : charmcentral1 ] .",
    "as before , the pair term analysis gives rise to some predictions .",
    "these are shown in the right side of table  [ tab : charmpreds ] .",
    "it is interesting that the combination @xmath41 mev is given by @xmath42 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is independent of the charm pair terms .",
    "note also that in our model , @xmath43 .",
    "a description of mesonic splittings in terms of pair energies is not useful , since a new parameter must be introduced for each meson .",
    "while we are thus forced to commit ourselves to stronger assumptions here , we still strive for results which are as model - independent as possible .",
    "we focus on the _ differential _ vector - pseudoscalar isospin splittings , which we denote by @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , we define    [ eq : deltas ] @xmath45    these combinations , which have been considered previously by a number of authors@xcite , are interesting for several reasons :    _ i ) _ @xmath46 has recently been measured very precisely : @xmath47 mev ( ref .",
    "this datum constitutes a severe test ( or useful calibration point ) for model calculations .    _",
    "@xmath48 is also known rather precisely : @xmath49 mev ( ref .",
    "theorists have generally found it difficult to accomodate this value ; even those models which successfully account for related splittings typically predict @xmath50 mev ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . it has been suggested that relativistic and/or unitarity effects ( from @xmath51 , for example ) may be a source of the discrepancy .    _",
    "@xmath52 is known to be @xmath53 mev ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but the @xmath54 isospin splitting has not yet been measured , thus there is room for a prediction of @xmath55 .    _ iv ) _ as we shall presently see , it is possible to obtain predictions for the ratios @xmath56 which are quite model - independent .",
    "we write the quark - mass and electromagnetic contributions to @xmath44 as @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . to obtain @xmath57",
    ", we employ an interpolation technique first suggested by chan@xcite .",
    "consider , for the sake of definiteness , @xmath59 .",
    "from equation ( [ eq : deltac ] ) , we see that @xmath60 .",
    "this latter quantity may be accurately estimated with very little reliance on theory , since the function @xmath61 is rather well - determined by measurements of @xmath62 ,  @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; an interpolating curve drawn through these points allows the extraction of @xmath65  @xcite . the same procedure can be applied to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and the relevant curves for all three cases are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : interp ] .    in the case of d and b mesons",
    ", the hyperfine splittings turn out to be surprisingly independent of the lighter quark s mass : @xmath68 ( this is qualitatively understood in the quark model , where hyperfine splittings vary with the quark masses as @xmath69 ; in a linear potential , @xmath70 is proportional to the reduced mass @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 , which becomes independent of @xmath73 in the limit @xmath74 . ) thus @xmath59 and @xmath66 are both approximately zero .",
    "the second column of table  [ tab : mesonresults ] shows the actual results of the interpolation procedure ; we performed a quadratic fit to the three data points for d mesons , and a linear fit to the @xmath75 and @xmath76 data points for b mesons .",
    "the strange meson sector differs in that @xmath77 has significant @xmath78-dependence : the available data here are @xmath79 mev , @xmath80 mev , and @xmath81 mev .",
    "a cubic spline interpolation gives @xmath82 , however , without a data point for the @xmath83 mesons , the distance over which we must interpolate in this case is unsettlingly large .",
    "the @xmath83 data point is not directly available , of course , because annihilation forces rotate the pseudoscalar @xmath83 meson ( @xmath84 ) and its nonstrange partner ( @xmath85 ) into the physical @xmath86 and @xmath87 states .",
    "nevertheless , we may estimate the mass that @xmath84 would have in the absence of such forces by making use of the empirical rule  @xcite for the difference of like - flavor vector and pseudoscalar squared masses : @xmath88 .",
    "this implies @xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "independently , an equal - spacing rule should hold for the squared masses of ideally - mixed pseudoscalars so that @xmath91 , which gives @xmath92 .",
    "using this additional data point gives @xmath93 , where the error estimate reflects the dependence of the fitted slope on our choice of constituent quark masses  @xcite , and on the value of @xmath94 .",
    "almost all model calculations are consistent with @xmath95  mev  @xcite .",
    "we adopt this value and show @xmath57 in the third column of table  [ tab : mesonresults ] .    the electromagnetic contribution to @xmath44",
    "is given by , @xmath96 where the subscript @xmath97 refers to the heavy - flavor quark @xmath98 , and the subscript @xmath99 refers to the light anti - quark .",
    "the quantity @xmath100 is the coulomb energy in the pseudoscalar ( vector ) .",
    "the difference @xmath101 is induced by hyperfine distortion of the wavefunctions ; though it is often assumed to be negligible , explicit potential - model calculations indicate that this coulomb term is only about 30% smaller than the magnetic term in ( [ eq : deltagamma])@xcite .",
    "( we find it most convenient to discuss @xmath58 in a potential - model framework , however , our results will turn out to be nearly independent of the parameters  and even the functional form  of the potential , hence we suspect that our conclusions are more reliable than our method . )    consider calculating @xmath58 in a hamiltonian whose spin - independent part is @xmath102 this is a standard coulomb - plus - linear hamiltonian , with a particular ansatz for the way in which the effective strong coupling constant varies with the reduced mass of the system : @xmath103 .",
    "we shall presently show that this form for @xmath104 gives excellent phenomenology , but for the moment we just capitalize on the fact that it yields simple scaling laws for the wavefunctions and energies of @xmath105 . since @xmath106 it follows that the energies are proportional to @xmath107 , and wavefunction properties with dimension ( length)@xmath108 are proportional to @xmath109 . upon adding the spin - dependent term , @xmath110 we find the following scaling laws for the hyperfine , magnetic , and coulomb energies : @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 thus the coulomb and magnetic terms scale in the same way , and we have @xmath114    in fact , it is easy to check that the result ( [ eq : bdkratios ] ) holds not just for the specific potential in ( [ eq : coulinham ] ) , but for _ any _ potential of the form @xmath115 ( and also for @xmath116 , which behaves in many ways like the @xmath117 limit of @xmath118 ; we will refer to this logarithmic potential as @xmath119 . ) in the general case , the ratios of electromagnetic splittings are @xmath120 where @xmath121 .    with regard to the phenomenological soundness of equation ( [ eq : betaham ] ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : alphas ] shows the `` running '' of @xmath104 for three cases of interest , namely @xmath122 ( corresponding to logarithmic , linear , and harmonic confinement , respectively ) . in each case",
    ", the curve lies close to the empirical values of @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , which were determined by fitting to the measured @xmath126 and @xmath127 meson splittings  @xcite .",
    "( of course , the success of these fits is not mysterious ; there is little difficulty in accurately parametrizing a monotonic , closely spaced set of data points ( @xmath128 is only about 0.1 gev ) with an adjustable fitting function which is similarly monotonic . )",
    "thus the potentials @xmath118 , originally constructed just to give simple scaling behaviour , actually coincide closely with purely phenomenological potentials tuned to fit the meson spectrum .",
    "this indicates that we may apply equation ( [ eq : bdkratios2 ] ) with some confidence : fitting @xmath129 to @xmath130 mev , and taking @xmath131 we obtain the results shown in columns 4 and 5 of table  [ tab : mesonresults ] .",
    "the results are quite insensitive to @xmath132 and to the constituent quark masses ; @xmath133 and @xmath134 change by less than 5% when beta is varied between 0 and 2 , and by less than 10% when the quark masses are varied@xcite .",
    "we thus assign a 10% `` parameter uncertainty error '' to each of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and add it in quadrature with the error arising from @xmath129 .",
    "both of the predictions in table  [ tab : mesonresults ] are interesting .",
    "first , we obtain a negative value for @xmath55 , in disagreement with most other authors ( see table  [ tab : otherdbs ] ) .",
    "the sign of our prediction follows just from the near - vanishing of @xmath66 ( as implied by the near - equality of the @xmath135 and @xmath136 hyperfine splittings ) , and the fact that @xmath133 is negative definite ( since the coulomb and magnetic terms in equation  ( [ eq : deltagamma ] ) have the same sign ) .",
    "second , our result for @xmath48 is in agreement with the measured value , and even has the correct sign ( though in this case there is a large cancellation between the quark - mass and electromagnetic terms ) , so that @xmath48 can apparently be explained without invoking large relativistic or unitarity effects .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed baryon and meson isospin splittings and isomultiplet central masses in a constituent quark picture , avoiding ( as much as possible ) strong reliance on particular models or parameter sets .",
    "our results indicate that improved measurements of the @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath54 splittings would be most interesting .",
    "the @xmath2 masses are currently the most discrepant in the non - charm sector , the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 seem to indicate the existence of substantial three - body effects , and measurement of the sign of @xmath137 will provide a significant test of model calculations .",
