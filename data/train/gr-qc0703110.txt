    "a wormhole is a solution for the einstein s gravitational field equations that represents a hypothetical tunnel through spacetime .",
    "the detailed calculations about them are not simple , nevertheless with the techniques taught in a standard calculus course @xcite , it is not difficult to produce the embedded diagram of a wormhole based on geometry principles 3 .    since the discovery of the einstein equations , several features were addressed about these solutions , such as einstein - rosen bridges @xcite ; wheeler @xcite analyzed these kind of solutions and called them wormholes .",
    "the most important and popular contribution to this solution was given by morris and thorne @xcite , they were the first who made a complete and detailed investigation in this field .",
    "wormholes are solutions of the einstein field equations which represent two connect universes or a connection between two distant regions of universe .",
    "the most important solutions , which represent a static spherically symmetric spacetime possessing two asymptotically flat regions are : the lorentzian ( pseudo - riemannian manifold ) and the euclidian ( real riemannian manifold ) wormholes @xcite . both of them are interesting , but",
    "the real physics take place in the lorentzian type . for realistic models of traversable wormhole",
    ", one should address additional engineering issues such as tidal effects .",
    "people are sceptic about them because they contradict some energy conditions , for example , they need matter with negative energy density as a source @xcite .",
    "visser claim in his book @xcite : _ a wormhole is any compact region of spacetime with a topologically simple boundary but a topologically nontrivial interior_. the existence of them imply violations to the null energy condition as well as causality among others strange features . in quantum mechanics , there are many systems that violate this condition , but understanding the relation between gravity theories and quantum mechanics is in debate in these days .",
    "however , in this paper we are assuming that wormholes exist and we analyze the stability properties of the most simple of them .",
    "this is important because recently it has been increased the investigation about its behavior .",
    "a full revision about these solutions after the visser s book @xcite was done by lobo @xcite .    about lineal perturbation theory in wormhole solutions ,",
    "some of the most important works have been done by frolov and novikov @xcite , they analyzed them when interacting with an external electromagnetic or gravitational field .",
    "et al _ @xcite , studied the propagation in the wormhole geometry of different types of perturbations but not gravitational perturbations .",
    "they studied the reflection and transmission of massless scalar waves in presence of an ultrastatic wormhole .",
    "perez and hibberd @xcite , studied the same effect about the electromagnetic waves using numerical tools . a more detailed work about perturbation theory for a ultrastatic wormhole using teukolsky formalism , was done for torres del castillo and lpez - ortega @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the scalar , neutrino and electromagnetic perturbations using adjoint operators method for a ultrastatic wormhole spacetime . with this method",
    "torres del castillo _ et al _ found similar results in the electromagnetic case than perez and hibberd , which give us a very good signal of the confidence of the debye method .",
    "they obtained the transmission coefficient of a schrdinger type equation , establishing the relationship between this coefficient and the amount of radiation transmitted through the wormhole .",
    "finally , kim @xcite studied the perturbations of the scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational waves under the traversable lorentzian wormhole geometry ; kim found a regge - wheeler type equation for gravitational perturbations . using non - linear perturbations ,",
    "the instability of wormholes has been shown in @xcite but only numerically .    in this paper",
    "we use newman - penrose formalism to analyze the gravitational wave perturbations in the geometry of an ultrastatic worhmhole using debye potentials .",
    "also , we studied the propagation of gravitational fields showing that the radial part of the perturbations can be expressed in terms of schrdinger type equation . in sec",
    "ii the wormhole spacetime is described . in sec .",
    "iii the ultrastatic wormhole geometry is described in terms of a null tetrad . in sec .",
    "iv we find a schrdinger type equation for the perturbed einstein equations .",
    "we analyze the reflection and transmission coefficients of the gravitational waves as well as the conservation of the energy .",
    "finally conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "one solution to the einstein equations which represent static spherically symmetric spacetime possessing two asymptotically flat regions is a lorentzian wormhole , its metric has the form@xmath0where @xmath1 usually is called the redshift function , because it is related to the gravitational redshift .",
    "the @xmath2 function is related to the shape of the wormhole using embedding diagrams .",
    "they satisfy the conditions : @xmath3 always finite .",
    "the radial coordinate has a range that increases from a minimum value at @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 ) , corresponding to the wormhole throat , to infinity . as @xmath6 @xmath2 approaches @xmath7 which is defined as the mass of the wormhole .",
    "the einstein equations imply that such a metric exists if and only if the energy density and the radial tension in the frame of a static observer satisfies the relation @xmath8 ( @xmath9 denotes the energy density and @xmath10 denotes the radial tension ) , at least for a small region that includes the throat of the wormhole @xmath10 denotes the negative of the radial pressure .    for a traversable wormhole it must have no horizons which implies that @xmath11 must be finite everywhere . to keep the radial tides being zero",
    "it is sufficient to set @xmath1 equal to zero , resulting in an ultrastatic wormhole . in this case , we take a particular shape function @xmath2 that satisfies the wormhole requirements @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a constant .",
    "therefore , the metric that we will analyze is the following @xmath14    the proper radial distance is defined by , @xmath15measured by a static observer ; this distance must be well behaved in any region of the spacetime .",
    "as is well known , the metric ( [ ult ] ) can be written in terms of the proper radial distance by @xmath16where @xmath17 , in the general case this metric represents a spherically symmetric static wormhole provided that @xmath18 @xmath19 ; @xmath20 @xmath21 ; @xmath22 @xmath23 always finite .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled if we take expressions for the ultrastatic wormhole .",
    "the proper distance decreases from @xmath24 in the upper universe , to @xmath25 at the throat , and then from zero to @xmath26 in the lower universe .",
    "we have changed the signature of the metric according to @xcite to use the newman - penrose formalism .",
    "this method let us to decouple the perturbed einstein equations determined by one angular equation and another radial schrdinger - type differential equation .",
    "the potential associated to this latter equation gives us information about the stability of the system and their solution give us the energy fluxes .",
    "in this paper we study the gravitational perturbations of the wormhole metric following the method used in @xcite .",
    "this method consists in the use of vector potential perturbations of a solution of the einstein equations expressed in terms of a scalar ( debye ) potential .    in the ultrastatic wormhole metric",
    ", the gravitational perturbations are analyzed as a superposition of different _ modes _ with a @xmath27-time and azimuthal @xmath28-angular dependence specified by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is an integer and @xmath31 is a real positive constant .    for a description of the wormhole space - time solution ( [ 3 ] ) in a newman - penrose formalism @xcite ,",
    "the metric is described by @xmath32,\\ ] ] the bar denotes complex conjugated .",
    "the null tetrad @xmath33 and @xmath34 is defined by the following identities , @xmath35 so , we first need to define a null tetrad @xcite according to the wormhole metric , which is satisfy by @xmath36or equivalently we can define the directional derivatives , @xmath37the @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 , when acting on functions with a @xmath27 dependence of the form @xmath42 , are still just derivatives of @xmath43 .    the only nonvanishing component of the weyl scalar in the background spacetime is @xmath44which means that the wormhole metric solution is type * *  * * d in petrov classification @xcite . in order to decouple the perturbed einstein equations ( radial and angular part ) , the newman - penrose formalism is applicable only in type d metrics .",
    "type d space have two double principal null directions which define  radially \" ingoing and outgoing null congruences near the object which is the source of the field .    in the wormhole metric",
    ", the spin coefficients associated to this geometry are given by @xmath45where the only nonvanishing ricci scalars are @xmath46finally we can see the next relations between the nonvanishing component of the weyl spinor and the ricci scalars , @xmath47here @xmath48  is proportional to the curvature scalar @xmath49 .",
    "now we already have all the ingredients for use it in the adjoint operators method to find the gravitational perturbations of the ultrastatic wormhole metric ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we will use the perturbed einstein equations to obtain the teukolsky equation that allow us to analyze the stability of the wormhole solution through the radial equation and its potential .    in the newman - penrose formalism",
    "there are six equations - four bianchi identities and two ricci identities - which are linear and homogeneous in the quantities which vanish identically in the background , ( see  @xmath50 of @xcite , ( 321(a ) ) , ( 321(e ) ) , ( 321(d ) ) , ( 321(h ) ) ) : * *  * * @xmath51@xmath52and , on the other hand , the equations ( 310(b ) ) and ( 310(j ) ) from @xcite are respectively:@xmath53    these equations are linearized in the sense that the weyl scalars @xmath54",
