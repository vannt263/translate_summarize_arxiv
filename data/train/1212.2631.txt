    "universal low - energy properties result from the flow of these couplings , and depend only on the low - energy scales @xmath52 or @xmath77 .",
    "the high - energy band cutoff , @xmath30 , is simply the bare energy scale where the microscopic parameters of the model are defined : we thus use it as our unit of energy in the following .",

    "both scaling equations can be solved analytically to yield the scale dependent couplings : @xmath80 an immediate observation is that the strong coupling phases vanish as @xmath81 since then @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the density of states , eq .

    "the implication from the rg scaling equations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) , is that at high energies the physics is controlled by a ` local moment ' ( lm ) fixed point , describing a free impurity spin , decoupled from the bare host . for larger bare @xmath75 ( @xmath98 ) , the kondo coupling is renormalized faster as the temperature / energy scale is reduced , and hence the kondo effect will dominate .",
    "the ground state is then described by a ` symmetric strong coupling ' ( ssc ) fixed point , and the impurity spin is screened by conduction electrons .",
    "the remaining fermi liquid host degrees of freedom now also feel an additional phase shift ( equivalent to a modified boundary condition at the defect site ) due to the kondo effect . in the case of a diverging free density of states ,",
    "this results in an additional anomalous host contribution to physical properties , as shown below . alternatively ,",
    "if the potential scattering is initially very strong ( @xmath99 ) , then @xmath76 is renormalized faster and the ground state is described by the ` asymmetric local moment ' ( alm ) fixed point .",
