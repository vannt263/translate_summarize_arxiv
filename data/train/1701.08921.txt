    "with a growing demand for autonomous robots in a range of applications , such as search and rescue  @xcite , and space and underwater exploration  @xcite , it is essential for the robots to be able to navigate accurately for an extended period of time in order to accomplish the assigned tasks . to this end ,",
    "the ability to detect revisits ( i.e. , _ loop closure _ or place recognition ) becomes necessary , since it allows the robots to bound the errors and uncertainty in the estimates of their positions and orientations ( poses ) . in this work",
    ", we particularly focus on loop closure during visual navigation , i.e. , given a camera stream we aim to efficiently determine whether the robot has previously seen the current place or not .    even though the problem of loop closure has been extensively studied in the visual - slam literature ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) , a vast majority of existing algorithms typically require the _ offline _ training of visual words ( dictionary ) from _ a priori _ images that are acquired previously in visually similar environments . clearly , this is not always the case when a robot operates in an unknown , drastically different environment . in general , it is difficult to reliably find loops in ( visual ) appearance space .",
    "one particular challenge is the perceptual aliasing  that is , while images may be similar in appearance , they might be coming from different places . to mitigate this issue , both temporal ( i.e.",
    ", loops will only be considered closed if there are other loops closed nearby ) and geometric constraints ( i.e. , if a loop has to be considered closed , a valid transformation must exist between the matched images ) can be employed  @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that the approach of  @xcite decides on the quality of a match _ locally _  if the match with the highest score ( in some distance measure ) is away from the second highest , it is considered a valid candidate .",
    "however , the local information may lead to incorrect loop - closure decisions because both temporal and geometric conditions can easily fail in highly self - similar environments such as corridors in a hotel .    to address the aforementioned issues ,",
    "in this paper we introduce a _ general _ , _ online _ loop - closure approach for vision - based robot navigation .",
    "in particular , by realizing that loops typically occur intermittently in a navigation scenario , we , for the first time ever , formulate loop - closure detection as a sparse @xmath0-minimization problem that is convex .",
    "this is opposed to the current methods that cast loop closure detection as an image retrieval problem @xcite . by leveraging the fast convex optimization techniques",
    ", we subsequently solve the problem efficiently and achieve real - time frame - rate generation of loop - closure hypotheses .",
    "furthermore , the proposed formulation enjoys _",
    "flexible _ representations and can produce loop - closure hypotheses regardless of what the extracted features represent  that is , any discriminative information , such as descriptors , bag of words ( bow ) , or even whole images , can be used for detecting loops .",
    "lastly , we shall stress that our proposed approach declares a loop that is valid only when it is _ globally unique _ , which ensures that if perceptual aliasing is being caused by more than one previous image , _ no _ loop closure will be declared .",
    "although this is conservative in some cases , since a false loop closing can be catastrophic while missing a loop closure generally is not , ensuring such global uniqueness is necessary and important , in particular , in highly self - similar environments .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : after reviewing the related work , we formulate loop - closure detection as a sparse @xmath0-minimization problem in section [ sec : sparseandredunant ] . in section",
    "[ sec : detectionloops ] we present in detail the application of this formulation to visual navigation , which is validated via the real - world experiments in section [ sec : expr ] . finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes this work as well as outlines the possible directions for future research .",
    "the problem of loop - closure detection has been extensively studied in the slam literature and many different solutions have been proposed over the years ( e.g. , see  @xcite and references therein ) . in what follows ,",
    "we briefly overview the work that closely relates to the proposed approach .    in particular , the fab - map  @xcite is a probabilistic appearance - based approach using visual bow for place recognition , and was shown to work robustly over trajectories up to @xmath1  km .",
    "similarly , the binary - bow ( bbow)-based method  @xcite detects the fast keypoints  @xcite and employs a variation of the brief descriptors @xcite to construct the bow . a verification step is further enforced to geometrically check the features extracted from the matched images .",
    "it should be pointed out that both methods  @xcite are based on the similar ideas of text - retrieval @xcite : these methods learn the bow dictionaries beforehand , which are used later for detecting loop closures when the robots actually operates in the field .",
    "this restricts the expressive power of the dictionary in cases where it has to operate in environments drastically different from where the dictionary was constructed .",
    "in contrast , the proposed approach builds the dictionary _ online _ as the robot explores an unknown environment , while at the same time efficiently detecting loops ( if any ) .",
    "moreover , rather than solely relying on the descriptors - based bow , our method is flexible and can utilize _ all _ pixel information to discriminate places even in presence of dynamic objects ( encoded as sparse errors ) , any descriptor that can represent similar places , or any combination of such descriptors .",
    "some recent work has focused on loop closure under extreme changes in the environment such as different weather and/or lighting conditions at different times of the day .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed the seqslam that is able to localize with drastic lighting and weather changes by matching sequences of images with each other as opposed to single images .",
    "@xcite introduced the experience - based maps that learn the different appearances of the same place as it gradually changes in order to perform long - term localization .",
    "building upon @xcite , @xcite also discovered new images to attain better localization .",
    "in addition , @xcite have explored geometric features such as lines for the task of loop closure detection in both indoor and outdoor scenarios .",
    "note that if the information invariant to such changes can be extracted as in  @xcite , the proposed formulation can also be used to obtain loop - closure hypotheses .",
    "essentially , in this work we focus on finding loop closures given some discriminative descriptions such as descriptors and whole images , assuming _ no _ specific type of image representations .",
    "more recently , with the rediscovery of efficient machine learning techniques , convolutional neural networks ( cnns)@xcite have been exploited to address loop closure detection @xcite .",
    "these networks are multi - layered architectures that are typically trained on millions of images for tasks such as object detection and scene classification .",
    "the internal representations at each layer are learned from the data itself and therefore can be used as features to replace hand - crafted features . based on this approach , @xcite",
    "extract features from different layers in the network and identify the layers that are useful for view - point and illumination invariant place recognition .",
    "moreover , in @xcite landmarks are treated as objects by finding object proposals in the images and features are extracted for them using deep networks .",
    "these features then allow for view - point invariant place categorization by matching different objects from varied viewpoints . in these cnn - based place",
    "categorization techniques , the networks are used as feature extractors followed by some form of matching . in this paper , we show that these deep features can also be utilized in the proposed framework of loop - closure detection .",
    "it should be noted that in our previous conference publication @xcite , we have preliminarily shown that the proposed loop - closing framework is general and can employ most hand - crafted features .",
    "recently , @xcite extended this sparse - optimization based framework to an incremental formulation allowing for the use of the previous solution of the sparse optimization to jump start the next one , while @xcite further extended it to a multi - step delayed detection of loops ( instead of single - step detection as in our prior work  @xcite ) in order to exploit the structured sparsity of the problem . in this paper , we present more detailed analysis and thorough performance evaluations , including new experiments using deep features and validations in challenging multiple - revisit scenarios , as well as new comparisons against the well - known nearest neighbour ( nn ) search .",
    "in this section , we formulate loop - closure detection as a sparse optimization problem based on a sparse and redundant representation .",
    "such representations have been widely used in computer vision for problems such as denoising  @xcite , deblurring  @xcite , and face recognition  @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite formulated the back - end of graph slam as an @xmath0-minimization problem .",
    "however , _ no _ prior work has yet investigated this powerful technique for loop closure detection in robot navigation .",
    "the key idea of this approach is to represent the problem _ redundantly _ , from which a _ sparse _ solution is sought for a given observation .",
    "suppose that we have the current image represented by a vector @xmath2 , which can be either the vectorized full raw image or descriptors extracted from the image .",
    "assume that we also have a dictionary denoted by @xmath3\\in \\mathcal r^{n \\times m}$ ] , which consists of @xmath4 basis vectors of the same type as @xmath5 .",
    "thus , solving the linear system @xmath6 yields the representation of @xmath5 in the base @xmath7 in the form of the vector @xmath8 .",
    "elements of @xmath9 indicate which basis vectors , @xmath10 , best explain @xmath5 and how much the corresponding contributions are . a zero contribution ( @xmath11 ) simply implies that the corresponding basis vector @xmath10 is irrelevant to  @xmath5 .",
    "one trivial example of a dictionary is the @xmath12 identity matrix , @xmath13 , which gives us the same representation , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to note that we have made _ no _ assumption about what the dictionary contains , and in general , any arbitrary bases including random matrices or wavelets can be used as a dictionary .",
    "we know that a general vector @xmath5 can be represented by a basis matrix @xmath7 if and only if it belongs to the range space of @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath15 . carefully choosing these bases may result in a sparse representation , i.e. , @xmath9 is sparse .",
    "very often this is the case in practice , because the signal is naturally sparse when represented in a certain , often overcomplete , basis @xcite .",
    "for instance , when representing an image using the wavelet basis , there are only a few coefficients that are nonzero .",
    "note also that a vector may not be representable by the bases , for example , if the basis matrix ( dictionary ) is rank - deficient and the vector is in the right nullspace of the matrix . to exclude such singular cases , in this work , we assume that the image vector @xmath5 is always representable by the basis matrix which is of full row rank ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) .",
    "moreover , we allow the bases to be redundant , that is , we may have more ( not necessarily orthogonal ) basis vectors than the dimension of the image vector ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) .",
    "note that this assumption can be satisfied by carefully designing the dictionary ( see section  [ sec : detectionloops ] ) .",
    "in general , a redundant dictionary leads to the sparse representation of the current image , which is what we seek and describes the sparse nature of the loop - closure events ( i.e. , occurring sparsely ) . consider that we have @xmath17 basis vectors , then @xmath6 becomes an under - determined linear system and has infinitely many solutions .",
    "therefore , we have to regularize it in order to attain a unique solution by specifying a desired criterion that the solution should satisfy .",
    "typically , this regularization takes the form of looking for a solution , @xmath18 , that leads to the minimum reconstruction error in the @xmath19-norm sense , which corresponds to the least - squares formulation : @xmath20 note that @xmath19-norm is widely used in practice in part because of the closed - form unique solution , while leading to a _ dense _ representation , i.e. , almost all of the elements of @xmath18 are non - zero and thus all the basis vectors are involved in representing the current image vector .",
    "this goes against our prior knowledge of loop closures occurring sparsely .",
    "theoretically , the least - squares solution can lie very far from the sparse solution for an underdetermined system @xcite , which motivates the ensuing sparse formulation .    due to the fact that loop - closure events often occur sparsely",
    ", we instead aim to find the _ sparsest _",
    "possible solution under the condition that it best explains the current image . intuitively , by assuming that the basis dictionary consists of all the previous observed images and thus is redundant , we are looking for the smallest possible subset of previous images that can best explain the current image .",
    "the smallest such subset would contain just a single image which is `` closest '' to the current image ( in appearance or descriptor space ) under the assumption that there exists a unique image from the past which matches the current image . to that end",
    ", we employ the @xmath21-norm to quantify the sparsity of a vector , i.e. , @xmath22 , the total number of non - zero elements in @xmath9 .",
    "note that a vector with @xmath23 non - zero elements is called @xmath23-sparse .",
    "thus , the problem of loop closure can be formulated as follows : @xmath24 the above problem is a combinatorial optimization problem which in general is np - hard  @xcite , because all of the possible @xmath23-sparse vectors have to be enumerated to check whether they fulfill the constraint . to address this computational - intractability issue",
    ", we relax the @xmath21-norm in   to @xmath0-norm , which is defined as the summation of absolute values of the elements of @xmath9 , @xmath25 , since it is known that @xmath0-norm is the closest convex approximation to @xmath21-norm and also results in a sparse solution  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath26    the problem   assumes the perfect reconstruction without noise , which clearly is not the case in practice .",
    "hence , we introduce a sparse noise ( error ) term along with the basis vectors to explain the current image and reformulate as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "note that we have normalized the basis vectors when building the dictionary @xmath30 , and thus @xmath31 can be considered as the noise bases along each of the @xmath32 directions of the data space , and @xmath33 becomes an indication variable for which noise components dominate the reconstruction error .",
    "this allows us to normalize @xmath9 and @xmath33 together when computing contributions of data and noise bases ( see section  [ sec : build - dict ] ) .",
    "we stress that this new formulation of loop closure   takes advantage of the fact that @xmath0-norm automatically promotes sparsity , as opposed to the more commonly used @xmath19-based least - squares formulation  @xcite . in solving for a minimum @xmath0-norm solution",
    ", we are in effect seeking an explanation of the current image with the fewest basis vectors from the redundant dictionary . this problem is also known as atomic decomposition  @xcite , since @xmath5 is decomposed into its constituent atoms in the dictionary .",
    "we have formulated loop closure as a sparse convex @xmath0-minimization problem   in the preceding section .",
    "we now present in detail how this novel formulation can be utilized in vision - based robot navigation . in",
    "what follows , we first explain how a dictionary can be constructed _ incrementally online _ , and then how such a dictionary can be used at _ each time step _ to generate loop - closure hypotheses .",
    "the first step in the proposed process of detecting loops is to build a set of basis vectors that make up the dictionary . unlike the state - of - the - art loop - closure detection methods ( e.g. ,  @xcite )",
    ", the proposed approach does _ not _ learn the dictionary _ offline _ before the start of the experiment .",
    "instead , the dictionary is built exclusively for the current experiment , as the robot moves and collects images  that is , incrementally _ online _ as images arrive .    as a new image becomes available",
    ", a mapping function , @xmath34 , transforms the image of resolution @xmath35 to a unit vector of dimension @xmath32 . due to the flexibility of representation enjoyed by our proposed approach ,",
    "this function is general and can be either a whole image or descriptors such as hog @xcite and gist @xcite computed over the image .",
    "that is , the basis vectors can represent any information that helps distinguish between two images .",
    "the proposed method can be considered as data association in a high - dimensional space carried out by ( approximately ) reconstructing a given vector from a subset of unit vectors in that space . as",
    "such , this approach is agnostic to what these vectors physically represent .",
    "for this reason , versatility of representation is inherent to our algorithm , allowing representations ranging from whole images to descriptors , bow , or even mean and variance normalized images over time for matching sequences across different times of day or changing weather conditions .",
    "also , since we use the @xmath19-norm of the error ( i.e. , euclidean distance ) to measure how good the reconstruction is , any descriptor whose distance between two vectors is measured in term of @xmath19-norm , can be naturally incorporated in the proposed approach .    in order to ensure full row rank of the dictionary matrix  @xmath30",
    ", we initialize the dictionary with an identity matrix @xmath36 , which also accounts for the bases of the noise @xmath33 [ see  ] . when the first image denoted by @xmath37 arrives , @xmath38 is added to the dictionary . in general , updating the dictionary at the @xmath39-th time step is simply appending @xmath40 to the end of the current dictionary .",
    "however , before augmenting the dictionary , we need to determine whether or not there are some previous images that explain the current one , i.e. , we need to detect any loop that can be closed based on the current image .      once the dictionary @xmath41 is available and when an image arrives at every time step , we are now ready to solve the convex , sparse @xmath0-minimization problem   in order to find ( if any ) loop closures .",
    "while various approaches such as the primal - dual method are available for solving a convex optimization problem  @xcite , we here leverage the homotopy approach because of its efficiency  @xcite , which is specifically designed to take advantage of the properties of @xmath0-minimization .    in particular , relaxing the equality constraint in   yields the following _ constrained _ minimization : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a pre - determined noise level .",
    "this is termed the basis pursuit denoising problem in compressive sensing  @xcite . an equivalent variant of   is the following _ unconstrained _ minimization problem that is actually solved by the homotopy approach : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a scalar weighting parameter . to solve",
    ", the homotopy method uses the fact that the objective function undergoes a homotopy continuation from the @xmath19 cost ( the second term ) to the @xmath0 cost ( the first term ) as @xmath45 increases from zero to one  @xcite .",
    "the computational complexity of this approach is @xmath46 for recovering a @xmath23-sparse signal in @xmath23 steps using an @xmath47 dictionary , although in the worst case when recovering a non - sparse solution in a high - dimensional observational space and large number of basis vectors , it can perform as worse as @xmath48 , which fortunately is not the case in this work .",
    "the above homotopy solver is employed to determine loop closure for the @xmath39-th image represented by @xmath49 , by solving   for @xmath50 using the up - to - date dictionary @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "is hereafter used to denote the time index , thus revealing the online incremental process of the proposed approach . ]",
    "the solution @xmath52 at the @xmath39-th time step contains the contribution of all previous bases in constructing the current image . to find a unique image to close a loop with , we are interested in which basis vector has the greatest relative contribution , which can be found by calculating the unit vector @xmath53 .",
    "any entry greater than a predefined threshold , @xmath54 , is considered a loop - closure candidate .",
    "in addition , due to the fact that in a visual navigation scenario , the neighbouring images are typically overlapped with the current image and thus have great `` spurious '' contributions , we explicitly ignore a time window , @xmath55 , around the current image , during which loop - closure decisions are not taken .",
    "this is a design parameter and can be chosen based on the camera frequency ( fps ) and robot motion .",
    "once the decision is made , the dictionary is updated by appending @xmath56 to it , i.e. , @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the main steps of this process are summarized in algorithm  [ alg : l1-loops ] .",
    "dictionary @xmath58 , current image @xmath59 , threshold @xmath60 , weight @xmath61 , ignoring - time window @xmath55    loop - closure hypotheses @xmath62 , updated dictionary @xmath63    @xmath64    _ hypothesis generation :",

    "in the ideal case of no perceptual aliasing , the solution is expected to be @xmath69-sparse , because _ ideally _ there exists only one image in the dictionary that matches the current image when a revisit occurs . in the case of exploration where there is no actual loop - closure match in the dictionary",
    ", the current image is best explained by the last observed and the solution hence is still @xmath69-sparse , which however will not generate a valid loop - closure detection because of the temporal constraint @xmath55 enforced in our implementation .",
    "note that if there are significant differences such as illumination or dynamic objects , the solution may no longer be @xmath69-sparse ( see section  [ sec : norland ] ) .    in a general case where @xmath70 images that have been previously observed and that are visually similar to the current image , a naive thresholding based method  which simply compares the current image to each of the previous ones based on some similarity measure  would likely produce @xmath71 loop - closure hypotheses corresponding to the @xmath71 images in the dictionary .",
    "it is very important to note that such an approach independently calculates the contribution of each previous image , _ without _ taking into account the effects of other images or data noise , despite the fact that due to noise they may be correlated and thus is _ suboptimal_. in contrast , the proposed @xmath0-minimization - based approach simultaneously computes the optimal contribution of all the previous images and noise by finding the global optimal solution @xmath72 of the convex problem  , and guarantees the unique hypothesis by selecting the @xmath73-th image with the greatest @xmath74 . in the case of multiple revisits to the same location , the proposed approach , as presented here , is _ conservative _ ( i.e , only one , but the best one , revisit would be selected ) .",
    "including the corresponding images from earlier visits in the dictionary would lead to a non - unique solution , when the same location is revisited again .",
    "however , the proposed method can be easily extended to detect loops on multiple revisits . instead of considering the contribution of all the previous basis separately ,",
    "if a loop exists between previous locations @xmath71 and @xmath75 , we consider their joint contribution ( @xmath76 ) when making the decision .",
    "this ensures that even though these places are not individually unique enough to explain the current image , together ( and since they are visually similar as we already have a loop closure between them ) , they best explain the current observation , allowing us to detect loop closures in case of multiple revisits .",
    "we stress that the dictionary representation used by the proposed approach is general and flexible .",
    "although we have focused on the simplest basis representation using the down - sampled whole images ( see section  [ sec : expr ] ) , this does not restrict our method only to work with this representation .",
    "in fact , any discriminative feature that can be extracted from the image ( e.g. , gist , hog , etc . ) can be used as dictionary bases for finding loops , thus permitting the desired properties such as view and illumination invariance . to show that , particular experiments have been performed in section  [ sec : expr ] , using different types of bases and their combinations . moreover , it is not limited to a single representation at a time . if we have @xmath71 descriptors @xmath77 , a multi - modal descriptor can be easily formed by stacking them up in a vector in @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this idea has recently been exploited in @xcite .",
    "therefore , our proposed method can be considered as a _",
    "generalized _ loop - closing approach that can use any basis vectors as long as a metric exists to provide the distance between them .",
    "it is interesting to point out that sparse @xmath0-minimization inherently is robust to _ data noise _",
    ", which is widely appreciated in computer vision ( e.g. , see  @xcite )",
    ". in particular , the sparse noise ( error ) term in   can account for the presence of dynamic changes or motion blurs .",
    "for example , in  fig .",
    "[ fig : newcollege - pics ] the dominant background basis explains most of the image , while the dynamic elements ( which have not been observed before ) can be represented by the sparse noise , and fig .",
    "[ fig : newcollege ] shows that the proposed approach robustly finds these loops .",
    "such robust performance becomes necessary particularly for long - term mapping where the environment often gradually changes over time and thus reliable loop closure in presence of such changes is essential .    as a final remark , the proposed @xmath0-minimization - based loop - closure algorithm is also robust to _ information loss _ , which is closely related to the question raised by @xcite : how much information is needed to successfully close loops ?",
    "in this work , we have empirically investigated this problem by down - sampling the raw images ( which are used as the bases of the dictionary ) without any undistortion and then evaluating the performance of the proposed approach under such an adverse circumstance . as shown in section  [ sec : expr ] , truly small raw images , even with size as low as @xmath80 pixels , can be used to reliably identify loops , which agrees with the findings of  @xcite .",
    "to validate the proposed @xmath0-minimization - based loop - closure algorithm , we perform a set of real - world experiments on the publicly - available datasets .",

    "subsequently , we evaluate the proposed method on the rawseeds dataset  @xcite and focus on the effects of the design parameters used in the algorithm . finally , we perform experiments on the kitti visual odometry benchmark @xcite , by highlighting the ability of the proposed approach to use different types of deeply learned features as representations , as well as the superior performance against a nearest neighbour ( nn)-based approach .

    "we also eliminate random matches by enforcing a temporal consistency check , requiring at least one more loop closure within a time window from the current match .",

    "[ fig : repeatedvisits ] that even in the case of 60 revisit , the proposed method is able to associate the current image to the first occurrence of the bases in the dictionary .",

    "these results imply that a sparse solution can be constructed even for small values of @xmath45 and the solutions is still much sparser as compared to the nn solution .",
    "while the problem of loop closure has been well studied in visual navigation , motivated by the sparse nature of the problem ( i.e. , only a small subset of past images actually close the loop with the current image ) , in this work , we have for the first time ever posed it as a sparse convex @xmath0-minimization problem .",
    "the _ globally optimal _ solution to the formulated convex problem , by construction , is _ sparse _",

    "furthermore , the proposed formulation enjoys a _ flexible _ representation of the basis used in the dictionary , with _ no _ restriction on how the images should be represented ( e.g. , what descriptors to use ) .",
    "provided any type of image vectors that can be quantified with some metric to measure the similarity , the proposed formulation can be used for loop closing .",
    "extensive experimental results have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm , using either the whole raw images as the simplest possible representation or the high - dimensional descriptors extracted from the entire images including feature from deep neural networks .",
    "we have also shown empirically how the design parameters effect the performance of our method , and in general , the proposed approach is able to efficiently detect loop closing for real - time applications .",
    "the quality of loop closure depends on the type of descriptor employed for the task .",
    "raw images do not provide view - point or illumination invariance . for detecting loop closures in drastically different illumination conditions such as day and night",
    ", the problem is reduced to finding a suitable descriptor and then the proposed framework can be employed .",
    "we currently use a single threshold  @xmath54 to control the loop - closure hypotheses , which guarantees a globally unique hypothesis .",
    "however , in the case of multiple revisits to the same location , this hard thresholding would prevent detecting any loop closures and the revisits would be simply considered as perceptual aliasing , which is conservative but loses information . in the future",
    ", we will investigate different ways to address this issue .",
    "for example , as mentioned earlier , we can sum up the contributions of basis vectors if a loop has already been detected between them and thus ensure that multiple visits lead to more robust detection of loop closures .",
    "nevertheless , this has not been a major issue in our tests ; as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : newcollege ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : repeatedvisits ] , the proposed algorithm is capable of detecting loops at different revisits , even in the worst case scenario . as briefly mentioned before , the number of basis vectors in the dictionary grows continuously and can prohibit the real - time performance for large - scale problems . to mitigate this issue",
    ", one possible way would be to update the dictionary dynamically by checking a novelty factor in terms of how well the current image can be explained by the existing dictionary , which is akin to adding `` key frames '' in visual slam .",

    "<S> our approach ensures a _ unique _ hypothesis by choosing only a single globally optimal match when making a loop - closure decision . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the proposed formulation enjoys a _ flexible _ representation with _ no _ restriction imposed on how images should be represented , while requiring only that the representations are `` close '' to each other when the corresponding images are visually similar . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed algorithm is validated extensively using real - world datasets .    </S>",
