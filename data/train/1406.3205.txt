    "this norm is induced by its _ unit ball _",
    "@xmath1 , which is a compact , convex set centered at the origin ( or , shortly , _ centered _ ) .",
    "thus , we write @xmath4 for a minkowski plane with unit ball @xmath1 , whose boundary is the _ unit circle _ of @xmath4 . the geometry of normed planes and spaces , usually called _ minkowski geometry _ ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , is strongly related to and influenced by the fields of convexity , banach space theory , finsler geometry and , more recently , discrete and computational geometry .",
    "the present paper can be considered as one of the possibly first contributions to discrete differential geometry in the spirit of minkowski geometry .",
    "the study of special types of curves in minkowski planes is a promising subject ( see the survey @xcite ) , and the particular case of curves of constant minkowskian width has been studied for a long time ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and   2 of @xcite ) .",

    "constant @xmath1-width _ , if @xmath6 is constant with respect to the norm induced by @xmath1 , where @xmath7 denotes the support function of @xmath5 .",
    "another concept from the classical theory of planar curves important for our paper is that of _ involutes and evolutes _ ; see , e.g. , chapter 5 of @xcite and , respectively , @xcite . for natural generalizations of involutes , which also might be extended from the euclidean case to normed planes , we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "and in @xcite it is shown how the concept of evolutes and involutes can help to construct curves of constant width in the euclidean plane .    in this paper",
    ", we consider convex polygons @xmath0 of constant minkowskian width in a normed plane , for short calling them _ cw - polygons_. if @xmath0 is a cw polygon , then the unit ball @xmath1 is necessarily a centered polygon whose sides and diagonals are suitably parallel to corresponding sides and diagonals of @xmath0 ( sometimes with diagonals suitably meaning also sides ; see     2.1 below ) .",
    "if , in particular , @xmath1 is homothetic to @xmath8 , then , and only then , @xmath0 is of constant @xmath1-width in the minkowski plane induced by @xmath1 .",
    "there are many results concerning _ smooth cw curves _ in normed planes : barbier s theorem fixing their circumference only by the diameter of the curve ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) ; relations between curvature , evolutes , involutes , and equidistants ( see @xcite and , for applications of minkowskian evolutes in computer graphics , @xcite ) ; mixed areas , and the relation between the area and length of a cw curve cut off along a diameter ( see @xcite , ( 2.1 ) ) . in this paper",
    "we prove corresponding results for _ cw polygons_. we note that our results are direct discretizations of the corresponding results for the smooth case , where the derivatives and integrals are replaced by differences and sums .",
    "it is meant in this sense that the results of this paper can be considered as one of the first contributions to discrete differential geometry in the framework of normed planes .    among the @xmath1-equidistants of a smooth cw curve @xmath5 , there is a particular one called _",
    "central equidistant_. the central equidistant of @xmath5 coincides with its _ area evolute _ , while the evolute of @xmath5 coincides with its _ center symmetry set _ ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we show that for a cw polygon @xmath0 the same results hold : the central equidistant @xmath9 coincides with the area evolute , and the evolute @xmath10 coincides with the central symmetry set ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since the equidistants of @xmath0 are the involutes of @xmath10 , we shall choose the central equidistant as a representative of them , and we write @xmath11 .",
    "for a minkowski plane whose unit ball @xmath1 is a centered convex ( 2n)-gon , the _ dual unit ball _",
    "@xmath12 is also a centered convex ( 2n)-gon with diagonals parallel to the sides of @xmath1 , and the sides parallel to diagonals of @xmath1 . as in the smooth case ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the involutes of the central equidistant of @xmath0 form a one - parameter family of polygons having constant @xmath12-width .",
    "this one - parameter family consists of the @xmath12-equidistants of any of its members , and we shall choose the central equidistant @xmath13 as its representative .",
    "thus we write @xmath14 .",
    "in @xcite it is proved that , for smooth curves , the analogous involute @xmath13 is contained in the region bounded by @xmath9 and has smaller or equal signed area . in this paper",
    "we prove the corresponding fact for polygons , namely , that @xmath13 is contained in the region bounded by @xmath9 and the signed area of @xmath13 is not larger than the signed area of @xmath9 .    what happens if we iterate the involutes ?",
    "let @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and define @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "then we obtain two sequences @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the first being of constant @xmath1-width and the second of constant @xmath12-width .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the closure of the region bounded by @xmath24 . denoting by @xmath25 the intersection of all these sets",
    ", we shall prove that @xmath26 is in fact a single point .",
    "another form of describing the convergence of @xmath20 and @xmath21 to @xmath26 is as follows : for fixed @xmath27 and @xmath28 , consider the sequences @xmath29 of polygons of constant @xmath1-width , and the sequences @xmath30 of polygons of constant @xmath12-width .",
    "then these sequences are converging to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , which are @xmath1- and @xmath12-balls centered at @xmath26 . for smooth curves",
    "the analogous results were proved in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe geometrically the unit ball of a minkowski plane for which a given convex polygon has constant minkowskian width . in section 3 , we define minkowskian curvature , evolutes and involutes for cw polygons and prove many properties of them . in section 4",
    "we consider the involute of the central equidistant , and in section 5 we prove that the involutes iterates are converging to a single point .",
    "since faces and also width functions of convex sets behave additively under ( vector or ) minkowski addition , it is clear that a polygon @xmath0 is of constant minkowskian width if and only if @xmath8 is a homothetical copy of the unit ball @xmath1 of the respective normed plane ; see , e.g. ,    2.3 of @xcite .",
    "if , moreover , the homothety of @xmath1 and @xmath33 is only possible when @xmath0 itself is already centrally symmetric , then the only sets of constant @xmath1-width are the balls of that norm ; cf . , e.g. , @xcite . in the following",
    "we will have a closer look at various geometric relations between polygons @xmath0 of constant @xmath1-width and the unit ball @xmath1 , since we need them later .",
    "thus , let @xmath0 be an arbitrary planar convex polygon . by an abuse of notation",
