    "networks such as the internet and the world - wide web do not grow in an orderly manner .",
    "for example , the web is created by the uncoordinated effort of millions of users and thus lacks an engineered architecture .",
    "although such networks are complex in structure @xcite , their large size is a simplifying feature , and for infinitely large networks the rate equation approach @xcite provides analytical predictions for basic network characteristics . nevertheless , social and technological networks are not large in a thermodynamic sense ( _ e.g. _ , the number of molecules in a glass of water vastly exceeds the number of routers in the internet ) .",
    "thus fluctuations in network properties can be expected to play a more prominent role than in thermodynamic systems@xcite .",
    "additionally , extreme properties , such as the degree the node with the most links in a network @xcite , the website with the most hyperlinks , or the wealth of the richest person in a society , are important characteristics of finite systems .",
    "the size dependence of these properties or their distribution is difficult to treat within a rate equation approach .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the role of finiteness and the nature of fluctuations about mean values for large , but finite growing networks .",
    "we shall focus primarily on the degree distribution @xmath1 , the number of nodes that are linked to @xmath0 other nodes in a network of @xmath2 links , as well as related local structural characteristics .",
    "we shall argue that self averaging holds for the degree distribution , so that the random variables @xmath1 become sharply peaked about their average values in the @xmath3 limit .",
    "we shall also argue that the probability distribution for the number of nodes of fixed degree , @xmath4 , is generally a gaussian , with fluctuations that vanish as @xmath3 . on the other hand , higher moments of the degree distribution do not self average .",
    "this loss of self - averaging ultimately stems from the power - law tail in the degree distribution itself .    in the next section ,",
    "we define the growing network model and briefly review the behavior of the average degree distribution in the thermodynamic @xmath3 limit .",
    "we also discuss how the average degree distribution can naturally be expected to attain a finite - size scaling form for large but finite @xmath2 .",
    "we then describe our general strategy for studying fluctuations in these growing networks . in sec .",
    "iii , we outline our simulational approach and present data for the average degree distribution . in the following two sections",
    ", we examine the role of finiteness on the degree distribution , both within a continuous formulation based on the rate equations ( sec .",
    "iv ) , and an exact discrete approach ( sec .  v ) .",
    "the former approach is the one that is conventionally applied to study the kinetics of evolving sustems , such as growing networks .",
    "while this approach has the advantage of simplicity and it provides an accurate description for the degree distribution in an appropriate degree range , it is quantitatively inaccurate in the large degree limit .",
    "this is the domain where discreteness effects play an important role and the exact discrete recursion relations for the evolution of the degree distribution are needed to fully account it properties . in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss the implications of our results for higher moments of the degree distribution and their associated fluctuations . sec .",
    "vii provides conclusions and some perspectives .",
    "calculational details are given in the appendices .",
    "the growing networks considered in this work are built by adding nodes to the network one at a time according to the rule that each new node attaches to a single previous node with a rate proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath0 is the degree of the target node .",
    "we investigate the class of models in which @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , but is otherwise arbitrary .",
    "the general situation of @xmath8 , corresponds to linear preferential attachment , but with an additive shift @xmath9 in the rate .",
    "this model was originally introduced by simon to account for the word frequency distribution @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath10 corresponds to the barabsi - albert model@xcite , while the limit @xmath11 corresponds to random attachment in which each node has an equal probability of attracting a connection from the new node .",
    "thus by varying @xmath9 , we can tune the relative importance of popularity in the attachment rate .",
    "previous work on the structure of such networks was primarily concerned with the configuration - averaged degree distribution @xmath12 , where the angle brackets denote an average over all realizations of the growth process for an ensemble of networks with the same initial condition . additionally , most studies focused on the tail region where @xmath0 is much smaller than any other scale in the system . for attachment rate @xmath6 ,",
    "this average degree distribution has a power - law tail@xcite , @xmath13 as @xmath14 . in the specific case of @xmath15 ,",
    "the average degree distribution explicitly is@xcite @xmath16    for finite @xmath2 , however , the degree distribution must eventually deviate from these predictions because the maximal degree can not exceed @xmath2 . to establish the range of applicability of eqs .",
    "( [ nkw ] ) , we estimate the magnitude of the largest degree in the network , @xmath17 by the extreme statistics criterion @xmath18 .",
    "this yields @xmath19 .",
    "we therefore anticipate that the average degree distribution will deviate from eq .",
    "( [ nkw ] ) when @xmath0 becomes of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "the existence of a maximal degree also suggests that the average degree distribution should attain a finite - size scaling form @xmath20 some aspects of these finite - size corrections were recently studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . one basic result of our work is that we can compute the scaling function explicitly .",
    "we find that this function is peaked for @xmath0 of the order of @xmath17 and that it depends substantially on the initial condition .",
    "in contrast , the small - degree tail of the distribution ",
    "the reason why such networks were dubbed scale - free  is independent of @xmath2 and the initial condition .    to study finite networks where fluctuations can be significant ,",
    "we need a stochastic approach rather than a deterministic rate equation formulation . for finite @xmath2",
    ", the state of a network is generally characterized by the set @xmath21 that occurs with probability @xmath22 .",
    "the network state @xmath23 evolves by the following processes : @xmath24 the first process corresponds to the new node attaching to an existing node of degree 1 ; in this case , the number of nodes of degree 1 does not change while the number of nodes of degree 2 increases by 1 .",
    "the second line accounts for the new node attaching to a node of degree @xmath25 .    from these processes",
    ", it is straightforward , in principle , to write the master equation for the joint probability distribution @xmath22 .",
    "it turns out that correlation functions of a given order are coupled only to correlation functions of the same and lower orders .",
    "thus we do not need to invoke factorization ( as in kinetic theory ) and we could , in principle , solve for correlation functions recursively .",
    "however , this would provide much more information than is of practical interest .",
    "typically we are interested in the degree distribution , or perhaps two - body correlations functions of the form @xmath26 .",
    "even though straightforward in principle , it is difficult to compute even the two - point correlation functions @xmath27 for general @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this work",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the specific ( and simpler ) examples of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "we will use these results to help characterize fluctuations in finite networks .",
    "to simulate a network with attachment rate @xmath6 efficiently , we exploit an equivalence to the growing network with re - direction ( gnr ) @xcite . in the gnr , a newly - introduced node *",
    "n * selects an earlier `` target '' node * x * _ uniformly_. with probability @xmath33 , a link from * n * to * x * is created .",
    "however , with probability @xmath34 , the link is _ re - directed _ to the ancestor node * y * of node * x * ( fig .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the gnr is equivalent to a growing network with attachment rate @xmath6 , with @xmath35 .",
    "thus , for example , the gnr with @xmath36 corresponds to the growing network with linear preferential attachment , @xmath15 .",
    "simulation of the gnr is extremely simple because the selection of the initial target node is purely random and the ensuing re - direction step is local .",
    "0.4 in = 2.4 in 0.1 in    there is , however , an important subtlety about this equivalence that was not discussed previously in ref .  @xcite .",
    "namely , the redirection process does not apply when a node has no ancestor . by construction ,",
    "every node that is added to the network does have a single ancestor , but some primordial nodes may have none .",
    "for example , for the very natural `` dimer '' initial condition @xmath37 , the seed node on the left has no ancestor and the gnr construction for this node is ambiguous .",
    "one way to resolve this dilemma is to adopt the `` triangle '' initial condition in which there are 3 nodes in a triangle with cyclic connections between nodes .",
    "this leads to the correct attachment rate for each node for any value of @xmath9 .",
    "we therefore typically use this initial state to generate degree distribution data . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical analysis is simpler for the dimer initial condition .",
    "this state can also be simulated in a simple manner ( for the case @xmath10 ) by a slightly modified gnr construction in which direct attachment to the seed node is not allowed .",
    "it is straightforward to check that this additional rule leads to the correct attachment rates for all the nodes in the network .",
    "0.0 in = 3.2 in 0.1 in 0.0 in = 3.2 in    figure  [ degree ] shows the average degree distribution for attachment rates @xmath15 and @xmath6 with @xmath38 for the triangle initial condition .",
    "this latter value of @xmath9 gives results that are representative for values of @xmath9 close to @xmath39 .",
    "the data exhibits a shoulder at @xmath40 that is much more pronounced when @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ degree](b ) ) .",
    "this shoulder is also at odds with the natural expectation that the average degree distribution should exhibit a monotonic cutoff when @xmath0 becomes of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "this shoulder turns into a clearly - resolved peak that exhibits relatively good data collapse when the degree distribution is re - expressed in the scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ nkscal ] ) ( fig .",
    "[ degree - scaling ] ) .",
    "conversely , the magnitude of the peak diminishes rapidly when @xmath9 is positive and becomes imperceptible for @xmath42 .    0.0 in = 3.0 in    in the following two sections",
    ", we will attempt to understand this anomalous feature of the degree distribution by studying the rate equations for the node degrees of finite networks .",
    "we focus on the case of the linear attachment rate @xmath15 and briefly quote corresponding results for other attachment rates . in the continuum approach ,",
    "@xmath2 is treated as continuously varying .",
    "then the change in the average degree distribution satisfies the rate equation @xmath43 we assume the dimer initial state ",
    "two nodes connected by a single link so that @xmath44 .    equations ( [ nkn ] )",
    "are recursive and can be solved sequentially , starting with @xmath45 .",
    "explicit results for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , are given in appendix a. these expressions show that the dominant contribution in the @xmath3 limit is linear in @xmath2 and this corresponds to the solution in eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) . indeed , if we substitute @xmath48 into eqs .",
    "( [ nkn ] ) , we obtain the recursion @xmath49 , whose solution is eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) . from the first few @xmath46 , it is easy to see that the first correction to this leading behavior is of the order of @xmath50 . substituting @xmath51 into eqs .",
    "( [ nkn ] ) and keeping the first two terms in each @xmath46 , we find @xmath52 .",
    "continuing this procedure systematically , we arrive at the expansion : @xmath53 in general , the right - hand side contains @xmath54 terms which can be written more succinctly as @xmath55 the coefficients @xmath56 $ ] may be obtained by imposing the initial condition @xmath57 as each @xmath46 is computed ; a simpler way of obtaining these coefficients will be explained below .",
    "note that expansion ( [ nkn ] ) is asymptotic because successive terms decrease only when @xmath58 .    a more convenient way to solve eqs .",
    "( [ nkn ] ) is in terms of the generating function @xmath59 multiplying eq .",
    "( [ nkn ] ) by @xmath60 and summing over @xmath0 , the generating function satisfies the following partial differential equation @xmath61 the initial condition is @xmath62 , corresponding to a starting point of two nodes and a single connecting link .",

    ". therefore @xmath75 and finally @xmath76 using @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we re - express the generating function in term of the original variables @xmath79    we are primarily interested in the degree distribution for nodes whose degree is of the order of @xmath80 .",
    "this part of the distribution can be extracted from the limiting behavior of the generating function @xmath81 as @xmath82 from below . since the interesting range is @xmath83 , it is convenient to write @xmath84 and keep @xmath85 finite while taking @xmath86 limit",
    ". we simplify still further by eliminating the contribution to the generating function from the power - law tail of @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we consider the modified generating function @xmath88 which is constructed so that the derivatives multiply the degree distribution by just the right factors to eliminate the power law tail",
    ". the leading behavior of this modified generating function will therefore provide the scaling function @xmath89 of eq .",
    "( [ nkscal ] ) .",
    "we now substitute eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) and the anticipated scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ nkscal ] ) into the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gen3n ] ) and replace the sum by an integral .",
    "this gives the laplace transform of the scaling function times a prefactor , @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) , we compute the derivative on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gen3n ] ) . in the @xmath86 limit",
    ", this derivative becomes @xmath92 with @xmath93 this is just the laplace transform of the scaling function . inverting the laplace",
    "transform then yields @xmath94 notice that the coefficients @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) can be obtained by expanding @xmath96 in a taylor series .",
    "this is a much simpler approach than solving each @xmath12 directly .",
    "an important feature of the degree distribution is that it depends significantly on the initial condition .",
    "for example , for the triangle initial condition , solving eq .",
    "( [ gn ] ) subject to @xmath97 , or @xmath98 , yields @xmath99 repeating the steps used to deduce the scaling function ( [ fscal ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) , we now find @xmath100 therefore small differences in the initial condition translate to discrepancies of the order of @xmath101 in the degree distribution of a finite network of @xmath2 links .",
    "thus the properties of the nodes with the largest degrees are quite sensitive to the first few growth steps of the network ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    while this initial condition dependence is real , there is also a spurious aspect to this effect .",
    "this may be illustrated by considering the linear trimer initial condition @xmath102@xmath102@xmath102 .",
    "this is the unique outcome of the dimer initial condition after one node has been added .",
    "these two initial conditions should therefore lead to the same degree distribution .",
    "however , for the linear trimer initial state ( @xmath103 ) the continuum approach gives the scaling function , @xmath104 which is distinct from eq .",
    "( [ fscal ] ) !",
    "this anomaly highlights one basic limitation of the continuum formulation .    finally , we mention that parallel results can be obtained for the general case of the shifted linear attachment rate , @xmath6 . the rate equation for the average degree distribution",
    "is @xmath105 where @xmath106 . to compute @xmath107 we use the sum rules @xmath108 ( every link contributes twice to the total degree ) , as well as @xmath109 ( for any tree initial condition ) or @xmath110 ( for an initial condition that has the topology of a single cycle ) .",
    "to simplify final formulae , we use the latter topology ( specifically , the triangle initial condition ) so that @xmath111 .    solving the above rate equations successively , we find that the first two terms in the asymptotic series for @xmath112 are @xmath113 with @xmath114 the corresponding leading behaviors are @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "thus the two contributions to the degree distribution in eq .",
    "( [ nkaw - soln ] ) are comparable when @xmath117 .",
    "this value coincides with maximal degree @xmath17 that is obtained by the extreme value condition @xmath118 .",
    "once again the degree distribution is described by a scaling function in the dimensionless variable @xmath119 .",
    "we now turn now to the discrete approach for the network evolution .",
    "that is , one link is introduced at each discrete time step ; this corresponds exactly to what occurs in the simulation .",
    "we again focus on the caes of the linear attachment rate @xmath15 .",
    "we first treat in detail the case of nodes of degree one and then extend our approach to nodes of higher degrees .",
    "finally , we give a scaling description for the degree distribution itself .",
    "the number of nodes of degree one , @xmath120 , is a random variable that changes according to @xmath121 after each node addition event .",
    "that is , with probability @xmath122 , a newly - introduced node attaches to a node of degree one ; in this case , the number of nodes of degree one does not change . conversely , with probability @xmath123 , the new node attaches to a node of degree greater than one and @xmath124 thus increases by one .",
    "therefore @xmath125 from which @xmath126 we take the initial condition @xmath127 .",
    "we solve this recursion in terms of the generating function @xmath128 .",
    "we therefore multiply eq .",
    "( [ n1av ] ) by @xmath129 and sum over @xmath130 to convert this recursion into the differential equation @xmath131 solving eq .",
    "( [ xz ] ) subject to the initial condition @xmath132 gives @xmath133 finally , we expand @xmath134 in a taylor series in @xmath135 to obtain @xmath136 the leading term is identical to that in the continuum approach ( cf .  appendix a ) , but the coefficient of the correction term is @xmath137 , compared to @xmath138 in the continuum approach .",
    "the discrete approach is also suited to analyzing higher moments of the random variable @xmath120 .",
    "the second moment @xmath139 plays an especially important role as we can then obtain the variance @xmath140 and thereby quantify fluctuations . from eq .",
    "( [ n1 ] ) this second moment @xmath141 obeys the following recursion formula @xmath142 the solution to this recursion is outlined in appendix  b and the final result is @xmath143 in the large @xmath2 limit , we use stirling s formula to give , for the variance , @xmath144    to obtain the entire probability distribution @xmath145 one must solve @xmath146 by the markov nature of the process , @xmath145 should approach a gaussian distribution in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "numerically , we indeed find a gaussian distribution with a peak at @xmath147 and dispersion @xmath148 in agreement with our theoretical results for @xmath149 and @xmath139 .      for @xmath150 , the random variable @xmath151 changes according to @xmath152 at each node addition event .",
    "again , because of the markov nature of this process , we anticipate that @xmath4 approaches a gaussian distribution for every _ fixed _ degree @xmath0 ; therefore , we only need calculate @xmath153 and @xmath154 to infer the asymptotic distribution . to determine the first moment ,",
    "we repeat the steps described in detail for @xmath155 and obtain the recursion formula @xmath156 the solution to this recursion is given in appendix  c and explicit formulae for @xmath12 for @xmath157 are also quoted .",
    "qualitatively , these results closely correspond to the asymptotic series for @xmath153 in the continuum formulation ( eq .",
    "( [ nkn ] ) ) but with somewhat different coefficients in the correction terms .",
    "the determination of the second moment @xmath158 is more complicated because it is coupled to @xmath159 , which in turn is coupled to @xmath160 , _",
    "etc_. however , we can still determine @xmath158 for small @xmath0 ( appendix  d ) .",
    "from the structure of the rate equations , our general conclusion is that @xmath161 .",
    "therefore the distribution of @xmath1 approaches a gaussian for each @xmath0 as @xmath3 .      in close analogy with sec .",
    "iii , we now obtain the generating function for @xmath12 , from which the exact scaling function in eq .",
    "( [ nkscal ] ) can be deduced .",
    "since eq .",
    "( [ nkav ] ) involves two discrete variables , @xmath0 and @xmath2 , it proves useful to introduce the two - variable generating function @xmath162 the governing equation for @xmath163 that is obtained from eq .",

    "a similar result for a related network model was found previously by dorogovtsev et al .",
    "notice that the exact form for @xmath89 vanishes much more quickly than predicted by the continuum approach .",
    "when @xmath177 , the continuum approach gives @xmath178 while the exact average degree distribution has a gaussian large - degree tail @xmath179    the scaling function in eq .",

    "we now turn to higher moments of the degree distribution , as well as the fluctuation in these quantities between different realizations of the network . while the zeroth and first moments of the degree distribution are simply related to the total number of links for _ any _ network topology , the higher moments are not so simply characterized , but instead reflect the power - law tail of the degree distribution .",
