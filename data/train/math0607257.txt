    "mathematical modelling of eddy current problems often involves multiple conductors with various sizes .",
    "typically , electrotechnical devices involve thin conductors as wires or coils as well as massive conductors . numerical solution of such problems may then encounter serious difficulties in the choice of the domain meshes which can in particular lead to ill conditioning . asymptotic analysis of these problems appears as an efficient tool to obtain limit problems that are simpler to solve and better conditioned .",
    "we consider , in the present work , a two - dimensional eddy current problem , formulated in terms of a scalar potential in the whole plane .",
    "the electrically conducting domain consists in a  thick \" conductor @xmath8 and two  thin \" domains assumed to carry the same current with opposite sign . in terms of the current conservation principle , this means that these inductors are assumed to be virtually _ linked at the infinity_. the derivation of the model for thin inductors is obtained by assuming that these domains are of small diameters of order @xmath9 .",
    "we show that taking the limit when these diameters tend to zero leads to a singular elliptic problem , the singularity being due to the presence of dirac measures .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : we start in section 2 by deriving the considered eddy current model from a 3-d model .",
    "we emphasize on a careful modelling that takes into account the total current flowing in the inductors . in section 3 ,",
    "we state the main convergence result and prove it through some preliminary lemmas .",

    "let @xmath10 denote a cylindrical conductor where @xmath8 is a domain in @xmath11 with a smooth boundary @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the domain @xmath8 is the union of three connected domains @xmath13 with respective boundaries @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( see figure 1 ) , and that the closures of the domains @xmath13 are disjointed .",
    "we shall also deal with the complement @xmath16 of @xmath8 .",

    "moreover , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the electric conductivity and the magnetic permeability .",
    "we assume for the sake of simplicity that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are positive constants . in order to take advantage of the geometry of @xmath23 , we seek unknowns in the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the canonical basis of @xmath26 .",
