    "neglecting tiny isospin - violating effects induced by the mass differences @xmath242 and @xmath243 as well as the life time difference @xmath244 , we get from ( 5.6 ) that @xcite ( b^0_d|d^0 ^ 0 ) ^2 b(b^+_u|d^0^+ ) . since @xmath245 and @xmath246 have been measured @xcite , we are able to obtain the lower bound of @xmath247 model - independently , as numerically illustrated in fig .",
    "this result implies that the decay mode @xmath231 should be detected soon .    in practice , it is necessary to sum over all possible decay modes of the same nature as @xmath231 , such as @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",

    "\\(a ) the uncertainties associated with the approximate relations ( 2.3 ) , ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.7 ) are expected to be less than @xmath254 , as a consequence of the significant hierarchy of quark mass values",

    "\\(c ) within the standard model , we have @xmath255 to an excellent degree of accuracy .",
    "the deviation of @xmath194 from @xmath256 might not be negligibly small , provided the penguin effects in @xmath186 were not as small as we naively expected .",
    "new physics in @xmath20-@xmath21 mixing could give rise to an observable difference between @xmath227 ( @xmath228 ) and @xmath229 or between @xmath131 and @xmath194 .",
    "new physics in @xmath18-@xmath19 mixing would affect all the five @xmath0-violating phases under discussion , but could not be isolated from the proposed measurements .    of course , we have assumed unitarity of the @xmath257 km matrix in the above discussions .",
