    "there has been substantial recent interest in the study of colliding plasmas , motivated by a range of research topics including the potential effects of colliding hohlraum plasmas@xcite on cross - beam energy transfer@xcite in inertial confinement fusion,@xcite collisional and collisionless - shock studies,@xcite and applications such as pulsed laser deposition or laser - induced breakdown spectroscopy.@xcite some of these colliding - plasma interactions can be in a regime that is neither purely collisional , in which the plasma can be approximated as a fluid , nor purely collisionless , in which classical collisions between particles can be neglected , a situation which complicates modeling.@xcite    in this work , we present time- and space - resolved diagnostic measurements of the overlapping region between two head - on - merging supersonic plasma jets . from the measurements",
    ", we deduce that ( a )  the jets initially interpenetrate in a collisionless manner and then subsequently stagnate and ( b ) the transition from interpenetration to stagnation is due to a rising mean - ionization state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total ion - plus - neutral density , that drastically reduces the inter - jet ion  ion collisional mean free path ( @xmath2 ) .",
