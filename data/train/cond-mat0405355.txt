    "periodic potentials , usually called optical lattices ( ol ) , which are induced by interference of laser beams illuminating a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , are widely used in experimental studies of becs .",
    "not only one - dimensional ( 1d ) ols , but also their multidimensional counterparts are available in the experiment , see refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "an important type of nonlinear excitations that becs may support are bright solitons ( in this paper , following the trend commonly adopted in the current literature , we apply the term soliton \" to robust localized objects , without implying integrability of the underlying mathematical model ) . in an effectively 1d ( cigar - shaped )",
    "condensate , solitons have been observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "creation of solitons in a bec confined in the ol has not been reported yet , although splitting of wave packets in a @xmath2rb condensate , loaded in a cylindrical trap with an superimposed 1d ol potential , which was reported recently @xcite , might be a manifestation of transient soliton dynamics .",
    "parallel to the experiments , many theoretical predictions for bec solitons in ols have been reported .",
    "in particular , attention was attracted to a possibility to create _ gap solitons _",
    ", that are expected as a result of the interplay of the ol potential and _ repulsive _ interaction between atoms in the bec @xcite . while only 1d solitons have been thus far observed in becs , it was predicted that ols may support multidimensional solitons of the gap type as well @xcite .",
    "a prediction which is especially relevant to feasible experiments is that ols can also stabilize multidimensional solitons in becs with attraction between atoms ( because of the possibility of collapse , such solitons are unstable without a support potential ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , 2d bright solitons carrying intrinsic vorticity can be stabilized too by the ol in the 2d case @xcite .",
    "various other properties of ol - supported solitons were studied too @xcite .",
    "similar localized objects are expected in a different physical setting , in the form of 2d optical spatial solitons in nonlinear photonic crystals ( npcs ) @xcite . in optical media ,",
    "an effective lattice potential is induced by periodic modulation of the local refractive index in the transverse direction(s ) @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to use a _ virtual lattice _",
    ", induced in a photorefractive medium by a transverse array of strong coherent laser beams ; the latter arrangement has made it possible to observe 2d spatial solitons in a real experiment @xcite , as well as their vorticity - carrying counterparts @xcite .",
    "most theoretical studies of solitons in the above - mentioned models did not address their motion .",
    "in a recent work @xcite , we considered in detail the motion and collisions of 1d solitons in the ol - equipped model in both cases of the attractive and repulsive cubic nonlinearity . in that work ,",
    "the ol potential was combined with an external parabolic ( harmonic ) trapping potential , which corresponds to the real situation in any bec experiment .",
    "direct simulations of the corresponding effective 1d gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation had demonstrated that , in either case ( self - focusing or self - defocusing nonlinearity ) , the soliton travels freely through the lattice if its norm ( number of atoms ) is below a certain critical value ; above this value , it gets trapped by the ol .",
    "depending on parameters , collisions between moving solitons are either elastic , or lead to their fusion .",
    "the most intriguing result concerns the motion of the soliton in the parabolic trap : in the case of attraction , the soliton behaves , as it may be naturally expected , as a quasi - particle in the harmonic - oscillator potential .",
    "however , in the case of repulsion , the soliton of the gap type is expelled by the parabolic trap , while it is stably confined by an _ anti - trap _ ( repulsive parabolic potential ) .",
    "this result , which calls for direct experimental verification , was supported by analytical considerations which demonstrate that the effective mass of the gap soliton , regarded as a quasi - particle , is _ negative _ ( in the case of the usual soliton , corresponding to the attractive nonlinearity , the effective mass is positive ) .",
    "an issue of straightforward interest is to extend these results to the 2d case , which is quite relevant , as experiments with 2d solitons in becs seem possible right now . besides that , the problem is also of direct relevance for steering spatial optical soliton in npc media . in  this work ,",
    "we focus on the 2d bec model with repulsive interactions , as this case is most relevant to the experiment , and produces most interesting physical results .",
    "first , we demonstrate that broad localized states , which we call loosely bound ( lb ) ones , may be represented as a product of a linear bloch function , defined by the ol , which is taken close to the edge to the corresponding brillouin zone ( bz ) , and a slowly varying envelope function , which obeys an asymptotic nonlinear equation that does not contain ol .",
    "such a representation makes it possible to demonstrate analytically that the effective mass of the lb state is negative . this way , we find not only fundamental lb states , but also ones carrying vorticity , whose mass is negative too ; the existence of 2d localized vortices in the repulsive model has not been reported before . in direct simulations ,",
    "the  lb vortex features actual rotation around its center .",
    "simulations confirm the stability of the localized lb states , and demonstrate that they can move freely through the ol . in particular , both fundamental and vortex lb states can be readily set in elliptic circular motion in the anti - trapping potential , the frequency of the circulations being very accurately predicted by the asymptotic equation .",
    "direct simulations ( as well as the asymptotic equation ) demonstrate an abrupt transition ( without hysteresis ) from the lb states to much stronger localized tight - bound ( tb ) ones with the increase of the norm ( number of atoms ) .",
    "the tb states are nothing else but the 2d gap solitons , that were first found in ref .",
    "the lb - tb transition also takes place for the vortices , thus revealing the existence of new tb vortex solitons of the gap type .",
    "it is additionally found that the tb vortices undergo an intrinsic transition to a more symmetric shape with subsequent increase of the norm . unlike their lb counterparts",
    ", the tb solitons can not move , being strongly pinned by the ol .",
    "we also construct lb states , starting from the linear bloch function close to the bz center . in that case , the effective mass is positive , no transition to tb solitons occurs ( as they do not exist ) , and the lb states , both fundamental and vortex ones , are mobile , which is accurately described by the corresponding asymptotic equation .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the analysis based on the derivation of the asymptotic equations for the lb states , with both negative and positive mass , is presented in section 2 .",
    "numerical results for static solitons ( however , including rotation of the vortex lb states ) , such as the lb - tb transitions , are summarized in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we present numerical and analytical results concerning motion of the lb states , for the cases of the negative and positive mass .",

    "10 displays results obtained with the initial condition @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the stationary lb state with @xmath156 and @xmath157 , whose peak position is located at the central point , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 . in other words , this initial condition implies that the localized state is pushed by shifting its center in the @xmath19 direction , and giving it an initial momentum along @xmath20 .",
    "we define the instantaneous position of the center of the localized state as @xmath160 .",
    "figure 11(a ) demonstrates that , as a result , the center of the lb state moves along an elliptic trajectory [ in the case displayed in fig .",
    "11(a ) , the simulations were run up to the time @xmath161 , while the numerically measured period of the elliptic motion was @xmath162 , i.e. , the localized state has completed one full circulation ( in the clockwise direction , since the initial velocity @xmath163 is negative ) . to make the difference from the strongly pinned tb solitons clearer , fig .",
    "11(b ) displays a result of a similar attempt to set in motion the localized state of the tb type . as a result , initially its center moves irregularly , and is then trapped by the ol potential .",
    "many other runs of the simulations produced quite similar results ; in particular , the eccentricity of the elliptic orbit depends on the initial push , and effectively 1d periodic motion along straight lines through the center of the domain are possible too . in this connection , it is relevant to mention that , although the underlying ol makes the medium anisotropic , simulations do not reveal any dependence of the frequency on the direction of the 1d oscillations ( the frequency of the elliptic motion does not depend on the orientation of the ellipse either ) .    ) and negative effective mass ( @xmath164 ) in the _ anti - trap _ with @xmath25 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath126 , and the norm of the localized state is @xmath157",
    ". for comparison , panel ( b ) displays an attempt to set in motion a tightly - bound soliton with @xmath165.,width=384 ]    the periodic motion of the lb state can be easily described within the framework of the asymptotic equation ( [ asympt ] ) . in that case , one can demonstrate that motion for the center @xmath166 of the localized state , which is treated as a rigid quasi - particle , obeys the newton s equation of motion , @xmath167 [ @xmath47 is the same effective mass as in eq .",
    "( [ asympt ] ) , while the right - hand side is the potential force generated by the parabolic ( anti-)trap ] .",
    "equation ( [ newton ] ) indeed describes the observed motion with a good accuracy .",
    "for instance , in the case displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( a ) , eq .",
    "( [ newton ] ) predicts the period of the motion , @xmath168 which should be compared to the above - mentioned numerically found period , @xmath169.@xmath170    as it was explained above , the localized states found close to the bz center are actually always of the lb type , hence one may expect that they may move freely too .",
    "this is indeed observed in simulations .",
    "typical examples are displayed in fig .",
    "12 , for the localized states with @xmath94 and @xmath90 ( quite a similar motion mode was observed for the vortex with @xmath96 ) .",
    "the trajectory corresponds to anti - clockwise elliptic circulation in this case , as the initial velocity @xmath171 is positive .",
    "we stress that the vortex lb states readily exhibit circular motion with the same period as their counterparts with @xmath94 , and the analytical prediction for the circulation period , based on eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , is very accurate in this case too .",
    "for example , in both cases ( @xmath94 and @xmath98 ) shown in fig .  12",
    ", the predicted period is @xmath172 , while the one extracted from the numerical data is @xmath173 .    , and in the ordinary trap with @xmath27 ( and @xmath174 ) .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the corresponding time dependence of the central coordinate @xmath175 of the moving localized state . in panel",
    "( c ) , the same dependence is shown for the circular motion of the vortex with @xmath98.,width=480 ]",
    "in this work , we have developed analysis of dynamics of nonlinear localized excitations in two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with repulsive interactions , which are subjected to the action of the optical lattice ( ol ) combined with the external parabolic potential .",
    "first , we have shown , in an analytical form , that broad ( loosely bound , lb ) localized states , based on the 2d bloch function near the edge of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , feature a negative effective mass ( while the mass of the lb localized states is positive near the bz center ) .",
    "the negative - mass pulse can not be confined by the usual trap , but it is held by an inverted parabolic potential ( _ anti - trap _ ) .",
    "direct simulations have demonstrated that the lb states ( including vortices ) are stable and can freely move on top of the ol , and the frequency of their periodic motion along an elliptic orbit in the anti - trapping potential agrees very well with the analytical prediction , which treats the lb solitons as quasi - particles . besides that , the lb vortices feature rotation around the center . with the increase of the number of atoms ,",
    "an abrupt transition occurs , from the negative - mass lb states to their tightly bound ( tb ) counterparts ; unlike the lb states , the tb solitons are rigidly pinned by the ol .",
    "the positive - mass lb states ( including vortices ) , constructed near the bz center , are stable and move freely too .",
    "further dynamical effects may be considered in the 2d situation , such as collisions between moving solitons .",
    "in fact , various types of collisions are possible , such as between zero - vorticity solitons and vortices , as well as between lb and tb states with the negative mass ( the latter is possible in the presence of the anti - trap ) . on the other hand ,",
    "interactions between solitons with positive and negative mass are precluded , as only one type of the solitons may be confined by a given trapping or anti - trapping potential .",
    "the consideration of collisions is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we expect that similar lb and tb states may be found in becs subject to the action of the 3d ( three - dimensional ) ol potential .",
    "however , simulations of the corresponding 3d gp equation is a rather difficult problem .",
    "estimates for physical parameters at which the predicted effects may be observed are similar to those in the 1d counterpart of the model @xcite .",
    "in particular , a circular motion of the lb soliton in the anti - trap may be expected at a frequency @xmath176 hz in a domain of the diameter @xmath177 mm ( @xmath178 spatial periods of the ol ) .",
    "the transition from the lb to tb solitons is expected when the number of atoms in the condensate attains the values between @xmath179 for the @xmath94 states and @xmath180 for the vortex with @xmath96 .    in the experiment , the lb  and tb localized states are expected to form spontaneously from a properly chosen number of atoms loaded in the appropriate potential , as there is virtually no overlap between these two types of the states . as concerns vortex states",
    ", they may be created using the well - known technique of optical stirring .",
    "the effects predicted in this work for the bec can also take place with spatial optical solitons in bulk photonic crystals .",
