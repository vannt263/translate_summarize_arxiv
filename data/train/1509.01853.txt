    "the lefschetz fibrations are fundamental objects to study in @xmath16-dimensional topology and they serve as a powerful tool for understanding the geometry and topology of symplectic @xmath16-manifolds . it was shown by s. donaldson that every closed symplectic @xmath16-manifold admits a lefschetz pencil , which can be blown up at its base points to yield a lefschetz fibration @xcite , and conversely , r. gompf has shown that the total space @xmath19 of a genus @xmath20 lefschetz fibration admits a symplectic structure , provided that the homology class of the regular fiber is nonzero in @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "let us recall from @xcite that , given a lefschetz fibration @xmath22 , one can associate to it a word @xmath23 in the mapping class group of the regular fiber composed only from right - handed dehn twists .",
    "conversely , given such a right handed dehn twist factorization @xmath24 in the mapping class group @xmath25 of the closed orientable surface of genus @xmath20 , one can explicitly construct genus @xmath20 lefschetz fibration over @xmath4 with the given monodromy .    in recent literature ( @xcite ) , several authors have applied various relations in the mapping class group or luttinger surgery to construct new lefschetz fibrations with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "however , the exotic symplectic @xmath16-manifolds obtained in @xcite do not have very small topology as one may desire .",

    "our other motivations comes from the study of genus two lefschetz fibration with small number of singular fibers , and the relationship between the minimality and the fiber - sum decomposability of lefschetz fibrations ( see the remark  [ decomp ] ) .    in this artcle",

    "for @xmath45 , the total space @xmath5 is non - khler symplectic @xmath16-manifold .",
    "this follows from the restriction on the fundamental group of minimal khler surfaces with the invariants @xmath46 .    in the last section of our article",
