    "coronal dimmings , or `` transient coronal holes '' as they are sometimes known , have provoked great curiosity in the solar physics community since their initial observation with skylab @xcite .",
    "they were first noticed as a rapid intensity reduction of the soft x - ray corona around active regions , and have subsequently been connected to coronal mass ejections ( cmes ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , coronal dimmings are now viewed as the residual footprint of the cme in the corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the radio and plasma signatures of which are observed in interplanetary space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the connection between dimming and cme has been quantitatively fortified by the recent statistical surveys of @xcite and @xcite using euv instrumentation on the _ soho _ spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the former of these surveys indicates that at least 50% of front - sided cmes have associated dimming regions , while the latter stressed that the relationship between the two phenomena is one that grows considerably when only narrowband spectroscopic observations are considered .",
    "therefore , rigorously establishing the poorly understood physical connection between cmes and coronal dimmings using detailed spectroscopic measurement is a must .",
    "we focus our analysis on observations of noaa ar  10930 from the extreme - ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( eis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on _ hinode _ @xcite between 19:00ut december 14 2006 and 06:00ut december 15 2006 .",
    "this time period saw an x - class flare and a @xmath01000km / s halo cme emanating from this complex active region at around 20:12  ut ( relative to soho / eit imaging ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this letter",
    ", we expand on the analysis of @xcite , exploiting rare detailed spectroscopic measurements of a dimming region .",
    "eis provides a tantalizing look at the dynamic behavior of euv emission lines , and their non - thermal line widths in particular , over the course of the eruption .",
    "the interpretation of the dynamic evolution of the non - thermal line widths presented in this letter forms a challenge to the rapidly increasing sophistication of numerical cme models , in that they need to cope with the complex thermodynamics of the cme source region .",
    "the dataset of interest comprises of three spectroheliogram `` raster '' observations ( 19:20 - 21:34ut , 01:15 - 03:30 , 04:10 - 06:24ut ) , targeted at the following edge of the active region that is the source of the event studied .",
    "each eis raster is comprised of 256 horizontal ( west to east ) mirror mechanism steps with the 1 slit at a spacing of 1 and a height of 256 and has information in a nine 24 pixel wide spectral window . at a spectral resolution of 22.3m , and wavelength of 195 ,",
    "one pixel on the detector is equivalent to a velocity of @xmath034  km / s .    for brevity",
    ", we present the analysis of the 195.12 emission line as the eis rasters can be supported by the broadband imaging from _",
    "soho_/eit in the 195 passband at its regular 12 minute `` cme watch '' cadence .",
    "the analysis of other strong and ( relatively ) spectrally clean emission lines observed in this period ( 202.04 and 284.16 ) will be published in a later article @xcite .",
    "once the data are reduced , we need to extract the physical measurements from the emission line spectra . to do this",
    ", we choose to fit the spectral profiles at each spatial pixel at each raster step with a single gaussian ( assuming a linear continuum background variation in the spectral window ) and , to ensure the highest quality fits , we use a combination of genetic algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and downhill convergence methods .",
    "upon completion of the gaussian fitting process , we have spatial maps of the line ( peak ) intensity , line position and @xmath1 width @xmath2 of the profile ( measured in spectral pixels ) . the map of the non - thermal line width @xmath3 ( in km / s ) of the emission line profile is determined using the quadratic relationship : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the instrumental width ( taken to be 2.5 pixels full - width half - max ; * ? ? ? * ) , @xmath6 is the thermal width for an ion of mass @xmath7 and peak formation temperature of @xmath8 ( assuming that the ion and electron temperatures are equal ) , @xmath9 ( 195.12 ) is the rest wavelength of the line , and @xmath10 ( 22.3m ) is the the spectral pixel scale and @xmath11 is the speed of light .    in order to compare the three eis rasters , as well as with the broadband eit images",
    ", we must de - rotate the coordinates of each slit position to the start - time of the first raster using the mapping method of @xcite .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "f1 , where the monochromatic eis image is inlaid in the closest eit image to the start of the first raster ( 19:13ut ) .",
    "figure  f2 shows the evolution of the line intensities before ( 19:20ut ; panel a ) , and at two stages during ( 01:15 ; panel b - 04:10ut ; panel c ) , the dimming event .",
    "panel d shows the percentage change in the line intensity between the pre- and first post - eruption rasters [ ( b - a)/a ] , while panels e and f show the percentage intensity change between pre- and second post - eruption rasters [ ( c - a)/a ] and that between the two post - eruption rasters [ ( c - b)/b ] .",
    "the white contours overplotted on panels d and e isolate the strongest dimming region , where we see a reduction in intensity of 75% .",
    "in fact , we see that , from eis perspective , there is a sizable reduction in intensity to the south and east of ar  10930 ; much of that area shows a drop in intensity between 25 and 50% , which would classify this event as a `` deep '' dimming in the terminology of @xcite .",
    "we should note here that the choice of a 75% reduction in intensity is arbitrary , but that it outlines a region of significant change of the emission from magnetic field lines rooted in the region running from [ 440 , -200 ] to [ 480 , -120 ] . in panel f of fig .",
    "f2 , we see that the intensities are increasing over almost the entire region , recovering slowly as is typical of coronal dimmings @xcite . this behavior has been associated with the closure of the overlying corona and return of plasma heating to the region ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use the observed intensity drop to compute a rough estimate of the drop in electron density in the dimming region . for a resonance line",
    "whose intensity varies as @xmath12 , a 75% reduction in emission corresponds to a 44% reduction of electron density .",
    "the apparent intensity drop and slow recovery of the region is mirrored by the _ soho_/eit image sequence ( see the online edition of journal for movie accompanying fig .",
    "figure  f3 mirrors fig .",
    "f2 , except it shows the evolution of the non - thermal line width ( @xmath3 ) before ( panel a ) and over the course of the dimming event ( panels b and c ) .",
    "again , panels d through f show the percentage change in @xmath3 between the pre- and first post - eruption rasters [ ( b - a)/a ] , the pre- and second post - eruption rasters [ ( c - a)/a ] , and between the two post - eruption rasters [ ( c - b)/b ] .",
    "immediately , we see a dynamic evolution of @xmath3 in the contour - outlined dimming region over the course of the event . comparing panels a and b ( and d ) , we see a large increase ( @xmath015% ) in @xmath3 , largely concentrated in and around the perimeter of the 75% reduction contour . as the dimming event progresses",
    "( comparing panels c , a and e ) , there continue to be regions of difference in @xmath3 late in the lifetime of the dimming , becoming more spatially compact and following the contraction of the intensity decrease contour . in panel f",
    ", we see that @xmath3 , much as in fig .",
    "f2 , appears to be slowly recovering to pre - eruption levels , and we find that other ( spectrally clean ) coronal spectral lines observed by eis in this region exhibit the same dynamic behavior of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite reported on the considerable ( relative ) blue - shifted doppler velocities ( @xmath040km / s ) that emanated from the dimming region and are indicative of significant coronal outflows while the region is open .",
    "we believe that these outflows are real , are consistent with the measurements discussed above , and reinforce our belief that the transient dimmings are really short lived coronal holes .",
    "unfortunately , the relative nature of the euv doppler measurements leaves some ambiguity in the absolute magnitude of these flows .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that the non - thermal line widths of these hot coronal emission lines also evolve dynamically , and are very responsive to the large - scale cme - related intensity fluctuations that historically constitute a coronal dimming event .",
    "the rapid growth of the coronal non - thermal line widths appears to be tied to the post - cme evacuation of the dimming region .",
    "further , this rapid growth of non - thermal line widths is followed by a slow decrease , with values beginning to approach their pre - eruption levels - a result of the closing and gradual filling of the corona as the cme cuts its magnetic ties with the sun @xcite .    in an effort to explain this evolution , we invoke the ubiquitous presence of alfvnic plasma motions in the chromosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their likely connection to the non - thermal line widths measured in the upper atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed increase in non - thermal line width in the dimming region is consistent with sub - resolution doppler broadening resulting from the increased amplitude of alfvn waves in an increasingly rarefied plasma . for a constant volumetric energy flux in a uniform ,",
    "unchanging , magnetic field , the amplitude of undamped alfvn waves should grow , as the density drops , by a factor of @xmath13 . further , as the corona begins to refill , the wave amplitudes should shrink back to their nominal ( pre - event closed magnetic topology ) value , precisely as we have observed in this instance .",
    "we stress that the dynamic behavior of the 195.12 non - thermal line widths is mimicked in the other spectrally isolated eis lines studied for this event , but not shown in this letter @xcite .    the likely role of alfvn waves in the acceleration of the fast solar wind @xcite that originates in coronal holes and their observed connection following the passage of cmes in interplanetary space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is evocative .",
    "if a coronal dimming is indeed a transiently evolving coronal hole , then it _ must _ carry some , if not all , of the same spectral , thermodynamic and compositional characteristics of its longer lived brethren .",
    "this implies that dimming regions are sources of fast wind streams blowing behind  in the magnetic envelopes of  cmes .",
    "such wind streams should `` switch - on '' on a timescale commensurate with the alfvn crossing time of the region and `` blow '' for a length of time commensurate with that required for the open magnetic flux behind the cme to close again . if this conjecture is indeed true , we would expect that the amount of unsigned magnetic flux in the dimming region should correlate strongly with the speed of the eventual interplanetary cmes seen in situ - scaling with the amount of open wave - carrying magnetic flux @xcite - and observed by @xcite .",
    "the potential link between cmes , coronal dimmings and induced fast solar wind streams will require an increase in the sophistication of current numerical cme models to capture the rapidly evolving complex thermodynamic state of the lower boundary .",
    "only then will we be able to assess the impact of the following wind stream on the cme .",
    "such measures are essential to correctly estimate the propagation speed of cmes and necessary for accurate space weather predictions .",
    "we surmise that the combination of the observed effect dictates that the evolution of the cme and the nearly instantaneous release of a fast wind stream are intrinsically coupled .",
    "this goes some way to explaining the frequent in situ observations of chromospheric compositional characteristics and the significant alfvnic modulation that closely follows the cme in interplanetary space @xcite .",
    "the influence of the dimming region - initiated wind stream on the flight characteristics of the cme remains to be seen .",
    "the hypothesis presented is one that we hope to directly test when the coronal multi - channel polarimeter ( comp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instrument begins regular observation from the mees solar observatory on haleakala early in 2009 .",
