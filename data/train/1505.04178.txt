    "the emission algorithm follows the work of  @xcite and is similar to that described in  @xcite .",

    "energy conservation therefore requires that a small amount of energy is transferred from the laser fields during emission ; as described in  @xcite , this leads to a fractional error in the electron energy of @xmath62 that may be safely neglected .",
    "while synchrotron radiation is directed forward into a cone of opening angle @xmath63  @xcite , we can assume that the photon and electron momenta are collinear , as the electron is always highly relativistic .    between emissions ,",
    "the electron trajectory is determined classically by integrating the lorentz force exerted by the laser fields ( neglecting the beam s space charge field , as described in ) @xmath64 this is implemented using a boris push algorithm  @xcite , so @xmath65 and @xmath21 are calculated at intervals staggered by half a timestep .",

    "the peak field @xmath75 is related to the laser intensity by @xmath76 .",
    "it can be shown from that @xmath12 , which controls photon emission , does not depend on the polarisation of the em field , but only on the angle between the optical axis and the electron momentum @xmath3 .",
    "as such , the choice of polarisation here is arbitrary except that it defines the plane in which the electrons oscillate and so affects the angular distribution of radiation .",
    "this will be a fan of opening angle @xmath77 oriented along the polarisation axis  @xcite .",

    "this is shown in .",
    "this distribution has been chosen as high energy wakefield - accelerated beams typically have large tails that extend to low energy .",
    "they also exhibit an angular divergence of order mrad , but here their initial momenta are directed along @xmath85 .    the charge density of the beam forms a gaussian envelope with @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) where the widths are given in the directions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath90 respectively .",

    "@xmath97 means that the effect of the space charge field can be neglected and each electron s trajectory in the laser pulse may be considered separately .",
    "furthermore , as the typical separation between electrons @xmath98 ( equivalent to 40  ev ) , we can also neglect collective radiation effects when considering gamma ray emission .",
    "we consider the interaction of an intense laser pulse with a gev electron beam , with parameters as described in",
    ". shows the mean energy lost by such an electron beam to gamma rays when colliding with the specified laser pulse .",
    "we find that the total loss reaches its maximum of 120  mev per electron for a head - on collision that occurs a distance @xmath99 along the optical axis from the laser focus , but that the loss to photons with energy @xmath100 is maximised at 0.48  mev per electron for a perfectly - timed collision that occurs at an angle of @xmath101 .    in determining the @xmath102 that maximise the energy emitted to gamma rays",
    ", we must consider three competing factors : a ) the geometric factor in @xmath12 ; b ) each electron s length of interaction with the laser pulse ; and c ) the overlap between the electron beam and laser pulse .",
    "\\a ) arises from the definition of @xmath12 : if @xmath65 and @xmath21 are given by a linearly polarised plane wave and the electron is highly relativistic , travelling at angle @xmath3 to the wave s direction of propagation , then @xmath103 as @xmath12 falls with increasing @xmath3 , colliding the electron with the laser pulse at an angle will have two effects : according to the electron s emission rate is reduced ; and the photons it emits have lower energies , as the tail of the synchrotron spectrum grows non - linearly with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "\\b ) accounts for the importance of ` straggling '  @xcite : as photon emission is probabilistic , some electrons can reach the centre of the laser pulse having lost no energy ; their @xmath12 is then much higher and so too their probability of emitting a single photon with @xmath104 . in this case , the laser pulse is longer along the propagation axis than it is wide , so electrons traversing the pulse at an angle interact with the high intensity field over a shorter distance .",
    "while this reduces the total energy emitted , straggling becomes likelier with a shorter distance to reach the region of highest intensity ; this should increase the yield of the highest energy photons .",
    "we can see the interplay of these two factors in the yield of the highest energy gamma rays , which is maximised for a collision at @xmath101 rather than at @xmath105 .",
    "this can be explained by estimating analytically the average @xmath12 of an electron when it emits its first photon , which balances the reduced geometric factor against increased penetration into the laser pulse as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the latter is likely to be more important than both the geometric factor and the overlap between the beams as it is the emission of the highest energy photons that is most sensitive to straggling  @xcite .",
    "the calculation is given in appendix  b ; for the parameters under consideration here , @xmath12 is maximised for a collision @xmath106 , which is consistent with the peak shown in the right of .",
    "we conclude that it is most important to reduce the length of interaction and so the energy loss in the foot of the pulse to maximise the yield of the highest energy photons .",

    "we can understand this in terms of c ) , the overlap , which controls how many of the beam electrons interact with the laser pulse .",
    "let us compare the total energy emitted in photons to an analytical estimate of the overlap @xmath110 where the beam charge density is as given in and @xmath111 is as given in , taking @xmath112 .",
    "that comparison is plotted in , varying each of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath3 .",
    "we can see that the overlap models the dependence of the yield on @xmath107 and @xmath108 well .",
    "the yield increases with @xmath107 up to @xmath99 because the laser pulse diverges as it propagates away from its focal plane and therefore more electrons encounter the pulse .",
    "for @xmath113 the yield falls because even though more electrons collide with the laser , they do so at lower peak intensity , which reduces their @xmath12 and so their emissivity .",
    "gamma ray production is more sensitive to the perpendicular displacement between the beams @xmath108 than the parallel displacement @xmath107 .",
    "this is because the peak intensity at the electron beam centre falls as @xmath114 for increasing @xmath108 but as @xmath115^{-1}$ ] for increasing @xmath107 ; to reduce the peak intensity by a half requires @xmath116 but only @xmath117 . for @xmath118",
    "there is negligible photon emission because nearly all the electrons have missed the laser pulse .",
    "the overlap between the beams is nearly constant if only @xmath3 is varied ; however , the gamma ray yield is maximised at 80  mev per electron at @xmath119 and falls thereafter .",
    "we can attribute this behaviour to the reduced length of interaction at large @xmath3 , which reduces the energy loss before the electron reaches the pulse centre .",
    "however , this does not increase the gamma ray yield as much as increasing @xmath107 .    we conclude that allowing the laser pulse to diverge over a distance of @xmath37 in a head - on collision is the optimal configuration to produce gamma rays .",
    "this can be achieved experimentally by focussing the high - intensity laser pulse with an optic that has an aperture in it .",
    "provided this aperture is of sufficient size to permit the transmission of the wakefield - driving laser , the electron beam and resultant gamma rays , back - reflection and damage to the optical chain can be avoided .",
    "an analytical fit to the region in which the total gamma ray yield is at least 80% of its maximum value is @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "even though the experiment would be designed for counterpropagation , the angle between the beams will vary from shot to shot due to the pointing variation of both the wakefield - driving and target laser pulses .",
    "shows that to achieve any gamma ray production at @xmath99 , that angle must be less than @xmath122 .",
    "we can understand this requirement by considering the distance of closest approach between the centres of the electron beam and laser pulse @xmath123 ; for @xmath109 , @xmath124 means @xmath125 , the width of the electron beam , and so there is no overlap between the beams .",

    "compares the energy distribution of the gev electron beam described in to its initial energy spectrum for collisions at @xmath127 and @xmath126 .",
    "we can see in that in the former case the spectra are not sufficiently distinguishable , even though there is substantial loss of energy to gamma rays .",
    "that loss is generated by those electrons that have collided with the intense part of the laser pulse ; however , the peak at 1000  mev remains as many electrons miss the laser pulse entirely .",
    "the broad energy spread is caused not only by the range of peak intensities encountered by the electron beam but by the stochastic nature of emission as well : two electrons travelling along the same trajectory will not necessarily lose the same energy .",
    "neitz and di piazza  @xcite showed that this leads to energy broadening even for an electron beam without spatial extent and that radiation reaction manifests itself by ` smearing out ' the initial energy distribution .",
    "if we consider the final state energy distribution for a collision at @xmath128 , enough of the beam interacts with the laser such that the initial peak at 1000  mev is entirely removed . if the electron beam is sufficiently well - characterised , it may be possible to detect radiation reaction by comparing the spectra from shots in the presence and absence of the target laser pulse .",
    "however , even high - quality wakefield - accelerated electron beams do not in general have energy spectra that are reproducible from shot to shot .",

    "resolving the electron s beam areal energy spectrum could be accomplished by allowing to diverge over a long distance as it propagates away from the interaction region .",
    "a single shot would thereby allow the simultaneous measurement of the electron beam energy in the presence and absence of the target laser pulse and so the detection of radiation reaction .",

    "however , d ) shows that a longitudinal displacement , which allows the laser pulse to broaden before the collision takes place , makes the depletion zone less obvious .",
    "this is because the laser interacts with more electrons but at lower peak intensity , spreading the energy loss over a larger region of the electron beam . by considering the amount by which the energy is reduced at the centre of the depletion zone for collisions that take place at @xmath121 , as in",
