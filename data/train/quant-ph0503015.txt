    "there is much current interest in the use of coherent control in order to generate novel matter - radiation states in cavity qed and atom - optics systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , the field of cavity qed has caught the interest of workers in the field of solid - state nanostructures , since effective two - level systems can be fabricated using semiconductor quantum dots , organic molecules and even naturally - occuring biological systems such as the photosynthetic complexes lhi and lhii and in biological imaging setups involving fret ( fluoresence resonance energy transfer ) @xcite .",
    "such nanostructure systems could then be embedded in optical cavities or their equivalent , such as in the gap of a photonic band - gap material @xcite .",
    "we refer to ref .",

    "phase transitions in quantum systems are currently attracting much attention within the solid - state , atomic and quantum information communities @xcite .",
    "most of the focus within the solid - state community has been on phase transitions in electronic systems such as low - dimensional magnets @xcite while in atomic physics there has been much interest in phase transitions in cold atom gases and in atoms coupled to a cavity . in particular , a second - order phase transition , from normal to superradiant , is known to arise in the dicke model which considers @xmath0 two - state atoms ( i.e. ` spins ' or ` qubits ' @xcite ) coupled to an electromagnetic field ( i.e. bosonic cavity mode ) @xcite .",
    "the dicke model itself has been studied within the atomic physics community for fifty years , but has recently caught the attention of solid - state physicists working on arrays of quantum dots , josephson junctions , and magnetoplasmas @xcite .",
    "its extension to quantum chaos @xcite , quantum information @xcite and other exactly solvable models has also been considered recently @xcite .",
    "it has also been conjectured that superradiance could be used as a mechanism for quantum teleportation @xcite .    here",
    "we extend our discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite on the exploration of novel phase transitions in atom - radiation systems exploiting the current levels of experimental expertise in the area of coherent control .",
    "the corresponding experimental set - up can be a cavity - qed , atom - optics , or nanostructure - optics system , whose energy gaps and interactions are tailored to be the required generalization of the well - known dicke model @xcite .",
    "we show that , according to the values of these control parameters , the phase transitions be driven to become first - order .",
    "the well - known dicke model from atom - optics ignores interactions between the constituent two - level systems or ` spins ' @xcite . in atomic systems where each ` spin ' is an atom ,",
    "this is arguably an acceptable approximation if the atoms are neutral _ and _ the atom - atom separation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the atomic diameter .",
    "however there are several reasons why this approximation is unlikely to be valid in typical solid - state systems .",
    "first , the ` spin ' can be represented by any nanostructure ( e.g. quantum dot ) possessing two well - defined energy levels , yet such nanostructures are not typically neutral . hence there will in general be a short - ranged ( due to screening ) electrostatic interaction between neighbouring nanostructures .",
    "second , even if each nanostructure is neutral , the typical separation distance @xmath3 between fabricated and self - organised nanostructures is typically the same as the size of the nanostructure itself .",
    "hence neutral systems such as excitonic quantum dots will still have a significant interaction between nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "motivated by the experimental relevance of ` spin ",
    "spin ' interactions , we introduce and analyze a generalised dicke hamiltonian which is relevant to current experimental setups in both the solid - state and atomic communities @xcite . we show that the presence of transverse spin  spin coupling terms , leads to novel first - order phase transitions associated with super - radiance in the bosonic cavity field . a technologically important example within the solid - state community would be an array of quantum dots coupled to an optical mode .",
    "this mode could arise from an optical cavity , or a defect mode in a photonic band gap material @xcite .",
    "however we emphasise that the @xmath0 ` spins ' may correspond to _ any _ two - level system , including superconducting qubits and atoms @xcite .",
    "the bosonic field is then any field to which the corresponding spins couple @xcite .",
    "apart from the experimental prediction of novel phase transitions , our work also provides an interesting generalisation of the well - known dicke model .",
    "the method of solution that we present here is in fact valid for a wider class of hamiltonians incorporating spin  spin and spin  boson interactions @xcite .",
    "we follow the method of wang and hioe @xcite , whose results also proved to be valid for a wider class of dicke hamiltonians .",
    "we focus on the simple example of the dicke hamiltonian with an additional spin ",
    "spin interaction in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "@xmath5 following the discussion above , the experimental spin  spin interactions are likely to be short - ranged and hence only nearest - neighbor interactions are included in @xmath6 .",
    "the operators in eqs . 1 and 2 have their usual , standard meanings .",
    "to obtain the thermodynamical properties of the system , we first introduce the glauber coherent states @xmath7 of the field @xcite where @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the coherent states are complete , @xmath10 . in this basis",
    ", we may write the canonical partition function as : @xmath11 as in ref . @xcite , we adopt the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 exist as @xmath14 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath15 can be interchanged",
    "we then find @xmath16 where @xmath17 we first rotate about the @xmath4-axis to give @xmath18 we note here that the resulting hamiltonian is of the type of an ising hamiltonian with a transverse field , and it exhibits a divergence in concurrence at its quantum phase transition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this particular model is instrumental in understanding the nature of coherence in quantum systems .",
    "going back to the calculations , we may now diagonalise @xmath19 by performing a jordan - wigner transformation , passing into momentum - space and then performing a bogoliubov transformation ( see , for example , ref .",
    "we then have , in terms of momentum - space fermion operators @xmath20 , the diagonalised @xmath19 : @xmath21 with @xmath22 we may then write @xmath23 where @xmath24 from the transformation , we may associate the spin - up state with an empty orbit on the site and a spin - down state with an occupied orbital . using the commutation relations for the @xmath20 and the fact that @xmath25 ( see , for example , ref .",

    "hence the process is a continuous phase transition .",
    "however the case of non - zero @xmath46 is qualitatively different from @xmath44 . as a result of the frustration induced by the tranverse nearest - neighbour couplings , _",
    "there are regions where the super - radiant phase transition becomes first - order .",
    "_ hence _ the system s phase transition can be driven to become first - order by suitable adjustment of the nearest - neighbour couplings_. this phenomenon of first - order phase transitions is revealed by considering the functional shape of @xmath42 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pt ] .",
    "figure [ x - lambda ] shows the value of @xmath43 that maximises @xmath42 at fixed @xmath47 and two different values of @xmath46 . from the two lines , we can see that the spin ",
    "spin coupling actually acts to inhibit the phase transition .",
    "as we increase @xmath46 from @xmath48 to @xmath49 we can see that the value to which we have to increase @xmath50 to induce a phase transition is higher .",
    "figure [ maximiser ] plots the maximiser of @xmath42 with @xmath50 fixed at a value of 1.3 . for small @xmath46 ,",
    "the local ( non - zero ) maximum of @xmath42 converges to zero as we increase @xmath47 and the system is no longer super - radiant .",
    "this is no longer the case if @xmath46 is increased . in this case",
    ", @xmath42 has a global maximum when @xmath47 is small ; however as @xmath47 increases , the non - zero local maxima becomes dominant and as a result a first - order phase transition occurs .",
    "we note that the barriers between the wells are infinite in the thermodynamic limit , hence we expect that the sub - radiant state is metastable as @xmath47 increases .",
    "this observation also suggests the phenomenon of hysteresis , which awaits experimental validation .    in fig .",
    "[ op ] we consider the order parameter of the transition , @xmath51 .",
    "following the same method as above , we may calculate this to be equivalent to @xmath52 with an additional @xmath53 term that comes from the imaginary part of the coherent states of the radiation field @xcite .",
    "we can see from the figure that as we lower @xmath54 we drive the system first through a first order phase transition and then through a continuous phase transition .",
    "thus we are able to achieve both a first and second order phase transition by varying the one parameter , @xmath54 .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the experimentally relevant spin - spin interaction in the dicke model transforms it into an ising - hamiltonian with a photon - field dependent transverse field , which allows for an existence of both first - order and second - order phase transitions as parameters vary .",
    "our results highlight the importance of spin - spin coupling terms in spin - boson systems and opens up the possibility of coherently controlling the competition between the sub - radiant and super - radiant states in experimental atom - radiation systems @xcite .",
