    "the observation of strong gravitational lensing events has allowed many studies about the mass , density profile and structure of the galaxies that act as lenses , which could also have important implications for dark matter and cosmology studies  see kochanek s contribution in @xcite for a review in the field . among strong lensing works , and of particular interest here , there are those of joint studies with stellar dynamics , which allow a determination of the density profile for individual lenses @xcite and for sets of lenses @xcite .",
    "it is of fundamental interest to this line of research to control for possible systematic effects , such as the influence of the large - scale structure ( lss ) along the line - of - sight ( l.o.s . ) and the role of other properties of the lens - galaxy .",
    "several works have considered l.o.s . effects on strong lensing studies .",
    "@xcite investigated theoretically the effect of the large - scale structure on strong lensing events , finding that it can be significant , for example leading to incorrect conclusions about the distribution of matter in the lens .",
    "@xcite observed that external shear due to galaxies and clusters associated with the primary lens or along the l.o.s . can be an important perturbation in individual lens models .",
    "@xcite used ray - tracing to investigate the effect of density inhomogeneities along the l.o.s .",
    "of strong lenses and concluded that the effect of environment is negligible in general , but might be important in rare cases .",
    "@xcite noted that secondary matter along the l.o.s .",
    "of strong lenses is strongly dependent on source redshift , being rare for sources with @xmath0 , but that can lead in some circumstances to an overestimate of 10 - 15% of the primary lens mass if ignored .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic observations @xcite discovered a significant l.o.s .",
    "effect on some individual strong lens galaxies .",
    "@xcite observed that even in under - dense local environments , the l.o.s .",
    "contamination may give a considerable contribution to galaxy - scale strong lenses .",
    "using ray - tracing thought the millennium simulation , @xcite determined that strong lensing lines - of - sight are biased towards higher than average mean densities , contributing a few percent to the total surface density , and @xcite found that secondary matter along the l.o.s .",
    "has a large effect on the strong - lensing optical depth and the cross - section for cluster strong lensing .",
    "@xcite did not find an over - density of photometric sources along the l.o.s . of a limited sample of slacs strong lenses in comparison with other sdss massive early - type galaxies and",
    "interpreted that as evidence against a possible l.o.s .",
    "@xcite measured the over - density of galaxies around slacs lenses and observed that typical contributions from external mass distributions are of order of few percent , but reaching 10 - 20% in some cases .",
    "@xcite considered strong and weak lensing observations in the cosmos survey and compared with simulations , finding that strong lensed images with large angular separation were in the densest regions .    in this paper",
    "we use two independent galaxy mass estimate methods , strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics , to examine the influence the lss in the l.o.s . of the lenses and its effect on the determination of the lens density profile .",
    "we use all the suitable events in the slacs sample , considering realistic brightness functions for the lens - galaxies , and incorporating our prior ignorance on their stellar velocity anisotropy .    in section [ methods_data ]",
    "we describe how we calculate the mass of slacs lenses using strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics , and our bayesian statistical approach . in section [ results ]",
    "we show our results , and in section [ conclusion ] we present our discussion and conclusions .",
    "the analysis in this paper is based on the comparison of galaxy masses calculated through two different methods : gravitational lensing and dynamical analysis . in section 2.1",
    "we present the data used in the analysis , collected from the slacs survey .    in sections 2.2 and 2.3",
    ", we discuss the lensing and dynamical mass determinations , respectively .",
    "we will assume simple models for the galaxy mass distribution ( e.g. , spherical symmetry , power - law density distribution ) because they have few free parameters and allow to illustrate well the two methods .",
    "for a similar approach see @xcite .",
    "we want to examine whether the two mass estimates are indeed equivalent and/or if there is evidence of systematic differences between them .",
    "section 2.4 presents a bayesian framework to analyze this problem .",
    "the selected set of galaxies is part of the sloan lens acs survey , slacs @xcite , which is a hubble space telescope ( hst ) snapshot imaging survey for strong gravitational galactic lenses .",
    "the candidates for the hst imaging were selected spectroscopically from the sdss database and are a sub - sample of the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample .",
    "we use data compiled from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , constructing a sample of 58 strong gravitational lensing events where the lenses are isolated early - type galaxies ( e+s0 ) .",
    "data from slacs is especially suitable for joint strong lensing and dynamical analysis because they allow precise determination ( @xmath1 error ) of the einstein radius for each lens - galaxy in a relatively homogeneous sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "and , at the same time , sdss has precise stellar velocity dispersion measurements ( @xmath2 average error ) for the lenses , as well as redshifts for lenses and background sources .",
    "for each lens system we are interested in the redshift of the background lensed source @xmath3 , the redshift of the lens @xmath4 , the average stellar velocity dispersion inside an aperture @xmath5 , the effective angular radius @xmath6 and the einstein angular radius @xmath7 .",
    "the sample average values for these quantities are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the source and lens redshifts were determined from the sdss spectra , and the stellar velocity dispersion corresponds to the light - weighted average inside the @xmath13 diameter sdss fiber .",
    "the estimated projected mass inside the einstein radius @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17}$ ] is the angular - diameter distance of the lens , source , and between lens and source , respectively .",
    "these distances are calculated assuming a redshift - distance relation derived inside a chosen cosmological model that in the present paper is a concordance @xmath18cdm model with @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the einstein radii were determined from hst images using strong lensing modeling of the lenses and reconstruction of the unlensed sources @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath7 were reported to be around 5% , so we use this value for all einstein radii when calculating the error on @xmath21 .",
    "note that the lensing modeling uses a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) mass model , but the resulting projected mass distribution is parametrized by an einstein radius so that the enclosed mass in the projected ellipse is the same that would be enclosed in a projected circle from an equivalent singular isothermal sphere .",
    "this is the radius we adopt here .",
    "indeed , the einstein radius determined this way is a robust attribute of the lens , being little sensitive to the lens model used [ see kochanek s contribution in @xcite ] .",
    "however the einstein mass captures not only the lensing effect of the lens - galaxy , but also the lensing effect of all l.o.s . over and under - densities .",
    "we model this lss contribution by subtracting an effective external lensing convergence given by cosmology , @xmath22 .",
    "the real lensing mass of the lens - galaxy is therefore given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 note that the external convergence field can assume positive and negative values , therefore it can both decrease or increase the lensing mass .",
    "in general we do not know the value of @xmath22 for a given lens , so it has to be treated as a random value drawn from a probability distribution .",
    "that will be further discussed in section [ bayes ] .",
    "we call the dynamical mass , @xmath24 , the mass estimated from the observed velocity dispersion . here",
    "we are interested in examining the case of a power law for the density profile , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a constant that has to be determined from the jeans equation and the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "the mass within the cylinder @xmath27 of einstein radius @xmath28 is then @xmath29 the spherical jeans equation @xcite can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath32 is the luminosity density profile @xcite , @xmath33 is the anisotropy parameter of the velocity distribution ( @xmath34 is the tangential velocity dispersion ) , and @xmath35 is the gravitational potential produced by the assumed density profile .",
    "since the quantity observationally available is the luminosity - weighted average velocity dispersion within a given aperture , @xmath36 , the following constraint is necessary for the determination of the constant @xmath26 : @xmath37 where the integration volume is an infinite cylinder of radius @xmath38 with axis along the l.o.s .    to simplify , and",
    "since there is very little prior knowledge on the velocity anisotropy parameter , we assume that @xmath39 is a constant . in appendix",
    "[ app_jeans ] we give more details on the solution of the jean s equation ( [ jeans ] ) , and in appendix [ app_seeing ] we examine the correction due to seeing effects .",
    "figure [ dynamic_mass_fig ] displays the general behavior of the dynamical mass as a function of the density profile slope and velocity anisotropy parameter .",
    "we examine @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "other combinations around these fixed values give qualitatively similar results .",
    "the doted line depicts the strong lensing mass for this hypothetical system , so it is possible to glimpse from the intersection of the curves the expected value of the dynamical parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath39 .",
    "the use of the jaffe or the hernquist light profiles do not change the qualitative behavior of the curves .",
    "the use of a constant mass to light ratio , @xmath43 , displayed as the dot - dashed line on the left panel of figure [ dynamic_mass_fig ] , gives a very distinct and interesting behavior for @xmath44 , reproducing a result obtained by @xcite .",
    "however , a single power law is not a realistic approximation for the light distribution of the lens - galaxies in the sample .",
    "we want to compare the estimates of lensing and dynamical masses taking into account the possibility that masses obtained through gravitational lensing are affected by the lss , @xmath45 , and that the lens - galaxy dynamical mass depends only on its density profile and velocity anisotropy , @xmath46 .",
    "our models , then , can have up to three free parameters : @xmath22 , @xmath42 and @xmath39 .    to construct a likelihood for the system",
    "we define the quantity @xmath47 note that both @xmath48 and @xmath24 refer to the projected mass withing the einstein radius .",
    "the likelihood for each lens system is then written as @xmath49 , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the measured @xmath51 given the model and the observational data , and @xmath52 is the expected value for it , which , in the desired case where both @xmath48 and @xmath24 are estimates of the same true galaxy mass , corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "note that other quantities could be defined to construct the likelihood , for example @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the next to last definition gives a likelihood that is not symmetrical between @xmath48 and @xmath24 , what is not desirable , and the last example has the inconvenience of maximizing the likelihood not only in the desired region of the parameter space in which @xmath59 , but also in the region where both mass estimates are small , what introduces artificial solutions that give maximum l.o.s .",
    "however if @xmath60 is fixed , then all definitions for @xmath51 , including the last , give very similar results .",
    "the variance in @xmath51 is estimated as being ( an index @xmath61 is implied in all quantities ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the uncertainty in @xmath64 .",
    "the joint likelihood for the whole set of @xmath65 galaxies is then @xmath66 figure [ li_fig ] shows the individual @xmath42 likelihood distributions for each lens , as well as the joint likelihood for the whole sample , imposing fixed null external convergence and velocity anisotropy , recreating a similar figure obtained by @xcite . in the same figure we examine the impact of the seeing correction ( see appendix [ app_seeing ] ) .",
    "the two narrow and almost indistinguishable curves differ just in that in their calculation one takes into account the seeing correction ( dashed line ) and the other ( solid line ) does not .",
    "the seeing correction is negligible .",
    "the posterior probability distribution of the model parameters given the data is determined by the bayes theorem @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the bayesian evidence @xcite and @xmath69 is the product of the prior probability distributions for the model parameters .",
    "we adopt uniform priors for two of the parameters , @xmath70 for @xmath71 $ ] and for @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 outside these intervals .",
    "for @xmath22 we assume a prior given by the distribution of expected values for the convergence on a random l.o.s .",
    "in the concordance cosmology adopted here .",
    "we approximate this external convergence probability distribution function by the lognormal expression given by @xcite , @xmath74 , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we estimate the free parameters @xmath77 of the models using the bayes estimator ( also called the posterior mean ) @xmath78 and also calculate the root mean square deviation , rms@xmath79 , which give a measure of the parameter value dispersion .",
    "note that the parameter estimate is made from the whole data set considered altogether and not for each individual galaxy - lens system .",
    "the models are meant to be underlying models for all systems , independently of the particularities of each lens . in this approach",
    "the information about the sample dispersion among all lenses is mixed with the information about individual uncertainty in each lens .",
    "two models , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , even with different degrees of freedom , can be compared by the ratio of their bayesian evidence , also known as bayes factor , @xmath82 which values can be interpreted qualitatively using jeffrey s scale @xcite . the strength of the evidence in favor of the model with larger @xmath83 is called inconclusive if @xmath84 , weak if above this value and bellow @xmath85 , moderate if @xmath86 , and strong if above that .",
    "the main appeal of this approach for model comparison is that the bayesian evidence automatically implements occam s razor by penalizing more strongly more complex models , those with more free parameters .",
    "we sample the parameter space using a grid finer than the typical features scales of the system , which are characterized by the rms of each parameter .",
    "for example , for models with three free parameters we use as grid spacing : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ; for a model with only @xmath42 free we use",
    "@xmath90 , such grids allow a complete sampling of the relevant parameter space and guarantees an appropriate probing of the likelihood and reliable estimates of parameter values and bayesian evidence .",
    "we have analyzed the data described in section [ data ] with models with up to three degrees of freedom , one ( @xmath22 ) , corresponding to the l.o.s .",
    "lss contamination , that would affect the strong lensing estimate of the lens mass and two ( @xmath42 and @xmath39 ) , corresponding to intrinsic properties of the lens , that determine its dynamical mass estimate .",
    "two light distribution profiles ( jaffe and hernquist ) were examined .",

    "has a much higher bayesian evidence and yields a determination of this parameter with a 1% precision , being slightly steeper than a isothermal profile .",
    "this result is similar to what was found by @xcite .",
    "if instead of estimating @xmath93 and @xmath94 from ( [ post_mean ] ) we find for each lens - galaxy a @xmath98 ( the point of maximum likelihood for each @xmath99 ) and then proceed the calculation of the average value and sample deviation , we find @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "that is in broad agreement with is found from the posterior probability for the whole data set ( [ posterior ] ) ( remember that there is a factor @xmath102 between the sample and standard deviations before comparing with the value at table [ models_results ] ) .",
    "the addition of a degree of freedom due to a external convergence , constrained by a prior probability , generating a model with two degrees of freedom , does not alter the mean density profile slope , but increases in almost 40% the uncertainty in its determination .    a model with no external convergence and freedom in the density profile and anisotropy parameter allows a profile closer to isothermal , and in fact compatible with it , given its much larger dispersion on @xmath42 ( six times larger than for a model with only @xmath42 free ) .",
    "such model is compatible with isotropy , but is weakly disfavored in relation to a model with free density profile and fixed null anisotropy .",

    "a similar model , but with a different luminosity density profile ( hernquist ) , has a slightly steeper density profile and more negative anisotropy parameter , being weakly disfavored in comparison to the model with jaffe s light profile .",
    "if both external convergence and anisotropy are fixed , @xmath103 , then @xmath104 for both light profiles and @xmath105 ( using jaffe ) and @xmath106 ( using hernquist ) . therefore , the neglect of our ignorance on @xmath39 and , to a lower extent , @xmath22 , by fixing them equal to zero , implies a considerable underestimate of the dispersion in @xmath42 and possibly the introduction of a systematical error , since in the more complex model @xmath107 ( using jaffe ) , and @xmath108 ( using hernquist ) .",
    "the results for the posterior mean and rms for the external convergence suggest that the system likelihood did not alter the prior probability distribution for @xmath22 , which had @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the small difference may be attributed to the computational truncation of the calculations at @xmath111 , excluding rare events of larger value .",

    "the top row panels have models with two free parameters and one fixed , and the bottom panels have the models with three free parameters , but one of them marginalized over .",
    "when we compare the top and bottom panels at the first column it shows that the prior ignorance on the anisotropy parameter implies a more uncertain determination of the density profile .",
    "the second column shows that the reciprocal is also true , and the third column clearly depicts this degeneracy between density profile and anisotropy parameter , which was already hinted in figure [ dynamic_mass_fig ] , since the curves for @xmath112 and @xmath41 have monotonically increasing and decreasing behavior , respectively .",
    "the effect of taking into account a prior ignorance on @xmath22 is to fatter the banana shaped contour of the @xmath113 posterior probability plot , but not changing the projected limits on @xmath42 and @xmath39 .    in figure [ fig_likelihoods1d ] are shown the parameter posterior probability distributions marginalized over two parameters for models with three degrees of freedom .",
    "results for both light profiles ( jaffe and hernquist ) are presented , being qualitatively the same .",
    "the posterior distribution for the external convergence along the lenses line - of - sights ( left panel ) is indistinguishable from the prior distribution used , what indicates that the likelihood distribution in @xmath22 is much broader than the prior used .",
    "the marginalized posterior probability distributions for the density profile logarithmic slope ( central panel of figure [ fig_likelihoods1d ] ) follow a near gaussian behavior and illustrates what was already observed in table [ models_results ] .",

    "the right panel of figure [ fig_likelihoods1d ] shows the marginalized posterior probability distributions for the anisotropy parameter .",
    "it shows that our prior ignorance on the velocity anisotropy , quantified as a flat prior in the interval @xmath114 $ ] , is somewhat reduced , that the lenses are on average compatible with isotropy , but that positive and negative anisotropies are allowed , and that the use of jaffe s light profile favors slightly more positive values for @xmath39 than hernquist s .",
    "two independent methods , strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics , were used to determine the projected galaxy mass within its einstein radius for a set of 58 galaxies from slacs . from the comparison of the two masses , the lens density profile , velocity anisotropy and l.o.s .",

    "probed by the lenses since the posterior probability did not differ from the prior .",
    "the shapes of the @xmath115 and @xmath116 degeneracies indicate that the determination of the density profile and anisotropy parameter are not very sensitive to the value of the l.o.s .",
    "convergence in the range allowed by the prior probability distribution used . this can be understood from the functional dependence of the dynamical mass with @xmath42 and @xmath39 ( figure [ dynamic_mass_fig ] ) .",
    "a small variation in @xmath42 or @xmath39 implies a large change in @xmath24 .",
    "this may mean that the uncertainties in the system due to the lens structure are more determinant than the role played by the external convergence and/or that slacs lenses are in fact an unbiased sample in relation to a random l.o.s .",
    "that would be in agreement with @xcite who find large external convergence values in just few extreme cases and with @xcite , for whom secondary matter along the l.o.s .",
    "of strong lenses is strongly dependent on source redshift , being rare for sources with @xmath0 , what is the case for most slacs lenses . another argument for why slacs would not be biased to be in lines - of - sight with higher than average densities , as would be suggested by some theoretical works @xcite , is that they were spectroscopically selected .",
    "in contrast , lenses selected by photometric image identification would be more prone to be biased towards higher than average overdense l.o.s . because lensed images of larger separation angle , tracing the densest regions @xcite , would be more easily identified , what does not happen in a spectroscopically selected sample .",
    "the joint strong lensing and stellar dynamics analysis does improve our prior knowledge on the anisotropy parameter , but does not strongly constrain it , its probability distribution being broad and statistically compatible with isotropy on average .",
    "nevertheless , the degeneracy between @xmath42 and @xmath39 gives an indeterminacy that correlates a larger anisotropy with a flatter density profile , which can also be understood from the functional behavior of @xmath117 ( figure [ dynamic_mass_fig ] ) .",
    "an increment in @xmath42 can be annulled , in terms of a variation in the dynamical mass , by a decrement in @xmath39 , and vice - versa .    the inclusion of two degrees of freedom in the model with respect to the lss convergence and velocity anisotropy allows us to take into account and examine the effect of our prior ignorance on these features of the lens system .",
    "the most visible effect of @xmath22 and @xmath39 on the determination of the density profile logarithmic slope is the considerable broadening of its probability distribution , what means a more uncertain determination of @xmath42 than what is suggested by a simpler model that does not take into account those features . within the uncertainty found in the more complex model",
    ", the density profile is statistically compatible with an isothermal profile .",
    "this very particular density profile is also found by other authors , apparently as a result of the complementarity of baryonic and dark matter profiles @xcite .",
    "we used standard assumptions and approximations in our modeling of galaxies and analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we can identify several areas where further work can be done to refine the understanding of these strong lensing systems , which can also be seem as caveats to the present works in the area . among them",
    "we highlight ( i ) the triaxiality and substructure of lens halos , whose importance was already suggested by @xcite and @xcite in the context of simulations on cluster scales ; ( ii ) the correction of the dynamical mass estimate due to rotational support .",
    "it is well known that some early - type galaxies can have a significant rotational component ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and two - dimensional kinematics for some few slacs lenses are already becoming available @xcite ; ( iii ) the brightness distribution , which could be treated more realistically with the observed full surface luminosities for the individual lenses , instead of individualized fits of an universal profile ; and ( iv ) the velocity anisotropy parameter , which was assumed to be a constant , but that more realistically must be a function of radius .",
    "however very little is known about the velocity anisotropy of early - type galaxies , be it observationally , theoretically and even from simulations .    the relaxation of some of our assumptions , with the almost inevitable addition of extra free parameters , could prove a fruitful source of investigation , however would likely require a larger galaxy sample to reduce the likely increased degeneracies among the degrees of freedom of the model .",
    "as we have illustrated , models with a large number of parameters may have a higher likelihood but lower bayesian evidence , since the added complexity must pay its price in a bayesian sense .",

    "<S> data from 58 strong lensing events surveyed by the sloan lens acs survey is used to estimate the projected galaxy mass inside their einstein radii by two independent methods : stellar dynamics and strong gravitational lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a joint analysis of these two estimates inside models with up to three degrees of freedom with respect to the lens density profile , stellar velocity anisotropy and line - of - sigh external convergence , which incorporates the effect of the large - scale structure on strong lensing . </S>",
    "<S> a bayesian analysis is employed to estimate the model parameters , evaluate their significance and compare models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the data favor jaffe s light profile over hernquist s , but that any particular choice between these two does not change the qualitative conclusions with respect to the features of the system that we investigate . </S>",
    "<S> the density profile is compatible with an isothermal , being sightly steeper and having an uncertainty in the logarithmic slope of the order of 5% in models that take into account a prior ignorance on anisotropy and external convergence . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a considerable degeneracy between the density profile slope and the anisotropy parameter , which largely increases the uncertainties in the estimates of these parameters , but we encounter no evidence in favor of an anisotropic velocity distribution on average for the whole sample . </S>",
    "<S> a line - of - sight external convergence following a prior probability distribution given by cosmology has a small effect on the estimation of the lens density profile , but can increase the dispersion of its value by nearly 40% . </S>"
