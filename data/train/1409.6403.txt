    "in recent years , rogue waves have been intensively aroused much attention in many fields from optics to bose - einstein condensates @xcite-@xcite .",
    "mathematically , the rational solution ( so called peregrine solution ) of focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) is initially used to explain such rogue wave phenomenon in these contexts .",
    "this mainly stems from it localized in both coordinates and reaches a height which is three times of background amplitude . starting with the pioneer work made by akhmediev research group @xcite , various technique have been taken to derive the _ _ n__th - order rational solutions of nlse @xcite-@xcite .",
    "indeed , the construction of rational solutions requires some special methods that differ from those utilized to get multisoliton solutions @xcite .",
    "currently , the darboux transformation method and the bilinear method are regarded as two effective methods since they are used to create the whole hierarchy of rational solutions for a wide class of nonlinear evolution equations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "hirota equation is a modified nlse especially when the third order dispersion and time - delay changes are taken into account . with regard to rogue wave solutions of hirota equation",
    ", they have been announced using darboux transformation method @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recalling that the results obtained by bilinear method is more explicit than darboux transformation in the framework of nlse @xcite , a question arises whether the rogue wave solutions of hirota equation can be achieved with the help of bilinear method like nlse . here",
    ", we give a positive answer .",
    "we consider the hirota equation in the following form @xmath1 since rogue waves are always assumed to approach a same constant background when @xmath2 , let us consider the variable transformation @xmath3 then the hirota equation ( [ 1 ] ) becomes @xmath4 using the independent variable transformation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a real function and @xmath7 is a complex one with respect to variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "then eq.([3 ] ) is transformed into the following bilinear form @xmath10 where the @xmath11 is hirota s bilinear differential operator ( see @xcite ) . hereafter , ` - ' represents complex conjugation .",
    "just like nlse @xcite , by applying bilinear equations ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , @xmath0th - order rational solution of hirota equation ( [ 1 ] ) can be constructed by the following theorems .",
    "the hirota equation ( [ 1 ] ) has rational solutions @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the matrix elements are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 here , @xmath16 are the arbitrary complex constants and @xmath17 are positive integers .    similar to the analysis of nlse @xcite , we may also set @xmath18 without loss of generality and remain the irreducible complex parameters @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , these rational solutions could also be expressed in a more explicit form in terms of schur polynomial .",
    "in this section , we give some examples to illustrate the dynamics of rouge waves in the hirota equation by applying the above theorem .",
    "firstly , setting @xmath20 in theorem will produce the following first order rogue wave solution @xmath21 where @xmath22 the above algebra structure is extremely similar to the formula in nlse .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 , direct substitution shows that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are solutions of bilinear equations ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) . after setting @xmath25 ,",
    "then we could obtain the first order rogue wave solution @xmath26 where @xmath27 . in ( [ 9 ] ) , take @xmath28 and let @xmath29 , then this solution is reduced to the first order rogue wave solution of nlse @xcite .    in order to get second order rogue wave solution of equation ( [ 3 ] ) , we take @xmath30 in theorem . according to the previous analysis",
    ", we may set @xmath31 in ( [ 7 ] ) , this case leads to @xmath32 where @xmath33 + 144|a_3|^2,\\\\ & & g=24({x}^{3}(4it+1)(4 - 2x)+ 3(1 - 4\\,it)x+16t^2(4\\,i{t}+3)x(1-x)-6{x}^{2}\\\\ & & \\qquad+12\\,it-32\\,i{t}^{3}-128\\,i{t}^{5}-48 \\,{t}^{2}-160\\,{t}^{4}+\\lambda_2\\\\ & & \\qquad+6a_3(36\\,{t}^{2}{v}^{2}+ 12t(1 + 2\\,i{t}-x ) v-4\\,{t } ^{2}-4\\,ixt+4\\,it+1 - 2\\,x+{x}^{2 } ) \\\\&&\\qquad+6\\overline{a}_3[-36\\,{t}^{2}{v}^{2}+ 12t(2\\,i{t}+x ) v-4\\,ixt-{x}^ { 2}+4\\,{t}^{2}]),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath34{v}^{4 } \\\\ & & \\qquad -1728{t}^{3 } \\left ( 3 - 48\\,{t}^{2}+40\\,{x}^{3}+96\\,{t}^{2}x+12\\,x-60\\,{x}^{2 } \\right ) { v}^{3}\\\\ & & \\qquad + 288{t}^{2 } \\left[17 - 3\\,x+144\\,{x}{t}^{2}(x-1)+ 96\\,{t}^{2}({t}^{2}+1)+30\\,{x}^{2}(x-1)^2 \\right ] { v}^{2}\\\\ & & \\qquad -24 t [ 192\\,{t}^{2}({x}^{3}-t^2+x+2t^2x-\\frac{3}{2}x^2-\\frac{1}{8})+56\\,{x}^{3}-30\\,{x}^{2}\\\\ & & \\qquad-60\\,{x}^{4}+24\\,{x}^{5}+ 36\\,x-9 ] v,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath35v^2 + 6[4t(1 + 4\\,i{t}){x}^{2}(2x-3)\\\\ & & \\qquad + 4 t ( 32\\,i{t}^{3}+24\\,{t}^{2}+8\\,i{t}+5   ) x-64\\,i{t}^{4}-48\\,{t}^{3}-4\\,i{t}^{2}-7\\,t ] v,\\\\ & & \\alpha_1=-108(2\\,x -1 ) { t}^{2},\\quad \\alpha_2=12\\,t ( 3\\,{x}^{2}-3\\,x-12\\,{t}^{2}-2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] direct substitution shows that @xmath36 is indeed the solution of hirota equation ( [ 1 ] ) using the symbolic software @xmath37 .",
    "if we take @xmath28 and make the transformation @xmath38 , the above solution will be reduced to the second order rogue wave solution of nlse presented by ohta and yang @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is found that the maximum of @xmath39 is not affected by the values of @xmath40 and achieved @xmath41 when @xmath42 .",
    "this means the value of @xmath40 only contributes to the skewness of rogue waves . in the following , to show the effectiveness of our method",
    ", we mainly study the third order case graphically .",
    "figure 1 ( a ) and ( c ) display two kinds of asymmetrical third order rogue waves while figure 1 ( b ) gives a symmetrical one . in the symmetrical case , the maximum of @xmath43 reach 7 . in the two asymmetrical cases , from the central line @xmath43 ( see figure 1d ) , we observe that all the zeros of @xmath43 occur on the real @xmath8 axis but the maximum of @xmath43 is lower than 7 .",
    "it indicates that the spatial - temporal symmetry may be a criterion to identify the generation of higher order rogue waves .",
    "in addition , by some different choices of the free parameter @xmath44 , we plot four kinds of typical triangular rogue wave cascades patterns in figure 2 .",
    "it is evident that the spatial - temporal distribution of the rouge wave rotates an angle @xmath45 around its central position when we change the sign of the value of @xmath44 .",
    "to sum up , it has been shown that general @xmath0th - order rogue wave solution of hirota equation can be produced with the help of bilinear method .",
    "these solutions are expressed in terms of determinants and possess similar structures like nlse in @xcite .",
    "the truth of these results can be testified by symbolic software _ maple _ using the bilinear equations ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "taking third order rogue wave solutions as a example and adjusting the values of the free irreducible parameters , we mainly investigate some higher order rogue wave patterns and triangular rogue wave cascades patterns .",
    "these results demonstrate that bilinear method is a powerful method to construct rogue waves of nonlinear evolution equations and we expect the rogue wave solutions of derivative nlse may also be established by means of bilinear method .",
