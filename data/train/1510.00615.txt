    "there are now known to be at least three cases where large asteroidal bodies , tens to hundreds of kilometers in diameter , have been catastrophically disrupted as the result of a large - scale impact within the last ten million years ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2003 ; 2008 ; dermott et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the most dramatic evidence for the occurrence of such catastrophic collisions is the existence of asteroid families .",
    "these are groups of asteroids with very similar orbits that are produced by the disruption of a single , large parent body ( hirayama 1918 ) .",
    "however , the kilometer - sized daughter fragments that make up the family merely represent the large end of a size distribution of collisional debris that extends down to micron - sized dust particles .",
    "these dust particles can also be observed , in the form of the iras ( infrared astronomical satellite , which performed an all - sky survey at infrared wavelengths ) solar system dust bands ( low et al . , 1984 ) as a fine structure feature of the zodiacal cloud .",
    "+ the three prominent and well studied dust band pairs known to have been created in asteroidal disruptions within the last 10 my are associated with the veritas , karin , and beagle asteroid families ( nesvorn et al . 2003 ; 2008 ) .",
    "several additional dust bands have been postulated by sykes ( 1988 ) in the iras data and by reach et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the cobe ( cosmic background explorer ) data but the available observations lacked the sensitivity to characterize the structures .",
    "the discovery of several new , younger ( < 1 ma ) asteroid clusters ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2006b ) provides possible new sources for these postulated dust bands .",
    "clusters are similar to asteroid families , but result from groupings of only a few asteroids .",
    "potential asteroid clusters can be identified from searching for groupings of bodies in proper - element space , where proper elements are time - averaged orbital elements from which secular gravitational perturbations have been removed .",
    "milani and kneevi ( explained in milani et al .",
    "2014 ) have produced a large database of proper elements based on the ever - growing catalog of orbital elements from the minor planet center . using the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm ; zappala et al .",
    "1990 ) , nesvorn et al . were able to identify clusters with only a few , small members .",
    "these clusters are the result of recent disruptions ( section 3.3 ) of much smaller asteroids ( @xmath310 km in diameter ) than those producing the prominent dust bands , whose parent bodies range from @xmath130140 km .",
    "even though these clusters come from smaller parent bodies , they are so young that they have not yet lost as much of their original dust ( the dust produced in the disruption that created the family / cluster ) as have their older and larger dust band parent - body counterparts . while the timescale for dust band pair formation in the central asteroid belt from secular gravitational perturbations is @xmath110@xmath4 years ( e.g. sykes and greenberg 1986 ) , on shorter timescales , dust particles with diameters smaller than @xmath11 cm are removed by poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag , inter - particle collisions , and radiation pressure .",
    "thus , young , partial dust bands retain more of the dust and preserve the original size distribution of the population ejected into the cloud following an asteroid disruption .",
    "+ in order to search for these fainter dust bands , we utilized a method to coadd the iras data , providing us with an increased signal - to - noise view of the dust band structure of the zodiacal cloud at thermal wavelengths . in this method , which is discussed in detail in section [ sec : coadd ] , we coadd virtually all the pole - to - pole intensity scans of the iras data set using a procedure for correcting the variations due to both the observing geometry of the iras satellite and the structural variations of the cloud . the application of this coadding method to the data produced a significant increase in signal - to - noise and revealed and confirmed the existence of an additional solar system dust band at an ecliptic latitude of @xmath117@xmath0 .",
    "while this feature was glimpsed in earlier work by both sykes ( 1988 ) and reach et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the data at the time lacked the sensitivity to confirm it as a dust band pair and it was thought to possibly be a comet debris trail .",
    "the quality of this coadded data has allowed us to clearly examine the structure of the 17@xmath0 dust band around the sky , confirm it as a dust band pair , and explain its structure .",
    "the data revealed that the 17@xmath0 dust band is present at some , but not all , ecliptic longitudes .",
    "as will be explained in section [ sec : evidence ] , this suggests that the 17@xmath0 solar system dust band is a young , partial dust band which is still in the process of forming ( espy et al .",
    "+ in order to interpret the co - added data and better understand this new band , we created a detailed dynamical model of the band .",
    "previous models of dust band evolution ( e.g. vokrouhlick et al . 2008 ) have provided a detailed look at dust band evolution but have not had the advantage of observational constraints which allow us to now put limits on the amount and sizes of material producing the band .",
    "because the 17@xmath0 dust band is so young , it still retains important information on the original catastrophic disruption that produced it .",
    "this partial structure allows us to unambiguously link a dust band with its source body because this young structure retains additional information on the orbital node and time since disruption .",
    "partial dust bands also provide an observational constraint on the quantity and sizes of dust particles released in the catastrophic disruption of an asteroid  information that is lost with time and not seen in the older bands .",
    "the young structure at 17@xmath0 allows a much better estimate of the total dust produced in the disruption  allowing some constraints to be placed on the parent asteroid s structure .",
    "determining the cross - sectional area of dust originally released in a disruption allows us to estimate the magnitude of dust originally produced in the larger , older disruptions that dominate the asteroidal component and to evaluate consequences for the temporal evolution of the cloud .",
    "+ this paper focuses on the study of the 17@xmath0 band and the analysis of its dynamical structure .",
    "we begin by explaining the coadding process that revealed the new band ( section [ sec : coadd ] ) and then present an analysis of the structural variations of the band that reveal it as a young , still forming structure ( section [ sec : seventeen ] ) .",
    "we explain how the models of the forming band are created ( section [ sec : models ] ) and discuss the role of collisions in young bands ( section [ sec : collisions ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the models with the observations and the techniques used to constrain the data as well as a discussion of the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude with a full discussion of the importance of partial dust bands and a summary of the main results ( section [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "in order to search for fainter dust band pairs , we increased the signal - to - noise ratio of the observations through a process that involved coadding the iras zohf ( zodiacal history file ) scans .",
    "we corrected structural variations of the cloud itself and those variations resulting from the different observing geometries undertaken by the iras satellite ( jayaraman 1995 ) .",
    "we normalized and coadded the data in a way that did nt remove or reduce the faint dust band signal .",
    "there are two main variations that needed to be corrected for .",
    "the first is the variation of the magnitude of the separation of the band pair seen in observations taken at different solar elongation angles .",
    "this variation stems from a parallax effect due to observing the bands from different distances .",
    "the second variation is the shift in the center of symmetry of the dust band pair as seen in observations taken at different ecliptic longitudes .",
    "this variation results because the dust band midplane is inclined to the ecliptic .",
    "the details of these variations and their corrections are explained below .      in the iras observing strategy a lune is defined as a bin of @xmath130@xmath0 ecliptic longitude .",
    "each lune contains up to @xmath150 usable thermal emission profiles at solar elongation ( @xmath5 ) angles varying from about @xmath6 .",
    "as the spacecraft incremented the solar elongation angle of the observations ( the observing angle measured from the sun - earth line ) , the effective distances to the dust bands changed ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the reason for the difference is that most of the dust band signal is coming from near 2 au due to the dynamical dispersion of the dust band structure interior to this region ( e.g. kehoe et al . 2007 ) .",
    "observations taken at solar elongation angles greater than 90@xmath7 result in the spacecraft viewing dust band material that is closer than the dust band material observed by the spacecraft when the observations had a solar elongation angle less than 90@xmath7 ( as shown in figure  [ fig : schem2 ] ) . observing the dust bands at different distances results in a parallax effect : dust band pairs that are closer to the observer ( higher elongation angles ) will appear to show a greater latitudinal separation than dust that is farther away ( smaller elongation angles ) .",
    "figure [ fig : elongvar ] shows an example of the variation in the separation of the 10@xmath0 veritas dust band pair peaks for observations taken at solar elongation @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , in a single lune .",
    "+    , are shown .",
    "the earth ( including the observing spacecraft ) is shown at 1 au ( inner circle ) and the dust bands are represented as the outer circle at 2 au . as iras observed at different solar elongation angles , the effective distance to the dust band varied , creating a parallax effect .",
    "observations taken at @xmath10 are closer to the observer than those taken at @xmath11 .",
    "this results in the effective distance to the dust band varying with elongation angle and explains the variations seen in figure [ fig : elongvar].,width=384 ]    , the effective distance to the dust band varied , creating a parallax effect .",
    "observations taken at @xmath10 observe dust bands closer to the observer than those taken at @xmath11 .",
    "this results in a parallax effect of decreasing dust band pair latitudinal separation with increasing distance , as is shown here : a larger separation of the 10@xmath0 bands in the @xmath12 observations and a smaller separation in the @xmath13 observations .",
    "the variation of the separation of the peaks of the north and south 10@xmath7 bands vary linearly with elongation angle over the small ecliptic longitude range of the lune and this was used to normalize the data to a solar elongation angle @xmath14 , so it could be coadded .",
    "the coadded data for this range of ecliptic longitude is shown in the bottom profile . , width=384 ]    the 10@xmath7 veritas band pair components ( seen at an ecliptic latitude of about @xmath1510@xmath7 ) were used as markers of the data for the coadding process . for each observation , we did systematic fits to determine the precise latitude of the peak flux of the northern and southern components of the 10@xmath7 band . when the latitudes were plotted against the solar elongation angle , we found that the location of the latitude of the peak varied approximately linearly with the solar elongation angle of the observation over the ecliptic longitude range of a single lune . for each lune , we determined the slope and y - intercept of the linear variation then normalized the separation of the peaks in that lune to their @xmath14 values .",
    "an example of a normalized scan is shown at the bottom of figure [ fig : elongvar ] .      because the dust band midplane is inclined to the ecliptic ( e.g. dermott et al . 1999 )",
    ", the north and south components of the dust bands will be equally spaced above and below the ecliptic only at the nodes of these two planes ( figure [ fig : schem1 ] ) . for observations taken away from the nodes",
    ", the bands will have a center of symmetry that is shifted away from the ecliptic , either to northern or southern latitudes depending on the ecliptic longitude of the observation .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen if we look at observations taken at different ecliptic longitudes around the sky .",
    "figure [ fig : longvar ] shows examples for observations taken at a range of ecliptic longitudes ( all at @xmath14 , representing the approximate center of each lune ) ) in the direction of the earth s motion .",
    "the seasonal shift of the center of symmetry of the 10@xmath7 band pair due to its inclination to the ecliptic is clearly evident .",
    "the resulting variation of this shift is sinusoidal around the sky ( e.g. dermott et al . 1999 ) .",
    "because the inclination of the dust band midplane to the ecliptic is well understood , the magnitude of the shift of the band center with ecliptic longitude can be characterized and used to normalize the observations of each lune so that the dust band midplane is centered on an ecliptic latitude of 0@xmath7 .",
    "this removes the forced inclination of the dust band midplane with respect to the ecliptic ( mostly due to the presence of jupiter ) and projects the dust band midplane into the ecliptic plane .",
    "after we normalize the data in each lune to a solar elongation angle of 90@xmath7 , we then normalize these coadded lunes to the ecliptic plane ( an ecliptic latitude of 0@xmath7 ) .",
    "this allows virtually the entire iras zohf data set to be coadded ( with the exception of a few regions contaminated by the galactic center ) to yield a high signal - to - noise ratio in the data ( jayaraman 1995 ; grogan et al .",
    "1997 ) .    .",
    "because of this inclination , the center of symmetry of the northern and southern bands will vary for observations taken at different ecliptic longitudes .",
    "the northern band is shown in red , the southern band in blue and the intersection of the dust band plane of symmetry ( light grey ) with the ecliptic ( dark grey ) is marked at the nodes ( purple ) . for observations taken of the nodes of the two planes ,",
    "the northern and southern band will be equally spaced above and below the ecliptic plane ( as marked at the ascending node , @xmath16 ) .",
    "observations taken between the ascending and descending nodes , ( an example is shown in green ) will see a shift in the bands with the southern band being closer to the ecliptic than the northern band . for observations taken between the descending and ascending node ( an example is shown in blue ) the opposite will be true . this results in the variation of the band structure shown in figure [ fig : longvar].,width=480 ]    , the inclination of the dust band midplane with respect to the ecliptic caused an apparent shift of the center of symmetry of the dust band pairs in the different observations .",
    "the variation of the center of the symmetry of the 10@xmath0 dust band pairs is shown for observations taken at five different ecliptic longitudes , each at a solar elongation angle of 90@xmath7 .",
    "for observations taken at longitudes away from the nodes of the dust band midplane ( where it crosses the ecliptic plane ) , the midplane of the dust band pairs is not centered on 0@xmath7 ecliptic latitude.,width=384 ]",
    "we used the coadding procedure described in section [ sec : coadd ] to combine virtually the entire iras 25 @xmath2 m zohf data set into a single thermal emission profile . this profile",
    "( figure [ fig : alldata ] ) reveals the existence of a new dust band pair at an ecliptic latitude of approximately @xmath17 ( shown marked by vertical lines ) .",
    "based on the latitude of this new band pair , we believe it to be a confirmation of the m / n pair originally seen by sykes in the iras data ( 1988 ) and also by reach in the cobe data ( 1997 ) . + as an additional check that this band is , in fact , a real dynamic structure and not a relic of the fourier - filtering process ( which separates the fine structure dust bands from the broad background cloud ) , we did a test to determine the plane of symmetry of the new structure relative to the existing band pairs .",
    "we fitted gaussians to both the northern and southern veritas @xmath18 band components to determine their precise locations and used these to determine the plane of symmetry .",
    "we repeated the process for the northern and southern components of the @xmath19 band to determine if both band pairs have the same plane of symmetry , as would be expected if the new dust band is a real dynamical structure .",
    "the results of the gaussian fitting to the partial band and the @xmath18 band show that the partial band does , in fact , have a common plane of symmetry to the other dust band pair to within 0.01@xmath7 , which would be surprising if the band was simply a relic of the fourier - filtering process .",
    "a common plane of symmetry is expected for all band pairs because , in the asteroid belt where the dust band structure is located , the plane of symmetry is largely determined by the forced inclination imposed by jupiter ( e.g. dermott et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the inclination of the dust band midplane with respect to the ecliptic was found to be 1.16 @xmath15 0.09@xmath0 for the central and 10@xmath0 inclination band pairs by grogan et al .",

    "when the fourier - filtered iras zohf 25 @xmath2 m scans in both leading and trailing directions of the earth in its orbit and over all ecliptic longitudes are normalized and coadded the new dust band at ecliptic latitude of approximately @xmath20 can be seen ( as marked by the vertical lines).,width=384 ]      while coadding the entire iras data set serves to clearly reveal and confirm the existence of the @xmath19 band , we can also view the band in smaller coadded bins of @xmath1@xmath21 longitude around the sky ( called lunes ) to examine the longitudinal structure variations .",
    "examining the band in these individual coadded lunes shows how the magnitude of the band varies around the sky .",
    "these individual coadded lunes , shown in figures [ fig : llunes ] and [ fig : tlunes ] , are for observations taken in the leading and trailing directions of the earth s motion , respectively .",
    "the 17@xmath7 dust band is not present at all longitudes and the intensity of both the northern and southern components of the band varies .",
    "this behavior of the bands gave the first hint that the band at 17@xmath7 may be a young structure that is still forming and as such , its nodes are not fully differentially precessed around the sky . to understand this reasoning we consider the formation process of a dust band .",
    "+ when an asteroid breaks up , the orbits of the particles released in the disruption begin to disperse in semi - major axis , resulting in a differential precession of their nodes .",
    "this results in the dust orbits slowly forming a torus and a dust band pair . at the initial stage of this process , the particles ejected in the disruption will have slightly different velocities and thus slightly different semi - major axes .",
    "usually the velocities of the particles will be on the order of the escape velocity , which for a 10 km diameter asteroid is about 5 m s@xmath22 ( and for a 100 km asteroid is about 50 m s@xmath22 ) .",
    "these ejection velocities are small compared to the orbital velocity of 1520 km s@xmath22 , yet result in the particles spreading into a ring of material along the orbit of the parent asteroid on a timescale of hundreds to thousands of years . not only are the particles initially spread slightly in semi - major axis from the initial disruption but they are also spiraling inwards under the effect of p - r drag ( wyatt and whipple 1950 ) , which causes their semi - major axes to decay over time at a rate roughly inversely proportional to particle size .",
    "+ when the material has just spread around the orbit into a ring , very early in the evolution , no dust band is evident , just a ring of dust along the orbit of the source body .",
    "as the nodes begin to precess , the dust bands will start to appear as just a small amount of material at two different ecliptic longitudes 180@xmath7 apart in the sky , one at a northern latitude and one at a southern latitude .",
    "slowly , as the nodes precess and disperse around the ecliptic , the northern and southern band will spread in longitude and eventually create a full dust band pair when the nodes are completely differentially precessed . at the intermediate stages of formation",
    "there exists at some longitudes a dust band pair , at some only a northern band , and at some only a southern band . fully dispersed nodes and",

    "the leading and trailing observations each cover only a portion of the sky .",
    "thus in order to see the band variation around the whole sky we combine these observations by projecting the viewing directions onto the sky . in order to do this , we apply a transformation from the longitude of the earth when the observations were taken to the longitude of the the structure being observed .",

    "the assumption that most of the flux is coming from 2  au is not crucial to the result , because if the bands were located in the range of 1.8 au to 2.5 au , the longitudinal location of the structure relative to the observations would only shift by a few degrees in either direction .",

    "the possible sources are 1400 tirela at a proper inclination of 16.9@xmath7 , and the emilkowalski cluster at a proper inclination of 17.2@xmath7 . because of the intermediate nature of the structure of this new band ,",

    "as emilkowalski is the most likely candidate at present , we built a full dynamical model of the dust band that would be associated with the emilkowalski cluster and compared it to the coadded iras data .",

    "this new band however , allows us more information on the source , because we can model the precession of the nodes of the dust orbits to constrain both the age and the node of the source body .",
    "to produce a model that can be compared with the coadded observations , we track the dynamical evolution of the dust from the likely source body , emilkowalski .",
    "we use an semi - analytical rather than a purely numerical approach because it allows us to better understand the nature of the early stages of dust band formation and the main forces controlling its formation .",
    "we evolve the dust particle orbits under the effects of radiation pressure , poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag , solar wind drag , and perturbations from the 8 planets .        radiation pressure is the component of the radiation force that points radially away from the sun .",
    "it stems from a transfer of momentum due to the impact of solar photons with the dust particles .",
    "the strength of the force of radiation pressure varies inversely proportional to the square of the particles distance from the sun , just as gravity does .",

    ", we should expect it to detect a minimum of a few forming dust bands , each of which can modeled using the method developed here .",
    "+ modeling the amount of cross - sectional area of material in any future bands will allow us to refine our estimate of the total asteroidal component of the zodiacal cloud . additionally , modeling any future partial bands will help put constraints on the detailed temporal evolution of the zodiacal cloud , since these faint bands come from smaller asteroids which break up more frequently and their dust likely persists for shorter amounts of time .",
    "future work on this topic should investigate how the temporal variation of the zodiacal cloud would compare to extrasolar debris disk brightness variations , e.g. are these disks in a steady state , or do they flare up in brightness with disruptions within the systems ( e.g. telesco et al . 2005 ; rieke et al .",
    "2005 ) ? understanding the temporal variation and the causes of such variation of the zodiacal cloud is the first step to better understanding these extrasolar debris disk systems .",
