    "the conductance shows a number of steps with increasing length , which can be understood as follows : at first , the entire regular region contributes to the conductance with 4 modes . with increasing @xmath27 , fewer and fewer regular modes contribute to the conductance , because they decay due to tunneling",

    "finally , at very large lengths of the wire , even the innermost regular mode no longer contributes to the transport , so that the conductance decays to zero . in this limit and on this length scale , one - sided disorder of the quantum wire",

    "the coupling to the chaotic sea by dynamical tunneling can also be viewed as `` flooding '' of the regular island by chaotic states.@xcite this notion is illustrated by the poincar - husimi distributions for states injected from and ejected to the right ( see , discussed below ) .",

    "for the largest @xmath27 we have complete flooding , i.e. , no regular modes are left and the chaotic modes fully extend into the regular island .",
