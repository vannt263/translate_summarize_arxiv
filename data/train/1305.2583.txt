    "we use historically first and the simplest one : @xmath4 here subscript in @xmath5 refers to zero quark mass ( see eq .",
    "( [ tau_c_full ] ) ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that more sophisticated forms of scaling variable discussed in the literature are disfavored by inclusive dis data .",
    "geometrical scaling is connected to the existence of the energy scale @xmath6 ( so - called saturation scale ) which is a border between dense and dilute gluonic systems ( for review see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "since masses of light quarks are negligible , @xmath7 is the only intermediate energy scale and one can argue that scaling variable , as dimensionless quantity , should be a ratio @xmath8 . in charm production gs is expected to be violated due to large quark mass @xmath9 gev .",
    "one can , however , modify ( @xmath10 ) to take into account @xmath11 and obtain approximate scaling ( following ref .",

    "@xcite to data on @xmath13 ( we use combined data from zeus and h1 experiments @xcite ) . analysis is performed parallelly for @xmath5 and @xmath14 .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows : for @xmath5 ( [ tau_0 ] ) some residual scaling can be observed but its quality is low ; for @xmath14 ( [ tau_c_full ] ) scaling is clearly better but not as good as for inclusive dis .    in sect .",
    "[ theory ] we briefly present dipole description of dis for small @xmath0 . in sect .",
    "[ mordescr ] we describe the method of ratios and define the criteria for gs to hold . results for hera data are presented in sect .",

    "dipole representation provides a convenient description of dis at small @xmath0 . there",
    ", a virtual photon @xmath15 splits into quark - antiquark pair of the transverse size @xmath16 which then interacts with the proton .",

    "@xmath19 , describes photon dissociation into a dipole and can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "it is convenient to consider photon with given polarization ( transverse or longitudinal ) : @xmath20 . in the leading order : @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the bessel functions , sum @xmath24 runs over all quark flavors with charge @xmath25 and mass @xmath26 ;",
    "we have also introduced : @xmath27    dipole cross section @xmath28 in ( [ factformula ] ) characterizes the interaction of quark - antiquark dipole with the proton .",
    "golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw ) @xcite postulated that in @xmath28 dipole size @xmath16 is scaled by saturation scale @xmath7 : @xmath29 and @xmath30 parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 set dimension and absolute value of the saturation scale .",

    "then @xmath39 and the right hand side of ( [ sigmafull ] ) depends only on one dimensionless quantity : @xmath40 this is exactly definition of gs with the explicit form of saturation scale ( [ qsat ] ) .    in the case of charm production , when a dipole consists of charm quarks , mass can not be neglected any more .",
    "the cross section in this case , which we denote as @xmath41 , corresponds to one term from the sum in ( [ sigmafull ] ) .",
    "it is clear that now left hand side of ( [ sigmafull ] ) depends not only on @xmath5 but also on the ratio @xmath42 and gs is violated .",
    "however , since for large @xmath43 this ratio is small one can generalize scaling variable to obtain approximate scaling .",
    "indeed , for @xmath44 factor @xmath45 equals 1 and square bracket in the second term is equal @xmath46 ( see eq .",
    "( [ ksidef ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath47 integrand in ( [ sigmafull ] ) depends on @xmath48q^2/q^2_{\\text{s}}(x)$ ] what suggests the following scaling variable : @xmath49    in saturation model for low @xmath43 one should take into account quark mass . to this end",
    "we shall follow ref .",
    "@xcite and replace @xmath50 in the formula for saturation scale ( [ qsat ] ) .    finally , substituting ( [ qsat ] ) into ( [ tau_bez_bar ] ) and raplacing bjorken-@xmath0",
    "according to ( [ x_bar ] ) one obtains scaling variable for charm production : @xmath51 let us emphasize that in this case scaling is not exact since we fixed @xmath44 , whereas the cross section contains integration over @xmath52 .",
    "geometrical scaling hypothesis for charm production means that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a universal , dimensionless function of scaling variable .",

    "for @xmath57 we shall use most recent results from hera @xcite . measured values ( in ref .",
    "@xcite denoted as @xmath58 ) are not exactly @xmath57  contribution from longitudinally polarized photons is not included and production of charm in final state is not excluded .",
    "these corrections are at most of the order of a few percent @xcite _ i.e. _ smaller than @xmath57 errors and should not affect our findings .    let us define @xmath59 _ i.e. _ cross section as a function of @xmath43 with fixed @xmath0 .",
    "( [ scal_hyps ] ) means that functions @xmath60 for different @xmath0 follow one curve .",
    "in fact instead of fixing @xmath0 one can use any other kinematical variable @xmath61 and consider @xmath62 evaluated in terms of @xmath43 or @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that here the most convenient choice for @xmath61 is a photon - proton center of mass energy : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a proton mass .",
    "we define : @xmath65 _ i.e. _ cross section as a function of @xmath43 with fixed @xmath66 . as previously , gs is satisfied when functions @xmath67 evaluated in terms of @xmath2 follow one curve for all @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "[ figgs ] ) .",
    "this observation is essential in our method : one can construct ratios @xmath69 and check whether they are equal 1 .",
    "before we proceed , let us discuss the choice of kinematical variable @xmath61 which we fix to construct the ratios . in ref .",
    "@xcite we performed analysis of gs in inclusive dis both with fixed @xmath0 ( so - called bjorken @xmath0 binning ) and @xmath66 ( energy binning ) .",
    "although both approaches give similar results the latter is disfavored since hera data are provided in @xmath70 bins  changing bins into @xmath71 introduces additional errors . in ref .",
    "@xcite details of bins change has been presented . on the other hand points with fixed energy span over much wider @xmath43 range what simplifies analysis significantly .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that gs is exhibited by @xmath72 spectra in high - energy hadronic collisions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) where the energy binning is natural .",
    "hera data for charm production are much poorer than for inclusive dis . @xmath73",
    "consist of few points and ratios can not be constructed .",
    "this force us to use energy binning even though data are provided in @xmath70 bins .",
    "here we use the same binning as in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . limiting values @xmath74 , @xmath75",
    "are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "energy @xmath66 is taken as a mean of these values .",
    "number of points in each bin is also displayed .",
    ".limiting values for energy bins , values of energies and number of points in bins for charm production . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to construct ratios of spectra ( [ wspectradef ] ) we choose _ reference energy _",
    "@xmath76 and divide @xmath77 by spectrum with different energy @xmath78 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a value of scaling variable evaluated for @xmath81-th point of @xmath82 .",
    "note that in general @xmath83 so to evaluate numerator of ( [ ratiodef ] ) one needs to interpolate @xmath77 to @xmath84 such that @xmath85 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in what follows we use @xmath86 gev",
    "because it gives the widest range of @xmath2 values and therefore ratios @xmath87 can be calculated for all @xmath78 s .",
    "uncertainty of ratio ( [ ratiodef ] ) is given by : @xmath88 where @xmath89 are experimental errors .",
    "here we neglect interpolation errors and theoretical uncertainty @xmath90 , introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite for inclusive dis , as small comparing to experimental errors .",
    "gs is expected to be present at low @xmath0 so it is profitable to introduce a parameter @xmath91 _ i.e. _ cut - off on bjorken variable @xmath92 .",
    "our aim is to find such @xmath33 ( for given energy @xmath93 and cut - off @xmath91 ) that deviations @xmath94 are minimal . for this purpose",
    "we define the chi - square function:@xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath92 means that we sum over points corresponding to given energy @xmath93 , with @xmath0 values not larger than @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath97 is a number of such points .",
    "function ( [ defchi2 ] ) is a main tool of quantitative study of gs .",
    "let us denote the minimum of @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "uncertainty @xmath100 can be estimated by the condition : @xmath101 it is clear that gs is satisfied when @xmath102 does not depend on energy @xmath66 and values of @xmath103 are around 1 . moreover , since exponent @xmath33 governs behavior of saturation scale it should not depend on quark flavor .",
    "this means that the value of @xmath33 for charm production should be similar to its value for inclusive dis .",
    "this is yet another criterion for gs .    to investigate gs for charm cross section we shall compare results obtained using scaling variables @xmath5 ( [ tau_0 ] ) and @xmath14 ( [ tau_c_full ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath5 is obtained from @xmath14 by setting @xmath104 . in what follows",
    "we shall treat @xmath14 and @xmath5 as the same scaling variable with masses 1.3 gev and 0 respectively .",
    "finally , we set for simplicity @xmath105 gev and @xmath106 .",
    "this can be done since the method of ratios is sensitive only to the relative values of scaling variable and multiplication by constant factor does not change ratios ( [ ratiodef ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath107 and @xmath108 determine value of the saturation scale ( [ qsat ] ) and can be found only using some model for @xmath28 .",
    "in fig .  [ zeswyklammin ] we show @xmath109 for four energy bins ( we omitt @xmath110 gev since it has only 3 points and very large uncertainties ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath102 s obtained for @xmath111 gev are smaller and more flat than those for @xmath104 .",
    "values of @xmath98 evaluated for these @xmath102 s are shown in fig.[wchixcut ] . for zero charm",
    "mass @xmath98 s are greater than 1.5 and reach 3 while for @xmath111 gev do not exceed 1.5 .",
    "this clearly shows that quality of gs is better if one include quark mass in definition of scaling variable .",
    "a word of warning is here in order .",
    "even though @xmath98 s for @xmath111 gev are quite small ( _ i.e. _ @xmath112 ) the statistical reliability of these values is low since number of points in @xmath98 s is 10 at most .    in order to check whether @xmath102 is the same for all energies we define another chi - square function@xmath113 where the sum goes over four energies @xmath114 gev .",
    "minimum of ( [ wchitilde ] ) with respect to @xmath33 is an averaged value of @xmath102 over energies which we denote by @xmath115 .",
    "the error is calculated similarly like in ( [ deltalambda ] ) _ i.e. _ by demanding that @xmath116 changes by @xmath117 when @xmath33 is varied around @xmath118 .    in fig .",
    "[ lamave ] we show comparison of @xmath119 obtained using @xmath104 and @xmath111 gev .",
    "we added also results for inclusive dis data @xcite restricted to the same values of @xmath0 , @xmath43 as used in charm production analysis .",
    "for inclusive dis only scaling variable @xmath5 ( [ tau_0 ] ) was used .    as optimal values of parameters @xmath33",
    "we take @xmath120 .",
    "charm production values for @xmath104 and @xmath111 gev are respectively :    @xmath121    inclusive dis value : @xmath122 note that errors are purely statistical . for the discussion of systematic uncertainties",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can see that exponents obtained for charm production are much larger than for inclusive dis .",
    "this is a clear sign of gs violation .",
    "notice that @xmath123 is closer to @xmath124 than @xmath125 .",
    "this confirms our conclusion that taking into account quark mass improves gs .     as functions of @xmath91 obtained for charm production data with @xmath104 ( black squares ) , @xmath111 gev ( red open circles ) and for inclusive dis data ( blue triangles).,width=325 ]    at the end",

    "@xcite where we applied the same method to the inclusive dis data from hera .",
    "there , however , data are much richer and analysis was performed using also binning in bjorken-@xmath0 variable . in the case of charm production",
    "we were forced to change original @xmath0 bins into energy bins what introduces additional errors .",
    "dipole approach to low @xmath0 dis does not predict exact geometrical scaling in the presence of quark mass .",
    "however , since square of charm mass ( @xmath130 gev@xmath131 ) is small comparing to the most of measured @xmath43 values one should expect that some residual scaling can be present .",
    "indeed , even using standard form scaling variable ( [ tau_0 ] ) scaling can be seen in data ( upper panel in fig .",
    "[ figgs ] ) . after taking into account charm mass ( [ tau_c_full ] ) scaling",

    "value of exponent : @xmath132 is much larger than one obtained for inclusive dis ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "this difference is not theoretically motivated and should be treated as a consequence of scaling violation .",
    "geometrical scaling in charm production ( and also inclusive dis ) was tested in ref .",
    "@xcite with the help of so - called quality factor method .",
    "results obtained there suggest that gs in charm production is basically the same as for the inclusive dis .",
    "in particular for standard form of scaling variable ( [ tau_0 ] ) value of exponent @xmath33 is the same for both cases @xmath134 ( scaling variable ( [ tau_c_full ] ) was not considered ) .",
    "these conclusions are far from those we have drown here .",
    "one should note , however , several important differences between both studies : in ref .",
    "@xcite authors used earlier data from hera ( not combined ) and applied additional kinematical cuts to them ( removed points with small @xmath43 ) .",
    "moreover , values of quality factor as measure of scaling quality are difficult to interpret .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have established that geometrical scaling holds up to @xmath135 .",
    "this is well above domain of saturation physics ( @xmath136 ) and can be predicted both by the dglap and bfkl evolution shames ( see @xcite ) . here , for charm production , we have to our disposal only data with @xmath137 and no sign of strong scaling violation is seen .",
    "one should expect that , similarly as in inclusive dis , @xmath0 region of strong scaling violation is around @xmath138 .",
