    "one uses rigid motions rather than lattice preserving transformations .",
    "the volume and the dehn invariant @xmath100 provide a complete set of invariants .",
    "that is , @xmath101-dimensional polytopes @xmath83 and @xmath82 are scissors congruent if and only if they have the same volume and the same dehn invariant .",
    "the `` only if '' part is relatively easy to see ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) ) , because the dehn invariant is additive , and decompositions of polyhedra satisfy the following two properties .    *",
    "a decomposition edge through a two - dimensional face contributes an angle of @xmath102 , so it does not contribute to the dehn invariant . * a decomposition edge through the interior contributes an angle of @xmath103 , so it does not contribute to the dehn invariant .",
    "this invariant , once constructed , will likely be more appropriate to detecting when two lattice polytopes are @xmath84-equidecomposable into lattice polytopes , in particular , when unimodular triangulations exist .        here",
    ", a lattice polygon is reflexive if it contains a unique interior lattice point , and the length is measured with respect to the lattice .",
