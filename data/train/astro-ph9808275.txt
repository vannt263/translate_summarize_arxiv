    "gravitational microlensing surveys have produced photometric databases of unprecedented usefulness  both in the number of stars monitored and in the quality and length of their time series .",
    "such databases are favorable hunting grounds for rare ( and not - so - rare ) types of variable stars and stellar systems .    among the brightest and most important variable stars are the classical cepheids .",
    "these stars are arguably the most thoroughly understood intrinsic variable from a theoretical standpoint , and are of paramount importance for calibrating the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "microlensing surveys have expanded the number of known cepheids , which have served to clarify our understanding of cepheid pulsation . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the second - overtone ( so ) mode of cepheid pulsation using lmc first / second overtone ( fo / so ) beat cepheids discovered by the macho project .",
    "stobie ( 1969a ) reported the first theoretical findings suggesting that cepheids might be unstable in the so  ( radial ) mode .",
    "his non - linear , radiative calculations predicted the existence of socepheids for low   and high @xmath4 , which lead stobie ( 1969b ) to suggest that such cepheids might comprise the short - period peak in the smc cepheid period distribution . while some early investigations had difficulty in producing so  cepheids ( e.g. , cox 1980 mentioned the so  mode `` is frequently not even pulsationally unstable in the linear theory '' ) , most nonlinear calculations ( e.g. , chiosi , wood & capitano 1993 ) have confirmed the positive growth rate of the so  mode for cepheid surface gravities and temperatures , thus predicting that so  cepheids should exist , provided that real stars could reach the region of instability by normal evolution .",
    "observational evidence of so  mode excitation in singly - periodic cepheids has lagged theory by more than two decades .",
    "it was only in the 1980s that mode identification of radial pulsators became observationally feasible , guided by predicted period ratios from linear and non - linear calculations : i.e. , @xmath5 for the first - overtone ( fo ) and fundamental ( f ) modes , and @xmath6 .",
    "two methods are widely used to identify in which modes a cepheid pulsates : fourier decomposition of lightcurves , which has become the standard for comparing theory and observation ( e.g. , moskalik , buchler & marom 1992 ) ; and position on the observed p@xmath1l  relation for extragalactic cepheids ( the f  p@xmath1l  relation or the fo  p@xmath1l  relation , as delimited by bhm - vitense 1994 or alcock et al .",
    "1995 ) .    to date",
    ", there exists one possible singly - periodic so  cepheid candidate : hr 7308 , a galactic population i cepheid with constant period ( 1.491 days ) , but varying radial velocity ( 2.3@xmath135 km s@xmath7 ) and v semi - amplitude ( 0.06@xmath10.17 mag ; andrievsky , kovtyukh & usenko 1994 ) . although hr 7308 is consistent with some socepheid models ( burki et al .",
    "1986 ; fabregat , suso & reglero 1990 ; simon 1985 ) , there are observations which identify it as a fo  or f  pulsator ( bersier 1996 ; bersier & burki 1996 ) .",
    "thus , it is fair to say that no singly - periodic so  cepheids have yet been conclusively identified .    unlike singly - periodic pulsators , beat cepheids act as calibrators for mode identification : because they pulsate in two modes simultaneously , their period ratios identify their modes of pulsation .",
    "prior to the 1980s , only f / fo  beat cepheids were known to exist .",
    "co aur , the first ( and , so far , only ) galactic fo / so  beat cepheid , was discovered and analysed by mantegazza ( 1983 ) and antonello & mantegazza ( 1984 ) .",
    "however , one star constituted too small a sample for extracting the characteristics of so  cepheid pulsators .",
    "this situation changed when alcock et al .",
    "( 1995 ) provided the first conclusive observational evidence of so  mode excitation by reporting 15 lmc fo / so  beat cepheids .",
    "alcock et al .  also suggested that singly - periodic so  cepheids might be found in the macho project lmc database .",
    "the motivation for discovering so  cepheids is straightforward : the common distance of such stars in the lmc , as well as its small amount of differential reddening should allow us to determine unambiguously the @xmath8 region where so   excitation occurs .    in subsequent sections",
    "we take the first steps towards pursuing this goal , making use of the results of fourier decomposition of lmc fo / so  beat cepheid lightcurves to estimate the fourier parameters of singly - periodic so  pulsators .",
    "we utilized an expanded sample ( compared to alcock et al.1995 ; welch et al .",
    "1997 ) of 47 confirmed fo / so  beat cepheid lightcurves in the lmc discovered by the macho project . only 45 beat cepheids are unique : there are two beat cepheids which were observed in two overlapping macho fields .",
    "we refer the reader to alcock et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for a description of our observations and the beat cepheid identification process .",
    "briefly , each star has two - bandpass photometry ( a ` v ' and ` r ' band ) taken over four years of observation , which results in a time - series for each star of 6001000 observation epochs .",
    "automatic reduction and analysis routines for these lightcurves provide quality flags for each observation .",
    "we used these flags to remove any observations which were suspect because of possible cosmic ray events , bad or missing pixels , or poor image quality .",
    "this typically resulted in the rejection of up to 30% of the observations for a given star , since some of these stars are relatively faint .",
    "each beat cepheid in our sample can be characterized as pulsating with two non - commensurate frequencies , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and their linear combinations : i.e. , any frequencies @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 integer .",
    "these frequencies are attributed to fo  and sointeraction within the star .",
    "our goal is go isolate the so  mode of pulsation for each beat cepheid through fourier decomposition : i.e. , we model a given beat cepheid s lightcurve by a truncated fourier series , examining only the model terms that belong to solely the ( fo  and ) somodes , ignoring any mixing terms ( which typically have much smaller amplitudes than he principle terms ) . as pardo & poretti ( 1997 ) pointed out , traditional fourier analysis involved modeling lightcurves by truncated fourier series of an _ a priori _ order , without testing to see which model terms were warranted . to avoid this concern",
    ", we opted to code the comprehensive cleanest algorithm of foster ( 1995 ; 1996a ; 1996b ) for joint frequency analysis and lightcurve modeling .",
    "foster s algorithm utilizes an accurate power spectrum estimator ( the date - compensated discrete fourier transform ( dcdft ) of ferraz - mello 1981 ) and provides both frequency and model parameter uncertainties .",
    "as well , foster ( 1996a ; 1996b ) provides statistical tests of significance for frequencies in a spectrum , and a thorough discussion of how cleanest differs from other well - known spectral analysis routines .",
    "our analysis of each beat cepheid resembles that of pardo & poretti ( 1997 ) . on the first application to a lightcurve",
    ", our coding of cleanest uses the dcdft of the photometry to produce a power spectrum in the frequency range @xmath14 to @xmath15 in stepsizes of @xmath16 ( the frequency resolution ) .",
    "@xmath17 is the total time span of the observations for a star , and @xmath18 the minimum time separation between successive observations .",
    "if any frequencies in the dcdft are adopted as significant ( the criteria for selection are presented below ) , each frequency @xmath19 is modeled by @xmath20 and @xmath21 terms , plus an overall constant , as prescribed in foster ( 1995 ) .",
    "the resulting model is subtracted from the original photometry , forming residuals ; these residuals are subjected to another dcdft , and the process is iterated until no significant periodic variations remain in the residuals . each time",
    "a dcdft of the data or residuals has been performed , cleanest seeks to find the @xmath22-tuple of frequencies which gives the best description of the data , by varying each frequency in its neighbourhood until a maximum of foster ( 1996a ; 1996b ) s model amplitude is found .",
    "we allowed cleanest to perform this frequency variation without requiring that model frequencies retained their expected relations to @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; the fact that most model frequencies did retain their expected relation to @xmath9 and @xmath10 attested to their authenticity .    what determines whether or not a frequency is significant ?",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 were usually found to be the two most powerful frequencies in the first couple dcdfts of the data and @xmath10 were confirmed by the expectation that @xmath23 ( alcock et al .",
    "1995 ) . ] , and usually passed foster ( 1996a ) s test for statistical significance . unfortunately , most linear combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 that we found in dcdfts failed to pass tests of significance .",
    "we thus adopted a frequency as significant if it was a linear combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( within estimated uncertainties ) ; if it appeared as one of the 20 most powerful frequencies in a residual dcdft ; and if it was reasonable ( e.g. , we would not have modeled a frequency that seemed to be @xmath24 if we had not previously detected @xmath25 or @xmath10 in our analysis ) .",
    "we terminated our modeling when no frequencies consistent with a linear combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 could be identified in the 20 most powerful frequencies in a residual dcdft . in most cases",
    ", we also had to adopt a model term with a frequency close to 1.003 day@xmath7 , corresponding to one sidereal day , to make apparent further linear combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in a few cases , we also adopted a model term with one very low frequency , typically around 0.0005 day@xmath7 , in order to permit further analysis .",
    "scheduling of observations were responsible for the appearance of the sidereal frequency .",
    "the small frequency could arise from a zero - point shift in observations , or from a long - period amplitude evolution of the zero - point ( mean ) of a star , or perhaps from some other cause .",
    "whatever its genesis in a given star , a small frequency has no appreciable effect on our analysis or conclusions , and we do not discuss these further .    in order to test for robustness of cleanest s model parameters , we subjected all model parameters in our final cleanest models to a marquardt fitting algorithm , a @xmath26 minimization method which pragmatically alternates between a ` steepest descent ' ( or gradient - search ) algorithm when @xmath26 changes rapidly near a given set of model parameters , and a first - order model parameter expansion when @xmath26 changes little near a given set of model parameters ( e.g. , bevington & robinson 1992 ) .",
    "most model coefficients and frequencies remained within the uncertainties of their cleanest values , and retained their relationship to @xmath9 and @xmath10 within uncertainties .    in table",
    "[ pertable ] we present identifiers , periods , and period ratios for our fo / so  stars .",
    "there are two more fo / so  stars than tabulated in welch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . while our results here are not as precise as those listed by welch et al .",
    ", they supercede those values . the uncertainties derived in this study",
    "are also believed to be better estimates .",
    "finally , figure [ example - fit ] illustrates the results of our fit procedure for a typical fo / so  beat cepheid .",
    "we show lightcurves of the composite , fo , and so  modes of pulsation , along with frequency information .",
    "the fo  and so  mode lightcurves were derived by prewhitening observations with any model terms not belonging to the displayed mode , as well as mixing terms between modes .",
    "the lightcurve shown had the magnitude - average of its observations removed , and is on the instrumental v - band of the macho project .",
    "our analysis yielded 37 beat cepheids with robust @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 frequencies ( with @xmath12 up to 4 ) , as well as 8 stars with the above plus the @xmath29 harmonic . in no case",
    "did we detect harmonics higher than @xmath29 for the so  mode .",
    "we used model coefficients from the fo  and so  model terms to form the usual lightcurve geometry indicators : @xmath30 , the amplitude ratio of the @xmath31th harmonic and the ` base ' frequency model terms for a mode ; and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the phase of a mode s @xmath31th harmonic , and @xmath34 the phase of its ` base ' frequency model term and @xmath35 is commonly attributed to simon & lee ( 1981 ) , but related quantities were used and defined in e.g. , payne - gaposchkin ( 1947 ) and kukarkin & parenago ( 1937 ) .",
    "note that @xmath35 is independent of reference epoch . ] .",
    "the absence of any stars with soharmonics higher than @xmath29 clearly limits us to @xmath36 and @xmath37 for descriptions of the so  mode s lightcurve shape , even though up to @xmath38 and @xmath39 were possible for the fo  mode .",
    "we will present these higher - order fourier decomposition parameters for the fo  mode in a future paper .",
    "the fourier parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the fo  and somodes are shown in figures [ r21 ] and [ p21 ] , plotted against the fo  and so  mode periods , respectively : i.e. , as their singly - periodic counterparts would appear in such plots .",
    "all stars appear in the fosequences .",
    "only a small fraction of our beat cepheids clearly exhibited @xmath29 , needed to form @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in order to try and draw out as much information on the so  mode as possible",
    ", we adopted a @xmath29 from the best - fit @xmath10 for each of the 37 stars which did not exhibit a @xmath29 variation using cleanest , and attempted to fit model terms for such a frequency with our marquardt algorithm , keeping only those stars whose best - fit result was consistent with our initial guess .",
    "eighteen extra stars had such ` stable ' @xmath29 frequencies .",
    "we added them to figures [ r21 ] and [ p21 ] , broadening our so  mode sequences to a greater range of periods ( @xmath40p@xmath41 days ) .",
    "the remaining 19 stars failed to have a stable @xmath29 and so have a so  mode with a purely sinusoidal lightcurve shape : i.e. , @xmath42 . these 19 stars are shown in figure [ r21 ] , but not in figure [ p21 ] , as their @xmath37 values are undefined .",
    "recent theoretical investigations examining the so  mode of cepheid pulsation suggest that so  cepheids can have periods of 10 days or more ( e.g. , the comprehensive study of chiosi et al .",
    "we are in the position to add some observational constraints on this long - period limit .",
    "figure [ r21-p21-for - lmc - cephs ] shows @xmath36 and @xmath37 for all known lmc singly - periodic cepheids with @xmath36 uncertainties less than 0.05 and @xmath37 uncertainties less than 0.1 rad , discovered by the macho project ( adapted from welch et al .",
    "over 1400 cepheids are displayed , but all avoid combinations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in regions we expect for a so  pulsator ( the hatched regions in the figure , derived from our figures [ r21 ] and [ p21 ] ) . if figure [ r21-p21-for - lmc - cephs ] s sample of cepheids is indicative of lmc cepheids as a whole over their period range , we would expect to see at least some stars in the longer - period so  sequence range  say around 1 day  but we do not see any .",
    "this is true even when restrictions on @xmath36 s and @xmath37 s uncertainties are removed : no so  candidates appear in the shaded region of the @xmath36p portion of the figure .",
    "those stars which lie in the shaded region of the @xmath37p portion of figure [ r21-p21-for - lmc - cephs ] have @xmath36 values consistent with fo  and f  pulsators .",
    "the lack of p @xmath43 1 day cepheid candidates may be the result of a bias  in that figure [ r21-p21-for - lmc - cephs ] s cepheids were selected for periods of about 1 day or longer , as well as cmd position , p ",
    "l position , and lightcurve shape .",
    "however , the lack of an obvious third fourier parameter sequence at periods longer than 1 day is probably real , as one would surmise from the greater density of stars in figure [ r21-p21-for - lmc - cephs ] to longer periods .",
    "this suggests that socepheids are indeed a rare species",
    ".    it would be intriguing if the @xmath36 so  sequence mimicked the ` v ' shape of the fo  and f  mode @xmath36 sequences of figure [ r21-p21-for - lmc - cephs ]",
    ". what we see in figure [ r21 ] would be the short - period commencement of such a sequence , and we would expect , analogous to the sequences in figure [ r21-p21-for - lmc - cephs ] , a drop to zero followed by a sharp rise in @xmath36 on the long - period side of this drop . such behaviour has been predicted for so  cepheids , attributed to a resonance between the second and sixth overtone modes around so  periods of 1 day ( antonello & kanbur 1997 ) . presumably , the rising branch of @xmath36 for the so  mode would be hidden in the fo  sequence we see in figure [ r21-p21-for - lmc - cephs ] .",
    "this would limit our ability to discern so  cepheids based on lightcurve shape to stars with periods less than about 1.4 days .",
    "the first investigation of lightcurve shape for so  radial pulsators by stellingwerf , gautschy & dickens ( 1987 ) suggested such stars would have the characteristic ` sawtooth ' nature of f  lightcurves , based on fourier decompositions of one - zone models .",
    "while this suggestion was used to identify so  rr lyrae stars ( the ` rre ' stars of alcock et al.1996 ) , the fourier parameters of figures [ r21 ] and [ p21 ] do not comply with such a suggestion for so  cepheids , which would require @xmath44 and @xmath45 rad .",
    "this non - conformity is not unexpected : as our referee noted , one - zone models of rr lyrae - type pulsations may not have much bearing on actual lightcurves of so  cepheids .",
    "antonello & kanbur ( 1997 ) have recently completed a so  cepheid pulsation study which indicates lightcurves of a type `` more sinusoidal than [ fo ] ones , at least for short periods '' ( about 1 day or less ) .",
    "observationally , we find sinusoidal  or nearly sinusoidal  lightcurves to be the norm for the cepheid so  mode .",
    "pardo & poretti ( 1997 ) suggested as much for co aur , the sole galactic fo / so  beat cepheid , when they failed to detect its @xmath29 frequency .",
    "future observational and theoretical investigations should be guided by this finding : that so  cepheids have a symmetric , nearly - sinusoidal light variation over their pulsational cycle .",
    "this has a bearing on nomenclature .",
    "some authors use the term ` s  cepheid ' ( e.g. , antonello , poretti , & reduzzi 1990 ; morgan 1995 ) for stars that are , largely , fo  cepheids ( as shown most recently for galactic cepheids by pardo & poretti 1997 ) .",
    "we have shown that so  cepheids are distinctly more sinusoidal in lightcurve shape than fo  and f  cepheids from their low @xmath36 values .",
    "it might be better to refer to s  cepheids instead as first overtone ( fo ) cepheids in the future , to avoid ambiguities .",
    "during the extraction and inspection of variables from a section of the cmd for our four years of lmc observation , we discovered macho*05:03:39.6@xmath170:04:32 , a small - amplitude sinusoidal pulsator . in figures",
    "[ pl ] and [ cmd ] we show its position in the p  l relation and cmd for known lmc cepheids .",
    "although it occupies sparsely populated regions in these diagrams , it is , most probably , a classical cepheid .",
    "we transformed this star s macho v- and r - band photometry to v and r@xmath46 using our latest transformation equations , and subjected its observations to the fitting procedure outlined above .",
    "the results for the v band are displayed as figure [ v - fit ] .",
    "we found all bandpasses were best described by a single component , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is one of v or r@xmath46 , and @xmath49 jd 2448628.632 .",
    "the coefficients from these fits are presented in table [ coeffs ] .",
    "a frequency corresponding to 1.003 days@xmath7 was also adopted in both fits , but made no difference to their appearance .",
    "macho*05:03:39.6@xmath170:04:32  stands as a ( serendipitous ) first extragalactic so  cepheid candidate .",
    "we are , at present , actively searching for more singly - periodic socepheids in the macho lmc and smc databases .",
    "any additional so  candidates will be reported in a future paper .",
    "the number of short - period pulsators will increase as one moves to lower metallicity environments ( e.g. , lipunova 1992 ) .",
    "thus , the smc should provide an even better hunting ground for beat cepheids and so  candidates when the macho project analysis of smc photometry is complete .",
