    "recently type 0 string theories attract much interest in the study of non - supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite .",
    "type 0 string theories can be obtained from the worldsheet of type ii string theories by performing a non - chiral gso projection @xcite .",
    "the resulting theories have world sheet supersymmetry but no space - time supersymmetry .",
    "the crucial differences of type 0 theories with type ii theories is to have the doubling of ramond - ramond(rr ) fields and the tachyon .",
    "thus they all have twice as many d - branes .",
    "the application of this model to the study of non - susy gauge theory was realized by klebanov and tseytlin@xcite .",
    "they considered the theory of n coincident electrically charged d3-branes . using the near - horizon d3-brane",
    ", they constructed an su(n ) gauge theory with six adjoint scalars and studied its behavior .",
    "they observed that the doubled rr flux in type 0 dual background stabilizes the tachyon .",
    "since then a number of papers on this mode appeared @xcite . in a subsequent paper , klebanov and tseytlin@xcite",
    "also considered the theory of n electric d@xmath6-branes coincident with n magnetic d3@xmath7-branes .",
    "the non - susy theory is the su(n)@xmath8su(n ) gauge theory coupled to six adjoint scalars of the first su(n ) , six adjoint scalars of the second su(n ) , and fermions in the bifundamental representation(four weyl spinors in the ( n,@xmath9 ) and another four in the ( @xmath9,n ) ) .",
    "the d@xmath10-brane bound states of the type 0 theories are somewhat similar to those of the type ii theories .",
    "however , the essential difference with type ii theories comes from the existence of tachyon . in the previous work of one of the authors@xcite , the low energy scattering of fields in the type 0b theory for electric d@xmath11-branes attepmted . in this analysis",
    "the dilaton field can be used as a test field .",
    "one of the simplest way to see the role of tachyon in type 0 theories is to consider the intersecting d@xmath12-branes .",
    "the d@xmath10-brane bound states can be intersected according to the same rules of the type ii theories .",
    "the d@xmath2-d@xmath3 brane black hole thus is constructed to show that the corresponding near - horizon geometry is ads@xmath13s@xmath14t@xmath15 and it has asymptotically flat space at infinity .",
    "it is shown that the tachyon field can be stabilized in ads@xmath16s@xmath17t@xmath15@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will study the role of the tachyon in d5@xmath18-d1@xmath18 brane black hole , by comparing it with the fixed scalars .",
    "further , we will present a complete solution to the stability by analyzing the potentials surrounding the d5@xmath18-d1@xmath18 brane black hole .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ blackhole ]",
    ", we briefly sketch the d5@xmath18-d1@xmath18 brane black hole in the type 0b string theory .",
    "we set up the perturbation for all fields around this black hole background in sec .",

    "here we consider a class of 5d black holes representing the bound state of the d5@xmath18-d1@xmath18 brane system compactified on t@xmath20t@xmath21s@xmath22 ) .",
    "this black hole can also be obtained as a solution to the semiclassical action of type 0b string compactified on t@xmath23 .",
    "the effective action for a 5d black hole is given by@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the kaluza - klein(kk ) field strength along the string direction(s@xmath22 ) , @xmath26 are the electric components of the ramond - ramond(rr ) three - form @xmath27 and @xmath28 are dual to the magnetic components of the rr three - form @xmath27 .",
    "here we omit the analysis of the 6d dilaton @xmath29 , since it is just a minimally decoupled scalar .",
    "on the other hand , the scalars @xmath5 and @xmath30 interact with the gauge fields and are examples of the fixed scalar .",
    "@xmath5 is related to the scale of the internal torus(t@xmath15 ) , while @xmath30 is related to the scale of the kk circle(s@xmath22 ) . @xmath31 and",

    "comparing with the results of type iib theory @xcite , the new ingredients are the tachyon and the doubling of the rr fields .",

    "the role of @xmath83 remains obscure .",
    "hence we no longer consider this field .",
    "here we observe from ( [ nu - decoupled ] ) and ( [ t - decoupled ] ) that if the mass term in ( [ t - decoupled ] ) is absent , two equations are exactly the same form .",

    "then the relevant fields become @xmath92 and @xmath93 , but the graviton modes @xmath70 are irrelevant to our interest . for @xmath94 , the equations ( [ nu - decoupled ] ) and ( [ t - decoupled ] ) lead to @xmath95 considering @xmath96 , for @xmath97 and introducing a tortoise coordinate @xmath98@xcite",

    "as ( [ eqom ] ) stands , it is far from the schrdinger - type equation .",
    "the @xmath108-dependence is a matter of peculiar interest to us compared with the schwarzschild black hole potentials @xmath109@xcite .",
    "this makes the interpretation of @xmath105 as a potential difficult .",
    "this arises because @xmath110 is very large as @xmath111 for @xmath112 in the near - horizon . in order for @xmath105 to be a potential ,",
    "it is necessary to take the low energy limit of @xmath113 .",
    "it is suitable to be @xmath114 . and @xmath115 is of order @xmath116 and thus it can be ignored in comparison with the remaing ones .",
    "now we can define a potential @xmath117 .",
    "hence , in the low energy limit(@xmath113 ) , eq.([eqom ] ) becomes as the schrdinger - type equation .",
    "first we consider the near - horizon geometry , which corresponds to the limit of @xmath118 such that the dilute gas limit ( @xmath119 ) holds . in this limit",
    "one finds ads@xmath16s@xmath17t@xmath15 . in the near - horizon , as is shown in fig .",
    "1 , the potential of the fixed scalar(@xmath120 ) takes exactly the same form of the tachyon(@xmath121 ) .",
    "this means that in the near - horizon the roles of the fixed scalar(@xmath5 ) and the tachyon(@xmath0 ) are the same .",
    "now let us observe the far - region behavior of their potentials . in the asymptotic region(@xmath122 )",
    "@xmath123 approaches to zero , whereas @xmath124 goes to @xmath125(see fig .",
    "2 ) . with @xmath124 one finds an exponentially growing mode ( @xmath126 ) from eq .",
    "( [ eqom])@xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath5 plays a role of the good test field , while @xmath84 induces an instability of the flat space .",
    "[ ij9904-far ]",
    "let us first discuss the role of a fixed scalar @xmath5 in the greybody factor calculation(hawking radiation ) .",
    "although @xmath5 is related to the scale of @xmath37 , it turns out to be the 10d dilaton(@xmath127 ) when @xmath128 . for @xmath77 case ,",
    "one finds the same linearized equation for the harmonic , dilaton gauge , and k - k setting @xcite .",
    "this means that the fixed scalar(@xmath5 ) gives us a gauge - invariant result . in the low energy limit ( @xmath113 ) ,",
    "the s - wave semiclassical greybody factor takes the form@xcite @xmath129    on the other hand , @xmath130 ) is entirely determined by the scale(@xmath131 ) of the kk circle(@xmath39 ) when @xmath29 is turned off .",
    "the semiclassical result of its greybody factor takes the form @xmath132 however , in the previous work@xcite we found out that @xmath30 depends on the gauge choice .",
    "the fixed scalar @xmath5 is clearly understood as a good test field for studying the d5@xmath18-d1@xmath18 brane black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "the role of @xmath30 as a test field is obscure because it is a gauge - dependent field and gives rise to some disagreement for the cross section .",
    "the tachyon plays the same role of @xmath5 in the near - horizon geometry . but",
    "this induces an instability of minkowski space(see fig .",
    "2 ) . hence the tachyon seems not to be a good test field to investigate the quantum aspect of the d5@xmath18-d1@xmath18 brane black hole .",
    "finally let us comment on the stability problem of the near - horizon geometry .",
    "it is known that while the minkowski vacuum is unstable in type 0 string theory , the ads@xmath133s@xmath23 with self - dual 5-form flux should be a stable background for sufficiently small radius@xcite .",
    "the rr fields work to stabilize the tachyon in the near - horizon .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "1 that the ads@xmath16s@xmath17t@xmath15 is stable because @xmath120 and @xmath121 take the shapes of the potential barrier . from eq.([t - harmonic ] ) , if there do not exist the rr fields ( @xmath134 ) , one finds a potential well for the tachyon , which induces an instability in the near - horizon@xcite .",
    "however , thanks to the rr fields , one obtains a potential barrier .",
    "this shows obviously that the rr fields can work to stabilize the tachyon in the near - horizon .",
