    "the theory of _ complex networks _ is a primary tool in the interdisciplinary research in complex systems .",
    "it provides a simple ( coarse - grained ) description of natural as well as social and technological complex systems , by means of mapping their elements and interactions on the vertices and the edges of a graph @xcite .",
    "different systems correspond to microscopically different networks , but their general statistical properties may display similarities . using the tools of statistical physics in analyzing experimental data ,",
    "researchers have obtained important insights on the structure of these complex networks , discovering universal properties that are common to very different systems . in particular , most of real networks seem to be sparse , with a very small diameter ( small - world property ) , and to present large fluctuations in the connectivity ( degree ) of the nodes . + the theoretical models pretending to explain the origins of these universal properties can be roughly divided in two classes : static models , in which the network structure is the result of some precise combinatorial assignment , and growing models , in which new nodes attach to a pre - existing network by means of a given number of links @xcite .",
    "much less attention was instead devoted to the other very important issue concerning the relation between networks structure and the processes used to collect the experimental data .",
    "some questions arise naturally : are the experimental data really reliable ? can the ubiquity of some properties be the result of systematic biases introduced by the sampling process itself ? + these questions have been recently addressed in a series of works @xcite that study the sampling of networks from both static and dynamical points of view . among them , the work by petermann and de los rios @xcite is the first in which the idea that different generation algorithms may lead to different topological properties is exploited to show analytically that the observed power - law degree distributions can be an artifact of biases affecting the sampling techniques .",
    "+ this issue is particularly relevant for the physical internet , that is the prototype of a complex network : a huge number of computers are connected together to form a continuously evolving , self - organizing network , on which a large variety of dynamical processes take place @xcite .",
    "as the robustness and performances of large technological networks strongly depend on their topology , an accurate , unbiased knowledge of the internet is necessary to support the work of practitioners in improving its structure and functioning .",
    "+ motivated by the importance of correctly knowing network s topology , the present work is devoted to clarify the mechanisms governing the main techniques used in the dynamical sampling of complex networks . in order to accomplish this task , we first present the general framework that applies to a large class of tree - like dynamical processes , then we focus on the _ traceroute sampling _ of networks with homogeneous and heterogeneous degree profiles .",
    "we show that the role played by the dynamics is very different in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks . in the latter case",
    ", that should correspond to the case of the internet , the sampling process introduces some level of inhomogeneity that paradoxically increases the sampling accuracy of the tail of the degree distribution .",
    "+ our results are in agreement with previous analytical and numerical achievements , but allow a more unitary view of the problem .",
    "dynamical sampling techniques are examples of the interplay between networks topology and the dynamics occurring on it .",
    "therefore the dynamical approach presented in this paper could be considered as a theoretical improvement with respect to previous analytical studies based on nodes exposure methods @xcite , that are essentially static algorithms . + moreover , our method can be easily adapted to study other sampling algorithms expressly designed to acquire ego - centric views of a network , such as network s tomography @xcite and crawling algorithms in community networks ( the www , p2p networks , etc . )",
    "similar dynamical patterns are observed also in network processes that are not directly related to sampling , such as epidemics @xcite , rumors spreading @xcite , diffusion of innovations @xcite and threshold models @xcite .",
    "+ in summary , we provide a unified description of a class of dynamical phenomena in terms of tree - like evolving structures on networks , and explain how the dynamical rules influence the emerging topological properties , by focusing on the degree distribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we present the general theoretical formalism that can be used to study the degree distribution generated by tree - like processes on networks . the important application to the traceroute problem",
    "is discussed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "some conclusions are presented in section  [ sec4 ] together with examples of other possible applications .",
    "among the various types of algorithms and dynamical models evolving on networks , we take into account those corresponding to the following general dynamical picture , that is also valid for the special case of traceroute - like explorations .",
    "let us assume the process starts from a single node and propagates iteratively throughout the network .",
    "at each temporal step , some nodes at the interface of the growing cluster are selected and some of their still unreached neighbors are visited .",
    "the latter ones become part of the interface , while the former interfacial nodes are moved to the bulk of the cluster ( a sketch of the dynamics is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) . during the dynamics",
    "we can always identify three distinct classes of nodes : bulk , interfacial , and unreached nodes .",
    "when the above process takes place on a random network , in the limit of large network s size @xmath0 , the overall dynamics is well represented by the temporal evolution of some mean - field quantities , the densities of bulk nodes @xmath1 , interfacial nodes @xmath2 , and unreached nodes @xmath3 .",
    "obviously , @xmath4 always during the dynamics .",
    "+ on a generic random network , however , the degree is not fixed , the nodes being divided in degree classes .",
    "the global densities are replaced by degree - dependent partial densities @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . the partial density for unreached nodes of degree @xmath8",
    "is defined as the fraction of nodes of degree @xmath8 that are still unreached at time @xmath9 .",
    "the normalization relation is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the degree distribution of the underlying network .",
    "the other quantities are defined similarly . + more in general , one may be interested in situations in which the network is still maximally random ( with degree distribution @xmath11 ) but with some degree correlations , expressed by the conditional probability @xmath12 that a node of degree @xmath8 is linked to a node of degree @xmath13 .",
    "one can also consider the nodes divided in _ types _",
    "@xmath14 , i.e. discrete or continuous states defined on the nodes .",
    "types are used to create multi - partite networks and to encode some non - topological feature .",
    "another way to account for non - topological properties is that of putting weights on the links , that depend only on the degrees and the types of the extremities .",
    "link weights may account for dynamical properties of the process , such as the transmissibility of a disease @xcite .",
    "the internal structure of the population is taken into account defining degree - dependent and type - dependent partial densities of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the global densities are recovered by averaging over all distributions , i.e. @xmath18 . in order to simplify the formalism , here on",
    "we limit our analysis to single - type undirected random markovian networks @xcite , that are maximally random graphs completely defined by the degree distribution @xmath11 and the degree correlations @xmath12 .",
    "+ according to this mean - field approximated description of the processes , the temporal evolution of the partial densities satisfies a system of differential equations of the type , @xmath19 where the arguments of the functions @xmath20 depend on the general form of the dynamics described above .",
    "for instance , @xmath21 is not expected to depend on unreached nodes , @xmath22 on the bulk nodes , etc .",
    "the system is generally coupled and non - linear , and admits an explicit solution only in very special cases .",
    "+ in statistical physics and theoretical biology , continuous mean - field dynamical equations are commonly used to study models of population dynamics .",
    "the dynamical picture emerging from these mean - field models allows to understand the qualitative behavior of complex phenomena occurring in real systems . at the same time",
    ", it is worth noting that the rigorous derivation of differential equations for random processes on random graphs has been introduced in the mathematic literature only recently , by wormald @xcite , and then applied to several problems , including algorithms for the generation of random graphs with a given degree sequence @xcite and random k - sat problems @xcite .",
    "differential equations method provides a powerful tool to prove rigorous bounds for interesting quantities ( e.g. distribution s moments ) in discrete - time combinatorial processes .",
    "here we limit our analysis to a qualitative topological characterization of the emerging degree distribution obtained within a purely mean - field statistical physics approach . however , a rigorous formalization of the present approach is desirable as well .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath23 of a subnetwork is related to the degree distribution @xmath11 of the underlying one by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the degree distribution , that defines the probability of picking up a node of degree @xmath26 in the original network , and @xmath27 is the conditional probability of observing a node of degree @xmath8 in the subnetwork if its real degree in the complete network is @xmath26 . in a dynamical framework",
    ", the sampling probability depends on the temporal evolution of the overall process . at the beginning , the neighborhood of interfacial nodes is mainly composed of unreached ones , whereas in the final stage of the dynamics most of the nodes",
    "have already been visited .",
    "the probabilities @xmath25 and @xmath27 are thus replaced by time - dependent quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 , that are defined by the evolution rule of the dynamical processes itself .",
    "+ using the properties of the dynamics , @xmath28 can be expressed as the probability of picking up a node of degree @xmath26 among the interfacial nodes of the growing cluster at a time @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "then , the way in which the neighbors of this node are selected and visited depends strictly on the details of the dynamical model .",
    "when the growing cluster has a tree - like structure , a node of degree @xmath26 has only one incoming edge , and the remaining @xmath31 links are used to propagate towards unreached neighbors .",
    "let us call @xmath32 the probability to visit a neighbor of degree @xmath13 of an interfacial node of degree @xmath26 ( it is a function of @xmath33 ) , the conditional probability @xmath29 becomes @xmath34 \\right]}^{k-1 } { \\left[1 -   \\sum_{h }",

    "we have also introduced the joint degree distribution @xmath38 ( of observing a node of degree @xmath8 with real degree @xmath26 ) , that will be useful in the following .",
    "+ the generalizations to multi - type and weighted networks are straightforward once one has correctly considered the evolution equations for the partial densities of bulk , interfacial and unreached nodes . again",
    ", the use of the bernoulli sampling technique ( binomial probability ) in selecting neighboring nodes is justified by the spreading like character of the dynamics considered here . for different classes of dynamical processes ,",

    "we will show that the tail of the degree distribution of a power - law random graph is sampled with negligible bias , even in single - source experiments .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that high degree nodes arrive at the interface of the process almost immediately , and their neighbors are fairly sampled with a probability that depends only weakly on the dynamics .",

    "let us consider the sampling formula @xmath137}^{k } { \\left[1 - \\bar{u}(t ) \\right]}^{\\ell -k } ~ dt\\ ] ] and approximate it for @xmath116 considering that 1 ) during most of the dynamics the quantity @xmath115 assumes the scaling form @xmath138 , and 2 ) the binomial probability can be approximated by a gaussian peaked around its maximum , i.e. @xmath139 . a rough estimate can be done performing the gaussian integral at the saddle - point or , in an equivalent way , recalling a property of dirac delta functions , i.e. @xmath140 , where @xmath141 are the zeros of @xmath142 and @xmath143 is the derivative of the function @xmath144 in these points . for large @xmath8 and @xmath26 , @xmath145 , thus @xmath146 ( in which @xmath147 is the time at which @xmath148 for given values of @xmath8 and @xmath26 ) .",

    "the result is in agreement with a recent analysis by cohen and coworkers @xcite , in which some rigorous bounds for the traceroute biases in power - law networks are obtained using the exposure technique .",

    "the study of the interplay between topological and dynamical properties of networks is of primary interest in the current research on complex systems . with the present work ,",
    "we introduce in this framework a general method to investigate the topological properties of growing clusters that are dynamically defined by a given class of spreading processes and algorithms .",
    "these are processes that starting from a single source span the whole network , traversing all nodes only once .",
    "the temporal evolution is defined by means of a system of differential equations for the ( partial ) densities of bulk , interfacial , and unreached nodes .",
    "+ our approach , that allows to compute analytically or numerically the degree distribution of the emerging tree - like structure , is based on the idea that during its evolution the dynamics performs a sampling of the local structure of the underlying network . as the sampling rate depends on the dynamical properties themselves ,",
    "the degree distribution of the emerging subnetwork may differ considerably from that of the original network . the generalization to study multiple - source processes",
    "is also discussed , at least in the approximation that the overall structure is obtained merging together collections of independent single - source processes .",
    "+ a natural application of the method presented here consists in the analysis of the dynamical sampling of networks .",
    "we have provided a deeper insight in the qualitative behavior of traceroute - like processes , shedding light on the dynamical mechanism at the origin of the observed topology .",
    "the reasons for the different sampling accuracy observed in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks should be now clear . in particular , we have shown that on homogeneous networks ,    * in a single source sampling , the network is observed to have a power - law degree distribution with exponent @xmath156 up to a cut - off about the original average degree @xmath42 ; * increasing the number of sources destroys the power - law behavior , but a fair sampling requires about @xmath157 sources ; * `` metric '' correlations ( that can be associated to the betweenness centrality of nodes ) favor a better sampling of the local topology for increasing number of sources .      *",
    "high - degree nodes are preferentially sampled at the beginning of the process , and with higher accuracy ( in this case high - degree nodes are essentially those with highest betweenness ) ; * in single - source experiments , power - law degree distributions are sampled with negligible biases ; * the overall sampling of the degree distribution becomes very accurate with just few sources .",
    "we believe that a good understanding of these kind of processes is fundamental in order to improve the performances of current dynamical sampling techniques applied to technological networks such as the internet and the web . + as mentioned in the introduction , there are other dynamical processes that can be described using the present approach , from the epidemic spreading , to broadcast trees and search techniques .",
    "we just mention a couple of cases that may find further developments .",
    "one consists in a recently proposed model of search in social networks , in which the search efficiency decays with the distance @xcite .",

    "the limit in which @xmath161 is particularly instructive , since the global density decreases much slower than an exponential . performing the calculations , @xmath162 and",
    "the emerging tree presents a degree distribution @xmath163 up to a cut - off around @xmath42 .",
    "the example shows how easy can be to find processes that generate power - law degree distributions out of exponential networks .",
    "+ the second relevant example concerns epidemic - like spreading phenomena . here",
    "the system of differential equations governing the dynamics is the celebrated susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model @xcite , in which unreached nodes are identified with susceptible nodes , interfacial nodes with infected ones and the bulk nodes correspond to removed individuals .",
    "in analogy with the traceroute dynamics , we can write a system of first - order differential equations governing the temporal evolution of partial densities @xcite .",
    "the fundamental difference between the two dynamics is that in the traceroute model at each time step the algorithm chooses an interfacial node to sample its neighbors , while in the sir model all infected nodes have a fixed probability to spread the virus to their neighbors ( with spreading rate @xmath164 ) .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath164 ( above the percolation threshold ) the topological structure is still tree - like and can be analyzed as in section  [ sec2 ] . when different transmission properties ( e.g. degree - dependent and distance - dependent rates @xmath164 ) are taken into account",
    ", the growing infection region might display very non - trivial topologies . at the same time , the knowledge of the topological structure of an infection s outbreak may be relevant for the design of more appropriate immunization strategies .",
    "+ from a general point of view , the present formalism can be extended to study ( at least numerically ) the effect of degree - degree correlations or quenched disorder , that have not been considered here but play an important role in all real experiments .    in conclusion",
