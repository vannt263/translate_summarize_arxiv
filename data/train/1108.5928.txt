    "in order to extract target measurements , traditional tracking methods apply a detection threshold at every scan . the undesirable effect of detecting the sensor data , however , is that in restricting the data flow , it also throws away potentially useful information . for high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) targets ,",
    "this loss of information is of little concern @xcite . for low snr targets",
    ", this loss of information could be critical for a radar tracking system .",
    "therefore , some new algorithms using unthresholded data are more advantageous than the traditional methods in tracking low snr targets .",
    "the concept of simultaneous detection and tracking using unthresholded data is known in literature as track - before - detect ( tbd ) approach @xcite .",
    "tbd algorithms could improve the performance of a tracking system , which has been investigated for surveillance radar @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite , the advantage of tbd methods",
    "is discussed and many tbd methods are reviewed and compared . as a batch algorithm using the hough transform @xcite , dynamic programming @xcite or maximum likelihood estimation @xcite , tbd could be implemented .",
    "these techniques operate on several data scans and in general require large computational resources @xcite .    as an alternative",
    ", recursive tbd method is based on a recursive single - target bayes filter @xcite .",
    "an extension of the particle filter to multitarget tbd is given in @xcite , and an improved approach is given in @xcite .",
    "in this algorithm , a modeling setup is applied to accommodate the varying number of targets .",
    "then a multiple model sequential monte carlo based tbd approach is used to solve the problem conditioned on the model , i.e. , the number of targets @xcite .",
    "this approach has proven to be very efficient in both single and multitarget case @xcite , though it restricts itself to the case in which the maximum possible number of targets is limited and known .",
    "another extension of the single - target bayes filter to multitarget tbd is based on a multitarget bayes filter . because a single - target bayes filter is optimal for a single target , to solve the problems introduced by multiple targets ,",
    "the multitarget bayes filter is proposed in @xcite . in a multitarget bayes filter ,",
    "multitarget states and observations are modeled as random finite sets ( rfs ) .",
    "this approach is a theoretically optimal approach to multitarget tracking in the framework of finite set statistics ( fisst ) @xcite .",
    "however , the multitarget bayes filter has no practical utility without an approximation strategy . to solve this problem , the probability hypothesis density ( phd ) filter @xcite",
    "is proposed as a tractable and calculation - simple alternative to the multitarget bayes filter @xcite .",
    "the phd is the first moment of the multitarget posterior probability . under some assumptions ( e.g. possion assumption ) ,",
    "the phd is an approximation of the multitarget posterior probability .",
    "therefore , the phd filter can be an approximation of the multitarget bayes filter .",
    "although a phd algorithm for tbd is proposed in @xcite , this approach ignores tbd measurements should be modeled by rfss . in @xcite ,",
    "multitarget tbd from image observations is formulated in a bayesian framework by modeling the collection of states as a multi - bernoulli rfs .",
    "this work use the multi - bernoulli update to develop a high precision multi - object filtering algorithm for image observations , although its adaptability of low snr environment is needed to discussed in more detail .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we use the rfss to model multitarget tbd measurements and the collection of states . in this way , a traditional phd filter @xcite and @xcite",
    "could be applied to multitarget tbd . even though phd could be an approximation of the multitarget posterior probability , the accuracy of the algorithm",
    "is limited by some reasons , which are indicated in this paper .",
    "firstly , when the snr is too low , the phd can not be a sufficient approximation of the multitarget posterior probability because the fundamental assumptions are challenged .",
    "furthermore , for multitarget tbd , the measurements of target and noise can hardly be separated , while the phd filter is heavily dependent on the measurements of targets @xcite . in traditional tracking systems , to solve these problems , cardinalized phd filter ( cphdf ) is proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , cphdf is inefficient in multitarget tbd , because the computational complexity of cphdf is @xmath0 , where is the number of elements of the measurement set and is quite large for the tbd problem .    in this paper , for extending a traditional phd filter to be suitable for multitarget tbd , viewed from a different perspective , tbd can be regarded as a kind of classification problem of target and noise measurements . to enhance the difference between the target and noise measurements and to pursue better classification performance , the measurements need to be denoised .",
    "the threshold shrinkage algorithm @xcite is an important method for image denoising . in general ,",
    "the key points of threshold shrinkage are the following : the method of shrinkage ( e.g. , soft - threshold method ) and the selection criterion of the threshold . in this paper",
    ", a shrinkage operation is adopted that is similar to the threshold shrinkage algorithm .",
    "the optimal parameter for the shrinkage operation can be obtained via certain optimization procedures .",
    "furthermore , in this paper , some problems of multitarget tbd in particle use are also discussed .",
    "the assumption of known snrs is used frequently in traditional tbd algorithms @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "multiple targets with similar snrs are common assumption in the simulations of phd algorithms using the amplitude feature , as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , in practical use , multiple targets with different or unknown snrs are common . in this paper , for the smc implement of the phd filter adopted , this problem could be solved by augmenting the snr into target state , varying the method of generating predicted particles and adjusting the update operator .    in this paper ,",
    "the measurement of targets is modeled by a nail - like model on range - doppler maps because of the assumptions of the classical phd filter in the framework of fisst .",
    "recently , a classical phd filter has been modified to solve the problems of extended and group targets in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "therefore , the tbd measurement model of extended targets in the framework of fisst will be discussed in future work .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the multitarget tbd problem is modeled by rfss . in section 3",
    ", the limitation of traditional phd filter extension to tbd is investigated . in section 4",
    ", a shrinkage option for the phd filter is proposed with an optimal parameter .",
    "tracking multiple targets with different or unknown snrs is discussed in section 5 .",
    "simulation results for the tracking system are presented in section 6 .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section 7 .",
    "the target state is @xmath1^t}$],where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the position and velocity . since there is no ordering on the respective collections of all target states , they can be naturally represented as a finite set .",
    "@xmath4 is the multitarget state - set at time step @xmath5 , i.e. , the set of unknown target states ( which are also of unknown number ) .    in a single - target scenario ,",
    "the state @xmath6 is modeled as random vectors .",
    "then , the multitarget state , including target motion , birth , spawning , can be described by rfs . for target motion ,",
    "given multitarget state set @xmath7 , each @xmath8 either survives at time step @xmath5 with probability @xmath9 , and its transition probability density from @xmath10 to @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the target motion is modeled as the rfs @xmath13 . in the same way , when the rfs of target birth at time @xmath5 is modeled by @xmath14 , and the rfs of targets spawning from a target with @xmath15 is modeled by @xmath16 , the multitarget stat @xmath4 is given by @xmath17\\bigcup { \\left [ { \\bigcup\\limits_{{{\\bf{x}}_{k - 1 } } \\in { x_{k - 1 } } } { { b_{k\\left| { k - 1 } \\right.}}({{\\bf{x}}_{k - 1 } } ) } } \\right]\\bigcup { { \\gamma _ k } } } .\\ ] ]      the measurements are measurements of reflected power as in @xcite",
    "@xmath18 is white complex gaussian noise with variance @xmath19 . in this section , assume that the intensity of all targets is @xmath20 , the snr for the targets is defined by    @xmath21    the method to deal with multiple targets with different or unknown snrs is discussed in section 5 .",
    "because of the assumptions made in the modeling process and the essential difference between an rfs and a random vector , the two conditions that should be satisfied to model tbd measurements by a rfs are the following : there is no target that generates more than one measurement vector , and no measurement vector is generated by more than one target@xcite .",
    "in summary , the measurement of targets should be modeled by a nail - like model on the range - doppler - bearing maps ( the @xmath22 cell is defined by coordinat ( @xmath23 ) ) as follow :    r , d and b are the size of a range , the doppler and the bearing cell .",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "then the measurement model is @xmath30    @xmath31    this means the measurement of a target is like a nail on the range - doppler - bearing maps .",
    "this nail - like model is similar to the point target model in @xcite and @xcite . at step",
    "k , the measurement provided by the sensor consists of @xmath32 measurements @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the number of range , doppler and bearing cells .    the number of @xmath33 is a constant @xmath37 .",
    "however , the number of element of an rfs should be random and poisson distributed for a phd filter . because weak signal information should be preserved by tbd algorithms",
    ", we should make sure all measurements produced by targets are included in the rfs .",
    "therefore , a threshold could be chosen as follows : @xmath38 where the likelihood function for the target is @xmath39 and that for noise is @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the zero order bessel function and @xmath33 is assumed positive.the @xmath42 is the probability detection . because this algorithm is for tbd , it should be ensured that @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is the observation - set consisting of all measurements collected by all sensors at time - step @xmath5 , no matter the measurement from the targets or from the noise . if @xmath45 , let @xmath46 .",
    "then , the measurement rfs @xmath44 is constructed by a subset of the @xmath33 using a thresholding mechanism .",
    "the threshold can insure that @xmath43 by ( [ eq-5 ] ) .",
    "the threshold is a function of the snr of the targets .",
    "the element in the rfs @xmath44 is as follows : @xmath47^t}\\ ] ]    and the likelihood function according @xmath48    @xmath49    at the same time , the sensor could be modeled by @xmath50 } , { \\bf{z}}_k^ * \\in { z_k}\\ ] ] where the measurements of targets are modeled by rfs @xmath51 and the noise is modeled as rfs @xmath52 .",
    "the elements in @xmath53 are the measurements produced by the targets .",
    "the elements in @xmath52 are the measurements which are produced by the noise and bigger than @xmath54 as well .",
    "it is shown that when the measurements of tbd are modeled by rfss , multitarget tbd can be regarded as a kind of classification problem of target and noise measurements for one scan .",
    "this classification problem will be further analyzed in section 4 .",
    "after multitarget tbd measurements and the collection of states are modeled by rfs , a traditional phd filter is applied to multitarget tbd .",
    "this algorithm is reviewed in 3.1 .",
    "however , the accuracy of the algorithm is limited by some reasons when the snr is low , which is discussed in section 3.2 .      as proposed in @xcite , the phd prediction and update equations",
    "are presented as follows :    @xmath55    @xmath56{d_{k\\left| { k{\\rm { - 1 } } } \\right.}}({\\bf{x } } ) + \\sum\\limits_{{z_k } \\in { z_k}}^ { } { \\frac{{{p_d}({\\bf{x}}){g_k}({{\\bf{z}}_k}\\left| { \\bf{x } } \\right.){d_{k\\left| { k{\\rm { - 1 } } } \\right.}}({\\bf{x}})}}{{{\\kappa _ k}({{\\bf{z}}_k } ) + \\int { { p_d}(\\zeta ) { g_k}({{\\bf{z}}_k}\\left| \\zeta   \\right.){d_{k\\left| { k{\\rm { - 1 } } }",

    "@xmath65 is the time - sequence of observation - sets .",
    "because the phd propagation equations involve multiple integrals that have no computationally tractable closed form expressions , sequential monte carlo ( smc ) methods are used to approximate the phd in @xcite .",
    "let the update phd at @xmath66 step @xmath67 be represented by a set of particles @xmath68 , as    @xmath69    the predicted particles are generated by    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are proposal density .",
    "the predicted density is    @xmath73    where    @xmath74    set @xmath75 , the update density will be    @xmath76    where    @xmath77    according to the standard treatment of particle filter , resample @xmath78 to get @xmath79      because @xmath80 can be presented by the number of noise samples @xmath81 multiplying the clutter probability density , the update operator ( [ eq - b5 ] ) turns into    @xmath82    @xmath83    equation ( [ eq-12 ] ) is the likelihood function for the measurement of noise in the measurements set , which denotes the clutter probability density in theoretical filtering ( @xcite and @xcite ) , and the optimal choice of @xmath84 should be the variance of noise , as shown in ( [ eq-11 ] ) .",
    "however , for tbd applications , the snr is extremely low .",
    "hence , this setting of leads to the situation in which measurements generated by the target and noise are not separated correctly and heavy degradation of tracking performance is seen .",
    "in fact , the derivation of ( [ eq-11 ] ) depends on the hypothesis that the number of noise sample is poisson distributed .",
    "this means the clutter follows a poisson distribution and is independent of target - originated measurements . in this way",
    ", the phd can be the `` best fit '' approximations of the multitarget posterior probability @xcite .",
    "the average number of noise samples included in rfs is    @xmath85    when @xmath37 is large and @xmath86 is relatively small , the poisson distribution could be approximated by the distribution of a number of noise samples .",

    "as discussed in the following section , this selection can be considered as a shrinkage operation , and the optimal parameter for the shrinkage operation can be obtained via certain optimization procedures .",
    "to determine the `` optimal '' and make the noise and targets distinguishable , a different perspective should be taken .",
    "as referred to in section 2.2 , tbd can be regarded as a kind of classification problem for target and noise measurements . in other words ,",
    "when a measurement is obtained , should it be classified into a target class or a noise class ? to solve this problem , the fisher class separability criterion , as a supplement of to the traditional bayesian framework , was adopted in our design for the extension of the phd filter .",
    "furthermore , to enhance the difference between the target and noise measurements and pursue the better performance of classification , some attempts to reduce the noise are needed .",
    "the threshold shrinkage algorithm @xcite is an important method for the image denoising . in general , the cores of threshold shrinkage are as follows : the method of shrinkage and the selection criterion of the threshold . a shrinkage operation is adopted in this section that is similar to the threshold shrinkage algorithm to some extent .",
    "the optimal parameter for the shrinkage operation , which acts as the threshold , can be obtained via certain optimization procedures .",
    "the phd filter with the shrinkage operation is called the shrinkage - phd filter .",
    "it is known that the bayesian classifier is the optimal classifier when the posterior probability can be calculated . however , as indicated in section 3.2 , the phd can not be a sufficient approximation of multitarget posterior probability when the snr of the targets is low . therefore , another classification criterion , the fisher class separability criterion , is introduced into our methods .",
    "the separation between the two classes of objects defined by fisher is the ratio of the distance between the centers of classes to the scattering of the classes @xcite :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 represents the centers of classes and @xmath91 denotes the scattering of the classes . in our analysis",
    ", they are set to the mean and variance of the likelihood functions of the target and the noise , respectively .    for targets , the mean and variance",
    "are defined as follows :    @xmath92    @xmath93    for the noise , the mean and variance are given by    @xmath94    @xmath95    therefore , the fisher class separability is    @xmath96    simulations indicated that the correlation between @xmath97 and the snr of the targets is a positive , approximately linear relationship ( as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , when the snr is low , the fisher class separability is so small that the targets and false alarms could not be distinguished . in other words",
    ", we should enlarge the fisher class separability of the target class and the noise class when the snr of the targets is low .          to enlarge the fisher class separability between targets and noise ,",
    "some kind of `` shrinkage '' operation is applied to the likelihood function of the noise .",
    "that is , the parameter @xmath19 in ( [ eq-17 ] ) and ( [ eq-18 ] ) is adjusted .",
    "if @xmath98 is chosen instead of @xmath19 itself , then fisher class separability becomes    @xmath99    obviously , @xmath100 is larger than @xmath97 whenever @xmath98 .",
    "the following question naturally arises : how does one choose the `` optimal '' @xmath101 , which is the key parameter for the shrinkage process ?      to demonstrate how influences the classification problem of target and noise measurements , we can define the mahalanobis distance @xcite of measurement @xmath102 using the center of the noise class and the target class , respectively :    @xmath103    and    @xmath104    because the selection of the threshold is a difficult task for the threshold shrinkage algorithm @xcite in the field of image denoising , the selection of the optimal parameter for the shrinkage - phd filter involves similar problems . for the threshold shrinkage algorithm , an oversized threshold may result in the loss of signal .",
    "in contrast , too much noise may remain if an undersized threshold is used . in the same way , for the shrinkage - phd filter , preserving the weak target information and reducing the noise by tracking are the major challenges to be addressed for tbd problems .",
    "therefore , when considering the two sides , the selection criterion should be designed as follows :    @xmath105    the first constraint represents the `` shrinkage '' . to preserve the weak target information and classify as many low snr targets to the target class as possible",
    ", the mahalanobis distance of measurement with the center of noise class should be enhanced ; hence , the variance of the noise class should be reduced .",
    "the second constraint refers to the fixed probability of target loss .",
    "the reason for this term is that for tbd problems , false alarms can be reduced by integration over time .",
    "meanwhile , if target loss occurred , the integration of the information of targets is broken off .",
    "hence , the cost of target loss is much larger than the cost of false alarms , which is the main difference between tbd and common radar detection .",
    "moreover , for the phd filter , a missed detection can result in loss of the track @xcite .",
    "therefore , target loss should be fixed as @xmath106 .",
    "when the @xmath106 is set , a critical value @xmath107 is determined .",
    "the third constraint means that the measurements @xmath102 determined by the second constraint should be classified as targets .",
    "when the snr is low , @xmath108 always intersects @xmath109 , so the optimal solution @xmath110 to ( [ eq-23 ] ) is deduced , as indicated in fig.[fig:2](a ) . with the increasing snr",
    ", @xmath108 becomes much larger than @xmath109 and thus we choose @xmath111 , as shown in fig.[fig:2](b ) .",

    "to minimize the influence of shrinkage on the classification of the noise measurement , the maximum @xmath112 , which is consistent with the above constraints , is obtained .",
    "the optimal solutions to ( [ eq-23 ] ) under different snrs are listed in table 2 :    lllll snr(db ) & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 + @xmath113 & @xmath114 & @xmath115 & @xmath116 & @xmath117 + snr(db ) & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 + @xmath113 & @xmath118 & @xmath119 & @xmath120 & @xmath88 +    the update operator of the shrinkage - phd filter can be summarized as follows :    @xmath121    where @xmath113 should be set according to table 2 .",
    "this section is to solve of the problem of tracking multiple targets with different or unknown snrs .    as proposed in section 4 , the optimal parameter for the shrinkage operation",

    "spawns form the first one , and the velocity in the x - direction is -300 m/s . the third target new - birth far from the previous two targets at the time step 13 with the intital target state @xmath164^t}$ ]",
    "a comparison of the estimation errors of the position and the velocity of the three algorithms is shown in fig .",
    "10 and 11 . in this scene ,",
    "the targets vary not only the value of snrs but also the average number of targets .",
    "because the snr of the first target is lower than which in section 6.2 , the convergence velocity of the estimation first target is slower .",
    "after time step 7 , comparing figs . 6 and 10 , fig.7 and 11 , the varying snrs and the number of the targets did not significantly influence the performance of the phdf and shrinkage - phdf .",
    "in this example , the performance of mpf is better than that in the first example .",
    "the reason is the intensity of the targets is the most important characteristic to differentiate different targets for mpf method . in this way",
    ", the snrs of all targets should be known for mpf method .              the phd filter and the shrinkage - phd filter",
    "are compared in fig .",
    "12 and 13 .",
    "the sense is similar with that in the section 6.2 , but the snrs of the targets are unknown and the snr of the second target changes from 9db to 10db .",
    "it is obvious that the performance of both algorithms is similar to what was presented in figs .",
    "6 and 7 . after the 11th time step",
    ", the performance is even better than which in the section 6.2 , because the value of the snr of the second target is increased .",
    "therefore , whether the snrs of multiple targets are known has not significant influence on the performance of phdf and shrinkage - phdf .",
    "in addition , mpf from @xcite does not work when the value of the snrs of the targets are unknown .",
    "llll algorithm & shrinkage - phdf & phdf & mpf + computation(second ) & 28.66 & 28.12 & 84.20 +    table 3 shows the computation resources needed for the phdf , the shrinkage - phdf and mpf .",
    "all simulations were run on a pc with an intel ( r ) core tm2 duo cpu e4500 @ 2.20 ghz processor .",
    "the time listed is monte carlo - averaged , for a run in a scenario similar to that given in section 6.2 .",
    "the amount of calculation time required for the shrinkage - phdf and the phdf is much less than for mpf .",
    "the calculated amount time required for the shrinkage - phdf is slightly greater than that required for the phd filter .",
    "in this paper , we used the rfs to model multitarget tbd measurements and to design an efficient shrinkage - phd filter for multitarget tbd .",
    "this filter accompanies with a shrinkage operation , and the optimal parameter for the shrinkage operation is obtained by an optimization procedure .",
    "simulations show that the shrinkage - phd filter takes very little time to detect new targets , and it is sensitive to the variation in the number of targets . moreover , our algorithm can track targets with high accuracy by taking advantage of the shrinkage operation .",
    "in addition , there is no restriction on the maximum number of possible targets or known value of snrs of targets . in a word , by the application of shrinkage - phd filter",
    ", multiple targets could be tracked well in low snr environments .    in the future research ,",
    "a challenge to be explored for the shrinkage - phd filter will be determining how to model the measurement of extended targets in the framework of fisst . if this issue is resolved , it is believed that our new approach will be useful in future radar systems using the tbd technique .",
