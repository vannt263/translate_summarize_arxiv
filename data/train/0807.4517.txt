    "however , while previous results were obtained for no - slip boundary conditions , we obtain exact analytical results using boundary conditions which allow the sphere to slide with respect to the polymer network .",
    "our boundary conditions encompass both the no - slip and frictionless sliding limits with respect to the polymer network .",
    "although norris  @xcite and oestreicher  @xcite have previously obtained analytic solutions for the response function of a sphere in a material with a single complex shear modulus for both no - slip and frictionless sliding boundary conditions , a crucial feature of the two - fluid model is that the boundary conditions for the fluid and the network can be different .",
    "this feature opens up the possibility that the far - field behavior can reflect either the fluid or the network boundary conditions , depending on the frequency of motion .",

    "as emphasized earlier , the solvent and network move together except in the boundary layers near the plates .",
    "the plates exert no direct force on the network , so any shear on the network results from the motion of the solvent dragging the network along in the boundary layer , and any stress from network shear in the interior is ultimately supported by the traction of the solvent at the plate .",
