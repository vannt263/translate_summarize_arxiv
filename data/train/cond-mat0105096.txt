    "low - dimensional quantum - magnetism has received considerable interest recently due to the discovery of numerous novel materials with spin-@xmath0 moments arranged in chain , ladder , and depleted planar structures .",
    "many of these materials exhibit unconventional magnetic phases due to dimerization and frustration of antiferromagnetic exchange .",
    "particular effort@xcite has been devoted to systems like srcu@xmath1(bo@xmath2)@xmath1@xcite , which display a complete frustration of the magnetic exchange as in the two - dimensional shastry - sutherland model@xcite . in one dimension complete frustration",
    "can occur in two - leg spin - ladders if an additional cross - wise exchange is included as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] which resembles a chain of edge sharing tetrahedra . for @xmath3",
    "such tetrahedral ladders have been investigated in the past@xcite .",
    "very recently , tellurates of type cu@xmath1te@xmath1o@xmath4x@xmath1 with x = cl , br have been identified as a new class of spin-1/2 tetrahedral - cluster compounds@xcite .",
    "bulk thermodynamic data have been analyzed in the limit of isolated tetrahedra@xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy , however indicates a substantial inter - tetrahedral coupling along the c - axis direction of cu@xmath1te@xmath1o@xmath4x@xmath1@xcite . in this direction",
    "the exchange topology is likely to be analogous to that of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with @xmath5 . from a materials perspective",
    "it is an open question if the magnetism of the tellurates can be understood in terms of a dimerized tetrahedral spin - ladder . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", however , the magnetic properties of this model are an interesting issue which forms the motivation for this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss the basic properties of the tetrahedral chain hamiltonian . in section two",
    "the quantum phase diagram is analyzed . in section three a bond - operator method",
    "is applied to the tetrahedral chain and in section four the magnetic raman cross - section is evaluated .",
    "the hamiltonian of the tetrahedral chain can be written in terms of the total edge - spin operators @xmath6 and the dimensionless couplings @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9   \\label{bb1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this model displays infinitely many local conservation laws : @xmath10=0;\\,\\forall\\,l , i=1,2 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the hilbert space decomposes into sectors of fixed distributions of edge - spin eigenvalues @xmath11 or @xmath12 , each corresponding to a sequences of spin-1 chain - segments intermitted by chain - segments of _ localized _ singlets . if @xmath5 the spin-1 chain - segments are dimerized . in the infinite length ,",
    "dimerized @xmath13-chain sector , i.e.  for @xmath11 @xmath14 , the model simplifies to @xmath15 + \\frac{a}{2}d   \\label{w3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 refer to spin-1 operators and @xmath17 is the number of tetrahedra ( dimers ) .",
    "we have checked @xmath20 to increase monotonously with @xmath21 by evaluating the ground - state energy per site of a dimerized @xmath13 chain with _",
    "open _ boundary conditions as a function of system size .                                        in principle",
    "two - particle irreducible vertices can be constructed to second order in @xmath23 from @xmath24 . in the singlet channel , however , because of the symmetries of the spin indices in ( [ wr3 ] ) w.r.t .",
    "those of the levi - civita symbol in @xmath24 these vanish identically .    using a different technique",
    "an expression very similar to the denominator of ( [ wr11 ] ) has been obtained in a study of phonon - assisted optical two - triplet - absorption on _ spin-@xmath25 two - leg ladders_@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the dimerized @xmath13 chain case , however , @xmath26 has been found for the ladder in that case . in that work",
    "it was predicted , that the singlet bound - state of the ladder should be observable in optical absorbtion .",
    "recent work has confirmed this prediction@xcite ."
