    "it is speculated that the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is a strongly coupled liquid @xcite . because of strong coupling or rather strong interactions , the qgp fluid has a very small viscosity .",
    "however , questions regarding the source of the strong coupling and its needed strength to generate a quasi - ideal fluid remain unanswered .",
    "the necessary condition for the onset of perfect hydrodynamical expansion is the achievement of local kinetic equilibrium .",
    "although the quarks and gluons produced at rhic are far from thermal equilibrium , kinetic equilibration should occur on a short time scale so that the elliptic flow , @xmath4 , increases substantially @xcite . in this article",
    "we assume that the strong coupling and thermalization are a consequence of frequent collisions among gluons on a semi - classical level .",
    "we recently developed a new on - shell parton cascade code , bamps ( boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings ) @xcite , which is a microscopical relativistic transport model that solves the boltzmann equation for partons that are produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the included interactions can be elastic @xmath0 processes or inelastic @xmath1 pqcd bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "although the total perturbative quantum chromodynamics- ( pqcd ) scattering cross section is only a few mb , it is enough to drive the system toward full thermal equilibrium @xcite and also to generate sufficiently large elliptic flow @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "our goal is to understand the theoretical mechanism for the fast equilibration of gluons , which are observed numerically .    in kinetic theory",
    "there are two competing processes that affect kinetic equilibration .",
    "the first is when particles stream freely between two subsequent collisions . in an expanding system",
    "free streaming drives the system out of equilibrium .",
    "this is the case in a one - dimensional bjorken expansion , which most likely occurs early on in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the second one involves collisions that make the particle momentum kinetically isotropic and thermal .",
    "here one has to take into account the distribution of collision angle because large - angle collisions should contribute more to momentum isotropization .",
    "we define isotropization as the development of an anisotropic system as it reaches isotropy .",
    "a _ transport cross section _",
    "@xcite was introduced , either in the form @xmath5 or @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the collision angle as a pertinent quantity that measures the contributions of various collision processes to kinetic equilibration .",
    "although kinetic equilibration is observed locally in the comoving frame of the expanding system , the transport cross section is usually calculated in the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame of individual colliding particles .",
    "the changes in momenta after the collision appears different in each respective frame .",
    "therefore , the transport cross section may not be fully appropriate for characterizing kinetic equilibration .",
    "a widely used , yet simpler , method to characterize kinetic equilibration is to calculate or estimate the relaxation time @xmath8 @xcite . in the relaxation time approximation the collision term is expressed by @xmath9 , where @xmath8 is assumed to be momentum independent and is then a global quantity that characterizes the kinetic equilibration time scale .",
    "however , the validity of the approximation must be verified .    in this article",
    "we derive a mathematical method of quantifying the contributions of various processes to the momentum isotropization . for this",
    "we define the _ transport rate _ , which is the momentum average of the particle density @xmath10 . the particle density is found within the parton cascade as a solution of the boltzmann equation .",

    "[ sec:3 ] for a central au+au collision at rhic ( @xmath11 gev ) .",
    "the inclusion of quarks into the parton cascade is straightforward and the results will be presented in another article . in sec .",

    "we present in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] the numerical results on the transport rates .",
    "the transport rate of gluon drift is computed and compared with the one when obtained assuming bjorken boost invariance . to show the importance of the bremsstrahlung processes in thermal equilibration , we carry out simulations with and without these processes for comparison . the quantitative difference in the momentum isotropization for both simulations",
    "is manifested by the ratio of the total transport rates .",
    "the ratio , which turns out to be approximately 6 , is used to perform a third type of simulation in which only elastic scatterings with artificially enlarged cross sections are included .",
    "although such large cross sections are not physical , they verify our main finding : the total transport collision rate is the key quantity determining momentum isotropization . despite the process type",
    "as long as the total transport collision rate is the same , the momentum isotropization is also the same . at the end of sec .",

    ", the debye screening mass should depend on the direction of the gluon propagator @xcite .",
    "if the gluon distribution @xmath32 significantly deviates from its isotropic shape , the debye screening mass may even become negative , which leads to instabilities in certain modes of the soft gauge field @xcite .",
    "these instabilities and their proper inclusion are beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "we have simplified the problem by removing the directional dependence of the debye screening mass .    the suppression of the radiation of soft gluons due to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite is included using the step function in eq .",
    "( [ m23 ] ) . there",
    "the time of the emission , @xmath33 , should be smaller than the time interval between two scatterings or equivalently the gluon mean free path @xmath28 .",
    "this leads to a lower cutoff for @xmath34 and a decrease in the total cross section or the transition probability .",
    "compared to the default setup in ref .",
    "@xcite , further improvements have been made . to calculate the debye screening mass @xmath29 in a local region more accurately ,",
    "we make use of the polar symmetry in central collisions and divide the transverse plane in each @xmath15-bin into rings : the first ring has a radial size of @xmath35 fm ( @xmath36 being the transverse radius ) , and the following rings have transverse radial widths of @xmath37 fm .",
    "the rings are regarded as local regions in which the debye screening mass is evaluated .",
    "the local collision rates of all interaction channels , the sum of which is the inverse of the mean free path that models the lpm effect , were evaluated in ref .",

    "this leads to large fluctuations in the mean free path in cells with few ( test ) particles . to reduce these fluctuations",
    "we take the averaged value of the collision rates over all the cells within individual rings .",
    "in addition , transverse velocities of rings are taken into account to calculate the collision rates in the comoving frames .",
    "moreover , we assume that if the energy density , which is calculated locally in the comoving frame , sinks below @xmath38 , particles in that region no longer interact , so they propagate freely . at this stage",
    "a hadronization procedure should be applied , which is planned as a future project .",
    "we concentrate on the central region of the full reaction , which is defined as a cylinder with @xmath35 fm and @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the space - time rapidity @xmath41 .",
    "the longitudinal extension of the cylinder is , thus , @xmath42 .",
    "the parameters for bounding the cylinder are found by balancing between having a small , local region and avoiding high statistical fluctuations .",
    "results in this region are obtained by averaging over the various ensembles .",
    "initial gluons are taken as an ensemble of minijets with transverse momentum greater than @xmath43 gev , which are produced via semihard nucleon - nucleon collisions @xcite .",
    "details of the distribution of the initial gluons in space and time can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . using glauber - geometry and assuming independent binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , the gluon number is initially about @xmath44 per momentum rapidity .",
    "these gluons take about @xmath45 of the total given energy entered in a central au+au collision .",
    "the lower momentum cutoff is taken as a parameter to fit the experimentally measured final transverse energy at midrapidity ( see fig . [ et ] ) .    for simplicity s sake",
    "one may assume that the two gold nuclei are extremely lorentz contracted with zero width .",
    "assuming that on - shell gluons are immediately formed ( i.e. , without any formation time ) at the same time when the corresponding nucleon - nucleon collision occurs , all initial gluons are positioned at @xmath46 fm at @xmath47 fm / c .",
    "subsequent free streaming would immediately order the gluons with the momentum rapidity @xmath27 to a spatial slice with the space - time rapidity @xmath40 being equal to @xmath27 . in the comoving frame of each spatial slice gluon momentum",
    "has only a transverse component and it has a highly anisotropic distribution .",
    "at rhic energy each of the colliding gold nuclei has a small but nonvanishing longitudinal extension of about @xmath48 fm .",
    "therefore , gluons are primarily produced at @xmath46 fm ( or @xmath49 ) at @xmath50 fm / c when the two nuclei overlap fully .",
    "note that @xmath47 fm / c is when two nuclei are just touching .",
    "in contrast to the simplified case mentioned above in reality there is a significant smearing in the gluonic @xmath51 correlation for times @xmath52 fm / c .",
    "for instance , gluons with @xmath53 will also appear in the central slice with @xmath49 for a while .",
    "the rate of smearing disappearance is shown in fig .",
    "[ initdistpxz ] , where the spectra of transverse and longitudinal gluon momenta are depicted during initial free streaming in absence of secondary collisions .",
    "the spectra are obtained in the central region ( @xmath35 fm and @xmath39 ) .",
    "we see that the @xmath54 spectrum changes quite drastically after @xmath48 fm / c , the same point when two gold nuclei cease to overlap and the production of minijets is completed .",
    "the free streaming of high @xmath54 gluons away from the central region leads to strong , continuous suppression in the @xmath54 spectrum .",
    "corresponding to this suppression , the changes in the @xmath55 spectrum at low transverse momentum are , however , tiny compared with their absolute values at low @xmath55 . at high @xmath55 the change in time is negligable because there is no initial transverse expansion for large nuclei .",
    "therefore , in fig . [ initdistpxz ]",
    "the @xmath55 spectrum is depicted only at @xmath56 fm / c .",
    "we note that at large @xmath54 the suppression stops completely when all the particles with high @xmath57 ( or with high @xmath58 ) have left the small , but finite , rapidity window @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "then , only particles with lower rapidity @xmath27 remain in the central region . the time a gluon needs to leave the central region is , for instance , @xmath60 when the gluon is produced at @xmath61 fm at @xmath62 .",
    "we see that the larger the momentum rapidity @xmath27 , the smaller @xmath63 . for a gluon with @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath65 fm / c it takes @xmath66 fm / c to leave the central region .    comparing the particle spectrum of @xmath54 with that of @xmath55 ,",
    "the momentum distribution is , strictly speaking , at no time isotropic during the initial free streaming .",
    "the characteristic hump in the @xmath55 spectrum at @xmath43 gev arises from the requirement that the transverse momentum of the original minijets should be greater than @xmath43 gev .",
    "choosing other initial conditions like in hijing @xcite or the color glass condensate @xcite would change the shape of the initial momentum distribution . however , even though the momentum distribution might be isotropic during the continuing suppression of high @xmath54 gluons , the further suppression leads to a deviation in the momentum distribution away from isotropy within a very short time of @xmath67 fm / c .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that free streaming leads to @xmath68 regardless of the initial @xmath51 correlation .",
    "the gluon momentum distribution after short - time free streaming is , in general , neither thermal nor isotropic .    in this article",
    "we introduce an additional _ formation time _",
    "@xcite for every minijet , @xmath69 , which models the prior off - shell propagation of the gluons to be freed in individual nucleon - nucleon collisions , where @xmath70 denotes the lorentz factor . within @xmath71",
    "we assume that the virtual gluon does not interact and , therefore , moves freely at the speed of light . gluons with large @xmath54 have in turn a large lorentz factor and , thus , a large formation time .",
    "although most of these gluons are produced in the central region , they are far from the central region when they materialize as on - shell partons because of the assumed off - shell propagation . because we count particles",
    "only if they are on - shell , i.e. , interactive , the initial gluon momentum distribution at @xmath48 fm / c differs from that shown in fig .",
    "[ initdistpxz ] . however , it is practically identical to that at @xmath72 fm / c , which is not isotropic .",
    "when the initial conditions are chosen accordingly and a simulation including the pqcd bremsstrahlung processes is performed , we obtain @xmath73 gev at midrapidity with a final time of @xmath74 fm / c , at which the energy density of gluons decreases to the critical value of @xmath37 gev/@xmath75 .",
    "our @xmath76 at @xmath77 from the simulation is comparable with that found in experimental measurements at rhic @xcite ( see fig .",
    "kinetic equilibration is a process in which the particle momentum becomes isotropic and thermal , which has an exponential distribution .",
    "momentum isotropization is part of kinetic equilibration and is reached before full kinetic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "( strictly speaking , full kinetic equilibrium can be achieved only for a static , nonexpanding system . ) in this article we concentrate on the contribution of collision processes to momentum isotropization and kinetic equilibration of gluon matter in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .    as demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , the initial free streaming ( or the off - shell propagation ) of gluons with high momentum rapidity @xmath27 makes the momentum distribution anisotropic , even if it appears momentarily isotropic .",
    "initially in the central region most gluons move in the transverse direction .",
    "secondary collision processes gradually force them into the longitudinal direction , which gives a positive contribution to momentum isotropization .",
    "however , whenever a gluon switches to the longitudinal direction , its momentum rapidity grows and the gluon tends to drift out of the central region .",
    "this gives a negative contribution to momentum isotropization in the local region .",
    "although gluons with the same ( regardless of @xmath78 sign ) momentum rapidity drift from their neighboring slices into the central slice , this can not completely compensate for the loss in the central region .",
    "the reason is that thermalization occurs earlier in the central slice than in the outwards regions corresponding to bjorken s picture of boost - invariance in the space - time evolution of the parton system @xcite . in the transverse direction",
    ", however , there is no transverse flow at the beginning of the expansion .",
    "therefore , no net drift of gluons occurs in the transverse direction .",
    "the difference in the gluon drift in the longitudinal and transverse directions leads to a situation in which the net effect of the drift has a negative contribution to momentum isotropization and the stronger the momentum isotropization , the larger the negative contribution of the particle drift . at later times ,",
    "when three - dimensional expansion takes place , there is also a net particle drift in the transverse direction and the negative contribution of the particle drift to momentum isotropization decreases .    in this section",
    "we first demonstrate momentum isotropization and kinetic equilibration of gluons in central au+au collisions at rhic energy .",
    "the various contributions of collisions and drift to momentum isotropization will be analysed in detail in the next section .",
    "figure [ distpxz ] depicts the transverse and longitudinal gluon momenta distributions in the central region at four different times throughout the evolution of gluon matter .",
    "the results are obtained when both elastic and inelastic pqcd - based scattering processes are included .",
    "we first see that the momentum distribution continuously isotropizes and thermalizes over time .",
    "due to the expansion full thermal equilibrium can not be achieved if the collision rate is finite .",
    "a certain mismatch in @xmath57 and @xmath79 must exist due to the counteraction between the expansion and the collisions .",
    "second , fig .",
    "[ distpxz ] shows that there is an exponential distribution before the system becomes isotropic .",
    "it is almost impossible to distinguish the gluon momentum isotropy time scale from the thermal time scale .",
    "it seems that when collisions drive the particle momentum close to isotropy , the momentum distribution is already practically thermalized . in general",
    ", momentum isotropization happens on a shorter time scale than kinetic equilibration .",
    "the difference in the time scales of both dynamical processes depends on the initial condition for gluons .",
    "kinetic equilibration for the softer gluons is completed earlier than that for the harder gluons .",
    "this is obvious for elastic @xmath80 scattering processes because the momentum transfer in collisions is typically the debye screening mass .",
    "therefore , the hard gluons can not be deflected as strongly as the soft gluons .",
    "however , in the inelastic pqcd @xmath81 collisions , which we will prove are the dominant processes in kinetic equilibration , the difference in the momentum degradation for soft and hard gluons is miniscule due to the production or absorbtion of an additional gluon . averaging the various kinetic equilibrium times for soft and hard gluons the momentum distribution becomes _ isotropic and thermal at @xmath82 fm / c_. furthermore , we clearly see that the distributions become steeper with time , which indicates the ongoing cooling of the system related to quasihydrodynamical behavior due to the subsequent work done by the expanding system .    to understand the role of the inelastic pqcd @xmath81 processes in kinetic equilibration , we also carry out calculations in which gluons interact only via elastic scatterings .",
    "the initial conditions are the same as those when inelastic collisions are included .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ p22distpxz ] , which has the same structure as fig .",
    "[ distpxz ] .",
    "the difference in the results depicted in both figures can be immediately seen .",
    "the spectra in fig .",
    "[ p22distpxz ] only show a small change throughout the entire evolution of the system and are still highly anisotropic and are not thermalized as late as @xmath83 fm / c .",
    "the evolution resembles that of free streaming .",
    "the kinetic equilibration time strongly depends on whether the pqcd bremsstrahlung processes and their back reactions are taken into account .",
    "the pqcd bremsstrahlung processes and their back reactions isotropize the momentum more efficiently than elastic collisions and , thus , play an essential role in early thermalization of gluons in heavy - ion collisions at rhic . as seen in fig .",
    "[ cross - section ] , the pqcd cross section of @xmath84 processes , including lpm suppression ( dashed curve ) , is _ smaller _ than that of elastic scatterings ( solid curve ) and much smaller than the cross section obtained in the simulation with elastic - only scattering processes ( dotted curve ) .",
    "although particle production in inelastic processes can enhance the number of collision centers and , thus , effectively shorten the mean free path of particles , chemical equilibration will balance the production by the annihilation of particles to avoid oversaturation .",
    "the fact that the cross section of the pqcd bremsstrahlung process is small , but its kinetic equilibration efficiency is large , demonstrates that cross sections or collision rates are not the correct quantities to describe the contributions of various processes to kinetic equilibration .",
    "the collision - angle distribution must be at least taken into account .",
    "defining the correct quantity is one of the main purposes for this article .    in fig .",
    "[ cross - section ] the large difference in the total cross sections of elastic scatterings for various simulations is shown . because @xmath85 the difference in the cross sections arises from the difference in the development of the debye screening mass @xmath29 in the various simulations .",

    "the time dependence of the debye screening mass in a real expansion starting out of thermal equilibrium and undergoing thermalization is more complicated . whereas kinetic equilibration drives the density distribution of gluons to its thermalized shape , which affects the calculation of @xmath29 ( [ md2 ] ) , chemical equilibration , which is not taken into account above , will enhance or reduce the gluon number , which in turn enhances or reduces @xmath29 .",
