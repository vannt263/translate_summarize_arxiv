    "<S> we investigate time - independent disorder on several two - dimensional discrete - time quantum walks . </S>",
    "<S> we find numerically that , contrary to claims in the literature , random onsite phase disorder , spin - dependent or otherwise , can not localise the hadamard quantum walk ; rather , it induces diffusive spreading of the walker . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , split - step quantum walks are generically localised by phase disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we explain this difference by showing that the hadamard walk is a special case of the split - step quantum walk , with parameters tuned to a critical point at a topological phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the topological phase transition can also be reached by introducing strong disorder in the rotation angles . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the critical exponent for the divergence of the localisation length at the topological phase transition , and find @xmath0 , in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> this places the two - dimensional split - step quantum walk in the universality class of the quantum hall effect .    </S>",
    "<S> discrete - time quantum walks@xcite , which we will simply refer to as quantum walks , are the quantum analogues of classical random walks . </S>",
    "<S> they are model systems which sit at the interface between quantum information theory and condensed matter physics . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , they form archetypical systems for studying quantum algorithms@xcite . on the other hand , condensed matter physics </S>",
    "<S> has recently also shown interest in quantum walks @xcite in particular ever since it was shown that the topological phases @xcite can also be realised in quantum walks @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> condensed matter physics has a very wide scope , but one important subject of it is disorder and the associated localisation of single - particle wave functions ( for a review , see ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to understand quantum walks from the condensed matter point of view , we need to address the effect of disorder on the propagation of a quantum walker </S>",
    "<S> .    one of the interesting aspects of quantum walks is that in the absence of disorder the quantum walker propagates ballistically @xcite , thus much faster than its classical counterpart , which shows diffusive propagation . the ballistic spreading of the quantum walk is related to the quantum speed up of certain quantum algorithms , notably grover s search algorithm@xcite , as the quantum walker is able to explore the search space more rapidly than its classical counterpart .    </S>",
    "<S> if disorder is introduced into the quantum walk system , it is expected to break the ballistic propagation of the quantum walk , analogously to the way in which disorder introduced into a solid - state system will affect electrons due to disorder scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this could be of relevance to the quantum information applications of quantum walks , as the quantum speed up of quantum algorithms is intimately related to ballistic propagation .    </S>",
    "<S> although the effects of disorder on one - dimensional quantum walks have been extensively studied , not much is known about the two - dimensional case . for one - dimensional </S>",
    "<S> quantum walks it has been shown that spatial disorder can lead to exponential localisation of all energy eigenstates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was also found , however , that chiral symmetry can prevent localisation in one dimension @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the effects of spatial disorder in two - dimensional quantum walks and its impact on the quantum walk propagation was only studied in ref .   for the hadamard walk . </S>",
    "<S> in that paper it was reported that in the disordered system the wave function remains majoritatively close to the starting position , unlike in the clean case , where the amplitude of the wavefunction at the initial site decreases to zero in the long time limit . </S>",
    "<S> this concentration of the wave function close to its initial position ( which is according to a looser terminology used as the definition of localisation , as , e.g , in ref .  ) </S>",
    "<S> was attributed to anderson localisation .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we study of the effects of spatial disorder on the propagation and localisation of the hadamard walk , and on the broader family of two - dimensional split - step walks to which it belongs . </S>",
    "<S> sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : defin - quant - walks ] collects the definitions of these walks , recalls their connection and their topological phases . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : phase_disorder ] we show that phase disorder localises generic split - step walks , but not the hadamard walk : this latter shows slow diffusion ( contrary to the findings of ref .  ) . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : topological_transition ] we attribute this difference to the fact that the hadamard walk is critical : it is a split - step walk that is tuned to a topological phase transition point . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this phase transition and calculate the corresponding critical exponent , @xmath0 , which places the split - step walk in the quantum hall universality class . finally , in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : disorder_angle ] we study disorder in the angle parameters of the split - step walks . </S>",
    "<S> based on the preceding section , one can expect that if the angle disorder is large enough , the split - step walk can become diffusive even with maximal phase disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this disorder - induced delocalisation actually takes place , and find for it the same critical exponent @xmath1 as in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : topological_transition ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that angle disorder alone leads to diffusion rather than localisation , which is probably connected to the presence of a particle - hole symmetry in this disordered quantum walk . </S>"
