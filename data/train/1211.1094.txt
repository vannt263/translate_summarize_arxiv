    "the fact that the distribution of @xmath5 is invariant under the permutations of the coordinates of @xmath6 is called the symmetry between sites , which is what one usually understands by a mean field model .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ skh ] ) is a gaussian process with the covariance @xmath7 that depends on the spin configurations @xmath8 only through their normalized scalar product @xmath9 called the overlap of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . since the distribution of a gaussian process",
    "is determined by its covariance , it is not surprising that the overlaps play a central role in the analysis of the model .",
    "one can also consider a generalization of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , the so - called mixed @xmath12-spin model , which corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath13 given by a linear combination of pure @xmath12-spin hamiltonians @xmath14 where the random variables @xmath15 are standard gaussian , independent for all @xmath16 and all @xmath17 . similarly to ( [ cov ] ) , it is easy to check that the covariance is , again , a function of the overlap , @xmath18 one usually assumes that the coefficients @xmath19 decrease fast enough to ensure that the process is well defined when the sum in ( [ mixedh ] ) includes infinitely many terms .",

    "this way we can group equal replicas and then use the law of large numbers to estimate their gibbs weights from the frequencies of their appearance in the sample .",
    "since the gram matrix describes relative position of points in the euclidean space up to orthogonal transformations , the overlap matrix @xmath64 can be used to encode the information about the gibbs measure @xmath61 up to orthogonal transformations . for this reason ( and some other reasons that will be mentioned below ) , the gibbs measure in the sherrington - kirkpatrick and mixed @xmath12-spin models",
    "is often identified with the distribution of the overlap matrix @xmath64 .",
    "since the overlaps are bounded in absolute value by @xmath37 , this allows us to pass to the infinite - volume limit and consider a set of all possible limiting distributions of @xmath64 over subsequences .",

    "we will call such measure @xmath71 an asymptotic gibbs measure and think of it as a limit of the gibbs measures @xmath61 over some subsequence , where the convergence is defined by way of the overlap arrays , as above . the reason why the diagonal elements are not included in ( [ ch12rds ] ) is because in ( [ ch12overlaps ] ) they were equal to @xmath37 by construction , while the asymptotic gibbs measure is not necessarily concentrated on the unit sphere .",
    "this mathematical definition of an asymptotic gibbs measure via the dovbysh - sudakov representation was first given by arguin and aizenman in @xcite .",

    "the fact that the infimum in ( [ ch30parisi ] ) is taken over discrete distributions @xmath28 is not critical , since the definition of the parisi functional @xmath77 can be extended to all distributions on @xmath29 $ ] by continuity .",
    "another important idea introduced in @xcite was the decomposition of the gibbs measure into pure states .",
    "this simply means that an asymptotic gibbs measure @xmath71 is concentrated on countably many points @xmath78 in the hilbert space @xmath72 , and these are precisely the pure states .",
    "it was also suggested in @xcite that it is reasonable to assume that all the pure states have equal norm , so the asymptotic gibbs measure @xmath71 is concentrated on some non - random sphere , @xmath79 .",
    "this implies , for example , that the largest value the overlap can take is @xmath80 when the replicas @xmath81 for some @xmath82 and , since this can happen with positive probability , the distribution of the overlap has an atom at the largest point of its support , @xmath83 .",
    "we will see below that , due to some stability properties of the gibbs measure , the pure state picture is correct if the distribution of the overlap has an atom at the largest point @xmath84 of its support , otherwise , the measure @xmath71 is non - atomic , but is still concentrated on the sphere @xmath85 .    [ [ ultrametricity . ] ] ultrametricity .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    perhaps , the most famous feature of the parisi solution of the sk model in @xcite , @xcite , was the choice of an ultrametric parametrization of the replica matrix in the replica method , and in the work of mzard , parisi , sourlas , toulouse and virasoro @xcite , @xcite , this was interpreted as the ultrametricity of the support of the asymptotic gibbs measure @xmath71 in @xmath72 , which means that the distances between any three points in the support satisfy the strong triangle , or ultrametric , inequality @xmath86 when the gibbs measure is concentrated on the sphere @xmath85 , we can express the distance in terms of the overlap , @xmath87 , and , therefore , the ultrametricity can also be expressed in terms of the overlaps , @xmath88 one can think about ultrametricity as clustering of the support of @xmath71 , because the ultrametric inequality ( [ ultra1 ] ) implies that the relation defined by the condition @xmath89 is an equivalence relation on the support of @xmath71 for any @xmath90 .",
    "as we increase @xmath91 , smaller clusters will collapse into bigger clusters and the whole process can be visualized by a branching tree . for a given diameter",
    "@xmath92 one can consider the equivalence clusters and study the joint distribution of their gibbs weights .",
    "in the case when @xmath93 , which corresponds to the weights of the pure states @xmath94 , this distribution was characterized in @xcite using the replica method , but the same computation works for any @xmath90 .",
    "more generally , one can consider several cluster sizes @xmath95 and for each pure state @xmath96 consider the weights of the clusters it belongs to , @xmath97 again , using the replica method within the parisi ansatz , one can study the joint distribution of all these weights for all pure states , but the computation gets very complicated and not particularly illuminating .",
    "on the other hand , the problem of understanding the distribution of the cluster weights is very important , since this gives , in some sense , a complete description of the asymptotic gibbs measure @xmath71 .",
    "fortunately , a much more explicit and useful description of the asymptotic gibbs measures arose from the study of some related toy models .",

    "the hamiltonian of the rem is given by a vector @xmath98 of independent gaussian random variables with variance @xmath1 , which is a rather classical object .",
    "the grem combines several random energy models in a hierarchical way with the ultrametric structure built into the model from the beginning . even though these simplified models do not shed light on the parisi ansatz in the sk model directly",
    ", the behavior of the gibbs measures in these models was predicted to be , in some sense , identical to that of the sk model .",
    "for example , derrida and toulouse showed in @xcite that the gibbs weights in the rem have the same distribution in the thermodynamic limit as the gibbs weights of the pure states in the sk model , described in @xcite , and de dominicis and hilhorst @xcite demonstrated a similar connection between the distribution of the cluster weights in the grem and the cluster weights in the sk model .",
    "motivated by this connection with the sk model , in a seminal paper @xcite , ruelle gave an alternative , much more explicit and illuminating , description of the gibbs measure of the grem in the infinite - volume limit in terms of a certain family of poisson processes , as follows .",

    "these identities were first discovered by ghirlanda and guerra in @xcite in the setting of the mixed @xmath12-spin models , where they were proved on average over the parameters @xmath19 in ( [ mixedh ] ) .",
    "however , the general idea can be used in many other models if we utilize the mixed @xmath12-spin hamiltonian in the role of a perturbation .",
    "we will try to emphasize wide applicability of this idea by giving some mild sufficient conditions that ensure the validity of these identities . for",

    "this gaussian process is of the same nature as the mixed @xmath12-spin hamiltonian ( [ mixedh ] ) except for a different normalization in ( [ ch31mixedppert ] ) , which implies that the covariance @xmath225 in other words , @xmath226 is of a smaller order than @xmath5 because of the additional factor @xmath227 .",
    "let us now consider a model with an arbitrary hamiltonian @xmath228 on @xmath178 , either random or non - random , and consider the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath229 for some parameter @xmath230 what is the advantage of adding the perturbation term ( [ ch31mixedhpert ] ) to the original hamiltonian of the model ?",
    "the answer to this question lies in the fact that , under certain conditions , this perturbation term , in some sense , regularizes the gibbs measure and forces it to satisfy useful properties without affecting our mail goal  the computation of the free energy . using ( [ ch31covxipert ] ) and the independence of @xmath226 and @xmath228 , it is easy to see that @xmath231 both inequalities follow from jensen s inequality applied either to the sum or the expectation with respect to @xmath226 conditionally on @xmath228 .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    even though the proof of the parisi ansatz that will be described in the next section is based only on the ghirlanda - guerra identities , the reason we mention the aizenman - contucci stochastic stability ( [ ac ] ) is because , in a number of ways , it played a very important role in the development of the area . in particular , one of the main ideas behind the proof of the parisi ansatz was first discovered using a unified stability property , proved in @xcite , that combines the ghirlanda - guerra identities ( [ ch31gglimit ] ) and the aizenman - contucci stochastic stability ( [ ac ] ) .",
    "it can be stated with the notation in ( [ ac ] ) as follows .",
    "it is well known ( we will discuss this again below ) that if the measure @xmath71 satisfies the ghirlanda - guerra identities and if @xmath84 is the largest point of the support of the distribution of the overlap @xmath75 under @xmath290 then , with probability one , @xmath71 is concentrated on the sphere of radius @xmath291 .",

    "interestingly , the unified stability property ( [ main ] ) was known for some time in the setting of the ruelle probability cascades , where it was proved by bolthausen and sznitman in @xcite using properties of the poisson processes in the construction of the ruelle probability cascades .",
    "however , the ghirlanda - guerra identities for the rpc were originally proved by talagrand @xcite and bovier and kurkova @xcite by analyzing the gibbs measure in the derrida rem and grem , and it was only later noticed by talagrand that they follow much more easily from the bolthausen - sznitman invariance .",
    "the main result of @xcite stated in ( [ main ] ) , basically , reverses talagrand s observation .",
    "it was clear since they were discovered that the stability properties impose strong constraints on the structure of the gibbs measure , but the question was whether they lead all the way to the ruelle probability cascades ?",
    "the first partial answer to this question was given in an influential work of arguin and aizenman , @xcite , who proved that , under a technical assumption that the overlap takes only finitely many values in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath296 , the aizenman - contucci stochastic stability ( [ ac ] ) implies the ultrametricity predicted by the parisi ansatz .",
    "soon after , it was shown in @xcite under the same technical assumption that the ghirlanda - guerra identities also imply ultrametricity ( an elementary proof can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "another approach was given by talagrand in @xcite .",
    "however , since at low temperature the overlap does not necessarily take finitely many values in the thermodynamic limit , all these result were not directly applicable to the sk and mixed @xmath12-spin models .",
    "nevertheless , they strongly suggested that the stability properties can explain the parisi ansatz and , indeed , it was recently proved in @xcite that the ghirlanda - guerra identities imply ultrametricity ( [ ultra2 ] ) without any technical assumptions .",

    "[ [ pure - states . ] ] pure states .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    first of all , one can show very easily ( see @xcite ) that the ghirlanda - guerra identities ( [ ch31gglimit ] ) yield the parisi pure states picture described above .",
    "namely , if @xmath84 is the largest point in the support of the distribution @xmath28 of the overlap @xmath75 under @xmath290 defined in ( [ gfop ] ) then , with probability one , @xmath297 .",
    "moreover , the measure @xmath71 is purely atomic if @xmath83 , otherwise , it has no atoms .",
    "of course , it is clear that parisi s pure states picture in @xcite was meant to be understood in approximate sense and , when @xmath298 and @xmath71 has not atoms , we can create pure states using ultrametricity by considering equivalence clusters in ( [ diameter ] ) for small positive diameter @xmath299 . in the case when @xmath83 , the pure states picture holds not only for the asymptotic gibbs measures in the infinite - volume limit , but also for the original gibbs measures @xmath61 for finite size systems in some approximates sense , as was shown by talagrand in @xcite .",
    "[ [ talagrands - positivity - principle . ] ] talagrand s positivity principle .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    another important consequence of the ghirlanda - guerra identities is the so - called talagrand positivity principle , proved in @xcite , which states that the overlaps can take only non - negative values in the thermodynamic limit , so @xmath300 for any two points in the support of @xmath71 . in the parisi replica method ,",
    "the overlap was always assumed to be non - negative due to the symmetry breaking , and we see that this , indeed , can be obtained using a small perturbation of the hamiltonian which ensures the validity of the ghirlanda - guerra identities . one key application of the positivity principle is to show that guerra s interpolation argument leading to the upper bound ( [ fnpzeta2 ] ) also works for mixed @xmath12-spin models that include the pure @xmath12-spin hamiltonians for odd @xmath301 , which was observed by talagrand in @xcite .

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    finally , let us mention a fact that has been well known since the discovery of the ghirlanda - guerra identities , namely , that together with ultrametricity these identities determine the distribution of the entire overlap array uniquely in terms of the functional order parameter @xmath28 and , moreover , one can approximate the overlap array in distribution by an overlap array generated by some ruelle probability cascades .",
    "in other words , as soon as we have ultrametricity , all the predictions of the physicists are confirmed .",
    "the idea here is very straightforward and we will only illustrate it in the simplest case when the overlaps take finitely many values , @xmath296 .",
    "the general case easily follows by approximation . in the discrete case",
    ", we only need to demonstrate that , using ultrametricity and the ghirlanda - guerra identities , we can compute in terms of @xmath28 the probability of any particular configuration of finitely many overlaps , @xmath302 for any @xmath303 and any @xmath304 .",
    "let us find the largest elements among @xmath305 for @xmath306 and , without loss of generality , suppose that @xmath307 is one of them .",
    "we only have to consider @xmath308 that are ultrametric , since , otherwise , ( [ ch44ultraq1 ] ) is equal to zero . in particular , since @xmath307 is the largest , for @xmath309 , @xmath310 and @xmath311 which implies that @xmath312 . hence ,",
    "if the overlap @xmath313 then , for all @xmath314 , @xmath315 automatically implies that @xmath316 and ( [ ch44ultraq1 ] ) equals @xmath317 in other words , if we know that the replicas @xmath10 and @xmath318 are the closest then , due to ultrametricity , all the conditions @xmath319 become redundant and we can omit them .",
    "the quantity ( [ ch44ultraq20 ] ) is now of the same type as the left hand side of ( [ ch31gglimit2 ] ) and , therefore , the ghirlanda - guerra identities imply that it is equal to @xmath320 we can continue this computation recursively over @xmath255 and , in the end , ( [ ch44ultraq1 ] ) will be expressed completely in terms of the distribution of one overlap , @xmath28 . to conclude that the overlap array can actually be generated by the ruelle probability cascades corresponding to the functional order parameter @xmath28 , we only need to recall that both properties , the ghirlanda - guerra identities and ultrametricity , are satisfied by the rpc , so all the probabilities ( [ ch44ultraq1 ] ) will be given by the same computation .",
    "[ [ ultrametricity.-1 ] ] ultrametricity .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it remains to explain the main result in @xcite which shows that ultrametricity is also a consequence of the ghirlanda - guerra identities .",
    "the main idea of the proof is the following invariance property .",
    "given @xmath303 , we consider @xmath255 bounded measurable functions @xmath321 and let @xmath322 for @xmath323 , we define @xmath324 where , as before , @xmath250 denotes the average with respect to @xmath262 .",
    "then , for any bounded measurable function @xmath325 of the overlaps @xmath326 of @xmath255 replicas , @xmath327 where @xmath328 in the denominator is the average in @xmath6 for fixed @xmath329 with respect to the measure @xmath71 .",
    "one can think of the ratio on the right hand side as a change of density that does not affect the distribution of the overlaps of @xmath255 replicas .",
    "originally , this invariance property was discovered using the unified stability property ( [ main ] ) , so the aizenman - contucci stochastic stability played an equally important role .",
    "however , the proof presented in @xcite is much more simple and straightforward , and is based only on the the ghirlanda - guerra identities . in some sense",
    ", this is good news because the aizenman - contucci stability is a more subtle property to work with than the ghirlanda - guerra identities , especially in the thermodynamic limit . to prove ( [ ch45main ] ) , one can consider an interpolating function @xmath330 and , using an elementary calculation , check that the ghirlanda - guerra identities imply that all the derivatives vanish at zero , @xmath331 .",
    "taylor s expansion and some basic estimates of the derivatives yield that this function is constant for all @xmath332 , proving that @xmath333 , which is precisely ( [ ch45main ] ) .",
    "a special feature of the invariance property ( [ ch45main ] ) is that it contains some very useful information not only about the overlaps but also about the gibbs weights of the neighborhoods of the replicas @xmath334 let us give one simple example .",
    "recall that the measure @xmath71 is concentrated on the sphere @xmath335 and , for @xmath336 , let @xmath337 and @xmath338 then @xmath339 is a scaled indicator of a small neighborhood of @xmath10 on the sphere @xmath335 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath340 the gibbs weight of this neighborhood then the average in the denominator in ( [ ch45main ] ) is equal to @xmath341 suppose now that the function @xmath342 is an indicator of the event @xmath343 that the replicas @xmath344 are outside of this neighborhood of @xmath10 .",
    "then , it is easy to see that @xmath345 and ( [ ch45main ] ) becomes @xmath346 which may be viewed as a condition on the weight @xmath347 and the event @xmath348 .",
    "this is just one artificial example , but the idea can be pushed much further and with some work one can obtain some very useful consequences about the structure of the measure @xmath71 .",
    "one of these consequences is the following  duplication property \" .",

    "of course , since all replicas live on the same sphere , this can be expressed in terms of the overlaps , @xmath349 , for some @xmath350 matrix of constraints @xmath351 .",
    "let @xmath352 be the constraint corresponding to the closest point among @xmath353 to the last replica @xmath354 and suppose that the distance between them is strictly positive , @xmath355 . then , using the invariance property ( [ ch45main ] ) , one can show that with positive probability over the choice of @xmath71 one can sample @xmath356 replicas @xmath357 from @xmath71 such that the distances between the first @xmath255 replicas are as above , @xmath349 , and the new replica @xmath318 duplicates @xmath354 in the following sense ( see fig .

    "the motivation for this property becomes clear if we recall how the support of the ruelle probability cascades was constructed in ( [ ch43hs ] ) . in that case",
    "it is obvious that one can always duplicate any replica with probability one , and not just in a weak sense described here . on the other hand",

    "this means that with positive probability we can find replicas @xmath329 on the sphere of radius @xmath291 such that their overlaps satisfy properties ( a ) and ( b ) .",
