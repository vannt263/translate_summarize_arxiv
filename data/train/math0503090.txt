    "to introduce the main theme of this paper we recall the following theorem of casselman @xcite .",

    "let @xmath10 be the maximal ideal of @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a non - trivial additive character of @xmath0 which is normalized so that the maximal fractional ideal on which it is trivial is @xmath9 .",
    "[ thm : casselman ] let @xmath12 be an irreducible admissible infinite - dimensional representation of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the central character of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath14 let @xmath15    @xmath16    1 .",
    "there exists a non - negative integer @xmath17 such that @xmath18 if @xmath6 denotes the least non - negative integer @xmath17 with this property then the epsilon factor @xmath19 of @xmath5 is up to a constant multiple of the form @xmath20 .",
    "( here @xmath21 is the cardinality of the residue field of @xmath0 . ) 2 .   for all @xmath22 we have @xmath23 .",
    "the assertion @xmath24 is sometimes referred to as _ multiplicity one theorem for newforms _ and the unique vector ( up to scalars ) in @xmath25 is called the _ newform _ for @xmath26 this is closely related to the classical atkin  lehner theory of newforms for holomorphic cusp forms on the upper half plane @xcite . when @xmath27 we have a spherical representation and the newform is nothing but the spherical vector .",
    "newforms play an important role in the theory of automorphic forms .",
    "we cite two examples to illustrate this .",
    "first , the zeta integral corresponding to the newform is exactly the local @xmath7-factor associated to @xmath5 ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "in addition , newforms frequently play the role of being ` test vectors ' for interesting linear forms associated to @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the newform is a test vector for an appropriate whittaker linear functional . in showing this , explicit formulae for newforms",
    "are quite often needed .",
    "for instance , if @xmath5 is a supercuspidal representation which is realized in its kirillov model then the newform is the characteristic function of the unit group @xmath28 .",
    "this observation is implicit in casselman @xcite and is explicitly stated and proved in shimizu @xcite . since the whittaker functional on the kirillov model",
    "is given by evaluating functions at @xmath29 , we get in particular that the functional is non - zero on the newform . in a related vein @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that test vectors for trilinear forms for @xmath3 are often built from newforms .",
    "( see also a recent expository paper of schmidt @xcite where many of these results are documented . )    in addition to casselman s theory for @xmath3 , newforms have been studied for certain other classes of groups .",
    "jacquet _ et  al _",
    "@xcite have developed a theory of newforms for _ generic _ representations of @xmath4 . in this",
    "setting , there is no satisfactory statement analogous to ( ii ) of the above theorem .",
    "however , in his recent thesis , mann @xcite obtained several results on the growth of the dimensions of spaces of fixed vectors and has a conjecture about this in general .",
    "for the group @xmath30 , @xmath31 a @xmath32-adic division algebra , prasad and raghuram @xcite have proved an analogue of casselman s theorem for irreducible principal series representations and supercuspidal representations coming via compact induction . in an unpublished work ,",
    "brooks roberts has proved part of ( i ) of the above for representations of @xmath33 whose langlands parameter is induced from a two - dimensional representation of the weil  deligne group of @xmath34 in a previous paper @xcite , we develop a theory of conductors and newforms for @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we use the results of @xcite to carry out a similar program for the unramified quasi split unitary group@xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 crucial to our study of newforms are certain filtrations of maximal compact subgroups of @xmath37 let @xmath38 be the standard hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup of @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 , where @xmath41 then @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , up to conjugacy , the two maximal compact subgroups of @xmath39 .",
    "we define filtrations of these maximal compact subgroups as follows . for @xmath17",
    "an integer @xmath44 let @xmath45    @xmath16    let @xmath46 be an irreducible admissible infinite - dimensional representation of @xmath37 let @xmath47 denote the center of @xmath39 and let @xmath48 be the central character of @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be any character of @xmath51 such that @xmath52 on the center .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the conductor of @xmath54 for any @xmath55 @xmath50 gives a character of @xmath56 and also @xmath57 given by @xmath58 we define for @xmath59 , @xmath60 the space @xmath61 is defined analogously .",
    "we define the _ @xmath50-conductor _ @xmath62 of @xmath49 as @xmath63    we define the _ conductor @xmath64 _ of @xmath49 by @xmath65 where @xmath50 runs over characters of @xmath51 which restrict to the central character @xmath48 on @xmath47 .",
    "we deal with the following basic issues in this paper .    1 .   given an irreducible representation @xmath49 , we determine its conductor @xmath66 a very easy consequence ( almost built into the definition ) is that the conductor depends only on the @xmath7-packet containing @xmath49 .",
    "we identify the conductor with other invariants associated to the representation .",
    "for instance , for @xmath2 we have shown @xcite that the conductor of a representation is same as the conductor of a minimal representation of @xmath3 determining its @xmath7-packet .",
    "we prove a similar result for @xmath1 in this paper .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] and  [ sec : comparison - u11 ] .",
    "3 .   we determine the growth of the space @xmath67 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "this question is analogous to ( ii ) of casselman s theorem quoted above .",
    "computing such dimensions is of importance in ` local level raising ' issues .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we address the question of whether there is a multiplicity one result for newforms .",
    "it turns out that quite often @xmath68 , but this fails in general ( for principal series representations of a certain kind ) . in these exceptional cases",
    "the dimension of the space of newforms is two , but a canonical quotient of this two - dimensional space has dimension one ( see   [ sec : multiplicity - one ] ) .",
    "5 .   are the newforms test vectors for whittaker functionals ?",
    "this is important in global issues related to newforms .",
    "we are grateful to benedict gross for suggesting this question to us .",
    "it turns out that our newforms are always test vectors for whittaker functionals . in the proofs",
    "we often need explicit formulae for newforms in various models for the representations .",
    "these formulas are interesting for their own sake .",
    "for example , if @xmath12 is a ramified supercuspidal representation of @xmath1 , then the newform can be taken as the characteristic function of @xmath69 where @xmath70 is regarded as a subspace of the kirillov model of a canonically associated minimal representation of @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we set up notation in  [ sec : notation ] following that used in @xcite .",
    "we then briefly review the structure of @xmath7-packets for @xmath71 and @xmath35 in  [ sec : packets - sl2-u11 ] . as this paper depends crucially on our previous paper  @xcite on @xmath71",
    ", we summarize the results of  @xcite in  [ sec : newforms ] .",
    "the heart of this paper is  [ sec : unitary ] . in  [",
    "sec : defns - u11 ] we define the notion of conductor and then make some easy but technically important remarks on spaces of fixed vectors .",
    "the next two subsections deal respectively with sub - quotients of principal series representations and supercuspidal representations . in @xcite",
    ", we use kutzko s construction of supercuspidal representations of @xmath3 to obtain results for supercuspidals of @xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we use these results , in turn , to obtain information for @xmath1 . in general",
    ", we will often reduce the proofs of statements concerning @xmath1 to those of the corresponding @xmath2 statements .",
    "in particular , we exploit the fact that @xmath2 is the derived group of @xmath1 and that @xmath72 has index two in @xmath73 in this way we avoid directly dealing with @xmath74-types and other intrinsic details for @xmath75 as much of the work has been done for @xmath2 in  @xcite .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : multiplicity - one ] , we briefly discuss a multiplicity one result fornewforms .",
    "we mention some further directions that arise naturally from this work . to begin with , it would be interesting to see how our theory of newforms and conductors bears upon known results about local factors for @xmath1 . in particular , are our conductors the same as ( or closely related to ) the analytic conductors appearing in epsilon factors ? also , is a zeta - integral corresponding to a newform of a representation equal to a local @xmath7-factor for the representation ?",
