    "furthermore , the spatial clustering of galaxies is also one of the key pieces of observational data to establish the relation between galaxies and dark matter ( halos ) statistically(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to understand how galaxies form and evolve in the cosmic density field .",
    "one of the main goals of large redshift surveys of galaxies , such as the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is , therefore , to provide a data base to study the three dimensional distribution of galaxies as accurately possible .",
    "however , a key problem this endeavor is that redshifts of galaxies are not exact measures of distances due to the peculiar motions of galaxies .",
    "the spatial distribution and clustering of galaxies observed in redshift space are thus distorted with respect to the real - space distribution and clustering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "take the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of galaxies as an example .",
    "the 2pcf in the 2-dimensional space , with 1 dimension along the line - of - sight and the other in the perpendicular direction , appears elongated on small scales and squashed on large scales along the line - of - sight direction , in contrast to an isotropic pattern expected from a statistically homogeneous and isotropic distribution in real space .",
    "such anisotropies are clearly produced by redshift distortions and need to be corrected in order to get the true distribution of galaxies in space .",
    "theoretically , models of the pairwise peculiar velocities of galaxies have been used to model the effects of redshift distortions on the measured 2pcf in redshift space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , one simply measures the projected 2pcf and uses it to infer the three - dimensional 2pcf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the gravitational instability scenario of structure formation ,",
    "the redshift distortion is not just a contamination one has to correct in order to get the real clustering of galaxies , it in fact contains useful information about cosmology as well as the mass distribution in the universe . on large scales , the infall motions of galaxies , which produce the squashing in the 2d redshift - space 2pcf ( the kaiser effect ,",
    "* ) , is linearly proportional to the amplitudes of the mass density fluctuations on large - scales . in this case , one can compute the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio of the 2d 2pcf to get @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the density parameter of mass , and @xmath9 is the effective linear bias of the galaxies in question ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "when the measurement is combined with weak gravitational lensing results , it can also be used as a sensitive probe of ( modified ) gravitation theories on cosmology scales @xcite . on smaller scales",
    ", the modeling of redshift space distortion ( the finger of god effect ) is complicated by the nonlinear mapping between real - space and redshift - space .",
    "great efforts have been made not only to understand its impacts on galaxy clustering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also to extract useful cosmological information ( mo , jing & boerner 1993 ; jing , mo & boerner 1998 ; yang et al .",
    "2004 ; li et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the approaches adopted earlier to deal with redshift distortions in galaxy clustering have been hampered by the fact that the large - scale kaiser effect and the small - scale finger of god effect are interwoven , and models based on a simple pairwise peculiar velocity distribution can only be served as an approximation .",
    "the situation is complicated even more by the fact that the effect bias in galaxy distribution may be nonlinear and its form is not known _ a priori_. models based on the projected correlation function has its own problem , because the projection mixes clustering on different scales so that the conversion from the projected function to the three dimensional function can be uncertain .",
    "thus , in order to make full use of galaxy redshift surveys to study the large - scale structure of the universe , a change of tactics is needed .",
    "one possible way is first to make corrections of redshift distortions for individual galaxies , and then use the ` pseudo ' real space distribution of galaxies to derive statistical measures of galaxy clustering in real space . as mentioned above , redshift distortions are of two different kinds .",
    "one is the kaiser effect produced by the coherent flow due to the gravitational action of large - scale structure @xcite , the other is the finger of god ( fog ) effect generated by the random motions of galaxies within virialized halos on small scales . to deal with the fog effect ,",
    "@xcite used an friends - of - friends method to link galaxies and suppressed the over - density of the pairs along the line of sight by a factor of 10 .",
    "they applied this fog suppression to the 2dfgrs @xcite and sdss @xcite in their estimates of the power spectra of galaxy distribution . in a paper aimed at reconstructing the cosmic web from 2dfgrs",
    ", @xcite attempted to dealt with the fog effect by compressing 25 fingers seen in redshift space using groups identified by @xcite . for the kaiser effect",
    ", @xcite used a bias model to get the density field from the galaxy distribution and iteratively corrected the infall motions of galaxies .",
    "along the same line , a number of approaches have been taken to recover / correct the infall motions on the basis of galaxy distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite used galaxy groups as proxies of dark matter halos to reconstruct the density field , which in turn was used to obtain the velocity field .    so far there has been no real attempt to correct for both the large scale velocities and small scale random motions of galaxies in a systematic way .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to carry out such an investigation , using galaxies observed in the sdss dr7 , which is still among the best redshift surveys available .",
    "based on this galaxy catalog , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter y07 ) have constructed a galaxy group catalog using an adaptive halo - based group finder ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". detailed tests with mock galaxy catalogues have shown that the group finder is very successful in associating galaxies according to their common dark matter halos .",
    "in particular , the group finder performs reliably not only for rich systems , but also for poor systems , including isolated central galaxies in low mass halos .",
    "the reliable memberships of galaxies in groups provide a unique opportunity to correct for the fog effects for individual galaxy systems .",
    "in addition , as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter w12 ) , the group catalog can also be used to reconstruct the mass density , tidal and velocity ( mtv ) fields in the sdss dr7 volume , using the halo - domain method developed in @xcite . since the relation between halo and mass distributions is better understood than that between galaxies and mass , the mass and velocity fields constructed are much more accurate than those constructed directly from the galaxy distribution .",
    "the redshift distortions on large scales can , therefore , also be modeled accurately for individual galaxies .",
    "with all these , we can obtain a catalog of galaxies in quasi - real space .",
    "we can then not only examine in detail various types of redshift distortions , but also measure the real space clustering of galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in section 2",
    "we present the galaxy and group catalogs used in this paper .",
    "section 3 introduces the methods to correct for the redshift distortions and to characterize the galaxy clustering . in section 4",
    "we use mock galaxy catalogs to test the reliability of our correction model .",
    "the application to the sdss dr7 and the results are presented in section 5 . finally , we summarize our main findings in section 6 . throughout this paper ,",
    "unless stated otherwise , physical quantities are quoted using the wmap9 cosmological parameters @xcite : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the galaxy sample used in this paper is constructed from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is based on sdss dr7 @xcite , but with an independent set of significantly improved reductions over the original pipeline .",
    "in addition , as galaxy groups play a key role in our approach to correct for the redshift distortions , we make use of the group catalog constructed in ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter y12 ) for sdss dr7 .",
    "this group catalog is based on all galaxies in the main galaxy sample with extinction - corrected apparent magnitude brighter than @xmath16 , with redshifts in the range @xmath17 and with a redshift completeness @xmath18 .",
    "the catalog contains a total of 639,359 galaxies with a sky coverage of 7,748 deg@xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the galaxy catalog mainly covers two sky regions : a larger contiguous region in the northern galactic cap ( ngc ) and a smaller three - stripe region in the southern galactic cap ( sgc ) .",
    "the former contains 584,473 galaxies with a sky coverage of 7,047 deg@xmath19 .",
    "based on this sdss dr7 galaxy catalog , y12 used the adaptive halo - based group finder developed by y05 to select galaxy groups .",
    "this group finder has been applied to the sdss dr4 in y07 .",
    "following y07 , the masses of the associated dark matter halos are estimated based on the ranking of the total characteristic luminosities of groups or the total characteristic stellar masses using group member galaxies more luminous than @xmath20 . both halo masses agree very well with each other , and we adopt the halo masses based on the characteristic luminosity ranking in this paper . in addition , we have updated group membership as well as halo masses according to wmap9 cosmology .",
    "using this group catalog , w12 reconstructed the velocity field , which we use in this paper to correct for the redshift space distortions .",
    "the method of w12 explicitly depends on the density field as represented by dark matter halos above a given mass threshold , @xmath21 .",
    "we adopt @xmath22 and so , to be complete , restrict our sample to the nearby volume covering the redshift range @xmath23 , we use groups in the redshift range @xmath24 for our velocity reconstruction . ] .",
    "in addition , since the w12 reconstruction method can be significantly impacted by survey boundaries , we focus only on the more contiguous ngc region .",
    "applying all these selection criteria to the galaxy and group catalogs leaves us with a set of 286,043 groups , hosting a total of 396,068 galaxies in the ngc region with redshifts in the range @xmath25 .",
    "finally , using this sample we construct both flux - limited and volume - limited subsamples for galaxies in the following six absolute @xmath26-band magnitude bins : @xmath27 @xmath28}$ ] , @xmath29}$ ] , @xmath30}$ ] , @xmath31}$ ] , @xmath32}$ ] and @xmath33}$ ] .",
    "the corresponding redshift ranges , numbers of galaxies and averaged magnitude are indicated in table  [ subsamp ] .",
    "these luminosity samples are further divided into blue and red subsamples , as detailed in section [ sec : clusan ] .",
    "note that there is no difference in the redshift limit between the flux - limited and volume - limited for the first two brightest samples , because all the galaxies with such luminosities can be observed to @xmath34 . for a fainter sample , even the brightest galaxies in the luminosity bin can be observed only to redshift @xmath35 . in most cases",
    "we only show results obtained from the flux limited samples , because the results obtained from the volume limited samples are very similar .",
    "note also that in the reconstructed real space , which we will perform later , the number of galaxies in a sample will change very slightly .",
    "we now turn to our main goal : correcting the sdss redshifts for redshift space distortions induced by peculiar velocities , thus allowing for a direct measurement of the two - point correlation functions of galaxies in real space . before delving into details ,",
    "we first introduce some concepts regarding redshift space distortions and our approach to correct for them .      in the absence of peculiar velocities ,",
    "the redshift of a galaxy , @xmath36 , is directly related to its comoving distance , @xmath26 . for a flat universe ,",
    "this relation is given by @xmath37{\\omega_\\lambda+\\omega_{{\\rm m}}(1+z)^3}},\\ ] ] with @xmath38 the hubble constant .",
    "in reality , though , the observed redshift of a galaxy , @xmath39 , consists of a cosmological contribution , @xmath40 , arising from the hubble expansion plus a doppler contribution , @xmath41 , due to the galaxy s peculiar velocity along the line - of - sight , @xmath42 . in the non - relativistic case we have that @xmath43 with @xmath44 the speed of light .",
    "the redshift distance , @xmath45 , of a galaxy inferred from its observed redshift differs from its true comoving distance , which is given by @xmath45 .",
    "hence , peculiar velocities give rise to redshift space distortions ( rsds ) , which complicate the interpretation of galaxies clustering but also contain important additional information about the cosmic mass distribution .",
    "after all , the peculiar velocities are induced by this matter distribution , which is itself correlated with the distribution of galaxies . on small scales",
    "the virialized motion of galaxies within dark matter halos cause a reduction of the correlation power , known as the finger - of - god ( fog ) effect , while on larger scales the correlations are boosted due to the infall motion of galaxies towards overdensity regions , know as the kaiser effect @xcite .",
    "since each galaxy is believed to reside in a dark matter halo , it is useful to split the peculiar velocity of a galaxy into two components : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the line - of - sight velocity of the center of the halo , and @xmath48 is the line - of - sight component of the velocity vector of the galaxy with respect to that halo center . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath47 is a manifestation of the kaiser effect ( at least on large scales ) , while @xmath48 mainly contributes to the fog effect .",
    "hence , for convenience in what follows , we define the kaiser and fog redshifts as @xmath49 @xmath50 the various redshifts thus defined , allow us to define a number of different spaces , in addition to the standard real and redshift spaces .",
    "table  [ spaces ] gives a brief description of the various spaces used in this study . in each space , galaxy distances",
    "are computed using their corresponding redshifts injected into eq .",
    "all spaces have the geometry of the sdss dr7 .",
    "the top four spaces listed , are based on true velocities and true groups ( dark matter halos ) , without observational errors , or errors in group identifications and/or membership .",
    "the bottom three spaces ( those starting with ` re ' ) , on the other hand , are reconstructed spaces , obtained by correcting for the corresponding redshift distortions .",
    "these are based on the reconstructed velocity field , and on groups identified applying the group finder in redshift space ( see  [ sec : correction ] below ) . in what follows",
    ", we refer to the top four spaces as ` true ' spaces , and the lower three spaces as ` reconstructed ' spaces .",
    "we now describe our method to correct the redshifts in the sdss dr7 survey volume for redshift space distortions .",
    "the method separately treats the kaiser effect and the fog effect , as detailed below .      in order to correct for the kaiser effect , we reconstruct the velocity field in the linear regime using the method of w12 . here",
    "we briefly summarize the main ingredients of this reconstruction method , and refer the reader to w12 for more details . in the linear regime ,",
    "the peculiar velocities are induced by , and proportional to , the perturbations in the matter distribution .",
    "if we write the velocity field , @xmath51 , as a sum of fourier modes , @xmath52 then , in the linear regime , each mode can be written as @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the hubble parameter , @xmath55 is the scale factor , @xmath56 is the fourier transform of the density perturbation field @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence , for a given cosmology one can directly infer the linear velocity field from the density perturbation field , @xmath57 .",
    "the challenge , however , is to reconstruct the matter field from observations in redshift space .",
    "the unique aspect of the w12 method is that it does nt try to reconstruct @xmath59 , but instead focuses on the matter density field , @xmath60 , which is the ( large scale ) matter distribution due to dark matter halos with a mass @xmath61 .",
    "as is well known , dark matter halos are biased tracers of the mass distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on large , linear scales we have that @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the linear bias parameter for dark matter halos with mass @xmath61 , which is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the halo mass function and the halo bias function , respectively .",
    "hence , one can reconstruct the peculiar velocity field ( on linear scales ) from @xmath67 using @xmath68 in other words , the velocity field can be reconstructed even if we only have the distribution of dark matter halos above some mass threshold .",
    "this is fortunate , since it means that we can use our galaxy group catalog , in which galaxy groups are linked with dark matter halos above some mass threshold .    in order to reconstruct the velocity field in the sdss survey volume ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we first embed the survey volume in a period , cubic box of @xmath69 on a side .",
    "the size of this ` survey box ' is chosen to be about @xmath70 larger than the maximum scale of the survey volume among the three axes .",
    "next , we divide the box into @xmath71 grid cells , and use groups with an assigned mass @xmath72 to compute @xmath73 on that grid using the method described in detail in w12 . in order to suppress non - linear velocities that are not captured by the linear model",
    ", we smooth @xmath73 using a gaussian smoothing kernel with a mass scale of @xmath74 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "next , we fast fourier transform ( fft ) this smoothed overdensity field , and compute @xmath75 using eq .",
    "( [ vrecover ] ) , where @xmath63 is computed using eq .",
    "( [ bhm ] ) adopting the halo mass and bias functions of @xcite .",
    "fourier transforming @xmath75 then yields the velocity field , which we interpret as @xmath76 , the velocity field of group centers . finally , the comoving distance of each galaxy , corrected for the kaiser effect , is computed as @xmath77 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ [ distance_z ] ] ) . here",
    "@xmath78 with @xmath47 the inferred line - of - sight velocity at the location of the group to which the galaxy belongs .",
    "the location of the group is defined as the luminosity weighted center of all group members .",
    "since the velocity field is computed using the redshift - space distribution of the groups , this method needs to be iterated until convergence is achieved . using the inferred @xmath79 , we correct the redshifts of all groups with an inferred mass @xmath61 for their ( inferred ) peculiar velocity , and recompute @xmath73 and @xmath79 using the same method . as shown in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "typically two iterations suffice to reach convergence , yielding an unbiased estimate of the linear velocity field .",
    "the finger - of - god effect arises due to the motion of galaxies inside their dark matter halos .",
    "to first order , one can simply correct for the fog effect by assigning all group galaxies the redshift of the group , and then computing the comoving distance using eq .",
    "( [ distance_z ] ) .",
    "however , this ignores the spatial extent of dark matter halos , which can be quite substantial .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to infer a galaxy s line - of - sight location from its peculiar velocity along that line - of - sight .",
    "hence , one can only correct for the fog effect in a statistical sense , which we do as follows .",
    "we assume that group galaxies are unbiased tracers of the halo s mass distribution , and therefore follow a nfw @xcite , radial number density profile @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the characteristic radius and the normalization parameter @xmath82 can be expressed in terms of the halo concentration parameter @xmath83 as @xmath84^{-1}\\ ] ] here @xmath85 is the number of group member galaxies , and @xmath86 is the radius inside of which the halo has an average overdensity of 180 .",
    "numerical simulations show that halo concentration depends on halo mass , and we use the relation given by @xcite , converted to the @xmath44 appropriate for our definition of halo mass .    in practice",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "we do not displace central galaxies , which are defined to be the brightest group members .",
    "for satellite galaxies ( all members other than centrals ) , we first calculate the project distance @xmath87 between the galaxy and the luminosity weighted center of its group .",
    "then we randomly draw a line - of - sight distance , @xmath88 , for the galaxy whose probability follows eq .",
    "[ eq : nfw ] with @xmath89 .",
    "the galaxy is then assigned a comoving distance given by @xmath90 , with the @xmath91 of eq .",
    "( [ zcorr ] ) .",
    "we have verified that using the location of the central galaxy , rather than the luminosity weighted center of the group , yields results that are virtually indistinguishable .      in this paper",
    ", we use 2pcfs to characterize the clustering of galaxies .",
    "we estimate the two - dimensional 2pcf , @xmath92 , for galaxies in each sample using the following estimator : @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are , respectively , the number of galaxy - galaxy , random - random and galaxy - random pairs with separation @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the variables @xmath87 and @xmath98 are the pair separations perpendicular and parallel to the line - of - sight , respectively .",
    "explicitly , for a pair of galaxies , one located at @xmath99 and the other at @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , we define @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the line of sight intersecting the pair and @xmath104 .",

    "the summation is over 100 bins of @xmath107 , corresponding to an integration from @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "the one - dimensional , redshift - space 2pcf , @xmath6 , is estimated by averaging @xmath110 along constant @xmath111 using @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the cosine of the angle between the line - of - sight and the redshift - space separation vector @xmath114 .",
    "alternatively , one can also measure @xmath6 by directly counting @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath115 pairs as a function of redshift - space separation @xmath116 .    whereas @xmath117 and @xmath6 are affected by rsds , and can therefore differ dramatically in different spaces ( real space , redshift space , kaiser space , or fog space ) , the projected correlation function , which is integrated along the line - of - sight , is insensitive to rsds . in practice , though , since we only integrate over a finite extent , the projected correlation function is hampered by residual redshift space distortions ( rrsds ) .",

    "we have shown , though , that the one - dimensional 2pcf , @xmath6 , inferred directly from the reconstructed real space is not significantly affected , with deviations typically being smaller than the uncertainties arising from cosmic variance ( at least for a sdss - like survey ) . in fact , over the range of scales @xmath236 , the average error on the reconstructed real space 2pcf is less than two percent .",
    "hence , our method is capable of correcting redshift distortions in redshift surveys to a level that allows for an accurate , unbiased measurement of the real - space correlation function .",
    "we have applied our reconstruction method to the sdss dr7 , giving a real space version of the main galaxy catalog which contains 396,068 galaxies in the ngc with redshifts in the range @xmath237 .",
    "this real space galaxy catalog is publicly available at link : url[http://gax.shao.ac.cn / data / data1/sdss7_real.tar ] .",
    "we emphasize that the fog correction is only statistical in nature , and that the line - of - sight position of satellite galaxies in the catalog have been assigned at random , in accordance with our assumption that satellite galaxies are an unbiased tracer of the mass distribution of their host halo .    using the reconstructed real space data we have shown that the sloan great wall , the largest known structure in the universe , is not as dominant an over - dense structure as it appears in redshift space , but that its apparent over - density is strongly enhanced by the kaiser effect .",
    "we have measured the 2pcfs in reconstructed real space in different absolute magnitude bins .",
    "they all deviate clearly from a simple power - law , revealing a clear 1-halo to 2-halo transition .",
    "a comparison with the corresponding 2pcfs in redshift space nicely demonstrates how redshift space distortions boost the correlation on large scales ( by about @xmath2 at a scale of @xmath219 ) , while suppressing it on small scales ( by about @xmath4 at a scale of @xmath238 ) .",
    "we have also measured the real - space autocorrelation functions of blue and red galaxies , and their across - correlations .",
    "using the real - space ( color - dependent ) @xmath6 , we have investigated how the bias factor depends on galaxy luminosity and color , and how our method provides more reliable measurements of galaxy bias factors than the traditional method that uses the projected 2pcf , @xmath168 .",
    "the present paper , the first paper in a series , is focused on the methodology . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will use our reconstructed , real - space sdss galaxy catalog to study in more detail how the real space clustering of galaxies depends on their intrinsic properties , such as luminosity , stellar mass , color and star formation rate .",
    "we will also use our reconstruction method to put constraints on cosmological parameters as well as halo occupation models . as",
    "briefly mentioned in  [ sec : clusan ] , the actual reconstruction is cosmology dependent , as the bias parameter @xmath63 , the halo masses assigned to galaxy groups , and the distance - redshift relation are all cosmology dependent .",
    "consequently , assuming an incorrect cosmology can result in systematic errors in our reconstruction , and distortions in the correlation functions .",
    "we can then model such distortions and constrain cosmological parameters by searching for the model that gives the best reconstructed real space , so that @xmath110 is isotropic ( i.e. , quadrupole - to - monopole ratio is close to zero ) .",
