    "high - pressure raman measurements showed that in the case of double - walled carbon nanotubes ( dwcnts ) the inner tube supports the outer one up to high pressure before the collapse.@xcite on the contrary , iodine and c@xmath3 fillers are supposed to cause a destabilization of the swcnts.@xcite    up to now , the stability of swcnts and dwcnts against hydrostatic pressure has been mainly addressed by raman spectroscopy , which monitors the vibrational properties .",
    "surprisingly , pressure experiments on carbon nanotubes using techniques probing the electronic structure , like optical spectroscopy , are rare and mostly cover only the low - pressure regime.@xcite in general , optical spectroscopy is a powerful technique to characterize the electronic band structure in terms of the energy position and spectral weight of the excited interband and intraband transitions .",

    "[ fgr : nitrogen2](a ) ] the pressure - induced shifts show a steep increase at the critical pressures p@xmath33@xmath23  gpa , p@xmath34@xmath27  gpa , and p@xmath35@xmath213  gpa , followed by a plateau . according to earlier results and theoretical predictions,@xcite we interpret the anomaly at p@xmath33 in terms of a structural phase transition , where the tube is deformed from a circular to an oval shape . above p@xmath34 a more drastic change in the cross section from oval to race - track or peanut - type shape",
    "occurs.@xcite the plateau with an onset at p@xmath35 indicates a saturation of the pressure - induced deformation above this critical pressure .",
    "according to recent pressure investigations on swcnts with an average tube diameter of 1.35  nm , the transition pressure for the collapse of the tubes amounts to @xmath014  gpa.@xcite since the average tube diameter in our swcnt sample is slightly larger , a slightly smaller transition pressure is to be expected .",

    "[ fgr : nitrogen2 ] .",
    "interestingly , stabilization effects due to nitrogen filling of the swcnts are not found in our data .",
    "furthermore , we obtain qualitatively similar results ( not shown ) when using argon as pressure transmitting medium . in conclusion , neither nitrogen nor argon filling of the swcnts prevents pressure - induced anomalies in the electronic transitions due to tubular deformation , in contradiction to earlier reports.@xcite    the relative energy shifts of the optical transitions s@xmath20 , s@xmath21 , and m@xmath20 in the dwcnt bundles are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fgr : nitrogen2](b ) .",
    "the first important result is that the redshift of absorption bands in dwcnts is small compared to the swcnts , and within the error bars an approximately linear behavior with a pressure coefficient in the range @xmath09 - 15  @xmath9/gpa is found . for swcnts in comparison ,",
    "the relative ( non - linear ) energy shift of the bands as a function of pressure is significantly larger and has reached large values already at p@xmath33 .",
    "the smaller redshift of the absorption bands in dwcnts indicates that pressure - induced @xmath26-@xmath27 hybridization and symmetry breaking effects are reduced in the outer tubes of the dwcnts .",
    "hence , already at low pressures , i.e. , before a structural transition takes place , the outer tube is mechanically stabilized by the inner tube .",
    "this finding is in contrast to earlier results obtained by raman studies which probe the vibrational properties : here , the pressure coefficient of the tangential optical phonon mode for the outer tube was found to be similar to the one in swcnts , and also severe pressure - induced fading and broadening of the tangential and radial breathing modes of the outer tubes were observed.@xcite thus , in these earlier investigations stabilization effects by the inner tubes were not obvious in the low - pressure regime .    above @xmath012",
    "gpa the relative energy shifts of the absorption bands in the dwcnt bundles steeply increase , followed by a plateau above @xmath014  gpa [ see fig .",
    "[ fgr : nitrogen2](b ) ] .",
    "this anomalous behavior signals the onset of strong pressure - induced alterations in the electronic properties of the outer tube at a critical pressure p@xmath1@xmath212  gpa related to tubular deformation .",
    "the pressure p@xmath1 is a factor of @xmath04 higher than the first critical pressure p@xmath33 in swcnts with a similar average diameter .",
    "several earlier experimental studies ( mostly raman ) reported higher critical pressures for the structural transition of the outer tube in dwcnts as compared to swcnts , and this was attributed to the structural support of the outer tube by the inner tube.@xcite the enhanced structural stability of the outer tube was theoretically predicted by yang et al .",
    "@xcite : for small - diameter ( 5,5)(10,10 ) dwcnt bundles ( @xmath36@xmath20.68  nm , @xmath37@xmath21.36  nm ) a small discontinuous volume change appears at the critical pressure p@xmath1=18  gpa , accompanied by a cross sections change between two deformed hexagons ; the collapse to peanut shaped cross sections , however , happens at higher pressure . in contrast , ( 7,7)(12,12 ) dwcnt bundles ( @xmath36@xmath20.95  nm , @xmath37@xmath21.63  nm ) undergo one structural phase transition and collapse at p@xmath1=10.6  gpa . because of the similar diameters , our dwcnts are expected to show similar effects under pressure like the ( 5,5)(10,10 ) dwcnts , but with a somewhat smaller value of the critical pressure .",
    "according to molecular dynamics simulations by gadagkar et al.@xcite the tubes cross sections remain nearly circular up to a critical pressure , where the tube cross sections are deformed to an elliptical shape .",
    "the critical pressure follows a 1/@xmath38 dependence,@xcite where the effective radius of the dwcnt @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 with n=2 for dwcnts .",
    "based on this relation we calculate the effective radius for our dwcnt bundles with d@xmath41@xmath20.80  nm and d@xmath42@xmath21.45  nm , as estimated from the hrtem images and raman spectroscopy,@xcite to @xmath39@xmath20.5  nm and obtain a critical pressure value of p@xmath1@xmath211  gpa according to ref .  .",
    "thus , our experimental finding of a critical pressure p@xmath1@xmath212  gpa is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions for the onset of the deformations of the tube cross - sections in dwcnts bundles .",
    "corresponding experiments on dwcnts using argon as pressure transmitting medium ( not shown ) give qualitatively similar results .    finally , we comment on the reversibility of the pressure - induced structural changes .",
    "for both swcnts and dwcnts the pressure - induced frequency shifts of the optical transitions are reversible upon pressure release [ see figs .",

    "this is illustrated in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fgr : nitrogen1](a ) and ( b ) , where the optical absorbance spectra at the lowest pressure during pressure release are included .",
    "the irreversible changes indicate that a fraction of the tubes has been permanently damaged during pressure loading , with a loss of the characteristic features in their density of states .",
