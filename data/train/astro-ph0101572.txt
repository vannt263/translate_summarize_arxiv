    "theoretical work on the evolution of cataclysmic variables ( howell , rappaport , and politano 1997 ; howell , nelson , rappaport 2001 ) indicates that the majority of the present - day population will have very short orbital periods and should contain low mass ( ( m@xmath4 @xmath0 0.06 @xmath5 ) , brown dwarf - like secondary stars .",
    "an observationally defined group , the tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf novae or toads ( howell , szkody & cannizzo 1995 ; politano , howell , & rappaport 1998 ) has been speculated as being examples of this type of cataclysmic variable ( cv ) .",
    "the orbital period of cvs evolve to shorter period until a period minimum of about 78 minutes is reached . at this time",
    ", the binary evolves to _ longer _",
    "orbital periods with the secondary star continuing to lose mass and becoming a brown dwarf - like object .",
    "the secondaries are best described as  brown dwarf - like \" as most started their lives as normal , lower main sequence ( g - m ) dwarfs .",
    "ll and has an orbital period of near 78 minutes , based on superoutburst observations by howell & hurst ( 1994 ) .",
    "recently , szkody et al . , ( 2000 ) presented a minimum light ( v=19.9 ) optical spectrum ( 4000 - 7000 ) of ll and obtained 3 years past its last superoutburst .",
    "their spectrum revealed weak , double - peaked line emission and a rising blue continuum which they fit with an 11,000k , 0.6m@xmath6 white dwarf .",
    "they found no evidence for the secondary star and concluded that the weak line emission and essentially absent disk contribution were indications of an extremely low mass transfer rate ; the system being in a  deep quiescence \" given the 3 year time passage since ll and s last superoutburst .",
    "ef eri ( p@xmath7=81 min ) contains a white dwarf with a strong magnetic field , b=18 mg , as determined from high state ir spectral observations made in 1992 ( ferrario et al .",
    "1996 ) . at that time , the k band spectral appearance of ef eri was typical of a high state polar , strong h and he emission and broad continuum modulation due to cyclotron humps with no indication of the secondary star .",
    "ef eri has a v magnitude of 14.5 during high states but was at v=18 in february 1997 ( wheatly & ramsey 1998 ) .",
    "the low state spectrum obtained by wheatly & ramsey revealed only weak line and cyclotron emission . according to aavso records ,",
    "ef eri has been fainter than v=17.5 for almost four years now , remaining in an extended low state .",
    "beuermann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) modeled the spectrum obtained by wheatly & ramsey and fit it with a cool wd ( t@xmath8=9500k , the coolest known wd in a cv ) .",
    "these authors set strict observational limits that the secondary star must be later then m9v , have t@xmath9 2000k , and probably a mass @xmath0 0.06 m@xmath2 .    to date",
    ", there have been a few papers providing indirect observational evidence that some short period cvs contain sub - stellar secondaries ( eg .",

    ", 1998 ; v592 her - van teeseling et al . , 1999 ;",
    "ef eri - beuermann et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "however , until now , no direct unambiguous observational proof has been presented .",
    "this _ letter _ reports the first direct observational evidence for a brown dwarf - like secondary star in a toad and provides the first spectroscopic discovery of brown dwarf - like secondary stars in the cvs ll and and ef eri .",
    "k - band spectroscopy of ll and was obtained on ut 2000 october 20 and of ef eri on ut 2000 december 2 using the 3.8  m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "the observations covered the wavelength range from @xmath10  and were made with the ukirt cooled grating spectrometer ( cgs4 ) equipped with a 256 @xmath11 256 insb array . details of the data reduction procedures can be found in howell et al . , ( 2000 ) .    our 1 hr k band observation of ll and ( fig .",
    "1 ) is seven years past superoutburst and shows no evidence for continuum accretion or line emission , only the secondary star is seen .",
    "it appears that all mass transfer has ceased in ll and .",
    "convolution with a k filter yields k@xmath117.5 - 18 mag for ll and .",
    "our 2 hr k band spectrum of ef eri ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows no evidence of line emission or continuum accretion flux indicating that mass transfer is stopped .",
    "convolution with a k filter yields k=14.6@xmath120.2 mag for ef eri .",
    "we note here that in these systems , the wd will contribute @xmath04% of the flux at 2.2 microns ( see ciardi et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "both secondary stars are clearly very different from any previously obtained ir spectra of any cv ( see dhillon et al . , 2000 and refs therein ) .",
    "our spectrum of the secondary star in ll and contains the ubiquitous blue - ward broad water absorption band common in many cool red objects , possible co absorption , and shows a continuum break at 2.2 microns .",
    "the spectrum of ll and has a similar appearance to the bona fide methane ",
    "t \" type brown dwarf sdss 1254 ( leggett et al . , 2000b and references therein ) . given this similarity , the strength of the water feature , and the expected cool temperature of the secondary",
    ", we attribute the 2.2 micron break in ll and to methane ; a common feature in very cool , low mass objects ( leggett et al .",
    ", 2000b ) .",
    "the presence of ch@xmath13 sets an upper limit on the effective temperature of the secondary star in ll and of @xmath11300k ( leggett et al . , 2000a ) .",
    "the yet unidentified broad features seen throughout the spectrum of ll and are similar to equally unidentified features seen in an optical spectrum of the faint toad al com ( howell et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "these absorption features could be caused by dust formation in the cool secondary atmosphere based on the similarity of these broad absorptions with dust features seen in model spectra of cool dusty brown dwarf photospheres ( hauschildt 2000 ) .",
    "ef eri shows the typical broad water absorption bands seen in cool stars ( leggett et al . , 2001 ) with possible co absorption at 2.3 microns and red - ward .",
    "the broad blue - ward water feature provides continuum depth and slope information which can be used to place constraints on the effective temperature of cool stars . defining an index for the water band , d@xmath14=@xmath15 , we find ( figure 2 ) that a good relation exists for stars of type m0 to l9 , albeit not single valued .",
    "d@xmath14 breaks down for the t stars due to the presence of ch@xmath13 absorption . for ef eri , d@xmath14=1.29 indicating either spectral type m6 or l4 - 5 and the lack of methane absorption at 2.2 microns sets a lower limit of t@xmath8@xmath11300k .",
    "an m6v secondary star will not fit in the roche lobe of ef eri given its short orbital period .",
    "this fact , along with the  later than m9 \" constraint imposed by beuermann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , lead us to conclude that the secondary star in ef eri is a brown dwarf - like object of spectral type near l4 - 5 , with t@xmath8@xmath11650k .",
    "however , we note that the 2.3 micron continuum break due to co absorption is not as strong as in the single stars gd 165b ( l4 ) and dns 1228ab ( l5 ) ( t@xmath8 = 1750 - 1550k , leggett et al . , 2001 ) .    the evolutionary state of ll and and ef eri can be considered by using the cv secular evolution code described in howell et al . , ( 2001 ) .",
    "the secondary star properties for ll and and ef eri can be modeled by considering an approximate orbital period for both of 80 minutes and examining both _ pre_- and _ post_-orbital period minimum cases .",
    "if we assume that either system is a short orbital period cv which has not yet reached the orbital period minimum , its secondary star would have a mass near 0.11m@xmath6 and an effective temperature of @xmath13100k , yielding an approximate spectral type of m5v .",
    "our ir spectral evidence disallows this possibility and favors ll and and ef eri as being very old cvs containing cold , low mass brown dwarf - like secondary stars with masses near 0.04m@xmath2 ( 42 m@xmath3 ) , radii near 0.1 r@xmath2 , and effective temperatures of 1300k and 1650k respectively .",
    "however , this mass estimate depends on the exact value of the orbital period minimum as calculated by hnr .",
    "an alternative method , fairly independent of the exact value or even the existence of the period minimum , is to use a theoretical evolutionary calculation of t@xmath8 vs. m@xmath16 and estimate the secondary mass from its effective temperature based on our spectra . using the effective temperatures determined above , both secondary masses would be near 0.055 m@xmath6 .    assuming",
    "that the absolute luminosity of the secondary star in ll and is a close approximation to that of a field methane brown dwarf ( m@xmath17@xmath114.5 - 16.5 ; leggett 2000c ) , we estimate the distance to ll and to be only 30 pc .",
    "this is far less than the lower limit of 346 pc estimated using wd models by szkody et al .",
    ", ( 2000 ) . to obtain a distance to ll and in agreement with the szkody et al",
    "estimate , the secondary star would need to have m@xmath18 @xmath110 . for ef eri",
    ", we estimate the secondary star as @xmath1l5 and taking m@xmath17=11.5 ( kirkpatrick et al . , 2000 )",
    "we find a distance of 42 pc .",
    "distance estimates for ef eri presented in the literature give d@xmath1992 pc but are based on not detecting the secondary star in optical spectra and assuming it to be m5v . using the beuermann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) limit of a @xmath20m9v secondary ( m@xmath17=10.5 ) and our same assumptions , the distance to ef eri would be estimated as @xmath066pc .",
    "given that the secondaries in post - period minimum cvs are likely to be only brown dwarf - like and no models yet exist for their detailed properties , they may have absolute magnitudes quite different from those assigned here .",
    "the secondary stars in ll and and ef eri are the first brown dwarf - like objects to be unambiguously identified in a cv and the first direct observational proof of the theoretical prediction by howell et al . , ( 1997 , 2001 ) that a unique type of sub - stellar , brown dwarf - like secondary star exists in very old cvs .",
    "these binaries are the equivalent of placing jupiter ( equal radius but @xmath150 times as massive ) where the moon is and having it orbit the earth every 80 minutes .",
    "if many post - period minimum systems ( ie . , toads ) contain similar secondary stars and if the duty cycle of actual mass transfer in such systems is low ( as it appears to be in ll and and ef eri ) , then the majority will spend time in deep quiescent states and be very difficult to discover observationally as they provide no hint of their true nature .",
    "searches may need to concentrate on finding essentially white dwarf - red ( brown ) dwarf pairs .",
    "perhaps detailed observations of currently known short period wd+rd or wd+bd pairs may reveal that some are , in fact , post - period minimum cvs in deep quiescence .",
    "the united kingdom infrared telescope is operated by the joint astronomy centre on behalf of the u.k . particle physics and astronomy research council .",
    "the authors thank the staff at ukirt , particularly andy adamson , chris davis , john davies , paul hirst , sandy leggett , and olga kuhn , for their enthusiasm and support of this project and their help with the observations .",
    "mark huber provided assistance with the october observations and paula szkody and john thorstensen communicated information regarding the optical nature of ll and .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for providing a number of useful comments .",
    "we especially appreciate the help given by sandy leggett who has provided a wealth of information on ir spectra of low mass red objects and also digital spectra for comparison .",
