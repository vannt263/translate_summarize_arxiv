    "ideal mhd is a model for magnetised plasma where the collisionality is low , so that dissipative effects can be neglected , yet where the charged particles still interact sufficiently strongly via the electromagnetic field they can be treated as a single fluid .",
    "the ideal mhd model is applied to a wide range of laboratory and astrophysical situations , where there are long periods of relative quiescence in which maxwellian particle distributions can be approached , interrupted by often violent transients .",
    "ideal mhd instabilities are thought to be implicated in the triggering of the sawtooth crash phenomenon in tokamak magnetic fusion experiments and flaring in the solar and stellar context , see textbooks such as  @xcite .",
    "the former is important as it limits the performance of devices ultimately intended to generate nuclear power , and the latter is implicated in the generation of solar magnetic storms which can disrupt terrestrial power grids , navigation and communication systems .",
    "both these topics are presently the subject of intensive investigation , magnetic fusion as the multi - billion dollar iter tokamak enters the construction phase , whereas multiple satellite missions are collecting data on solar and stellar magnetic fields .",
    "it is often mathematically convenient when employing ideal mhd , to assume that the plasma fluid is _ incompressible _ , but the reality in the above - mentioned situations is that the plasma density varies by one or more orders of magnitude over the region of interest .",
    "this work presents what is believed to be a novel , mathematically convenient formulation of _ compressible _ mhd .",
    "the equations of ideal mhd as usually formulated are well - known and are to be found in many textbooks , see eg .  @xcite .",
    "as explained there , the problem admits a variational formulation which is of great utility for practical stability analysis , and a functional hamiltonian formulation in terms of lie derivatives  @xcite , of great theoretical importance for understanding stability and evolution .",
    "more direct approaches to ideal mhd stability are also now used  @xcite , and the results presently to be described are more relevant to the latter school .",
    "the potential vorticity is the ordinary vorticity  @xmath0 of the plasma ( the curl of the mean flow  @xmath1 of ions and electrons ) , divided by the mass density  @xmath2 , ie .",
    "the possibility of combining the equation for the time evolution of vorticity with that for density evolution to give a simple equation for the rate of change of potential vorticity , was first realised for a classical fluid by helmholtz as described by  @xcite in the mid-19th century . in the mid-20th century ,",
    "waln , according to  @xcite was the first to realise that a mathematically identical relation governed the evolution of the magnetic flux per unit mass  @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnetic field . for _",
    "incompressible _ plasma , arnold & khesin  @xcite combined these results in late-20th century to give an elegant formulation of ideal mhd in terms of lie brackets of vector fields .",
    "the lie bracket is here the generalisation to arbitrary vector fields of the ` flux - freezing ' operator , ie .",
    "the operator which determines the advection of divergence - free ( solenoidal ) fields  @xmath5 and @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the novelty of the present work is to extend this formalism to _",
    "compressible _ mhd and explore the implications .",
    "in particular , the peculiar , coordinate invariant nature of the lie bracket makes it easy to generalise solutions to arbitrary geometry in some cases , both analytically and numerically .",
    "the next section contains a detailed mathematical derivation of the key formula .",
    "a discussion of the implications for analytic and numerical solution follows , and finally some important possible applications are summarised .",
    "in terms of the operators of classical vector mechanics , the lie derivative of a vector can be defined as : @xmath6 which will help explain the equivalence with the vector advection operator , the first term on the right .",
    "indeed , waln s result for magnetic induction in a perfectly conducting medium is @xmath7 introducing component notation for vectors in general non - orthogonal coordinate systems , as described in many textbooks e.g.  @xcite , it turns out that the jacobians thereby introduced ( of the co - ordinate transformation from cartesians ) , cancel among the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : liebr2 ] ) , so that @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the contravariant components of the 3-vectors  @xmath10 respectively , and the summation convention is implied .",
    "it follows that @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 $ ] denotes the lie bracket of schutz  @xcite .",
    "it will be now be proved that the equation for the evolution of potential vorticity in compressible ideal mhd may be written @xmath13 where the potential current @xmath14 . the customary vorticity equation in ideal mhd is @xmath15 where vorticity @xmath16 , and current  @xmath17 .",
    "when proceeding further , it is convenient and often physically justifiable , by a barotropic or isentropic assumption , to neglect the term in the pressure  @xmath18 , and if not , the resulting additional term is easily representable in general geometry .",
    "it follows that to establish the equivalence of eqs  ( [ eq : fullpv ] )  and  ( [ eq : vort ] ) , it is necessary to show that @xmath19 , where @xmath20    now , eq .  ( [ eq : thm ] ) is a vector equation , so validity in any coordinate frame implies validity in all , hence it is sufficient to establish the result in cartesian coordinates , where @xmath21 the curl term may be expanded using the identity @xmath22 where @xmath23 . setting @xmath24 , and expanding the resulting curl - cross operation , there is cancellation of the two terms from the lie derivative , leaving @xmath25 since @xmath26 , it follows that @xmath27 and likewise since @xmath28 , @xmath29 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : divm ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : divh ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thm3 ] ) , and expanding the last term as dot products , shows that , as required @xmath30 .",
    "the set of evolution equations is completed by mass conservation @xmath31 this does not involve a vector lie derivative , but , using the standard expression for the divergence operator in general curvilinear coordinates , it may be written @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the jacobian and the @xmath34 is the metric tensor , which upon introducing @xmath35 may be written @xmath36 provided that  @xmath33 does not change with time . like the neglect of the pressure term above , this latter inessential assumption is often physically reasonable .",
    "unfortunately , the ideal mhd equations are here completed by the two definitions of potential vorticity and potential current , which _ do _ explicitly contain metric information , viz . @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the above , @xmath39 is the alternating symbol , taking values @xmath40 , @xmath41 or  @xmath42 , depending whether @xmath43 is an even , odd or non - permutation of @xmath44 .",
    "finally , note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : induc ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcons ] ) together ensure that @xmath45 , only if initially @xmath46",
    "the new model system for ideal barotropic compressible mhd evolution consists of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullpv ] ) , eq .  ( [ eq : induc ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcons ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : defpv ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : defpj ] ) . the simplification of the first three has been gained at the expense of complicating the last two ` static ' relations .",
    "nonetheless , evolution equations are harder to treat numerically , because any errors in the discretisation tend to combine over time .",
    "moreover , it will be evident that problems solved in cartesian geometry will test all aspects of the coding of the evolutionary equations .",
    "thus , there is considerable computational advantage to be gained .",
    "there is obviously the concern that the magnetic field computed may not be accurately solenoidal , but this is an issue for many other discretisations also .",
    "the main difficulty is in the inversion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : defpv ] ) to give the velocity field  @xmath1 corresponding to a freshly evolved potential vorticity ( since @xmath47 itself is evolved , eq .",
    "( [ eq : defpj ] ) does not need to be inverted ) . however , this inversion , together with the computation of the irrotational part of  @xmath1 , is a classical hydrodynamical problem , and a variety of strategies may be found in the literature . on present machine architectures , introducing the vector potential for velocity then solving the coupled system eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcons ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : defpv ] ) by a pseudo - timestepping algorithm is probably to be preferred .",
    "similar numerical solution strategies were successfully employed in electromagnetics by the current author and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "vorticity formulations are common in plasma modelling as they are helpful in several physically relevant limits , and in particular , a vorticity formulation has been used successfully in nonlinear , compressible mhd  @xcite .    turning to analytic results ,",
    "first consider mhd equilibrium solutions with no time dependence and @xmath48 , implying @xmath49 .",
    "in the case of force - free fields , meaning @xmath50 , substituting @xmath51 in the lie derivative in component form show this is a solution provided @xmath52 , i.e. exactly the same constraint on  @xmath53 that follows from the solenoidal constraint on  @xmath5 and  @xmath54 when seeking the solution @xmath55 .",
    "hydromagnetic force - free solutions , with the additional constraint that @xmath56 , now cease to exist however , because @xmath1 is not solenoidal unless the flow is incompressible .",
    "moving now to time dependent solutions , interest attaches to the ` flux compression ' solution  @xcite , which is postulated on purely kinematic grounds ( i.e.  from eq .",
    "( [ eq : induc ] ) ) and which may be written @xmath57 for a compressible flow  @xmath1 with density  @xmath2 provided that @xmath58 . here , @xmath59 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath60 are the usual cartesian coordinates .",
    "this solution is of practical importance for fusion experiments , where external magnets are used to generate a time dependent flux designed so as to compress plasma ` frozen ' to it .",
    "it is easy to establish that if @xmath61 then @xmath62 , and so there are compressible mhd solutions of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuls ] ) , for 2-d solutions of compressible hydrodynamics compatible with an additional pressure gradient of this form .",
    "one possibility is illustrated in simple geometry in figure  [ fig : roll2 ] .",
    "the simple form of the new evolution equations enables a generalisation of the flux - compression solution to general curvilinear coordinates .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the following is not simply re - expressing @xmath63 in different coordinate systems , nor is there a loss of generality in choosing units for density such that @xmath64 .",
    "the obvious generalisation is to take @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , implying a 2-d density to ensure a solenoidal  @xmath5 , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : divh0 ] ) requires @xmath67 .",
    "the next step is to ensure that @xmath49 , which as may be seen using the coordinate form  eq .",
    "( [ eq : lieder ] ) , simply requires @xmath68 .",
    "similarly @xmath69 may be satisfied by a flow with @xmath70 ( note that @xmath71 is therefore allowed ) . from the ` static ' relations , it will be seen that a solution with @xmath72 independent of  @xmath73 is possible provided  @xmath74 . put in the language of differential geometry  @xcite , if @xmath47 is a killing vector , there is a flux - compression solution .",
    "further to explore the implications of this , introduce generalised toroidal coordinates  @xmath75 ( cf .",
    "@xmath76 as commonly employed in plasma physics  @xcite ) so that @xmath77 where @xmath78 it will be seen that @xmath79 as @xmath80  varies form a set of nested toroidal surfaces with major axis  @xmath81 .",
    "introduce helical coordinates  @xmath82 on each surface , so that @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and write @xmath85 .",
    "suppose that @xmath86 is rotationally symmetric about the @xmath87-axis and satisfies the grad - shafranov equation , ie .",
    "@xmath86  is a flux function for an equilibrium magnetic field , then the curves of eq .",
    "( [ eq : torc ] ) as @xmath88 varies at constant @xmath89  and  @xmath86 are equivalent to lines of the equilibrium field with helical twist  @xmath90 .",
    "( note that @xmath89 and @xmath88 need only be suitably periodic functions of the regular toroidal angles  @xmath91 and  @xmath92 . to define an equilibrium",
    "fully requires defining these functions , but this is inessential for what follows . ) the metric tensor in a coordinate system @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 taking @xmath95 and using suffix  @xmath96 to denote differentiation with respect to  @xmath97 , the components of  @xmath34 are straightforwardly calculated as @xmath98 and when @xmath99 is constant , @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "this @xmath102  coordinate system has been chosen so that the equilibrium field expected in the tokamak confinement device may be expressed as @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , but it will be seen that in general , the metric tensor does depend on  @xmath103 through @xmath104 . by inspection , however , in the limit when @xmath99 is large , @xmath34 depends only on @xmath105  and  @xmath106 .",
    "hence a purely toroidal field , ie .",
    "one tangent to circles about the major axis  @xmath107 of the torus , allows for flux freezing solutions .",
    "further , when @xmath108 is small , the @xmath109-dependence of @xmath34 is weak , so a helical field in a torus with relatively large major radius is also in this category .",
    "the preceding limits illustrate two of the killing vector solution symmetries  @xcite ( the third is simply invariance in a cartesian coordinate ) .",
    "other possibilities for new analytic solutions outside of @xmath65 are opened up when it is realised that the helical field considered above is just one example of the use of clebsch variables  @xcite to represent a solenoidal vector field as a single contravariant component .",
    "alternatively , the vector potential may be introduced , leading to an interesting calculus involving  @xmath110 , consistent with the fact that exponentially varying density profiles ( implying constant  @xmath110 ) are often studied analytically .",
    "for magnetic fusion physics , the above , new analytic flux - compression solutions represent a possible nonlinear development of interchange modes  @xcite",
    ". they would seem to represent an efficient and rapid means whereby mass ( and hence heat ) might escape from a discharge , hence might be implicated in situations where there is rapid transient cooling , such as the sawtooth crash in the centre of the tokamak discharge ( @xmath86  small ) , and elms ( edge localised modes ) in divertor discharges ( large  @xmath99  limit ) . the preceding section has also speculated that the new formalism could be used efficiently to simulate ideal mhd evolution of discharges in generalised coordinates , say defined by an arbitrary mhd equilibrium",
    ".    in astrophysics , observed magnetic fields usually exhibit a significant degree of disorder , so it is unclear how important the new flux - compression solutions might be , as they rely on at least a degree of coordinate invariance .",
    "it is speculated that , in stars with a strong internal toroidal field ( such as the sun is believed to possess ) , the rotationally symmetric solution might help model the convection pattern , accounting for the largely latitudinal variation of the solar differential rotation .",
    "regardless , it should be helpful that , in the new equations , the field geometry appears only in the state equations .",
    "it will for example , be simpler to generate more realistic solutions from symmetric ones by varying  @xmath34 starting with the unit tensor",
    ". this could be useful , say , for modelling sunspot penumbrae both analytically and computationally , since there the magnetic field is predominantly directed radially outwards in the horizontal direction .",
