    "is essentially linear .",
    "these dynamical regimes have been extensively investigated in disordered superconductors @xcite and , more recently , in films with periodic arrays of nanoengineered pinning centers.@xcite however , much less attention has been given to the dynamics of vortices in arrays of obstacles ( or antipinning centers).@xcite because in this configuration vortices are not trapped individually , it renders a very small critical current , which , in principle , has limited interest for applications . on the other hand a small @xmath1 allows for investigation of vortex motion in a much wider current range .",
    "moreover , vortices may be forced into meandering paths inducing strong lateral fluctuations that can give rise to novel dynamical phases .    in this paper",

    "evidence of density waves in vortex systems have previously been found in the context of current - depaired vortices and antivortices in clean superconductors @xcite and turbulence in superfluids @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the phenomena we present here are collective states of the moving vortex matter resulting from the interplay of vortex - vortex interactions and the friction induced by the obstacles .",

    "@xmath17 results from the superposition of all fms in the array ( fig .  [ fig.pot ] )",

    "therefore , @xmath2 typically ranges up to a few thousands of vortices .",

    "first , the vortex system is equilibrated at zero current via a standard simulated annealing scheme  @xcite . then",

    "time series and averages are calculated on an interval @xmath42 of typically @xmath43 time steps after a stationary state has settled .",
    "the main physical quantities are the center - of - mass velocity @xmath44 of the vortex array along the drive direction and its time average .",

    "the different dynamical behaviors are arranged in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig.vi]-(b ) . in general , for @xmath51 , all vortices meander through the potential channels leading to a linear ( flux - flow ) phase , which we call phase i. this phase has an effective viscous drag coefficient , defined as @xmath52 , approximately force independent and smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the meandering motion of vortices dissipates more energy as compared to the case of conventional flux flow .        above @xmath53",
    ", we observed a remarkable plateau in @xmath54 for long - ranged vortex - vortex interactions .",
    "this constant velocity state , phase ii , persists in a wide range of force values and ends drastically in a fully jammed ( @xmath49=0 ) state for @xmath55 , phase iii , or in a moving linear phase iv for larger @xmath48 . at even higher drives ( @xmath56 ) ,",
    "all vortices surmount the barriers leading to a new flux - flow regime ( phase v ) .",
    "phase ii dominates the diagram in the range of parameters studied . to check the stability of this phase with respect to the kind of vortex - vortex interaction",
    ", we fixed @xmath47 and run simulations for @xmath12 values down to 0.5 .",
    "as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig.vi]-(c ) , the plateau shrinks as @xmath12 decreases and is substituted by a smooth decrease of @xmath49 for @xmath57 . as we shall see below , this region of decreasing @xmath49 have similar properties to the plateau region of the @xmath58 systems .",
    "here we analyze phase ii in more detail .",
    "for simplicity we focus only on the vortex density @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.flux ] , we plot snapshots of the flux density distribution @xmath59 for @xmath60 ( long range ) and @xmath61 ( short range ) .",
    "the central panels correspond to density plots of @xmath59 whereas the panels on the right are flux profiles averaged over the @xmath62 direction , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "the left panels depict the snapshots of vortex positions in the areas indicated .",
    "these plots reveal a spontaneous breakdown of the vortex distribution when going from phase i [ panels ( a ) and ( f ) ] to phase ii [ ( b)-(d ) , for @xmath64 , and ( g)-(i ) , for @xmath65 .",
    "the resulting patterns comprise stripes of high flux density oriented perpendicularly to the drive direction and traveling at constant speed as soliton - like vortex - density waves ( vdw ) .    for long range interactions ,",
    "the waves have a peculiar triangular flux profile , which changes shape as the force is increased , and are intercalated by narrow regions of sparsely distributed vortices trapped by the cross corners . by carefully analyzing the dynamics in different regions of the sample , we found out that the left side of the wave is characterized by meandering motion of vortices , similar to the dynamics at @xmath66 ( phase i ) , while on the right side vortices will rather assist each other to jump over the barrier , which is the same dynamics found at @xmath67 ( phase v ) .",
    "therefore , a single density wave corresponds to a moving region where two distinct dynamical phases coexist .",
    "such phase separation was also observed for short range interactions , but not so clearly because in this case a density wave spans only a few lattice spacings of the fm array .",
    "in addition , the pinned vortex regions for small @xmath12 are considerably larger and increases with force , which is accompanied by a reduction of the mean vortex speed .",
    "a detailed analysis of the morphology of the vdws and its dependence on the driving force and other parameters is given in sec .",
    "[ sec.mf ] .    although the vortex wave patterns observed in our simulations are not space periodic , they do present time order . a convenient way to search for time correlations in the vortex density @xmath68 is by studying the power spectrum of its fluctuations , @xmath69 , with @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite we perform this task by recording the density @xmath68 integrated over a @xmath71 region of the film every other 10 time steps during a series of @xmath43 time steps .",
    "@xmath72 is then estimated by averaging @xmath73 over @xmath74 segments of the time series .",
    "plots of typical @xmath72 , for both short ( @xmath75 ) and long ( @xmath64 ) range cases , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] .     and @xmath75 ( a ) and @xmath64 ( b ) .",

    "are plotted as guides to the eye ( see text ) .",
    "insets : driving force dependence of the mean vortex velocity and the density wave velocity for @xmath75 and 4.0 . ]",
    "as it is clear in this figure , @xmath72 has a long @xmath76 tail for all drive intensities and interaction ranges studied .",
    "this high frequency behavior is associated with brownian noise resulting mainly from the meandering dynamics , where a vortex colliding with a barrier has to choose randomly whether to dodge left or right .",
    "the low frequency region of @xmath72 , however , changes dramatically from a flat behavior in phase i to a series of strong peaks in phase ii .",
    "these peaks correspond to the harmonics associated with the coherent passage of high flux density domains at constant speed .",
    "therefore , the power spectra provide an efficient means of determining the density - wave velocity : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the first harmonic frequency .",
    "we have calculated the wave speed for different force values both for @xmath75 and @xmath79 . for better accuracy",
    ", we calculate @xmath80 from a ( sharper ) higher harmonic @xmath81 ( typically , @xmath82 or 4 ) .",
    "the results are plotted in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] .",
    "remarkably , @xmath80 is always larger than the mean vortex speed for both kinds of interactions . for short - range interaction",
    ", @xmath80 increases with the driving force , whereas @xmath83 decreases .",
    "such high speeds of the density waves as compared to @xmath83 can be explained by the presence of slow moving vortices between adjacent waves .",
    "in fact , because vortices in a density valley are diluted , they can easily be trapped at barrier corners ( thus contributing to decrease @xmath83 ) until being catch by a wave front . in opposition , vortices in the density peaks assist each other to overcome the traps .",
    "put in another way , the vdws observed here are _",
    "anti - jamming waves _ self - assembled in a way as to avoid a full stop of the vortex flow .",
    "density waves have been observed in other classical many - particle systems , for instance , car traffic  @xcite , granular flow  @xcite and galaxies  @xcite , and their origin is still unclear .",
    "in contrast to the anti - jamming waves observed in our simulations , the density peaks in these systems are jamming domains intercalated by free motion regions .",
    "accordingly , their wave velocities are usually smaller than the mean flow velocity and can even become negative  @xcite .",
    "however , in all these systems , ours included , density waves can be understood as a dynamical , self - organized phase separation , similar to equilibrium pattern formation in systems with competing interactions  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of granular media flowing through narrow tubes  @xcite density waves form spontaneously and generate a spectrum of density fluctuations very similar to those presented here in fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] , in spite of the very different types of interaction in these systems and different nature of the waves .",
    "to understand how the vortex - density waves are formed and why they lead to a constant voltage regime for large @xmath12 , we propose an analytical model based on a mean - field analysis of eq .",
    "[ eq.motion ] .",
    "we start from the fokker - planck equation for the vortex distribution function at zero temperature and coarse - grain it over scales larger than @xmath12 .",
    "this procedure leads to the following equation for the vortex density @xmath84:@xcite @xmath85.\\ ] ] @xmath86 is the lowest order ( long - wavelength ) contribution of vortex - vortex interactions , with @xmath87 .",
    "this indicates that , as expected , a local flux gradient introduces an additional term to the local driving force , that is @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 is the coarse - grained force produced by the pattern , which can be understood as a drive - dependent friction force .    to account for a dynamical trapping mechanism similar to that induced by the cross - shaped barriers , we assume that @xmath90 represents a static friction in the range @xmath91 , for which no motion occurs . for @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    ", motion takes place and , accordingly , @xmath90 must represent the corresponding kinetic frictions @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "these properties can be arranged by modeling the friction force as @xmath96 , with : @xmath97    we proceed by assuming a one - dimensional density wave is formed at a given @xmath98 , with @xmath99 , and search for the conditions for such a wave to exist with a fixed shape and a constant velocity @xmath100 directed parallel to @xmath101 . in this case",
    ", we can transform into a reference frame moving with the wave , @xmath102 , and rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq.f - p ] as @xmath103 where @xmath84 is assumed to be a function of @xmath104 only and @xmath105 is the density gradient in the moving frame . to determine the shape of the wave , it is convenient to choose the position of the wave maximum as the origin of @xmath104 and analyze separately the regions @xmath106 and @xmath107 . further , for simplicity",
    ", we assume the wave is single - peaked and define @xmath108 , such that @xmath109 , for @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , for @xmath112 .    with the help of eq .",
    "[ eq.friction ] , we can state the following conditions of motion of the wave : @xmath113 where we used the fact that , for any @xmath114 $ ] , the positive slope on the right side of the wave rules out the possibility @xmath115 , whereas the negative slope on the right rules out @xmath116 .",
    "this naturally accounts for the dynamical phase separation observed in our md simulations and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec.dynph-vdw ] .",
    "a direct consequence of the above condition is that if the vortex distribution peaks up at a certain point , the corresponding bump can only turn into a traveling wave if the gradients in both sides of the bump fulfill eqs .",
    "[ eq.ineq1 ] and [ eq.ineq2 ] .",
    "subcritical bumps , i.e. those with @xmath117 and @xmath118 , would simply be trapped by the pattern . on the other hand ,",
    "an increase in @xmath119 above its critical value leads to an increase in the right side velocity while an increase in @xmath120 above @xmath121 reduces velocity on the left side .",
    "therefore , if the vortex distribution peaks up too sharply the wave will be unstable and will rapidly decay to a profile with gentler slopes so that the velocities on the left and right sides of the wave come to a common value .",
    "it is clear then that the condition for the stability of a wave traveling at constant speed and fixed shape is that _ the density gradient must be everywhere critical _ , that is @xmath122 this result is analogous to the build up of the bean critical state in the magnetization of hard type - ii superconductors , where the flux gradient ( induced by the external flux penetrating the material ) exactly balances the critical force induced by pinning centers . here",
    "the critical forces are exactly balanced by the overall driving force , which accounts for the applied lorentz force and the flux gradient .",
    "[ eq.critl ] and [ eq.critr ] describe a triangular shape for the density wave which switches its left ( right ) side slope from gentle ( steep ) to steep ( gentle ) as the lorentz force is increased from @xmath53 towards @xmath123 . to contrast this result with our simulation data ,",
    "we take @xmath34 and @xmath124 , obtained from the @xmath125 characteristic for @xmath60 and @xmath47 , and calculate the parameter @xmath126 for bessel - like vortex - vortex interactions , which gives @xmath127 .",
    "then , we calculate the critical gradients from eqs .",
    "[ eq.critl ] and [ eq.critr ] and compare with the flux profiles obtained from the md simulations for @xmath128 , 7.0 , and 9.0 .",
    "the results , presented in fig .  [ fig.flux ] ( b)-(d ) , demonstrate a good agreement between the numerics and the mean - field model .    to estimate the wave velocity , we first impose that the velocity in the left side of the wave ( @xmath129 ) must be consistent with the linear , meandering dynamics expected to occur for @xmath116 . for this kind of motion ,",
    "an increase in the drive leads to a proportional increase in the velocity , i.e. , @xmath130 .",
    "then , we notice that , from eq .",
    "[ eq.critl ] , @xmath131 . hence",
    ", the wave velocity does not depend on @xmath98 : @xmath132 this is in excellent agreement with the md results for large @xmath12 if one assumes that all vortices participate on a wave , that is @xmath133 .",
    "in fact , as revealed by the simulations , there are narrow , low - density regions of trapped vortices coexisting with the dynamical phases for @xmath47 and large @xmath12 .",
    "for that reason , @xmath80 is typically slightly larger than @xmath134 .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the limit @xmath135 a moving wave solution is not possible ( at least in the framework of the present model ) .",
    "therefore , a condition for the occurrence of vortex - density waves is that vortices interact with a potential which is able to trap them only when the applied current surpass a certain critical value .",
    "this is probably the reason why vortex - density waves have never been detected or predicted in , for instance , arrays of pinning centers . in these systems , in general , there is no moving phase preceding the pinned phase .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the mean - field approximation ( eq .  [ eq.f - p ] ) is strictly valid for vortex densities @xmath136 . in the simulations performed for @xmath137 and @xmath138 we have @xmath139 , which can be considered inside the range of validity of the model",
    "indeed , the main results obtained in the md calculations for these parameters were correctly reproduced by the mean - field approach . for @xmath140 , however , the vortex distribution is too diluted .",
    "in addition , in order to treat the interaction with the barriers macroscopically , @xmath12 should span several lattice spacings .",
    "for these reasons , the analytical results presented here are not strictly valid for short range interactions .",
    "notwithstanding , our simple analysis ignores the details of the barriers , taking into account only its main macroscopic properties .",
    "therefore , it can be applied to other barrier configurations , as long as their coarse - grained properties can be expressed in a way similar to eq .",
    "[ eq.friction ] .",
    "the dynamical transition between the vdw and jamming phases opens the possibility for an interesting application : the construction of an active device ( made of superconducting material ) exhibiting _ negative absolute resistance _ ( nar ) .",
    "the working principle of this device is based on the negative absolute mobility ( nam ) effect , which corresponds to motion in a direction that opposes the driving force , irrespective of the drive direction .",
    "this phenomenon was predicted to occur in the transport of a single classical brownian particle through a symmetric , periodic substrate  @xcite and was experimentally corroborated in a system of colloidal spheres in a microfluidic device  @xcite and subsequently in a josephson junction  @xcite . in the later , the phase dynamics , which can be mapped into the problem of a single brownian particle , lead to negative resistance .",
    "quite generally , the main ingredients for the observation of nam are : ( i ) a medium that allows easy motion of the particles at low drives and strongly suppresses mobility at high drives ; ( ii ) a fluctuating ( nonequilibrium ) force , for instance an ac excitation , superposed to the dc drive .",
    "the first requirement implies necessarily that , for a certain force range , the mean velocity of the driven system must decrease as the driving force increases , that is , negative differential mobility .",
    "this phenomenon have been experimentally demonstrated for vortices driven in superconducting films with periodic arrays of pinning centers at magnetic fields close to one flux quantum per pinning site ( @xmath141).@xcite previous numerical calculations have pointed out that such negative differential mobility of vortices near @xmath141 is a result of a transition from a highly - dissipative , disordered regime to a filamentary state with somewhat smaller but non - vanishing mean velocities.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.vi ] , the @xmath142 characteristics of the vortex system under investigation here do present negative differential resistance , in a broad field range , as a result of the transition from the vdw to the jammed state . here",
    ", however , the voltage drop corresponds to a strong suppression of vortex mobility , which , as discussed below , is a crucial feature for the observation of nam .",
    "here we demonstrate how the nam effect can be applied to abrikosov vortices in patterned superconductors in order to achieve negative resistance .",
    "we subject the vortices to a lorentz force @xmath143 , with @xmath144 and an ac amplitude @xmath145 fixed at a value chosen just above the vdw - jamming ( ii - iii ) transition , and measure @xmath49 , which is proportional to the dc voltage , as a function of the dc drive @xmath146 , proportional to the dc current .",
    "the ac term of @xmath40 provide the extra energy source required for the observation of nam .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.nar ]     in the presence of a sinusoidal excitation with frequency @xmath147 and amplitudes @xmath148,@xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 corresponding to @xmath152 , respectivelly .",

    "the vortex dynamics cycle symmetrically through phases i , ii , iii , and back , producing zero dc voltage",
    ". however , for small positive ( negative ) @xmath146 , vortices are most of the time in the pinned phase iii during the positive ( negative ) half - cycle of @xmath154 and always in one of the moving phases i or ii in the negative ( positive ) half - cycle .",
    "this leads to a net motion contrary to the dc force , that is , the mean electric field induced by vortex motion points antiparallel to the applied dc current , thus generating the negative absolute resistance effect .",
    "in conclusion , we studied novel dynamical phases of vortices in a patterned superconducting film . by molecular dynamics calculations we demonstrated , for a wide range of parameters , the existence of vortex - density waves propagating at a constant speed @xmath80 larger than the mean vortex velocity @xmath134 and essentially force - independent for long - range vortex - vortex interactions .",
    "the waves consist of well - defined regions of coexisting moving phases , where vortices assist each other to either dodge or overcome the barriers , and are intercalated by regions of trapped vortices .",
    "our mean - field analysis revealed that these waves stem from fluctuations in the vortex distribution induced by a highly nonlinear friction force .",
    "a density bump produced by such fluctuations turns into a stable moving wave when it reaches a certain critical profile .",
    "it is precisely this critical shape of the waves that results in a force independent wave velocity , thereby naturally accounting for the voltage plateau observed in the md simulations .",
    "we have also demonstrated the feasibility of a superconducting device which exhibits negative absolute resistance .",
    "this is achieved by exploring a combination of ac and dc excitations in such a way as to conveniently switch the system between the moving and fully - jammed phases .",
    "this prediction could be promptly tested using conventional transport measurement techniques on a nanostructured sample with a pattern similar to that proposed here .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that , given the generality of our mean field model , the main results predicted here can also be applied to other systems of interacting particles , such as colloids and pedestrians .",
    "an advantage of the vortex system proposed here is that interactions can easily be tuned . in typical nanostructured superconducting films",
