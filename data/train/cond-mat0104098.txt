    "since the recent discovery of superconductivity at @xmath4 k in mgb@xmath1 by akimitsu @xcite , much work has been devoted to uncovering the underlying superconducting mechanism .",
    "evidence for conventional , phonon - mediated bcs - type superconductivity @xcite is now abundant .",
    "a boron isotope effect has been observed @xcite , and photoemission measurements indicate the opening of a superconducting gap in the density of states ( dos ) with a narrow coherent peak @xcite .",
    "the gap seems to have predominantly @xmath5-wave character@xcite , and its temperature dependence follows the bcs prediction . as shown by raman@xcite , photoemission@xcite , and some tunneling experiments@xcite ,",
    "the ratio of the gap to @xmath0 is slightly larger than the bcs value , indicating that mgb@xmath1 is in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "as already suggested by some authors @xcite the large @xmath0 in mgb@xmath1 can been understood with simple , weak - coupling arguments : the density of states at the fermi level is large compared with that of an @xmath6-valent , nearly - free electron metal of comparable density ( @xmath7 a.u . , where @xmath8 is the volume / electron ) , and the phonons most strongly coupled to electrons around the fermi level are due to the vibrations of the light b atoms alone .",
    "this simple intuition , previously used to suggest a high @xmath0 in metallic hydrogen @xcite , indicates two routes for increasing @xmath0 : either ( i ) doping the b sublattice with lighter atoms or ( ii ) increasing the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath9 , without significantly diminishing the coupling to the relevant lattice modes .",
    "strong - coupling effects and electron - electron interactions can potentially diminish the transition temperature with respect to that expected from a weak coupling approximation , and therefore both require careful consideration , which we provide here . in this work we focus on possibility ( ii ) .",
    "in particular , in sec .",
    "ii we first describe our first - principles calculations of the electronic properties of mgb@xmath1 and related compounds , and then discuss the details of the mcmillan approximation to the eliashberg equations to evaluate @xmath0 . in secs .",
    "iiia and iiib we report the structural parameters , electronic band structure , and density of states for mgb@xmath1 as a function of volume , and for alb@xmath1 , cab@xmath1 , and nab@xmath1 at equilibrium .",
    "importantly , a small _ decrease _ in electron density is shown to _ increase _ @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "as an example of an empirical realization of this effect , in sec .",
    "iiic we consider the result of adding small amounts of either na , ca , or al to the mg sublattice , which in the case of na and ca , decreases the electron density , or , in the case of al , increases the electron density . for mg@xmath2al@xmath3b@xmath1",
    ", we find that t@xmath10 declines with increasing @xmath11 in accord with experiments @xcite .",
    "for mg@xmath2na@xmath3b@xmath1 and mg@xmath2ca@xmath3b@xmath1 , however , we find that @xmath0 could _ increase _ up to 53 k for an na level of @xmath12 or up to 52 k for a ca level of @xmath12 .",
    "we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "to investigate the structural and electronic properties of mgb@xmath1 and related compounds from first principles , we use a plane wave - implementation @xcite of density functional theory @xcite within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite plus vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite .",
    "our mg pseudopotential treats the low - lying 2@xmath13 electrons explicitly as valence states . for all calculations we use a dense * k*-point sampling ( * k*-meshes of 19x19x15 ) and a 37 ry plane wave cutoff ,",
    "these together converging the total energy to less than a few mev / ion .",
    "after all lattice parameters are optimized for a given volume , electronic densities of states are calculated .",
    "once the dos is determined , we estimate @xmath0 using the mcmillan approximation to migdal - eliashberg ( me ) theory@xcite .",
    "the me theory includes the dynamical properties of the effective electron - electron interaction ( and therefore screening of the coulomb repulsion ) by introducing the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath14 ; self - energy corrections arising from the electron - phonon interaction are also included .",
    "the me theory does not , however , include vertex corrections , since according to the migdal theorem such terms are smaller than the self - energy correction by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the effective electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 the average phonon frequency at equilibrium volume , and @xmath19 a characteristic frequency of the order of the electronic bandwidth ( @xmath20 ev ) . in the diboride compounds considered here ,",
    "the average phonon frequency is roughly 700 k , the frequency of the strongly - coupled e@xmath21 mode of mgb@xmath1@xcite ; with these numbers we estimate @xmath22 and therefore vertex corrections can be neglected .",
    "moreover the dos has a weak energy dependence in a range of energy of order @xmath18 ( @xmath23 60 mev ) around the fermi level @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and hence a constant density of states @xmath25 near @xmath24 is a reasonable approximation .    with these simplifications",
    "the solution to the eliashberg equations for @xmath0 can be approximated by the mcmillan formula ( using an estimate@xcite for the debye temperature , @xmath26 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an approximate static fermi surface average of coulomb interactions . using @xmath30 10 ev , we obtain @xmath31 ; this implies that @xmath29 is well renormalized , and that @xmath14 can reach a maximum value of 0.2 for large @xmath29 .",
    "although a more rigorous treatment of electron - electron interactions may reduce the value of @xmath14 with respect to the accepted value@xcite , in what follows we take @xmath32 , the conventional value for @xmath6-valent , nearly - free electron metals .",
    "changes in @xmath33 with volume will not have a considerable effect on @xmath14 , which , in these compounds , is a slowly varying function of @xmath33 near its limiting value .",
    "the effective electron - phonon coupling is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average over the fermi surface of the elements of the square of the electron - phonon matrix and @xmath36 is the atomic mass , and , in this work , varies with volume through @xmath9 and @xmath37 . in the following calculations of @xmath0",
    ", the dos is determined at each volume from first principles , and the volume dependence of the phonon frequency is taken to be @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the grneisen parameter and @xmath40 is the equilibrium volume ; the electron - phonon matrix elements and the coulomb pseudopotential are approximated to be volume and concentration independent .",
    "first - principles evaluation of the volume and composition dependence of these matrix elements@xcite , which will most strongly depend on proper treatment of the screened electron - ion interaction , is a formidable task for alloys and beyond the scope of this work .",
    "under standard conditions mgb@xmath1 crystallizes in a three atom , hexagonal primitive cell ; in it , a single mg atom is centered one half - lattice vector above a honeycomb boron network .",
    "the lattice parameters have been measured to be @xmath41  and @xmath42  at low temperatures @xcite , and we calculate @xmath43  and @xmath44  , in excellent agreement with these experiments and also with previous calculations @xcite .",
    "detailed discussions of the electronic structure of mgb@xmath1 have already appeared in a number of recent studies @xcite .",
    "two dimensional hole - like @xmath45-bands ( arising from intraplanar b @xmath46-like orbitals ) result in a flat dos with a prominent van hove spike .",
    "a three dimensional @xmath47-like band also weakly contributes to the dos .",
    "our calculated bands at equilibrium volume ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) support these views and agree well with recent studies @xcite .    to examine the effects of volume on the electronic structure near the fermi level , we optimize the structural parameters of mgb@xmath1 at several densities , corresponding to changes in volume of @xmath4830% , and calculate the energy bands and density of states ; the results appear in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the @xmath45-bands are largely nearly - free electron - like : their dispersion is parabolic near the @xmath49 point , and their overall bandwidth is comparable to the free electron value at this density ( @xmath23 15.5 ev ) . in addition , the bandwidth increases as volume decreases , scaling roughly as @xmath50 as might be expected for free electrons , and the nearly - free electron gaps at the zone boundaries grow with increasing volume .",
    "the weak dispersion of the @xmath45-bands along @xmath49a reflects their particular quasi - two dimensionality , decreasing with increasing volume ( and increasing @xmath51-axis ) .    the position and shape of these bands are reflected in the density of states appearing in fig .",
    "2 , which we find to depend strongly on the cell volume . with respect to its value at equilibrium",
    ", @xmath9 decreases by as much as 24% at the highest compression considered .",
    "correspondingly , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath9 increases as the lattice is expanded , contrary to expectations for a nearly - free electron metal . the dependence of the dos on volume is almost entirely due to the changes in the width and position of a considerable van hove peak ( @xmath52 ev below the fermi level ) , which originates from a saddle point in the highest occupied @xmath45-band at the m point .",
    "the decrease in bandwidth with increasing volume reduces the seperation between the peak and the fermi level , driving up the density of states .",
    "the singularity is further enhanced by an increase in two dimensionality ( due to the elongated @xmath51-axis evident in fig",
    ". 2 s inset ) , and a complementary increase in the primary fourier component of the electron - ion interaction ( evident from the larger gap at the zone boundary ) .",
    "because these @xmath45-bands are essentially two dimensional , they result in a nearly constant dos near the top or the bottom of the bands ( where the dispersion is most free electron - like ) ; their contribution to the dos does not change appreciably with volume , and indeed , the dos at each expanded volume takes on nearly the same value roughly 0.3 ev above @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "2 ) .    as a result of the apparent increase in @xmath9 for lower densities ( i.e. , larger volumes ) ,",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 should rise , and to verify this explicitly we calculate the transition temperature @xmath0 using eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "we first determine the electron - phonon coupling by requiring that t@xmath53 k at the equilibrium volume . using @xmath54",
    "k and @xmath55 , we find that a coupling value of @xmath56 is required @xcite , in agreement with recent estimates@xcite of @xmath16 between 0.7 and 0.95 .",
    "we then calculate @xmath0 for a range of volumes ( @xmath57 ) using this value of @xmath16 , with the results appearing in fig .",
    "a general trend is clear : at lower volumes ( positive pressure ) @xmath0 decreases , while as volume increases ( negative pressure ) @xmath0 increases , in accordance with the dos at the fermi level . the variation in @xmath0 does depend on the grneisen parameter , and for larger values of @xmath39 , @xmath0 can change quite substantially over the volume range considered here .",
    "for example @xmath0 ranges from 26 to 50 k for @xmath58 but for @xmath59 it can reach 79 k. a larger value of @xmath14 will lower @xmath0 : our estimate of @xmath60 62 k at @xmath61 with @xmath620.1 and @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) drops to 51 k for @xmath63 ( for fixed @xmath16 ) .",
    "as mgb@xmath1 possesses equal numbers of electron and hole carriers , we also note that correlated electron - hole fluctuations may reduce @xmath14 and increase our predicted transition temperatures@xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "hydrostatic pressure has already been found to decrease the transition temperature , with a slope in the range of @xmath64 k / gpa @xcite and @xmath65 k / gpa @xcite .",
    "extrapolating to low pressures from data at @xmath66 ( @xmath67 gpa ) , we find a slope of -1.2 k / gpa for @xmath68 , slightly lower than a previous calculation@xcite of this slope using @xmath69 .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is not experimentally known , and it is used here as an adjustable parameter @xcite ; we reserve its explicit calculation from first principles for a future study .",
    "while the large effect of volume ( and electron density ) on @xmath0 is evident , isotropic expansion of the lattice is generally not possible experimentally .",
    "epitaxial growth of mgb@xmath1 is a one possible solution , and recently , kang _",
    "et al._@xcite report the growth of high - quality mgb@xmath1 thin films on al@xmath1o@xmath70 substrates having @xmath4 k with a sharp transition width of @xmath71 k. using different substrates , structures with a larger volume might be realized , though with different @xmath72 ratios . a more direct method would be to replace mg with a larger ion .",
    "calcium , with an ionic radius@xcite of 0.99  ( compared to 0.65  for mg ) , would certainly increase the volume of the unit cell , as verified by recent first principles calculations @xcite . on intuitive grounds",
    ", sodium would be a particularly attractive dopant ; as suggested previously ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) it carries one less valence electron and would therefore add holes to the system ( hole doping ) . additionally , with an ionic radius of 0.97  , sodium should increase the unit cell volume .",
    "aluminum , on the other hand , adds electrons to the system and reduces the volume , and , again following intuition , small amounts of al have already been shown @xcite to decrease @xmath0 .    in what follows we study the behavior of @xmath0 for small amounts of ca ,",
    "na , and al in mgb@xmath1 quantitatively .",
    "important physical changes due to the presence of these dopants are first elucidated through calculations of the equilibrium structural and electronic properties of their hypothetical bulk ( mgb@xmath1-like ) hexagonal structures . in agreement with expectations based on the ionic radii and previous calculations @xcite , replacing mg with either ca or na _ increases _ the unit cell volume : our calculated volumes of ca ( 36.40 @xmath73 ) and na ( 34.11 @xmath73 ) , are 27% and 19% larger than that of mgb@xmath1 ( 28.63 ) @xmath73 , respectively . for comparison , we find that alb@xmath1 stabilizes with a primitive cell volume of 25.54 @xmath73 , 11% _ smaller _ than that of mgb@xmath1 and in excellent agreement with the experimental value@xcite of 25.58 @xmath73 . in both nab@xmath1 and",
    "alb@xmath1 the intraplanar b - b distance _ decreases _ , but by less than 2% ; in cab@xmath1 , however , the b - b distance _ increases _ by 5% . adding a larger ion increases the @xmath51-axis for both na ( by 22% to 4.30  ) and ca ( 15% to 4.069  )",
    "; in alb@xmath1 , however , the @xmath51-axis decreases by roughly 7% to 3.282  .",
    "thus by doping the mg sublattice and changing the @xmath51-axis , the two dimensionality of the @xmath45-bands can be either enhanced or diminished , and this will also have important consequences for the density of states near the fermi level , as we now show .    in fig .",
    "4(a ) we plot the dos of mgb@xmath1 and cab@xmath1 .",
    "mg and ca are isovalent , but according to the results of the previous section , adding ca should have a large effect on the density of states . indeed , cab@xmath1 would result in an @xmath9 of 0.981 states / ev - cell , an increase of 41% over that in bulk mgb@xmath1 . note the increase in magnitude of the singularity : the larger volume gives the @xmath45-bands more two dimensional character , and the lower electron density results in a smaller bandwidth .",
    "finally , we note that although the unoccupied @xmath74-states do weakly contribute to the density of states near the fermi level through some hybridization with the @xmath47-band , they have only a minimal effect on the @xmath45-bands .    in fig .",
    "4(b ) we plot the dos of nab@xmath1 , mgb@xmath1 , and alb@xmath1 . because na , mg , and al are heterovalent , we expect changes both in the number of electrons per cell and in the volume to have a profound effect on the density of states near the fermi level . in nab@xmath1",
    "the dos at the fermi level substantially increases , from 0.711 to 1.014 states / ev - cell ; in contrast , @xmath9 drops to 0.378 states / ev - cell in alb@xmath1 . by removing one electron ,",
    "the fermi level of nab@xmath1 is shifted downward relative to that of mgb@xmath1 and toward the van hove singularity arising from the two dimensional @xmath45-bands . as discussed above",
    ", the larger volume again results in a more pronounced van hove singularity just below the fermi energy , as in cab@xmath1 . in alb@xmath1",
    "the opposite occurs with respect to mgb@xmath1 ; the fermi level shifts away from a van hove peak that is now less prominent due to the increase in electron density and decrease in volume .",
    "the large increase in @xmath9 for both cab@xmath1 and nab@xmath1 clearly raises the possibility of a @xmath0 larger than that of mgb@xmath1 .",
    "indeed for the hypothetical cab@xmath1 we obtain @xmath75 k and for nab@xmath1 we calculate @xmath76 k ( using @xmath58 , and @xmath77 , @xmath18 , and @xmath14 appropriate for mgb@xmath1 ) . but the expanded @xmath51-axis and appreciable dos at the fermi level , of course , call in to question the stability of the resulting cab@xmath1 or nab@xmath1 lattice .",
    "neither compound , to our knowledge , has yet been synthesized . therefore , instead of focusing on bulk cab@xmath1 or nab@xmath1 , we concentrate on the electronic properties and transition temperatures of the alloys mg@xmath2ca@xmath3b@xmath1 and mg@xmath2na@xmath3b@xmath1 for @xmath11 up to 0.2 .",
    "previous calculations@xcite using supercells constructed from the experimental lattice parameters of mgb@xmath1 have been performed for large li and na doping fractions of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . to obtain a quantitative estimate of @xmath0 for small @xmath11 in the absence of experimental data and without resorting to large supercells ,",
    "we calculate @xmath9 from first principles using a simple rigid band model _ that also incoporates the effects of the changing density _ due to changes in the lattice parameters . to facilitate comparison with na and also test the validity of our results against existing experiments , we also consider mg@xmath2al@xmath3b@xmath1 .    to calculate @xmath0 , an estimate for @xmath9 is required for small @xmath11 . as we have shown , the dos of cab@xmath1 departs considerably from that of mgb@xmath1 .",
    "given that it is isovalent with mg , the foremost consequence of adding small amounts of ca for the density of states will be the increase in volume , though the change in electron - ion interaction will also have an effect , e.g. , through the contribution of a small @xmath74 state density near the fermi level .",
    "in contrast , the most important consequence of adding small amounts of either al or na will certainly be a rigid shift of the fermi level .",
    "but adding either al or na will also modify the electron density in two additional ways : first , as these atoms are not isovalent to mg , the number of electrons will change ; and second , the nominal charge of the metallic ion in the cell will clearly differ from that of mg",
    ". both will in turn affect the electron - ion interaction .",
    "the strong volume dependence of the dos has already been demonstrated above ; to illustrate the contribution of the electronic and ionic charge explicitly , in fig .",
    "5 we plot the band structures of nab@xmath1 , mgb@xmath1 , and alb@xmath1 _ calculated with the lattice parameters of mgb@xmath1 _",
    "( i.e. , for _ fixed _ volume ) . at first glance",
    "the bands are quite similar , differing only by a shift of the fermi level .",
    "small differences are present , however , and they result from changes in the electron - ion interaction , the electronic density , and the ionic charge . for example , in nab@xmath1 the @xmath47 band crossing @xmath24 ( whose constituent orbitals extend out of the b planes and closest to the metallic ion ) shifts upward due to the weaker attraction to the ion @xcite , requiring the @xmath45-bands to shift downward relative to the fermi level . in alb@xmath1 the attraction is stronger and the @xmath47 band shifts the opposite way .",
    "further , the gaps at the zone boundaries are largest for na and smallest for al .    in the following determination of @xmath9",
    "we explicitly include , as mentioned above , the effects of volume due to the dopant ion . as a working hypothesis",
    "we assume that the effects of the electron - ion interaction will be minimal , partially justified by the observed small differences in the @xmath45-bands ( which are most important to the dos ) when mg is substituted for ca at fixed volume .",
    "furthermore , for nab@xmath1 and alb@xmath1 , we also implicitly neglect the effects of the extra electronic and ionic charge and perform all calculations with an mg pseudopotential . in this context",
    "we note that further work on the impurity systems , using the virtual crystal or coherent potential approximations , would therefore be of interest . in order to include the effects of small dopant amounts on the average unit cell volume , we extrapolate linearly from the @xmath80 and @xmath51 determined for mgb@xmath1 to those of cab@xmath1 or nab@xmath1 , thus obtaining @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath11 is the doping fraction . for alb@xmath1",
    ", we make use of available experimental data , as we explain below .",
    "we then calculate the dos of mgb@xmath1 for a few values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and , if we are considering either al or na , we adjust the fermi energy by an amount @xmath83 so that the integral of the calculated dos is equal to @xmath84 , where the dopant valence @xmath85 is 3 for al and 1 for na .",
    "( when treating small amounts of ca , we simply take the dos at the fermi level of the expanded mgb@xmath1 . )",
    "@xmath0 is then determined in the manner described above , keeping @xmath86 fixed but scaling the electron - phonon coupling ( eq .",
    "2 ) with a grneisen parameter through the variation of @xmath37 .",
    "the variation of @xmath14 with volume and concentration is difficult to estimate quantitatively , particularly since although @xmath9 increases with increasing volume , the static coulomb interaction @xmath29 declines . for these reasons , however , we may expect its variation with volume to be small compared with the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "finally , in all calculations we approximate the electron - phonon matrix elements @xmath35 as fixed .",
    "table i displays the results of our calculations of the @xmath9 of mgb@xmath1 for lattice parameters corresponding to mg@xmath2ca@xmath3b@xmath1 up to @xmath12 .",
    "as expected , the increase in volume again increases @xmath9 , and , as can be seen from fig .",
    "6 , this increases @xmath0 . for @xmath59",
    ", @xmath0 can reach up to 52 k for @xmath12 , despite the fact that the total number of electrons and holes in each cell remains fixed . by calculating @xmath9 with mg ions only",
    ", we neglect changes in the electron - ion interaction , but these should not be important to the density of states near the fermi level , where the @xmath45-bands are most important .",
    "the stability of cab@xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) is of course questionable , given that ca and b prefer to equilibrate in the cubic hexaboride structure@xcite , but if it were possible to introduce even small amounts into the mgb@xmath1 lattice , an appreciable rise in @xmath0 could be detected .      in table",
    "ii we report dos and lattice parameters as a function of na doping fraction @xmath11 at the adjusted fermi level of mgb@xmath1 , @xmath83 .",
    "note that @xmath88 increases by 7% for @xmath12 with respect to @xmath89 .",
    "this conflicts with the calculations of medvedeva _",
    "et al._@xcite , who report no increase in dos at the fermi level at @xmath78 and only a 4% increase at @xmath90 in their supercell calculations without relaxation of the lattice parameters .",
    "failure to treat the effects on the dos due to the increase in volume is the likely reason for this discrepancy . in fig .",
    "7 we plot t@xmath10 as a function of na doping fraction @xmath11 for different grneisen parameters . for @xmath59 , a @xmath0 of @xmath2353 k",
    "would be expected for 20% na .",
    "although we explicitly considered the important effects of changing volume on @xmath9 , as mentioned above we neglect the effects of the change in ionic charge and the contribution of the reduced number of electrons to the electron density .",
    "conveniently these effects should be small and may even largely counterbalance one another , as follows . replacing the mg ion with na will shift the average position of the @xmath45- and @xmath47-bands with respect to the fermi level , as discussed above , but , as we have emphasized , @xmath9 is most sensitive to the van hove peak arising from the @xmath45-bands .",
    "although this electrostatic effect shifts the fermi level slightly _ away _ from the peak in the case of na doping , the larger van hove peak due to the increased two dimensional character should compensate .",
    "further experiments will play a crucial role in determining the feasibility of na doping , but our work nonetheless serves to illustrate the positive effects of increasing volume on the transition temperature , even for small na concentrations .      to examine the effects of small amounts of al on @xmath0 we use the lattice parameters and electron density measured by bianconi _",
    "_ @xcite ; we then calculate the density of states at the fermi level and @xmath0 as above@xcite , using an mg pseudopotential . from table",
    "iii it is clear that doping the mg sublattice with al decreases the dos at the fermi level , and as is apparent from fig .",
    "8 , the @xmath0 s we calculate reproduce the data quite well using a grneisen parameter of 1.2 .",
    "larger ( smaller ) values of @xmath39 shift the curves to lower ( higher ) temperatures but do not change the overall shape , which is dominated by the changes in the density of states . simply shifting the fermi level without changing the volume ( and therefore with @xmath58 ) results in a @xmath0 that overestimates the data considerably at larger concentrations ( by more than 3 k at @xmath12 ) . in the case of al",
    "doping the secondary electrostatic effect due to the increase in ionic charge would shift the fermi level toward the van hove peak , but as the doping fraction increases , the position of this peak is less relevant , since electrons first fill the @xmath45-bands , shifting the fermi level into an energy range dominated by the three dimensional @xmath47 band , whose contribution to the dos is significantly less than that of the 2d @xmath45-bands .",
    "thus the contribution from the changing dos ( via rigid shift _ and _ changing volume ) is evidently most important to @xmath0 for al concentrations up to 8% .",
    "the additional electrostatic consequences stemming from the increase in ionic charge and electron density are artificially absorbed into @xmath39 , but we expect these effects to be minimal for the reasons argued above .",
    "we have found here that the superconducting transition temperature is quite sensitive to the unit cell volume and in particular , increasing the volume should increase @xmath0 . for the isotropically expanded lattice ,",
    "the van hove peak from the two dimensional bands increases the density of states around the fermi level .",
    "the importance of this effect has also been demonstrated through calculations of three other @xmath6-valent diborides , cab@xmath1 , nab@xmath1 , and alb@xmath1 , and also through the alloys mg@xmath2ca@xmath3b@xmath1 , mg@xmath2na@xmath3b@xmath1 , and mg@xmath2al@xmath3b@xmath1 .",
    "additional small amounts of ca are found to _ increase _",
    "@xmath0 up to 52 k due to the increase in volume without valence change .",
    "strontium or barium , other possible dopants likely to increase the volume , would also be of interest , though low - lying @xmath74 states may play a more significant role near the fermi level .",
    "the presence of na impurities in small amounts is also shown to _ increase _ @xmath9 and @xmath0 up to 53 k , contrary to the theory of hole superconductivity @xcite .",
    "lithium is another possible hole dopant , but since we calculate the equilibrium volume of lib@xmath1 to be 8.9% less than that of mgb@xmath1 , the decrease in volume may compensate for the shift in the fermi level toward higher density of states , resulting in only a small variation in @xmath0 . doping with al",
    "is found to decrease @xmath9 and @xmath0 for small @xmath11 , and a rigid shift of the fermi level of a compressed mgb@xmath1 lattice results in good agreement with recent experiments . finally , we hope that this work will motivate experimental studies of impurities in mgb@xmath1 that decrease the average electron density .",

    "<S> the density of states and @xmath0 of mgb@xmath1 are both shown to be extremely sensitive to volume ; in fact the density of states around the fermi level is found to rise with increasing volume because of a prominent van hove peak . </S>",
    "<S> doping the mg sublattice with small amounts of either ca , which substantially increases the unit cell volume , or na , which removes an electron from the unit cell while likewise increasing its volume , shifts the fermi level toward the peak and thus both types of doping are predicted to enhance @xmath0 ; in mg@xmath2al@xmath3b@xmath1 , however , the combined effects of the additional electron and decreasing average unit cell volume are shown to decrease @xmath0 with increasing al concentration , consistent with recent experiments . </S>"
