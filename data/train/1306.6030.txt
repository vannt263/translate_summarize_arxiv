    "we will describe some recent work and present some new arguments concerned with orbit growth in particular .",
    "many but not all of the problems identified here are well - known .    the same questions make sense for group actions . given a countable group  @xmath10 , there is an associated space  @xmath11 comprising all pairs  @xmath1 , where  @xmath12 is a representation of  @xmath10 by automorphisms of the compact metric abelian group  @xmath3 .",
    "while our emphasis is not on any setting beyond  @xmath13 , one or two examples will be given to indicate where the theory has new features for other group actions .",

    ". an easy consequence of the type of constructions discussed later  and an instance of the type of question one might ask about the structure of  @xmath5  is that each measurable isomorphism equivalence class splits into uncountably many topological conjugacy classes .",
    "we have not included the equivalence relation that is in some ways the most natural in dynamics ( _ finitary isomorphism _ , essentially measurable isomorphism by a map that is continuous off an invariant null set ) because there is little that can be said about it beyond those examples where it is almost self - evident how to construct such a map",
    ".    we will also be interested in various invariants for  @xmath14 .",
    "the most significant of these is the entropy , @xmath24 where  @xmath25 denotes an open metric ball around the identity of  @xmath3 .",
    "a manifestation of the homogeneity of the dynamics of group automorphisms is that this quantity coincides with the topological entropy and with the measure - theoretic entropy with respect to haar measure ( see bowen  @xcite or  @xcite ) , and is therefore an invariant of any of the notions of equivalence above .",
    "topological conjugacy also preserves closed orbits and periodic points .",
    "this combinatorial data is all contained in the dynamical zeta function @xmath26 where  @xmath27 , with radius of convergence @xmath28    [ definition : handzetaequivalence ] for elements  @xmath29 write @xmath30 if  @xmath31 , and @xmath32 if  @xmath33 as formal power series .    the primary growth rate measures",

    "as we will see , for many ( in several precise senses , most ) examples the limit defining  @xmath40 will not exist , and a more averaged measure of orbit growth comes from the dynamical mertens theorem , giving asymptotics for the quantity @xmath41 where the expression on the right is simply obtained by mbius inversion , as @xmath42    in general , for an action  @xmath2 of a countable group  @xmath10 , the periodic point data for the action is a map from the space of finite - index subgroups of  @xmath10 to  @xmath43 , associating to each subgroup  @xmath44 the cardinality of the set of  @xmath45-periodic points @xmath46 there is an extension of the dynamical zeta function to the setting of  @xmath47-actions due to lind  @xcite , but it does not carry all the periodic point data unless  @xmath48 . some of the questions considered here have been studied for full - shift actions of nilpotent groups in  @xcite , and for specific examples of  @xmath49-actions by automorphisms of compact connected groups in  @xcite .",
    "several of the questions we will discuss involve adopting a point of view on what is a natural family of dynamical systems , and what is a dynamically meaningful notion of equivalence . in this context it is reasonable to restrict attention to ergodic group automorphisms throughout , and in some cases the more interesting questions arise if we also insist that the group be connected . from this point of view",
    "the natural starting point is to study automorphisms of one - dimensional solenoids , and much of what we will discuss will be concerned with these .",
    "a remarkable consequence of the work of markus and meyer is that all of these seemingly exotic one - dimensional solenoids appear generically in hamiltonian flows on compact symplectic manifolds of sufficiently high dimension  @xcite ( we thank alex clark for pointing this out ) .",
    "thus , despite the seemingly strange phenomena and arithmetic questions that arise here , the dynamical systems discussed here arise naturally in smooth dynamical situations .",
    "another reason to restrict much of our attention to one - dimensional solenoids is cowardice .",
    "in one natural direction of extension , the @xmath50-integer construction builds families of compact group automorphisms starting with algebraic number fields or function fields of positive characteristic ( see  @xcite for the details ) , and the arithmetic questions that arise become more intricate but are in principle amenable to the same methods in those settings .",
    "another natural direction is to simply replace ` one ' by  @xmath51 , and study automorphisms of  @xmath52-dimensional solenoids . in this complete generality",
    "the difficulties are more formidable , and this is discussed further at the end of section  [ subsectionsubgroupsoftherationals ] .",
    "the assumption of ergodicity is a mild requirement and avoids degeneracies  automorphisms of compact abelian groups can not be non - ergodic in dynamically interesting ways .",
    "ergodicity guarantees ( completely ) positive entropy , and the structure of compact group automorphisms with zero entropy has been described by seethoff  @xcite .",
    "deciding if  @xmath18 and  @xmath19 are algebraically isomorphic is not a dynamical question at all .",
    "the equivalence implies that  @xmath53 is an isomorphism of groups , so we are asking if the groups are isomorphic to a single group  @xmath3 , and then if the two elements  @xmath54 and  @xmath55 are conjugate as elements of the group  @xmath56 of continuous automorphisms of  @xmath3 .",
    "if the systems are expansive ( or satisfy the descending chain condition ) and connected , then the problem of determining conjugacy in the automorphism group is algorithmically decidable by a result of grunewald and segal  @xcite ( see kitchens and schmidt  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec .  6 ) ) .",
    "in general this can not be expected : if the group is infinite - dimensional then elements of the automorphism group in general correspond to matrices of infinite rank .",
    "[ example : torus ] toral automorphisms are conjugate if the corresponding matrices have the same characteristic polynomial and share an additional number - theoretic invariant related to ideal classes in the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial ( see latimer and macduffee  @xcite for the details ) .",

    "for example , if @xmath58 then it is easy to check that if  @xmath59 has  @xmath60 we have  @xmath61 .",

    "as we will see , for connected groups this notion of equivalence collapses to algebraic isomorphism .",
    "in fact there is a rigidity phenomenon at work , which means that in many situations not only does the existence of a topological conjugacy force there to be an algebraic isomorphism , it is required to be algebraic itself .
