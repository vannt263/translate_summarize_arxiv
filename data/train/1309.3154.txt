    "the wide angle search for planets ( wasp ) is a two site campaign in the search for transiting exoplanets ( ( * ? ? ? * pollacco et .",
    "al 2006 ) ) .",
    "each observatory consists of @xmath5  telephoto lenses mounted in a @xmath6 configuration . to date",
    "there are over @xmath7  million objects in the wasp archive .",
    "observations consist of two consecutive @xmath8s integrations followed by a @xmath9  minute gap .",
    "the entire observable sky can be visited every @xmath10  minutes .",
    "the short integrations , and non - uniform sampling , allow for a nyquist frequency of up to @xmath11  d@xmath4 .",
    "due to the observing strategy , observations of a single star can occur over many seasons , with the target sometimes appearing in more than one camera .",
    "this provides a long time - base of observations which can either be combined or split into individual data sets .",
    "we selected , using 2mass colours , over @xmath0  million a - type and earlier stars from the superwasp archive .",
    "we aimed to identify new pulsating systems with frequencies above @xmath3  d@xmath4 .",
    "such a frequency range allows for the discovery of new @xmath12  scuti stars , rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars and compact pulsators .",
    "thus , enabling a statistical study on potential frequency boundaries .",
    "we calculated a periodogram for each wasp season for every individual object  over @xmath13  million lightcurves .",
    "periodograms for an object are cross - checked for peaks at the same frequency .",
    "an object is required to have two or more concurrent peaks to be thought of as genuine .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up is sought for the most convincing candidates . for our northern targets we make use of the service mode on wht / isis and uk salt consortium ( uksc ) time on salt / rss for our southern targets",
    "* roap stars *    to identify candidate roap stars we require a target to show a single peak in the periodogram above @xmath3  d@xmath4 .",
    "this peak must appear in more than one season of wasp data to eliminate the possibility of spurious peaks due to noise . using this criteria we identify @xmath14  candidate stars .",
    "classification spectra have been obtained for these targets , confirming at least @xmath9  new roap stars ( e.g. fig.[fig1 ] _ left _ ) .",
    "+ * @xmath12 scuti stars *    candidate @xmath12  scuti stars are identified as those objects with multiple frequencies @xmath15  d@xmath4 and having their principle peak in multiple seasons .",
    "we have @xmath16  candidates up to a maximum frequency of @xmath17  d@xmath4 .",
    "spectra have been secured for photometrically interesting targets such as j@xmath18  ( fig.[fig1 ] _ right _ ) .",
    "@xmath19 of the targets for which we currently have spectra are pulsating am stars ( also see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smalley  2011 ) ) .",

    "the superwasp archive has provided a new approach in searching for stellar pulsations in the a - type stars . we have thus far identified @xmath9  new roap targets for further in depth study as well as highlighting over @xmath2  potential new @xmath12  scuti stars with periods shorter than @xmath21  minutes .",
    "the archive holds many more examples of pulsating systems which are yet to be exploited ."
