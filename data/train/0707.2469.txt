    "kinetic surface roughening of surfaces growing in nonequilibrium conditions has been intensively studied for the last two decades @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches make use of both discrete atomistic simulations and stochastic continuum equations for the evolution of the coarse - grained surface height @xmath0 .",
    "there is overwhelming experimental evidence that surfaces under general nonequilibrium growth conditions can develop scale - invariant correlations in space and time , which supports the hope of a unified theoretical framework to understand kinetic roughening phenomena from first principles .",
    "the aim is at identifying the various dynamical universalities of growth associated with different sets of symmetries and/or conservation laws .",
    "it is believed that only these basic elements largely determine the universality class and the value of the corresponding critical exponents . in theoretical studies attention",
    "is therefore focused on symmetries and only the most relevant terms ( in the renormalization group sense ) are expected to be required to describe a particular class of growth .",
    "universality classes of growth are generically represented by stochastic partial differential equations , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the height of the interface at substrate position @xmath3 and time @xmath4 .",
    "the external noise @xmath5 represents the influx of atoms on the surface .",
    "the function @xmath6 defines a particular model and incorporates the relevant symmetries and conservation laws .",
    "in particular , invariance under translation along the growth and substrate directions as well as invariance in the election of the time origin rule out an explicit dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath4 . very often",
    "the presence of nonlinearities in @xmath7 require the use of perturbative renormalization techniques to obtain analytical approximations for the critical exponents , which can then be compared with monte carlo simulations of atomistic models and experiments .",
    "a perturbative renormalization approach invariably provides the critical exponents as a series expansion on the parameter @xmath10 , where the critical dimension @xmath11 can be very high when compared with the dimensions of physical interest ( usually @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) . only in a few lucky cases some extra symmetries produce cancellation of higher order loop diagrams that results in a scaling relation between exponents to be exact to all orders in the perturbative expansion .",
    "more often than not , the case is that we only have approximations to the critical exponents valid up to a certain order in @xmath14 and a great deal of elaborated algebraic effort is required to improve our approximation up to the next order .",
    "this often makes direct numerical integration of eq .   an extremely useful and necessary tool as the most reliable source of precise values for the critical exponents .    numerical schemes to integrate continuum surface growth equations like eq .   in @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 dimensions tend to be unsophisticated . in most cases a straightforward finite - differences ( fd ) method on a lattice",
    "does an excellent job and provides highly precise values for the critical exponents , at least in dimensions of experimental relevance . in this approach ( see details below ) one basically approximates the continuous height field , @xmath0 , by its values on the lattice sites , @xmath17 , and derivatives by differences between neighboring sites .",
    "more clever choices of the discretization rule have been shown to be useful to obtain better agreement with exact properties of the continuum solutions @xcite , which could not be obtained by using a conventional discretization , like the nominal values of the continuum equation parameters",
    ".    however , the use of fd schemes sometimes poses some important problems @xcite .",
    "in particular dasgupta _ et .",
    "al . _ have shown @xcite by means of numerical simulations that discretized versions of commonly studied nonlinear growth equations exhibit a instability in the sense that single pillars ( grooves ) become unstable when their height ( depth ) exceeds a critical value . in some cases these instabilities are not present in the corresponding continuum equations , indicating that the behavior of the discretized versions is indeed different from their continuum counterparts .",
    "it is important to remark that this pillar / groove instability is actually generic to the fd discretizations of a large class of nonlinear growth equations , including the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite or the lai - das sarma - villain ( ldv ) equations @xcite .",
    "this is a puzzling result because the corresponding continuum equations are _ not _ unstable .    in many situations , like for instance in kpz ,",
    "the existence of this instability is of little significance for practical purposes and one can actually carry out a correct numerical integration by using fd schemes .",
    "the reason is that one is mostly interested in the growth from a flat ( or almost ) surface initial condition and common relaxation mechanisms do not favor the formation of large pillars or grooves . in these cases",
    "the instability is only realized if the initial condition is prepared in such a state that there is a pillar / groove of size above the threshold on a otherwise flat surface , which is highly artificial and usually uninteresting for practical purposes .",
    "however , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a large class of systems for which the instability of any fd scheme is inevitable .",
    "specifically , discrete versions of models exhibiting anomalous kinetic roughening @xcite will certainly show this kind of instability at sufficiently long times .",
    "the reason being that anomalous scaling is associated with a nontrivial dynamics of the average surface gradient ( local slope ) , so that @xmath18 , with @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "therefore , systems exhibiting anomalous roughening will dynamically generate large local height differences , no matter how flat the initial condition is . as a consequence ,",
    "provided that a simulation is run long enough , the surface will produce pillars / grooves above the critical value for the instability to appear , like for instance is the case for ldv .",
    "one of the models we study in this paper is the ldv equation @xcite @xmath20 where the noise is gaussian distributed and delta correlated , @xmath21 this model constitutes a minimal model for the long wavelength behavior of surface growth under ideal molecular - beam epitaxy conditions .",
    "the ldv model is interesting in many respects and has been the focus of a lot of attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of discrete versions of in @xmath15 dimensions have reported @xcite a finite , albeit small , anomalous exponent @xmath22 , possibly indicating a logarithmic dependence . a theoretical prediction @xcite based on flory - type arguments predicted @xmath23 ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , from the discussion above , one would expect a discrete version of to become unstable .",
    "this problem was studied by dasgupta _ et .",
    "and they showed @xcite that fd algorithms were actually unstable at long times .",
    "they also estimated the critical height step to be around @xmath24 with @xmath25 for with @xmath26 , which clearly shows that the instability will appear the sooner the larger the nonlinear coefficient is .",
    "those authors also found that the addition of higher - order nonlinearities in the fd version of the model controls the numerical instabilities and renders a stable surface , but with intermittent fluctuations and multiscaling properties of surface correlations .",
    "it has been claimed that higher - order nonlinearities of the form @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , may play an important role in ldv universality class because they are infinitely many marginally relevant nonlinear terms @xcite .",
    "these results can be compared with fd integration schemes for the kpz equation @xmath29    it has been shown @xcite that discrete versions of eq . were stable , unless isolated grooves of large enough size are included in the initial state .",
    "the reason being that kpz exhibits conventional ( no anomalous ) scaling and local slopes are thus rapidly converging towards a constant . under general conditions",
    "the constant is much smaller than the critical slope @xmath30 for the kpz discretization to become unstable and so , large slopes are not spontaneously generated by the dynamics .    in reference",
    "@xcite a study of the 1d and 2d kpz equation using finite - differences and pseudospectral integration methods is presented .",
    "authors claim that a pseudospectral method gives results closer to the continuum limit than finite - differences methods .",
    "they show how a pseudospectral method reproduces the exact value of the global width of the steady state interface within error bars whereas a finite - differences method with conventional discretization of the nonlinear term entails significant differences in the amplitude value .",
    "they also use pseudospectral computations to reproduce the most reliable values of the dynamical exponents obtained through discrete growth models .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the validity of fd integration algorithms in the presence of anomalous roughening .",
    "we compare the accuracy , stability and overall performance of fd methods versus pseudospectral ( ps ) schemes applied to the paradigmatic examples of the kpz and ldv equations .",
    "we claim that the instability previously found in fd discretizations is spurious and non physical , therefore , fd should be generally avoided in numerical simulations of continuum growth models with anomalous scaling .",
    "we argue that the main reason for the adequacy of ps to attack growth problems with anomalous scaling is that spatial derivatives are _ more accurate _ than in fd methods , where one implicitly assumes that the step height is small .",
    "our conclusions are based on numerical analysis of kpz and ldv equations in @xmath15 dimensions by means of fd and ps integration schemes .",
    "our results when comparing both techniques are conclusive : _",
    "( i ) _ ps methods are stable against isolated pillars / grooves , while fd are not , _",
    "( ii ) _ under the same conditions ps schemes take much longer than fd to get to a numerical overflow , and _",
    "( iii ) _ ps schemes give well behaved correlation functions with no trace of multiscaling .",
    "finally , we will discuss the implications of our results for the appearance of multiscaling in discrete models proved to be in the same universality class as ldv equations  @xcite .",
    "in order to perform a numerical integration of eqs .   and the parameters can easily be rescaled to have only one independent control parameter namely , the coupling constant . as it is customary",

    "one can see that , in order to reproduce numerically the slope distribution with the fd method , slopes must be computed with the forward ( or backward ) operator ( eq .  ) , so that @xmath190 .",
    "we have checked that if the symmetric rule to compute the derivatives ( @xmath191 ) is used the width of the slope probability distribution is far from unity , which is the exact value .",
    "when forward or backward derivatives are used , however , the correct value is recovered .",
    "remarkably , the ps method provides the proper result in a natural way .",

    "it has been argued  @xcite that with the improved discretization the correct value for the prefactor is recovered .",
    "a plot of @xmath195 versus @xmath196 was presented in references  @xcite , showing that @xmath197 is unity within error bars for both the ps method and the fd method with the discretization , although the dispersion of the data is larger for the fd method .",
    "we have also carried out a similar study comparing fd and ps methods .",
    "we checked that the curve @xmath198 _ vs. _ @xmath68 can be fitted to a function of the form @xmath199 , where @xmath200 for the fd method with the usual discretization . as expected , this value is clearly smaller than the nominal value @xmath201 .",
    "this observation is in agreement with that of reference  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for both ps and fd method with ls improved discretization we obtain the same value ( indistinguishable up to the third digit ) @xmath202 , a value very close to @xmath203 indeed .",
    "therefore , with the ps method we obtain in a natural way the result predicted by the continuum model for the steady state global interface width . for the fd method , on the contrary , we must use an _ ad hoc _ discretization of the nonlinear terms to achieve the same results .",
    "we have investigated the influence of the numerical method on the multiscaling behaviour of the ldv equation .",
    "the multiscaling can be detected by looking at the moments of the nearest neighbour height difference .",
    "we define  @xcite @xmath204 where the average is taken over each site of the system and over the different realizations of the noise . in systems that exhibit anomalous",
    "scaling , as the case of the ldv equation for intermediate times ( see note  @xcite ) , the moments @xmath205 are expected to grow as follows @xmath206 where @xmath68 is the system size and @xmath152 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "when the moments scale in a different way , that is , when the depend on @xmath207 , the system is said to show multiscaling .",
    "as done in  @xcite , we monitorize the multiscaling by looking at the ratios @xmath208 , @xmath209 . on the other hand , the multiscaling can also be studied by measuring the height difference correlation function  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : multildv]a we show the ratios @xmath208 with @xmath210 for the 1d ldv equation integrated with the fd scheme .",
    "parameter values are @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and the averages are taken over 100 realizations .",
    "this is in fact a reproduction of fig .",
    "12 of reference  @xcite . as can be seen in the picture , the greater the @xmath207 , the faster the growth of @xmath213 with time .",
    "this behaviour implies the existence of multiscaling . for times greater than 100",
    ", the evolution of the system can not be followed due to the presence of numerical instabilities .",
    "the authors of @xcite claimed that this behavior is related to an instability of the discretized ldv equation against the growth of isolated pillars , which are just height profiles such that the field @xmath8 is positive at a certain point while being zero otherwise . for",
    "a given a value of the parameter @xmath64 , there exists a critical value @xmath30 of the pillar height beyond which the pillar grows with a certain probability .",
    "it is found that this critical height goes as @xmath214 . on the other hand , the effect of the magnitude of the time step on this instability seems to be very small .",
    "for this reason , it is further argued in @xcite that this instability is _ not _ a numerical artifact due to the use of a not small enough integration time step . as we show in the following our results",
    "disagree with this interpretation .    , @xmath210 , as a function of time , of the moments of the nearest neighbor height difference for the 1d ldv equation integrated with the fd [ fig .",
    "( a ) ] and ps [ fig .",
    "( b ) ] numerical methods .",
    "here @xmath170 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and the averages are taken over 300 realizations .",
    "[ fig : multildv ] ]    interestingly , we find that the numerical integration of the ldv equation with the ps method has a significant impact on the observed scaling properties .",
    "the instability discussed above , which is present with any fd method , is no longer present , at least in the wide range of couplings we studied .",
    "specifically , a pillar like initial condition of the form @xmath217 never grows with the ps method . in the absence of noise ,",
    "the temporal derivative of the field is always negative .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to @xmath218 therefore , a pillar or the form always tends to shrink in the deterministic case .",
    "other structures like double pillars , however , might grow in time when their size exceeds a certain value .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : multildv]b we show the ratios @xmath208 , @xmath210 , for the 1d ldv equation integrated with the ps scheme . in this case",
    "we use a value of @xmath219 for which the nonlinearities are considerably stronger than for the fd method with @xmath212 .",
    "as it can be observed , the curves do not grow in time , which means that there is no multiscaling .",
    "for other values of @xmath64 and other system sizes similar results were obtained .",
    "it is worth mentioning , however , that the instability does show up when the aliasing is _ not _ removed . in this case",
    "an isolated pillar may grow when its height is larger than a critical value , in much the same way as with the fd method .",
    "so , it is strongly recommended to remove aliasing effects when applying a ps method to correctly describe the continuum physics .",
    "note that the aliasing does not actually affect global properties of the system such as multiscaling , the value of the critical exponents , etc .",
    "indeed , we have also carried out a study of the ps method without removing the aliasing because in this case a similar instability of the fd method is present .",
    "we have not observed multiscaling in this case either .",
    "we then conclude that the multiscaling does not seem to be related to this instability for the ps method .",
    "this analysis leads to the main conclusion of our paper that the existence of multiscaling may depend on the numerical scheme used to integrate the growth model .",
    "we argue that the instability ( and associated multiscaling behavior ) is intrinsic to the numerical integration scheme rather than to the discretization itself , in contrast with the conclusions of ref .",
    "our results clearly show that the instability previously found in fd discretizations has to be seen as spurious and inherent to the discretization scheme used .",
    "ps integration methods do not show any trace of either instability ( when aliasing is properly removed ) or multiscaling , representing much more accurately the dynamics and statistics of the continuum problem .",
    "we conclude that a ps method should be preferred for surface growth equations with anomalous scaling , because next - neighbor height differences in this case can grow very large .",
    "we have shown that the choice of the numerical method used to integrate certain stochastic models of surface growth may be of paramount importance in the study of some physical properties of the system .",
    "we have compared a standard finite difference method with a pseudospectral numerical scheme in the integration of the kpz and ldv growth models in 1 + 1 dimensions . as the fd method underestimates the nonlinear effects with respect to the ps method , the nonlinear coupling parameter were tuned up so that the nonlinear terms were of the same order for both numerical methods on average .",
    "the global critical exponents , obtained from the global interface width are the same for the two numerical methods .    with regard to the kpz equation",
    "there are some exact results available derived from the continuum model .",
    "the expression for the global width of the interface is known in the saturation regime . with the fd method and a standard discretization for the nonlinear term ,",
    "the amplitude of the width of the numerical interfaces is smaller than that of the continuum . with the spectral approach , on the contrary",
    ", numerical results are very close to the predicted value .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible with the finite differences scheme to get close to the continuum model prediction for the width of steady state interfaces , but at the expense of using more sophisticated discretizations .",
    "we have tested the stability of the algorithms by measuring for different time steps the probability of the system to undergo a floating point instability evolving from a flat interface .",
    "this instability is related to a numerical overflow in the surface height data .",
    "the ps method proved to be the most stable in all the cases we have studied for both models . in the same way , with the ps method it is possible to follow the temporal evolution of the system for longer times than with the fd method .",
    "the ldv equation exhibits anomalous scaling at intermediate times , so that according to  @xcite ( but see also  @xcite ) the average slope of the field is expected to grow in time .",
    "any fd method leads to a numerical instability against the growth of an isolated pillar appears .",
    "this instability has been claimed  @xcite to be the reason why approximate multiscaling is observed in the numerical simulations , although multiscaling is not present in the continuum equation . more importantly , this multiscaling has been interpreted as a real physical effect , which could explain the multiscaling behavior of surface fluctuations observed in atomistic models believed to belong to the ldv universality class .",
    "however , our results show that this interpretation is misleading .",
    "we have shown that surface multiscaling is not observed with the ps method , regardless of the temporal evolution of isolated pillars .",
    "therefore , surface multiscaling does not seem to be related to this instability for the ps method nor represent any intrinsic physics of the ldv equation as such . in this respect , due to the fact that discrete models can be mapped into continuum equations , in particular the ldv equation  @xcite ,",
    "our results indicate that multiscaling behavior observed in such systems could be an artifact of the discretization of the dynamics and , consequently , the are not intrinsic to the physical system they are trying to modelize .",
    "this anomalous exponent should be interpreted as an effective exponent according to recent theoretical results on the neccesary conditions for anomalous roughening in local growth models  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the effect at intermediate times ( before the truly asymptotic regime referred to in  @xcite ) is to produce a power - law growth of the local slopes and therefore instabilities of the finite - differences integration scheme as described ."
