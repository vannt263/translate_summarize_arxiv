    "recent work has shown that supermassive black holes ( smbh ) are ubiquitous in the centers of nearby galaxies .",
    "the observational evidence indicates that the mass of the central black hole is correlated with spheroid luminosity and mass ( e.g. , kormendy and richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) and also with the velocity dispersion of the spheroid ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggesting that the process that leads to the formation of galactic spheroids must be intimately linked to the growth of the central smbh .",
    "in addition , studies of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) hosts in the local universe with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have also shown that agn activity is closely related to star formation in local galaxies ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; heckman et al . 2004 ) .",
    "from a theoretical perspective , several groups have attempted to investigate the link between the cosmological evolution of qsos and formation history of galaxies within the context of semi - analytic and numerical models of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. ,  monaco et al .",
    "2000 ; kauffmann & haehnelt  2000 ; wyithe & loeb  2003 ; di matteo et al . 2003 ; granato et al .  2004 ; haiman , ciotti & ostriker 2004 ) .    in this paper",
    "we make a phenomenological investigation of the link between the growth of black holes and the buildup of their spheroidal hosts over time .",
    "specifically , we compare the evolution of the black hole mass density , @xmath7 , to that of the observed mass density of stars in galaxies , @xmath8 , and derive constraints on their co - evolution .",
    "to derive @xmath7as a function of redshift , we use the recently determined mass density of local black holes ( yu & tremaine 2002 ; aller & richstone 2002 ; marconi et al .",
    "2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "2004 ) , and evolve it back to @xmath9 using the observed agn x - ray luminosity functions ( see also merloni 2004 and references therein ) . the black hole assembly history gathered in such a way assumes that the majority of black hole growth is due to mass accretion and hence is a function of the efficiency associated with mass to ( radiative ) energy conversion .",
    "this provides directly the evolution of mass accretion rate density as well , given by @xmath10 .    to constrain the build - up of stars in the universe we use the independent measurements of the total star formation rate density ( @xmath11 ) and the total stellar mass density ( @xmath8 ) evolution .",
    "because current observations indicate that the black hole mass in galaxies is related to the spheroidal component , we will split up the observed @xmath8into two terms .",
    "we will hereafter refer to the mass density of stars in spheroids and disks  @xmath2  irregulars as @xmath12and @xmath13respectively .",
    "in addition to counting the mass contribution from pure spheroid , disk , and irregular galaxies , these terms also include masses in the spheroid and disk components of individual galaxies .",
    "estimates of the ratio of @xmath13to @xmath12at @xmath14 differ by more than a factor of 5 , ranging from 0.2 - 0.3 ( salucci & persic 1999 ; fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ; fukugita & peebles 2004 ) to 1.0 - 1.2 ( schechter & dressler 1987 ; benson et al .",
    "the redshift evolution of this ratio should depend not only on the rate of star formation in galaxies of different morphologies at different epochs , but also on the role of mergers , interactions , and secular instabilities in determining galaxy morphology .",
    "both from the theoretical and observational point of view , such an evolution has been so far very hard to quantify ( see e.g. baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ; van den bosch 1998 ; brinchmann & ellis 2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "2004 ; combes 2004 ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize and describe recent measurements of @xmath8and @xmath15 as functions of redshift . in section 3",
    "we derive the black hole mass density evolution using the x - ray luminosity function and the local black hole mass function . under the assumption that @xmath16 and that , at the same time , @xmath17 evolves as @xmath3 , we then compare the history of black hole and total stellar mass assembly in the universe and derive our global constraints on @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( section 4 ) .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarize and discuss our results and explore their implications .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a background cosmological model in accordance with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ) experiment .",
    "the model has zero spatial curvature , a cosmological constant , @xmath18 a hubble constant @xmath19 km s@xmath20 , dominated by cold dark matter with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( spergel et al .",
    "in this work we make use of all available measurements of the stellar mass and star formation rate densities from the literature .",
    "the stellar mass density , @xmath8 , has been measured in the redshift range from @xmath14 to @xmath23 from surveys that select galaxies by rest - frame optical or near infrared ( nir ) light and , in general , estimate the stellar masses and mass - to - light ratios of individual galaxies by fitting spectral synthesis models to optical - nir spectral energy distributions ( see e.g. brinchmann & ellis 2000 ; cole et al .",
    "2001 ; dickinson et al . 2003",
    "; fontana et al .",
    "2003 ; drory et al .",
    "one exception is rudnick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who have determined the evolution in @xmath8from the change in the luminosity density and the global mass - to - light ratio , the latter being determined by using simple models to interpret the cosmically averaged rest - frame optical colors .",
    "although cosmic variance is a dominant source of error for all but the local values , all support a scenario in which @xmath8at @xmath23 was a factor of @xmath24 times lower that it is today and that roughly @xmath25 of the current stellar mass was assembled by @xmath26 .    the measurements of @xmath8as a function of redshift also match well with the independently measured integrated global star formation rate density ( sfr ) .",
    "the sfr measurements are usually obtained from e.g. , optical emission line measurements , mir dust luminosities , sub - mm observations , or observations of the rest - frame ultraviolet light .",
    "these typically show a rapid rise of the sfr(@xmath27 ) out to @xmath28 where it peaks , followed by a roughly constant level out to at least @xmath29 ( see caption of figure  [ fig : fits ] for detailed references ) .",
    "for the most part , not enough information exists to empirically divide @xmath8and the sfr into different morphological components .",
    "however , when comparing these data with @xmath7(see below ) , it is necessary to take into account the fact that local black hole masses only correlate with the properties of their spheroidal hosts .",
    "we account for this by defining a parameter @xmath30 as the ratio of the mass in disks  @xmath2  irregulars to that in spheroids , in the following way :    @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{eq : lambda}\\ ] ]    we then assume that @xmath30 evolves simply according to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the value of the disk to spheroid ratio in the local universe . at high redshift , where irregulars contribute more to the stellar mass density , e.g. brinchmann & ellis ( 2000 ) , @xmath34 . ] .",
    "under the standard assumption that black holes grow mainly by accretion , the cosmic evolution of the smbh accretion rate and its associated mass density can be calculated from the luminosity function of agn : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the bolometric luminosity produced by a smbh accreting at a rate of @xmath37 with a radiative efficiency @xmath0 . in practice , the accreting black hole population is always selected through observations in specific wavebands .",
    "crucial is therefore the knowledge of two factors : the completeness of any specific agn survey , and the bolometric correction needed in order to estimate @xmath38 from the observed luminosity in any specific band .    in recent years",
    ", enormous progress has been made in understanding both of the above issues .",
    "here we refer to the discussion of marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who carry out a detailed comparison between optically selected qsos from the 2df survey ( boyle et al .",
    "2000 ) , soft x - ray ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) selected agn ( miyaji , hasinger and schmidt 2000 ) , and hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) selected ones ( ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) , and work out the respective bolometric corrections .",
    "the general picture that emerges is that the 2 - 10 kev agn luminosity function probes by far the largest fraction of the whole agn population .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that hard x - rays are less affected by obscuration than either soft x - rays or optical light ( marconi et al .",
    "it has also been shown that most of the obscured sources , which are the major contributor to the x - ray background light , ( see e.g. hasinger 2003 , and references therein ; fiore 2003 ) have typically lower luminosity and lie at a lower redshift than the the optically selected qsos .",
    "therefore , the growth of smbh ( and of their associated spheroidal hosts ) at @xmath39 is best estimated by studying the evolution of the hard x - ray emitting agn . at higher redshifts ,",
    "optical and hard x - ray selection give consistent results ( see e.g. hasinger 2003 ) .",
    "in the following we will indeed assume that the absorption corrected hard x - ray luminosity function of agn best describes the evolution of the _ entire _ accreting black holes population between @xmath14 and @xmath9 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will adopt for our calculations the luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) parameterization of the ( intrinsic ) 2 - 10 kev luminosity function described by ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the redshift evolution of the smbh accretion rate density can then be easily calculated as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the x - ray luminosity in the rest - frame 2 - 10 kev band , and the bolometric correction function @xmath42 is given by eq .",
    "( 21 ) of marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , that also takes into account the observed dependence of the optical - to - x - ray ratio @xmath43 on luminosity ( vignali , brandt & schneider 2003 ) .",
    "this in turn yields for the smbh mass density : @xmath44    for any given @xmath45 and bolometric correction , the exact shapes of @xmath46 and @xmath47 then depend only on two numbers : the local black holes mass density @xmath48 and the ( average ) radiative efficiency @xmath0 .",
    "given the derived @xmath46 above , we now want to investigate how the buildup of spheroidal mass in galaxies is related to the build up of black hole mass over time .",
    "we make the simple hypothesis that the redshift evolution of the spheroid and smbh mass densities are related by the expression : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is defined by : @xmath51.\\ ] ] for all reasonable values of @xmath52 , @xmath48 , and @xmath33 , @xmath50 is consistent with the expectation from the @xmath53 relation in the local universe ( merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; mc lure & dunlop 2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "then , from eqs .",

    ", we fix @xmath59 , implying that the stellar mass density in place then was formed instantaneously at that redshift . using the year 2000 version of the stellar population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 )",
    ", we have found a very good approximation for the function @xmath60 ( for @xmath61 yr ) in the form @xmath62 .",
    "with such a prescription , the fractional mass loss after 13 gyr amounts to about 30% .",
    "we perform a simultaneous fit to the observed stellar mass density and sfr points , assuming the functional forms of ( [ eq : ratio ] ) and ( [ eq : sfr ] ) above and calculating the black hole mass density evolution according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhobh_z ] ) and ( [ eq : bhar_z ] ) .",
    "we vary @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath0 over the range @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath64 $ ] , and @xmath65 $ ] respectively . in figure  [ fig : fits ] we show the observational data for both @xmath66 and @xmath67 , together with the best fit curves , in this case calculated assuming @xmath68 and @xmath69 mpc@xmath70 ( marconi et al .",
    "the shaded areas represent the 1-sigma range of models allowed from the joint fitting of both datasets .",
    "it is important to note that , for different possible choices of the local values of @xmath48 and @xmath33 ( see below ) , our best fits for @xmath8and @xmath15 are almost unchanged and always statistically acceptable , with @xmath71 values typically ranging from 43 to 45 , for 55 degrees of freedom .",
    "nonetheless , it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] that the best fit solution for @xmath8systematically overpredicts the observed points in the redshift range @xmath72 , where , however , cosmic variance plays a large role and the @xmath8measurements are quite uncertain .    also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] are the relative contributions to the total stellar mass density of @xmath12and @xmath13 .",
    "it should be stressed that such a decomposition is strongly dependent on @xmath33 .",
    "the _ relative _ growth in spheroids and disks  @xmath2  irregulars relative to their respective local values is in fact well represented by these curves , as it mainly depends on the value of @xmath5 , but their absolute growth , and hence the total mass density in disks  @xmath2  irregulars relative to that in spheroids at any @xmath27 , is highly dependent on the adopted value of @xmath33 .",
    "for example , if @xmath73 , the dashed and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] will be moved vertically to attain the same value at @xmath14 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ef_al ] we show the results as probability contours in the 2-d parameter space @xmath74 , obtained by marginalizing the total probability distribution over @xmath5 , assuming a flat prior on its distribution , to be conservative .",
    "the results are shown for two possible values of the parameter @xmath33 ( 0.3 and 1 ) .",
    "as it is well known , a constraint on the average radiative efficiency of accreting smbh can be obtained by comparing the total mass of the relic population with the integrated light from all agn at all redshifts ( soltan 1982 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi et al .",
    "given a reliable inventory of all the light emitted during the accretion induced growth phase ( here assumed to be given by the hxlf of agn ) , the final result will depend crucially on the value of the local smbh mass density : the lower @xmath48 is , the higher the radiative efficiency has to be in order not to over - produce the locally measured density of relic black holes .",
    "this is clearly illustrated by figure  [ fig : ef_al ] , that shows the calculated confidence limits assuming two different priors for @xmath48 .",
    "in one case , shown by the rightmost ( b ) contours , we have adopted a lower value as derived , for example , by yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) of @xmath75 .",
    "the radiative efficiency is constrained , at the 3-sigma level , between @xmath76 . on the other hand , if the local smbh mass density is as high as @xmath77 , as suggested by marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the radiative efficiency is allowed to take a lower value and is constrained , at the 3-sigma level between @xmath78 , as shown by the leftmost ( a ) contours .",
    "in fact , the range of allowed radiative efficiencies would have been larger than those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ef_al ] had we also considered the uncertainties on the measures of the local black hole mass density comes from a higher normalization of the m-@xmath79 relation by a factor  1.6 adopted by marconi et al .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this letter to discuss thoroughly the reason of this discrepancy .",
    "the reader is referred to yu and tremaine ( 2002 ) and to marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for such a discussion . ] .",
    "it is clear that there is almost complete degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath48 , once the luminosity function of agn is fixed .",
    "efficiencies lower than 0.04 are excluded at the more than 4-sigma level , whatever the prior on the local smbh mass density , provided that it is not higher than @xmath80 .",
    "this is easily understood , as black holes accreting with @xmath81 build up , in the redshift interval between @xmath14 and @xmath82 , a mass larger than this value .",
    "figure  [ fig : be_al ] shows the probability contours in the 2-d parameter space @xmath83 , obtained by marginalizing the total probability distribution over @xmath0 , assuming a flat prior on its distribution , once again calculated for two different values of @xmath33 .",
    "we note here that the constraints on these two parameters are almost independent of the adopted value for @xmath84 .",
    "the two sets of contours in figure  [ fig : be_al ] can be understood as follows . at low redshifts , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) , we see that the observed decline of the total stellar mass density , and the corresponding increase of the star formation rate density , will be driven by the term @xmath87 $ ] . for low values of @xmath27 ,",
    "this term can be approximated by @xmath88 , with @xmath89 , and fitting the low redshift points ( see below ) with this simple expression we obtain the relation @xmath90 , which indeed determines the approximate direction along which the best fit parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are allowed to move .",
    "as it is expected , the lower the value of @xmath33 , the less constrained will the parameter @xmath5 be .",
    "a constant @xmath30 ( @xmath91 ) is allowed at the 3-sigma level only if @xmath92 , but the best fit value always correspond to a negative @xmath5 , i.e. to an increase of the disk / irregulars stellar mass fraction with respect to the spheroid one with increasing redshift .    to further test the sensitivity of our constraints on @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath0 we have also performed a fit restricted to the redshift interval @xmath93 , where the observational data points are more numerous and have smaller error bars . in doing this , we have found that while the constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 remain virtually unchanged , those on the radiative efficiency are much looser . in particular , for high values of the local smbh mass density , we find that @xmath94 at the 3-sigma level . this can be understood because the constraint on @xmath0 comes primarily from the epoch in which the black hole accretion rate density is highest , which occurs at @xmath95 , where the qso luminosity function peaks . the data at @xmath39 do nt serve to strongly constrain @xmath0 .    in summary ,",
    "irrespective of all the uncertainties in the determination of @xmath33 and in the high redshift stellar mass and star formation rate points , the data do indeed put some constraints on the redshift evolution of @xmath96 . in particular , a constant ratio , @xmath97 is excluded at a more than 4-sigma confidence level , implying that the black hole to spheroid mass density ratio must have been larger in the past .",
    "it is well known that both agn activity and sfr decline at low redshift . moreover , the correlation observed locally between supermassive black hole masses and global properties of their host spheroids are suggestive of a fundamental link between the formation and evolution of black holes and galaxies .    in this letter",
    "we have attempted to constrain phenomenologically the joint evolution of supermassive black holes , their host spheroids and the total stellar mass density in the universe .    we have assumed that the black hole mass density evolution is due to accretion only and that it can therefore be reliably reconstructed from the local black hole mass density and from the redshift evolution of the hard x - ray luminosity function of agn / qso , with the ( average ) radiative efficiency of accretion , @xmath0 as the only free parameter .",
    "we have then examined the relation between @xmath98 and @xmath12 , assuming that the ratio of these two densities simply evolves as @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we have considered the simple case in which the ratio of the stellar mass density in disk components  @xmath2  irregular galaxies to that of the spheroid component of galaxies evolves as @xmath99 . by fitting simultaneously all the available observational data on the total stellar mass density and star formation rate density as a function of redshift",
    ", we have obtained a set of constrains on the three model parameters @xmath100 , which themselves depend on the local values of @xmath7 and @xmath101 .",
    "we have shown that the constraint we obtain on the radiative efficiency of accretion crucially depends on the adopted value for the local black hole mass density , but not on @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "more importantly , we have shown that bh accretion does not exactly track either the spheroid nor the total star assembly ( i.e. both @xmath4 and @xmath102 are larger than zero ) .",
    "this is the most important result of our study : irrespective of the exact mass budget in spheroids and disks  @xmath2  irregulars , the ratio of the total or spheroid stellar to black hole mass density was lower at higher redshift .",
    "the simultaneous fit we obtain for both @xmath103 and @xmath11also indicates that the black hole growth rate is suppressed with respect to the total sfr at @xmath104 , as it can be seen in figure  [ fig : fits ] ( as also shown in the cosmological simulations of di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "our findings have a direct _ observable _ consequences for the expected redshift evolution of the @xmath53 relationship : @xmath6 implies a larger black hole mass for a given host spheroid mass at higher redshift .",
    "we can also compare our results with recent semi - analytical work that tries to incorporate smbh growth and feedback into a galaxy evolution scenario . the simplest way to relate",
    "black hole mass and global galactic properties is via an energy argument , as discussed , for example , in wyithe and loeb ( 2003 ) : a smbh will stop growing as soon as the energy provided by accretion onto it at a fraction @xmath105 of the eddington rate for a time @xmath106 will equal the binding energy of the gas in the dm halo : @xmath107 here , the black hole mass is in solar units , @xmath108 is the eddington rate of a one solar mass black hole , @xmath109 is a coupling coefficient that can be determined from the normalization of the @xmath110 relation , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the matter and baryon densities , respectively , and @xmath113 @xmath114 are the mass and circular velocity of a dm halo .",
    "most of the feedback models in the recent literature ( kauffmann and haenelt 2000 ; cavaliere & vittorini 2002 ; menci et al .",
    "2003 ; wyithe and loeb 2003 ; granato et al . 2004 ) assume ( sometimes implicitly ) a linear proportionality between the quasar lifetime and the dynamical time of the dark matter halo in which it is embedded : @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is a weak function of @xmath27 and depends on the cosmological parameters only ( see e.g. ; barkana and loeb 2001 for more details ) .",
    "indeed , wyithe and loeb ( 2003 ) have shown that , if the qso lifetime is equal to the dynamical time of a dm halo , then the @xmath110 relation does not change with redshift , while the ratio of the black hole to ( spheroid ) stellar mass density should evolve as @xmath117^{-1/2}(1+z)^{-3/2}\\sim   ( 1+z)^{-1.15}$ ] , where the final approximation is valid for @xmath118 . comparing this with the constraints on @xmath4",
    "we have obtained in section  [ sec : results ] , we see that , although marginally consistent with these simple semi - analytical schemes , and only for the high @xmath33 case , the data clearly suggest a slower evolution for the spheroid to black hole mass ratio than that predicted by just assuming a constant @xmath110 relation at all @xmath27 . therefore , this would imply that the normalization of the @xmath110 relation _ should evolve _ with redshift .",
    "a caveat is however in place here , as of course @xmath105 and @xmath109 in prescriptions such as those of wyithe and loeb ( 2003 ) may not be constant , but vary as a function of black hole mass , or mass accretion and as function of redshift ( e.g. ; merloni 2004 ) .",
    "observational tests of the @xmath110 and @xmath53 relations at higher redshift ( see e.g. shields et al . 2003 ) will be crucial to our understanding of the interplay between black holes and their host galaxies .    finally , our results suggest that the fraction of @xmath8locked up into the non - spheroidal components of galaxies and in irregular galaxies should increase with increasing redshift .",
    "this result is consistent with brinchmann & ellis ( 2001 ) that show that the mass density in irregulars increases rapidly out to @xmath119 .",
    "if we relax the assumption that black hole mass and spheroid mass densities are related at all redshifts , then @xmath12and @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) would simple correspond to the stellar mass that _ ends up _ in spheroids and disks , respectively , at @xmath14 , where we know that black hole mass and spheroid mass are related . under this assumption , negative values of @xmath5",
    "would imply that the stars in local spheroids were formed at a later time than the stars in present day disks .",
    "this would directly contradict the relative observed ages of disks and spheroids .",
    "on the other hand , no such contradiction occurs when using our adopted assumption , i.e. that there is a @xmath53 relation at all redshifts and that @xmath12and @xmath13correspond , at any given redshift , to the mass in spheroids and disks  @xmath2  irregulars respectively .",
    "this further supports the idea that the dynamical events that lead to the assembly of spheroid stellar mass ( mergers , secular instabilities , gas accretion , etc . )",
    "are directly linked to the major accretion events onto the smbh .",
