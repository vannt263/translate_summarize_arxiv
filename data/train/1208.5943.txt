    "in the course of its evolution , the tidal interaction of a planet with the protoplanetary disc in which it formed is known to cause a significant change of the planet orbital elements . in particular",
    ", low - mass planets can experience dramatic changes of their distance from the central star under the process of type i migration ( ward 1997 ; tanaka et al .",
    "type ii migration concerns more massive planets that are able to strongly modify the underlying disc structure by creating a gap around their orbit ( lin & papaloizou 1986 ) . in that case , a planet undergoing type ii migration is locked to the disc viscous evolution and migrates inward on a timescale corresponding to the disc viscous timescale , provided that the characteristic disc mass is still larger than the planet mass ( nelson et al .",
    "+ the gravitational torque exerted by the disc on the planet and causing type i migration consists of two components .",
    "the differential lindblad torque results from the angular momentum exchange between the planet and the spiral density waves it generates inside the disc . for sufficiently low - mass planets ,",
    "the lindblad torque is well described by a linear analysis , which shows that the specific value of this torque scales linearly with disc mass and planet mass and as the inverse square of the disc aspect ratio ( tanaka et al .",
    "although its sign depends on the density and temperature gradients inside the disc , the differential lindblad torque is generally negative for typical disc models and is therefore responsible for inward migration .",
    "+ the corotation torque is due to the torque exerted by the material located in the coorbital region of the planet .",
    "a linear analysis reveals that the corotation torque consists of a barotropic part which scales with the vortensity ( i.e. the ratio between the vertical component of the vorticity and the disc surface density ) gradient ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 ) plus an entropy - related part which scales with the entropy gradient ( baruteau & masset 2008 ; paardekooper & papaloizou 2008 ) . a negative vortensity ( resp .",
    "entropy ) gradient gives rise to a positive vortensity ( resp .",
    "entropy ) related corotation torque .",
    "the consequence is that for midly positive surface density gradients or negative entropy gradients , a positive corotation torque can eventually counteract the effect of a negative differential lindblad torque , which may stall or even reverse migration ( masset et al .",
    "2006 ; paardekooper & papaloizou 2009 ) . in isothermal discs ,",
    "the corotation torque is a non - linear process generally referred as the horsehoe drag and whose amplitude is controlled by advection - diffusion of vortensity inside the horsehoe region . in non - isothermal discs , singular production of vortensity also arises due to the entropy discontinuity on downstream separatrices ( masset & casoli 2009 ; paardekooper et al .",
    "2010 ) and in that case , the amplitude of the corotation torque is therefore powered by advection - diffusion - production of vortensity inside the horseshoe region .",
    "+ in the absence of any diffusion processes inside the disc , vortensity and entropy gradients across the horseshoe region tend to flatten through phase mixing , which causes the two components of the horseshoe drag to saturate .",
    "consequently , desaturating the horseshoe drag requires that some amount of viscous and thermal diffusions are operating inside the horseshoe region . in that case , the amplitude of the horseshoe drag depends on the ratio between the diffusion timescales and the horseshoe libration timescale and its optimal value , also referred as the fully unsaturated horseshoe drag , is obtained when the diffusion timescales are approximately equal to half the horseshoe libration time ( see e.g. baruteau & masset 2012 for a recent review ) . in the limit where the diffusion timescales become shorter than the u - turn timescale ,",
    "the corotation torque decreases and approaches the value predicted by linear theory .",
    "therefore , the corotation torque can be considered as a linear combination of the fully unsaturated horseshoe drag and the linear corotation torque with coefficients depending on the ratio between the diffusion timescales and the horseshoe libration timescale .",
    "corotation torque formulae as a function of viscosity and thermal diffusivity were recently proposed by paardekooper et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and masset & casoli ( 2010 ) .",
    "+ so far , most of the studies aimed at studying the process of saturation of the corotation torque focused on laminar disc models with prescribed values of kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity .",
    "however , it is likely that both angular momentum and heat transport in protoplanetary discs occur because of turbulence probably due to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri , balbus & hawley 1991 ) and it is not clear how the disc turbulence really impacts the corotation torque . in the case of isothermal discs ,",
    "uribe et al . (",
    "2011 ) performed 3d mhd simulations of planet migration in stratified discs that suggested the torques coming from the corotation region can remain unsaturated due to viscous stresses in the disc .",
    "baruteau et al .",
    "( 2011 ) recently confirmed the existence of an unsaturated corotation torque and demonstrated that a horseshoe dynamics is indeed at work in turbulent discs with a weak toroidal magnetic field . using 2d hydrodynamical simulations in which disc turbulence is modelled through stochastic forcing ,",
    "baruteau & lin ( 2010 ) showed that in isothermal discs , the running time - averaged torque experienced by a protoplanet is in good agreement with that obtained from a laminar disc model with a similar vortensity diffusion coefficient , and in which the total torque consists of the lindblad torque plus the barotropic part of the corotation torque .",
    "+ in this paper we adopt a similar strategy as in baruteau & lin ( 2010 ) but focus on non - isothermal discs in which the horseshoe drag has an additional contribution due to the presence of an entropy gradient across the horseshoe region .",
    "the aim is to investigate whether the entropy - related horseshoe drag remains unsaturated in presence of turbulence and whether the running time - averaged torques in turbulent runs are in good agrement with a laminar viscous disc model with appropriate values for the vortensity and entropy diffusion coefficients .",
    "+ in the context of planetary population synthesis models aimed at reproducing the mass - semi - major axis diagram of exoplanets , it is of crucial importance to investigate whether in turbulent disc models the entropy - related corotation torque behaves as in laminar viscous discs since it may be responsible for significantly slowing down or reversing type i migration in the latter case .",

    "effects resulting from turbulence are modelled by applying the external turbulent potential @xmath18 of laughlin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( see sect .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. baruteau & lin 2010 ; pierens et al .",
    "2011 ) have shown that the perturbations induced by this stochastic forcing term have similar statistical properties to those resulting from 3d mhd simulations .",
    "in isothermal discs , it is well known that fluctuations arising from turbulence generate transport of angular momentum through reynolds and maxwell stresses ( e.g. papaloizou & nelson 2003 ) . for non - isothermal discs",
    ", additional turbulent energy transport is expected as a consequence of entropy perturbations .      to estimate the rate of angular momentum and energy transport resulting from turbulence , we adopt a common procedure and make use of averaged quantities .",

    "averaging the azimuthal component of the equation of motion ( eq .

    "this neglects turbulent heating , which is modelled in our simulations by artificial viscous heating at shocks arising from the turbulence ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : num ] ) .",
    "turbulent heating remains small , however , for the turbulence amplitudes considered in this study . to estimate the effective thermal diffusion coefficient in the simulations",
    ", we therefore simply neglect the turbulent heating term and make use of eq .",
    "[ eq : kappa ] .",
    "simulations were performed with the fargo and genesis numerical codes which solve the equations for the disc on a polar grid .",
    "these codes employ an advection scheme based on the monotonic transport algorithm ( van leer 1977 ) and include the fargo algorithm ( masset 2000 ) to avoid time step limitation due to the keplerian orbital velocity at the inner edge of the grid .",
    "the energy equation that is implemented in both codes reads : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the thermal energy density and @xmath37 is the heating source term by artificial viscosity and provided by shocks arising from turbulent fluctuations .",
    "this term is handled by adopting a standard von neumann - richtmyer artificial bulk viscosity ( see stone & norman 1992 ) with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 represents the number of zones over which artificial viscosity will spread a shock . here",
    ", no cooling term is included as an additional source term , which means that reaching a thermal equilibrium for the disc is not possible and that the temperature profile may be progressively altered by turbulent heating , especially in the case of strong turbulent fluctuations .",
    "however , from the results of simulations presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : withplanet ] , we anticipate that using a cooling term is not necessary since for most of the turbulence amplitudes considered in this study , turbulence heating has little impact on the temperature profile over the runtime covered by the calculations .",
    "in fact , not considering such a term enables to investigate effects resulting from turbulent diffusion only without continuously changing the temperature profile close to the planet .",
    "we further note that the results presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : withplanet ] may depend strongly on the expression employed for the cooling term .",
    "+ the computational units that we adopt are such that the unit of mass is the central mass @xmath40 , the unit of distance is the initial orbital radius @xmath41 of the planet and the unit of time is @xmath42 . in the simulations presented here , we use @xmath43 radial grid cells uniformly distributed between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 azimuthal grid cells .",
    "wave - killing zones are employed for @xmath47 and @xmath48 to avoid wave reflections at the disc edges ( de val - borro et al .",
    "2006 ) . + the initial disc surface density profile is @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 by default .",
    "for such a disc surface density profile , the initial vortensity - related part of the corotation torque cancels out so that the corotation torque consists only of its entropy - related part .",
    "the initial disc aspect ratio is @xmath52 with @xmath53 and where @xmath54 is the disc flaring index which is set to @xmath55 in this work .",
    "this corresponds to an initial temperature profile decreasing as @xmath56 with @xmath57 . for an adiabatic index @xmath58 which corresponds to the value adopted here , the initial entropy profile therefore varies as @xmath59 with @xmath60 . as will be justified in sect .",
    "[ sec : withplanet ] , such a positive gradient for the initial entropy profile is chosen to minimize the maximum convergence time of the turbulent runs , since both the entropy - related corotation torque and the differential lindblad torque are negative in that case .    in the simulations presented here",

    "<S> , the corotation torque therefore behaves similarly as in laminar viscous discs and can be responsible for significantly slowing down or reversing type i migration .    </S>",
