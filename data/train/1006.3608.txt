    "the selenium and germanium isotopic chains exhibit a complex nuclear structure and have long been a rich testing ground for nuclear structure models .",

    "on the other side of the nuclear chart , the most neutron - rich selenium and germanium isotopes accessible for experiments are around the magic neutron number @xmath0 .",
    "considerable experimental and theoretical efforts have recently been focused in this region on the investigation of the shell structure approaching the doubly - magic nucleus , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the description of nuclei in this region poses a challenge for shell - model calculations since the full @xmath5 shell and the neutron @xmath6 intruder orbital would be needed with the corresponding effective interaction .",

    ". measured @xmath11 electric quadrupole excitation strengths along line of @xmath0 isotones are compared to large - scale shell - model calculations with three different effective interactions .",
