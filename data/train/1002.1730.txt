    "this paper explores how mixing is affected by adding high molecular weight polymers to electro - osmotically pumped microflows . adding low concentrations of polymer to fluids moderately increases viscosity and dramatically increases elasticity , allowing microflows to undergo viscoelastic instability .",
    "based on the relatively small increase in viscosity , the striking qualitative change in stability , and early experiments that demonstrate up to orders of magnitude improvement in mixing there is an expectation of dramatic increase in mixing by incorporation of polymers . by excluding shear , present in all mechanically pumped cavity flows",
    ", we find that contrary to such expectations absolute mixing is reduced by adding polymer to induce viscoelastic instability .",
    "our findings demonstrate that viscoelastic instabilities do not , in themselves , promote mixing and suggest that electro - osmotic flows are an ideal platform for isolating and studying behavior of viscoelastic instabilities and elastic turbulence .",
    "viscoelastic flows are of practical interest for lab on a chip applications as many biological materials of interest for biomedical testing , such as saliva @xcite and blood @xcite , are viscoelastic in nature as are many other suspensions @xcite .",
    "several devices sort particles using laminar flow interactions @xcite , suggesting that viscoelastic induced instabilities can have potential undesirable effects as more concentrated and complex fluids are investigated ; it has already been noted that viscoelasticity in saliva testing negatively effects performance @xcite .",
    "in addition to the detrimental effects of instabilities there is suggestion that enhanced mixing may occur by intentionally spiking samples with polymers @xcite , thereby causing instability and subsequently increased mixing . as chemical reaction rate and completion",
    "depends on good mixing and as many clinical , environmental , pharmaceutical , and other diagnostic applications require rapid and complete reactions , in particular in the presence of small concentrations of sample , efficient mixing is an important aspect to device performance .    in microfluidic devices the scales involved ( typically o(100 ) @xmath0 m )",
    "are such that diffusive processes are slow , yet inertial fluid instabilities are suppressed due to the small scales leading to small reynolds numbers .",
    "this intermediate  slow scale \" regime makes mixing a key issue in microfluidics @xcite and various methods have been investigated in order to enhance mixing , including using bubbles @xcite , electrohydrodynamic instability @xcite , flow focusing @xcite , and bas - relief patterning @xcite .",
    "these approaches generally rely on creating inhomogeneities to the working fluid or the microchannels .",
    "viscoelastic fluids can exhibit flow instabilities @xcite when polymer coils stretch and bend along stream lines which creates hoop - stress , allowing polymers to cross steam lines and thereby disrupting laminar flow @xcite .",
    "these viscoelastic instabilities progress to elastic turbulence @xcite , a recently established turbulence that arises from elastic effects that can be excited at arbitrarily low reynolds numbers .",
    "use of viscoelastic fluids to promote mixing has been demonstrated in both microscaled dean flows @xcite , where chaotic flow was established and where earlier study of a macroscaled version of the serpentine flow geometry demonstrated true elastic turbulence @xcite .",
    "the establishment of viscoelastic turbulence @xcite and efficient mixing @xcite along with favorable scaling properties of viscoelastic instabilities , which become easier to excite with reducing dimensions , suggests that the use of viscoelastic fluids may be a promising route to promote mixing in microfluidic devices .",
    "furthermore , it is well know that solution viscosity increases with polymer concentration and at the overlap concentration , where neighboring coils impinge on each other , viscosity is only double that of the polymer - free solution @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this relatively mild quantitative change in viscosity ( and thus decrease in diffusion ) elasticity effects have dramatic qualitative impact with polymer concentrations as low as @xmath1 10 ppm leading to both large drag reduction in high reynolds number hydrodynamic turbulent flows @xcite and sizable instability and elastic turbulence in low reynolds number flows @xcite .",
    "several studies ( see , for example , @xcite ) have found that viscoelastic instabilities can be excited in microdevices , however additional deformations of the flows - most notably shear - exists in prior work and highly viscous solvents are used , which is atypical for many lab on a chip applications .",
    "here we use electro - osmotic flow ( eof ) in order to exclude shear and solely induce elongational viscoelastic instabilities by driving low viscosity fluids through sudden 2:1 constrictions in linear microchannels ; we compare mixing in unsteady viscoelastic flows relative to mixing in polymer - free solutions in order to measure mixing effects .",
    "mechanically driven cavity flows always have a significant shear component to the flow due to no - slip conditions .",
    "in contrast eof has effective slip boundary conditions and shear is confined to the debye layer close to the channel boundary @xcite ; flows are shear - free external to the debye layer as the electric fields that the flow follows are purely elongational @xcite .",
    "further , for large polymers , entropic repulsion from the walls reduces interactions of the debye shear regime with polymers @xcite .",
    "our pumping scheme therefore excludes the shear component that is ubiquitous to mechanically pumped flows .",
    "in addition to deformations caused by shearing there are possible lagrangian chaos effects @xcite , where flow fields result in chaotic trajectories which can lead to rapid mixing .",
    "we stack identical constriction units equally spaced down a microchannel , imposing symmetry as to reduce possible lagrangian chaos effects @xcite .",

    "we electro - osmotically drive fluids from the top and bottom wells to the left side well .",
    "fluid in the top well contains fluorescent dye , and mixing is optically observed by exciting the dye with an external 532 nm laser and collecting video data .",
    "each 100:200 @xmath0 m constriction / expansion unit creates extensional flow which induces instabilities in viscoelastic fluids with high enough deborah number . due to the slip conditions of electro - osmotic flow and symmetry non - viscoelastic instability mixing mechanisms are minimized .",
    "we find flow rates are not affected by the presence of polymer in the dilute regime and drive all flows with a voltage of 200 v , resulting in equal flow rates and comparable flows . ]",
    "@xcite were we demonstrate viscoelastic instabilitites under steady electro - osmotic pumping and discuss our device in more detail .",

    "fluid flow details are captured using a a casio exilim ex - f1 camera in video mode ( 30 fps ) , by attaching the camera to the @xmath0tk via a custom machined attachment and a scoptronix maxview plus optical adaptor ( camera - microscope attachment ) .",

    "our flow velocities are on the order of mm / s , and re @xmath10 1 , as is typical of standard eof microflows .",
    "addition of polymer allows elastic effects to induce instabilities for sufficiently high deborah number de above the instability threshold ( @xmath11 1/2 for elongational flows @xcite ) , the dimensionless number that characterizes viscoleastic flows .",

    "there is therefore a tradeoff involved in adding polymer to the solution which will allow viscoelastic instabilities yet reduces diffusion . by measuring mixing ( m1 ) in the second expansion",
    "we find that mixing is reduced as concentration is increased ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mix_c ] ) , demonstrating that the effect of instabilities in promoting mixing is not dominant for mixing our dye . as our dye is a small molecule ( @xmath22 nm hydrodynamic diameter @xcite ) our mixing experiments is a stringent - but realistic - test .",

    "the mixing index slowly raises with concentration in the dilute regime ; this indicates that while instabilities are promoted by the presence of polymers _ absolute _ mixing is reduced ( diffusion is hindered by the presence of polymers ) .",

    "we have shown that viscoelastic instabilities alone will not lead to rapid mixing , in contrast to earlier studies @xcite that found up to orders of magnitude improvement in mixing for mechanically driven channel flow . however , significant shear stretching is present in most prior work due to no - slip conditions . in a study of electrokinetic driven 2d sheet flow",
    "@xcite , which also excludes no - slip induced shear , viscoelasticity was found to mildly suppress mixing for flows below the instability threshold , a finding that is consistent with other studies that find either mild increase @xcite or decrease @xcite in this regime where polymers are only weakly distorted .",
    "additionally , in ref . @xcite they show that above the instability threshold stretching fields are reduced in viscoelastic fluids . by comparing a newtonian and a highly shear - thinning / viscoelastic fluid",
    "they find enhanced stretching and mixing for the shear - thinning / viscoelastic fluid , indicating that mixing trends are correlated to stretching field magnitude .",
    "our finding of reduced mixing , combined with the reduced stretching fields observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , shows the correlation between stretching fields and mixing holds for viscoelastic fluids above the instability threshold .",
    "our results which demonstrate reduced mixing in unstable viscoelastic flows are consistent with the understanding that viscoelastic fluids driven well above the viscoelastic instability threshold progress towards elastic turbulence which has been shown to be a realization of batchelor turbulence @xcite .    in batchelor turbulence",
    "it has been established that the velocity spectrum decays rapidly ( the wavenumber @xmath27 scales as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 has experimentally been found to be in the range 3.3 to 3.6 @xcite ) which leads to weak coupling between scales , in sharp contrast to high reynolds number turbulence , and the resulting flows are random in time yet spatially smooth and strongly correlated on the integral scale @xcite .",
    "this results in instabilities dominated by large scale fluctuations , which are set by the system size @xcite , and therefore there will remain a mismatch between the smallest scale one wants homogeneity on and the instability which is intended to drive mixing .",
    "note that the smooth flow characteristics of batchelor turbulence are consistent with our observations ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : photo_ex_con ] ) and , without some other mechanism ( such as shear ) to further modify flow , are at odds with enhanced mixing .    to create efficient mixing a bridge",
    "is needed between the relatively large scale set by viscoelastic instabilities and the smallest scales over which homogeneity is required ; diffusion , lagrangian chaos , or deformations such as shear can bridge these scales . in the  knead and fold \" metaphor of mixing @xcite viscoelastic instabilities can provide the fold operation that creates large deformations of material to create striations of dis - similiar material , however additional deformations are needed to thin striations allowing diffusion to finally homogenize the fluids .",
    "in summary , the addition of high molecular weight polyacrylamide to liquids leads to striking viscoelastic instabilities in extensional electro - osmotic flow thereby upsetting the laminar flow typical of microchannels .",
    "the breaking of laminar flow for dilute low viscosity viscoelastic fluids has implications for device design as laminar flow is often assumed in microflows ; as lab on a chip applications move towards more complex fluids this assumption must be checked .",
    "our results show that for flows of lightly polymer - doped low viscosity solutions through unoptimized geometries mixing is _ reduced _ relative to polymer - free solution , despite the excitation of dramatic large scale viscoelastic instabilities .",
    "this reduction is in contrast to earlier studies that found up to orders of magnitude increase in mixing , demonstrating that the role of shear or other deformations of the flow is crucial in promoting mixing .",
    "electro - osmotic flows can be used to isolate viscoelastic instabilities , and combined pressure / eof driven flows @xcite allow controlled application of shear enabling detailed investigation of flow evolution and mixing .",
    "in addition to fundamental studies possibility for application exists for the observed highly unstable , yet diffusion limited , flows in applications which depend on large interfacial area ; for example , in membraneless fuel cells @xcite or for use in combination with the liquid junction potential @xcite .",
