    "the millisecond radio pulsar psr  b1620@xmath026 , in the globular cluster m4 , has a low - mass binary companion ( probably a white dwarf of mass @xmath7 for a pulsar mass @xmath8 ) in a @xmath9day low - eccentricity orbit .",
    "in addition , its unusually large frequency second and third derivatives indicate the presence of a second companion in a wider orbit around the inner binary ( backer 1993 ; thorsett 1993 ; michel 1994 ) .",
    "such a hierarchical triple configuration is expected to be produced quite easily in a dense globular cluster through dynamical interactions between binaries ( rasio 1995 ; sigurdsson 1995 ) .",
    "timing data were taken at the vla and green bank ( 140-ft ) , using standard hardware and techniques .",
    "observations at the vla were made at 1.6  ghz ; observations at green bank were made at a variety of frequencies between 390  mhz and 1.6  ghz .",
    "the data span is 1988 march to 1995 december .",
    "timing parameters are reported in table1 , and in most cases represent an incremental improvement over previously published values .",
    "we report for the first time a value for @xmath3 , but emphasize that despite its high significance in this fit , covariance with unmodeled parameters ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) may complicate its interpretation .",
    "an identical fit with a fifth order polynomial yields @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( the other frequency derivatives are unchanged ) .    the globular cluster proper motion in ra and dec is @xmath13 and @xmath14 mas / yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is about @xmath15 from our timing proper motion , a difference that we do not believe is significant .",
    "the optical proper motion has magnitude @xmath16 .",
    "this will produce a change in the projected semi - major axis @xmath17 of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the orbital inclination and @xmath20 is the angle between the proper motion vector and the line of nodes ( neither @xmath19 nor @xmath20 is known ) . if the observed @xmath21 is due to proper motion , then @xmath22 implies @xmath23 , which in turn implies that the companion must have mass @xmath24 , i.e. , it is a neutron star or black hole , not a white dwarf .",
    "the nearly circular orbit is then problematic , but could be explained if the companion were captured in a three or four body interaction which involved a collision , followed by circularization during a thorne - zytkow phase or by a disk of material from a disrupted star . in our opinion , however , it is more likely that the observed @xmath21 has , instead , some contribution from another source , such as precession .    at the most likely orbital inclination @xmath25 , proper motion can account for only about 10% of the observed @xmath21 .",
    "a more attractive explanation is that @xmath21 is caused by precession of the binary orbit in the gravitational field of the same third body that has been invoked to explain the large spin - frequency derivatives .",
    "it can be shown that this `` planetary '' precession yields @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the angular velocity of the inner orbit and @xmath28 is the distance to the second companion ( assumed fixed ) .",
    "@xmath29 is a complex function of unknown angles , but has a median value for random orientations of @xmath30 , a 50% range of @xmath31 , and a 95% range of @xmath32 .    assuming the inner binary has mass @xmath33 and a low - eccentricity outer orbit , and ascribing the entire @xmath21 to precession",
    ", we can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the period of the outer orbit , and calculate @xmath29 for the three illustrative solutions of rasio ( 1994 ) . for @xmath36 and @xmath37yr , @xmath38 , while for @xmath39 and @xmath40yr , @xmath41 , and for @xmath42 and @xmath43yr , @xmath44 .",
    "we conclude that the measurement of @xmath21 is consistent with the presence of a third companion , and indeed is a strong indication that the triple hypothesis is correct .",
    "however , by itself it is only a poor discriminator between stellar and planetary solutions . with more information from spin frequency derivatives and from other orbital perturbations such as @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ", the measurement of @xmath21 will help untangle the various unknown angles that characterize the system .",
    "a complete analysis of these orbital perturbation effects will be presented elsewhere ( joshi & rasio 1996 ) .",
    "the best test to confirm the triple nature of this system would be a keplerian fit to the timing data spanning more than one orbit of the outer body .",
    "however , since the inferred orbital period @xmath35 is of order a century or more , we observe only a small portion of an orbit , effectively measuring successively higher order derivatives of the acceleration at a single point .",
    "if derivatives of the pulse frequency up to the _ fifth order _ were available , the system could in principle be solved completely ( except for the usual inclination angle ) for the orbital parameters and mass of the second companion .",
    "here we use the values listed in table  1 for frequency derivatives up to the fourth order to obtain a one - parameter family of solutions . while computing the orbital parameters of the second companion , we treat the inner binary as a single object of mass @xmath47 .",
    "for fixed values of the eccentricity @xmath48 and the inclination @xmath49 , we solve the non - linear system of equations for the frequency derivatives ( using the newton - raphson method ) for the mass @xmath1 , the semi - major axis @xmath50 , the angle of periastron @xmath51 and the longitude from pericenter @xmath52 ( joshi & rasio 1996 ) .",
    "1 illustrates our `` standard solution '' , obtained using the observed value of @xmath3 .",
    "we see that there are no solutions for @xmath53 .",
    "hence a nearly circular orbit is ruled out . for @xmath54",
    "there are two solutions for each value of the eccentricity , and hence two possible values of @xmath1 .",
    "in one solution , @xmath1 approaches zero as @xmath48 approaches @xmath55 .",
    "however for @xmath56 the triple configuration becomes dynamically unstable .",
    "in addition , we can rule out these solutions because they have very short orbital periods ( @xmath57yr ) and this would have been detected already in the timing data . for the other solutions ,",
    "@xmath1 increases monotonically in the range @xmath58 ( jupiter to brown - dwarf masses ) as @xmath48 increases from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the results obtained on varying @xmath3 within a @xmath6 error bar around the best fit value @xmath61 ( given in table  1 ) . the results are shown for @xmath62 = @xmath63 ( as in fig .  1 , solid line ) , @xmath64 ( long - dashed line ) , @xmath65 ( short - dashed line ) , @xmath66 ( dotted line ) and @xmath67 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "we find that stellar - mass solutions for @xmath1 are still possible if @xmath68 .",
    "a second companion of stellar mass would provide a natural explanation for the eccentricity of the inner binary in terms of secular perturbations ( rasio 1994 ) and would also be consistent with a preliminary identification of an optical counterpart for the system ( bailyn 1994 ) .",
