    "we checked that for @xmath70 the profile collapses entirely if we switch off hi after its formation.,width=283 ]    fig.[fig : sedi ] shows results for steady state density profiles @xmath36 under a constant gravity force @xmath7 , at various @xmath71 , in a system of 1000 particles with hard walls at the base and ceiling and periodic boundary conditions horizontally .",
    "as discussed in the main text , far from a proximal region the exponential form predicted without hi in @xcite is maintained ( within error ) with hi present .",
    "however as @xmath45 , @xmath6 seemingly remains higher than predicted .",
    "the details depend however on the resolution used ( fig.[fig : sedi ] ) and our studies suggest that the larger fitted @xmath6 is in fact a proximal effect caused by the random stirring of the fluid by particles near the wall , causing upward advection of some of the particles above .",
    "if so , we expect this effect to die out at larger distances with the asymptotic decay length @xmath6 reverting to its non - hi value .",
    "in any case , the role of hi in altering the steady state appears modest : in particular , we see no evidence of hi inducing macroscopic flow patterns ( which , in the absence of a free energy , would be possible ) .",
    "in the following we show how the disorder in the position of swimmers on a shell generates the instability , and compare it with other possible mechanisms that are shown to be less relevant .",
    "to do so we consider an initial condition where the swimmers have swum as far as they can and are thus located on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath72 . in the absence of any flow , the only forces acting on the swimmers are their propulsive forces and the trapping force . because both the fluid and the swimmers are at rest , there is no drag force and the only force felt by the fluid is the propulsive force : effectively the external trapping force has been passed onto the fluid and the effect of the swimmer on the fluid is to create a static",
    ", inward pointing stokeslet whose amplitude equals the propulsive force ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : effectofswimmer ] ) .     is the propulsive force , @xmath49 the drag and @xmath73 the external , trapping force .",
    "the very bottom arrows decompose the swimmer s effect on the fluid into stokeslet and stresslet components , illustrating that the external , trapping force is effectively passed onto the fluid . ]    because our swimmers are point - like particles at zero reynolds number , the flow created by @xmath74 swimmers is simply the superposition of the flow created by each one of them . to understand the effect of such flows on a swimmer , let us consider the simpler situation of an inward pointing stokeslet of magnitude @xmath75 held fixed at the north pole of a sphere of radius @xmath15 and a swimmer located at an euler angle @xmath76 on the surface of this sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ schema ] ) . the flow field created at this point by the stokeslet",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath77 while the corresponding vorticity is : @xmath78     ( red arrow ) held fixed at the north pole of a sphere of radius @xmath15 and its effect on a swimmer located at euler angles @xmath79 and @xmath80 , whose orientation ( magenta arrow ) makes an angle @xmath81 with the normal to the sphere .",
    "the vorticity is indicated in blue and tend to rotate the swimmer towards the stokeslet . ]    for small @xmath79 , that is when the swimmer is in the vicinity of the stokeslet , the flow has two effects : the swimmer is advected inwards ( @xmath82 ) and rotated by the vorticity field _ towards _ the stokeslet ( @xmath83 while @xmath84 , the swimmer rotates counterclockwise on figure [ schema ] ) . as time goes on , the swimmer thus also start swimming _ towards _ the stokeslet .",
    "this argument can be made more quantitative by considering the dynamics of the swimmer ( neglecting the effect of the swimmer on the flow ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the effective friction coefficient of the swimmer  @xcite , @xmath87 the propulsive force of the swimmer and @xmath88 the trapping force .",
    "let us then introduce @xmath89 and @xmath90 the unit vectors normal and tangent to the sphere at the position of the swimmer , so that the position of the swimmer is @xmath91 . using the expression of the flow , the equations of motion of the swimmer can be rewritten @xmath92    let us now consider the dynamics of a swimmer that is initially pointing out radially ( @xmath93 ) and is close to the stokeslet , say @xmath94 .",
    "initially , one finds as expected @xmath95 so that the swimmers falls inwards .",
    "the second equation show that , initially , the flow advects the swimmer _",
    "away _ from the stokeslet ( @xmath96 at @xmath97 ) . as time goes on however , the angle @xmath81 increases ( third equation ) and @xmath98 will change sign . at larger time , the swimmer is indeed _ swimming _ towards the stokeslet .",
    "when the particles move away from the surface of the trap , equations ( [ eqn : earlydynamics ] ) become more complex and we do not attempt an analytic approach and include these equations only to illustrate the qualitative behaviour of the swimmers .     and are identical for the two sets of simulations .",
    "this is expected since the initial condition with the densest patch on the top aims at being a simple rotation of the uniform one .",
    "the discrete symbols correspond to @xmath99 . in this case , the control decreases much more that the simulation with the densest patch on the top which shows that density fluctuation on a scale attained by the random distribution of swimmers suffice to control the instability . ]        let us now come back to the problem of @xmath74 swimmers in the absence of any external flow .",
    "firstly , note that by symmetry one sees that a perfectly uniform layer of stokeslets can not create any flow and is thus in mechanical equilibrium . because we consider a finite number of swimmers , the density of stokeslets on the surface on the sphere can not , however , be uniform but can be decomposed as the sum of two contributions : a perfectly uniform layer of inward pointing stokeslets , representing the _ average _ density , and a layer of inward and outward pointing stokeslets representing the more dense and less dense regions , i.e. , the density _",
    "fluctuations_. close to the denser regions , one can thus expect to see the scenario described above for the motion of a swimmer in an inward pointing stokeslet flow .",
    "this is indeed what we see in a simulation of 1000 swimmers randomly distributed on the boundary of the trap ( see fig .  3 ) . around the denser patch located at the top ,",
    "the far - field flow created by the swimmers resembles that of a stokeslet .",
    "furthermore , the trajectories of the neighboring swimmers resemble the one described above for a single swimmer in a stokeslet flow .",
    "density fluctuations within the surface of the trap are thus a strong candidate for the origin of the instability .    to confirm this role we compare simulations where the densest patch of the initial condition is placed at the top of the trap with those obtained from random uniform initial conditions",
    "let us first specify what we mean by a dense patch .",
    "since there are 1000 swimmers , every patch of surface @xmath100 contains on average @xmath101 $ ] swimmers , with fluctuations of the order of @xmath102 .",
    "we thus choose a patch size @xmath100 that is a small fraction of the sphere but large enough that fluctuations are not much larger than the mean density . we achieve this by considering a spherical cap defined by @xmath103 , which contains on average @xmath104 swimmers . to cover the sphere with patches of this size , one would need roughly 60 patches , which means that the densest patch contains on average 27 swimmers .",
    "our ` dense patch ' initial condition is thus constructed as follows : each swimmer is placed uniformly on the sphere with probability @xmath75 or uniformly on the top spherical cap with probability @xmath105 . in practice , @xmath75 is chosen so that the average number of swimmers in the spherical cap is @xmath106 .",
    "we then want to compare the instability between this initial condition and the one where swimmers are uniformly randomly distributed ( from now on , we refer to this initial configuration as ` control ' ) .",
    "if tangential density fluctuations are not the cause of the instability , the statistical outcome of the ` dense patch ' and ` control ' simulations should be the same .    to compare the instability",
    ", we can look at the generated flow fields . from our lattice boltzmann simulations we get a 3d grid with fluid velocities @xmath107 at the nodes .",
    "any measure of the intensity of the flow yields qualitatively similar results and we thus consider @xmath108 . in figure",
    "[ fig : densevscontrol ] we report @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where the averages are done over 50 runs both for the control and the dense patch cases .",
    "we see that the two initial conditions give very similar @xmath111 : this validates our ` dense patch ' initial condition which is not very different , once rotated appropriately , from a ` control ' one .",
    "since the random uniform case is perfectly isotropic , we expect the flow field to vanish when averaged over many runs .",
    "when comparing @xmath110 , we indeed see that such is the case for the control ; by increasing further the number of runs over which the average is done , the non - zero residual flow would continue to decrease . for the dense patch case",
    "however , the flow remains much larger . because the denser patch at the top has to compete with other dense patches , there is some randomness in the orientation of the flow generated by the instability and the intensity of the flow",
    "has decreased .",
    "it remains however three times larger than the control case , which shows that fluctuations of density of the scale of those observed in the simulations are sufficient to create the instability .",
    "a less quantitative but more direct comparison can be done by starting a control simulation , locating the patch where the instability starts and rotating the view in such a way that it is at the top .",
    "one can then compare it with a ` dense patch ' run ( see figure [ fig : directcomp ] ) .",
    "both configuration are indeed very similar , confirming the role of tangential density fluctuations in creating the instability .     whereas symbols correspond to @xmath112 .",
    "all initial conditions produce similar flow ( solid line ) , and thus similar instability .",
    "the averaged flows of the displaced initial conditions and the control are the same at large times , showing that these perturbations have a much smaller effect on the setup than the one due to density fluctuations .",
    "note that the non - zero initial flow is caused by particles swimming back to the border of the trap . ]",
    "in addition to the non - uniformity of the density of swimmers on the surface of the trap , other sources of perturbation could be responsible for the instability .",
    "first , the swimmers can fluctuate in radial position ( ` radial disorder ' ) , and second they may not all be strictly pointing outwards ( ` angular disorder ' ) .",
    "we now show below that these fluctuations are less relevant than the tangential density fluctuations .      to study the role of radial displacement , we place the swimmers at random over the whole sphere uniformly and then move downwards those in the same spherical cap as previously contained the dense set of bacteria .",
    "( there is no longer an excess density in this cap , however . )",
    "again    we compare the instability by looking at the flow fields . as can be seen in figure [ fig : displaced ] , @xmath113 to look for systematic effects . at large times , the flow field is the same as the control one and much smaller than that of the dense patch ; this perturbation does not fix the direction of the instability . hence radial disorder , even for large displacements , does not control the instability observed from the random initial configurations .     whereas symbols correspond to @xmath114 .",
    "all initial conditions produces similar strength of flow , and thus of instability .",
    "the average flow of the random rotations equals that of the control , showing that these perturbation have a much smaller effect on the setup than the density fluctuations . ]",
    "we either generate randomly a rotation matrix and apply it to all these simmwers ( uniform rotation ) or we pick up one rotation matrix per swimmer ( random rotation ) .",
    "the strength of the perturbation is controlled by varying the average rotation angle of the distribution of the rotation matrix . in both cases",
    ", @xmath115 perfectly overlaps with the control ( see figure [ fig : rotationr ] and [ fig : rotationu ] ) , while the quantity @xmath116 is as small as the control .",
    "these results confirm that the initial rotation has no part to play in triggering the instability .     whereas symbols correspond to @xmath114 .",
    "all initial conditions produce similar strength of flow , and thus of instability .",
    "the average flow of the uniformly rotated initial condition is however of the same order as the control one , showing that these perturbation have a much smaller effect on the setup than the density fluctuations . ]",
    "are shown , colored by magnitude of lab - frame speed in units of @xmath0 ( key : lower color bar ) .",
    "the flow profile is shown on the left ( same key).,width=264 ]",
    "interestingly , our stability analysis allows us to evaluate the impact of brownian motion on the trap instability . for _",
    ", thermal diffusivity is @xmath117 whereas its rotational counterpart is @xmath118  @xcite . over the time scale of a second , which is the average time between two tumbles , this corresponds to diffusion length and angle of about half a micrometer and 20 degrees .",
    "the simulations presented in the previous subsections shows that these perturbations are negligible when compared to the density fluctuations .",
    "brownian motion should thus not affect the trap instability .",

    "<S> this emergent structure contains regions of high density whose details will depend on near - field physics that we do not resolve . </S>",
    "<S> however , the initial instability is well captured by far - field hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the end - state is likewise robust , in that _ any _ instability leading to formation of a single oriented swarm within the confines of a trap ( harmonic or otherwise ) will cause a similar ` self - pumping ' state . </S>",
    "<S> to better understand the initial instability , we consider the limit of infrequent tumbling , @xmath52 . here , without hi , the unique steady state comprises a thin uniform layer of outward swimmers at @xmath15 , each with its propulsive force balanced by the external trapping force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coupling this to a solvent , we have locally a two dimensional layer of particles exerting inward point forces ( stokeslets ) on the fluid .    because the particles on the initial shell can have not only tangential displacements ( causing density changes ) but also radial and orientational ones , a formal stability analysis of the coupled hydrodynamics of the swimmers in this layer is not practicable . </S>",
    "<S> ( moreover , noise in the run and tumble dynamics could alter the conclusions . ) nonetheless , by a careful series of simulations ( detailed , with additional figures , in appendix  [ sec : appinst ] ) we have identified that the instability mode is caused initially by tangential density fluctuations on the surface of the trap ( @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such density fluctuations are inevitable if the total number of swimmers is not infinite , and lead to instability via the following mechanism . any surface patch that happens to be denser than the surrounding ones will generate locally an excess stokeslet - like flow ( not cancelled by the contributions from distant parts of the shell ) . </S>",
    "<S> this flow has two effects . </S>",
    "<S> first , it advects the swimmers in the dense patch towards the center of the trap ; second , it rotates neighboring particles so that these start swimming _ towards _ the dense patch , creating positive feedback ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : zoominsta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting clump creates a macroscopic flow that sweeps the remaining particles towards itself ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trap - frame ] ) .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if in our simulations we radially displace a patch without altering its density , the feedback is negative ; this also applies for a patch in which only the orientation of the swimmers is perturbed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although radial and orientational modes are strongly excited in the subsequent dynamics , they are not the cause of the initial instability ( see appendix  [ sec : appinst ] ) . notably the same instability is present for contractile rather than extensile swimmers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is fully consistent with the mechanism above , in which the stokeslet from the confining force is transferred to the fluid by a stationary swimmer ( the sign of whose stresslet is then less important ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since the densest initial patch usually outstrips its competitors to create a dominant stokeslet , there is little excitation of modes above the first spherical harmonic . </S>",
    "<S> ( this can also be explained by expanding in such harmonics the flow arising from a nonuniform shell of point forces @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> the instability reported here is somewhat related to that found by crowley , who showed that dense regions in a sedimenting suspension fall more rapidly @xcite , with the fastest growth at long wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> however , the initial force balance is different enough to prevent a direct mapping from one instability to the other .    </S>",
    "<S> _ upstream swimming : _ we turn finally to run - and - tumble particles confined between parallel plates at separation @xmath17 . in the absence of hi , we expect the majority of particles to be near the walls whenever @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is the same as for the spherical trap , but the hi - induced instability of the layer found in that case is suppressed here by the no - slip boundary condition at the wall .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of a swimmer adjacent to a wall can be complex @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead of resolving the near - field hi we apply a truncated lennard jones ( lj ) potential ( range @xmath55 lattice sites ) which balances the normal component of the propulsive force . </S>",
    "<S> the tangential component still leads to motion . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> near - field hi could reduce or enhance this motion and also can , for chiral swim - strokes , lead to circular orbits @xcite . treating these complexities </S>",
    "<S> would introduce nonuniversal parameters into the model ; by neglecting them , we can clarify whether or not they are essential in the context of poiseuille flow . here </S>",
    "<S> upstream swimming has been observed experimentally , and a detailed mechanism proposed that requires chiral swimming @xcite . without questioning this result for the regimes addressed in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we note that for narrow micro - channels ( @xmath56 ) , a much simpler mechanism is also at work . </S>",
    "<S> recall that in this regime , any swimmer in the bulk of the channel moves to the wall layer and stays there a long time before tumbling . on approach to the wall </S>",
    "<S> any such swimmer is rotated by the velocity gradient so as to align its swimming direction upstream . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is strong whenever the product of the wall shear rate and the transit time across the gap is large ; this equates to @xmath57 with @xmath58 the flow speed at the mid - plane . </S>",
    "<S> this condition ensures that for a uniform @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) the upstream wall flux is outweighed by a downstream bulk flux . </S>",
    "<S> however for @xmath56 , @xmath59 is peaked at the walls , and a net upstream flux results . for typical particle trajectories </S>",
    "<S> see appendix [ sec : appflow ] . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig:4 ] shows the region in parameter space where there is a net upstream flux , and plots of the particle density and mean orientation in this region . </S>",
    "<S> these results are slightly shifted quantitatively , but not qualitatively , by increasing the lb resolution , or adopting slightly different ( but still inelastic @xcite ) wall collision rules .     </S>",
    "<S> ( triangles , circles , squares ) and @xmath61 ( green , blue , pink ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset : state diagram showing contours of the average swimmer speed , at interval @xmath62 . starting from @xmath63 in the top left ( solid blue ) , the value decreases to zero ( thick black ) , further reducing to @xmath64 on the right ( dashed pink ) . at the wall , </S>",
    "<S> particles feel a truncated lj potential of range 0.25 . ]    _ conclusion : _ above we have presented results from an efficient hydrodynamic simulation of dilute run - and - tumble swimmers . under gravity </S>",
    "<S> we find only perturbative effects of hi on the flux - free steady state of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much stronger effects are found in geometries where , without hi , all particles are swimming locally in the same direction . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with a crude power counting argument : for a sheet of swimmers , the @xmath65 velocity contributions from each stresslet can not give a large effect unless they add coherently . </S>",
    "<S> this happens for the trap and the parallel plate geometry , but only when the run - length exceeds the confinement length . for harmonic traps , </S>",
    "<S> the flux - free steady state is then replaced by one in which a symmetry - breaking swarm of swimmers acts as a pump . for swimmers in microchannels , outward - oriented particles at the confining walls are aligned by shear to create an upstream particle flux without the need for chiral motion . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that these predictions will stimulate new quantitative experiments on the fundamental physics of self - propelled micro - organisms in suspension .    </S>",
