    "this fact is deeply connected to the theory of optimal transport ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the bijective gradient map @xmath6 , called the brenier map , is the optimal - transport plan from the density ( [ eqn : grad ] ) to the uniform density . in this paper , we call @xmath2 _ the potential function_. furthermore , as explained in section  [ section : sgm ] , most density functions on @xmath0^m$ ] are characterized by the fourier series of @xmath2 .",

    "another approach to deal with unbounded data is given by the author s past papers ( @xcite , @xcite ) , where optimal transport between the standard normal density and other densities is considered . in this paper , we use the uniform density instead of the normal density because the former is analytically simpler than the latter .",
