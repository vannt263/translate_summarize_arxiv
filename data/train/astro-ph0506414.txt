    "high energy astrophysical phenomena involve , in many cases , relativistic flows , typical examples are superluminal motion of relativistic jets in extragalactic radio sources , accretion flows around massive compact objects , pulsar winds and gamma ray bursts .",
    "the modeling of such phenomena has prompted the search for efficient and accurate numerical formulations of the special relativistic fluid equations ( for an excellent review see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is now a strong consensus that the so - called `` high - resolution shock - capturing '' schemes provide the necessary tools in developing stable and robust relativistic fluid dynamical codes .",
    "one of the fundamental ingredients of such schemes is the exact or approximate solution to the riemann problem .",
    "the solution to the riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics ( rhd henceforth ) has been extensively studied in literature , and an exact solution can be found within high degree of accuracy by iterative techniques , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of the major differences with the classical counterpart is the velocity coupling introduced by the lorentz factor and the coupling of the latter with the specific enthalpy .",
    "this considerably adds to the computational cost , making the use of an exact solver code prohibitive in a multidimensional godunov - type code .    from this perspective , approximate solvers based on alternative strategies have been devised : local linearization @xcite , two - shock approximation @xcite , flux - splitting methods @xcite , and so forth , see @xcite for a comprehensive review . most of these solvers , however , rely on rather expensive characteristic decompositions of the jacobian matrix or involve iterative techniques to solve highly nonlinear equations .",
    "although they usually attain better resolution at discontinuities , some of these methods may produce unphysical states with negative densities or pressures , as it has been shown by @xcite for linearized riemann solvers in the context of classical hydrodynamics .",
    "the hll method devised by @xcite for classical gasdynamics belongs to a different class of approximate riemann solvers and has gained increasing popularity among researchers in the last decade .",
    "it has been implemented in the context of the relativistic fluid equations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hll approach does not require a full characteristic decomposition of the equations and is straightforward to implement in a godunov - type code .",
    "besides the computational efficiency , this class of solvers has the attractive feature of being positively conservative in the sense that preserve initially positive densities , energy and pressures .",
    "the hll formulation , however , lacks the ability to resolve isolated contact discontinuity and for this reason has a more diffusive character than other more sophisticated algorithms . to compensate for this",
    ", @xcite developed an extension of the hll solver for the euler equations introducing a two - state hll - type solver called hllc ( where `` c '' stands for contact ) that improves the treatment of the contact discontinuity , see also @xcite .",
    "recently this approach has been generalized to the magnetohydrodynamic equations @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend this approach to the relativistic equation of fluid dynamics .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in  [ sec : equations ] the relevant equations are given , in ",
    "[ sec : hll ] we describe the new approximate riemann solver and in  [ sec : test ] we asses the strength of the new method with one and two dimensional tests .",
    "the motion of an ideal relativistic fluid is governed by conservation of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "the pertaining equations are cast as a hyperbolic system of conservation laws @xcite which , in two dimensions , reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the unknown vector of conservative variables , whereas @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the fluxes along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions : @xmath6 generalization to three dimensions is straightforward .    in equations ( [ eq : vectors ] ) , @xmath7 is the thermal pressure , whereas @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the mass , momentum and energy densities relative to the lab frame , where the fluid has velocity @xmath11 .",
    "units are conveniently normalized so that the speed of light is @xmath12 .    the relation between conserved variables @xmath13 and physical quantities @xmath14 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the proper rest mass density , @xmath17 is the lorentz factor and @xmath18 is the specific enthalpy .",
    "proper closure is provided by specifying an equation of state in the form @xmath19 .",
    "for an ideal gas , the enthalpy has the form @xmath20 and the sound speed is defined by @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the ( constant ) specific heat ratio . by letting @xmath23 , we see that the square of the sound speed has the limiting value @xmath24 .",
    "since it can be shown @xcite that the specific heat ratio @xmath22 can not exceed @xmath25 , one always has @xmath26 .",
    "this is an important result for the positivity of the hll and hllc schemes and will be used in a later section",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : p2c ] ) gives @xmath13 in terms of the primitive state vector @xmath27 .",
    "the inverse relation involves the solution of a nonlinear equation for the pressure @xmath7 : @xmath28 where @xmath29^{-{\\frac{1}{2}}}$ ] .",

    "the two initial states @xmath35 and @xmath36 decay into two nonlinear waves ( with speeds @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and a linear contact wave with velocity @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting wave pattern divides the @xmath40 plane into four regions each defining a constant state : @xmath35 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath36.,width=317 ]    the solution of the riemann problem for the special relativistic fluid equations has been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it consists of a self - similar three - wave pattern generated by the decay of the initial discontinuity ( [ eq : riemann ] ) . the resulting riemann fan ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fan ] ) is bounded by two nonlinear waves ( representing either shocks or rarefactions ) separated by a contact discontinuity moving at the fluid velocity . across the contact discontinuity ,",
    "pressure and normal velocity are continuous whereas density and tangential velocities experience jumps .",
    "the same holds also in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "contrary to the newtonian counterpart , however , all variables are discontinuous across a shock wave or change smoothly through a rarefaction fan @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the velocity coupling introduced by the lorentz factor @xmath43 and by the coupling of the latter with the specific enthalpy @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting wave pattern can be solved to a high degree of precision by iterative techniques and has been implemented for the first time in the one - dimensional godunov - type code by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , when tangential velocities are included , the computational effort increases considerably , and the use of an exact solver in a multidimensional godunov - type code can become prohibitive .    here",
    "we consider a different approach , based on the original prescription given by @xcite ( hll ) for the classical euler equations and subsequently extended by @xcite ( hllc ) .",
    "both the hll and hllc formulations do not require a field by field decomposition of the relativistic equations , a feature which makes them particularly attractive , specially in multi - dimensional applications .",
    "harten , lax and van leer @xcite proposed an approximate solution to the riemann problem where the two states bounded by the two acoustic waves are averaged into a single constant state .",
    "in other words , the solution to the riemann problem on the @xmath44 axis consists of the three possible constant states : @xmath45 where we dropped , for simplicity , the half integer notation @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite noted that the single state @xmath47 could be constructed from an a priori estimate of the fastest and slowest signal velocities @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "notice that equation ( [ eq : hll_state ] ) represents the integral average of the solution of the riemann problem over the wave fan @xcite .",
    "the corresponding interface numerical flux is defined as : @xmath51 where @xmath52    thus , given a wave speed estimate for the fastest and slowest speeds @xmath38 and @xmath37 ( see  [ sec : speeds ] ) , an approximate solution to the riemann problem can be constructed and the intercell numerical fluxes for the conservative update ( [ eq : update ] ) are computed using ( [ eq : hll_fluxes ] ) .    this approach has been applied for the first time to the one - dimensional relativistic equations by @xcite and later by @xcite for the multidimensional case .    although the hll prescription is computationally inexpensive and straightforward to implement , a major drawback is its inability to resolve contact or tangential waves . on the contrary",
    "the hllc scheme , originally introduced by @xcite in the context of the euler equations of classical gasdynamics , does not suffer from this loss . in the next section",
    "we generalize this approach to the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the hllc scheme restores the full wave structure inside the riemann fan by replacing the single averaged state defined by ( [ eq : hll_state ] ) with two approximate states , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these two states are separated by a middle contact wave which is assumed to have constant speed @xmath39 , so that the full solution to the riemann problem now reads @xmath53 and the corresponding intercell numerical fluxes are : @xmath54    the intermediate state fluxes @xmath55 and @xmath56 may be expressed in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath42 from the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions : @xmath57 where here and throughout the following , quantities without a suffix @xmath58 or @xmath59 refer indifferently to the left ( @xmath58 ) or right ( @xmath59 ) states .",
    "notice that , in general , @xmath60 but @xmath61 .",
    "we remind the reader that the hll and hllc solvers differ in the representation of the intermediate states . in the case of supersonic flows ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) ,",
    "in fact , the two solvers become equivalent .",
    "the same result also holds for an exact riemann solver .",
    "if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given ( see  [ sec : speeds ] ) , equation ( [ eq : jump_1 ] ) represent a system of @xmath64 equations ( where @xmath65 is the number of components of @xmath13 ) for the @xmath66 unknowns @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath39 .",
    "three additional constraints come from the requirements that both pressure and normal velocity be continuous across the contact wave ( i.e. @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) and that @xmath69 .",
    "this , however , yields a total of only @xmath70 equations , still not sufficient to solve the system . in order to reduce the number of unknowns and have a well - posed problem",
    ", further assumptions have to be made on the form of the fluxes @xmath71 . here",
    "we assume that the two - dimensional fluxes can be written as @xmath72    in such a way , both @xmath73 and @xmath71 are expressed in terms of the five unknowns @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the normal components of momentum in the star region , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , are not independent variables since , for consistency , we require that @xmath81 . in the classical case ,",
    "this assumption becomes equivalent to @xmath82 .",
    "this yields a total of @xmath83 equations in @xmath83 unknowns .    writing explicitly equation ( [ eq : jump_1 ] ) for the left or the right state yields @xmath84    if one combines the last of ( [ eq : jumps ] ) together with the second one , the following expression giving @xmath39 in terms of @xmath78",
    "may be obtained : @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 .    by imposing @xmath88 across the contact discontinuity",
    "we find the following quadratic equation for @xmath39 : @xmath89 in equation ( [ eq : lambdastar ] ) , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the energy and momentum components of the hll flux given by equation ( [ eq : hll_flux ] ) , whereas @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the energy and normal momentum components of the hll state vector , equation ( [ eq : hll_state ] ) . of the two roots of equation ( [ eq : lambdastar ] ) only the one with the minus sign",
    "is physically acceptable , since it lies in the range @xmath94 and , according to the wave - speed estimate presented in ",
    "[ sec : speeds ] , can be interpreted as an average velocity between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the mathematical proof of this statement is given in the appendix ( [ app : a ] ) .",
    "besides , the same root has the correct classical limit , that is @xmath95 as @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this wave speed is the same one proposed by @xcite and further discussed in @xcite .",
    "once @xmath39 is known , @xmath78 is computed from ( [ eq : lambda_p ] ) and the components of @xmath73 are readily obtained from ( [ eq : jumps ] ) .",
    "finally we notice that the method is consistent , in that the integral average over the riemann fan automatically satisfies the consistency condition by construction @xcite : @xmath98 or , alternatively , @xmath99 incidentally , we notice that equation ( [ eq : lambdastar ] ) could have been obtained by algebraic manipulations of equations ( [ eq : consistency ] ) and ( [ eq : consistency2 ] ) .",
    "the wave speeds needed in our formulation are estimates for the lower and upper bounds of the signal velocities in the solution to the riemann problem @xcite . here",
    "we consider the relativistic generalization of the estimates given by @xcite for the euler equation of gasdynamics .",
    "the same choice has been initially adopted by @xcite , @xcite in their relativistic hll solver and is commonly used by other authors , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "specifically we set : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix @xmath103 .",
    "they are the roots of the quadratic equation @xmath104 with @xmath105 , and hence @xmath106 it should be mentioned that the wave speed estimate ( [ eq : wavespeeds ] ) is not the only possible one and different choices ( such as the roe average ) may be considered .",
    "adopting the same notations as in @xcite , we denote with @xmath107 the set of physically admissible conservative states : @xmath108 where the second inequality simultaneously guarantees pressure positivity and that the total velocity never exceeds the speed of light .",
    "we remind the reader that the pressure @xmath109 computed from the conservative state @xmath73 using ( [ eq : c2p ] ) should not be confused with @xmath78 appearing in the flux definition ( [ eq : flux ] ) .",
    "the two pressures are , in fact , different and the positivity argument should apply to @xmath109 rather than @xmath78 , which can take negative values under certain circumstances .",
    "similar considerations hold for the velocity @xmath39 of the contact discontinuity for which , in general , we have @xmath110 .",
    "thus @xmath78 and @xmath39 may be more conveniently considered as auxiliary variables .",
    "this is one of the fundamental differences between our relativistic solver and the classical hllc scheme , for which @xmath111 and thus only @xmath78 plays the role of an auxiliary parameter .",
    "this behavior is a direct consequence of the relativistic coupling between thermodynamical and kinetical terms , a feature absent in the newtonian formulation .",
    "the positivity of the hllc scheme is preserved if each of the two intermediate states @xmath41 and @xmath42 are contained in g.    for the density , the proof is trivial and follows from the inequalities @xmath112 and @xmath113 , see appendix  [ app : a ] .",
    "unfortunately the analytical proof of the second statement presents some algebraic difficulties , since the second of ( [ eq : positivity ] ) reduces to an inequality for a quartic equation in @xmath39 .",
    "however , extensive numerical testing , part of which is presented in  [ sec : test ] , has shown that the second of ( [ eq : positivity ] ) is always satisfied for all pair of states @xmath35 and @xmath36 whose wave speeds are computed according to ( [ eq : wavespeeds ] ) and for which an exact analytical solution to the riemann problem exists ( i.e. no vacuum is created ) .",

    ", one should keep in mind that hll - type solvers are iteration - free since the underlying algorithms always require a fixed number of operations , regardless of the initial condition . on the contrary ,",
    "iterative nonlinear riemann solvers have a certain degree of adaptability since the number of iterations to achieve convergence depends on the strength of the discontinuity at the zone interface . in smooth regions of the flow , for example ,",
    "fewer iterations are usually needed .",
    "this explains why the fourth test problems is particularly time consuming , since a stronger discontinuity is involved .    in this respect ,",
    "a direct comparison between different riemann solvers becomes problem - dependent and can be used only as an order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "conversely , we do not expect the hllc / hll efficiency ratio to change with increasing complexity of the flow patterns .",
    "for this reason , we believe that for problems involving rich and complex structures the trade - off between computational efficiency and quality of results is certainly worth the effort .",
    "we have presented , for the first time , an extension of the hllc scheme by @xcite to relativistic gas dynamics .",
    "the solver is robust , computationally efficient and complete , in that it considers the full wave structure in the solution to the riemann problem .",
    "the solver retains the attractive feature of being positively conservative , typical of the hll scheme family .    the major improvement over the simple single - state hll solver is the ability to resolve contact and tangential discontinuities .",
    "this property has been demonstrated by direct comparisons in several one- and two - dimensional test problems , where differences are strongly evident .",
    "the results indicate that the new hllc solver attains sharper representation of discontinuities , quantitatively similar to the exact but algebraically and computationally more intensive riemann solver .",
    "the additional computational cost over the traditional hll approach is less than @xmath239 and we believe that the improved quality of results largely justifies the trade - off between the two approximate riemann solvers .",
    "extension to relativistic magnetized flows will be considered in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we notice , however , that the hllc formalism presented in this work can be easily generalized to the case of vanishing normal component of magnetic field . when this degeneracy occurs ( as in the propagation of jets with toroidal magnetic field",
    ", see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in fact , the solution to the riemann problem is entirely analogous to the non - magnetized case , since only three waves are actually involved .",
    "this extension will be presented in @xcite .    finally , we mention that the relativistic hllc scheme does not make any assumption on the equation of state , and efforts to incorporate different equations of state should be minimal .",
