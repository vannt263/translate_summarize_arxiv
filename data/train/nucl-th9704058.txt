    "the pion - nucleon interaction has been a fruitful source of knowledge of the strong interaction .",
    "the properties of the baryon resonances produced in pion - nucleon collisions give strong support for the quark model .",
    "the subthreshold amplitude is related to the value of the pion - nucleon @xmath4-term which constrains models of nucleon structure . the pion - nucleon coupling constant provides fundamental input for the calculation of nuclear forces . beyond these surface features",
    "lie more subtle indications of the nature of the strong interaction .",
    "we model the dynamics of this interaction by a coupled - channel klein - gordon equation whose potential is assumed to be the fourth component of a lorentz vector .",
    "there are several advantages to this approach .",
    "first , unitarity , coulomb corrections , multichannel effects , and hadronic mass splittings may be included in a natural way .    next , by solving the klein - gordon equation at the appropriate kinematical point , any observable can be calculated , even in the subthreshold region .",
    "this is especially easy in the case of the s - wave scattering with an exponential potential , for which an analytical result is available .    by using such a model",
    "we are presented with an alternative approach to such quantities as the @xmath4-term .",
    "while the value of the @xmath4-term may well be more accurately determined by dispersion relations , by looking at it from the point of view of a potential theory the structure of the system is perhaps better revealed in the sense that the behavior of the subthreshold amplitude is directly related to the shape of the potential ( and presumably to the distribution of the constituents of the pion and nucleon ) .",
    "a more subtle advantage is that models which take a broader view of the system , including higher energy data , have the problem that the model must be valid over the entire range . in this way",
    "the low - energy parameters have been largely determined by the data at high energies and the assumed dependence of the model for the low - energy behavior .",
    "thus such features as the singularities in the scattering amplitude due to cuts coming from the range of the interaction depend almost entirely on the model assumptions . in the present technique , which does not claim to be a theory of the system , the low - energy regime can be investigated without recourse to data at higher energies .",
    "finally , solutions in coordinate space allow us to develop an intuitive picture of the spatial structure of the interacting pion - nucleon system .",
    "our klein - gordon model also has several drawbacks : the model is purely phenomenological at the hadronic level . because it is a model based on static potentials , virtual particle production and annihilation and retardation effects are not explicitly included . as with all potential models ,",
    "effects of crossing symmetry must be inserted . because of the efficiency of the jost calculation of the s - wave amplitude for the exponential potential ( and the rapid cut - off properties of the gaussian potential in @xmath5-space ) we are able to incorporate ( in a controlled approximation ) the crossing symmetry condition that the isovector amplitude must vanish at the cheng - dashen ( cd ) point into the fitting procedure . the relativistic effect in the center - of - mass motion",
    "is taken into account only approximately . because we describe only low - energy phenomena",
    ", we believe that these defects are outweighed by the model s strengths .    in a previous paper @xcite we presented results bearing on the breaking of isospin using the same technique applied here @xcite with a selection of five different forms of potential . on examining the phase shifts produced outside the range of the fit",
    "it was noticed that the prediction was much better for two of the models , sums of local yukawa and exponential potentials for each partial wave . from fitting the data from 30 to 50 mev these two models were able to predict the existence of the 33 resonance , and indeed the position of the resonance to within about 10% in kinetic energy .",
    "thus it seemed reasonable to extend the analysis to somewhat higher energy with one ( or both ) of these two models .",
    "the yukawa potential has the advantage that it naturally represents particle exchanges . as will be discussed in sec . 3",
    ", the klein - gordon equation contains a term which is quadratic in the potential . for a yukawa potential ,",
    "such a term is singular ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "while solutions of this equation are obtainable , the result would seem to be more physical if a cutoff is introduced to soften the potential at small values of @xmath5 ( perhaps due to the intrinsic size the of quark - pion system ) .",
    "for an analysis employing particle exchange ( hence approximately related to yukawa potentials ) see the recent work of timmermans@xcite",
    ".    one goal of this article is the representation of the pion - nucleon interaction in a simple and transparent manner .",
    "the exponential potential lends itself to that end without introducing a singular potential .",
    "another advantage of the exponential form is that it might better represent the interaction of the pion with quark distributions within the nucleon .",
    "( the density calculated from a bound - state solution of a wave equation with a @xmath7 potential is exponential , as in the hydrogen atom and a three body system tends to follow the same density@xcite . )",
    "we have also made a short study utilizing the gaussian potential , even though it is not considered to have a strong physical basis , to estimate which results are sensitive to the form of the potential ( see sec .",
    "[ gauss ] ) .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 summarizes our choice of elastic - scattering data sets and briefly discusses their consistency .",
    "section 3 reviews jost s method for determining the s - wave amplitude for sums of exponential potentials .",
    "our method of evaluation of the subthreshold amplitudes is described in section 4 .",
    "section 5 begins by presenting numerical values of the potential parameters determined from a fit to the data .",
    "this is followed by subsections which present the consequences of the fit , such as the phase shifts , scattering lengths , coupling constant , sigma term , off - shell amplitudes , partial integrated elastic cross section , and polarization asymmetry .",
    "the results are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the data sets that we have considered come from , for the most part , experiments dedicated to the measurement of pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "we have excluded experiments which have not been published or which had the measurement of pion - nucleon scattering as a secondary goal .",
    "the sets used were :    * sigg *  the one atomic measurement by sigg et al.@xcite is very important in determining the low - energy behavior of the s - wave amplitudes .",
    "it alone fixes , to large extent , the scattering length of the @xmath8 -p system .",
    "we found that predictions of this scattering length from our fits to scattering data were always near to their value and , when included , the fit adapted itself easily to the value and usually fit it with a very small @xmath9 .",
    "thus we see no reason to question the validity of this point and have used it in all of the analyses discussed below .",
    "* brack *  the data from j. brack et al.@xcite seem to be of high quality .",
    "the smallest errors are ( in general ) those quoted in this work , which contains 62 data points for scattering of @xmath10  and @xmath8   at 29.4 , 45.0 , 66.8 and 86.8 mev .",
    "* frank *  the data from j. frank et al.@xcite were the first modern data to be published contradicting the bertin et al.@xcite data .",

    "this set consists of @xmath10  and @xmath8   scattering at 54.3 mev .",
    "our fit indicates that the cross sections for the negative pion data are too high by about 14% .",
    "* joram i *  the first paper of joram et al.@xcite presents data in the important coulomb - nuclear interference region for @xmath10  and @xmath8at 32.20 and 44.60 mev .",

    "* joram ii *  the data in the second paper of joram et al.@xcite present larger angle cross sections of @xmath10  and @xmath8  at 32.3 , 44.6 and 68.6 mev .",
    "the authors made single - energy fits to the data in the experimental paper .",
    "for the @xmath10  at 32.3 mev the best @xmath11 that they obtained , in combination with other data at this energy , was 121/58 , while for the @xmath10   at 44.6 mev the best was 95.6/46 .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the scattering lengths obtained from these single - energy fits lead to values of the @xmath12nn coupling constant outside of an acceptable range .",
    "we have not included these two data sets in our fit .",
    "we also have dropped the 53.42 degree point in the @xmath10  data at 68.6 mev which is completely out of line with the rest of the data .",
    "this leaves 32 data points in this set .    the data of bertin et al.@xcite were not included in the general fits since they ( or at least their normalizations ) seem to be inconsistent with the modern data .",
    "in order to make contact with previous analyses and get some feeling for the impact of the data sets , we make fits using the bertin data as the only @xmath10  data and the full modern @xmath8  data set described above . figure 1 shows the @xmath10  data around 50 mev compared with one of our fits illustrating the apparent discrepancy .",
    "at low energies and for each partial - wave , the @xmath10 p elastic process is described by a single - channel klein - gordon ( kg ) equation .",
    "the @xmath8 p elastic and charge - exchange scattering are described by a two - channel kg equation . that the effect of the ( @xmath13 ) reaction on the hadronic channels may be ignored was justified in ref .",
    "@xcite where this procedure is discussed in detail .    in fitting the data",
    ", we solve the kg equation by standard numerical procedures .",
    "the potential , @xmath14 , is included in the kg equation through the substitution @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the center of mass energy of the pion ( actually the reduced energy in the fits ) ; i.e. for both electrostatic and strong interactions , @xmath14 is taken to be the fourth component of a lorentz four - vector .",
    "the resulting equation is    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the center - of - mass momentum .",
    "however there are several calculations that we would like to make which include only the strong interaction ( the sigma term , the isovector s - wave amplitude at the cd point , and the off - shell amplitudes ) for which the coulomb force is not included . in this case",
    "it is very convenient to use ( for the s - wave ) the expressions developed by jost@xcite .",
    "we now give a brief outline of the method and its extension to the off - shell case .",
    "our potential contains ( at most ) two terms of exponential form .",
    "since the potential appears linearly and quadratically in the kg equation , a two - term basic potential leads to an effective schrdinger equation with a 5-term potential .",
    "consider the solution of the schrdinger equation for a sum of exponential potentials :    @xmath19    jost @xcite writes the solution for the s - wave , @xmath20 , as    @xmath21    where the subscript @xmath22 is a compound quantity consisting of a set of n integers .",

    "the solution with the proper boundary conditions at the origin with an incoming spherical wave and with unit amplitude at infinity is    @xmath28    where @xmath29 these expressions can be used to calculate the values of the s - matrix for any value of @xmath18",
    ". we shall be interested in purely imaginary values for the calculation of the s - wave contribution to the @xmath4-term .    in order to calculate the off - shell amplitude we consider the wave function for real ( positive ) values of @xmath18 . in this case",
    "we can write ( for real @xmath30 ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is real and positive .",

    "the subthreshold regime , the region below the elastic threshold , is of interest in studies of chiral - symmetry breaking , a measure of which is the @xmath4 term . on - shell",
    "subthreshold amplitudes have been evaluated over the years by the use of dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare those results with the values given by the kg equation .      because the `` experimental '' @xmath36-term is defined at the unphysical cd point ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , any determination of it is , to a degree , model or theory dependent .",
    "@xmath39-channel and @xmath40-channel data exists only for negative @xmath41 , therefore fixed-@xmath41 dispersion relations must either rely on the rapid convergence of the partial - wave series outside of the physical region at @xmath42 as in cheng and dashen s method or must use additional techniques ( such as dispersion relations at fixed @xmath43 ) to extend the amplitudes to @xmath42 .",
    "this extrapolation is complicated by the presence of the crossed reaction @xmath44 which produces a nearby branch cut in the t - channel beginning at @xmath45 .",
    "some knowledge of the effect of this cut is obtained indirectly from @xmath46 elastic scattering , but this analysis is , to an extent , model dependent .",
    "some formulations of the dispersion relation approach rely heavily on very accurate knowledge of the p - wave scattering volume@xcite when , in fact , the @xmath4 term is dominated by the s - wave amplitude@xcite .",
    "interior dispersion relations ( idr ) @xcite and hyperbolic dispersion relations @xcite have also been used to determine the @xmath36-term . in these cases , the curves along which",
    "the dispersion relations are written may be chosen to pass directly through the cd point .",
    "however , these dispersion relations involve integrals over the entire @xmath41 -channel cut , a long portion of which is unphysical ( @xmath47 ) . in this case , the entire @xmath41-channel dispersion integral ( the `` discrepancy function '' ) must be determined and extrapolated to the cd point .",
    "thus , even in the classic dispersion - theory determination of the @xmath36-term , some model dependence is present .",
    "it is instructive to compare the relative contributions of the @xmath39 and @xmath48 waves to the non - flip pole - subtracted amplitude @xmath49 which is real in this region and , as we shall show in the next section , is proportional to @xmath4 at the cd point . to this end",
    "we have performed the partial - wave projections of @xmath49 as computed from the subthreshold polynomial expansion in @xmath50 and @xmath41 from hhler et al.@xcite . for purposes of illustration",
    "we plot @xmath49 _ vs. _ @xmath43 along a curve of constant path parameter @xmath51 where @xmath52 $ ] is the kibble function , which vanishes on the boundary of the physical region .",
    "the parameter , @xmath53 , is fixed at the value @xmath54 .",
    "this path has the advantage that it passes through both the @xmath39-channel threshold ( @xmath55 ) and the cd point ( at which @xmath56 ) .",
    "it also arrives at the cd point tangent to a curve of constant @xmath41 as was specified in the paper of cheng and dashen .",
    "( this is the path used in idr calculations . ) for comparison , the @xmath39 and @xmath57 wave partial - wave contributions to @xmath49 are plotted along with the full amplitude in fig .",
    "[ sigmaps ] .",
    "the amplitudes have been multiplied by a factor so that they reduce to the @xmath36-term at @xmath56 .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath39 wave contribution is similar to the full amplitude @xmath49 between the cd point and threshold , becoming quite close at the cd point .",
    "notice that the @xmath39 and @xmath57 contributions cross slightly below the cd point , where @xmath58 vanishes .",
    "this zero in @xmath58 suppresses the @xmath48-wave contribution at the cd point@xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath59 at the cd point is    @xmath60    the value of @xmath41 for which @xmath61 is zero ( for @xmath56 ) is approximately @xmath62 which differs from the value at the cd point by about 1/2 of one percent .      in the present approach",
    "the subthreshold dependence is derived directly from the pion - nucleon data itself .",
    "the question of the validity of the function extracted then depends on the accuracy of the data and the suitability of the form used for the potential .    while the amplitudes produced from the kg model do not automatically contain the full analyticity and crossing properties of the invariant amplitudes , much of the same physics can be included by considering that the source of the potential is the @xmath41-channel cut ( @xmath63 scattering and @xmath64 ) .",
    "the potential can be written in terms of an integral over the discontinuity along the @xmath41 axis as done in the case ( for example ) of the @xmath65 potential@xcite    @xmath66    since a yukawa potential can be written as an integral over an exponential form @xmath67 the @xmath68 potential can be expressed as a sum of exponential potentials .    from the definition of the non - spin - flip amplitude , @xmath69p_{\\ell}(x),\\ ] ] and the projection of these partial waves from the invariant amplitudes @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see ref .",
