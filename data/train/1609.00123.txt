    "a tensor rank decomposition expresses a tensor @xmath4 as a linear combination of rank-1 tensors , as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is either the real field @xmath8 or complex field @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath1 is minimal in the above expression , then it is called the _ rank _ of @xmath10 .",
    "a key property of the tensor rank decomposition is its _ generic identifiability _",
    "this means that the expression ( [ eqn_rank_decomposition ] ) is unique up to a permutation of the summands and scaling of the vectors on a dense open subset of the set of tensors admitting an expression as in ( [ eqn_rank_decomposition ] ) .",
    "this uniqueness property renders it useful in several applications .",
    "for instance , in chemometrics , decomposition ( [ eqn_rank_decomposition ] ) arises in the simultaneous spectral analysis of unknown mixtures of fluorophores , where the tensor rank decomposition of the corresponding tensor reveals the emission - excitation matrices of the individual chemical molecules in the mixtures , hence allowing a trained chemist to identify the fluorophores @xcite .",
    "another application of tensor decompositions is parameter identification in statistical models with hidden variables , such as principal component analysis ( or blind source separation ) , exchangeable single topic models and hidden markov models .",
    "such applications were recently surveyed in a tensor - based framework in @xcite .",
    "the key in these applications consists of recovering the unknown parameters by computing a _ waring decomposition _ of a higher - order moment tensor constructed from the known samples .",
    "in other words , one seeks a decomposition @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 for all @xmath14 . note that @xmath10 is a _ symmetric",
    "_ tensor in this case .",
    "if @xmath1 is minimal , then @xmath1 is called the waring or symmetric rank of @xmath10 .",
    "uniqueness of waring decompositions is again the key for ensuring that the recovered parameters of the model are unique and interpretable .",
    "generic identifiability of complex waring decompositions of subgeneric rank for nearly all tensor spaces was proved in @xcite .",
    "we address in this paper the problem of _ specific identifiability _ : given a tensor rank decomposition of length @xmath1 in the space @xmath15 , prove that it is unique .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the variety of rank-@xmath0 tensors in this space .",
    "as it is conjectured that the generic `` generic '' with respect to some property in the set @xmath17 , if the property fails to hold at most for the elements in a strict subvariety of @xmath17 . ]",
    "tensor of _ _ subtypical _ _ coincides with the generic rank over @xmath9 @xcite , hence the term _ subtypical _ through all this paper coincides with the term _ subgeneric _ used in @xcite .",
    "] rank @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath18 has a unique decomposition , provided it is not one of the exceptional cases listed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , we believe that any practical criterion for specific identifiability must be more informative than the following naive monte carlo algorithm :    1 .",
    "if the number of terms in the given tensor decomposition is less than @xmath19 , then claim `` identifiable , '' otherwise claim `` not identifiable . ''",
    "this simple algorithm has a @xmath20 probability of returning a correct result if one samples decompositions of length @xmath1 from any probability distribution whose support is not contained in the zariski - closed locus where @xmath1-identifiability fails ( assuming generic @xmath1-identifiability ; see section [ sec_identifiability ] ) .",
    "it also has a @xmath21 chance of returning an incorrect answer ",
    "it _ can _ be wrong , e.g. , if the unidentifiable tensor @xmath22 is presented as input , but the probability of sampling these tensors is zero .",
    "deterministic algorithms for specific @xmath1-identifiability , e.g. , @xcite , merit consideration , however only if they are what we propose to call _ effective _ : if they can prove identifiability on a dense , open subset of the set of tensors admitting decomposition ( [ eqn_rank_decomposition ] ) . a deterministic criterion is thus effective if its conditions are satisfied generically ; that is , if the same criterion also proves generic identifiability .",
    "well - known criterion for @xmath1-identifiability is deterministic : it is a sufficient condition for uniqueness .",
    "if the criterion is not satisfied , the outcome of the test is inconclusive .",
    "effective criteria are allowed to have such inconclusive outcomes provided that they do not form a euclidean - open set .",
    "it will not surprise the experts that kruskal s criterion @xcite is effective .",
    "domanov and de lathauwer @xcite recently proved that some of their criteria for _ third - order _ tensors from @xcite are effective .",
    "presently , only a few effective criteria for specific @xmath1-identifiability of tensors of higher order , i.e. , @xmath23 , are  informally  known , notably the generalization of kruskal s criterion to higher - order tensors due to sidiropoulos and bro @xcite .",
    "in private communication , i.  domanov remarked that `` in practice , when one wants to check that the [ tensor rank decomposition ] of a tensor of order higher than @xmath24 is unique , [ one ] just reshapes the tensor into a third - order tensor and then applies the classical kruskal result [ ... ] .",
    "the reduction to the third - order case is quite standard and well - known ; '' indeed this idea appears also in @xcite .",
    "formally , it can be stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath25 be a partition where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 have cardinalities @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . let @xmath32 be the variety of rank-@xmath0 tensors in @xmath33 , and let @xmath34 be the variety of rank-@xmath0 tensors in the reshaped tensor space",
    ". we may consider the natural inclusion @xmath35 and then apply a criterion for specific @xmath1-identifiability with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "if this criterion certifies @xmath1-identifiability , then it entails @xmath1-identifiability with respect to @xmath16 as well . while this idea is valid , _",
    "applying an effective criterion for third - order tensors to reshaped higher - order tensors does not suffice for concluding that it is also an effective criterion for higher - order tensors_. indeed , since @xmath16 has dimension strictly less than @xmath36 one expects that the set of rank-@xmath1 tensors in @xmath37 constitutes a zariski - closed subset of the rank-@xmath1 tensors in the reshaped tensor space . as a result ,",
    "the effective criterion for @xmath36 might thus never apply to the elements of @xmath38 .",
    "this observation was the impetus for the present work and the reason why our results will always be presented in the general setting .",
    "our first main result , proved in section [ sec_reshaped_kruskal ] , can be stated informally as follows .",
    "kruskal s criterion applied to a reshaped rank-@xmath1 tensor is an effective criterion for specific @xmath1-identifiability .",
    "the reshaped kruskal criterion as well as the criteria in @xcite applied to a reshaped tensor can all be considered as state - of - the - art results in specific identifiability . nevertheless , combining reshaping with a criterion for lower - order identifiability",
    "may not be expected to prove specific identifiability up to the ( nearly ) optimal value @xmath39 . indeed , consider any partition @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "then , @xmath42 where typically the integers @xmath43 are such that a strict inequality occurs .    in the second half of the paper ,",
    "the reshaped kruskal criterion is considered for symmetric tensors .",
    "remarkably , in @xmath44 cases of small dimension as well as for binary forms this criterion is effective in the entire range where generic @xmath1-identifiability holds .",
    "we show that an analysis of the hilbert function yields another case , namely the case of symmetric tensors in @xmath45 .",
    "the second main result , which is proved in section [ sec_first_effective ] , can be stated as follows .",
    "[ thm_effective_crit ] let @xmath46 be the linear subspace of symmetric tensors in @xmath47 . then",
    ", there exist effective criteria for specific symmetric identifiability of symmetric rank-@xmath1 tensors in @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for @xmath55 that are effective for every @xmath56 where generic @xmath1-identifiability holds .",
    "these are the only cases we know of where effective criteria for specific identifiability exist that can be applied up to the bound for generic identifiability .",
