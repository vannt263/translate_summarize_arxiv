    "after many desperate attempts to prove that the cosmological constant must vanish , now we face an even more complicated problem . we must understand why the cosmological constant , or the slowly changing dark energy , is at least 120 orders smaller than the planck density @xmath0 , and , simultaneously , why its value is as large as @xmath1 . here",
    "g/@xmath3 is the total density of matter in the universe at present , including the cosmological constant , or dark energy , and @xmath4 .",
    "one of the most interesting attempts to provide such an explanation is related to anthropic principle @xcite .",
    "this principle for a long time was rather controversial .",
    "it was based on an implicit assumption that the universe was created many times until the final success .",
    "it was not clear who did it and why was it necessary to make it suitable for our existence .",
    "moreover , it would be much simpler to create proper conditions for our existence in a small vicinity of a solar system rather than in the whole universe .",
    "these problems were resolved with the invention of inflationary cosmology .",
    "first of all , inflationary universe itself , without any external intervention , may produce exponentially large domains with all possible laws of low - energy physics @xcite . and",
    "if the conditions suitable for our existence are established near the solar system , inflation ensures that similar conditions appear everywhere within the observable part of the universe .",
    "in addition to considering a single inflationary universe consisting of many domains with different values of constants , one may also consider a possibility that the inflationary universe may be born in many different quantum states with different values of coupling constants , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this provides a simple justification of the cosmological anthropic principle and allows one to apply it to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "if , for example , the cosmological constant is large and negative , @xmath5 g/@xmath6 , then such a universe , even if it is flat , would collapse within the time that is smaller than the age of our universe @xmath7 billion years @xcite .",
    "this would make our life impossible .",
    "one may wonder whether intelligent life could emerge within @xmath8 billion years or @xmath9 billion years , but we have no reason to believe that it could happen on a much shorter time scale .",
    "= 5.2 cm    since we are entering the age of precision cosmology , let us improve the order - of - magnitude estimates of @xcite and obtain a numerical constraint on negative @xmath10 .",
    "the investigation is straightforward , so we will simply show the results in fig . [",
    "negative ] .",
    "we find that the anthropic constraint on the negative cosmological constant is a bit less stringent than it was anticipated . if @xmath8 billion years is sufficient for emergence of human life , then @xmath11 g/@xmath6 .",
    "if we really need about @xmath12 billion years , as one can infer from @xcite , then the constraint is somewhat stronger : @xmath13 g/@xmath6 .",
    "however , the present observational data suggest that @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the use of the anthropic considerations become more involved . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the life of our type is impossible for @xmath15 g/@xmath6 because in this case the density of matter of the universe would be exponentially small due to its exponential expansion at the present stage .",
    "a more precise and rigorous constraint was obtained later by weinberg @xcite .",
    "he pointed out that the process of galaxy formation occurs only up to the moment when the cosmological constant begins to dominate the energy density of the universe and the universe enters the stage of late - time inflation .",
    "( by galaxy formation we understand the growth of density contrast until the moment when the galaxy separates from the general cosmological expansion of the universe .",
    "after that , its density rapidly grows by a factor of @xmath16 , and its subsequent evolution becomes much less sensitive to the value of @xmath10 . ) for example , one may consider galaxies formed at @xmath17 , when the energy density of the universe was 2 orders of magnitude greater than it is now .",
    "such galaxies would not form if @xmath18 g/@xmath6 .",
    "thus , anthropic considerations may reduce the disagreement between the theoretical expectations ( @xmath19 ) and observational data ( @xmath20 ) from @xmath21 orders of magnitude to only 2 orders of magnitude ! but this is not yet a complete solution of the cosmological constant problem . assuming that all values of the cosmological constant are equally probable",
    ", one would find himself in a universe with @xmath22 with the probability about @xmath23 .",
    "the next important step was made in @xcite .",
    "the authors considered not only our own galaxy , but all other galaxies that could harbor life of our type .",
    "this would include not only the existing galaxies but also the galaxies that are being formed at the present epoch .",
    "since the energy density al later stages of the evolution of the universe becomes smaller , even a very small cosmological constant may disrupt the late - time galaxy formation , or may prevent the growth of existing galaxies .",
    "this allowed the authors of @xcite to strengthen the constraint on the cosmological constant . according to @xcite , the probability that an astronomer in any of the universes would find a value of @xmath24 as small as @xmath25 ranges from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , depending on various assumptions .",
    "however , our goal is not to find suitable conditions for the human life in general , but rather to explain the results of our observations .",
    "these results include the fact that for whatever reason we live in an internal part of the galaxy that probably could not be strongly affected by the existence of a cosmological constant @xmath28 .",
    "does it mean that we are not typical observers since we live in an atypical part of the universe where we are protected against a small cosmological constant @xmath28 ? also , galaxy formation is not a one - step process .",
    "the central part of our galaxy was formed very early , at @xmath29 , when the energy density in the universe was 4 orders of magnitude greater than it is now . to prevent formation of such regions",
    "one would need to have @xmath30 g/@xmath6 .",
    "it may happen that the probability of emergence of life in such regions , or in the early formed dwarf galaxies , is very small .",
    "moreover , one could argue that the probability of emergence of life is proportional to the fraction of matter condensed into large galaxies @xcite .",
    "even if it is so , in an eternally existing inflationary universe there should be indefinitely many regions suitable for existence of life , so life would eventually appear in one of such places even if the probability of such event is extremely small .",
    "a more detailed investigation of this issue is in order @xcite .    in this respect",
    "the anthropic constraint on @xmath31 seems to be less ambiguous .",
    "but it is also less important since it does not seem to apply to an accelerating universe with @xmath32 . in this paper",
    "we will show , however , that a similar constraint based on investigation of the total lifetime of a flat universe can be derived in a broad class of theories based on n=8 supergravity that can describe the present stage of acceleration @xcite .",
    "this may allow us to avoid fine - tuning that is usually required to explain the observed value of @xmath33 .",
    "usually in all discussions of the cosmological constant in the astrophysical literature it is assumed that one can simply add a cosmological constant term describing vacuum energy to the gravitational lagrangian",
    ". however , it appears to be extremely difficult to do so in the context of m / string theory .",
    "all known compactifications of the fundamental m / string theory to four dimensions do not lead to potentials with de sitter solutions corresponding to @xmath34 . however , there are versions of the maximally extended @xmath35 @xmath36 supergravity which have ds solutions .",
    "they are also known to be solutions of @xmath37 supergravity with 32 supersymmetries , corresponding to m / string theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 solutions of @xmath35 @xmath36 supergravity correspond to solutions of m / string theory with non - compact internal seven ( six ) dimensional space .",
    "the relation between states of higher dimensional and four dimensional theory in such backgrounds is complicated since the standard kaluza - klein procedure is not valid in this context .",
    "it is nevertheless true that the class of @xmath35 supergravities with ds solutions that we will consider below as dark energy candidates has a direct link to m / string theory , as opposite to practically any other model of dark energy .",
    "moreover , these theories with maximal amount of supersymmetries are perfectly consistent from the point of view of the @xmath35 theory : all kinetic terms for scalars and vectors are positive definite .",
    "all supersymmetries are spontaneously broken for ds solutions of @xmath36 supergravity .",
    "these ds solutions are unstable ; they correspond either to a maximum of the potential for the scalar fields @xmath39 or to a saddle point . in all known cases",
    "one finds @xcite that there is a tachyon and the ratio between @xmath40 and @xmath41 at the extremum of @xmath42 is equal to @xmath43 .",
    "according to current cosmological data , the relevant @xmath38 space is defined as a hypersurface in a 5d space @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is the hubble parameter .",
    "its inverse , @xmath46 , determines time scale of the same order as the age of the universe , @xmath47 .",
    "one of the simplest solutions of @xmath37 supergravity is given by a warped product of a four - dimensional ds space and a seven - dimensional hyperboloid @xmath48 .",
    "a fiducial model where all scalars are constant is defined by ds surface presented above and the surface in an eight - dimensional space defining an internal space hyperboloid @xmath48 .",
    "this surface is given by @xmath49 , where the constant @xmath50 depends on @xmath51 and the metric @xmath52 is constant and has @xmath53 positive eigenvalues and @xmath54 negative eigenvalues and @xmath55 .",
    "a simplest ( and typical ) representative of @xmath35 @xmath36 supergravities with ds maximum , originated from m - theory , has the following action @xcite :    [ pot ] g^-1/2 l = -12 r - 12 ( ) ^2 - ( 2- )  .",
    "here we use units @xmath56 . at the critical point @xmath57 .",
    "= 5.2 cm    this corresponds to the case @xmath58 and @xmath35 supergravity has gauged @xmath59 non - compact group . at ds vacuum",
    "it is broken down to its compact subgroup , @xmath60 .",
    "the value of the cosmological constant @xmath10 is related to @xmath45 and to the gauge coupling @xmath61 as follows : @xmath62    a similar potential was obtained in n=4 gauged supergravity in @xcite , where ds solution of extended supergravity was found for the first time and where it was pointed out that it is unstable , being a maximum of the potential .",
    "the gauge coupling and the cosmological constant in @xmath35 supergravity have the same origin in m - theory : they come from the flux of an antisymmetric tensor gauge field strength @xcite .",
    "the corresponding 4-form @xmath63 in @xmath37 supergravity is proportional to the volume form of the @xmath38 space : [ lam ] f_0123 ~ v_0123  . here",
    "@xmath64 where @xmath65 is a 3-form potential of @xmath37 supergravity .",
    "according to this model , the small value of the cosmological constant is due to the 4-form flux which has the inverse time - scale of the order of the age of the universe . note that in our model there is no reason for the flux quantization since the internal space is not compact",
    "this makes it different from @xcite where the flux and/or its changes were quantized .",
    "the eleven - dimensional origin of the scalar field @xmath39 in the potential can be explained as follows .",
    "directly in d=4 @xmath36 gauged supergravity has 35 scalars and 35 pseudo - scalars , forming together a coset space @xmath66 .",
    "the field @xmath39 is an @xmath60 invariant combination of these scalars and it may also be viewed as part of the @xmath37 metric .",
    "the first idea would be to discard this model altogether because its potential is unbounded from below .",
    "however , the scalar potential in this theory remains positive for @xmath67 , and for small @xmath10 the time of development of the instability can be much greater than the present age of the universe , which is quite sufficient for our purposes @xcite .",
    "in fact , we will see that this instability allows us to avoid the standard fine - tuning / coincidence problem plaguing most of the versions of the theory of quintessence . to use these theories to describe the present stage of acceleration ( late inflation )",
    "one should take @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that the tachyonic mass is ultra - light , @xmath69 .    in the early universe",
    "the ultra - light scalar fields may stay away from the extrema of their potentials ; they ` sit and wait ' and they begin moving only when the hubble constant decreases and becomes comparable with the scale of the scalar mass .",
    "this may result in noticeable changes of the effective cosmological constant during the last few billion years .",
    "since the potential of @xmath36 supergravity with ds solution is unbounded from below , the universe will eventually collapse . if the initial position of the field is not far from the top of the potential , the time before the collapse may be very long @xcite .    from the perspective of the @xmath37 theory it is natural to consider a large ensemble of possible values for the fields @xmath70 and @xmath39 and study it . in the context of the @xmath35 theory one",
    "may also study a large ensemble of values for @xmath71 and @xmath39 .",
    "consider a theory of a scalar field @xmath39 with the effective potential @xmath72 in the @xmath36 theory ( [ pot ] ) . in order to understand the cosmological consequences of this theory ,",
    "let us first consider this potential at @xmath73 . in this limit",
    "the potential has a very simple form , [ simplepot ] v ( ) = ( 1 -^2 ) = 3h^2_0(1 -^2 )  .",
    "the main property of this potential is that @xmath74 .",
    "one can show that a homogeneous field @xmath75 with @xmath76 in the universe with the hubble constant @xmath45 grows as follows : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , in the universe with the energy density dominated by @xmath42 it takes time @xmath79 until the scalar field rolls down from @xmath80 to the region @xmath81 , where @xmath42 becomes negative and the universe collapses .",
    "this means that one can not take large @xmath10 without making the total lifetime of the universe too short to support life , unless the scalar field @xmath80 was exponentially small .",
    "but if the potential of the field @xmath39 always was very flat , then one can assume that the field @xmath39 initially ( or after inflation ) can take any value @xmath80 with equal probability , so there is no reason to expect that @xmath80 must be very small .",
    "this means that for @xmath82 the typical lifetime of the universe is @xmath83 .",
    "therefore the universe can live longer than 14 billion years only if the cosmological constant is extremely small , @xmath84 .",

    "most of the theories of dark energy have to face two problems .",

    "then one must find a dynamical mechanism imitating a small cosmological constant and explain why @xmath110 at the present stage of the evolution of the universe .    in this paper we studied cosmological consequences of the simplest toy model of dark energy based on @xmath36 supergravity .",
    "we have found that in the context of this theory one can completely resolve the cosmological constant problem , as well as the coincidence problem plaguing most models of quintessence .",
    "indeed , one simply can not add a cosmological constant to this theory .",

    "one could argue that the first stars and planets were formed long ago , so we may not need much more than about 5 - 7 billion years for the development of life .",
    "this would somewhat decrease our estimate for the probability to live in an accelerating universe with @xmath108 , but this would not alter our results qualitatively . on the other hand , most of the planets were probably formed at later stages of the evolution of the universe @xcite , so one may argue that the probability of emergence of human life becomes much greater at @xmath121 billion years , especially if one keeps in mind how many coincidences have made our life possible . if one assumes that human life is extremely improbable ( after all , we do not have any indications of its existence anywhere else in the universe ) , then one may argue that the probability of emergence of life becomes significant only if the total lifetime of the universe can be much greater than 14 billion years .",

    "so far we did not use any considerations based on the theory of galaxy formation @xcite .",

    "the bare cosmological constant , is a property of the theory rather than of a particular dynamical regime .",
    "that is why the increase of @xmath42 in such models entails the increase in @xmath124 .",
    "this , in its turn , speeds up the development of the cosmological instability , which leads to the anthropically unacceptable consequences .",
    "the @xmath36 model discussed in our paper is just a toy model . in this model",
    "we were able to find a complete solution to the cosmological constant problem and to the coincidence problem ( explaining why @xmath28 and why @xmath33 noticeably differs both from @xmath125 and from @xmath126 at the present stage of the evolution of the universe ) .",
    "this model has important advantages over many other theories of dark energy , but to make it fully realistic one would need to construct a complete theory of all fundamental interactions including the dark energy sector described above . this is a very complicated task that is beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "however , most of our results are not model - specific .",
    "for example , instead of @xmath36 supergravity one could study any model with the effective potential of the type @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "another example is provided by the simplest n=1 polnyi - type sugra model with a very low scale of supersymmetry breaking and with a minimum of the effective potential at @xmath129 . as shown in @xcite",
    ", models of this type also have the crucial property @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , this property is required in most of the models of quintessence .",
    "therefore it would be interesting to apply our methods to the models not necessarily related to extended supergravity .",
    "a particularly interesting example is the axion quintessence model .",
    "the original model suggested in @xcite has the potential @xmath130 $ ] , and it was assumed that @xmath131 . it was however emphasized in @xcite that this is just an assumption .",
    "the positive definiteness of the potential with @xmath131 and the fact that it has a minimum at @xmath132 could be motivated , in particular , by the global supersymmetry arguments . in supergravity and m / string theory",
    "these arguments are no longer valid and the derivation of the value of the parameter @xmath133 is not available . in @xcite",
    "the axion model of quintessence was studied using the arguments based on m / string theory .",
    "the potential was given in the form @xmath134 without any constant part .",
    "this potential has a maximum at @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "the universe collapses when the field @xmath39 rolls to the minimum of its potential @xmath137 .",
    "the curvature of the effective potential in its maximum is given by @xmath138 .",
    "for @xmath139 one finds @xmath140 and for @xmath141 one has @xmath142 , exactly as in the @xmath36 supergravity .",
    "therefore the anthropic constraints on @xmath10 based on the investigation of the collapse of the universe in this model ( for @xmath143 ) are similar to the constraints obtained in our paper for the @xmath36 theory @xcite . however , in this model , unlike in the models based on extended supergravity , one can easily add or subtract any value of the cosmological constant . in order to obtain useful anthropic constraints on the cosmological constant in this model one should use a combination of our approach with the usual approach based on the theory of galaxy formation @xcite .    in this sense ,",
    "our main goal was not to replace the usual anthropic approach to the cosmological constant problem , but to suggest its possible enhancement .",
    "we find it very encouraging that our approach may strengthen the existing anthropic constraints on the cosmological constant in the context of the theories based on extended supergravity .",
    "one may find it hard to believe that in order to explain the results of cosmological observations one should consider theories with an unstable vacuum state .",
    "however , one should remember that exponential expansion of the universe during inflation , as well as the process of galaxy formation , is the result of the gravitational instability , so we should learn how to live with the idea that our world can be unstable .",
    "also , we did not willingly pick up the theories with an unstable vacuum .",
    "we wanted to find the models based on m / string theory that would be capable of describing de sitter state .",
    "all models related to m / string theory that we were able to find so far , with exception of the recently constructed model based on @xmath144 supergravity @xcite , lead to unstable ds vacuum .",
    "so maybe we need to take this instability seriously .",
    "this brings us good news and bad news .",
