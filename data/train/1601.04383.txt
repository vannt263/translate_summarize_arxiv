    "we write the right side of ( [ eq : zqtheta ] ) in @xmath21 and see that it satisfies @xmath135 since @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "when @xmath22 , we have the lemma below .",
    "we replace @xmath78 by @xmath151 in @xmath109 and then rewrite ( [ eq : zetaquotient ] ) as @xmath152 from ( [ eq : chebyshevu ] ) , the polynomial map @xmath153 bijectively maps the arc @xmath129 , @xmath154 , to the biggest loop such as the one in in figure 3 when @xmath25 .",

    "we will find @xmath159 values for @xmath21 where the sign of @xmath125 alternates when @xmath7 is large and then apply the intermediate value theorem to obtain @xmath40 real roots of @xmath125 .",
    "lemma [ rootsp ] and the definition of @xmath125 in ( [ eq : htheta ] ) imply that if @xmath21 does not approach @xmath160 as @xmath15 and @xmath161 , the sign of @xmath125 depends on the two summands when @xmath162 and @xmath163 when @xmath7 is large .",
    "the second condition , @xmath161 , is given below .",
    "if @xmath78 is a root of @xmath109 then @xmath166 by the symmetry in the product definition of @xmath167 in ( [ eq : resdef ] ) , the roots of @xmath109 are distinct if and only if @xmath168 with the definition of @xmath109 , this condition becomes @xmath169 from ( [ eq : thetaineq ] ) , the equation occurs only when @xmath22 . in this case , besides the double root at @xmath87 , the remaining roots of @xmath170 are distinct .",
