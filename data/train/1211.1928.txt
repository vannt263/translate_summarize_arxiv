    "while built as a discovery machine , the lhc at cern has a very rich research program exploring qcd in extreme conditions .",
    "this program ranges from the fundamental measurement of total scattering cross section in proton - proton ( pp ) collisions at very high energies to production and study of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy ion collisions .",
    "one of the first and intriguing observations made by the cms collaboration@xcite is a discovery of long - range two - particle correlations in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath2 .",
    "the correlations are observed between two charged hadrons which emerge from the collision collimated in their azimuthal angle @xmath3 while being widely separated in ( pseudo- ) rapidity @xmath4 .",
    "remarkably , while not present in the minimal bias events , the correlations are observed in high multiplicity events .",
    "these are extremely rare events ( approximately @xmath5 of the total event sample ) in which the total multiplicity of produced charged hadrons is many ( 7 - 8 ) times larger than a typical multiplicity in minimal bias collisions .",
    "correlations , similar to the ones observed by the cms , were seen before at rhic in collisions of heavy ions@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon was dubbed `` ridge '' due to its shape on the @xmath6 data plot ( see below ) .",
    "an accepted explanation of the `` ridge '' at rhic is related to collective flow in qgp .",
    "the fact that a similar ridge structure has been observed in @xmath1 collisions may hint at an intriguing possibility that high multiplicity @xmath1 events produce a state somewhat similar to qgp .",
    "this question is however still open today , as much more data would be needed to provide a clear answer .",
    "recently , cms released its preliminary data from the test run of proton - lead collisions at @xmath7 per nucleon@xcite .",
    "the `` ridge''-like structure of di - hadron azimuthal correlations is again clearly seen in high multiplicity events , and its magnitude is significantly stronger than in the @xmath1 data .",
    "there is a theoretical basis for expectation that at asymptotically high energies hadrons and nuclei behave alike . at high energies both protons and heavy ions appear as dense clouds of gluons .",
    "the growth of gluon densities with energy is governed by the qcd evolution equations , which are universal for all hadrons .",
    "thus , from this point of view , @xmath1 collisions at very high energies are expected to resemble heavy ion collisions at somewhat smaller energy .",
    "it is however overly optimistic to expect that this regime has already been reached at lhc , and it certainly has not been reached for the minimum bias @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the rare high multiplicity events may represent the tail of the distribution where high density has been achieved already , but this too is far from certain",
    ".    the long range rapidity correlations may not be ( and probably are not ) related to the formation of qgp .",
    "however they are a striking feature of the observed data , and are very likely a universal property of a highly energetic qcd collision , provided the number of particles produced in the final state is large enough to probe such correlations .",
    "since the correlations extend over a very large rapidity interval , causality considerations@xcite ( similar to cosmological arguments behind baryonic acoustics and cmb fluctuations ) lead one to conclusion that the origin of the correlations is at very early stage of the collision , and in fact most likely in the initial state . without such early time correlations , relativistic particles separated by many units of rapidity flying out of the interaction region would be causally disconnected and uncorrelated . at the same time",
    ", high multiplicities of produced particles must be due to high gluon densities of colliding hadrons .",
    "we are thus naturally lead to a conclusion that the observed correlations are rooted in the high density qcd ( hdqcd ) .",
    "the nature of this relation is the subject of this review paper .",
    "there have been numerous publications proposing various mechanisms responsible for the `` ridge '' in aa and in @xmath1 collisions@xcite .",
    "it is not our goal to provide a full coverage of those .",
    "here we focus on correlations that originate in the initial conditions , or the wave - functions of colliding hadrons and their relation to high density effects .",
    "the main ideas reviewed here , appeared first in refs .",
    "( ) . we will explain how the theory of high density qcd naturally leads to the correlations of the kind observed in the @xmath1 experimental data .",
    "the mechanism discussed here does not refer at all to collective flow in the final state , and thus is not likely to be relevant for the explanation of the ridge in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we take in this review the point of view that although the origin of long range rapidity correlations is similar in heavy ion and proton - proton collisions , the angular collimation in the two systems is probably of a different origin .",
    "hdqcd manifests itself in the phenomenon of gluon density saturation @xcite .",
    "gluon densities grow with energy .",
    "the low ( bjorken ) @xmath8 evolution of gluon densities is governed by the linear bfkl equation@xcite , which leads to a rapid ( exponential with rapidity ) growth . once the densities",
    "reach the `` critical '' value , where the density of gluons per unit phase space is of order of the inverse of the strong coupling constant , non - linear effects in the evolution become important .",
    "these effects slow down the growth of the density , leading to gluon saturation , characterized by the appearance of a new scale @xmath9 , known as the saturation momentum .",
    "such a dense gluonic state is frequently referred to as the color glass condensate ( cgc)@xcite .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath10 , evaluated at the saturation scale @xmath11 for the lhc energies , is rather small , which makes many aspects of saturation perturbatively accessible .",
    "however , even for a small coupling constant , the fact that the gluon densities are high invalidates naive perturbation theory .",
    "the proper treatment of the saturation regime therefore requires resummation of the naive perturbation theory .",
    "the nonlinear generalization of the bfkl equation that resums the high density effects is known as the bk@xcite- jimwlk@xcite@xcite functional equation .",
    "this ( functional ) equation is strictly speaking applicable when one of the colliding particles is dilute , such as in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) explored at hera , or in proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "although this is not the case when both colliding particles are high energy hadrons , and the qcd description of such systems is still not well understood , we will be using the bk - jimwlk approach as a proxy to qualitative description of hadronic high energy scattering .    some aspects of relation of saturation physics with the ridge phenomenon have been reviewed in refs .",
    "the ridge was first observed in gold - gold collisions at @xmath12 at rhic by the star experiment@xcite ( fig .",
    "the initial measurement of di - hadron correlations was performed with a high momentum trigger particle @xmath13 , but subsequently the correlations were measured for both , trigger and associated momenta in the ( semi ) soft range . here",
    "@xmath3 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath14 is the angular difference between the momentum of the measured hadron and the direction of the trigger .",
    "the peak around @xmath15 corresponds to the trigger jet fragmentation region .",
    "the bump at @xmath16 is the usual back - to - back correlation .",
    "@xmath17 stands for ( pseudo-)rapidity of produced particles . for two hadrons with approximately equal transverse momenta",
    ", @xmath18 measures their relative momenta along the beam direction , or , in other words , relative energies .",
    "centrality dependence ( indicated in percents above each plot ) of the `` ridge '' clearly demonstrates the ridge in central collisions while it disappears towards peripheral region .",
    "further studies by phobos@xcite and star @xcite(fig .  [ f2 ] ) were performed with and without hard trigger and confirmed the appearance of the ridge and its essential ( semi ) soft nature .",
    "lead - lead collisions at @xmath19 at the lhc provide further information about the ridge in heavy ion collisions .",
    "with increase in collision energy , the @xmath20 range of particles that exhibit ridge - type correlations broadens significantly .",
    "cms has observed the ridge up to @xmath21@xcite .",
    "alice has also studied the soft ridge@xcite and their results on centrality dependence are shown on fig .",
    "[ alice ] .",
    "the standard explanation of the ridge in hi collisions refers to collective flow@xcite .",
    "particularly , angular collimation in @xmath3 can be attributed to the radial flow that boosts particles along the radial direction@xcite .",
    "one of the first pieces of data to come from lhc was the observation of ridge in @xmath1 collisions by the cms experiment .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) displays the cms data at @xmath22 .",
    "the left plot displays a typical minimal bias event .",
    "the right plot shows data on specially selected high multiplicity events .",
    "the pronounced `` ridge''-like structure in the near side ( @xmath23 ) region extending well beyond the jet fragmentation rapidity interval all the way to @xmath24 is a distinct correlated feature .",
    "it has never been observed in @xmath1 before , nor can it be explained by any of the existing monte carlo generators used to simulate hadron cascades .    as was mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "only one out of approximately @xmath25 events leads to extraordinary high multiplicities produced in the final state .",
    "it is this set of events that exhibits the ridge like correlations .",
    "importantly , the correlations are observed only between semi - hard particles with transverse momenta limited to the interval @xmath26 .",
    "high density qcd naturally singles out this interval as being related to gluon saturation scale @xmath27 , typical for such events .    following the initial measurement@xcite ,",
    "further cms studies @xcite have revealed that the ridge gets stronger with increase of final multiplicities : the ridge emerges at multiplicities of order @xmath28 and becomes more pronouned at 7 - 8 times the average multiplicity . although multiplicities in the relevant events are large , they are still very far off the typical multiplicities in @xmath29 collisions at rhic at @xmath30 .",
    "it is unlikely that radial flow plays a significant role in these events , and we will take in this review the point of view that final state interactions do not change qualitatively correlations produced during the collision . if this is the case , the forward angular correlations observed by cms require an independent explanation .",
    "preliminary cms data on the proton - lead collisions at @xmath7 from the lhc test run have been released recently@xcite .",
    "analysis similar to one performed by the cms in @xmath1 case again revealed the ridge - like structure in the semi - soft momenta interval @xmath32 .",
    "special focus given to the ridge s strength ( height ) as a function of the total multiplicity of produced charged hadrons , reveals an approximately linear relation ( fig .",
    "[ ppb ] ) , while the overall strength of the ridge is found to be mach more pronounced than in the @xmath1 case .",
    "to explain the origin of the experimentally observed di - hadron correlations one has to address two distinct questions : ( a ) why do the correlations extend over such a long rapidity range ; and ( b ) what is the mechanism responsible for correlating the observed hadrons within a relatively small angle .    as has been argued in ref .",
    "( ) , causality strongly constrains the time at which the correlations originate . in order for two hadrons separated by a large rapidity interval to be correlated at the time of detection",
    ", they must be correlated at very early times : at or just after the collision . as can be seen from the fig .",
    "( [ caus ] ) , in case of hi collisions , the maximal correlation proper time is _",
    "latest correlation_freezout exp(-/2 )    it follows immediately that the larger the rapidity interval between the two particles , the earlier the correlation must be formed .",
    "furthermore , the flatness of the ridge in @xmath18 indicates that all the correlations are produced independently of the rapidities of the particles .",
    "if this was not the case , the ridge signal would be weakening for larger rapidity separation between the produced particles , the effect that so far has not been observed experimentally .    in the case of @xmath1 collision ,",
    "the freezout time should be replaced by a ( typically very short ) time scale of parton hadronization .",
    "these arguments lead to the conclusion that the long range correlations are present just after the interaction takes place , while their production mechanism is practically rapidity independent .    in qcd",
    "there exists a very simple and natural mechanism which can produce such long range rapidity correlations - the approximate boost invariance of the wave function of a very energetic hadron .",
    "as we know from variety of experiments as well as from the bfkl theory , hadronic wave function at high energy is gluon dominated . since gluons are vector particles , their lorentz transformation properties are such that in a boost invariant state they are homogeneously distributed in rapidity .",
    "thus , the observed rapidity independence of the correlations could be merely a reflection of the initial conditions of high energy scattering processes as encoded in qcd .",
    "the angular correlations between produced particles are also to be expected on very general grounds at high energy .",
    "we will now explain the qualitative picture underlying these correlations .",
    "this is very general and does not rely on specific models of high energy evolution and/or hadronic wave function . in the next subsection we will provide more calculational details substantiating this qualitative discussion .",
    "consider high energy scattering of a hadronic projectile on a stationary target in the lab frame .",
    "two projectile gluons with rapidities @xmath33 and @xmath34 scatter on the target and are observed in the final state . as mentioned above , at high enough energy",
    "the wave function of the projectile is approximately boost invariant .",
    "thus the projectile gluon distribution at rapidities @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the same .",
    "the two gluons scatter exactly on the same target , and thus whatever happens at @xmath33 also happens at @xmath34 .",
    "if for a particular target field configuration a gluon is likely to be produced at @xmath33 at a certain impact parameter , a gluon is also likely to be produced at @xmath34 at the same impact parameter .",
    "this is especially true in the context of the projectile wave function dominated by the large `` classical '' weizsacker - williams field , since in this case fluctuations in the wave function are small and the gluon density _",
    "configuration by configuration _ is almost the same at all rapidities .",
    "the hadronic wave function at high energy can be computed in qcd using light - cone hamiltonian perturbation theory@xcite : @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the wave function of valence charges , that determines the distribution of fast partons responsible for the color charge density @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is a bogolyubov -type operator of the soft gluon fields @xmath39 , and the weizsacker - williams ( ww ) field @xmath40 is given in terms of @xmath37 via classical yang - mills equations of motion . for small ( dilute ) projectile b_i^a(x)=_y f_i(x - y)^a(y )",
    ",   f_i(x - y)= ,   b=1 . for large projectile",
    "the ww field is parametrically large @xmath41 , while the bogolyubov operator @xmath38 produces the fluctuations of the gluon field of order unity .",
    "thus for fixed @xmath42 the gluon density fluctuates very weakly around large average value determined by the classical field @xmath43 the smallness of the fluctuations is clearly helpful .",
    "although _ the wave function _ at different rapidities in a boost invariant projectile must be the same , the magnitude of the _ color field _",
    "( and therefore the number of gluons ) may differ at different values of @xmath44 for the same configuration of the valence color charge density @xmath37 , if the fluctuations in this wave function are significant .",
    "thus in the same scattering event there may be significant differences between particle production at different rapidities .",
    "still , although the quasiclassical nature of the state eq.([wf ] ) ensures long range rapidity correlations at large values of @xmath37 , it is not absolutely necessary . even in the presence of considerable fluctuations in the soft gluon wave function",
    ", one nevertheless would expect positive correlations in rapidity .",
    "the only really necessary condition is that the density of incoming partons is large enough , so that there is large probability to produce more than one particle at a given impact parameter ( we will quantify what we mean by `` given impact parameter '' shortly ) .    thus the long range rapidity correlations come practically for free whenever the energy is high enough so that the wave function of the incoming hadron is approximately boost invariant , and there is very little in the actual dynamics of the collision that can affect this feature .    by almost exactly the same logic we can argue that near - side angular correlations must be present between the final state gluons .",
    "indeed , if the two gluons hit the target at the same impact parameter , their scattering amplitude is determined by the same configuration of the target field .",
    "thus if the first gluon is likely to be scattered with momentum @xmath45 , the same is true for the second gluon .",
    "one therefore expects clear forward correlations for gluons that scatter at the same impact parameter .",
    "of course , the two gluons will not scatter always with exactly the same momentum transfer even if they hit at exactly the same impact parameter , since even a fixed configuration of target fields corresponds to a nontrivial probability distribution of momentum transfer .",
    "nevertheless , given that this distribution has a maximum at some particular momentum transfer , the angular correlations must be very generic .",
    "the above argument does not invoke the physics of saturation .",
    "nevertheless , saturation , if present in the wave function does affect strongly the gluon production . to better understand the expected properties of the angular correlations in the framework of high energy qcd ,",
    "let us briefly recap our understanding of the transverse structure of the hadron in the saturation regime .",
    "it is convenient to think of the distribution of the ( color ) electric field configurations in the target .",
    "the target wave function is characterized by the saturation momentum @xmath46 .",
    "the saturation momentum plays a dual role in the hadronic wave function . on the one hand",
    ", it measures the typical magnitude of electric field in the wave function , on which gluons scatter .",
    "on the other hand it is known that the field components with transverse momenta @xmath47 are suppressed in the wave function@xcite .",
    "this means that the electric fields in the target are correlated on the length scale @xmath48 .",
    "thus the saturation momentum doubles up as the inverse of the correlation length of target color fields .",
    "typical field configurations in the target can thus be thought of having , in the impact parameter plane , a domain like structure of fig .",
    "( [ domain ] ) .    now consider a projectile parton impinging on one of the domains or `` hot spot '' of the target , with electric field @xmath49 .",
    "while traversing the target field , the parton of charge @xmath45 acquires transverse momentum @xmath50 a parton at a different rapidity but with the same charge will pick up exactly the same transverse momentum if it scatters on the same `` domain '' .",
    "this of course results in positive angular correlation of produced gluons .",
    "we note that this simple picture also suggests that angular correlations at angle @xmath3 and @xmath51 have equal strength if the hadronic wave function is dominated by gluons .",
    "gluons belong to real representation of the gauge group , thus it is equally probable to find an incoming gluon with charge @xmath45 and charge @xmath52 in the projectile wave function at any rapidity .",
    "suppose for example that on a given configuration the color field in the target is in the third direction in the color space @xmath53 , while in the incoming projectile the gluon corresponds to the vector potential in the second direction @xmath54 .",
    "one can always write @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is positively charge with respect to color charge in the third direction , and @xmath57 is negatively charged .",
    "thus necessarily equal number of gluons in the incoming projectile have opposite sign charges and are kicked in opposite directions while scattering on the target .",
    "this produces equal strength correlations at angles zero and @xmath58 .",
    "this feature of equal forward and backward correlations was noted in refs .",
    "( ) . for quarks which carry fundamental charges , this degeneracy should be absent and the presence of quarks in the projectile wave function should skew the angular correlation towards zero angle and away from @xmath59 .",
    "the above general discussion provides an intuitive picture for the existence of correlations .",
    "our next goal is to see how this is reflected in the calculational framework based on hdqcd .",
    "as explained above , we will base our analysis on expressions derived rigorously at high energy for a scattering of a dilute projectile on a dense target .",
    "we do this for two reasons .",
    "one reason is the lack of explicit analytical expressions for the case of dense - dense scattering , although a significant advance in understanding of symmetric collisions has been achieved@xcite and an elegant numerical approach is being pursued in a series of papers refs .",
    "( ) . also , as we will argue later , the dense - dense scattering approach is not entirely adequate for study of correlations either , as it does not take into account the pomeron loop effects which in our view is crucial for quantitative understanding of correlations .",
    "the dense - dilute approach is sufficient for the understanding of basic ingredients involved in the calculation of correlations .",
    "the quantity directly related to the measured correlations , is the double inclusive gluon production amplitude .",
    "the correlations are computed as variance with respect to the single inclusive measurement : [ r ] r=/ here @xmath60 are the transverse momenta of the observed gluons , and @xmath61 are their respective rapidities .",
    "the experimentally measured correlations are normalized per number of produced charged hadrons , @xmath62 , however the quantity in eq.([r ] ) has a more straightforward interpretation .",
    "the expressions for single- and double - inclusive gluon production probabilities are known in the literature .",
    "we outline the derivation in appendix a , while here we quote the results .",
    "the single - inclusive amplitude for production of a gluon with transverse momentum @xmath63 and rapidity @xmath4 reads@xcite : @xmath64                         [ s(\\bar x_1)-s(\\bar z)]^{ab}\\,\\rho_p^b(\\bar x_1)\\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whre , as before @xmath65 is the weizsacker - williams field of a point charge .",
    "( [ single ] ) is easy to interpret .",
    "the projectile appears in eq.([single ] ) as a distribution of the color charge density @xmath66 .",
    "the charge density is a function of transverse coordinates @xmath8 only , since in the high energy limit all the charges are localized at @xmath67 and there is no nontrivial dependence on the longitudinal coordinate .",
    "the target is described as a distribution of the color fields which enter eq.([single ] ) through the eikonal scattering matrix of a single gluon @xmath68 when scattering off the target .    for a _ fixed _ configuration of the projectile charges @xmath69 in the incoming wave function , a ww gluon is emitted at a transverse position @xmath70 with the probability amplitude @xmath71 .",
    "this gluon and the parent charge both scatter eikonally on a fixed configuration of the target field .",
    "the production amplitude of the gluon is determined by the eikonal amplitude @xmath72 which describes the decoherence of the ww gluon from its emitter .",
    "the square of this amplitude gives the probability of the gluon production in the given event ( for a fixed projectile and target configuration ) .",
    "this probability then has to be averaged over the projectile and target wave functions - the projectile ensemble determining the distribution of @xmath42 and the ( independent ) target ensemble which determines the distribution of @xmath73 . in the framework of cgc ,",
    "the averaging over the projectile and target ensembles is performed with the weight functionals @xmath74 and @xmath75 providing the probability densities to find a given projectile and target configurations respectively : [ average ] _",
    "p , t = d w^p[_p ] dsw^t[s ] the weight functionals @xmath74 and @xmath75 are subjects to high energy evolution which determines their dependence on rapidity : = h^rftw . here",
    "@xmath76 is the effective hamiltonian of qcd at high energies .",
    "@xmath76 has to be derived directly from qcd and is the qcd incarnation of the reggeon field theory of the old reggeon calculus .",
    "the derivation of @xmath76 at the moment is incomplete . for processes involving the scattering of a dilute object on a dense one",
    "the limits of @xmath76 are known .",
    "the evolution of the wave function of a dense target which can scatter on a dilute projectile the relevant approximation is the jimwlk evolution .",
    "the complementary form of the evolution applicable for the evolution of a dilute target , which participates in the scattering on a dense projectile , is the so called klwmij evolution derived in ref .",
    "both of these limits include a tripple - pomeron vertex and effectively resum the fan diagrams of the pomeron calculus .",
    "the jimwlk and klwmij evolutions are applicable to the same type of processes , the asymmetric situation when one of the objects is dense and the other one is dlute .",
    "the two equations describe the process in different frames : jimwlk ascribes the evolution in energy to boosting of the dense object , while klwmij to boosting of the dilute one . a more general form of @xmath76 which includes pomeron loops is available in ref . ( ) , however it is not general enough to be applicable to dense - dense scattering .",
    "( [ single ] ) is not symmetric under the interchange of the projectile and the target , which reflects our treatment of the projectile as a dilute object . for a dense target , the eikonal factors @xmath77 are nonlinear functions of the _ target _ color charge density , which is the result of the resummation of multiple scattering on a dense target field . the projectile contribution to eq.([single ] ) on the other hand , is quadratic in @xmath78 , reflecting the fact that the gluon emission amplitude in the projectile wave function is accounted for in the linear approximation valid only for small @xmath78 .",
    "the double - inclusive gluon production in the cgc framework has been analyzed in ref .",
    "the general expression is rather long and cumbersome , but only part of it is relevant to the mechanism we discuss in this review .",
    "this is the part of the cross section where the two gluons are produced independently from two different showers .",
    "formally this term is leading in the limit of large color charge density of the projectile , @xmath79 .",
    "the relevant part of the double - inclusive production cross section is [ double ] = ( k )   ( p ) _ p , t  +   terms  subleading  in  _",
    "p    eq .",
    "( [ double ] ) does not include rapidity evolution between the rapidities of the produced gluons .",
    "it is applicable when the gluons are produced sufficiently close to each other in rapidity so that there are not many gluons produced in the rapidity interval between them .",
    "this is not a real limitation , since the rapidity evolution implies that this is the case unless the rapidity difference between the two gluons is greater than @xmath80 . for a greater rapidity separation one would have to include the evolution .",
    "the formalism for including the evolution exists@xcite,@xcite and an approximate numerical study in connection with ridge in hi has been performed@xcite , but we will not discuss this more complicated kinematics any further in this review .    it is straightforward to see that eq.([double ] ) indeed produces angular correlations . for a _ fixed configuration _ of the projectile sources @xmath81 and target fields @xmath73 , the function @xmath82 as a function of momentum has a maximum at some value @xmath83 .",
    "therefore clearly the product in eq.([double ] ) is maximal for @xmath84 .",
    "the value of the vector @xmath85 of course differs from one configuration to another , but the fact that momenta @xmath86 and @xmath87 are parallel to each other does not . therefore after averaging over the ensemble , @xmath88 has maximum at relative zero angle between the two momenta",
    "the strength of the maximum of course depends on the detailed nature of the field configurations constituting the two ensembles ( the projectile and the target ) .",
    "we stress that even though averaged over all configuration @xmath89 must be isotropic , there is absolutely no reason for it to be isotropic for any given configuration .",
    "thus , angular correlations emerge as a result of target / projectile averaging procedure over isotropic ensembles of anisotropic configurations@xcite .",
    "the simple formula eq.([double ] ) indeed encodes all the main features of the intuitive discussion of the previous section .",
    "the correlations originate in the initial state .",
    "they are clearly rapidity independent within the approximation in which one does not include rapidity evolution between the two observed gluons .",
    "as noted above , this is expected to be valid for rapidity difference @xmath90 .",
    "the correlations are peaked at the forward angle , but , consistent with our previous discussion , they also peak at the backward angle with the same strength . clearly , @xmath91 is a symmetric function of its argument .",
    "it is expressed in terms of the single gluon production amplitude ( k)=a(k)a^*(k ) with a(k)=_z , x_1 , e^ikz g ( x_1- z ) [ s ( x_1)-s ( z)](x_1 ) since the amplitude @xmath92 is real in coordinate space ( eikonal scattering matrices in the eikonal approximation are by definition real ) , it satisfies @xmath93 , and therefore configuration by configuration @xmath94 thus the leading contribution to the two particle inclusive production probability is symmetric under @xmath95 and must have two degenerate maxima , at relative angles @xmath96 .",
    "eq.([double ] ) also suggests that if one includes in the calculation hadrons produced from quarks , the degeneracy will be lifted .",
    "the quark production amplitude involves the eikonal matrix of a produced quark , which , being a fundamental representation matrix , is complex .",
    "thus the @xmath97 symmetry is broken by the presence of quarks .",
    "the overall magnitude of the correlation can be estimated from the following simple consideration . in order for the two produced gluons to be correlated in the final state",
    ", they have to be close in the initial state and also scatter off the same target field .",
    "in other words they must be within the smaller of the two correlation length that characterize the projectile and the target wave functions .",
    "the target and the projectile correlation lengths in the saturation regime are determined by the saturation momenta @xmath98 .",
    "thus for correlated production the two gluons need to be within the radius @xmath99 of each other , where @xmath100 is the larger of the two saturation momenta @xmath101 and @xmath102 . on the other hand",
    "the total number of produced gluons is proportional to the total transverse area of the smaller of the two objects participating in collision . thus parametrically@xcite",
    "@xmath103    our general discussion provides an intuitive explanation to the correlation phenomena and also makes it clear that the presence of the correlations does not depend on the specifics of the approximation used to estimate @xmath104 .",
    "the magnitude of the effect however may depend on the approximation quite strongly .",
    "in particular what one assumes about the projectile and target averaging procedure is very important .",
    "numerical calculations of correlations in the cgc approach have used the gaussian weight for averaging the projectile and the target charge densities .",
    "although the gaussian weight makes the calculations manageable and explicit , it has certain non - generic features which most likely skew the results of the calculation .",

    "the calculation of ref .",
    "( ) is performed in the framework of the projectile dipole model , while that of refs .",
    "( ) in the target dipole model .",
    "technically the projectile dipole model assumes that the projectile is dilute and contains a small number of dipoles , while the target is a dense system , while the target dipole model reverses the roles of the two objects . in terms of the target evolution",
    ", the projectile dipole model corresponds to the large @xmath0 limit of the jimwlk evolution , while the target dipole model to that of klwmij .    as discussed in ref .",
    "( ) the jimwlk and klwmij evolutions are very different as far as the target wave function is concerned .",
    "klwmij is the normal perturbative evolution of the target wave function .",
    "it is well known that in such evolution the number of gluons grows exponentially fast . the target gluon density , which in this regime satisfies the bfkl equation , depends on the total rapidity as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a number of order one and @xmath44 is the total rapidity by which the target wave function has been boosted from `` rest '' .",
    "the exponential dependence also holds for the differential gluon density in the wave function at any rapidity @xmath170 , namely ( we suppress the momentum dependence in the prefactor for simplicity ) @xmath171 gluons in the wave function which are separated in rapidity by no more than @xmath172 are expected to be correlated .",
    "since the gluon density in the wave function exponentially grows with rapidity , any projectile that probes such a wave function effectively feels only the gluons in the last rapidity `` bin '' .",
    "thus such a probe is sensitive to any correlation that exists between the softest gluons in the wave function .",
    "the rapidity dependence of gluon density generated by the jimwlk evolution on the other hand , is very different . as discussed in ref .",
    "( ) , while the probability to emit an additional gluon in the dilute regime is proportional to the number of gluons in the wave function , in the dense regime this probability approaches a constant .",
    "the evolution with constant probability of emission generates gluon density which is uniformly distributed in rapidity .",
    "this can be thought of as a random walk in color space as in ref .",
    "so now one has @xmath173 with @xmath174 a function of transverse momentum , but not of rapidity .",
    "it should still be true , like in the klwmij case , that gluons separated by a small rapidity interval are correlated , while the correlation disappears for gluons at very different rapidities .",
    "however now , as opposed to klwmij case , if one scatters any projectile on such a target , the projectile will sample gluons at all rapidities equally .",
    "thus , for example , if the projectile consists of two dipoles , the two dipoles will most likely scatter on color field components ( gluons ) with very different rapidities . since",
    "such fields are not correlated , the two dipoles will scatter independently and the two dipole scattering amplitude will not exhibit any correlations .",
    "another way of understanding the difference between the nature of jimwlk and klwmij evolutions is the following .",
    "in klwmij evolution one starts initially with the target wave function which contains a small number of gluons .",
    "the probability to emit an additional gluon in one step of the evolution is small ( @xmath175 ) , however if a gluon is emitted , the end configuration strongly differs from the initial one , since the number of gluons have changed by a factor of order unity .",
    "such evolution thus generates a very rough ensemble of target field ( gluon ) configurations . in this ensemble configurations with very different properties",
    "are present , albeit with small weight .",
    "such an ensemble exhibits large fluctuations in a variety of observables .    on the other hand , in jimwlk evolution the probability to emit an extra gluon is large - of order unity .",
    "however emission of an extra gluon produces a new configuration which is hardly distinct from the existing one , since the one extra gluon is produced on the background of @xmath176 gluons which already exist in the wave function .",
    "thus the jimwlk ensemble contains many configurations , but all these configurations have very similar properties .",
    "the fluctuations in observables in such an ensemble are very small .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect that klwmij evolution produces ( and preserves ) correlations ( and fluctuations ) between scattering amplitudes of two projectile dipoles at leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "these are indeed the correlations discussed in ref .",
    "( ) . on the other hand jimwlk evolution must lead to disappearance of any correlations initially present in the target ensemble , and this is exhibited by the results of ref .",
    ".    given that the two approximation to high energy evolution lead to such qualitatively different answers for the observable we are interested in , naturally one should ask which one of them , if any , should be used for quantitative investigations . naively one might think , that since we are interested in high multiplicity situation , the target is dense and jimwlk evolution is more suitable .",
    "this however is not the case .",
    "we expect the correlations to arise due to scattering at close values of impact parameter .",
    "the transverse distances in question should be smaller or of the order of the saturation radius @xmath177 .",
    "this means that the scattering occurs on the components of the target color field with transverse momenta @xmath178 .",
    "however at these momenta the target wave function by definition is still dilute . even for a dense target jimwlk evolution",
    "is not appropriate for all wavelengths , but only for those greater than the saturation radius . at large momenta @xmath178",
    "the appropriate evolution is klwmij and not jimwlk .",
    "thus to be able to describe fluctuations one needs to be able to evolve the high momentum modes according to klwmij while low momentum modes according to jimwlk . in fact , the situation is even more complicated .",
    "one expects that the largest contribution to correlations comes from the modes with @xmath179 of order @xmath46 , since in the relative distances of order @xmath177 should dominate the integral over impact parameter . for these modes",
    "however , the pomeron merging and splitting ( jimwlk and klwmij contributions ) are of equal importance .",
    "in other words , this momentum range is sensitive at the leading order to the pomeron loop contributions .",
    "we thus conclude that pomeron loops need to be included for proper treatment of this question .    the impact parameter independence of the distribution considered in ref .",
    "( ) obviously misses an important part of dynamics , as it largely based on hot spot picture of the transverse plane .",
    "the full picture should include the electric field @xmath180 fluctuating both in magnitude and direction throughout the transverse plane ( fig . [ domain ] ) .",
    "this study is currently in progress@xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there is another approach to angular correlations in the recent literature@xcite , that seems to be rather close to the one discussed here . in this section",
    "we wish to discuss it somewhat further , and also point out that superficial similarities notwithstanding , the physics described by the approach of ref .",

    "we will not follow ref .",
    "( ) verbatim , but rather will give our interpretation of the approach presented there .",
    "let us examine more carefully our original expression eq.([double ] ) .",
    "for the purpose of the present argument we will assume that the production is dominated by the part of the phase space where the charge densities @xmath181 are far enough from the emitted gluons , so that the gluons necessarily decohere and materialize in the final state once they scatter .",
    "this is essentially partonic picture of the projectile , where the gluons in the incoming wave function are assumed to carry only very small transverse momentum , and all the momentum in the final state comes from the exchange with the target@xcite .",
    "although this contribution does not account for all the gluon production , it is likely to dominate the correlated production at @xmath182 . with this assumption",
    "we can simplify our expressions by dropping the eikonal factors associated with the scattering of the valence color charge densities .",
    "the expression for double inclusive gluon production then becomes @xmath183 \\left[\\left(\\frac{p_j}{p^2}-\\frac{\\bar l_j+q_j}{(\\bar l+q)^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{p_i}{p^2}-\\frac{\\bar l_j - q_i}{(\\bar l - q)^2}\\right)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\langle \\hat n(l , q)\\hat n(\\bar l , -q)\\rangle_p\\langle \\hat t(k - l ,-",
    "q)\\hat t(p-\\bar l , q)\\rangle_t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath184\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) are operators on the projectile ( target ) hilbert spaces such that @xmath187    in the above equations we have assumed that the projectile and the target are both described by translationally invariant ensembles .",
    "although we have not indicated this explicitly , both @xmath185 and @xmath186 depend on rapidity , so that strictly speaking one should write @xmath188 , @xmath189 .",
    "note , that the physical meaning of @xmath190 is not that of momentum transferred in the scattering , but rather that of the initial transverse momentum of the dipole with fixed size @xmath191",
    ". thus @xmath192 has the meaning of * forward * scattering amplitude of the dipole with transverse momentum @xmath193 .    for single inclusive gluon emission amplitude we again quote eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) @xmath194\\langle n(l , q=0)\\rangle_p\\langle t(k - l ,- q=0)\\rangle_t\\ ] ] the double inclusive cross section can be written in terms of a natural generalization of eq.([sn ] ) . with minor abuse of notations",
    "we introduce an operator @xmath195\\hat n(l , q)\\hat t(k - l ,- q)\\ ] ] keeping in mind that eq.([nq ] ) is defined configuration by configuration for fixed values of projectile density and target field .",
    "this quantity ( up to kinematical factors ) can be though of as a pomeron extending from the projectile to target rapidity which is cut at the rapidity where the final state gluon is measured .",
    "the translational invariance of the target and projectile therefore restricts the contributions to the single inclusive cross section to zero momentum transfer pomeron . for double inclusive gluon",
    "however , only the total momentum transfer between the two pomerons has to vanish , while each pomeron individually can transfer a nonvanishing momentum @xmath190 .",
    "thus _ a priori _ , there are two distinct sources of nonfactorizability of the double inclusive cross section , and thus of correlations .",
    "first , is possible nonfactorizability of the @xmath196 amplitudes , and second direct contribution of the @xmath197 terms .    in the calculation described in the previous section@xcite , by limiting ourselves to the target ensemble translationally invariant _",
    "configuration by configuration _ we have limited ourselves to the @xmath196 contribution , and found that the initial correlations fall off exponentially with rapidity . on the other hand ref .",
    "( ) considers the effect of @xmath197 contributions within the framework of the bfkl evolution and finds correlations which survive at arbitrary rapidity .      within the bfkl framework at leading @xmath0 initial correlations",
    "possibly present in the @xmath196 channel , disappear with rapidity .",
    "consider for definiteness the target averages . in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", the solution of the bfkl ( or rather bkp ) equation for @xmath198 can be written in terms of the eigenfunctions of the bfkl equation for the single pomeron .",
    "recall that the complete basis of solutions of the bfkl equation is @xcite [ enn ] _",
    "n,,(x , y)= ( ) ^ + i  ( ) ^ + i where the complex coordinate @xmath8 is defined as @xmath199 the corresponding eigenvalues do not depend on @xmath37 [ eig ] _",

    "we have also assumed for simplicity that the integral over @xmath204 is dominated by the saddle point @xmath205 , since this corresponds to highest eigenvalue at every @xmath206 .",
    "this assumption is not strictly valid for arbitrary transverse momenta .",
    "in particular one expects that at high @xmath207 the saddle point will depend on the values of momenta@xcite , but we do not expect this dependence to change our argument . due to",
    "the presence of @xmath208 terms this sum contains angular correlations between the two densities . at the initial rapidity these correlations , as encoded in our initial ensemble determine the coefficient function @xmath209 .",
    "in particular , the initial distribution eq.([ini ] ) contains all even angular momenta @xmath206 . within bfkl evolution each term in the sum in eq.([rotat ] ) evolves with rapidity with its own exponential @xmath210 the eigenvalue @xmath211 is the standard bfkl intercept and is positive , while all other eigenvalues are negative . for @xmath212",
    "@xmath213 thus the @xmath208 contributions decay exponentially and after short rapidity interval the @xmath214 component totally dominates the sum @xmath215 for @xmath214 the function @xmath216 does not depend on the direction of momentum @xmath63 and therefore eq.([ty ] ) does not contain any angular correlations .",
    "the result quoted in ( [ expfall ] ) can be indeed identified with @xmath217 evaluated at a reasonable value of @xmath218 .",
    "this is indeed the origin of the exponential disappearance of angular correlations in ref .",
    "( ) .      ref .",
    "( ) considers the general case of @xmath197 and @xmath214 . in this case one",
    "has @xmath219 where @xmath220 and in the second line of ( [ tq ] ) we have again assumed that the @xmath221 integral is dominated by the saddle point @xmath205 ( @xmath222 ) . in general eq.([tq ] ) contains angular correlations . since @xmath36 depends on the impact parameter @xmath223 only in combination with @xmath37 , one can shift @xmath40 by @xmath37 in the fourier integral to obtain @xmath224 note that _",
    "= 0 ( k , q)=(k^2,q^2,kq ) this expression correlates the direction of @xmath86 with that of @xmath87 , through the dependence on @xmath193 .",
    "this is true even for the rotationally invariant target ensemble , which in the present context means @xmath225 .    in particuar ref .",
    "( ) assumes for illustrative purposes [ q0 ] -~(kq)^2   then the correlated part of the double gluon production is @xmath226    thus one finds correlation , which conforming to the earlier discussion has a peak when the two momenta are either parallel or antiparallel .",
    "since the expression in eq.([tnn0 ] ) involves only the bfkl eigenfunctions with @xmath214 , it has the leading energy dependence and in the dilute regime grows with energy with the double pomeron intercept",
    ". thus the angular correlations encoded in eq.([tnn0 ] ) survive at high energy .",
    "so it looks like the result of ref .",
    "( ) is very much in line with the qualitative picture we outlined in the first sections of this review .",
    "however , the situation is not quite that simple . consider a single pomeron amplitude at fixed impact parameter @xmath227 now suppose that the function @xmath228 has a maximum for some value of its argument , and for the sake of definiteness let us choose this value zero .",
    "then the integral is dominated by @xmath229 , and we get @xmath230 for small values of the dipole size ( smaller than the impact parameter @xmath40 ) @xmath231 this is just the rotationally invariant scattering amplitude of a small dipole on a density profile that decreases as @xmath232 . intuitively a dipole will scatter this way on an ensemble of fields , whose magnitude decreases according to coulomb law away from a central charge at @xmath233 .",
    "the ensemble itself is rotationally invariant , which leads to an isotropic scattering amplitude .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath234 we have @xmath235 so a dipole scattering in the center of the distribution again has an isotropic scattering amplitude .",
    "there is an orientation dependence only for dipoles of the size comparable with the impact parameter @xmath40 .",
    "this suggests the following picture of the `` target '' described by the amplitude eq.([t00 ] ) .",
    "it is a position dependent distribution with a center at @xmath236 .",
    "the distribution itself is locally isotropic .",
    "this means that it is not anything like a single electric field configuration , which has locally a direction in space , but rather a locally isotropic ensemble of such field configurations .",
    "the mean density of this ensemble decreases as @xmath232 away from the center .",
    "a small size dipole scattering on periphery does not care about orientation , since it again sees a locally isotropic distribution .",
    "a dipole whose size is of the same order as a the impact parameter probes different densities depending on its orientation with respect to the `` bulge '' of the distribution .",
    "thus the angular dependence here comes due to the fact that the * average * density is impact parameter dependent and it is the differences in the density that are probed by the dipole .",
    "it is of course not necessary that the function @xmath237 has one dominating maximum .",
    "one can imagine several broad maxima , corresponding to several centers of density distribution .",
    "on such a target again the angular dependence appears through the dipoles whose size is of the order of the distance scale on which the density varies .",
    "the amplitudes of small dipoles are not correlated in this approximation . in other words ,",
    "this mechanism of the angular correlations looks very different from the one we have discussed above .",
    "the difference is not just qualitative .",
    "the length scale that is relevant for the mechanism of ref .",
    "( ) is not the correlation length of the color electric fields , but rather the correlation length of the density . in other words",
    "the correlations should be maximal not at @xmath238 , but rather at @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the correlation length of the saturation momentum in the transverse plane .",
    "although naively one might think that the two are of the same order , this does not have to be case . indeed in a model considered in ref .",
    "( ) the latter correlation length is parametrically larger , in the high energy limit @xmath241 .",
    "this mechanism would then lead to correlations at very small transverse momentum .",
    "we have explained that rapidity and angular correlations are a very general feature of particle production at high energy .",
    "they are an almost automatic consequence of the boost invariance of the projectile wave function , provided the particle density / scattering probability is large enough so that there is non - negligible probability to produce more than one particle at fixed impact parameter within the saturation radius @xmath147 .",
    "there are good reasons to expect that the factorization of both projectile and target averages is broken _ at leading order in @xmath137 _ in the kinematical domain relevant to the correlated production of particles . to study this question one certainly has to go beyond simple rotationally invariant solutions of the bk equation , but more importantly , include pomeron loops in high energy evolution .",
    "while technically challenging , it would be very interesting to understand and quantify this effect .",
    "we expect the correlated production to be maximal at momenta close to the saturation momentum @xmath46 .",
    "it probes the hadronic wave function at transverse resolutions below @xmath147 , and should be dominated by @xmath242 for trivial phase space reasons . to be able to describe fluctuations at high energy",
    "quantitatively one needs to understand the evolution of the high momentum modes of the target fields in the dilute regime and the semihard momenta in the regime of the onset of saturation . in a sense one",
    "has to include the klwmij evolution for the high momentum modes and jimwlk evolution for the low momentum ones within the same framework .",
    "the situation is even more complicated , since one needs to understand the structure of the wave function around the saturation momentum , where the pomeron merging and splitting ( jimwlk and klwmij contributions ) are of equal importance and one can not just roughly switch from one description to the other .",
    "in other words , the interesting momentum range is sensitive at the leading order to the pomeron loop contributions .",
    "current numerical implementations ref .",
    "( ) do not include effects of klwmij evolution at high momenta , nor pomeron loops at @xmath46 , and as a result only include @xmath137 suppressed contributions to the correlated emission .",
    "in our view it is crucial to understand the effects mentioned above and include them in numerical calculations in order to have a theoretically robust and reliable description of correlated particle emission at high energy .",
