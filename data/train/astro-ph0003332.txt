    "since a few years , a new application of gravitational lensing in clusters of galaxies has started to be explored , namely the depletion effect of number counts of background galaxies in cluster centers .",
    "this effect results from the competition between the gravitational magnification that increases the detection of individual objects ( at least for flux limited data and marginally resolved objects ) and the deviation of light beam that spatially magnifies the observed area and thus decreases the apparent number density of sources .",
    "this effect was pointed out as a possible application of the magnification bias by broadhurst et al .",
    "@xcite where they suggested a new method for measuring the projected mass distribution of galaxy clusters , based solely on gravitational magnification of background populations by the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "in addition , they suggested that the mass - sheet degeneracy , initially pointed out by schneider and seitz @xcite and observed in mass reconstruction with weak lensing measures , could be broken by using gravitational magnification information which is directly provided by the depletion curves .",
    "this method has been used by fort et al .",
    "@xcite and by taylor et al .",
    "@xcite to reconstruct a two - dimensional mass map of abell 1689 in the innermost 27 arcmin@xmath0 , taking into account the nonlinear clustering of the background population and shot noise .",
    "the results are consistent with those inferred from weak shear measurements and from strong lensing .",
    "however , the surface mass density can not be obtained from magnification alone since magnification also depends on the shear caused by matter outside the data field @xcite .",
    "but in practice , if the data field is sufficiently large and no mass concentration lies close to but outside the data field , the mass reconstruction obtained from magnification can be quite accurate @xcite .",
    "this method is an attractive alternative to weak lensing because it is only based on galaxy counts and does not require the measure of shape parameters of very faint galaxies .",
    "in addition , it is still valid in the intermediate lensing regime , close to the cluster center , without any strong modifications of the formalism .",
    "meanwhile , it is more sensitive to poisson noise which increases when the number density decreases in the depletion area .",
    "another weak point identified by schneider et al .",
    "@xcite is that it may significantly depend on the galaxy clustering of background objects which can have large fluctuations from one cluster to another .",
    "a second application of the magnification bias that has been suggested is to use the shape and the width of depletion curves to reveal the redshift distribution of the background populations .",
    "this technique was first used by fort et al .",
    "@xcite in the cluster cl0024 + 1654 to study the redshift distribution of background sources in the range @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "they found that @xmath3 of the population in the b band is located between @xmath4 and @xmath5 while the remaining galaxies are broadly distributed around @xmath6 .",
    "the population in the i band shows a similar redshift distribution but it extends to larger redshift @xmath7 of objects at @xmath8 .",
    "the last application of the magnification bias that has been explored is the search for constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "this method is based on the fact that the ratio of the two extreme radii which delimit the depletion area depends on the ratio of the angular distances lens - source and observer - source .",
    "consequently it depends on the cosmological parameters , as soon as all the redshifts are fixed , and mainly on the cosmological constant .",
    "this method was first used by fort et al .",
    "@xcite in cl0024 + 1654 and in abell 370 .",
    "their results favor a flat cosmology with @xmath9 and are consistent with those obtained from other independent methods ( see white @xcite ) .",
    "this technique requires a good modeling of the lens and could be improved by being extended to a large number of cluster lenses and by using an independent estimate of the redshift distribution ( for example from photometric redshifts ) .",
    "however , this method was disputed by asada @xcite who claimed that it is difficult to determine @xmath10 by this method without the assumption of a spatially flat universe .",
    "he also mentioned the uncertainty of the lens model as one of the most serious problems in this test and concluded that this method can not be taken as a clear cosmological test to determine @xmath11 .    in order to better understand the formation of depletion curves and their dependence with the main characteristics of the lenses and the sources",
    ", we developed a detailed modeling of the curves in various conditions . in sect .",
    "2 we present the lens and counts models used in our simulations . in sect .",
    "3 we study the influence of the lens mass profile , with several sets of analytical mass distributions . in sect .",
    "4 we explore the influence of background sources distribution , selected through different filters .",
    "an application on real data is presented in sect .",
    "5 , in the cluster ms 10081224 , observed with the vlt .",
    "we compare these observations with the simulations in order to derive some constraints on the mass profile and the ellipticity of the cluster , as well as on the background sources distribution .",
    "some prospects about the future of this method are given as a conclusion in sect .",
    "+ throughout the paper , we adopt a hubble constant of h@xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the projected number density of objects magnified by a factor @xmath16 through a lensing cluster and with magnitude smaller than @xmath17 can be written in the standard form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number density of objects in an empty field and @xmath20 is the logarithmic slope of the galaxy number counts .",
    "note first that this relation applies only for background galaxies .",
    "this means that we implicitly work at faint magnitude where the foreground counts are reduced and do not affect the slope @xmath20 .",
    "note also that the magnification @xmath16 depends on the source redshift through the geometric factor @xmath21 in a significant way .",
    "for example , for @xmath22 , @xmath23 changes by more than 40%  when @xmath24 varies from 0.8 to 2 . for a lower redshift cluster lens ,",
    "the effect should be reduced , at least for all sources at @xmath25 .",
    "an exact writing of the magnification bias , which also takes into account the local effect of magnification , changing with radius @xmath26 within the lens can be re - formulated as : @xmath27 dz }   { \\mathrm{n}_{0}(<m ) } \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the density of galaxies of apparent magnitude smaller than @xmath17 , located at redshift @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 represents the shape of the luminosity function at redshift @xmath29 and we will assume in the following that @xmath20 does not depends on redshift , _ i.e. _ most of the faint galaxies are representative of the power - law part of the luminosity function . in addition",
    "we suppose that the slope is a constant with redshift .",
    "it is clear that the radial behavior of the ratio @xmath31 is strongly related to @xmath32 .",
    "it decreases from the center , up to a minimum at @xmath33 when magnification goes to infinity ( einstein radius ) and then increases up to 1 again , when magnification goes to 0 .",
    "this is the so - called radial depletion curve which has been detected in a few clusters already @xcite .    from the lensing point of view",
    ", the magnification @xmath16 can be written as @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the magnification matrix .",
    "the convergence @xmath36 and the shear @xmath20 are expressed in cartesian coordinates as a function of the reduced gravitational potential @xmath37 by : @xmath38 @xmath39 with : @xmath40 all these factors depend on the lens and source redshifts , as @xmath37 is related to the true projected potential @xmath41 by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a characteristic scale of the lens .",
    "in the weak lensing regime we have the approximation @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "so the potential interest of the depletion curves is that they trace directly the convergence distribution , or equivalently the surface mass density distribution . in principle",
    ", they may allow an easy mass reconstruction of lenses in the weak regime .",
    "we will see below what are the main limitations of such curves , already explored by athreya et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "different sets of models are used , with increasing complexity . in all cases",
    "we suppose that the lens redshift is 0.4 , with reference to the cluster cl0024 + 1654 studied by fort et al . @xcite . with the adopted cosmology",
    "this means that the scaling corresponds to 6.4 @xmath45 kpc for 1 . for each model we will use an analytic expression and develop it to compute analytically the magnification and its dependence with redshift and radius .",
    "all the models are scaled in terms of the einstein radius @xmath46 .",
    "this model is the simplest one which can describe a cluster of galaxies and is very useful for the analytical calculations of the gravitational magnification .",
    "however it has also some physical meanings :    * it corresponds to a solution of the jeans equation and thus it can be written as a function of the observed velocity dispersion ; * in a non - collisionnal description of the collapse of a self - gravitating system , the violent relaxation , during which particles exchange energy with the average field , leads to an isothermal distribution @xcite .",
    "but , this model is only valid inside certain limits due to the divergence of the central mass density and of the total mass to infinity .",
    "this divergence has no consequences on our work because the validity limits of the model correspond to the limits of the depletion regime .",
    "the density of matter can be written as : @xmath47 where @xmath46 is the einstein radius : @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the velocity dispersion along the line of sight .",
    "the gravitational magnification is simply : @xmath50      this model avoids the divergence of the mass density in the inner part of the cluster with an internal cut - off of the density distribution .",
    "we chose the following distribution , as described in hinshaw and krauss @xcite or grossman and saha @xcite .",
    "the density of matter is given by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the core radius , @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the central value of the gravitational potential .    in this case , the einstein radius is @xmath55 , where : @xmath56 the magnification can be written as : @xmath57 \\times   \\\\   \\qquad \\qquad \\left [ 1-\\delta\\left(1+x^{2}\\left|\\delta^{2}-1\\right|\\right)^ { -\\frac{1}{2}}\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    physically , in most cases the core radius is smaller than or comparable to the einstein radius , so we do not expect strong effects in the outer parts of the depletion curves .",
    "this model is a generalization of the sis .",
    "it can be used in order to test the departure from an isothermal profile far away from the cluster center .",
    "the density is given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the logarithmic slope of the density profile . in order to keep a physical model for the mass distribution",
    ", we must have @xmath60 .",
    "the einstein radius can be written as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the integrated mass inside the einstein radius and @xmath63 .",
    "the magnification is then : @xmath64   \\times \\left [ 1- \\left(\\frac{r}{r_e}\\right)^{1-\\alpha } \\right]\\ ] ]      this type of model is interesting as a lot of clusters have elliptical shapes in their galaxy distribution or their x - ray isophotes @xcite .",
    "thus , an elliptical lens represents a more realistic model although it is still reasonably simple . in order to study the effect of the ellipticity of the potential @xmath65 on the depletion",
    ", we introduced the singular isothermal ellipsoid in our simulations @xcite .",
    "using polar coordinates @xmath66 in the lens plane we introduce @xmath67 which is constant on ellipses with minor axis @xmath43 and major axis @xmath68 .",
    "the surface mass density can then be written as : @xmath69 where @xmath49 is the velocity dispersion along the line of sight .",
    "+ the convergence is : @xmath70 the magnification writes then quite simply : @xmath71      we introduced in our simulations the universal density profile of navarro et al .",
    "@xcite for dark matter halos which was found from cosmological simulations of the growth of massive structures .",
    "this profile is a very good description of the radial mass distribution inside the virial radius @xmath72 .",
    "wright and brainerd @xcite have compared it with a sis for several cosmological models .",
    "they find that the assumption of an isothermal sphere potential results in an overestimate of the halos mass which increases linearly with the value of the nfw concentration parameter .",
    "this overestimate depends upon the cosmology and is smaller for rich clusters than for galaxy - sized halos .",
    "+ the nfw density profile is given by : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a characteristic radius and @xmath75 is the critical density .",
    "@xmath76 is the concentration parameter and @xmath77 is a characteristic over - density for the halo which is related to @xmath76 by the requirement that the mean density within the virial radius should be @xmath78 .",
    "this leads to : @xmath79 if we take @xmath80 , the surface mass density and the shear of a nfw lens can be written as @xcite : @xmath81    @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the critical surface mass density . @xmath84 and",

    "@xcite to fit the redshift distribution of the galaxies in the range @xmath93 for @xmath94 : @xmath95\\ ] ] with @xmath96 and @xmath97 . here ,",
    "we extend the redshift range between @xmath98 and @xmath6 and we take @xmath99 objects per arcmin@xmath0 which is the count rate found by taylor et al .",
    "@xcite for red galaxies with @xmath93 .",
    "the distribution shows a maximum at @xmath100 and has an average redshift of @xmath101 .",
    "it is worth noting that with these parameters , the redshift distribution does not correspond to very deep observations .",
    "we also used a model of galaxy number counts from which the magnitude - redshift distribution in empty field can be computed with a large set of photometric bands .",
    "this model was developed by bzecourt et al . @xcite and largely inspired by pozetti et al .",
    "it includes the model of galaxy evolution developed by bruzual and charlot @xcite , with the upgraded version so - called gissel , and standard parameters for the initial mass function ( imf ) and star formation rates ( sfr ) for different galaxy types . in order to reproduce the deep number counts of galaxies , evolution of the number density of galaxies",
    "is included to compensate for the smaller volumes in an @xmath15 universe , following the prescriptions of rocca - volmerange and guiderdoni @xcite .",
    "this model reproduces fairly well deep number counts up to @xmath102 or @xmath103 , as well as redshift distributions of galaxies up to @xmath104 or @xmath105 @xcite .",

    "in practice we will limit our study in this paper to b , i and k bands ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "for our first set of simulations , we used the analytical redshift distribution for the sources , allowing a fully analytical treatment of the simulations .",
    "the contamination by foreground objects with this distribution is weak ( about @xmath106 of foreground galaxies for @xmath107 ) . in each case , we computed depletion curves , and then examined their behavior .",
    "note that we limited our analysis outside the first 20  from the center where the signal can not be constrained observationally ( decrease in the observed area for each point , obscuration by the brightest cluster galaxies  ) . for these reasons ,",
    "this `` forbidden '' area will be shaded in each plot .",
    "we used a sis model and varied the velocity dispersion @xmath49 from 1000 to 1800 km s@xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ dep_sigma ] ) . as expected the radius of the minimum increases with @xmath49 .",
    "indeed for a sis , the einstein radius scales exactly as @xmath108 , so the minimum of the depletion curve , which roughly corresponds to the maximum einstein radius ( at @xmath109 or more ) , also scales as @xmath108 .",
    "more surprisingly , the depth of the depletion at the position of the minimum is roughly constant and , at first order , does not depend on the velocity dispersion of the cluster or its total mass .",
    "part of this effect is due to the density of foreground galaxies , but part of it is intrinsic to this sis model , as other potential shapes do not show this property ( see below ) . on the contrary",
    "there is a clear dependence on the half width at half minimum with @xmath49 ( figure [ dep_sigma ] ) .      the introduction of a core radius in the model ( fig .",
    "[ dep_rc ] ) does not affect significantly the outer region of the depletion area and has little effect on the position of the minimum .",
    "as @xmath52 increases , the inner width of the curve is enlarged and its slope is decreased .",
    "in fact , the study of this area for our purpose has no interest , because the spatial resolution of galaxy number counts variations is by far larger than this scale .",
    "in addition , in rich clusters of galaxies , the central density of galaxies is large enough so that empty areas are quite small between the envelopes of large and bright galaxies .    in practice , the only observable effect of a core radius",
    "is a deformation of the inner depletion curve with a significant departure from a symmetry with respect to the outer part .",
    "but we suspect that a quantitative estimate of @xmath52 would be difficult to extract from the signal .",
    "the simulations are done with the power - law density profile , characterised by its slope @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ dep_alpha ] ) .",
    "the minimum position of the depletion area does not depend significantly of @xmath59 , because our scaling of the potential was fixed at the einstein radius , nearly independent of @xmath59 . on the contrary , the two other typical features of the depletion area ( half width at half minimum and intensity of the minimum ) strongly depend on this parameter .",
    "the width of the curve represents roughly the mass dependence with radius . in the case @xmath110 for example",
    ", the shallower slope of the mass radial dependence creates a larger width of the depletion curve .",
    "the half width at half minimum of the curve decreases when @xmath59 increases .",
    "the reason is the same as with the sis , that is to say , when @xmath59 increases , the mass is concentrated in the inner part of the cluster and the depletion effect is less extended to the outer regions .      in these simulations",
    ", we use the singular isothermal ellipsoid potential , with @xmath111 km s@xmath13 , and we study the depletion curves along the minor and major axis ( fig . [ dep_epsilon1 ] ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath112 does not affect the minimum value of the depletion area but leads to an increase / decrease of the half width at half minimum and of the minimum position along the major / minor axis as an homothetic transformation .",
    "the relative positions of the two minima of the depletion area along the main axis gives immediately the axis ratio and thus the ellipticity of the potential .",
    "an application of this differential effect along the two main axis is presented in sect .",
    "[ applims1008 ] .      with the nfw model we varied separately the virial radius and the concentration parameter .",
    "we have chosen the values for these two parameters in the range of those found by navarro et al .",
    "for the first set of simulations , we adopted @xmath113 and varied @xmath72 from 1800 to 3600 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ depnfwc ] ) .",
    "an increase of the virial radius ( more massive cluster ) leads to an increase of the three characteristic features of the depletion area and to the appearance of a bump in the central region which grows with @xmath72 .",
    "the increase of the half width at half minimum of the depletion curves with @xmath72 can be explained by the fact that when @xmath72 increases there is more mass in the outer regions .",
    "consequently , the depletion area is more extended to the outer part of the cluster and reaches its asymptotic value less rapidly .",
    "the second set of simulations was done with @xmath114 kpc and we varied @xmath76 from 7 to 25 ( fig .",
    "[ depnfwr ] ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath76 affects only the inner part of the depletion curves .",
    "an increase of the concentration parameter ( cluster with smaller characteristic radius ) leads to an increase of the intensity and position of the minimum with a steeper slope for the small values of @xmath76 .",
    "contrary to @xmath72 , the variation of @xmath76 does not affect significantly the half width at half minimum of the depletion area .",
    "in this section , we use a unique model for the lens , i.e. a sis profile with a velocity dispersion of 1500 km s@xmath13 for a cluster located at @xmath22 , to avoid effects due to the lens .",
    "[ nmzr ] shows the distortion of the magnitude - redshift distribution in the b band along the curve .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same in the others bands . near the cluster center , where the effects of the gravitational magnification are stronger ,",
    "objects located just behind the lens show a gain in magnitude larger than 1 . in the minimum area of the curve ,",
    "the competition between gravitational magnification and dilatation is more favorable to high @xmath29 objects ( @xmath115 ) . in the outer part of the cluster ,",
    "the effects of the gravitational magnification decrease and one finds again the distribution in empty field ( asymptotic limit of the depletion curves ) .",
    "we first studied the evolution of the depletion area with the redshift distribution of the background population by considering several filters .",
    "we tried to determine some characteristics of the redshift distribution of background population which could be connected to typical features of the depletion area ( fig .",
    "[ effet_filtre ] ) .",
    "the magnitude limits of the simulations correspond to a typical observation time of about 2 hours on an 8-meter telescope with good imaging facilities .",
    "the contamination by foreground objects @xmath116 in the 3 filters is weak ( @xmath117 in the i and k bands and @xmath118 in the b band for which the counts are deeper ) .",
    "+ the evolution of the position of the minimum of the depletion area reflects the evolution of the mean redshift of the different populations ( @xmath119 for the k band , @xmath120 for the b band and @xmath121 for the i band ) , but with a weak effect .",
    "the variation of the intensity of the minimum of the depletion area is connected for one part to the fraction of foreground objects and for the other part to the slope @xmath20 of the luminosity function . as this slope decreases from i band to b band @xmath122 with the magnitude thresholds",
    "we have chosen , the intensity of the minimum of the depletion area decreases in the same way from i band ( @xmath123 ) to b band ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "both features of the depletion curves are in fact weakly dependent on the choice of the filter and may be difficult to distinguish with real data , at least while the variation of the redshift distribution with wavelength is rather smooth .",
    "+ on the contrary , the half width at half minimum of the depletion curve is affected by the redshift distribution of background populations in a more sensitive way .",
    "the increase of the half width at half minimum from b band to k band is anti - correlated with the fraction of objects at high redshift ( @xmath125 ) for these populations which also decreases in the same way from b band ( @xmath126 ) to k band ( @xmath127 ) and seems to reflect essentially the bulk of galaxies at redshift around 1 .",

    "but as it is not in the most interesting region of the depletion area , we did not try to improve the measures there .",
    "in addition , due to the presence of two 11 magnitude stars in the northern part of the fors field , two occulting masks were put to avoid excessive bleeding and scattered light .",
    "we took into account this partial occultation of the observed surface for the radial counts above a distance of 130  ( see fig .",
    "[ ms1008b ] ) .",
    "this may possibly induce some additional errors in the last two points of the curves , which are probably underestimated , because of the difficulty to estimate the surface of the masks and some edge effects at the limit of the field .",
    "the first step would be to locate the cluster center .",
    "its position is rather difficult to estimate directly from the distribution of the number density of background sources , although in principle one should be able to identify it as the barycenter of the points with the lower density around the cluster .",

    "the count step was fixed to 30 pixels ( 6 ) in the innermost 80  and for the rest of the field we adopted a count step of 60 pixels ( 12 ) to reduce the statistical error bars .",

    ", we exclude the measures obtained in these innermost rings for any study of depletion effects ( shaded regions on figure [ depms1008 ] ) .",
    "we fitted the observed depletion curve in the i - band with three of the mass models discussed above , namely a singular isothermal sphere , a power - law density profile and a nfw profile , and with the galaxy distribution described in  [ countmodel ] . for each model ,",
    "a @xmath141 minimization was introduced to derive the best fits and their related parameters ( table [ chi2table ] ) .",

    "a second fit was done after removing some clear deviant points ( @xmath143 ) : the last two points probably poorly corrected from edge effects , and those associated to the overdensity seen at @xmath144 .",
    "this bump is easily identifiable in the v , r and i curves , and can be partly explained by the presence of a background cluster lensed by ms10081224 and identified by athreya et al .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , even if we remove from our data all the lower right quadrant of the field where this structure is located , the bump is still there although significantly reduced .",
    "this suggests that it may be more extended behind the cluster center than initially suspected .",

    "@xcite ( @xmath146 km s@xmath13 ) but is more discordant with the value of 900 km s@xmath13 inferred from the shear analysis of athreya et al .",
    "the slope of the potential fit with a power - law density profile is close to an isothermal one ( @xmath147 ) , although slightly shallower .",

    "this is due to the fact that for this magnitude range the logarithmic slope of the counts is close to the critical value 0.4 and the depletion effect is strongly attenuated .",
    "probing fainter objects in this band ( @xmath1 ) , even beyond the completeness limit , strengthens the depletion signal again , as it is shown in figure [ ms1008deepb ] .",
    "in addition this deeper magnitude range may be used to scan a different redshift distribution with a higher density of high redshift objects .",
    "this is one of the future prospects of the depletion curve analysis to perform a multi - wavelength analysis to try to disentangle lensing effects from the statistical distribution of the sources .",
    "we have also used the depletion effect to determine the orientation of the main axis and the ellipticity of ms10081224 . for this purpose , we divided the area of the fors field into four quadrants where quadrants 1 and 2 are in opposition , and we performed the counts for radial distances from the cluster center to 130(fig .",
    "[ ms1008b ] ) .",
    "the positions of the four quadrants are marked by @xmath162 , the clockwise angle between the north - south axis and the median of quadrant 1 .",
    "we then computed the depletion curves corresponding to the counts in quadrants 1 + 2 and 3 + 4 .",
    "we varied @xmath162 and followed the shift of the minimum position of the depletion area of the two curves .",
    "we can measure the orientation of the two main axis when the shift between the two minima is maximum .",
    "for this value of @xmath162 , the relative positions of the two minima give the main axis ratio and consequently the ellipticity .",
    "the results , obtained from i - band data only , are similar in the others bands . from the i - band data only , we found @xmath163 and an ellipticity of @xmath164 ( fig .",
    "[ epsilonms1008 ] ) .",
    "these results agree well with the mass map orientation derived from weak lensing as well as the galaxy number density map @xcite .",
    "a small discrepancy arrises with the x - ray gas distribution which orientation is shifted a few 10 to 20 degrees west from our measure @xcite .",
    "but globally , all these results are consistent within each other .",
    "the gravitational magnification by cluster lenses represents an effective tool to probe the distant universe and the mass distribution in the lenses .",
    "the first aim of this paper was to study the effects of lens mass profile model parameters on the typical features of depletion curves .",
    "we have also attempted to characterize some features associated with the background redshift distribution of the galaxies .",
    "models were constructed in three bands covering a large spectral range and by using five different lens models .",
    "our simulations agree well with very deep and high quality images of the cluster ms10081224 obtained with the vlt and fors .",
    "the depletion effect is clearly seen in this cluster , and we have fitted its radial variation with several sets of mass profiles .",
    "the results are quite satisfying as we are able to constrain the mass profile up to a reasonable distance from the center ( about 200 , or equivalently 1.1 @xmath45 mpc ) .",
    "our results marginally favor the nfw mass profile over the isothermal profile , and more significantly reject a power - law distribution , essentially because of the steep rise of the depletion curve just after its minimum . note",
    "that this region corresponds to the `` intermediate '' lensing regime , where shear measurements are more difficult to relate to the mass distribution .",
    "we have also studied the shape of the depletion area , which is easy to relate to the ellipticity of the mass distribution .",
    "we were then able to constrain the ellipticity and orientation of the potential of ms10081224 with a good accuracy .",
    "this preliminary study highlights the need for additional exploration of several issues not fully explored in the present paper .",
    "for example , the question of clustering of the background sources still remains , although in the case of ms10081224 , we have shown how it can be partly eliminated .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also mention this problem and insist on the fact that , at deep magnitudes , the two point correlation function of the sources is still quite uncertain , but a positive signal does not seem to extend much above @xmath165 1 .",
    "more quantitatively , we can use the most recent measures of the two point correlation function from the hdf - south @xcite . at the magnitude limits used in our paper ,",
    "this correlation function does not exceed a few percent for an angular separation of 10 , typical of our bin size .",
    "previous measurements were less optimistic in the sense that their values attained 8 to 10 %  at 10 , even at very faint magnitudes .",
    "but although there is still only poor knowledge of the amplitude of the correlation function at the faintest levels , we can hope that the effect will not be dramatic in our studies of the magnification bias , provided we retain a reasonable bin size at several arcseconds , to wash out most of the inhomogeneities .",
    "following preliminary approaches from the observational point of view @xcite or a more theoretical one @xcite , one now clearly needs to extensively and quantitatively compare the weak lensing approach with the magnification bias .",
    "in particular , with the new facilities of deep wide - field imaging presently available , most of the difficulties related to a small field - of - view can be overcome : for weak lensing measurement , a complete mass reconstruction requires shear measurements up to the `` no - shear '' region in the outer parts of the cluster to integrate the mass inwards .",
    "the absolute normalization of the field number counts for the magnification bias can also be estimated outside the cluster , in exactly the same observing conditions ( filter , magnitude limit , seeing ,  ) , giving an absolute calibration of the depletion effect .",
    "moreover , the full 2d mass reconstruction of the cluster from the depletion signal alone should be tested .",
    "as the signal is directly related to the magnification @xmath166 , and then to @xmath167 and @xmath168 , it should be in principle feasible to invert the depletion map to produce a non - parametric mass map . in practice ,",
    "the reconstruction is simpler as soon as the shear @xmath20 becomes small , because in that case @xmath16 and @xmath36 are simply linearly related . in any case , we have shown in this paper that it is rather easy to reach the outer parts of the cluster up to mpc scales .",
    "this is quite similar to what can be done with deep x - ray maps for intermediate redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "we want to insist on the fact that the magnification bias effect is easy to detect from the observational point of view because it is less sensitive to seeing conditions or to geometrical distortions of the instruments than are shear measurements @xcite .",
    "it only requires deeper observations , not necessarily in photometric conditions , provided one is able to reach the outer parts of the cluster to normalise the number counts . in order to improve the mass reconstruction ,",
    "one may progress with the help of photometric redshifts , quite useful for faint objects , to constrain the redshift distribution of the sources @xcite .",
    "this approach might also be useful in order to limit the influence of large scale over - density fluctuations when evaluating the magnification and the asymptotic limit of the depletion curves .",
    "this of course requires deep multi - color photometry , such as the one obtained on ms10081224 .",
    "extending this study up to large - scale structures ( lss ) would probably be more difficult to implement as compared to the search for cosmic shear @xcite , and the depletion effect should be restricted to cluster scales , at least with the simple method used in this paper .    finally , one of our initial prospects was to try to constrain the background redshift distribution with multi - wavelength observations of the depletion effect .",
    "we have shown that this is quite a difficult task as the wavelength dependence of the depletion curves is a kind of second order effect .",
    "nevertheless , this may be an interesting point to explore at other wavelengths , where the background redshift distribution is quite different than in the optical .",
    "for example , deep iso observations in the mid - ir of a few cluster lenses @xcite may represent an extension of our analysis , as well as submm observations with scuba , provided enough sources are detected behind the lenses for a statistical analysis .",
    "another possibility would be to address the question of the nature of the x - ray background sources and their redshift distribution through deep and high resolution observations of clusters with the new x - ray satellites chandra and xmm @xcite .",
