    "domineering or crosscram is a game invented by gran andersson and introduced to the public in @xcite .",
    "two players , say vera and hepzibah , have vertical and horizontal dominoes respectively .",
    "they start with a board consisting of some subset of the square lattice and take turns placing dominoes until one of them can no longer move . for instance , the @xmath0 board is a win for the first player , since whoever places a domino there makes another space for herself while blocking the other player s moves .",
    "a beautiful theory of combinatorial games of this kind , where both players have perfect information , is expounded in @xcite .",
    "much of its power comes from dividing a game into smaller subgames , where a player has to choose which subgame to make a move in .",
    "such a combination is called a _",
    "disjunctive sum_. in domineering this happens by dividing the remaining space into several components , so that each player must choose in which component to place a domino .",
    "each game is either a win for vera , regardless of who goes first , or hepzibah regardless of who goes first , or the first player regardless of who it is , or the second regardless of who it is .",
    "these correspond to a value @xmath1 which is positive , negative , fuzzy , or zero , i.e.  @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 .",
    "( by convention vera and hepzibah are the left and right players , and wins for them are positive and negative respectively . )",
    "however , we will often abbreviate these values as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 .",
    "we hope this will not confuse the reader too much .    in this paper , we find who wins domineering on all rectangles , cylinders , and tori of width 2 , 3 , 5 , and 7 .",
    "we also obtain bounds on boards of width 4 , 7 , 9 , and 11 , and partial results on many others .",
    "we also comment briefly on toroidal and cylindrical boards .",
    "note that this is a much coarser question than calculating the actual game - theoretic values of these boards , which determine how they act when disjunctively summed with other games .",
    "berlekamp @xcite has found exact values for @xmath10 rectangles with @xmath11 odd , and approximate values to within an infinitesimal or ` ish ' ( which unfortunately can change who wins in unusual situations ) for other positions of width 2 and 3 . in terms of who wins ,",
    "the @xmath12 board and many other small boards were recently solved by breuker , uiterwijk and van den herik using a computer search with a good system of transposition tables in @xcite .",
    "we make use of these results below .",
    "on boards of width 2 , it is natural to consider dividing it into two smaller boards of width 2 . at first glance ,",
    "vera ( the vertical player ) has greater power , since she can choose where to do this .",
    "however , she can only take full advantage of this if she goes first .",
    "hepzibah ( the horizontal player ) has a greater power , since whether she goes first or second , she can divide a game into two simply by _ not _ placing a domino across their boundary .",
    "we will see that , for sufficiently large @xmath11 , this gives hepzibah the upper hand .",
    "we will abbreivate the value of the @xmath10 game as @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "let s look at what happens when vera goes first , and divides a board of length @xmath14 into one of length @xmath15 and one of length @xmath11 .",
    "if she can win on both these games , i.e.  if @xmath16=[n]=v$ ] , clearly she wins .",
    "if @xmath16=v$ ] and @xmath13={{\\rm 2nd}}$ ] , hepzibah will eventually lose in @xmath16 $ ] and be forced to play in @xmath13 $ ] , whereupon vera replies there and wins .",
    "finally , if @xmath16=[n]={{\\rm 2nd}}$ ] , vera replies to hepzibah in both and wins .",
    "since vera can win if she goes first , @xmath17 $ ] must be a win either for the first player or for v. this gives us the following table for combining boards of lengths @xmath15 and @xmath11 into boards of length @xmath14 : @xmath18 & { { \\rm 2nd } } & v \\\\",
    "\\hline       { { \\rm 2nd } } & { { \\rm 1st}}\\mbox { or } v & { { \\rm 1st}}\\mbox { or } v \\\\        v & { { \\rm 1st}}\\mbox { or } v & { { \\rm 1st}}\\mbox { or } v   \\end{array } \\label{tab1}\\ ] ]",
    "this table can be summarized by the equation @xmath19 \\ge 0 $ and",

    "! > 0$. } \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ]    hepzibah has a similar set of tools at her disposal . by declining to ever place a domino across their boundaries",
    ", she can effectively play @xmath20 $ ] as a sum of @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] for whichever @xmath15 and @xmath11 are the most convenient .",
    "if hepzibah goes first , she can win whenever @xmath16={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] and either @xmath13={{\\rm 2nd}}$ ] or @xmath13=h$ ] , by playing first in @xmath16 $ ] and replying to vera in @xmath13 $ ] . if @xmath16=[n]=h$ ] she wins whether she goes first or second , and if @xmath16={{\\rm 2nd}}$ ] and @xmath13=h$ ] , the same is true since she plays in @xmath13 $ ] and replies to vera in @xmath16 $ ] . finally ,",
    "if @xmath16=[n]={{\\rm 2nd}}$ ] , she can win if she goes second by replying to vera in both games .",

    "these two tables alone , in conjunction with some search by hand and by computer , allow us to determine the following values .",
    "values derived from smaller games using tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] are shown in plain , while those found in other ways , such as david wolfe s gamesman s toolkit @xcite , our own search program , or berlekamp s solution for odd lengths @xcite are shown in bold .",
    "@xmath23 in fact , @xmath13 $ ] is a win for hepzibah for all @xmath24 .",
    "some discussion is in order .",
    "once we know that @xmath25=h$ ] , we have @xmath26=h$ ] for all @xmath27 by table [ tab2 ] . combining tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] gives @xmath28=[7]={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] , since these are both @xmath8 or @xmath29 and @xmath8 or @xmath7 .",
    "a similar argument gives @xmath30=[11]={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] and @xmath31=[15]={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] , once we learn through search that @xmath32={{\\rm 2nd}}$ ] ( which is rather surprising , and breaks an apparent periodicity of order 4 ) .",
    "combining @xmath32 $ ] with multiples of 4 and with itself gives @xmath33=[26 + 4k]=[39 + 4k]=h$ ] for @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath34 , we have @xmath35=h$ ] since it is both @xmath8 or @xmath7 and @xmath9 or @xmath7 , giving @xmath36=h$ ] since 39=26 + 13 .    since @xmath37 , we have @xmath38={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] since it is both @xmath8 or @xmath29 and @xmath8 or @xmath7 . similarly @xmath39 and @xmath40 so @xmath41=[27]={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] .",
    "a computer search gives @xmath42=h$ ] , and since @xmath43 we have @xmath44=h$ ] .",
    "so far , we have gotten away without using the real power of game theory . however , for @xmath45 $ ] we have found no elementary proof , and it is too large for our search program .",
    "therefore , we turn to berlekamp s beautiful solution for @xmath10 domineering when @xmath11 is odd ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , evaluate it with the gamesman s toolkit @xcite , and find the following ( see refs .",

    "this closes the last loophole , telling us who wins the @xmath10 game for all @xmath11 .",
    "the situation for rectangles of width 3 is much simpler .",
    "while equation  [ eqn1 ] no longer holds since vera can not divide the board in two with her first move , equation  [ eqn2 ] holds for all widths , since hepzibah can choose not to cross a vertical boundary between two games .",
    "a quick search shows that @xmath47=h$ ] for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , so we have for width 3 @xmath50=v$ , $ [ 2]=[3]={{\\rm 1st}}$ , and $ [ n]=h$ for all",

    ". however , we have some partial results on other widths . for width 4 , uiterwijk and van den herik ( refs .",

    "as a general method , whenever we can find a length for which hepzibah wins by some positive number of moves ( rather than by an infinitesimal ) , then she wins on any board long enough to contain a sufficient number of copies of this one to overcome whatever advantage vera might have on smaller boards . game - theoretically , if @xmath13 < -r$ ] , then @xmath16 < 0 $ ] whenever @xmath57 $ ] .    for width 9 , for instance , we have @xmath58=4 $ ] , @xmath59=\\frac32 \\,|\\ , 0 \\,\\|\\ , { -\\frac12 } \\,|\\ , { -\\frac52}$ ] , @xmath60=5 \\,|\\ , 3 \\,\\|\\ , \\frac{11}{4 } \\,|\\ , \\frac14 $ ] , and @xmath25 \\le [ 2]+[2 ] = 1 \\,|\\ , { -\\frac12 } \\,\\|\\ , { -1 } \\,|\\ , { -\\frac52 } < { -\\frac12}$ ] . by summing these , it is easy to show that @xmath61=h \\mbox { for all } n \\ge 22.\\ ] ] similarly , for width 11 we have @xmath58=5 $ ] and @xmath59=1 \\,|\\ , \\left\\ { \\frac12 \\,|\\ , { -1 } \\,\\|\\ , { -\\frac32 } \\,|\\ , { -\\frac72 } \\right\\}$ ] . then @xmath51 \\le [ 2]+[2]+[2]+[2 ] = 1 \\,|\\ , { -\\frac12 } \\,\\|\\ , { -1 } \\,|\\ , { -\\frac52 } < { -\\frac12}$ ] and @xmath62 \\le [ 8]+[8 ] \\le { -\\frac32}$ ] , so @xmath63=h \\mbox { for all } n \\ge 56.\\ ] ] unfortunately , for all other widths greater than 7 , either [ 2 ] or @xmath59+[2]$ ] is positive and @xmath60 $ ] is as well , so without some way to calculate values for @xmath25 $ ] or more we ca nt establish this kind of bound . nor",
    "do we know of any length for which hepzibah wins on width 8 , or a proof that she wins any board of width 6 by a positive amount .    to get results on boards of other widths , we can use a variety of tricks .",
    "first of all , just as hepzibah can choose to cross a vertical boundary between games , vera can choose not to cross a horizontal one .",
    "thus equation  [ eqn2 ] is one of a dual pair , @xmath64 & \\le & [ m \\times n_1 ] + [ m \\times n_2 ] \\\\   { } [ ( m_1+m_2 ) \\times n ] & \\ge & [ m_1 \\times n ] + [ m_2 \\times n]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] another useful rule is that @xmath65={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] or @xmath9 , since neither player can have an advantage on a square board .",
    "in fact , in game - theoretic terms @xmath65+[n \\times n]=0 $ ] , so if hepzibah goes second she can win by mimicking vera s move , rotated @xmath66 , in the other board .",

    "@xcite ) we also have @xmath68={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] or @xmath7",
    ". therefore @xmath68=h$ ] and @xmath71=h \\mbox { for all } k \\ge 1.\\ ] ] we can also use our addition rules backward ; since no two games can sum to a square in a way that gives an advantage to either player , @xmath72={{\\rm 2nd}}$ or $ v$ , then $ [ ( n - m ) \\times",
    "n ] \\ne v$}\\ ] ] and similarly for the dual version .    using the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite , some computer searches of our own , and a program that propagates these rules as much as possible gives the table shown in figure  [ bigtab ]",
    ". it would be very nice to deduce who wins on some large squares ; the @xmath73 square is the largest known so far ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we note that if @xmath74={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] then @xmath75={{\\rm 1st}}$ ] since @xmath76=v$ ] .",
    "on a torus , hepzibah can choose not to play across a vertical boundary and vera can choose not to play across a horizontal one . thus cutting a torus , or pasting a rectangle along one pair of edges , to make a horizontal or vertical cylinder gives the inequalities shown in figure  [ torusfig ] .",
    "note that there is no obvious relation between the value of a rectangle and that of a torus of the same size .    while it is easy to find who wins on tori and cylinders of various small widths ,",
    "we do the analysis here only for tori of width 2 .",
    "since vera s move takes both squares in the same column , these boards are equivalent to horizontal cylinders like those shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ torusfig ] ( or , for that matter , mbius strips or klein bottles ) .",
    "therefore , if hepzibah can win on the rectangle of length @xmath11 , she can win here as well .",
    "the second player has slightly more power here than she did in on the rectangle , since the first player has no control over the effect of her move .",
    "if vera goes first , she simply converts a torus of length @xmath11 into a rectangle of length @xmath77 , and if hepzibah goes first , vera can choose where to put the rectangle s vertical boundary , in essence choosing hepzibah s first move for her .",
    "on the other hand , in the latter case hepzibah gets to play again , and can treat the remainder of the game as the sum of two rectangles and a horizontal space .",
    "these observations give the following table for tori of width 2 : @xmath78_{\\rm rect } & [ n-1]_{\\rm rect } & [ n]_{\\rm torus } \\\\",
    "\\hline h & & h \\\\ { { \\rm 1st } } & { { \\rm 1st}}\\mbox { or } h & h \\\\ { { \\rm 1st } } & { { \\rm 2nd}}\\mbox { or } v & { { \\rm 1st}}\\\\ { { \\rm 2nd}}\\mbox { or } v & { { \\rm 1st}}\\mbox { or } h & { { \\rm 2nd}}\\mbox { or } h   \\end{array}\\ ] ] these and our table for @xmath10 rectangles determine @xmath13_{\\rm torus}$ ] for all @xmath11 except 5 , 9 , and 13 .",
    "vera loses all of these if she plays first , since she reduces the board to a rectangle which is a win for hepzibah . for 5 and 9 ,",
    "vera wins if hepzibah plays first by playing in such a way that hepzibah s domino is in the center of the resulting rectangle , creating a position which has zero value .",
    "thus these boards are wins for the @xmath9 player . for 13 , hepzibah wins since ( as the toolkit tells us ) all of vera s replies to hepzibah leave us in a negative position .",
    "our computer searches show that @xmath79 tori are wins for the @xmath9 player when @xmath80 , @xmath81 , or @xmath82 , and for the @xmath8 player when @xmath83 , @xmath84 , or @xmath85 .",
    "we conjecture that this alternation continues , and that square tori of odd and even size are wins for the @xmath9 and @xmath8 players respectively .",
    "we note that a similar argument can be used to show that 9 is prime .",
    "while correctly playing the sum of many games is pspace - complete in general @xcite , the kinds of sums we have considered here are especially easy to play .",
    "for instance , if @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] are both wins for hepzibah , she can win on @xmath20 $ ] by playing wherever she likes if she goes first , and replying to vera in whichever game vera chooses thereafter .",
    "thus if we have strategies for both these games , we have a strategy for their sum .",
    "all our additive rules are of this kind .",
    "above , we showed for a number of widths that boards of any length can be reduced to sums of a finite number of lengths .",
    "since each of these can be won with some finite strategy , and since sums of them can be played in a simple way , we have proved the following theorem :      note that we are not asking that the strategy produce optimum play , in which hepzibah ( or on small boards , @xmath8 , @xmath9 or vera ) wins by as many moves as possible , but only that it tells her how to win .",
    "in fact , we conjecture that this theorem is true for boards of any width",
    ". this would follow if for any @xmath15 there exists an @xmath11 such that hepzibah wins by some positive number of moves , which in turn implies that there is some @xmath86 such that she wins on all boards longer than @xmath86 .",
    "a similar conjecture is made in @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this is not the same as saying that there is a single polynomial - time strategy for playing on boards of any size .",
    "the size or running time of the strategy could grow exponentially in @xmath15 , even if it grows polynomially when @xmath15 is held constant",
