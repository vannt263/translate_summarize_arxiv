    "many soft materials consist of building blocks that are themselves `` soft '' , meaning that , under experimental conditions , they can interpenetrate or deform appreciably due to the forces acting between them .",
    "linear polymers provide an example :  @xcite at moderate free - energy cost , the centers of mass of two distinct polymers can be made to superimpose . these macromolecules are therefore fully interpenetrable .",
    "other particles do not interpenetrate but are deformable , like polymer micelles : they deform elastically at high densities , thus exploring configurations that are forbidden to hard - particle systems .",
    "systems of soft particles are interesting because crystallization in simple and colloidal systems is usually attributed to excluded - volume effects .",
    "systems with soft - repulsive , short - range interactions are therefore expected to have a qualitatively different freezing behavior than those with hard particles .",
    "@xcite indeed , one of the striking features of systems of particles with a bounded repulsive interaction is that they have a maximum melting temperature . above it ,",
    "the solid phase is unstable .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood as follows : consider a system with an interparticle potential that has its maximum energy @xmath0 at zero separation and decreases monotonically to zero within a distance @xmath1 . when the thermal energy @xmath2 , interparticle interactions become negligible and the system approaches ideal gas behavior . however , when @xmath3 particles can only overlap at a significant energetic cost . in the limit @xmath4 , the system will undergo a hard - sphere freezing transition .",
    "in fact , some 30 years ago , stillinger already showed that the so - called gaussian core model ( gcm ) has a maximum melting point .",
    "@xcite moreover , stillinger , and subsequently other authors ,  @xcite showed that the gcm also exhibits re - entrant melting upon compression , and a transition from face- to body - centered cubic crystal structures .",
    "such a rich phase behavior is not limited to the repulsive gaussian potential , but has been shown to be common to many effective , soft potentials that were designed to reproduce the phase behavior and dynamics of microgels ,  @xcite star - polyelectrolyte solutions  @xcite and star - polymer solutions .",
    "@xcite    however , not all soft - repulsive potentials give rise to re - entrant melting . the penetrable sphere model ( psm ) ,",
    "@xcite a square - shoulder potential , is the simplest model that leads to freezing at any arbitrary temperature and to the appearance of cluster crystals ( multiple occupation of lattice sites ) .",
    "multiple occupancy in the psm arises because , as soon as two particles interpenetrate , no further energetic cost exists for full overlapping . as a consequence , particles can sit on top of each other thus reducing the total number of overlaps and the interaction energy .",
    "density functional theory and molecular simulations have confirmed the occurrence of cluster crystals for the generalized exponential model .  @xcite it is expected that certain dendrimers could form such crystals ,  @xcite but thus far experiments are lacking ( see , however , ref .  ) .",
    "it is apparent from the discussion above that the shape of the pair potential determines when the re - entrant melting and clustering scenarios manifest in the phase diagram .",
    "indeed , likos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite established a simple criterion to distinguish between the two scenarios for bounded repulsive potentials : re - entrant melting happens for bounded potentials with a positive definite fourier transform .",
    "otherwise , clustering and freezing are expected to occur at all temperatures .",
    "although the type of scenario , either re - entrant melting or clustering , can be predicted , there is no method that guarantees an _ a priori _ prediction of all stable crystal structures given the bounded repulsive potential .",
    "the usual method involves selecting a small number of candidate structures , for which the ground - state energy or finite - temperature free energies are computed . among the candidates ,",
    "the stable structure at any particular density and temperature is the one with the lowest ( free ) energy .",
    "this works well for typical pair potentials , for which one assumes that unusual crystals are unlikely to be stable structures .",
    "however , soft potentials are known to induce multiple crystals ,  @xcite including the less typical non - cubic lattices , and exotic structures like the a15 and diamond  @xcite ( for an extreme example , see ref .  ) .",
    "there exist powerful approaches to search for stable crystal structures , such as those based on metadynamics  @xcite and genetic algorithms .",
    "@xcite however , metadynamics can be very expensive , in particular when trying to escape deep , local free - energy minima . in a genetic algorithm , an initially random population of lattices",
    "is modified using evolutionary rules according to a fitness function : high fitness corresponds to low ( free ) energy .",
    "the structure with the highest fitness in the population after breeding a few generations is assumed to be the most stable lattice .",
    "although genetic algorithms greatly alleviate the problem of searching for candidate crystal structures , they still suffer from the same numerical bottleneck of the usual method : the expensive computation of free energies .",
    "for this reason , numerical searches for stable crystal structures are often based on energies , rather than free energies . to improve upon this approach",
    ", one can approximate the free energy by that of a harmonic crystal or by using density - functional theory",
    ". however , to improve accuracy , one has to turn to computer simulation methods that generate free energies that are `` exact '' to within statistical accuracy .",
    "accurate free - energy calculations can be crucial in soft systems where , specially at high densities , crystals with very similar energies can compete for stability .",
    "in this paper we focus on the phase behavior of hertzian spheres .",
    "the hertz potential describes the change in elastic energy of two deformable objects when subjected to an axial compression .",
    "@xcite the potential has the following form : @xmath5 where @xmath1 and @xmath0 set the length and energy scales and @xmath6 is the distance between the centers of the undeformed spheres . in the limit @xmath7",
    "the hard - sphere model is recovered .",
    "the hertz model was developed to describe the interaction between elastic spheres that are deformed only slightly .",
    "clearly , for very large compressions or at high densities ( well above the overlap concentration ) the assumptions underlying the original hertz model no longer apply . here",
    "we use the hertz potential as a simple representation of soft particles that is bounded ( i.e. it remains finite at @xmath8 ) , has a finite range ( viz .",
    "@xmath1 ) and a positive , yet sharply decaying fourier transform . also , the hertz potential is computationally cheap and thus allows us to perform extensive simulations for the calculation of free energies and coexistence points .",
    "we have not attempted to map the present model onto a specific soft - colloid or star - polymer system .",
    "@xcite we just note that a judicious design of star polymers or dendrimers  @xcite makes it possible to `` engineer '' the interaction between these particles to a considerable degree .    using standard thermodynamic integration , we calculated free energies of the fluid phase and of candidate crystal structures . as candidates , we considered all bravais lattices and the hexagonal close - packed , diamond , and a15 structures .",
    "our results show that the phase diagram of the hertz model exhibits multiple re - entrant melting and polymorphic transitions between a number of crystals .",
    "in addition , we find that the re - entrant fluid shows unusual diffusivity curves , and speculate about the nature of this fluid at high density and low temperature .    the general primitive cell and vectors @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11.,height=207 ]    l c c c c c c bravais lattice    ' '' ''    & @xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 + simple cubic ( sc )    ' '' ''    & 1 & 1 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1 + face - centered cubic ( fcc ) & @xmath18 & @xmath18 & 1/3 & 1/4 & 1/4 & 1/4 + body - centered cubic ( bcc ) & 1 & @xmath19 & 0.304 & 0.304 & 1/2 & 1/2 + hexagonal ( h ) & 1 & ( 1/2 ) & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1/3 & [ @xmath20 + simple tetragonal ( st ) & 1 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1/2 + body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) & 1 & ( 3/4 ) & [ 0.268 ] & [ 0.268 ] & 1/2 & [ 1/4 ] + rhombohedral or trigonal ( r ) & 1 & 1 & ( 1/3 ) & [ 1/3 ] & [ 1/3 ] & [ @xmath18 ] + simple orthorhombic ( so ) & ( @xmath18 ) & ( @xmath19 ) & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1/2 & [ 0.612 ] + base - centered orthorhombic ( baco ) & ( 1 ) & ( @xmath18 ) & 1/2 & 1/2 & [ 1/4 ] & [ 1/2 ] + body - centered orthorhombic ( bco ) & ( @xmath18 ) & ( 4/5 ) & [ 0.285 ] & [ 0.285 ] & 1/2 & [ 0.265 ] + face - centered orthorhombic ( fco ) & ( 3/5 ) & ( @xmath19 ) & [ 0.340 ] & [ 0.304 ] & [ 0.186 ] & [ 0.235 ] + simple monoclinic ( sm ) & ( @xmath18 ) & ( @xmath19 ) & ( 1/3 ) & 1/2 & 1/2 & [ 0.530 ] + base - centered monoclinic ( bacm ) & 1 & ( @xmath18 ) & ( 1/3 ) & 1/3 & ( 1/4 ) & [ 0.420 ] + triclinic ( t ) & ( @xmath18 ) & ( @xmath19 ) & ( 1/3 ) & ( 0.4 ) & ( 2/3 ) & [ 0.306 ] +    l c c c non - bravais lattice    ' '' ''    & reference bravais lattice & @xmath22 & @xmath23 + diamond ( d )    ' '' ''    & fcc & 1 & @xmath24 + hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) & simple hexagonal ( sh ) ( h with @xmath25 ) & 1 & @xmath26 + a15 & sc & 7 & @xmath27 + &    ' '' ''    & & @xmath28 +",

    "but at @xmath129 a transition between the a5 and the bct happens to be close to that same density  @xcite ( the a5 becomes unstable at @xmath130 ) , which makes an extremum occurring at the same location in the phase diagram unlikely .",
    "the fact that there is such a strong correlation between the shape of the computed phase diagram and the dynamics of the fluid provides indirect support for the assumption that we have indeed identified the stable crystal phases at @xmath127 .    in the next paragraphs we discuss a few interesting aspects of the fluid phase .",
    "the re - entrance of the fluid at high densities and low temperatures ( e.g. at @xmath131 and @xmath132 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ) appears to be different in nature from that of a hard - sphere fluid , which has a rugged potential - energy landscape and yet is a fluid because there is an extended and connected region in configuration space where the potential energy is strictly zero ( and therefore flat ) . for the hertz model at the aforementioned density ,",
    "the typical inter - particle distance in the liquid phase is of the order of 0.5@xmath1 and the potential is at less than 20% of its maximum value ; also , at the aforementioned temperature , the relative radial displacement of two particles by as little as @xmath133 will change the potential energy of such a pair by an amount that is comparable to @xmath134 . hence , the potential - energy landscape is far from being flat at these conditions .",
    "we suggest that the reason why hertzian spheres ( and other potentials showing re - entrant melting , like the gcm ) melt at high densities and low temperatures has to do with the fact that the fourier transform of the potential goes to zero rapidly .",
    "indeed , st  @xcite ( see also ref .  ) has shown rigorously that integrable bounded potentials whose fourier transform is non - negative and vanishes above a wave number @xmath135 have an infinite number of continuously degenerate ground states above a well - defined threshold density .",
    "this means that , for this class of pair potentials , the potential energy is completely flat along certain directions in configuration space .",
    "although the hertz potential does not satisfy the st criteria ( its fourier transform does not vanish above any @xmath135 ) , its fourier transform does decay @xmath136 for wave vectors larger than @xmath137 ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "we speculate that , as a result , certain collective motions in the dense phase cost very little potential energy .",
    "it is the softness of the pair potential that causes melting into a rather peculiar liquid for which particle motions should be strongly correlated .",
    "diffusion coefficient of the fluid phase obtained by molecular dynamics as a function of density at three temperature values .",
    "breaks in the lines joining the simulation data indicate that points in between were identified as crystalline states .",
    "the inset shows the radial distribution function @xmath138 for the isotherm at @xmath139 and the following values of @xmath101 : 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 .",
    "the highest peak in each @xmath138 is marked with a black dot . in the set of black dots ,",
    "the local maximum and minimum occur approximately at the densities at which the diffusion coefficient has a minimum ( @xmath101=2.40 ) and a maximum ( @xmath101=6.35 ) , respectively . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusivity ] we show other aspects of the peculiarity of the dynamics of the fluid phase .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath140 , which decreases monotonically with increasing density in simple liquids , shows a clear non - monotonic behavior in the hertzian fluid .",
    "moreover , the minimum in @xmath140 at @xmath141 coincides with the maximum freezing point at @xmath121 , and a maximum in the first peak of the @xmath138 ( see inset in fig .  [ fig : diffusivity ] ) . also the maxima in @xmath140 for the three temperatures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusivity ] are located at the same density as the maximum freezing point at @xmath124 and a minimum in the first peak of @xmath138 .",
    "these multiple structural and dynamical anomalies , and their interrelation , has been seen before in bounded potentials ,  @xcite in liquids with water - like anomalies  @xcite and colloids with short - ranged attractions .",
    "@xcite this suggests that crystallization and fluid dynamics are inextricably connected , and that this connection is not independent of the underlying crystal structure .",
    "for instance , the presence of the h and sc crystals does not imprint peaks in the diffusion coefficient as the bct does .",
    "we think that this is related to the fact that single - particle mobility is affected by differences in packing efficiency : the intrinsic volume of the bct primitive cell is much smaller than that of the bcc , h and sc structures .",
    "besides , even though particle motions in the low - temperature liquid phase are strongly correlated , the liquid does not appear to be particularly glassy .",
    "in fact , within the range of densities studied , we observe spontaneous crystallization rather than structural arrest upon cooling even at temperatures below @xmath142 .",
    "further study of the dynamics of the high - density , supercooled liquid would therefore be most interesting .",
    "another interesting feature of the system at high densities and low temperatures is its freezing behavior .",
    "we have used free - energy calculations to trace freezing curves up to a density of @xmath143 . even beyond that density",
    ", there appears to be a succession of other freezing transitions .",
    "although we have not traced the accurate phase boundaries completely for @xmath144 , we have calculated free energies at @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and found the stable structure to be the bct with @xmath147 . additionally , we have found that crystallization occurs at low temperatures and at densities up to @xmath148 . in other words : as far as we can tell , the low - temperature phase is always crystalline , but the structure of the stable crystalline phase changes as the density is increased .",
    "there is also evidence  @xcite at @xmath129 supporting this observation .",
    "in fact , the ground - state behavior is interesting in the context of a result reported by torquato and stillinger :  @xcite on the basis of duality relations between a soft potential and its fourier transform , these authors found a one - dimensional system , the overlap potential , that exhibits an infinite number of phase transitions between periodic ground states over the entire density range .",
    "one can then wonder whether the hertz potential also shows an unbounded number of phase transitions between periodic structures .",
    "interestingly , the hertz potential and the overlap potential in 1d and 3d , @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath151 , studied in ref .  , belong to the same class of non - negative , bounded functions , and both have oscillatory , decaying fourier transforms ( see ref .   and inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ) .    in summary , we have shown that the hertz potential gives rise to a phase diagram with multiple re - entrant melting transitions and a succession of bravais crystals spanning a wide range of densities .",
    "in addition , the diffusion coefficient of the re - entrant fluid shows unusual non - monotonic curves with increasing density .",
    "this rich behavior together with the simplicity of the potential s functional form makes the hertz model an attractive one for the study of kinetic phenomena in soft - core systems , like martensitic transformations and supercooled dynamics .",
