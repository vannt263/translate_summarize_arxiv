    "minimal surfaces are most commonly known as surfaces which have the minimum area amongst all other surfaces spanning a given closed curve in @xmath2 .",
    "geometrically , the definition of a minimal surface is that the mean curvature @xmath3 at every point of the surface . if locally one can write the minimal surface in @xmath4 as @xmath5 the minimal surface equation @xmath3 is equivalent to @xmath6 there exists a choice of conformal coordinates @xmath7 so that the surface @xmath8 satisfying the minimal surface equation is given as follows  @xcite : @xmath9    the general solution of such an equation is called the local weierstrass  enneper representation .",
    "let @xmath10 be a simply connected domain in @xmath11 @xmath12 an analytic function and @xmath13 a meromorphic function on @xmath10 .",
    "then , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a conformal immersion of @xmath10 into @xmath2 which is minimal  @xcite .",
    "the immersion is regular provided that wherever @xmath13 has a pole of order @xmath16 , @xmath12 has a zero of at least order @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 is the stereographic projection of the gauss map .",
    "there is a simpler representation , valid away from the umbilical points of the surface .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the gaussian curvature of the surface is @xmath20 vanishes , @xmath21 and @xmath22 has no pole .",
    "thus in the neighborhood of a nonumbilic interior point , any minimal surface can be represented in terms of @xmath23 as follows  @xcite : @xmath24\\label{e3b } y(\\zeta ) & = y_0 + \\re \\int_{\\zeta_0}^{\\zeta } i ( 1 + w^2 ) r(w ) \\,\\d w,\\\\\\label{e3c } \\phi(\\zeta ) & = \\phi_0 + \\re \\int_{\\zeta_0}^{\\zeta } 2 w r(w ) \\,\\d w.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this semi - expository paper we show that a system of hodographic coordinates gives us the local weierstrass  enneper representation of a minimal surface .",
    "our method provides an easy way of calculating conformal coordinates if the formula for the graph of the minimal surface is given , locally .",
    "this is not given in the standard text books .",
    "hodographic coordinates are a natural concept in fluid mechanics where velocity fields play the role of independent variables .",
    "it was mentioned in the context of minimal surfaces first in @xcite and was used in the context of born  infeld equations in @xcite . if one replaces @xmath25 by @xmath26 in the born ",
    "infeld equations , one obtains the minimal surface equation .",
    "thus it is natural to expect a general solution for the minimal surface by following whitham s method @xcite for the born  infeld equation .",
    "finally we derive the hodographic coordinates @xmath27 , complex conjugates of each other , which enables us to write the weierstrass representation in a new way .",
    "in the height representation of the minimal surface , or monge gauge , one writes the minimal surface equation in @xmath2 as in ( 1 ) .    introducing the complex coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we define @xmath30 and @xmath31 to reduce the second - order differential equation ( 1 ) to a pair of first - order equations : @xmath32 the hodograph transformation interchanges the dependent and independent variables @xmath33 .",
    "to do this we use @xmath34 \\bz_u & \\bz_v\\end{matrix}\\right ] \\left[\\begin{matrix } u_z & u_{\\bz}\\\\[.3pc ] v_z & v_{\\bz}\\end{matrix}\\right]= \\left [ \\begin{matrix } 1&0\\\\[.3pc ] 0&1\\end{matrix}\\right]\\ ] ] and find @xmath35 note that we have transformed the nonlinear partial differential equations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 into linear partial differential equations for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , it should come as no surprise that the minimal surface equation has a linear representation .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce the new variables @xmath40 , @xmath41 to facilitate our solution .",
    "the inverse of this transformation is @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43    in these new coordinates the eqs @xmath44 and @xmath45 are greatly simplified : @xmath46    using the inverse transformation @xmath47 its complex conjugate , and the equalities @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we obtain @xmath50    using the expression for @xmath36 and @xmath37 in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath52 we rewrite ( 9 ) as @xmath53    substracting ( 12 ) from ( 11 ) and using ( 8) we get zero .",
    "thus eqs  ( [ ena ] ) and ( [ enb ] ) are equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ ee1 ] ) .    now taking derivative of eq .",
    "( [ ee1 ] ) with respect to @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath54    using ( 13 ) and its complex conjugate we immediately obtain @xmath55 from which it follows that @xmath56 using ( 10 ) we find @xmath57 so @xmath58 moreover , we have @xmath59 so that @xmath60 it is straightforward to check that the coordinates @xmath61 and @xmath62 are isothermal so that @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    rewriting ( [ e5a ] ) for @xmath65 and @xmath25",
    ", we have @xmath66    letting @xmath67 , eqs  ( [ e3a])([e3c ] ) are the weierstrass  enneper representation away from the umbilical points of the surface @xcite . at an umbilical point , the gaussian curvature @xmath68 vanishes so @xmath69 , precisely where ( [ invert ] ) has no solution .",
    "if @xmath70 , we can locally introduce new variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "locally the inverse exists when the gaussian curvature is finite .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath73 .",
    "if inverse exists , @xmath74 can be written as    @xmath75 y & = \\frac{\\sigma - \\rho}{2i } - \\frac{1}{2i } \\int_{\\rho_0}^{\\rho } ( f^{-1}(\\tilde{\\rho}))^2 \\d \\tilde{\\rho } + \\frac{1}{2i } \\int_{\\sigma_0}^{\\sigma}(g^{-1}(\\tilde{\\sigma}))^2 \\d \\tilde{\\sigma},\\\\[.6pc ] \\phi & = \\int_{\\rho_0}^{\\rho } f^{-1 } ( \\tilde{\\rho } ) \\d \\tilde{\\rho } + \\int_{\\sigma_0}^{\\sigma } g^{-1}(\\tilde{\\sigma } ) \\d \\tilde{\\sigma},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "if @xmath79 , then it can be shown that @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus @xmath82 , @xmath83 are the isothermal coordinates .",
    "the @xmath51 system and the @xmath84 system are related by a conformal map , @xmath85 and its inverse .",
    "the geometric meaning of @xmath86 is as follows : the unit normal to the surface in the @xmath84 system is given by @xmath87 an example ----------    we consider the helicoid , @xmath88 .",
    "we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 so that    @xmath91,\\\\ z&=\\frac{-i}{2v } = \\frac{-i}{2}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\eta}-\\zeta\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath92 , from which it follows that the hodographic coordinates are @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
