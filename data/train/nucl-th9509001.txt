    "because of the easy transferability of sufficient energy in the intermediate energy nuclear collisions to the nucleus , and the reduced effect of the pauli blocking , the quasi - free scattering forms a major portion of the reactive content in nuclear cross - sections at these energies . in experiments ,",
    "this fact is manifested by a broad bump in the ejectile energy spectrum around @xmath5 , where ( @xmath6 ) is the four momentum transfer to the nucleus ( @xmath7 being the effective mass of the nucleon ) .",
    "the width of this bump is correlated to the momentum spread of the nucleon in the nucleus . in earlier times , this aspect was exploited much to gather directly the information about the single particle aspect , in particular the shell model , of the nucleus through the study of the inclusive ( p , p@xmath8 ) , ( e , e@xmath8 ) reactions , and the exclusive ( p,2p ) , ( e , e@xmath8p ) [ 1 ] , and other reactions of similar type . in recent years , however , the focus on similar studies has shifted to the charge - exchange reactions , like ( p , n ) , ( @xmath1he , t ) in the quasi - free region [ 2,3 ] . this has happened because of the discovery of strong gamow - teller excitations in these reactions and a rather simple ( born term ) description of the spin - isospin piece of the n - n interaction in terms of a one- pion- and a rho - exchange interaction [ 4 ] .",
    "it is felt that the study of these reactions in the quasi - free region , like the earlier quasi - free knock - out studies , would provide an opportunity to explore the single particle spin - isospin response of the nucleus .",
    "this response , due to pi- and a rho - meson - exchange , contains longitudinal as well as the transverse components . going beyond the single particle aspect , one expects that these studies may also explore the particle - hole correlations in the quasi - free region .",
    "theorists predict [ 5 ] that the particle - hole correlations , apart from modifying the magnitudes , shift the longitudinal response towards the lower excitation energy and the transverse response towards the higher excitation energy .",
    "in addition , it is also known that these correlations also renormalize the propagation of pions in the nuclear medium .",
    "because of this , the study of the spin - isospin nuclear response to various external probes has been a topic of great interest over the past decade .",
    "an extensive experimental study of the ( @xmath1he , t ) reaction has been carried out at saturne [ 6 ] , and the ( p , n ) reaction at los alamos [ 2 ] . theoretically too , several efforts have been made to study these reactions .",
    "alberico et al .",
    "[ 7 ] have developed a random phase approximatiom theory ( rpa ) of the spin - isospin nuclear surface response and studied the contrast between the spin - longitudinal ( @xmath9 ) and spin - transverse ( @xmath10 ) part of the nuclear response .",
    "their predictions are for nuclear matter and use a @xmath11 model for the interaction .",
    "ichimura et al .",
    "[ 8 ] have improved upon this method and have calculated @xmath9 and @xmath10 by the continuum rpa with the orthogonality condition .",
    "they treat the nucleus as of finite size and present the cross - sections for @xmath12ca(p , p@xmath8 ) reaction at e@xmath13 = 500 mev using the distorted wave impulse approximation . however , notwithstanding these efforts , bertsch et al . [ 9 ] , while discussing a number of experiments in a recent critical review of this field , find that the effect of the residual particle - hole correlations seen in the experiments in the quasi - free region is much smaller than expected .",
    "considering the above observation of bertsch et al .",
    "[ 9 ] as an indication of the weakness of the correlations ( whatever may be the reason ) , in the present paper we study the quasi - elastic peak region as being populated by the charge - exchange knock - out of a neutron in the target nucleus .",
    "the motivation for this work is to explore the extent upto which the experimental data could be accounted by the independent particle framework alone .",
    "we have done the calculations in the dwia , where the interaction of the mass 3 particles in the continuum with the nucleus is incorporated through the use of distorted waves . as a typical case , we analyse the data on the @xmath0c(@xmath1he , t ) reaction at 2 gev beam energy [ 3 ] .",
    "specifically , we assume that the quasi - free region in this reaction is populated by the @xmath0c(@xmath1he , tp ) reaction , where the proton in the final state arises due to the charge exchange of a proton in @xmath1he with a neutron in 1s or 1p shell in @xmath0c . since the experimental data for the @xmath0c(@xmath1he , t ) reaction in the quasi - free region are of inclusive type , we do not include , in our calculations , the distortion potential for the proton in the final state . the main effect of distortion of the proton in the @xmath0c(@xmath1he , tp ) reaction is to remove the proton flux from this channel to other channels , which in the inclusive measurements is included in the data . furthermore , since , due to strong absorption of the projectile and ejectile , the charge - exchange between the @xmath1he and @xmath0c nucleons occurs in the low density surface region of the nucleus , we consider the elementary process , pn@xmath14np , in the nucleus as a quasi - free process . in the present case , of course , this process is off - shell .",
    "we construct the t - matrix for it following our earlier studies on the elementary processes , p(n , p)n and p(p,@xmath15)n [ 10 ] . in this work ,",
    "the t - matrix is constructed in the dwba , using one- pion plus rho - exchange potential for the @xmath16 .",
    "this t- matrix reproduces the experimental data on the p(n , p)n reaction . for the p(p,@xmath15)n reaction , incidentally , in the same work",
    "it was found that only one - pion - exchange results agree with the experiments .    in section 2",
    "we give the formalism for the ( @xmath1he , t ) reaction .",
    "the transition amplitude is written in a distorted wave impulse approximation , as mentioned above , and distortions of @xmath1he and triton are treated in the eikonal approximation .",
    "we also present briefly the procedure to calculate the elementary t - matrix , t@xmath17 .    in the charge - exchange reaction , besides t@xmath17 , the cross - section also receives contribution from the iso - spin term , t@xmath18 . since , in boson - exchange models , this t - matrix gets constructed from second- and higher - order born terms only",
    ", we have not constructed it here .",
    "we have used for it the phenomenologically determined t - matrix of franey and love [ 11 ] . in any case , as we shall see later , the contribution of t@xmath18 to the ( @xmath1he , t ) cross - section is not much .",
    "the experimental data for the @xmath0c(@xmath1he , t ) reaction , as obtained by bergqvist et al .",
    "[ 3 ] , exist for the triton energy spectrum at @xmath3 to @xmath4 emission angles at 2 gev beam energy .",
    "these spectra are inclusive .",
    "the broad structure seen in them between 1.9 and 2 gev triton energy can be ascribed to the quasi - free charge - exchange reaction .",
    "the theoretical cross - sections corresponding to these spectra are obtained by first calculating the double differential cross - section @xmath19 , and then integrating it over the allowed kinematics of the outgoing protons and summing over the various neutron states in the target nucleus . in section 3",
    "we present the calculated differential cross - sections .",
    "the calculations are done with and without the @xmath20-exchange contribution in the interaction , and compared with the experimentally measured spectra .",
    "we find a reasonable overall agreement between the calculated and measured cross - sections with pi- plus rho - exchange interaction .",

    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are the distorted waves for helium and triton respectively . for protons , because of the inclusive nature of the reaction , we use plane waves .",
    "this is appropriate , because , as discussed in the literature [ 12 ] , the main effect of the distortion at intermediate energies is absorptive .",
    "this results in the transfer of flux from the given channel to other channels . in an inclusive reaction",
    ", these channels are included in the measured cross - sections .",

    "the dispersive effects are small .",
    "therefore , in evaluating the elementary t - matrix , @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) , we approximate the momentum transfer , @xmath46 , by that corresponding to the asymptotic momenta of @xmath1he and triton .",

    "including the effect of elastic and other channels on @xmath72 transition in nucleon - nucleon scattering , at intermediate energies we write @xmath73 where @xmath74 s are the distorted waves for the pn relative motion .",
    "they are the solutions of potentials which describe the pn elastic scattering . below the pion threshold , these potentials are available from boson- exchange models . however , in the energy region , which is of relevance in the present work and is above the pion threshold , these potentials need major modifications . in the absence of a reliable estimate of such modifications , we have used the eikonal approximation ( which is valid at higher energies ) and have written @xmath75 s directly in terms of the elementary elastic scattering amplitude , f(k , q ) , as ( for details see ref.[13 ] ) ,    @xmath76.\\ ] ]    here the amplitude f(k , q ) peaks at zero degree and falls off rapidly .",

    "these values are consistent with several experimental observations , like , @xmath91n scattering , nn scattering [ 17 ] , electro - disintegration of the deuteron [ 18 ] , deuteron properties [ 19 ] and dispersive theoretical approaches [ 20 ] . in the value of @xmath115 , of course , there is some uncertainty .",

    ", we use the phenomenologically determined t - matrix of franey and love [ 11 ] from nn scattering experiments at 725 mev beam energy .",
    "the contribution of this term to the cross - section , however , as we shall see later , is not much .",
    "the distorted waves for helium and triton appear as a product in eqs .",
    "( 10,11 ) . in the eikonal approximation , this can be approximated as follows , @xmath119 if we ignore the difference between the phase shifts of @xmath1he and triton ( around 2 gev ) . here",
    "@xmath120 corresponds to the phase shift of a mass 3 particle .",
    "the phase shift function @xmath120 can be constructed , in principle , from optical potentials .",
    "but , since this is a poorly known quantity , we refer to the experimentally measured values .",
    "the experimental @xmath120 too is not available for mass 3 particles and hence we use the phase shifts obtained from alpha scattering at 1.37 gev on calcium isotopes [ 25 ] .",

    "the radius parameter @xmath123 , and diffuseness , a , of this functional form are found equal to 1.45 and 0.68 fm . respectively .",
    "we use this phase shift function for our purpose too , except that the radius , r , is put corresponding to a=12 .",
    "before we present the calculated cross - sections , in fig .",
    "2 we show at 2 gev beam energy the range of momentum transfer ( q ) involved in the triton emission upto 7@xmath124 in lab . in the quasi - elastic range of the triton energy ( i.e. upto 1900 mev ) , this momentum transfer , as we see , is not small . at 2 - 3",
    "degree it is around 250 mev / c , and at larger angles it goes to about 500 mev / c .",
    "this suggests that the non - central component of the t - matrix , t@xmath50 , and hence the @xmath125-exchange part of the @xmath86 ( whose contribution increases at larger q ) , may effect the quasi - elastic cross - section significantly .",
    "however , because the rho - exchange contributes with opposite signs to the central and non - central pieces of the potential ( see eqs .",
    "23 , 24 ) , it is not immediately obvious as how much , in net , the rho - exchange would change the cross - sections . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the typical central and non - central components of the real part of the calculated elementary t - matrix used in our calculations .",
    "we show this t - matrix for a pure one - pion - exchange potential and for a one pion- plus rho - exchange potential . as expected , we see that the rho - exchange affects both the pieces of the t - matrix significantly , but in the opposite directions .    to demonstrate the extent to which the above t - matrix reproduces the measured p(n , p)n cross - sections , in fig .",
    "4 we show the calculated 0@xmath124 cross - sections alongwith the experimental data [ 26 - 33 ] over a large energy range . as we see , the calculated cross - sections are in good accord with the measured cross - sections .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the results for the @xmath0c(@xmath1he , t ) reaction together at all the angles of the triton emission . in fig .",
    "5a we see a representation of the experimentally measured cross - sections and in fig . 5b that of our corresponding theoretically calculated results .",
    "the calculated cross - sections are obtained with the pion and rho meson both included , and with contributions from the spin - flip and non - spin - flip channels to the transition matrix . as can be seen from the figs .",
    ", the overall behaviour of the experimental cross - sections , which includes the magnitude and position of the peak and its shift with the emission angle of the triton , gets reproduced reasonably well by the theoretical calculations .",
    "this vindicates , in essence , the applicability of the quasi - free mechanism framework presented in the earlier section to the region of the triton spectrum lying between the bound nuclear states and the delta production region .    in the following ,",
    "we give the results at each angle separately .    in figs .",
    "6 , 7 and 8 we show the triton energy spectra plotted individually for six triton emission angles between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the solid curves represent the calculations with the one - pion plus one - rho exchange interaction .",
    "the experimental results are represented by the dots . except at @xmath126 and @xmath4",
    ", we find a good accord between the calculated and measured cross- sections .",
    "the underestimation of the cross - sections at @xmath4 should not be a source of much discouragement , as the magnitude of the cross - section is too small at this angle ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "therefore , the measured cross - section can have large uncertainty and a significant contribution from other reaction mechanisms .",
    "the reason for the overestimation of the cross - section by about a factor of 3/2 at 5@xmath124 is , of course , not clear to us .    to isolate the contribution due to rho - exchange to the calculated cross - sections , in figs .",
    "6 - 8 we also display , by dashed curves , the cross - sections with only the one - pion - exchange transition potential . as we see from these figs . , the contribution of the rho - exchange changes continuously from being positive at @xmath3 to negative at @xmath4 .",
    "around 3@xmath124 it crosses the zero level .",
    "this happens , as mentioned earlier , due to change in the momentum transfer , q , ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and the opposite signs of the rho - exchange potential in the central and the non - central pieces of the potential . at smaller momenta ,",
    "where the central term dominates , the rho - exchange comes with the positive sign , while at larger angles , where the non - central term is important , it comes with the negative sign ( see eqs . 23 , 24 and fig .",
    "3 ) .    in our calculations",
    ", we also find that the calculated cross - sections are mainly decided by the spin - isospin dependent part of the t - matrix .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "9 , where we show the 2@xmath124 calculated cross - sections with and without the isospin - dependent term , @xmath128 .",
    "the dashed curve represents the calculation without the isospin - dependent term in the t - matrix , while the solid curve is the complete calculation .",
    "as we see , the only isospin - dependent term makes a contribution of less than @xmath129 to the cross - section .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the only uncertain parameter in the above calculations had been the value of the parameter @xmath80 - the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the elementary scattering amplitude . in fig .",
    "10 we show the calculated triton energy spectrum at 2@xmath124 and 6@xmath124 for three values of @xmath80 , viz .",
    "0.05 , -0.45 and -0.7 .",
    "these values lie within the uncertainty of the experimentally extracted value . as we see , the calculated cross - sections do depend upon the value of @xmath80 . for the present range , it can change the peak cross - section by a factor of 2 .    the quasi - free cross - sections , as we see from the examination of the expression ( eqs .",
    "6,7 ) for @xmath54 , is essentially determined by , ( i ) the t - matrix , t@xmath130 , and ( ii ) the neutron momentum distribution in the target nucleus through the recoil momentum distribution factors , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the t@xmath130 depends upon q , and f s on q. in fig .",
    "2 we see that the magnitude of q , at a particular triton emission angle , does not vary much in the region of the quasi - elastic peak .",
    "this means that the elementary t - matrix , t@xmath130 , too does not change much over this region for a fixed triton emission angle .",
    "consequently , in the a(@xmath1he , t)b reaction , the elementary t - matrix mainly affects the magnitude of the cross - sections ( see e.g. fig .",
    "the shapes of the triton energy spectra , which in the inclusive data mean the peak position and the width , are decided by the the recoil momentum distribution factors .",
    "since in the inclusive data the proton in the final state is not detected , and @xmath133 , each point in the triton energy spectrum involves an integral over a certain range of q. this means that even the shape of the triton energy spectra might not depend upon the details of the neutron momentum distribution in the nucleus",
    ". it may be sufficient if the neutron wave functions have correct separation energies for different shells and reproduce some gross properties , like the r.m.s .",
    "radius , of the nucleus . to exhibit this , in fig .",
    "11 we show the calculated cross - sections for two radial wave functions , @xmath100 , of the neutron in the target nucleus .",
    "the solid curve is the calculation with @xmath100 generated in a woods - saxon potential as has been used through out this work ; the dashed curve is the calculation using harmonic oscillator wave function with the oscillator parameter b=1.66 fm , which is consistent with the electron scattering data .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , within about @xmath129 , the two results are same .",
    "we have examined the quasi - elastic peak region in the @xmath0c(@xmath1he , t ) reaction at 2 gev over a range of triton emission angles from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "we have calculated the triton energy spectra in the framework of a quasi - elastic charge - exchange between a proton in the projectile and a neutron in the target nucleus .",
