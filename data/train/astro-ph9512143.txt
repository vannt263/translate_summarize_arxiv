    "a few years ago , we started a project to determine ages , metallicities , and reddenings of distinct stellar populations employing a newly developed technique of simultaneous multi - colour isochrone fitting ( roberts 1996 , grebel et al .",
    "when applying this technique to the young cluster ngc 330 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , we found a number of stars above the main - sequence turnoff , as indicated by our isochrone fit , but below the location of the blue supergiants ( sect .",
    "[ sect_photdata ] ) .",
    "when only photometric data are available , these bright blue stars would usually be considered main - sequence stars , which implies that either the cluster is much younger than our simultaneous multi - colour isochrone fit shows or forces the conclusion that there is a considerable age spread in star formation times .",
    "spectroscopy is needed in order to investigate the nature of these stars .",
    "we therefore obtained spectra to properly classify these stars ( sect .",

    "the number of stars normalized by area is constant .",

    "note that our isochrone fits the location of the blue and red supergiants . in past studies ,",
    "the stars above the main - sequence turnoff defined by our isochrone have either been considered ordinary main - sequence stars whose tip indicates the main - sequence turnoff ( carney et al .",
    "1985 ) or as main - sequence stars younger than the rest of the cluster , thus indicating an age spread .",
    "possible age spreads of 10 myr for geneva models ( bomans & grebel 1994 ) , 15 myr for semiconvective padua models , and as much as 38 myr for models with full overshoot ( chiosi et al .",

    "this might be an effect of small - number statistics , though on the other hand it seems strange that the supposedly ongoing star formation would not have resulted in the evolution of additional , younger supergiants .",

    "an order separation filter ( wg 360 ) with a cutoff at 360 nm was used to prevent second order overlap .",
    "the orientable slit allowed us to observe two target stars simultaneously . because of the wide slit we often obtained spectra of other stars as well in one exposure",
    "of course we did not get all the light from the other stars since some of them would be positioned on the edge of the slit .",
    "additional light loss occurred due to guiding errors ( an autoguider was not yet available at the 1.52 m telescope ) and refractory losses at higher airmasses .",
    "therefore no flux calibration was attempted , though we observed two spectrophotometric standards per night to determine the response curve of the instrument .",
    "the fwhm of the psf in spatial direction varied between @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in total",
    "we observed 20 stars located in the outer regions of the cluster ( not all of them blue ) .",
    "all spectra had exposure times of 30 min ( except for one exposure of 25 min ) .",
    "the raw data were reduced in the standard way , i.e. , bias subtracted and flatfielded by a normalized dome flat in order to remove pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "the individual spectra were extracted , sky - subtracted , and wavelength - calibrated using the dispersion relation from the he  ar comparison spectra . for the extinction correction the standard la silla extinction curve as incorporated into midas was used .",
    "an instrumental response curve was derived in the same way from the standard stars .",
    "then the target stars were response - corrected with this curve and rectified .",
    "the poor signal - to - noise ratio in the violet made it difficult to determine spectral types for the spectra from dec 93 .",
    "therefore the data from jul 94 were used whenever possible . for our spectral classifications we used digital versions of the ob star atlas of walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) and the spectral atlas by jacoby et al .",

    "the larger the inclination angle ( maximum @xmath119 equator - on ; common definition for equator - on : @xmath120 , collins 1987 ) of a b star toward us , the redder the star becomes , and , though still brighter than a non - rotating star , less luminous .",

    "both effects make them fainter than non - rotating counterparts .",

    "the position of the majority of the blue giants in the h - r diagram can be explained by their being be stars and thus shifted to lower effective temperatures and lower surface gravities due to effects of rotation and ( infra-)red excess .",
    "since ngc 330 is unusually rich in be stars ( grebel et al .",
    "1992 , 1994b ) , we will now discuss the hypothesis that all blue giants in ngc 330 are be stars , even though some do not show balmer emission at the moment . if all blue giants were be stars",
    ", this would imply that the stars vertically above the main sequence must be pole - on rotators .",
    "we assume that the rotational axes of these stars would have to be within about @xmath121 of the line of sight so that limb darkening and the small solid angle of the equatorial regions would make the stars significantly brighter and bluer ( and smaller angles would be significantly more effective ) . the solid angle within @xmath121 of _ both _ poles is about @xmath122 , so the probability of a be star s having such an orientation is roughly 1 in 8 . in our cmds of ngc 330 , we see nine blue giants that lie more or less vertically above the main sequence .",
    "if these are pole - on rotators , we expect approximately 63 non - pole - on be stars .",
    "rapid rotation may affect both b and be stars .",
    "furthermore , it has to be considered that pole - on rotators will not only be present above the main sequence , but also along the main sequence just as the be stars span a range of magnitudes . also , for our comparison of pole - on and non - pole - on rotators to be meaningful we must confine ourselves to stars only within the magnitude range that may give rise to the observed nine vertically displaced blue giants .",
    "thus we need to count b stars and be stars within one magnitude below the main - sequence turnoff ( and the be stars above it ) to establish a valid base of comparison .",
    "the number ratio is approximately 60 supposedly non - pole - on b and be stars versus nine possible pole - on rotators above the main sequence .",

    "statistically , the only possibility for all blue giants in ngc 330 with or without current h@xmath98 emission to be be stars is that _ all _ b stars in ngc 330 would have to undergo the be star phenomenon at some point of their evolution . if all bright b stars are rapid rotators this would suffice to explain the presence of the vertically displaced blue giants . as rapid rotators and/or be stars",

    "balona ( 1992 ) estimates from the mean periods and magnitudes of the 19 @xmath113 eri variables that he found in ngc 330 that the mean equatorial rotational velocity of these stars may be 375 km s@xmath117 , a relatively high value as compared to galactic @xmath113 eri variables .",

    "in fact there is mounting evidence that blue stragglers result from binary interactions ( stryker 1993 ) .",

    "it also has to be emphasized that all currently widely available evolutionary tracks and isochrones consider slow - rotating , single star evolution only .    in galactic open clusters ,",
    "widened main sequences , binary main sequences , and blue stragglers are well - known phenomena and common to clusters of all ages ( mermilliod 1992 ) .",
    "it is hardly surprising that the same effect should exist in the magellanic clouds .",
    "we suggest that blue giants or blue stragglers may be a common feature in young magellanic cloud clusters ( and possibly in clusters of all ages ) .",
    "this possibility should be carefully investigated since it has significant implications for the determination of ages and imfs in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the true nature of the stars at the apparent upper main sequence is of great significance for the determination of imfs .",
    "if the blue giants are all rapidly rotating single stars and single be stars , the upper imf will include stars of erroneously high masses since the inclination angle of a rapid rotator may shift it by up to one magnitude in m@xmath131 , which in turn implies a higher luminosity in the h - r diagram and a higher mass .    if the blue giants are binaries it becomes almost impossible to estimate their mass from their position in the cmd / h - r diagram .",
    "their current position is determined by the past mass exchange episodes and various evolutionary effects .",
    "we usually do not have information about the current state of the companion , nor do we know the initial mass ratio ( see also discussion in clarke & pringle 1992 ) , which would be needed for the determination of the imf .",
    "unresolved binaries may easily result in giving too large a weight to the upper mass bins of the imf if the star consists of two ( or more ) components that initially had roughly the same mass .",
    "unrecognized neutron - star or white - dwarf companions may lead to an underestimate of the mass of the visible component .",
    "if instead the blue giants are evolved stars , the upper mass bins of the imf will be underestimated since the masses of the main - sequence progenitors are likely to have been higher . however , as discussed we think we can exclude that these stars are evolved .",
    "if the binary fraction is known , one can make assumptions about the frequency distribution of different mass ratios and the contribution of these components to the imf .",
    "detailed comparisons with the predictions of the models of pols & marinus ( 1994 ) may help to constrain the binary fraction and the types of mass transfer .",
    "however , since stars do not need to be binaries to become be stars and since ngc 330 is so rich in be stars , we may see the combined result of two different effects : the rotational distortion and red excess for single be stars , and the main - sequence widening and blue ( be ) stragglers due to binarity . at this point",
    ", we do not see how these effects can be disentangled .",
    "some of the be stars may indeed be single stars , since balona ( 1992 ) found a number of @xmath113 eri variables among them , which are not considered binaries .",
    "on the other hand , the majority of the galactic be stars ( slettebak 1988 ) appear to be be stars .",
    "thus in addition to observational uncertainties and crowding , the determination of the imf of ngc 330 is severely affected by the above described effects , probably even more so than other magellanic cloud clusters because of its high fraction of be stars . as massey et al .",
    "( 1995 ) point out , spectral classifications in addition to photometry are a prerequisite for any imf determinations but as we have seen not even spectroscopy can give all the necessary information .",
    "we are still far from knowing `` typical '' imf slopes , let alone how the imf varies in different ( metallicity ) environments since especially binary fraction and binary mass ratios are unknown .",
    "synthetic cmds , e.g. , of pols & marinus may help with these problems , however , in the case of ngc 330 the code would need to be adjusted such that single be - star evolution and binary be - star evolution is taken into account .",
    "even then , reproducing what we see in ngc 330 would not necessarily lead to conclusive answers since there are many free parameters ( such as binary fraction , rotational velocities , initial mass ratios , be - star fraction and be lifetimes ) so that several combinations may reproduce the observed result .",
    "attempts to reproduce observed cmds of four young lmc clusters with synthetic cmds assuming binary fractions between 0 and 50% have been made by subramaniam & sagar ( 1995 ) .",
    "they note that in some cases , quite extreme binary fractions are required to reproduce the observations .",
    "subramaniam & sagar did not account for be stars in the synthetic cmds .",
    "the age calibration of magellanic cloud clusters is an important input parameter for population synthesis models .",
    "ages of magellanic clusters are in part based on integrated colours , a rather crude method , and in part on cmds obtained photographically or by ccd photometry .",
    "ages obtained from the cmds and isochrone fitting are being used to recalibrate ages based on integrated colours .",
    "integrated colours , in turn , provide an essential input base for population synthesis models .",
    "the properties of young clusters in particular are important for modeling active galaxies and starburst galaxies .    for example , bica et al .",
    "( 1990 ) investigated integrated spectra of lmc and smc clusters in the red and far - red ( 5601000 nm ) .",
    "they dated the red - supergiant phase to occur between 7 and 12 myrs .",
    "as we have shown , however , the much older cluster ngc 330 is heavily dominated ( 85% contribution in the @xmath132 band ) by red supergiants ( grebel 1995 , grebel et al .  in prep .",
    "bica et al .",
    "( 1990 ) based their age derivations on the integrated johnson ( ) @xmath133 and gunn ( u  v)@xmath133 colours and the apparent main - sequence turnoff visible in cmds .",
    "young magellanic clouds clusters with a high be star content like ngc 330 may appear bluer in integrated light due to the uv excess of some of these bright stars , than one would expect for a cluster of the same age without be stars .",
    "furthermore , a contribution to the uv flux may come from he stars formed in binary interactions ( pols et al.1991 , pols 1994 , pols & marinus 1994 ) .",
    "thus these clusters may be dated younger than they really are",
    ".    the age calibration of young magellanic cloud clusters will be off if blue stragglers are generally present , as they are in young galactic open clusters .",
    "if only photometric data with one colour index are used , unrecognized blue giants may place the turnoff region up to a magnitude or more too bright ( s.carney et al .",
    "1985 , sect .",
    "[ sect_photdata ] ) , depending on the age of the cluster .",
    "obviously , this leads to a systematic underestimation of the cluster age .",
    "the exact age that is derived strongly depends on the parameters of the underlying stellar models ( see chiosi et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "a first indicator for blue stragglers is the presence of stars above the main sequence and below the blue supergiant locus , if isochrones are fitted such that they include both the main - sequence band and the loci of blue and red supergiants .",
    "in fact , our simultaneous isochrone - fitting technique roberts 1996 ) in several colours does not accept the blue giants as part of the main sequence , and this is how we first identified them as anomalous , without spectroscopy . in absence of spectroscopy or multi - colour photometry , blue stragglers will not be recognized for what they are so that age spreads will be derived to fit their positions by isochrones as well ( sect .",
    "[ sect_photdata ] ) .",
    "the second implication of our findings on the age of ngc 330 is that an age spread , if present , is small and within the uncertainty of the age derived for ngc 330 from isochrone fitting that includes the supergiants .",
    "the stars in ngc 330 may be considered coeval within @xmath134 myr ( grebel 1995 , grebel et al .  in prep . ) .    if blue stragglers are generally present , large age spreads need no longer to be invoked to explain the morphology of a cmd .",
    "lack or presence of a considerable age spread in clusters will have important ramifications for theories of star formation .",
    "we believe that once spectroscopic data are available for a larger set of clusters , previously inferred age spreads will be much reduced .",
    "the discovery of blue giants in ngc 330 implies that this cluster is older than has been derived in several previous studies ( main - sequence turnoff is shifted to fainter magnitudes ) and that the previously inferred large age spread ( e.g. , chiosi et al .",
    "1995 ) is much smaller .",
    "the location of the blue and red supergiants is in agreement with the main - sequence turnoff inferred from spectral classifications and isochrone fitting .",
    "we reject the possibility that these stars are subgiants evolving from the main sequence towards the red - supergiant phase , since evolution proceeds so rapidly that it is unlikely to catch stars in this phase .",
    "considering that high - resolution spectroscopic studies of blue giants in ngc 330 did not show enhancement of both he and n and the accompanying c and o deficiency , we argue that the blue giants probably are not evolved stars such as post - red supergiants .",
    "we argue that rotational displacement effects due to rapid rotation and properties of be stars , which is what most of the blue giants are , can account for their position in the h - r diagram .",
    "departures from spherical symmetry as discussed by collins ( 1987 ) prevent the measurement of global @xmath112 and @xmath94 values and may , depending on the inclination angle , make stars appear as giants .",
    "we find that the simulations of the effects of binaries on cmds of young clusters by pols & marinus ( 1994 ) describe the observed cmd and h - r diagram morphology very well .",
    "these models account for a strongly widened main sequence , the presence of be stars , and blue unevolved stars above the main sequence through binary interactions and mass transfer that lead to the formation of blue stragglers .",
    "we suggest that the blue giants are most likely a mixture of ( 1 ) rapidly rotating b / be stars of varying orientation and ( 2 ) blue stragglers formed by interactions in binary systems . both possibilities are compatible with these stars being core h burning .",
    "faint short - periodic early - type eclipsing variables and blue straggler binaries have been found in the surroundings of ngc 330 ( sect .",
    "[ sect_bs2 ] ) , and we suggest additional observational tests to quantify the binary presence in ngc 330 . isochrones in the observational plane considering a certain binary fraction and rotational displacement rather than representing low - rotation , single - star evolution would be most useful .",
    "we discuss evidence that ngc 330 is not an exception in containing `` blue giants '' , and that blue stragglers are possibly also present in ngc 1818 , ngc 2004 , and ngc 2100 .",
    "we argue that unrecognized blue stragglers and binaries can severely impair the determination of imfs .",
    "they can also lead to an underestimation of the ages of young magellanic clusters and to the derivation of erroneously large age spreads in star formation times , as happened in the case of ngc 330 .",
