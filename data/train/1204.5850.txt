    "quantum entanglement , first noted by einstein - podolsky - rosen(epr ) @xcite and schrdinger @xcite is a genuine property of quantum mechanics .",
    "qualitative embodiment of this property was given by bell @xcite who showed that entangled states have stronger correlations than allowed by local hidden variable theories ( lhvt ) .",
    "later clauser and coworkers@xcite suggested a more transparent inequality ( b - chsh ) , the violation of which was experimentally demonstrated for photons@xcite .    during the last decade ,",
    "several works have been achieved in the context of mesoscopic physics to explore two particle entanglement .",
    "the initial proposals used superconducting sources of electrons connected to two normal metal leads , through which the two constituent electrons originating from a cooper pair were split to form a singlet state outside the superconductor@xcite .",
    "other proposals for two electrons entanglement were subsequently made using ballistic electrons and point contacts placed in the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) regime@xcite .",
    "bell inequality tests based on stationary current noise cross correlations revealed that a maximal violation could be achieved@xcite .    in the context of quantum optics , greenberger , horne and zeilinger introduced a maximally entangled tripartite state , commonly called the ghz - state@xcite .",
    "the bell parameter in the tripartite case can take values up to 4 , while the corresponding parameter in the bipartite case is no more than @xmath0@xcite .",
    "for both cases the lhvt limit remains 2 . in this sense",
    "the entanglement is considered to be `` stronger '' than for the two particle state , and it is thus potentially easier for experimental detection . ref . pointed out that the measurement results with this state are in conflict with local realism when quantum mechanics makes definite ( non statistical ) predictions , in contrast with epr states .",
    "the ghz state has a number of potential applications in quantum information .",
    "it can be used for quantum error correction @xcite , and it was proved that tripartite states have advantages compared to bipartite ones in quantum teleportation @xcite and in dense coding @xcite .",
    "there are two established methods to produce entangled states of electrons .",
    "the first method exploits the indistinguishability of fermions and relies on postselection to get the desired entangled state@xcite ( see also ref . for the discussion of the role of projection in this case ) .",
    "the second way is to use the interaction between particles ( implication of this method with flying electronic qubits is described in refs . ) .",
    "the latter has the advantage that the evolution during the preparation of the state is unitary and thus can be deterministic with up to 100% efficiency for producing the desired state .",
    "while there exist various ways to create and manipulate entangled states of qubits in optical systems@xcite and nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) experiments@xcite , in mesoscopic systems the generation of an experimentally determined entangled state of few electrons and the subsequent proof that bell inequalities have successfully violated both represent a considerable challenge . a proposal which follows faithfully the quantum optics experimental protocol@xcite uses edge states in the iqhe and achieves the ghz state using postselection .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to go beyond this existing protocol and thus to explore three particle orbital entanglement with ballistic electrons propagating in mesoscopic devices using the interaction between electrons .",
    "this proposal is motivated by the recent progress in achieving single electron sources@xcite and for buiding effective electron mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzis)@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ description_section ] , we describe the 3 mzi setup and specify how the beam splitters ( bs ) and coulomb interaction operate . in sec .",
    "[ ghz_section ] we justify that a ghz state is produced at the outcome . in sec .",
    "[ bell_section ] we describe the bell inequality test which is used to show that maximal entanglement is achieved . in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ]",
    "three electrons are injected simultaneously in the three mzis , and propagate from the bottom to the top of the figure .",
    "the crossing of the lines indicate a beam splitter ( bs ) , where an electron can exit in one of the two output branches .",
    "the dotted lines for each mzi show a third bs , used to explain theoretically the detection process .",
    "the dashed horizontal lines specify different levels of the setup which are used in the theoretical explanations.,width=283 ]    a schematic drawing of the device is depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] .",
    "it consists of three mzis , which are placed side by side ( shown with full lines in fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] ) .",
    "each mzi consists of two incoming channels , which meet at a first beam splitter ( bs ) .",
    "the two outgoing channels from these bs propagate and meet at the second bs .",
    "the theoretical setup also has a second loop ( shown with dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] ) , with propagation from the output channels of the second bs , and recombination at a third bs .",
    "we will use this second loop to explain theoretically the detection of the ghz states , and we will show in sec .",
    "[ detection_section ] that it is possible in practice to get rid of this second loop and perform the ghz state production and detection with a single loop .",
    "we distinguish the right ( r ) and left ( l ) side of each interferometer and label single electron wave functions accordingly .",
    "for instance , at any stage of the wave packet evolution , @xmath1 denotes an electron wave packet on the @xmath2 side ( @xmath3 ) of the @xmath4-th mzi ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the most likely candidates for electron channels are edge states in the iqhe regime , which have the advantage that they are immune to backscattering effects by impurities and have long phase breaking time .",
    "several experiments involving mzi in the iqhe have already been performed @xcite , some of them involving setups with two mzis .",
    "a proposal for a detailed setup is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : iqhe ] .",
    "we assume that a single electron wavepacket is emitted in each mzi above the fermi sea .",
    "such single electron emission was recently experimentally demonstrated with the on demand single electron source@xcite which uses the mesoscopic capacitor as the injector .",
    "the bs are assumed to be reflectionless , i.e. incident particles can not be backscattered in the same channel , they can only be transmitted further `` up '' ( in fig . [",
    "setup(f ) ] ) .",
    "the bs can be parametrized by a transfer matrix @xmath6 which relates incoming states to outgoing states and @xmath7 is the transparency parameter ( see fig.[fig : bs ] ) .",
    "for example if @xmath8 the beam - splitter is transparent meaning that the incident particle goes from r to l and from l to r without scattering , while for @xmath9 the incident particle may appear in each of output channels with equal probability @xmath10 .",
    "there exists an additional freedom in choosing the phases of scattering matrix elements but it does not affect results in a crucial manner ( see appendix [ bs_appendix ] for details ) .",
    "here we specify the bottom beam - splitters to have equal probability @xmath10 for transmission in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 side channels ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the transfer - matrix is then simply : @xmath13    this choice of the bottom beam - splitters as well as @xmath14 phase shift in coulomb interaction is analogous to the studies@xcite of two mach - zehnder interferometers . in each of them",
    "maximally entangled bipartite state was achieved when the first row of beam - splitters was half - reflecting .",
    "the main steps in the production of the ghz - state are as follows .",
    "the first stage is the synchronized injection of electrons ( dots with arrows at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] ) , which then pass through the first bs of each of the 3 mzis . beyond the first bs",
    ", free propagation occurs for electrons wave packets , until they reach the `` interaction region '' : the @xmath12 channel of the first mz and the @xmath11 channel of the second mz , and separately the @xmath12 channel of the second mz and the @xmath11 channel of the third mzi are put in close proximity so that coulomb interaction effects between the two pairs of neighbouring channels become important .",
    "the effective length of this interaction region is such that it generates an overall @xmath14 phase shift of the two particle wave function associated with the two neighbouring channels .",
    "it may be unclear why coulomb interaction would produce a phase shift because coulomb interaction involves energy exchange process . this matter and conditions required for the phase shift to be produced",
    "are discussed in appendix [ coulomb interaction . ] .",
    "after the interaction region the three electrons propagate freely towards the second bs , but we allow to insert a phase difference @xmath15 in each mz loop .",
    "the phase differences which are needed here could be achieved via the aharonov - bohm effect or via a scalar potential .",
    "actually aharonov - bohm and coulomb interaction phase accumulation occur together but logically the process can be decoupled into sequence of independent processes . from this point of view",
    "the aharonov - bohm phase effectively changes the transfer matrix of the following bs ( see appendix [ bs_appendix ] ) which is convenient for further calculations .",
    "the final stage of our setup is the measurement of the state of the three particle in the output arms ( top of fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] ) .        to understand the role of the interaction regions , let us consider first a given mzi with an electron injected into the right lead ( see fig .",
    "[ one_mzi(f ) ] ) .",
    "the electron in this interferometer could be treated as a `` flying qubit '' , i.e. a two - state system , where states are specified by the side chosen in the interferometer , where the electron travels .",
    "the initial state therefore is @xmath16 .",
    "after the bottom beam - splitter , at the level `` lv1 '' ( see fig .  [",
    "one_mzi(f ) ] ) , the state of the electron is @xmath17 next , we add a wire coupled to the interferometer with an electron injected simultaneously .",
    "so the initial state is @xmath18 .",
    "when two electrons pass the interaction zone they accumulate mutual phase @xmath14 . after interaction",
    "the two - particle state remains separable , and each particle has a wave - function . if the interaction occurs we get at the level `` lv2 '' for the left electron @xmath19 if we do not inject an electron into the right lead then at the level `` lv2 '' we have for the left electron @xmath20 these two outcomes are orthogonal to each other @xmath21 thus we can distinguish cases when 0 or 1 electrons travel in the neighbouring lead .",
    "moreover the relation @xmath21 is universal in the sense that it is preserved when we change the lead were electrons are injected in the mzi or when we place the wire to the left of the mzi ( as long as the bottom beam - splitter remains half - reflecting ) .",
    "we may put into correspondence to the wave function @xmath22 a qubit state @xmath23 and to @xmath24 a state @xmath25 .",
    "this makes our three mzi setup very similar to the situation displayed in fig .",
    "[ scheme_setup(fig ) ] .",
    "there we have a spin - based electron counter with spin flipping after one electron passes through a wire ( like it is described in ref . ) .",
    "this analogy between mzi and spin - based counter described here is helpful for understanding the nature of the ghz - state in the proposed setup ( fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] ) .    up to the level `` lv2 '' on fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] , the evolution can be represented in terms of spin - counters ( fig .",
    "[ scheme_setup(fig ) ] )     act like spin - counters ( large arrows on the figure ) coupled to left and right wire of middle mzi.,width=151 ]    after passing through the beam - splitter the electron state in the middle mzi is @xmath26 .",
    "depending on the arm from which electron came the corresponding spin flips .",
    "this produces the final state @xmath27 which is obviously a ghz - type state .",
    "we give here the detailed explanation about the ghz - state production .",
    "we find an exact expression for the electron state at the level `` lv2 '' on fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] , and we identify the local unitary transform making it a standard ghz state .",
    "`` local '' means that the unitary transform is a direct product of three unitary operators each acting over a hilbert space of a corresponding electron @xmath28 .",
    "specifically the initial three particle state is chosen to be ( see bottom of fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] ) : @xmath29 note that we choose a simple product state , instead of choosing a slater determinant of the three single particle wave functions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electron wave function do not have mutual parts of trajectories , so that exchange effects do not play any considerable role .    at the level `` lv1 '' after passing the first row of beam - splitters : @xmath30 in order to find the state after the coulomb interaction has acted , we rewrite the previous equation as @xmath31    the state after interaction ( at the lv2 ) : @xmath32    or in a more symmetrical way @xmath33 now it is easy to see the unitary transformation which produces the canonical ghz - state @xmath34 from  ( [ initial state ] ) .",
    "it should transform @xmath35 into @xmath36 , @xmath37 into @xmath38 , @xmath39 into @xmath40 , @xmath41 into @xmath41 , @xmath42 into @xmath43 , and @xmath44 into @xmath45 .",
    "this transform is @xmath46 where @xmath47    so , at the level `` lv2 '' of our setup  ( fig .",
    "[ setup(f ) ] ) we have the ghz - state up to a change of basis achieved by the transform  eq .",
    "[ transform ] .",
    "this transform could be performed by the second bs row between level `` lv2 '' and level `` ( lv2 ) '' .",
    "as one may notice , transformation @xmath48 does not correspond to any @xmath7 parameter in the formula for transfer matrix of beam - splitter ( [ eq : tmatrix ] ) .",
    "we may avoid this problem by choosing @xmath49 and shifting the ab phase in the next mz loop by @xmath50 .",
    "in reality we do not need this action because we intend to use `` condensed '' scheme where preparation and measurement are performed with one row of the beam - splitters ( see section [ section : condensed ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that from the quantum computation point of view we have an algorithm implemented on 3 flying qubits which is essentually similar to the coding scheme depicted on fig.10.2 . in nielsen - chuang@xcite .      in this work",
    "we stay focused on the creation of a ghz - state in its original form @xmath51 .",
    "however in some cases it might be useful to obtain more general ghz - type state such as @xmath52 with arbitrary @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "such a generalized state could be useful e.g. for quantum error correction.@xcite in our setup it is possible to get such a ghz - type state by a slight modification of the above presented method .",
    "we simply need to replace the half - reflecting bs in the second mzi with another one .",
    "as we pointed earlier in the general case the transfer - matrix of the bs can be represented as follows @xmath55 with this beam splitter in the second mzi the electronic wavefunction is : @xmath56 which is a generalized ghz state in a  rotated \" basis . using the same unitary transformation @xmath28 , where @xmath57 are defined in eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) , produces the generalized ghz - state in its canonical form .",
    "to detect the ghz - state experimentally we suggest to use a bell - type inequality violation test for three particles@xcite .",
    "let us discuss some basic facts about bell - type inequalities for 3 particles which constitute one of the possible generalizations of bell inequality on a tripartite case .",
    "we start from an algebraic inequality @xmath58 which is satisfied when @xmath59 are real variables with absolute values less or equal to @xmath60 ( this is a three particle generalization of the algebraic inequality used for bell inequality tests on two particles ) .",
    "consider a three particle entangled state , written in pseudospin notation ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , each particle can be detected in one of two leads l and r ) .",
    "the projection of the pseudospin of @xmath4 on some vector @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath64 while the projection on @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath66 . from the point of view of local hidden variable theories , after the creation of the three particle state , between the two measurements the first electron has projections @xmath67 , @xmath68 , the second one @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and the third one @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( @xmath73 if the spin is parallel to @xmath74 , and @xmath75 if it has opposite direction ) .",
    "different outcomes of measurements are due to a hidden variable @xmath76 which varies from measurement to measurement .",
    "we have identified the real numbers @xmath77 with @xmath78 . the average value of b is then given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the distribution function of the hidden variable .",
    "experimentally this value can be measured by the following procedure .",
    "let us define the correlator @xmath81 then @xmath82 and from eq .",
    "( [ algebraic ] ) the local hidden variable average is such that : @xmath83 from a quantum mechanical point of view , the correlator of eq .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) is an average over the state of an operator describing the measurement of three spins in specific directions : @xmath84 and @xmath85 where the analog of the `` bell operator '' for three particles reads @xmath86    in appendix [ ghz_appendix ] we recall under which conditions this bell operator gives a maximal violation of the bell type inequality .",
    "the demonstration is based on the fact that first , in order for @xmath87 to have an eigenvalue equal to @xmath88 , the state must be a linear superposition of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "second , the bell operator @xmath91 has eigenvalues @xmath92 only if the state is related to the ghz state : @xmath93 by local unitary transformations . finally , in this appendix , we specify which angles of spin measurement give the maximal value for @xmath94 .",

    "electrons then should be sent with a delay between them to reduce the interaction time and strength . the procedure for phase control",
    "may be developed in the same style as the ab - phase adjustment described in appendix  [ bs_appendix ] .",
    "one should tune the bottom beam - splitter in the second mzi to transfer incoming electrons to the adjacent edge state and set the ab - phase in the first mzi to @xmath150 .",

    "the latter rids of single particle detection while the former substitutes single electron sources .",
    "one can also express orbital correlators  ( [ measproc ] ) in terms of current - current correlators ( see refs .  ) .",
    "third order current correlation can be measured along the lines realized in ref .   or theoretically suggested in ref .  .",
    "still , in this case there is small hope for observation of bell inequality violation as it requires time correlated propagation of electrons for accumulation of definite phase ( @xmath14 ) with coulomb interaction , which is a very rare event in the constant voltage regime - the most probable event is no phase at all since electrons usually pass interaction region separately .",
    "therefore , in the constant voltage regime bell inequlity violation paradigm becomes impractical and one has to come back to the usual physics and compare the experiment with some specific theory .",
    "this approach does not have the main advantage of bell inequality violation which indicates entanglement without addressing to the details of the setup construction .",
    "instead , one has to measure irreducible third order current cross - correlators as a function of interaction strength and other parameters ( e.g. ab phases and bs transparencies )",
    ". from that function it should be possible to find a term originating from coulomb interaction which would indirectly indicate entanglement .",
    "this kind of observation would also be a significant step towards the realization and detection of ghz - state and electronic orbital states .",
    "in this article we have demonstrated , how to produce a generalized ghz states for 3 flying qubits , formed as orbital electron states in the mzi - type geometries .",
    "our setup relies on two state of the art devices of nanophysics : a ) single electron sources which have been demonstrated@xcite and characterized@xcite experimentally , as well as theoretically@xcite ; b ) mach zehnder interferometers , which have equally been the object of thorough experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite investigations . in our proposal",
    ", both devices should be integrated together , and moreover three mzi placed in parallel are needed to achieve the ghz state . while it is plausible to think that it will be challenging to build a prototype in the near future , we judge that it is useful for the mesoscopic physics community to be aware that advanced quantum information protocols  here the production of a ghz state  can be achieved with electrons .    at the beginning of the paper we justified that our ideal devices generate the ghz state .",
    "subsequently , we provided a detailed explanation of the type of bell inequalities which need to be used to prove unambiguously that we have generated the proper state .",
    "the problem which we encountered with the actual mzi setup which is needed to implement the bell test is that it requires 3 more mzi loops than `` condensed scheme '' , thus making the integration of the device even more challenging .",
    "fortunately , we provided a `` condensed detector scheme '' were this complication can be circumvented , arguing that the operations achieved by two bs in series can be combined with a single bs .",
    "this allowed to actually draw a `` realistic '' device inspired from the so called `` air bridge '' technique which is used in the experiments of ref . .",
    "this work thus belongs to the ongoing effort called `` electron quantum optics '' where experiments and paradigms of quantum optics are reproduced with mesoscopic physics devices .",
    "the great advantage of the present way for producing ghz states relies in the fact that no postselection procedure is needed here .",
    "the steps described in this paper rely on a unitary evolution of the initial state , and moreover , we exploit the coulomb interaction between electron wave packets in order to generate the desired phase shift on the electron wave function .",
    "this particular feature departs strongly from the photon protocols , as photons interact weakly when travelling in vacuum .",
    "we thus state that the use of electron - electron interactions in single electron devices schemes may open up new possibilities for quantum information schemes which are not envisionable for photons .",
    "granted the present work has addressed the case of an ideal device which is free from dephasing effects .",
    "such phenomena are likely to affect the operation of our device as they are already known to be present in single mzi electronic setups.@xcite nevertheless our top priority is to clarify how to implement an abstract quantum information schemes in an actual mesoscopic device",
    ". our analysis could be refined by taking dephasing effects into account .",
    "the authors plan to consider this in the future . in case of similar scheme with two mzi",
    "it is done in ref .",
    "also we pointed out some factors that need to be accounted for in experiment and mentioned simplified scheme with constant voltage instead of on - demand electron sources .",

    "we are interested in the properties of electron transport from bottom to top , so we will need only the values of @xmath224 .",
    "now we can introduce the transfer matrix : @xmath225 note that we have changed indexes because of the reflectionless nature of the bs : @xmath226 . in order to find the state of particles after the bs one must perform the following substitution with wave - functions before the beam - splitter : @xmath227",
    "since we have chosen a specific parametrisation of the bs , we must confirm that if the bs used in the experiment has a transfer matrix which is different from the one in eq .",

    "all beam - splitters have the same transfer matrix up to the phase accumulation in each channel .",
    "this phase accumulation can affect the phase difference in the left and the right paths of the mzi . in order to restore the original interference pattern we need to adjust the applied phase difference . during the experiment it means choosing a reference point with @xmath234 for given mzi .",

    "<S> we propose a new single - step scheme for the generation of a ghz entangled state of three single - electron excitations ( flying qubits ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a method to get a generalized ghz - state . </S>",
    "<S> our idea relies upon the most recent progress in the field of on - demand electron sources and mesoscopic mach - zehnder interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide the recipe for the unambiguous detection of this ghz state via correlations measurements at the output , which imply the violation of a bell - type inequality which is generalized to the case of three particles . </S>",
    "<S> we explain how such measurements can be achieved in the context of mach - zehnder interferometry , and draw an actual prototype device which could be achieved with point contacts and metallic gates placed on a gaas sample , in the integer quantum hall effect regime . </S>"
