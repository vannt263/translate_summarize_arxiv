    "based on the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite , we have recently initiated a systematic study of charmed and bottom hadrons in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the results imply that the formations of @xmath9-meson nuclear ( atomic ) bound states , and @xmath5 and @xmath1 hypernuclei are quite likely .",
    "the formations of @xmath5 and/or @xmath1 hypernuclei were first predicted in mid-1970s by tyapkin  @xcite , and dover and kahana  @xcite .",
    "later on theoretical studies  @xcite as well as possibility of experimental observation  @xcite were made .",
    "further , we have studied  @xcite the @xmath10 and @xmath1 hypernuclei by solving equations of motion for a system of hypernuclei , embedding a @xmath10 or a @xmath1 into the closed shell nuclear core , within the hartree , mean - field , approximation using the qmc model .",
    "the results again support the possible formation of @xmath5 and @xmath1 hypernuclei .    in this article",
    "we present the results for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 hypernuclei , as well as some of the @xmath10 and @xmath1 hypernuclei studied recently  @xcite .",
    "this is an extension of the studies made for the strange hypernuclei  @xcite , and a completion of our systematic study of charmed and bottom hypernuclei  @xcite in the qmc model .",
    "the extension is straightforward , since the heavy baryons ( as well as nucleon ) are classified by the naive constituent quark model , and qmc can treat them on the same quark - based footing .",
    "one of the other important issues in this study is a role of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 light quarks in nuclear medium , in the charmed or bottom baryons containing @xmath13 and/or @xmath14 quarks .",
    "this concerns the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear medium for heavy baryons .",
    "concerning the experimental possibilities , the approved construction of the japan hadron facility ( jhf ) with a beam energy of 50 gev , will produce charmed hadrons profusely and bottom hadrons in lesser numbers , but still with an intensity which is comparable to the present hyperon production rates .",
    "although the study of possible existence of charmed and bottom hypernuclei may be in its infancy at present , it is clear that conditions for the experiments to search for such heavy baryon hypernuclei are now becoming realistic , and would be realized at jhf  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is still meaningful to consider such heavy baryon hypernuclei at this stage for the future experimental studies .    the qmc model ( qmc - i ) , which is used in this study , has been successfully applied to many problems of nuclear physics , such as finite nuclei  @xcite , strange hypernuclei  @xcite , nuclear matter  @xcite , and other problems including hadronic properties in nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for earlier , different versions of qmc , and ref .",
    "@xcite for related work . ) for example , the model was applied to the study of meson nuclear bound states  @xcite , @xmath15 dissociation in nuclear matter  @xcite , @xmath16 and @xmath17 production in antiproton - nucleus collisions  @xcite , and kaon properties in nuclear matter and kaon production in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although only some limited studies for heavy mesons ( not for heavy baryons ) with charm in nuclear matter were made by the qcd sum rules ( for @xmath15  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite ) , a study for heavy baryons containing charm or bottom quarks was made only recently  @xcite using the qmc model .",
    "furthermore , recent measurements of polarization transfer in the @xmath19he(@xmath20)@xmath21h and @xmath22o(@xmath20)@xmath23n reactions performed at mami and jefferson lab  @xcite , support the medium modification of the proton electromagnetic form factors predicted by the qmc model  @xcite .",
    "there is also another version of the qmc model ( qmc - ii ) , where masses of the meson fields are also subject to the medium modification in a self - consistent manner  @xcite .",
    "however , for a proper parameter set ( set b ) the typical results obtained in qmc - ii are very similar to those of qmc - i .",
    "the difference is @xmath24 % for the largest case , but typically @xmath25 % or less .",
    "( for the effective masses of the hyperons , the differences between the two versions of qmc turn out to be less than @xmath26 % .",
    "see also fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite for the differences in the scalar potentials for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 mesons in @xmath29pb nucleus . )",
    "since we use qmc - i , the differences in these numbers may be regarded as uncertainties in the model .    certainly , the model has shortcomings that have to be improved eventually .",
    "difficulties to handle the model will increase rapidly in handling the hartree - fock approximation even for nuclear matter  @xcite , and further to include the pauli blocking effect at the quark level .",
    "in addition , the @xmath30 channel coupling effect has not been implemented yet in a consistent manner with the underlying quark degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that in the case of larger mass number @xmath31 hypernuclei , no narrow states have been observed experimentally , although @xmath32he was confirmed  @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely to find such ( narrow ) bound states in the present situation , where the experimental analysis  @xcite supports the suggestion made by harada  @xcite , that a large isospin dependent @xmath31-nucleus potential term exists and the 1/a ( a : baryon number ) dependence of that term reduces the likelihood of observing bound states for @xmath33 .",
    "this unlikeliness may also arise from the width of @xmath31 state due to strong @xmath34 conversion .",
    "furthermore , an application to double hypernuclei has not been attempted , although recently the existence was confirmed for small baryon number nuclei  @xcite . as an attempt to improve the model ,",
    "the effect of short - range quark - quark correlations associated with the nucleon overlap was studied in ref .  @xcite . with the addition of the correlations , the saturation curve for symmetric nuclear matter",
    "was greatly improved at high density . despite the shortcomings of the model described above , there are some positive aspects of this model , its simplicity and successful applicability , that we feel confident that the qmc model will provide us with a valuable glimpse into the properties of charmed and bottom hypernuclei .    in the qmc model ,",
    "the interactions between nucleons are mediated by the exchange of scalar ( @xmath35 ) and vector ( @xmath28 and @xmath36 ) fields self - consistently coupled directly to the quarks within those nucleons , but not to the nucleons as in quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd )  @xcite .",
    "thus , it can be systematically applied to study the properties of any hadrons in nuclear medium  @xcite ( if they contain @xmath13 and/or @xmath14 light quarks ) .",
    "we make use of this advantage of the qmc model , and study the charmed and bottom hypernuclei .",
    "we hope that the present study inspires some interest to measure the properties of heavy baryons in nuclear medium , at facilities like jhf , particularly at rhic ( high energy relativistic heavy ion facilities ) , and in very high energy experiments at cern and fermilab .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section  2",
    ", the relativistic formulation of the charmed and bottom hypernuclear system in the qmc model will be explained briefly .",
    "a mean - field lagrangian density and equations of motion will be given in section  2.1 , while charmed and bottom hadrons in nuclear matter will be discussed in section  2.2 . in section  3 , the effects necessary for a realistic calculation for the charmed ( bottom ) hypernuclei will be described .",
    "spin - orbit potential , and the effect of the pauli blocking at the quark level will be explained in sections  3.1 and 3.2 , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath37 channel coupling effect will be explained in section  3.2 .",
    "the results for the charmed and bottom hypernuclei will be presented in section  4 , and finally section  5 will be devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in this section , we briefly explain the mean - field equations of motion for a charmed or bottom hypernuclear system , and review some properties of the charmed and bottom baryons in nuclear matter .",
    "we consider static , approximately spherically symmetric charmed and bottom hypernuclei , i.e. , closed shell nuclear core plus one charmed or one bottom baryon ( heavy baryon ) configuration , ignoring non - spherical effects due to the embedded heavy baryon .",
    "the existence of the heavy baryon inside or outside of the nuclear core ( in particular , @xmath1 which interacts relatively strong with core nucleons ) breaks spherical symmetry , and one should include this effect in a truly rigorous treatment .",
    "we have neglected this effect , since it is not expected to be so important for spectroscopic calculations  @xcite for the middle and/or large baryon number charmed hypernuclei ( but may not be true for @xmath1 hypernuclei ) , and beyond the scope of present study .",
    "however , we include the response of the nuclear core arising from the self - consistent calculation , which is a purely relativistic effect  @xcite .",
    "thus , we always specify the state of the heavy baryon in which the calculation is performed , because the core nucleus response is different due to the self - consistent calculation .",
    "( this self - consistent procedure will be applied also when the effective pauli blocking and/or @xmath38 are introduced later . )    we adopt the hartree , mean - field , approximation . in this approximation",
    "the @xmath39 tensor coupling contributes to a spin - orbit force for a nucleon bound in a static spherical nucleus , although in hartree - fock it also contributes a central force  @xcite .",
    "( furthermore , it gives no contribution for nuclear matter since the meson fields are independent of position and time . )",
    "thus , we ignore the @xmath39 tensor coupling in this study as in ref .  @xcite",
