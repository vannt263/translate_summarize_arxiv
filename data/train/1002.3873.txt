    "it was nearly 50 years ago that askaryan proposed to detect high energy particles through the coherent pulse they emit as they interact in a dense medium  @xcite .",
    "as secondary electrons , positrons and gamma rays are produced they develop electromagnetic showers in the medium which acquire an excess negative charge , which askaryan estimated to be of order @xmath0 of the total number of electrons and positrons .",
    "this is so in spite of the interactions being completely charge symmetric , because matter in the medium only contains electrons .",
    "mller , bhabha and compton scattering of matter electrons , accelerate them into the shower while electron - positron annihilation and bhabha scattering decelerate the shower positrons thus also contributing to the excess charge , a mechanism referred to as the askaryan effect .",
    "a more accurate calculation of the askaryan effect indicated that the excess charge is actually @xmath1 of the total number of electrons and positrons  @xcite .",
    "such an excess charge develops a coherent electromagnetic pulse as it travels through a non absorptive dielectric medium .",
    "the coherent part of the pulse is mainly due to the wavelength components which are large compared to the shower width .",
    "the energy radiated in the coherent pulse scales with the square of the excess charge and hence with the square of the shower energy .",
    "such scaling naturally makes the detection of coherent radio pulses an attractive and promising technique for the detection of ultra high energy particles , such as cosmic rays .",
    "radio detection of air showers was extensively studied in the 60 s and 70 s  @xcite .",
    "the drive to detect high energy neutrinos in the late 80 s turned back the attention onto radio pulses produced by them in dense media such as natural ice  @xcite or the regolith beneath the moon s",
    "surface  @xcite .",
    "the first full simulations of the askaryan effect and the coherent pulses created in dense media were obtained in the early 90 s  @xcite , which allowed more quantitative calculations and experimental programs were soon after started to search for neutrinos with arrays of antennas at antarctica  @xcite or with radio telescopes from earth  @xcite .",
    "the askaryan effect was measured for the first time firing photon bunches into sand at slac in 2000  @xcite - and later in other dielectric media including ice @xcite - and since then the field has received an enormous boost , strengthening previous initiatives using antennas buried in ice  @xcite and radiotelescopes  @xcite , and developing new ones such as a balloon flown antenna array  @xcite , new radiotelescope searches  @xcite and new radio measurements of air showers @xcite .",
    "the first calculation of the radio emission from electromagnetic showers used a specifically designed monte carlo simulation code - the zhs code - to calculate coherent radio pulses in ice  @xcite .",
    "the code has been extended to include the lpm effect  @xcite , to calculate in an approximate manner hadronic showers  @xcite and neutrino - induced showers @xcite , to treat other dielectric media  @xcite , and to perform an optimal statistical thinning that allows the simulation of pulses from ultrahigh energy showers  @xcite , and remains as a reference in the field .",
    "this code was designed to calculate the fourier components of the electric field in the frequency domain .",
    "alternative simulations using other codes such as geant3 @xcite , geant4  @xcite and the aires+tierras  @xcite code , have yielded results compatible to within @xmath2 .",
    "semi - analytical calculations have also been performed @xcite .",
    "all of these use the same technique to calculate the radio pulse in the frequency domain , but to our knowledge no full calculation exists in the time domain yet .    all experimental arrangements measure the electric field as a function of time , and full understanding of the properties of the pulse as a function of time is thus also very important .",
    "although the conversion from the frequency to the time domain is in principle straightforward and the algorithm in zhs computes all required information to obtain it , there have been a number of doubts concerning the unconventional choice of fourier transform as used in the code  @xcite , as well as the sign , phase and causality properties of the pulse @xcite , that have complicated the analysis and interpretation of data .    in this article",
    "we develop a formalism to calculate the pulse directly in the time domain .",
    "we simultaneously calculate the pulse of the same electromagnetic shower in both the time and frequency domains .",
    "an exhaustive comparison yields fully compatible results , makes patent the relative advantages of each approach , and sheds new light into the properties of the radio pulse in the time domain which can be related to those of the shower and can be of great practical importance in interpreting actual data .",
    "some of these properties are discussed in more detail suggesting possible applications .",
    "although the method developed in  @xcite , and extended here to the time - domain , has been obtained in the framework of erenkov radiation , it derives directly from maxwell s equations and addresses classical radiation from charges in a pretty general fashion .",
    "simple extensions of this work can be used for instance to calculate transition radiaton as particles cross dielectric media interfaces or to calculate the complete radiation patterns from charges moving in magnetic fields including erenkov radiation , as has been known for long to be important for ultra high energy air showers .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] we rederive the expression for the electric field in both the time and frequency domain in a form that can be easily used for practical applications and make the connection to the expression derived in the original zhs paper @xcite .",
    "we also discuss some simple current density models and relate them to the results of a full electromagnetic shower simulation . in section [ results ]",
    "we perform a consistency check by fourier - transforming the pulse in time and comparing it to the frequency spectrum obtained in the simulations .",
    "the summary and outlook constitute the last section .",
    "we start from maxwell s equations for linear , isotropic , homogeneous and non dispersive media . in the international system of units : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the charge density of the source , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the total permittivity and permeability expressed in terms of the relative ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and free space ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) permittivities and permeabilities .",
    "all effects of induced currents and electric polarization are automatically accounted for by the displacement field @xmath11 proportional to the electric field , @xmath12 and the magnetic field strength @xmath13 , proportional to the magnetic field , @xmath14 .",
    "we recall the formal solution introducing the vector and scalar potentials ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 that naturally satisfy @xmath18 , and the equation involving the @xmath19 term . choosing the transverse gauge , in which @xmath20 ,",
    "the two remaining equations imply : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transverse current , a divergenceless component of the current density , which in the limit of observation at large distances from the source can be shown to correspond to the projection of the current density perpendicular to the direction of observation ( of unit vector @xmath23 ) , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "both equations can be formally solved using green s functions : @xmath25 the first is the familiar solution from electrostatics for the potential produced at the position @xmath26 by a source with charge density @xmath27 .",
    "the second is the solution of the wave equation with wave velocity @xmath28 smaller than the velocity of light in vacuum , @xmath29 , by a factor @xmath30 , the index of refraction .",
    "the green s function for the wave equation involves a delta function that gives the familiar retarded time , @xmath31 , earlier than the observing time @xmath32 . to evaluate the field at time @xmath32 at a given position @xmath26 , the current is to be evaluated at a time retarded by the time taken by light to reach observation point from point @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "we consider the shower as a superposition of finite particle tracks of constant velocity .",
    "each track is completely defined by two limiting times @xmath35 and @xmath36 , its velocity @xmath37 and the position vector of an arbitrary point of the track , @xmath38 , which we have chosen to correspond to the time @xmath39 . the transverse current density entering in eq .",

    "we can now substitute the transverse current into eq.([asol ] ) , integrate the three dimensional delta function substituting @xmath33 for @xmath44 and approximate the distance between @xmath26 and @xmath33 by @xmath45 , where we define @xmath46 . in the limit of large distances of observation",
    "the denominator @xmath47 can be simply approximated by @xmath48 .",
    "however , we must use the above approximation in the argument of the retarding delta function to account for interference effects .",
    "this corresponds to the fraunhofer approximation , in which the path difference between light pulses emitted at points @xmath38 and @xmath49 is simply the distance between them projected onto the direction of observation . as a result",
    "the delta function reads @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , which can be cast into : @xmath52 we note that the recurring factor @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the angle between @xmath37 and @xmath23 , gives zero for the erenkov angle @xmath55 .",
    "moreover the factor changes sign from positive to negative as the observation angle changes from being larger to smaller than the erenkov angle .",
    "now we can perform the integration in @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ asol ] ) which simply implies replacing @xmath31 in the step functions by @xmath56 .",
    "we now make use of the fact that : @xmath57 in this equation we can take @xmath58 and @xmath59 which allows us to rewrite eq.([asol ] ) as : @xmath60 note that the modulus in the denominator of eq.([delta ] ) is removed because of an effective @xmath61 that appears when changing the argument in the two step functions ( according to eq .",

    "this expression can also be implemented in a shower simulation provided a suitable approximation is made for the delta function .",
    "the expression for the electric field is given by eq .",

    "see also text for more details.,width=340 ]    the radiation field due to a single particle track with @xmath71 is similar to the schematic diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : track_field ] .",
    "such a particle produces radiation when the track starts or ends .",
    "the two pulses  as seen \" by the observer ( placed at angle @xmath54 w.r.t .",
    "the particle track ) are separated by a time interval associated to the difference in propagation time @xmath72 .",
    "let us first consider an angle exceeding the erenkov angle so that @xmath73 is positive .",
    "the electric field of the first pulse corresponds to the start point of the track ( @xmath35 ) and it is anti - parallel to @xmath42 according to eq.([etime ] ) , while it is parallel for the second pulse which corresponds to the end point ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the sign of the electric field pulse is opposite to the sign of the particle acceleration in both cases .",
    "the zero in the shown arrival time is arbitrary and corresponds to @xmath74 , i.e. it is a reference time associated to the arrival of a signal from the reference position @xmath38 .",
    "the two pulses associated with the track take place later than this reference time .    as the angle decreases and becomes smaller than the erenkov angle , the situation is reversed : the first pulse corresponds to the end point of the track ( @xmath36 ) , while the second corresponds to the start point ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "moreover not only is the arrival of the pulses as seen by the observer inverted , but both take place before the reference time .",
    "this apparent acausal behavior is due to the fact that the particle travels at a speed greater than that of light in the medium .",
    "although the terms responsible for the first and second pulses are interchanged , and there is a sign change associated with this interchange , it is compensated by the denominator of eq.([efield ] ) that also reverses its sign . as a result",
    "there is no change in the sign of the electric field of the first and second pulses as the erenkov angle is crossed , and the double peak structure at any given time has the same qualitative behavior as the observation angle changes .",
    "this seems physically sound since there can be no discontinuity of the electric field across the erenkov cone boundary .    for observation at the erenkov angle both signals",
    "arrive simultaneously . in this limiting case",
    "the electric field can be formally obtained taking minus the derivative of the delta function given by eq.([atimecerlimit ] ) .",
    "this again corresponds to a double pulse first antiparallel and then parallel to @xmath42 .",
    "the expression for the electric field in the frequency domain used in the zhs simulation code ( eq.(12 ) in  @xcite ) reads : @xmath75 \\label{efreq}\\ ] ] we recall that this equation has been obtained with the following convention for the fourier transform of the electric field : @xmath76 where the factor 2 corresponds to an unusual convention ( this factor is usually either 1 or @xmath77 ) .",
    "applying this fourier transform definition to eq.([etime ] ) giving the electric field in the time domain we obtain : @xmath78{\\rm t}_1}-   { \\rm e}^{i \\omega \\left[n r / c + ( 1-n\\beta\\cos\\theta)\\right]{\\rm t}_2 }   \\over ( 1-n\\beta\\cos\\theta ) }   \\end{split}\\ ] ] which can be easily rearranged to give exactly eq .",
    "( [ efreq ] ) noting that @xmath79 .",
    "moreover if we apply the fourier transform to eq.([atimecerlimit ] ) which applies to the limit @xmath80 we get : @xmath81 the electric field is obtained taking minus the time derivative which in fourier space is just a factor @xmath82 , giving again the same result as eq.(13 ) in @xcite for the electric field in the frequency domain at the erenkov angle .",
    "these calculations show the consistency of eq.([etime ] ) obtained in the time domain with eq.([efreq ] ) which gives the field in the frequency domain : they are simply fourier transforms of each other as expected .      before performing a monte carlo simulation of electromagnetic showers",
    ", it is interesting to extend the calculations to simple models for the shower .",
    "these models allow us to obtain relations between the shape of the pulse in the time domain and the time and spatial distribution of the charge .",
    "a simple yet interesting model consists of a charge @xmath83 that rises and falls along the shower direction @xmath84 and spreads laterally in @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "assuming cylindrical symmetry we can write the current associated to this charge distribution as : @xmath87 here @xmath88 is a two dimensional vector in the @xmath89 plane transverse to @xmath84 , and the function @xmath90 gives the charge distribution in such a plane as a function of shower depth , with normalization chosen so that @xmath91 indeed gives the excess charge : @xmath92 with @xmath93 the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the simplest case is that of a line current along the @xmath84 direction without lateral extension in which @xmath94 is replaced by the two dimensional delta function @xmath95 .",
    "this approximation was also discussed in @xcite in the frequency domain , where it was referred to as the one - dimensional approximation .",
    "when such line current is substituted into eq.([asol ] ) and integrated in @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath31 making the fraunhofer approximation , a relatively simple expression is obtained that relates the vector potential in the time domain to the excess charge @xmath83 : @xmath96 \\end{split } \\label{alinecurrent}\\ ] ] the delta function relates the depth in the shower development @xmath84 to the observation time @xmath32 through a linear function : @xmath97 as the observation angle approaches the erenkov angle , the time interval corresponding to the depth spanned by the shower , i.e. the pulse width , becomes smaller .",
    "we thus recover a familiar result already discussed in @xcite although in the frequency domain .    performing the integration in eq.([alinecurrent ] )",
    "yields , @xmath98 where the delta function in eq.([alinecurrent ] ) introduces a factor @xmath99 .    the electric field is obtained taking minus",
    "the derivative of the vector potential with respect to time : @xmath100 the factor @xmath101 arises from applying the chain rule to the derivative of @xmath102 $ ] . as a result the pulse in the time domain can be regarded as the derivative of the development of the charge excess along the shower , scaled with the herenkov factors @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and converted from depth into time through eq.([depthtotime ] ) , i.e. , the pulse is firstly positive and then negative with respect to @xmath42 since in a real shower @xmath83 corresponds to an excess of negative charge .",
    "a number of interesting results can be directly read off eq.([elinecurrent ] ) .",
    "if the development curve for the excess charge @xmath83 is not symmetric , as happens in real showers , the asymmetry in its derivative is directly reflected into an asymmetry between the negative and positive parts of the pulse .",
    "also it is interesting to note that when the angle of observation is below the erenkov angle , the pulse shape is inverted in time because the early part of the pulse corresponds to the end of the shower while the beginning of the shower corresponds to the end part of the pulse , as explained above .",
    "still , the polarity of the first and second pulses remains the same because , although the slopes before and after shower maximum change sign , there is an extra sign change induced by the factor @xmath103 .",
    "this is in complete analogy to what was discussed for a single track .    in the case of observation in the erenkov direction ,",
    "the @xmath84 dependence of the delta function in eq.([alinecurrent ] ) disappears and the delta function can be factored away from the integral , to give a pulse of amplitude directly proportional to the integrated excess track length of the shower .",
    "the delta function term is due to all parts of the line current being observed simultaneously at the erenkov angle .",
    "these are two familiar results already emphasized in @xcite .",
    "the simulation has shown that the model with the absence of a lateral distribution breaks down at @xmath105 .",
    "this result is consistent with that found in @xcite where the one dimensional model was studied in the frequency domain .",
    "it is instructive to extend the line current model to a more realistic three dimensional current @xmath106 with cylindrical symmetry and current given in eq.([linecurrent ] ) . in that case",
    "the expression for the vector potential with two delta functions can be integrated in @xmath31 and @xmath93 and the resulting expression involves a double integral over cylindrical coordinate @xmath107 and the shower depth @xmath84 : @xmath108 ^ 2-\\left[z'\\left(1-n\\beta\\cos\\theta\\right)-\\left(vt - n\\beta r\\right)\\right]^2 } } \\end{split } \\label{alateral}\\ ] ] this expression , despite being more cumbersome than eq.([alinecurrent ] ) , if solved analytically for realistic lateral distribution functions , could give insight into useful parametrizations of the pulse in the time domain .",

    "this model still has some limitations .",
    "note that eq.([alateralcerenkov ] ) predicts a pulse that is symmetric in time while simulations have shown that the pulse at the cerenkov angle is asymmetric .",
    "this is due in part to the radial distribution of velocities of the shower which is not included in the model . the development of a current density vector model that can accurately produce the features of erenkov radiation is work in progress .",
    "the zhs monte carlo @xcite allows the simulation of electromagnetic showers and their associated coherent radio emission up to eev energies @xcite .",
    "originally developed in ice @xcite , it has been extended so that electromagnetic showers in other dielectric homogeneous media can be simulated @xcite .",
    "the code accounts for bremsstrahlung , pair production , and the four interactions responsible for the development of the excess charge , namely mller , bhabha , compton scattering and electron - positron annihilation .",
    "in addition multiple elastic scattering ( according to molire s theory ) and continuous ionization losses are also implemented .",
    "the electron / positron tracks between each interaction are split into subtracks so that no subtrack exceeds a maximum depth fixed at 0.1 radiation lengths . for low energy particles these subdivisions",
    "are actually reduced to ensure that no subtrack is comparable to the particle range , and they become the step used to evaluate ionization losses and multiple elastic scattering . convergence of results as the step is reduced has been carefully checked @xcite .    in order to account for interference effects between the radiation emitted due to the particles responsible for the excess negative charge , the zhs code was designed to follow all electrons and positrons down to 100 kev kinetic energy threshold , as well as to carefully account for time , by considering deviations with respect to a plane front moving at the speed of light injected in phase with the primary particle .",
    "in addition to the delays associated to the propagation geometry , those due to particles travelling at velocities smaller than the velocity of light are accounted for assuming the energy loss is uniform across the step .",
    "an approximate account is also made of the time delay associated to the multiple elastic scattering processes along the step .    as a result",
    "the tracks of all charged particles in a shower are divided into multiple subtracks which are assumed to be straight and to have constant velocity .",
    "the positions of the end points of these subtracks as well as the corresponding times are readily available by design , and they can be used to compute the frequency components of the electric field making extensive use of eq.([efreq ] ) , taking into account the relative phase shift between different tracks because of their different starting point positions and time delays .    in this work",
    "we have extended the monte carlo to also calculate the pulse in the time domain .",
    "a routine has been developed to account for contributions of each of these particle subtracks to the vector potential , making extensive use of eq.([atime ] ) .",
    "each subtrack contributes a unit `` rectangle '' to the vector potential , which varies in height , `` duration '' and sign - see fig .",
    "[ fig : track_field ] , depending on the velocity , the relative orientation of the track with respect to the direction of observation and the charge of the particle .",
    "when the observation direction is very close to the erenkov angle the delta function in eq.([atimecerlimit ] ) is replaced by a rectangle corresponding to a nascent delta function  @xcite . if the sampling time bin width is set to @xmath113 then a natural choice of nascent delta function is given by @xmath114 in this case the base of the rectangle is fixed by the intrinsic `` time resolution '' @xmath113 of the simulation and the pulse height depends on @xmath113 . in practice",
    ", the time domain radio signal can be reconstructed with an antenna receiver system and digital sampling electronics .",
    "the time resolution of a single waveform is determined by the digital sampling bin width and the high frequency cutoff of the receiver system .",
    "once the vector potential induced by each subtrack is defined , the contribution of all charged subtracks in the shower is obtained and the vector potential is derived with respect to time to obtain the electric field in the time domain .    in the next section we show several examples of the results of this procedure .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : efield ] we show the electric field as a function of arrival time of the signal obtained with the zhs code in a single 1 pev electron - induced shower in ice for different observation angles .",
    "the zero in the shown arrival time is measured with respect to the arrival time of a pulse emitted as the primary particle initiating the shower is injected in the medium .",
    "( long green dashes ) and at @xmath115 ( short blue dashes ) . in the bottom panel",

    "this is expected after the discussion in section  [ singletrack ] of the electric field emitted by a single positively charged particle , with the important difference that in a shower the electric field is produced by an excess of negative charge and the polarity of the field is reversed with respect to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : track_field ] . also as in the case of a single track there is no change in the polarity of the pulse when observing inside ( @xmath117 ) or outside ( @xmath118 ) the erenkov cone ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the pulse always starts being positive ( parallel to @xmath120 ) and ends being negative ( antiparallel to @xmath120 ) regardless of the observation angle .",
    "this feature can be used as a discriminator against background events for neutrino searches .",
    "it can be also clearly seen that the pulse is broader in time away from the erenkov cone than close to it with an apparent duration proportional to @xmath121 with @xmath122 being the spread along the shower axis of the excess charge ( see eq.([depthtotime ] ) ) . for observation at the erenkov angle",
    "the apparent duration of the pulse is not zero , despite the fact that the erenkov factor @xmath123 , because the shower spreads out also in the lateral dimensions ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 directions ) . also due to our definition of @xmath39 and to the presence of the erenkov factor in the @xmath126functions in eq.([etime ] ) , the pulse occurs at @xmath127 outside the erenkov cone and at @xmath128 inside it .    .",

    "the zhs code also gives the longitudinal profile of the excess charge and we have applied eq.([elinecurrent ] ) to the simulated @xmath116 , and compared to the electric field obtained directly in the monte carlo .",

    "[ fig : efield ] . the agreement between the electric field obtained directly in the monte carlo simulation ( dashed histograms ) and what is predicted by eq.([elinecurrent ] )",
    "( solid histograms ) is remarkable .",
    "the electric field follows the variation of the excess charge in @xmath129 or equivalently in @xmath32 .",
    "this explains why for a fixed observation angle the pulse changes sign from early to late times ( for a typical shower @xmath116 grows relatively fast , reaches a maximum , and then decreases more slowly with depth ) , and why it is asymmetric with respect to the time axis ( @xmath116 is not a symmetric function around its maximum ) .",
    "also when the direction of observation is inside the erenkov cone , the observer sees the derivative of the beginning of the excess charge distribution first and the corresponding derivative of the end of @xmath116 at later times , while the opposite is true for observations outside the erenkov cone . as a consequence",
    "the pulse at @xmath117 looks like an antisymmetric copy with respect to @xmath39 of the pulse at @xmath118 , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : efield ] . an accurate reconstruction of the time domain electric field could in principle determine on which side of the cerenkov cone the event was observed . on the other hand",
    "the shape of the pulse can be conversely used to infer the depth development of the shower .",
    "eq.([elinecurrent ] ) stresses the fact that the features of the excess charge distribution are  mapped \" in the time structure of the pulse .",
    "in particular it is well known that electromagnetic showers with energies above the energy scale at which the lpm effect @xcite starts to be effective ( @xmath130 pev in ice @xcite ) , are  stretched \" in the longitudinal dimension and often show peaks in their profile @xcite .",
    "these two features should translate into the duration in time also of the pulse and into its time structure that should also exhibit multiple peaks .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efield_lpm ] in which due to the lpm effect the longitudinal profile of a 100 pev electron - induced shower exhibits two peaks which appear as 2 positive and 2 negative peaks in the time structure of the pulse . for comparison a 1 pev electron - induced shower not affected by the lpm effect and its corresponding electric field are also shown .",
    "the linear relation between the time domain structure of an electric field and the shower profile suggests that the longitudinal profile of the shower could be reconstructed from an observation off the erenkov angle .",
    "the extended zhs code is able to calculate both the electric field as a function of time and its fourier transform from first principles .",
    "moreover , the two calculations can be made simultaneously for the same shower .",
    "both calculations can be easily compared by performing the fourier transform of the pulse calculated in the time domain , following the convention in eq.([ft ] ) .",
    "this provides a further check of the two methods , as well as a test of accuracy in the numerical procedures involved in the calculation of the radio emission in both domains .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efieldft ] , where the electric field as a function of frequency as obtained in zhs simulations of a single 1 pev electron - induced shower is plotted along with the ( fast ) fourier transform ( fft ) of the electric field in the time domain obtained in simultaneous zhs simulations of the same shower .",
    "the agreement between both spectra is very good for frequencies below @xmath131 with @xmath113 an arbitrary time resolution needed for the zhs simulations in the time domain .",
    "we do not expect to be able to reproduce the frequency spectrum at frequencies above @xmath132 - proportional to the nyquist frequency of the system . to illustrate this point in fig .",
    "[ fig : efieldft ] we also show the fourier transformed spectrum ( at the erenkov angle ) of several time domain calculations performed with different time resolutions @xmath133 and 0.5 ns .",
    "one can see that the agreement between the frequency spectrum obtained in zhs and the fourier transformed time domain electric field improves as @xmath113 decreases as expected .",
    "calculations in the frequency domain are more advisable near the erenkov angle .",
    "ns ( red solid lines ) and @xmath134 ns ( magenta dotted line - only shown at the erenkov angle for clarity).,width=340 ]",
    "in this work we have developed an algorithm to obtain the erenkov radio pulse produced by a single charged particle track in a dielectric medium .",
    "we have implemented this algorithm in the zhs monte carlo with which we can predict the erenkov coherent radio emission emission of electromagnetic showers in dense dielectric media in both the time and frequency domains .",
    "an observer in the fraunhofer region , far from the axis of the electromagnetic shower at an angle @xmath54 , sees a bi - polar pulse due to the excess of negative charge in the shower .",
    "the apparent time duration of the pulse is proportional to @xmath135 with @xmath122 the spread of the shower in the longitudinal direction . at the erenkov angle @xmath136 and the duration of the pulse",
    "is mainly determined by the lateral extent of the shower . at angles",
    "@xmath137 , the observer sees first the electric field produced by the early stages of the shower , and the field due to the end of the shower later on , while the time sequence reverses for observation at @xmath138 .",
    "regardless of the observation angle , the bulk of the electric field due to the excess negative charge is directed along @xmath139 - the projection of the particle velocity onto a plane perpendicular to shower axis - at early times and in the opposite direction later on .",
    "the shape of the pulse maps the variation with depth of the excess charge in the shower .",
    "this information can be of great practical importance for interpreting actual data .    a consistency check performed by fourier - transforming the pulse in time and comparing it to the frequency spectrum obtained directly in the simulations yields , as expected , fully consistent results .",
    "our results , besides testing algorithms used for reference calculations in the frequency domain , shed new light into the properties of the radio pulse in the time domain .    in the future we plan to implement the algorithm for time - domain calculations of electric field pulses in monte carlo simulations of hadronic and neutrino - induced showers , of great importance for neutrino detectors using the radio erenkov technique .",
    "also we will explore how actual experiments can exploit the richness of information contained in the shape in time of the radio pulse to obtain information on the shower development .",
    "this could be of great help in the reconstruction of the parameters of the neutrino - induced showers and to discriminate against background events .",
