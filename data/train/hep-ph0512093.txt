    "neutralinos are mixtures of the spin-1/2 superpartners of the neutral gauge and higgs bosons in supersymmetric extensions to the standard model . the lightest one ( @xmath2 ) is generally considered to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is stable in @xmath1-parity conserving scenarios . signals of supersymmetry ( susy ) are expected to be observable at hadron  @xcite or future @xmath0 colliders  @xcite .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "neutralinos are majorana fermions whose antiparticles are themselves . if susy ( and the associated neutralinos ) is observed in nature , the determination of their properties under @xmath3 conjugation , majorana vs dirac , will be a key issue : it is intimately related to the dimension of susy , e.g. @xmath4 or @xmath5 susy  @xcite .",
    "many studies of the majorana nature of neutralinos have been performed @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite observed that the @xmath3 and @xmath6 properties of the final state determine the majorana nature of neutralinos in the process @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "selectron pair production in @xmath9 scattering , @xmath10 , would also be of great utility , as it could proceed only on account of @xmath11-channel majorana neutralino exchange  @xcite .",
    "in addition , majorana effects in two- or three - body decays of neutralinos are known to exist  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we study the majorana nature of neutralinos in lighter scalar tau ( stau ) pair production and subsequent decay into @xmath12 lepton ( tau ) plus lsp neutralino in @xmath0 annihilation , @xmath13 via the quantum mechanical correlation between two identical neutralinos which exists only if they are majorana fermions .",
    "that a correlation should exist should be evident simply due to proper treatment of the fermi statistics of the final - state neutralinos , but it is always ignored : conventional wisdom says that the correlation between decay products of scalar ( spinless ) particles , such as staus , is absent .",
    "because of this , little attention in the literature has been given to the expected majorana effect , even though the process we consider here is among the most promising to study susy particles and many studies of it have been performed  @xcite for exploration of other aspects .",
    "naturally , no correlation is possible once a spinless particle is separated from the other particles at a macroscopic space - time distance . in other words",
    ", any interference effect disappears in the limit of long lifetime of the spinless particles .",
    "we should hence consider the finite stau width , and investigate the region near pair production threshold .",
    "in addition to the finite width , the left - right mixing of the staus and/or the gaugino - higgsino mixing of the neutralinos are necessary for the correlation to be significant .",
    "this is because in the massless neutralino limit , same - helicity neutralinos are produced only when the taus have the same helicity , which occurs only when the @xmath14-@xmath15 mixing and/or the neutralino mixing are significant .",
    "we will discuss this in detail in the following section , and simply note in passing that significant interference effects are expected in @xmath16 and @xmath17 pair production processes , which quantitative study will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ secmix ] gives a brief introduction of the mass eigenstates of the staus ( @xmath18 ) and the gaugino - higgsino mixing of the neutralinos .",

    "[ secdif ] , we study in detail the kinematical correlations due to identical - particle interference effects and compare them to the dirac ( noninterference ) case .",
    "section [ secsum ] is devoted to a summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce the staus left - right mixing and the neutralinos gaugino - higgsino mixing .",
    "we also give the @xmath19-@xmath12-@xmath2 coupling , where @xmath19 is defined to be the lighter stau mass eigenstate after @xmath21-@xmath1 mixing .    because of the non - negligible tau yukawa coupling , mixing occurs between the weak eigenstates @xmath14 and @xmath15 to form mass eigenstates @xmath19 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) as @xmath24 neutralinos are mass eigenstates of the neutral gauginos , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the neutral higgsinos , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "the mass eigenstates are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 diagonalizes the above mass matrix as @xmath41 here , @xmath42 .",
    "the decay @xmath43 depends on both the left - right stau mixing ( @xmath44 ) and the neutralino mixing ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the @xmath19-@xmath12-@xmath2 coupling can be expressed as @xmath46 with the chiral - projection operators @xmath47 .",

    "the couplings @xmath60 and @xmath61 come from the stau - gaugino interactions , where chirality is conserved .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are proportional to the tau mass , and come from the @xmath64-@xmath12-@xmath65 yukawa coupling , which flips chirality . for further details",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    at this point",
    "it is worth noting that _ either _ the left - right stau mixing _ or _ the gaugino - higgsino mixing of the neutralinos is needed for the majorana interference effects to be significant .",
    "this may be explained as follows : if both mixings are absent , the tau produced in decay is either left - handed ( gaugino interaction ) or right - handed ( higgsino interaction ) , and the @xmath66 is of the opposite chirality .",
    "the two neutralinos then have opposite chirality and their interference vanishes in the massless limit , where helicity coincides with chirality .",

    "therefore the crossed diagram ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ dres ] should be added to diagram ( a ) before the amplitude is squared .",
    "the relative sign between these two diagrams appears due to fermi statistics .",
    "the full amplitude can be expressed as the product of the stau pair production amplitude ( @xmath68 ) , the two breit - wigner propagators for the staus , @xmath69 and two @xmath43 decay amplitudes ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath72 the intermediate stau momenta can be written in terms of the final - state particle momenta : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",

    "here , we neglect the electron mass and take @xmath81 . using the straightforward feynman rules for majorana fermions given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stau decay amplitudes for @xmath82 are written as @xmath83 similarly , for @xmath84 @xmath85 in this article , we assume the lighter stau ( @xmath19 ) to be the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , a common occurrence in many mssm scenarios .",

    "limit , this relation remains even in the @xmath0 cm frame since the spin can not flip due to the boost , i.e. , @xmath110 therefore , in the massless neutralino and tau limit , when @xmath98 and @xmath66 have the same helicity ( @xmath111 ) , the two neutralinos also have the same helicity , and we expect significant interference effects between the two amplitudes , @xmath82 and @xmath84 . on the other hand ,",

    "[ staucei ] , where we consider only the @xmath19 pair production process in the @xmath155 limit .",
    "however , one can also see a difference in the behavior of the interference between fig .",
    "[ allcei ] and fig .",
    "[ staucei ] .",
    "the region of constructive interference becomes larger than that in fig .",
    "[ staucei ] . the reason is given by eq .",
    "( [ ifp2 ] ) : the third term proportional to the neutralino mass squared is additive with the first term , @xmath173 , when we consider a finite neutralino mass .",
    "we can also repeat the kinematical analysis for the majorana case , taking into account a finite neutralino mass .",
    "equation ( [ cosa ] ) is slightly modified by the boost effect as @xmath207 where the two neutralinos have the same four - momentum . on the other hand , the condition that the momenta of @xmath98 and @xmath66 are the same does not change , namely @xmath201 .",
    "this supports the tendency of the interference pattern to increase with finite neutralino mass in fig .",
    "[ allcei ] .",
    "figure [ all2cei ] is the same as fig .",
    "[ allcei ] , but for the @xmath112 case . as we discussed and explicitly showed in eq .",
    "( [ ifd ] ) at the end of sec .",
    "[ sechel ] , one can see the majorana interference effect even for the @xmath112 case .",
    "the distributions for the @xmath111 case are much more useful than those of the @xmath112 case because in ( a ) there is a significant shape change which includes two inflection points , whereas the distribution is monotonic in the latter case ; and because in ( b , c ) the distributions for @xmath111 involve a peak shift , not just a magnitude change as for @xmath112 .    a final question we may ask is , what would be the observability of the majorana interference effect ?",
    "we answer this by calculating the integrated luminosity required at a future linear collider to observe a @xmath208 effect , using the case mssm described above and collisions at @xmath153  gev .",
    "the simplest observable is the @xmath190 distribution of fig .",
    "[ staucei](a ) , which has a small forward - backward asymmetry @xmath209 .",
    "we furthermore make the estimate using the nonphysical enhanced - effect case of @xmath210 .",
    "the formula for the statistical uncertainty on an asymmetry measurement is , @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the number of events with @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) and @xmath215 is the total number of events .",
    "since the asymmetry is small , 0.02 in this case , we may use the approximation @xmath216 . substituting and rearranging , we arrive at a formula for the required luminosity to observe a @xmath208 effect : @xmath217 plugging in @xmath218 and @xmath219  fb",
    ", we arrive at an estimate of 18,750  fb@xmath220 .",
    "one is swift to conclude that even in an enhanced - effect scenario due to abnormally large finite stau width , a future linear collider unfortunately can not observe this effect .",
    "we studied the quantum mechanical correlation between two identical neutralinos , which exists only if they are majorana particles , for the process @xmath20 .",
    "we also considered the single - resonance contributions to the final state .",
    "we found that the correlation between two neutralinos appears near @xmath19 pair production threshold in the presence of a finite stau width and mixing of the staus and/or neutralinos .",
    "we discussed the finite width effect in detail , and found that the correlation effect tends to be proportional to the decay width .",
    "distributions in several kinematical variables , such as @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath168 as defined in sec .",
    "[ secdif ] , show the interference effect , although the effect largely disappears after integrating over these distributions .",
    "because the correlation effects are significant only in a specific kinematical configuration , they can be observed only in models where the neutralino momenta can be kinematically reconstructed , such as in models with @xmath1-parity violation . unfortunately the interference pattern does not persist in the angular distribution of the final - state taus in the lab frame , disallowing these observables to be determined in an @xmath1-parity - conserving mssm scenario .",
    "our brief estimate of the potential observability of the majorana interference effect ( assuming an @xmath1-parity - violating scenario ) using the asymmetry of the stau decay angular distribution in its rest frame is unfortunately not optimistic .",
    "it appears that an unrealistic amount of integrated luminosity at a future @xmath0 collider operating at stau pair threshold would be required .",
    "thus this particular interference effect for stau nlsp pairs remains a pedagogical observation , but a very interesting one nonetheless .    before closing our discussions ,",
    "we point out that a significant interference effect is also expected in @xmath221 and @xmath17 pair production processes .",
    "the quantitative study will be reported elsewhere .",
