    "quantum entanglement [ 1,2 ] is a non - classical correlation shared among quantum systems which could be non - local [ 3,4 ] in some cases .",
    "it is a fundamental trait of quantum mechanics . like classical correlations",
    ", entanglement also decays with time in the presence of noise in the ambient environment .",
    "the decay of entanglement depends on the initial state and the type and amount of noise ( amplitude damping , phase damping , etc . )",
    "acting on the system [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "the entangled states : @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( maximally entangled  bell states  for @xmath2 ) being the simplest and most useful entangled states in quantum information processing receive special attention .",
    "the maximally entangled states @xmath3 and @xmath4 undergo asymptotic decay of entanglement in the presence of an amplitude damping channel ( adc ) .",
    "the non maximally entangled states @xmath4 always undergo asymptotic decay of entanglement , whereas @xmath3 undergo asymptotic decay for @xmath5 and a finite time end called entanglement sudden death ( esd ) for @xmath6 in the presence of adc . on the other hand ,",
    "a pure phase damping channel ( pdc ) causes entanglement to always decay asymptotically .",
    "two different initial states ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ) , which share the same amount of initial entanglement ( measured through negativity ) being affected by the same type of noise may follow very different trajectories of entanglement decay . in the presence of multiple stochastic noises , although the decoherence of individual qubits follows the additive law of relaxation rates , the decay of entanglement , does not .",
    "in fact , entanglement may not decay asymptotically at all , and disentanglement can happen in finite time ( esd ) .",
    "esd has been experimentally demonstrated in atomic [ 8 ] and photonic systems [ 9,10 ] .    since entanglement is a resource in quantum information processing",
    "[ 11 - 13 ] , manipulation that prolongs entanglement will help realize protocols that would otherwise suffer due to short entanglement times . also , entanglement purification [ 14 ] and distillation [ 15 ] schemes could possibly recover the initial correlation from the ensemble of noise - degraded correlation so long as the system has not completely disentangled .",
    "therefore , the delay or avoidance of esd is important .",
    "several proposals exist to suppress the decoherence ; for example , decoherence - free subspaces [ 16 - 19 ] , quantum error correction [ 20,21 ] , dynamical decoupling [ 22 - 24 ] , quantum zeno effect [ 25 - 27 ] , quantum measurement reversal [ 28 - 33 ] , and delayed - choice decoherence suppression [ 34 ] . protecting entanglement using weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal [ 32,33 ] , and delayed choice decoherence suppression [ 34 ] have been experimentally demonstrated . both of these schemes , however , have the limitation that the success probability of decoherence suppression decreases as the strength of the weak interaction increases .    the practical question we want to address here is ; whether , given a two - qubit entangled state in the presence of amplitude damping channel which causes disentanglement in finite time , can we alter the time of disentanglement by a suitable operation during the process of decoherence ? a theoretical proposal exists in the literature for such manipulation of esd [ 35 ] through a local unitary operation ( not operation in computational basis : @xmath9 ) performed on the individual qubits which swaps their population of ground and excited states .",
    "depending on the time of application of this not operation , it can avoid , delay , or hasten the esd . based on this proposal [ 35 ] ,",
    "we have extended the experimental set up [ 9 ] for esd and propose here an all - optical experimental set up for manipulating esd involving the not operation on one or both the qubits of a bipartite entangled state in a photonic system .",
    "the system consists of polarization - entangled photons ( @xmath10 ) produced in the sandwich configuration type - i spdc ( spontaneous parametric down conversion)[38 ] .",
    "these photons are sent to two displaced identical sagnac interferometers , where adc is simulated using rotating hwps ( half wave plates ) placed in the path of incoming photons ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the hwp selectively causes a @xmath11 polarized photon to  decay  to @xmath12 ( @xmath12 and @xmath11 serve as ground and excited states of the system , the two states of a qubit)[9 ] . the not operation is implemented by a hwp with fast axis at @xmath13 relative to @xmath11 , placed right after the adc .",
    "this hwp is followed by pbs ( polarizing beam splitter ) to segregate the @xmath12 and @xmath11 polarizations and , with subsequent adc after the not operation implemented by a set of secondary hwps acting on @xmath11 only .",
    "such a set of secondary hwps simulating the adc ( or evolution of qubits in noisy environment ) is essential to our study as the adc ( for example , spontaneous emission in case of a two - level atomic system ) continues to act even after the not operation is applied [ 35 ] and these secondary hwps simulate it in our proposed experiment .",
    "the orientation of the hwp ( @xmath14 ) plays the role of time ( @xmath15 ) with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) analogous to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) for a two - level atomic system decaying to the ground state due to spontaneous emission .",
    "we use negativity as a measure of entanglement .",
    "it is defined as the sum of absolute values of negative eigen values of the partially transposed density matrix [ 36,37 ] .",
    "we find that our simulation results for the manipulation of esd involving not operations on one or both the qubits of a polarization entangled photonic system in presence of adc are completely consistent with the theoretical predictions of the reference [ 35 ] which has analyzed an atomic system .",
    "the merit of our scheme is that it can delay or avoid esd ( provided the not operation is performed sufficiently early ) unlike previous experiments [ 32 - 34 ] where success probabilities scaled with the strength of the weak interaction . since the photonic system is time independent and noise is simulated using hwps , it gives experimentalists complete freedom to study and manipulate the disentanglement dynamics in a controlled manner .",
    "in this , our photonic system through a controllable hwp offers an advantage over others such as atomic states where the decay occurs through noise sources lying outside experimental control .",
    "the not operation that we apply through a hwp is the analogue of flipping spin in a nuclear magnetic system , achieved through what is referred to as a @xmath20 pulse .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ( 2 ) , we discuss the all - optical implementation of the proposed esd experiment and analyze it theoretically using the kraus operator formalism . in section ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we discuss and theoretically analyze the proposed esd - manipulation experiment involving not operation on both or on only one of the qubits , respectively . in section ( 5 ) , we give analytical expressions for probabilities @xmath21 and also for esd and its manipulation curves in terms of the parameters of the initial state ( density matrix ) .",
    "the first of these is the setting (  time  ) for esd , the next setting for the not marking the border between hastening and delay ; that is , if the not is applied after @xmath22 ( and of course before @xmath23 ) , it actually hastens , esd happening before @xmath23 , whereas application before delays esd to stretch past @xmath23 to larger but still finite value less than one .",
    "the third , @xmath24 , marks the border between delaying or completely avoiding esd . applying the not after @xmath24 delays to a larger @xmath23 value whereas applying before avoids esd altogether . in section ( 6 )",
    ", we summarize the results of manipulation of esd for different pure and mixed initial entangled states , giving numerical values of @xmath25 , and @xmath24 .",
    "section ( 7 ) concludes with pros and cons of the proposed scheme for the manipulation of esd and the future scope of this work .",
    "the proposed experimental setup for esd is shown in figure ( 1 ) , which is a generalization of the scheme used in reference [ 9 ] .",
    "the type-1 polarization entangled photons ( @xmath26 ) can be prepared by standard methods [ 38 ] ; the amplitudes @xmath27 and @xmath28 and relative phase @xmath29 are controlled by the hwp and qwp ( quarter wave plate ) .",
    "these entangled photons are sent to two displaced sagnac interferometers with hwps simulating the adc , where decoherence takes place , and finally these photons are sent for tomographic reconstruction of the quantum state [ 39 ] .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath11 polarizations of the photon serve as the ground and excited states of the analogous atomic system , while output spatial modes of the reservoir @xmath30 serve as the ground and excited states of the reservoir .",
    "asymmetry between degenerate polarization states of a photon ( @xmath31 ) is introduced by the hwp rotation such that it selectively causes an incident @xmath11 polarization to  decay  to @xmath12 , while leaving @xmath12 polarization intact .",
    "thus the @xmath12 and @xmath11 polarization states are analogous to the ground and excited states , respectively , of a two - level atomic system .",

    " decays  to @xmath12 . for different fixed orientations of @xmath34 , evolution in adc",
    "is completed by rotating @xmath35 .",
