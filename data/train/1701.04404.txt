    "the development of the ott - antonsen ansatz initiated a revolution in the coupled oscillator literature @xcite .",
    "the method was first presented as an ansatz which could be used to reduce kuramoto ( and closely related systems ) to a low - dimensional set of macroscopic equations @xcite . remarkably , ott and antonsen were also able to show their procedure captures all the long - time attractors of these systems @xcite .",
    "the fact that this procedure allows for the derivation of strong analytic results has led to its application to a vast array of questions in the coupled oscillator community @xcite .",
    "recently , the ott - antonsen procedure was applied directly to the study of circadian rhythms for the first time @xcite .    while an extremely powerful tool , the ott - antonsen procedure suffers from several limitations .",
    "first , it may only be applied to systems which have a single harmonic in the coupling function describing the interaction between the oscillators @xcite .",
    "secondly , the ansatz is not valid for systems whose oscillators evolve with a stochastic component * ? ? ?",
    "each of these could severely limit its applicability to biological systems : coupling between biological oscillators often features higher harmonic components in the coupling @xcite , and the biological oscillators are invariably noisy @xcite .",
    "the final restriction on the ott - antonsen procedure is one of practicality rather than a formal mathematical restriction . in its most powerful form",
    "the ott - antonsen procedure requires the assumption that the distribution of natural frequencies be given by a rational function @xmath8 , which is typically taken to be a cauchy ( lorentzian ) distribution , @xmath9 } , \\label{eq : cauchy}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the median frequency and @xmath11 controls the strength of the heterogeneity in the oscillator population .",
    "the cauchy distribution decays slowly as @xmath12 giving it `` fat - tails '' , or a significant density of oscillators at extreme frequencies relative to the median @xmath10 .",
    "making the cauchy assumption on the frequency distribution is a crucial step in achieving the dimension reduction to macroscopic variables . for more general frequency distributions , the oa procedure is still mathematically valid , although it produces an infinite set of integro - ordinary differential equations rather than a low - dimensional macroscopic model @xcite .",
    "let us refer to the ott - antonsen procedure with the additional assumption of a cauchy distribution of frequencies as cauchy ott - antonsen ( coa ) .",
    "the coa ansatz takes a particularly simple form when written in terms of the daido order parameters of the phase distribution @xcite .",
    "the daido order parameters are given by , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the phases of the oscillators and @xmath15 the phase coherences and @xmath16 the mean phases .",
    "typically , only the first term is considered @xmath17 and is known as the kuramoto order parameter . here @xmath18 measures the collective amplitude in the population of oscillators with @xmath19 indicating desynchrony and @xmath20 perfect synchrony .",
    "the coa ansatz then becomes a simple geometric relation between the daido order parameters ,    @xmath21    for a phase distribution which is unimodal and symmetric about its mean phase we expect the mean phase relation @xmath22 to hold generally . in this work we will restrict to considering cases where the phase distribution is approximately unimodal and symmetric",
    "however , the prediction that @xmath23 is more subtle and its efficacy has not been evaluated for biological systems .    to test this we computed the daido order parameters for a recently published data set measuring the @xmath24 hour oscillations of protein expression in circadian neurons from whole suprachaismatic nucleus ( scn ) explants @xcite .",
    "we examined this data set for evidence of the coa relation @xmath23 between the daido order parameters fig .  [",

    "however , we find this relationship is distinctly absent from the circadian data set . additionally , numerical simulations of several other models of biological oscillators also reveal the coa approach provides a poor representation of the equilibrium phase distribution fig .",
    "[ fig : oadyngood](b - d ) .",
    "instead we consistently find a different relation , @xmath25 captures the properties of the phase distribution for these systems .",
    "what this means is that , while the ott - antonsen ansatz ( coa ) is a powerful tool for analyzing certain systems of coupled oscillators the diverse systems we test suggest a different scaling .",
    "this alternate scaling may be derived under more general assumptions than those used by ott and antonsen .",
    "let us consider the equilibrium phase distribution @xmath26 describing the states of the @xmath0 oscillators and assume @xmath27 for each oscillator .",
    "then a taylor series expansion of the daido order parameters may be written as , @xmath28 then making use of our assumption that the equilibrium phase distribution is unimodal and symmetric we have that @xmath22 and without loss of generality we may set @xmath29 . introducing the notation , @xmath30 gives ,    @xmath31    which will hold whenever the quantity @xmath32 can be considered small . which justifies the emergence of the @xmath33 ansatz we found in both the experimental and simulated data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oadyngood ] ) .",
    "this analysis begs the question of how the coa relation @xmath23 and our relation can both be true .",
    "the root of the discrepancy is in the fat - tails of the cauchy distribution .",
    "the slow decay in the tails of the cauchy distribution property keeps the quantity @xmath32 large for any finite coupling strength - as the oscillator population contains a significant fraction of oscillators which are not locked in a synchronized cluster .",
    "however , for natural frequency distributions with exponential tails ( e.g. gaussian ) the fraction of locked oscillators grows quickly and we find our ansatz emerges for moderate coupling strengths . our ansatz is compared with the coa ansatz in fig .",
