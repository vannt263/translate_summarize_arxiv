    "the problem of the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies has partly been motivated by the long - standing questions about possible connections and transformations between different types of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the two basic morphological types are : gas - poor dwarf spheroidals with very little present - day star formation , and gas - rich dwarf irregulars ( di s ) and blue compact dwarf galaxies which contain recent bursts of star formation . intrinsic properties ( e.g. , total mass ) and external forces ( e.g. , environment ) all have a role to play , but key processes may be difficult to identify and disentangle ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the study of dwarf galaxies in different environments of varying galaxy number density ( i.e. , field , groups , clusters ) provides valuable insights about the key parameters controlling evolution , and constraints to the various models for galaxy evolution .",
    "the centaurus a ( cen  a ) group is a loose collection of galaxies , and contains a very rich population of galaxies with the largest dispersion in morphological types @xcite .",
    "the average distance of the cen  a group is comparable to that of the m81 group ( cf .",
    "the cen  a group may already be virialized as indicated by the relatively short crossing timescale ( @xmath7 23 gyr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cen  a group is separated into two `` subgroups '' ( * ? ? ? * their fig .",
    "1 ) with one collection of galaxies surrounding ngc  5128 and the other collection surrounding the spiral galaxy m  83 .",
    "the m  83 collection is more compact and contains more late - type galaxies , whereas the ngc  5128 collection is more dispersed and contains fewer late - type galaxies .",
    "the ngc  5128 subgroup has a heliocentric velocity @xmath8 km  s@xmath9 and an average distance @xmath10  mpc .",
    "there are 31 known members , of which ten ( 32% ) are classified as late - type dwarf galaxies ( rc3 morphological  type @xmath11 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the m  83 subgroup has @xmath12 km  s@xmath9 and an average distance @xmath13  mpc .",
    "there are 19 known members , of which 12 ( 63% ) are classified as late - type dwarf galaxies ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the cen  a group is uniquely dominated by ngc  5128 ( centaurus  a ) , which is a large massive radio - loud elliptical galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining massive members in the group all exhibit disturbed morphologies or abnormal properties , suggestive of a recent infall episode in which a population of gas - rich dwarf galaxies has been accreted into the group ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is precisely the scenario presented by @xcite , who discovered a long , thin , blue arc in the northeast halo of ngc  5128 .",
    "this feature is thought to have once been a low - mass di which fell into the halo of the elliptical and is undergoing tidal disruption .",
    "this may also help explain why there are relatively few di s in the vicinity of ngc  5128 , compared to m  83 @xcite .",
    "additional studies of dwarf galaxies in the cen  a group have been carried out in  ( s. ct et al .",
    ", in prep . ) and in  ( @xcite ) to examine the total and spatial distribution of gas and recent star - formation .",
    "@xcite studied the red giant stellar populations in two cen  a dwarf elliptical galaxies , and found the fraction of intermediate - age stars to all stars is smaller than that found in local group dwarf ellipticals .",
    "@xcite identified 13 new dwarf elliptical galaxies , and confirmed the membership of two dwarf irregular galaxies in the group .",
    "they also identified am  1318@xmath0444 and eso  381@xmath0g018 as two new dwarf irregulars in the cen  a group .",
    "@xcite examined three gas - rich dwarf spheroidals with old ( @xmath14 gyr ) stellar populations , and showed that the relatively high gas content could be explained by the low level of past star formation .",
    "oxygen abundances are a reliable measure of the present - day gas - phase metallicity within  regions in gas - rich star - forming dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , they provide useful constraints as the most recent and maximum metallicity to anchor the star - formation history . @xcite and @xcite obtained oxygen abundances for southern irregular and spiral galaxies , including galaxies in the cen  a group and in the field , with a measured range of abundances from about ten to sixty per cent of the solar value .",
    "although these papers have been , until recently , the primary work regarding abundances in cen  a late - type dwarf galaxies , the spectra were obtained with inherently non - linear detectors . in many cases ,",
    "the character of the non - linearities were not understood until after publication ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; subsequent corrections for non - linearity were not possible .    for a comparison of gas - phase abundances",
    "with published work on nearby dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we undertook a program of determining new and confirming previous nebular oxygen abundances for gas - rich dwarf galaxies in the local volume @xcite , which would help answer the question about whether recent chemical enrichment is sensitive to the ( group ) environment . here , we present spectra of 35  regions in eight cen  a di s , as well as spectra of 13  regions in three additional nearby dwarf galaxies .",

[ fig_diags]b  d , we have plotted the -gas - to-@xmath69-light ratio and parameters related to gas fraction against oxygen abundance . in the absence of measured optical colours for cen  a and scl di s to derive color - based stellar mass - to - light ratios described by @xcite , we compute stellar masses by simply assuming a constant stellar mass - to-@xmath69-light ratio equal to one . our adopted value is within the range of stellar mass - to-@xmath69-light ratios derived by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we compute total gas mass as @xmath102 = 1.36 @xmath103 , which includes helium , but ignores molecular gas . under the assumption of closed - box evolution ,",
    "we have also plotted various curves with yields varying by a factor of five .",
    "we find that nearby di s @xcite and ugc di s @xcite span the range of yields shown . by inspection",
    ", @xmath104 @xmath88 @xmath105 is a good description of the data shown , in general agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two cen  a di s with direct abundances and low gas fractions are eso  272@xmath0g025 and eso  383@xmath0g087 .",
    "generally , cen  a di s span the range of yields shown , whereas the small number of scl di s tend to cluster around the lower end of the yield range .",
    "however , these results are not definitive because of small - number statistics , and measurements of additional galaxies could strengthen possible differences in gas fractions between the two sets of di s .          to explore further the effects of group environments on the properties of gas - rich dwarf galaxies , we examine various properties against tidal index and projected distance ; the latter two parameters are defined and compiled in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , the tidal index of a galaxy is the maximum value of an enhancement in mass density caused by all neighbouring galaxies .",
    "objects with negative tidal indices are isolated in the field , and objects with positive tidal indices are found within group environments , and are likely undergoing a tidal interaction . within each group , the projected distance of a galaxy , @xmath106 , is given by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the distance of the main ( or primary ) group member to the milky way , and @xmath109 is the angular distance ( in degrees ) of the galaxy to the main member .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_ztidal ] , we have plotted various parameters against the tidal index and the projected distance of galaxies within each group . on the left side , we have plotted oxygen abundance ,  gas - to - light fraction , and the  surface mass density as a function of tidal index in panels a , b , and c , respectively . values for the  surface mass density were obtained from @xcite . we have compared cen  a and scl group dwarfs against other dwarfs ( as in fig .  [ fig_diags ] ) , ngc  1705 , and ddo  154 .",
    "there are no obvious trends in the first two panels .",
    "we noted above that eso  272@xmath0g025 and eso  383@xmath0g087 appeared to have low gas fractions for their oxygen abundances , compared to other dwarfs .",
    "both have negative tidal indices , which indicate only that there is no strong present - day tidal interactions . in panel c",
    ", the  surface mass density appears to decrease with increasing positive tidal index , which is expected as strong tidal interactions remove gas from galaxies .",
    "we note that eso  272@xmath0g025 ( cen  a di ) has an unusually low   surface mass density for its tidal index ( @xmath110 , log @xmath111 @xmath88 6 ) .",
    "this suggests that this dwarf may have encountered a strong interaction , which has reduced its  content and has induced present - day star formation ( i.e. , presence of  regions ) .",
    "detailed spatially - resolved observations would be very timely to confirm this scenario .    in figs .",
    "[ fig_ztidal]d  g , we have plotted luminosity , -gas - to - light fraction , oxygen abundance , and the effective yield as a function of the projected distance , respectively .",
    "we have separated dwarfs in different groups by color : local group ( milky way @xmath1 m31 ) in blue , m81 group dwarfs in brown , ic342 @xmath1 maffei group dwarfs in dark green , and cvni group dwarfs in black .",
    "once more , there are no obvious trends ; there is large scatter present in the plots of oxygen abundance and yield versus distance .",
    "naturally , more data are required for examination and for improved statistics in an intergroup comparison .",
    "we note that eso  381@xmath0g020 exhibits an unusually high effective yield for its projected distance ( @xmath88 0.9  mpc ) , although the di does not appear to have any other unusual properties .",
    "although a number of cen  a dwarfs in our sample have positive tidal indices , there is little to separate these galaxies from those with negative tidal indices in the luminosity - metallicity , metallicity - gas fraction , and metallicity - tidal index diagrams .",
    "there is also no clear trend between the current chemical enrichment ( as represented by either oxygen abundance or yield ) with the projected distance of galaxies within each group .",
    "because of low - number statistics , it is difficult to say at the present time whether any separation of cen  a dwarfs and scl dwarfs in these diagnostics is meaningful .",
    "results of optical spectroscopy of  regions from eight dwarf galaxies in the centaurus  a group are presented . for eso272@xmath0g025 and eso324@xmath0g024 , direct oxygen abundances of 12@xmath1log(o / h )",
    "= @xmath2 and @xmath3 are derived , respectively .",
    "bright - line abundances for the remaining galaxies are derived with the mcgaugh and the pilyugin calibrations .",
    "we have also considered data for additional cen  a di s and sculptor group di s from the literature . for their galaxy luminosities , we have found that direct or oxygen abundances agree well with the luminosity - metallicity relationship for dwarf irregular galaxies . despite large tidal indices for a number of cen  a dwarf galaxies , there is no difference between galaxies with positive tidal indices galaxies with negative tidal indices in the luminosity - metallicity , metallicity - gas fraction , and metallicity - tidal index diagrams .",
    "as expected in strong tidal interactions , the  surface mass density appears to decrease with increasing positive tidal index .",
    "we have also examined global properties of dwarf galaxies based on their intragroup properties .",
    "there are no obvious trends in plots of luminosity , hi - to-@xmath69-light ratio , oxygen abundance , and yield against projected distance of galaxies within nearby groups .",
    "we also report spectra and abundances for three nearby dwarf irregular galaxies : ddo  47 , ngc  3109 , and sextans  b. our direct oxygen abundance ( @xmath4 ) for ddo  47 agrees with the measurement previously reported by @xcite . for sextans",
