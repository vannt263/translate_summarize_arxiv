    "in a quark model description of the @xmath9 annihilation process , one usually seeks guidance from feynman diagrams in order to deduce appropriate transition operators ( _ i.e. _ the operators linking the initial @xmath9 quarks and antiquarks so they form the right @xmath25 pairs ) . these so - called quark - line diagrams ( qld )",
    "are classified according to their flavor - flux topology into rearrangement or annihilation diagrams . in the former case a @xmath25 pair",
    "is annihilated and a quark and antiquark are rearranged to produce the final mesons , while in the latter case two @xmath25 pairs are annihilated and an @xmath25 state is created in the final state .",
    "the @xmath25 pairs annihilate into states with distinct quantum numbers @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in a way",
    ", one can conceive of the model as an expansion of the annihilation amplitude in terms of increasing total angular momentum @xmath26 .",
    "parity requires the @xmath25 pairs be annihilated / created in an @xmath28 state . thus the spin - multiplicity is fixed and for @xmath29 one gets @xmath30 , @xmath31 ... annihilation operators . for a concise review of the qld see , for instance , ref .",
    "the resulting transition operators may be written in a hamiltonian form for both the @xmath32 and @xmath33 cases as @xmath34\\,\\times   \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\times\\ ; ( 2\\pi)^3 \\delta ( \\mathbf{k}'-\\mathbf{k}-{{\\mathbf p}}'-{{\\mathbf p } } ) + \\mathrm{h.c . } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where color indices have been suppressed and @xmath35 sums over flavor states .",
    "the delta - function imposes momentum transfer from the annihilated @xmath25 pair to one of the remaining ( anti)quarks . additionally , color is exchanged in the @xmath33 mechanism since @xmath36 is the quantum number of the gluon .",
    "the relative strength @xmath37 is a fit parameter .",
    "confinement is simulated in a harmonic oscillator basis . the single ( anti)quark wavefunctions are therefore bundled in gaussian wave packets in which the c.m .",
    "motion of the ( anti)proton and pions can be separated from the relative motion of their respective quarks and antiquarks .",

    "the size parameter @xmath44 is chosen so as to give the pion a radius @xmath45  fm .",
    "so far , we have dealt with the wave representation of the pion in its rest frame where it is spherical ( meson in an @xmath46-wave ) . in @xmath3 , on the other hand , the pions are produced at considerable c.m .",
    "energies already at very low @xmath15-beam energies ( @xmath47  gev in ref .",
    "the large mass difference between the pion and the proton causes the final state to be highly relativistic , as can be simply seen from the relativistic factor @xmath48 . in computing the annihilation amplitudes ( and observables ) , one puts oneself in the c.m .",

    "therefore , _ all _ ingredients must be transformed to the c.m .",

    "( [ pion ] ) can not be used as such and instead the general lorentz transformation @xmath49 ( where @xmath39 is a quark momentum in the pion rest frame ) yields @xmath50\\!\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat q_\\pi}\\right ) ^{\\!2}\\big ] \\big\\ } .",
    "\\label{expboost}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the exponent , the momentum components along the boost direction @xmath51 have been separated from the perpendicular ones .",
    "naturally , for @xmath52 one retrieves the original wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ pion ] ) .",
    "the additional factor @xmath53 is due to proper normalization to one of the wavefunction .",
    "the lorentz transformations are effected on the dirac spinors via the wick rotations @xmath54 in spin space , where the wick angle @xmath55 depends on the relativistic factor @xmath56 rather than on @xmath57 .",
    "the indices @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the ( anti)quark helicities in the pion rest frame and in the c.m .",
    "frame , respectively .",
    "we have applied the c.m .",
    "equal - time condition @xmath60 for the time components of the quark and antiquark , which is also frequently used in bethe - salpeter approaches .",
    "the effect of the time components is currently under investigation . while the boosting of spinors gives rise to subtle interference effects in the annihilation amplitudes ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , its magnitude is negligible compared with the @xmath57-components . once the wavefunctions of eq .",
    "( [ expboost ] ) are employed to derive the annihilation amplitudes , it becomes clear that the boost effects are dramatic . in summary , the annihilation amplitudes , being of gaussian form ,",
    "acquire new relativistic terms .",
    "their magnitude can be , depending on the @xmath57 ( and hence @xmath61 ) value , up to two orders of magnitude larger than the one of non - relativistic terms .",
    "furthermore , this strong @xmath57-dependence is not constant .",
    "the boosts also introduce an angular dependence by means of the projection on the boost direction @xmath62 in the exponential .",
    "it is this dependence ( which at the hadronic level equates to the c.m .",
    "angle between the antiproton beam and an outgoing pion ) that is novel and crucial to any improvement in a fit to the lear data .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "in the following , we propose a somewhat different geometric interpretation .",
    "the strong modification of both the @xmath32 and @xmath33 annihilation amplitudes is entirely due to the lorentz contractions in the pions . in the overlap",
    "integrals this implies a narrowed overlap of the initial @xmath9 pair and the final pion wave functions . at first sight , this looks discouraging since our introductory discussion revolved around how to increase the annihilation range in a quark model . yet , this decrease in overlap is merely one piece of the puzzle . the other part is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where tentatively the angle dependence of the amplitudes due to relativistic effects is shown for two cases .",
    "the smaller blobs represent the pions and are round for @xmath52 and oval ( lorentz contracted ) otherwise",
    ". the distances between the two pions and the proton and antiproton are the same in each picture . however ,",
    "in the first case the pions are produced perpendicularly to the @xmath15 beam direction and all particles overlap .",
    "they do so somewhat less when the pions are contracted . in the second case , where the pions are emitted at a different angle , the four spheres overlap if relativity is neglected while the two pion - ellipsoids overlap much less with the the @xmath9 spheres if relativity is included .",
    "this angle - dependent overlap is responsible for a richer angular dependence of the annihilation amplitudes .",
    "we therefore obtain significant contributions to @xmath10 partial waves not present previously and a fit to the lear data  @xcite is quite successful  @xcite . on the other hand , it is clear that one can not define an annihilation range _ per se _ since this range depends on the pion direction with respect to the initial @xmath15-beam .",
    "even so , one can conclude that in order for the @xmath9 pair to annihilate , the quarks and antiquarks must have a considerable overlap whose size is less than two nucleon radii .",

    "<S> we present a geometric interpretation of the so - called annihilation range in reactions of the type @xmath0 _ two light mesons _ based upon lorentz effects in the highly relativistic final states ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> lorentz - boosted meson wave functions , within the framework of the constituent quark model , result in a richer angular dependence of the annihilation amplitudes and thus in higher partial wave contributions ( @xmath2 ) than usually obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this approach sheds some light on what could be a `` _ short _ '' annihilation range and how it is influenced by the angular distribution of the final states .     </S>",

    "<S> @xcite while focusing on the details of lorentz effects in reactions of the type @xmath3 or @xmath4 when the final states are highly energetic . </S>",
    "<S> the initial motivation is twofold : for one , a long - standing debate about the antiproton - proton range exists in which proponents of a _ very _ short annihilation range , of the order of the compton wavelength of the annihilating baryons ( @xmath5  fm ) , emphasize the role of analytical properties of feynman graphs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this should be _ a priori _ the range of baryon exchange in the @xmath6-channel .    </S>",
    "<S> comparison of baryon exchange model results @xcite with @xmath3 and @xmath4 data on differential cross sections @xmath7 and analyzing powers @xmath8 , as measured in the pre - lear experiments at cern and kek  @xcite as well as at lear  @xcite , nonetheless clearly indicates that these models are too short ranged . </S>",
    "<S> they give vanishing total @xmath9 angular momentum @xmath10 contributions to the annihilation amplitudes , whereas partial wave analyzes @xcite of both the pre - lear  @xcite and lear  @xcite data consistently point to higher partial wave amplitudes with @xmath11 up to 3 or 4 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , compared with elastic proton - proton scattering , where partial waves up to @xmath12 are necessary to fit the data , antiproton - proton annihilation is a short - range interaction . yet , the experiments mentioned above seem not to confirm the _ extreme _ shortness implied by the baryon exchange models . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to note that the annihilation range is not merely given by the compton wavelength of the baryons alone . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the annihilation vertices are regularized with appropriate form factors , which smear out the baryon - meson interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the case of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the form factor of the pseudovector pion - proton coupling is found to improve the fits to @xmath3 cross sections and analyzing powers . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore not advisable to ascribe the annihilation range solely to heavy baryon exchange in the @xmath6-channel .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of alternative geometric arguments , such as the minimal overlap for annihilation of an @xmath9 pair within a quark picture motivated by bag models , was investigated by alberg _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in their fit </S>",
    "<S> to @xmath9 scattering data the effective nucleon bag radius @xmath13 takes on values of @xmath14  fm . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial assumption is that @xmath9 annihilation proceeds only when the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bags overlap so the quarks and antiquarks can rearrange or annihilate to form the observed mesons . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the annihilation is found to peak at @xmath17  fm or @xmath18  fm depending on the bag - model form used . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in geometric terms the annihilation range is roughly twice the nucleon radius which is much larger than the compton wavelength of the nucleon . if one uses a chiral bag model then the pressure of the mesonic cloud about the core quarks decreases the nucleon bag radius . since the external mesons are not believed to participate in the @xmath9 annihilation , the upper bound for the annihilation range is somewhat lowered . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , quark model calculations also fail to reproduce the lear data @xcite as they too are rather short - ranged . </S>",
    "<S> the range , in this case , is an intrinsic property of overlap integrals involving ( anti)quark wavefunctions with size parameters that reproduce the particle radii known from fits as the one just mentioned  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> yet another approach to define an annihilation range is due to povh and walcher  @xcite and was subsequently applied by the bonn group  @xcite to the bonn and paris @xmath19 potentials . in a nutshell , </S>",
    "<S> the method consists of taking the quantity @xmath20 as the annihilation probability for a partial wave of angular momentum @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the radial component of the ( bonn or paris ) @xmath19 wavefunction and @xmath23 the imaginary part of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> plotting @xmath24 for several partial waves , they found for the paris @xmath19 potential a maximum localized at about 0.5  fm and for the bonn @xmath19 potential this value is about 1.1  fm . </S>",
    "<S> this range compares well with the quark model prediction discussed in the previous paragraph .    </S>",
    "<S> the second motivation stems from the observation that the hasan _ et al . _ lear data  @xcite reveals a strong left - right asymmetry with respect to the beam direction and displays large variations of the cross sections as a function of the c.m </S>",
    "<S> . angle . in our work </S>",
    "<S> , we try to determine how relativistic effects , namely lorentz contractions in quark - model wavefunctions , influence the annihilation amplitudes and whether these effects are relevant to the annihilation range . </S>"
