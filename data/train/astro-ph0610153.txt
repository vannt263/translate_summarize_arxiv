    "simulations of structure formation have become well - refined and sophisticated over the past few decades . typically , n - body simulations follow collisionless particles that represent dark matter and hierarchically form gravitationally bound structures .",
    "these structures have several `` universal '' characteristics , among them their self - similar density profiles ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , as of yet there is no accepted physical mechanism for explaining these shared properties , although there is no lack of hypotheses ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this work further examines the recently advanced suggestion that nonextensive thermodynamics can be used to determine the equilibria @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we deal only with spherically symmetric systems in this work .",
    "the lack of short - range forces in self - gravitating , collisionless systems throws the adoption of standard thermodynamics into question .",
    "instead , @xcite has proposed a generalized themodynamical approach for such systems based on the nonextensiveness of entropy ; _ i.e. , _  the entropy of a composite system is not simply the sum of the subsystems entropies . in particular ,",
    "the entropy of a composite system is given by , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the entropy , @xmath3 and @xmath4 refer to subsystems , and @xmath5 is a parameter that describes the degree of nonextensiveness . when @xmath6 the situation is extensive and corresponds to standard thermodynamics .",
    "nonextensive thermodynamics ( sometimes referred to as @xmath5-statistics ) has been designed to describe systems with long dynamical memories , as in self - gravitating collisionless objects .",
    "although other applications have been discussed by @xcite , specific applications of nonextensive thermodynamics to astrophysical situations have been discussed by @xcite , and most recently by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter klk ) .",
    "one of the more interesting results of the nonextensive approach is that the associated distribution function has the same form as for a polytrope @xcite . in this case , the analogue to the polytropic index is related to the @xmath5 value ( see   [ constk ] ) .",
    "@xcite appeal to nonextensive thermodynamics to interpret the correlation between density profile slope and velocity anisotropy observed in n - body simulations .",
    "klk have found that the density profiles corresponding to nonextensive distribution functions can be found to match those of virialized dark matter halos formed in cosmological simulations .",
    "these studies have demonstrated that nonextensive thermodynamics is an attractive option for theoretically grounding the behavior seen in computer simulations . after a brief synopsis of relevant halo properties",
    ", we will discuss our findings that nonextensive thermodynamics , as it currently stands , does not provide such a basis .",
    "the virialized structures ( halos ) that are formed in cosmological n - body simulations have several properties that appear to be `` universal '' .",
    "density profiles have nonpower law shapes where a scalelength divides a steeply declining outer region from a less steeply declining inner cusp .",
    "most previous works investigating halo formation focus on explaining this kind of density profile . however , the velocity structures of the halos are also important .",
    "like the density profiles , n - body halo velocity dispersion distributions @xmath7 have nonpower law shapes which peak near the density scalelength .",
    "the relevance of @xmath0  can be illustrated by the quantity @xmath8 which is reminiscent of and shares the dimensionality of the phase space density .",
    "as first noted in @xcite , this quantity follows a power law distribution with radius @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a constant that depends on the particular density profile .",
    "this behavior appears to be linked to the physics of collisionless collapse , given that the same power laws result from independent semi - analytical halo formation models , as shown by @xcite .",
    "the velocity structures of dark matter halos therefore provide additional leverage for understanding the physical mechanisms that drive equilibrium halo formation .",
    "klk demonstrate that the equilibrium density profiles of sufficiently nonextensive systems with velocity isotropy describe the results of n - body simulations well ( see figure 2 of klk ) .",
    "their work maintains a constant degree of nonextensiveness @xmath5 . to maintain continuity with klk",
    ", we will adopt their variable @xmath11 as the measure of nonextensiveness .",
    "we first investigate the predicted velocity dispersion for these models , and then we proceed to allow @xmath12 to vary .      starting with the nonextensive definition of entropy @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant and the sum is over all accessible states ( each with probability @xmath16 ) , one can extremize @xmath17 under the constraints of constant total mass and energy to find the distribution function , as in @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the same nonextensive velocity distribution functions can be found using a variation on maxwell s derivation of the standard distribution functions , independent of any assumptions about energy .",
    "as @xcite make clear , the nonextensive approach demands velocity isotropy .    assuming a spherical system and adopting the poisson equation as the link between density and potential , the nonextensive distribution function is obtained @xcite , @xmath18^{-\\kappa},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the relative specific energy",
    ", @xmath20 is the specific kinetic energy , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the specific potential energy and @xmath23 is a constant ) , and @xmath24 is an energy normalization constant .",
    "the ` @xmath25 ' denotes that @xmath13 can be positive or negative and the normalization constant @xmath4 reflects that choice .",
    "again , note that this distribution function is exactly that for a polytrope @xcite .",
    "the nonextensive thermodynamic framework provides a physical meaning to the polytropic index ; it is a measure of nonextensiveness . with this distribution function [ which is isotropic since @xmath26",
    ", it can be shown that the density is , @xmath27^{3/2-\\kappa}\\ ] ] and the rms velocity distribution is given by , @xmath28^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 .",
    "we note that equation  [ vdisp ] is reminiscent of the expression for the outer halo velocity dispersion given in equation 3 of @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that these functions satisfy the jeans equation for mechanical equilibrium .",
    "equation  [ dens ] can be solved for @xmath30 and combined with the poisson equation , @xmath31 to form a second - order differential equation for @xmath32 that we solve numerically .",
    "we turn our attention here to the velocity profiles given by equation  [ dens ] .",
    "we will specifically consider profiles with @xmath33 , like those discussed in klk , for reasons discussed at the end of   [ varyk ] . for large values of @xmath34 (",
    "_ i.e. , _  as a system becomes increasingly extensive ) , @xmath0  approaches a constant as the density profile becomes isothermal , as expected . for more modest values of @xmath33 , @xmath0  is always a continuously decreasing function of radius .",
    "however , this is not what is seen in the results of cosmological n - body simulations , for which @xmath0  has a well defined peak near the scalelength of the halo density profile @xmath35 .",
    "another view of this discrepancy is given by the phase - space density - like quantity @xmath8 .",
    "the solid red lines in figure  [ ckpsd ] represent nonextensive density ( panel a ) , velocity dispersion ( panel b ) , and @xmath8  profiles ( panel c ) using the klk values @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 .",
    "note that the density and @xmath8  distributions have been scaled by @xmath38 to highlight differences from this power law profile .",
    "figure  [ ckpsd ] also shows @xmath32 , @xmath0 , and @xmath8profiles for isotropic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) ( dashed blue lines ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n04 ) ( dash - dotted green lines ) models for comparison . in the end , although a nonextensive , constant @xmath13 density profile can be found to mimic the density profiles found in cosmological simulations , the corresponding velocity structures do not match .",
    "we now relax the constraint of constant @xmath13 and allow for @xmath12 distributions .",
    "as before , jeans equilibrium is maintained .",
    "varying @xmath13 introduces derivatives of @xmath13 to equation  [ poisson ] , in addition to the derivatives of @xmath32 , allowing us to choose either : a ) a @xmath32 distribution and solve for @xmath12 , or b ) a @xmath13 distribution and solve for @xmath39 .",
    "we have tested our numerical implementations of these approaches for self - consistency .",
    "accounting for radial variations of @xmath13 is especially pertinent given that it has recently been found that there is a direct connection between @xmath13 ( or @xmath5 ) and the slope of a density profile @xcite .",
    "the radial changes in density slope present in dark matter halo models ( _ e.g. , _  density slopes change from -1 to -3 as radius increases in nfw profiles ) then demand radial variation of @xmath13",
    ".    following track a dicussed above , both nfw and n04 density profiles lead to derived @xmath13 distributions that are always negative . while we discuss the n04 profile in detail here , the nfw results are essentially the same",
    ". figure  [ vksig ] shows the scaled n04 density profile ( panel a ) , three @xmath13 profiles ( panel b ) , and the resulting @xmath0  distributions ( panel c ) .",
    "the solid blue , dashed green , and dash - dotted red lines represent solutions when @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we could not find solutions with positive @xmath13 values over any section of the distribution .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 distributions have roughly sinusoidal shapes superimposed on linear trends which vary with the adopted initial @xmath13 value ; for @xmath42 the linear trends have negative slopes , for @xmath43 the trends are positive .",
    "while these profiles are interesting in their own right , the relevance to the current work is that the resulting velocity dispersion profiles in figure  [ vksig]c remain monotonically decreasing functions , like the constant @xmath13 case ( solid line in figure  [ ckpsd]b ) .",
    "we conclude that the nonextensive distribution given in equation  [ distf ] does not reproduce all aspects of n - body simulation results .    as track",
    "a fails to produce velocity dispersions similar to those in simulations , we now discuss a @xmath13 distribution designed to remedy this problem .",
    "we seek a function that is positive ( negative ) for radii smaller ( larger ) than @xmath35 .",
    "this should give us a dispersion profile that peaks near @xmath35 . since @xmath44 leads to infinite entropy",
    ", we can not simply transition from positive to negative values .",
    "these arguments have led us to choose the following form , @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 as @xmath47 , @xmath48 as @xmath49 , and @xmath50 determines the rate of change between @xmath3 and the infinite value at @xmath51 .",
    "as many functions can be created with similar properties , we discuss this specific form only as an illustrative example .    the @xmath13 profile described by equation  [ cothk ]",
    "is shown in figure  [ vkpsd]a . where @xmath33 , we plot @xmath52 .",
    "a density profile that reasonably approximates those from simulations has the following parameter values ; @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath37 ( figure  [ vkpsd]b ) . as in figure",
    "[ ckpsd ] , the solid red , dashed blue , and dash - dotted green lines represent solution , nfw , and n04 profiles , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0  distribution now has the correct qualitative behavior ; it is a rising function near the center and decreases with increasing @xmath55 ( figure  [ vkpsd]c ) .",
    "however , it does not quantitatively match simulation results . specifically , the @xmath0  profile is too flat .",
    "this difference is also apparent when looking at the @xmath8  distributions in figure  [ vkpsd]d .",
    "the @xmath8profile from the nonextensive approach closely resembles the density , which has a decidedly nonpower law shape .",
    "there simply is not enough variation in the @xmath0  distribution to compensate the changes in @xmath32 and produce a power law .",
    "such discrepancies may reflect the insufficiency of equation  [ cothk ] ; further work may suggest more appropriate @xmath12 expressions .",
    "we note that this use of @xmath56 for @xmath57 contradicts the arguments made in klk and @xcite .",
    "@xcite points out that negative @xmath13 means : 1 ) that the entropy of a composite system is less than in the extensive case , and 2 ) the heat capacity is negative .",
    "@xmath58 implies a positive heat capacity , indicitive of a system in which self - gravity is not important .",
    "we do not speculate further on the implications of this interpretation .",
    "positive @xmath13 has been adopted simply to get the @xmath0  profile to have positive slope at small @xmath59 like the simulation results .",
    "it has been recently shown that nonextensive thermodynamics can be used to explain the density profiles of collisionless dark matter halos formed in cosmological n - body simulations ( * ? ? ? * klk ) . while this is an important step forward in understanding the physics governing collisionless equilibria",
    ", n - body simulations also find universal links between density and velocity distributions , such as the power law behavior of @xmath8  ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "can nonextensive thermodynamics correctly predict the velocity behavior of systems formed in cosmological simulations ?",
    "we find that a constant nonextensiveness parameter @xmath13 ( as in klk ) predicts a velocity dispersion profile that is a continuously decreasing function of radius , in conflict with simulated profiles .",
    "we have extended the klk approach to include radially varying @xmath13 distributions designed to more closely match the velocity behavior of simulation results .",
    "while this approach produces qualitative matches between the predictions and simulation results , there is no quantitative agreement .",
    "we describe four possible solutions to this problem .",
    "\\1 ) equations  [ ent ] and [ tsalent ] correctly describe long - range collisionless gravitational interactions , but cosmological n - body simulations are not purely collisionless close to centers of halos due to numerical effects . in this case , a velocity dispersion that increases with radius ( for @xmath60 ) may indicate that artificial processes that mimic short - range interactions might be at play in the simulations .",
    "we do not speculate on what these might be ( but see * ? ? ? * ) or why they would lead to velocity dispersions increasing with radius .",
    "however , halos calculated from semi - analytical collapse models can reproduce both the density and velocity profiles of n - body halos , arguing against numerical effects .",
    "\\2 ) the nonextensive approach of equations  [ ent ] and [ tsalent ] correctly predicts the global ( asymptotic ) equilibrium state , but n - body simulations ( and possibly , real dark matter halos ) settle to nonlocal or quasi - equilibria through instabilities , such as the radial orbit instability @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) equations  [ ent ] and [ tsalent ] do not correctly describe collisionless systems with long - range interactions , so a different thermodynamic approach needs to be found to describe dark matter halo simulations .",
    "\\4 ) the approach taken in klk and here does not account for velocity anisotropy which is present in halos formed in cosmological n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "preliminary work by the authors that incorporates anisotropy into the nonextensive framework suggests that this is not a panacea .",
    "this adds to the evidence presented in @xcite that suggests the presence of anisotropy in n - body halos requires that the distribution function have a more complex form than that given by equation  [ distf ] , pointing strongly towards the idea that a different thermodynamic approach must be taken for these systems ( point 3 above ) .",
    "regardless of the validity of these points , further investigation of the relationship between nonextensive thermodynamics and self - gravitating systems is vital to providing a physical understanding , and independent corroboration , of the results of dark matter halo formation simulations .",
