    "so far in the literature , the study of null orbits has been restricted to isometries only .",
    "the groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 , on @xmath3 have at least one subgroup @xmath4 which may act on @xmath3 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath4 on @xmath6 , one obtains special cases of the lrs models , @xmath1 admitting either a group @xmath4 on @xmath3 or a null killing vector @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath4 on @xmath5 was studied by barnes @xcite , the group @xmath4 is then of bianchi type @xmath7 and perfect fluid solutions are excluded since the metric leads to a ricci tensor whose segre type is not that of a perfect fluid .",
    "another case that has been considered in the literature is that of a @xmath4 on @xmath3 , such case is subject to the condition @xmath8 and this condition excludes perfect fluids with @xmath9 .",
    "perfect fluid solutions can not admit a non - twisting @xmath10 null killing vector except if @xmath11 . the algebraically special perfect fluid solutions with twisting",
    "null killing vectors are treated by wainwright @xcite and they admit an abelian group @xmath12",
    ".    this paper will deal with space - times admitting a 3-dimensional lie group of conformal motions @xmath0 acting on null orbits . in the beginning",
    "one could get the feeling that this kind of space - times would be empty for perfect fluid solutions , since the line element of these space - times is , by the theorem of defrise - carter @xcite , conformally related to one admitting a @xmath4 acting on null orbits and these ones , as we have pointed out above , do not admit perfect fluid solutions .",
    "but , as we will show , this is not the case , since indeed a conformal scaling does change the ricci tensor , but there are just a few solutions .",
    "we shall concern ourselves with space - times @xmath13 that admit a three - parameter conformal group @xmath0 containing an abelian two - parameter subgroup of isometries @xmath12 , whose orbits @xmath6 are spacelike , diffeomorphic to @xmath14 and admit orthogonal two - surfaces ; furthermore , we shall assume that the @xmath0 acts transitively on null orbits @xmath3 .",
    "the classification of all possible lie algebra structures for @xmath15 under the previous hypothesis was given in @xcite where coordinates were adapted so that the line element associated with the metric @xmath16 can be written as @xcite ds^2=e^2f\\{-dt^2+dr^2+q[h^-1(dy+wdz)^2+hdz^2 ] }  , [ n6 ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are all functions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 alone .",
    "if the conformal algebra @xmath15 belongs to the family ( a ) , it was shown in @xcite that , for null conformal orbits , one can always bring @xmath23 to the form x=_t+_r+x^y(y , z)_y+x^z(y , z)_z  , [ n2 ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are linear functions of their arguments to be determined from the commutation relations of @xmath23 with the killing vectors .",
    "specializing now the conformal equations to the ckv ( [ n2 ] ) and the metric ( [ n6 ] ) , for each possible case , one has the following forms for @xmath23 and the metric functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 appearing in ( [ n6 ] ) ( i ) & & q = q(t - r ) , h = h(t - r ) , w= w(t - r ) , + & & x=_t+_r .",

    "[ n18]in all of these cases @xmath26 and the conformal factor @xmath27 is given by = f_,t+f_,r   .",
    "furthermore one can prove that family ( b ) can not admit conformal killing vectors acting on null orbits ( the proof can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "note that these results are completely independent of the einstein field equations and therefore of the assumed energy - momentum tensor .",
    "for perfect fluid solutions the study is exhausted . for a maximal @xmath0 , with a proper ckv ,",
    "all possible solutions have been found ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "they correspond only to the types @xmath28 and @xmath29 , although none of them satisfies the weak and dominant energy conditions over the whole space - time manifold .",
    "we make the coordinate transformation @xmath31 and @xmath32 , so that we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the field equations yield w=0  , f = f(x)+121+p 1-ph -12 q  , xu-21-ph  , [ n60 ] 0=\\ { q_,vh_,v qh+h_,vvh}_0 + ( h_,vh)^2_1  , [ n61 ] where _ 0&&-1+p^4 + 4f_,x-4pf_,x+4p^2f_,x-4p^3f_,x+8f_,x^2 -8p^2f_,x^2 + & -&32f_,x^3 + 32pf_,x^3 - 8f_,xx+8p^2f_,xx+32f_,xxf_,x -32pf_,xxf_,x _ 1&&2 + 2p+2p^2 + 2p^3 - 16f_,x-8pf_,x-16p^2f_,x-8p^3f_,x + 32f_,x^2 + 16pf_,x^2 + & + & 48p^2f_,x^2 - 64pf_,x^3 - 16f_,xx+16pf_,xx-32pf_,xx+64pf_,xxf_,x  . @xmath35 is excluded since the solution does not correspond to a perfect fluid .",

    "for the second case we have = ah_,vh - h_,vvh_,v  , [ n64 ] which can be integrated to give q = h^a h_,v  , [ n65 ] and equation ( [ n61 ] ) reduces to : 1=f_,xx[f_,x32(ap - a-2p)+8(2-p^2a-2p+4p^2+a ) ]   .[n66 ] it is convenient to divide the analysis into three sub - cases .",
    "equation ( [ n66 ] ) can be readily integrated to give f = p+1 4x- ( 1-p)^2p^2 + 112x+c  , c = const  .",
    "[ n69 ] we notice that for @xmath38 there exists a third killing vector of the form =( 12 + 12hh_,v ) _",
    "t+ ( 12 - 12hh_,v ) _ r+y_y - z_z  .[n70 ]      when @xmath38 the solution is a particular case of sub - case ( a ) .",
    "the remaining cases may now be integrated giving : f=-1-e^-(1+p)x/4 + c  , c = const  .[n73 ] we note that this sub - case admits the further killing vector =( 12 + 1-p4hh_,v)_t+ ( 12 - 1-p4hh_,v)_r+ 1-p2y_y -1-p2z_z  , [ n74 ] which violates our requirement of a maximal three - dimensional conformal group @xmath0 .",
    "a careful analysis of the energy conditions shows that for all cases ( i.e. , for all values of the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) the solutions can only satisfy the energy conditions over certain open domains of the manifold ( see @xcite ) .",
