    "the physics of transport in electronic systems is a cornerstone of our technologies and yet the general problem of non - equilibrium transport seems far from being completely understood .",
    "significant steps in this direction have been taken starting with anderson localization ( or absence of diffusion )  @xcite .",
    "it is well established that in the absence of interactions the energetic mismatch between neighboring sites in a lattice may completely prevent transport by localizing all single - particle states . in this scenario arbitrary weak disorder",
    "localizes one and two - dimensional systems , producing ideal insulators .",
    "much less is known about the effects of the interplay between interaction and disorder .",
    "in fact , despite intensive studies over decades  @xcite , the influence of electron - electron interactions on the transport in disordered electronic systems is still a challenging problem .",
    "more recently it has been theoretically shown that the insulating phase survives the inclusion of a small amount of interaction in a disordered system although , in this case , one can induce transport by increasing the temperature  @xcite .",
    "this investigation has given rise to the emerging field of many - body localization ( mbl ) , which is considered a dynamical transition ; unlike an equilibrium ( conventional ) phase transition , in a mbl transition the properties of the entire set of eigenstates change and one can not restrict the analysis to the ground - state physics .",
    "this dynamical localization has important consequences on time evolution , more specifically on the capacity of the system to self - equilibrate , that is , to act as a reservoir for its subsystems .",
    "localized states may prevent equilibration , since local perturbations do not diffuse throughout the system - such systems are called non - ergodic  @xcite .    in the last few decades",
    "we have witnessed both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite advances in the physics of one - dimensional quantum systems . in particular , after basko s seminal work  @xcite many groups have focused on the non - equilibrium localization of interacting particles . in these works the mbl transition has been studied through different approaches , using , for instance , entanglement properties or eigenstate statistics .",
    "numerical studies have shown that the spectral statistics of a one dimensional system crosses over from those of orthogonal random matrices in the diffusive regime at weak disorder to poisson statistics in the localized regime at strong disorder  @xcite .",
    "concomitantly , dynamical features of disordered and interacting systems were observed focusing on multi - partite correlations  @xcite and on the entanglement entropy .",
    "it was shown that the interplay between interactions and disorder has a strong influence on the long - time behaviour of the entropy  @xcite ; later on it has been concluded that such signatures are just a characteristic trait of interacting systems , since these dynamical tendencies also exist in the absence of disorder and inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the spatial behaviour of the entropy ( von neumann entropy as a function of partition size ) should be more appropriate to address localization , since it saturates when the partition size reaches the localization length  @xcite .",
    "however this is a difficult approach , since the investigation has to be applied to large chains .",
    "in fact , the definite evidence of a mbl transition remains elusive despite creative and innovative efforts  @xcite due to technical difficulties , such as finite size limitation of numerical calculations .    in this work",
    "we study the dynamical state - space localization of an initial state that is maximally localized in real - space and evolves in time with an interacting and disordered hamiltonian . in this way we are able to describe the non - equilibrium localization effects of disorder and interaction in a well defined way which is accessible for small chains .",
    "furthermore , we propose a direct relation between dynamical localization in the state - space and the more standard real - space localization perspective .",
    "we show that when acting alone both disorder and interaction progressively and monotonically localize the system . however ,",
    "when combined , they may lead to delocalization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ ii ] is dedicated to the model .",
    "we study a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) spinless fermion system with nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction and on - site disorder .",
    "the quantity we choose to address dynamical state - space localization ( the loschmidt echo ) is described in section  [ iii ] , as well as the connection with real - space localization .",
    "we present our numerical results in section  [ iv ] .",
    "the last section is dedicated to our comments and conclusions .",
    "the disordered anderson - hubbard model is a standard hamiltonian used to describe the competition between kinetic energy , electron - electron interaction , and disorder .",
    "the fully polarized anderson - hubbard model , or a disordered spinless fermion model , can still describe this competition with less computational effort . in the latter ,",
    "we only retain the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction since a site can not be doubly occupied . the hamiltonian is then given by @xmath0.\\label{eqhami}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term describes the kinetic energy , with @xmath1 being the tunneling between nearest neighbors ; the second describes the local energy of the @xmath2th site , with @xmath3 taken from a uniform distribution @xmath4 $ ] ; finally , the last term represents the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion , with @xmath5 being the interaction strength .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the destruction and number operators acting on site @xmath2 , respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath8 as the unit of energy .",
    "this model can be mapped to the xxz spin-1/2 chain through a jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study small chains with @xmath9 sites and solve the hamiltonian by exact diagonalization .",
    "although the study of small chains is not ideal to describe phase transitions ( defined in the thermodynamic limit ) , it can still produce relevant physical insights about the interplay between interactions and disorder .",
    "furthermore , small systems can be realized in chains of trapped ions  @xcite and cold atoms  @xcite and have been the subject of many recent theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "we choose to describe the competition between disorder and interactions through a state - space localization perspective .",
    "the _ dynamical state - space localization _ can be described by the inverse participation ratio ( ipr )  @xcite of the time average ensemble .",
    "the ipr is calculated through the purity of the time - average ensemble , which gives us an estimate of the inverse of the effective length or area covered by the dynamics : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the dynamically evolving state at a time @xmath12 , starting from an initial state @xmath13 .",
    "the ipr is bounded between unity and @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the site dimension and @xmath16 the dimension of the state - space . if @xmath17 the dynamics are maximally localized meaning that an initial pure state is unaltered throughout the evolution ; if @xmath18 the dynamics are maximally delocalized in the sense that the time - average ensemble is the identity ensemble in which all states contribute with the same probability .",
    "the purity of the average ensemble can also be expressed by the time - average of the loschmidt echo @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "this relation becomes useful in the case where the full diagonalisation or long - time dynamics are unreachable ( which is the case experimentally  @xcite ) and we may use the dynamical behaviour of the echo as a figure of merit . furthermore ,",
    "the echo has proven to be an important tool in characterizing several aspects of the closed system dynamics  @xcite .    considering a non - degenerate hamiltonian",
    ", the above relation corresponds to @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the hamiltonian eigenstates . in this way",
    ", the time averaged echo is related to the fidelity between the initial state and the hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "in this work we calculate the dynamic state - space localization through eq .",
    "( [ echo ] ) . in summary ,",
    "the dynamics of an initial state allowed to evolve in time with a given hamiltonian is localized in the state - space when the participation ratio is close to unity ( @xmath24 ) , while it is delocalized if @xmath25 , meaning that the state covers a large portion of the state - space through the time evolution .",
    "the _ equilibrium real - space localization _ , as introduced by anderson  @xcite , is a single - particle effect in which the wavefunction exhibits exponentially decaying tails . in this way",
    ", each particle can only be found , with considerable probability , inside a finite localization length @xmath26 from a given lattice site .",
    "the definition of real - space localization in a many - body system is more subtle  @xcite and in general we would refer to a correlation length rather than a localization length .",
    "here we relate state - space localization with real - space localization by investigating the participation ratio of the dynamics of a special set of initial states , namely half - filled random _ product _",
    "states , i.e. states of the type @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the eigenstates of the number operator of the `` i - th '' site , and @xmath30 is the number of sites in the chain .",
    "note that such states represent electrons which are _ maximally localized _ in real - space , with a vanishing correlation length ( @xmath31 ) , and we will name their set @xmath32.we perform an average of @xmath33 over @xmath34 initial product states and disordered hamiltonian distributions @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the total averaging , @xmath37 represents the set of drawn on - site energies and @xmath38 is the probability of a disorder configuration .    in the extreme case in which a given product state @xmath39 is allowed to evolve in time with a hamiltonian whose eigenstates @xmath40 are strongly localized in real - space ( i.e. very weakly correlated ) , it will necessarily have a high projection on one of them , i.e. @xmath41 . in this way",
    ", the state almost does not change in time , covering a small portion of the hilbert space during the time evolution ( state - space localization ) , resulting in @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the eigenstates of @xmath43 are @xmath44 delocalized in real - space , @xmath39 will have a small projection all of them , @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the state covers a large portion of the hilbert space during the dynamics , resulting in a large participation ratio @xmath46 ( dynamical state - space delocalization ) .",
    "in general , we expect that , when using random product states ( which are _ maximally localized _ with vanishing correlation length ) as initial states the dynamical localization becomes closely connected to the real - space localization of the hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "therefore , we expect a functional dependence @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 is a decaying function of @xmath26 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the direct relation between real - space and state - space localization depends on the choice of initial state . indeed , there are cases where the states are delocalized in real - space but localized in state - space .",
    "the simplest example is to consider initial states that are ( at least approximately ) eigenstates of a delocalized hamiltonian . in this case",
    "the state would have an extremely long correlation length , however , the echo would remain ( almost ) unaltered throughout the evolution .",
    "one example where @xmath48 can be explicitly obtained is that of noninteracting particles in disordered systems at low density . in this regime",
    "we may approximate the problem by the single particle analysis which allows for a direct analytical treatment of the quantum states .",
    "the presence of scattering centers in a potential induce bound eigenstates which are exponentially decaying around localization centers at @xmath49 as @xmath50 , with a localization length @xmath26 that is proportional to the depth of the potential .    in our analysis",
    "we always initiate the system in a maximally localized state which in the single particle case translates as @xmath51 .",
    "let us now evaluate the echo dependence on the localization length for this particular case : @xmath52 showing that the average echo is inversely proportional to the localization length and @xmath53 as we expected from the reasoning of the last section .",
    "therefore , if the hamiltonian has very deep effects inducing a vanishing localization length the dynamics is localized in state - space . in the other limit when the hamiltonian is almost clean with very large localization length the dynamics is highly delocalized .",
    "hence , we establish an explicit relation between the state - space dynamical localization and the real - space localization .",
    "certainly , such simple functional relation is not necessarily expected for interacting particles .",
    "the previous reasoning can also be seen from the equilibration perspective that allows for the analysis of a broader class of hamiltonians which may account for interactions .",
    "the fact that the dynamics of the initial states ( which are chosen to be localized in real - space ) are localized in the hilbert space implies in the breakdown of the ergodic hypothesis ; the value of a time averaged observable depends on the initial state and the system does not equilibrate .",
    "the absence of equilibration has been used as an indicator of real - space many - body localization in both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies .",
    "more specifically , if one splits a system of @xmath30 sites in two parts ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) and chooses two different initial product states @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( with @xmath58 orthogonal to @xmath59 ) , equilibration guarantees that this choice becomes undetectable , for any practical purpose , if given enough time .",
    "this means , in particular , that the time average of the trace distance @xmath60 of the reduced evolved states of @xmath54 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , should approach zero as @xmath63 : @xmath64 . on the other hand ,",
    "the distance remains large in the absence of equilibration . in the appendix",
    ", we prove that if @xmath65 , with @xmath66 related to the size @xmath67 of the subsystem @xmath54 as @xmath68 , then @xmath69    it is thus shown that if the dynamics of the global system is localized in state - space then it is guaranteed that large enough subsystems composed of @xmath67 sites do not equilibrate .",
    "this means that correlations do not extend over @xmath67 sites and thus the correlation length should be much smaller than this subsystem .",
    "we start by evaluating the participation ratio , @xmath70 , through eq .",
    "( [ average ] ) for the two simplest cases , that is , using a disordered hamiltonian in the absence of interaction and also an interacting non - disordered hamiltonian .",
    "we perform an average oven @xmath71 maximally localized initial states and , in the disordered case , for each initial state we randomly select each site energy with uniform probability between @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in the absence of interactions the presence of disorder localizes the system progressively decreasing its localization length .",
    "this result is represented in fig.[fig1 ] by the monotonic decrease of the participation ratio as we increase disorder , which means the purity of the average ensemble only increases . in this case",
    "the decrease of the participation ratio follows the reduction of transport due to anderson localization .",
    "similarly , for a non - disordered hamiltonian , interaction progressively localizes the system",
    ". however the strongly interacting system is less localized than the strongly disordered system .",
    "the state - space localization analysis seems to indicate a partial transport suppression due to interaction .",
    "this is in agreement with the equilibrium counterpart with a non - null conductivity in a system with large interaction but finite temperature  @xcite .    ) of maximally localized states evolving with a non - disordered hamiltonian as a function of interaction @xmath5 ( black circles ) and with a non - interacting hamiltonian as a function of disorder strength @xmath73 ( red squares ) .",
    "the inset shows a zoom for large interaction / disorder .",

    "[ fig1 ] can be understood by applying standard time - independent perturbation theory to the model hamiltonian of equation ( [ eqhami ] ) . for a specific disorder realization ,",
    "the disordered term of the hamiltonian is diagonal in a basis of random product states and the spectrum of a finite system is non - degenerated .",
    "thus , for strong disorder any product state tends to an eigenstate of the system . in the limit of non - interacting and strongly disordered one - dimensional systems",
    "_ all _ the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eqhami ] ) are strongly localized ; this result leads to @xmath75 .",
    "the electron - electron interaction term of the hamiltonian ( [ eqhami ] ) is diagonal in the same basis .",
    "its eigenstates , however , are degenerated in sub - spaces of equal number @xmath76 of nearest - neighbor filled sites , which we will refer to as @xmath77 subspaces . by including the hopping via degenerated perturbation theory we break the energy degeneracy of these eigenstates and the new eigenstates of the system",
    "become superpositions of localized states belonging to the same @xmath77 subspace .",
    "the dynamics of a given initial product state with @xmath76 nearest - neighbor filled sites is restricted to the corresponding @xmath77 subspace being , therefore , partially localized .",
    "that is why , in the strongly interacting limit , we still observe some residual dynamics .    , for ( top ) disorder strengths @xmath73 as a function of interaction @xmath5 , and ( bottom ) different interactions @xmath5 as a function of disorder @xmath73 .",
    "the results were obtained averaging over @xmath71 different initial random product states and disorder realizations for a chain of @xmath74 sites.,width=264 ]    the competition between disorder and interactions leads to a challenging scenario which can not be described through perturbation theory , but the effects can still be observed in the participation ratio , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . even though their individual natural effect is to localize the system , the combination of disorder and interactions leads to nontrivial behaviour .",
    "in fact , the introduction of disorder in an interacting system ( top panel ) or of interactions in a disordered system ( bottom panel ) leads to delocalization . such interplay continues up until the point at which one of the effects starts to dominate , i.e. when either disorder or interaction becomes the dominant effect .",
    "more specifically , the interplay between interaction and disorder produces a tendency to delocalization when both @xmath5 and @xmath73 are of the same order as the hopping amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "these results are imprinted in the non - monotonic behaviour of the participation ratio . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this behaviour could lead to a reentrant phase diagram similarly to the infinite temperature equilibrium diagram outlined in   and the non - disordered non - equilibrium diagram outlined in  , noting that in the present case it is a genuine non - equilibrium effect of the interplay between interactions and disorder .",
    "for @xmath78 ( top ) as a function of interaction strength and ( bottom ) as a function of the number of sites .",
    "results averaged over 5000 samples for @xmath79 , 2000 samples for @xmath74 , 1000 samples for @xmath80 , and 500 samples for @xmath81.,width=264 ]    the nonequilibrium interplay between disorder and interactions becomes more pronounced for larger systems .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ manyn ] where we show the rescaled inverse echo for different system sizes as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "we scale the echo by the value it assumes when the interaction vanishes . in that case when @xmath82 the interplay induces delocalization . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ manyn ] we see that the region and magnitude above unity increase with the system size . from the bottom panel",
    "we confirm that this effect becomes stronger for larger systems .",
    "we point out that the total mutual entropy has also been shown to have a non - monotonic behaviour  @xcite .",
    "this , once again , hints on the fact that the interplay is also manifested in the spacial correlations and that , indeed , defined with respect to maximally localized states , the average echo is a useful quantifier of localization out of equilibrium .",
    "we note that all the curves for different @xmath30 cross at the same point and we could argue that such crossing could indicate a phase transition in the same spirit that has been previously done in the literature for other quantities .",
    "however , we feel that such a claim is unsubstantiated in the sense that such chain sizes are too small for extracting information about the correlation length in the thermodynamic limit .     as a function of interaction strength for different magnetization subspaces .",
    "results averaged over 1000 samples for @xmath80.,width=7 ]    figures  [ fig1 ] to  [ manyn ] exhibit results for a subspace of half - filled chains ( zero magnetization subspace , in the spin scenario ) ; in fig .  [ mag ]",
    "we show the inverse echo for different filling sectors , analyzing how the results depend on the filling fraction , that is , the number of particles over the number of sites .",
    "add one and two particles to a system at half - filling ( corresponding to subspaces of magnetization @xmath83 and @xmath84 , in spin units , respectively ) progressively localizes the system , as indicated by the reduction of the participation ratio .",
    "the non - trivial interplay between interaction and disorder , which leads to a non - monotonic behavior of the inverse echo , is still present in the sectors we have analyzed , however it becomes less pronounced .",
    "in fact , in the limiting case of fully occupied or fully empty system ( maximal magnetization ) disorder and interactions would not play any role in the participation ratio .",
    "our results should be distinguished from the results in  , in which a local echo is defined based on the magnetization .",
    "firstly the non - monotonic behaviour in   is already present both at zero disorder ( and varying interaction ) or zero interaction ( and varying disorder ) ; secondly even though local probes are highly desirable experimentally , this one in particular is not a direct measure of localization , although a reasonable indicator in some cases .",
    "we also point out that our findings for the loschmidt echo differ significantly from those in   for several reasons : there , the authors use a class of initial states that are local representatives of an energy shell , while our choice is not based on energy but rather randomly selected from the entire set of non - entangled states .",
    "their focus is also on the heisenberg point while we sweep the interaction strength .",

    "results for @xmath74.,width=264 ]    as described above , we perform an average over different initial random product states of full or empty sites , resulting in a half - filled chain ( we remember that the model can be mapped onto a spin - half xxz chain , and in the spin scenario this set of states is equivalent to random product states of spins up and down , with null magnetization ) .",
    "this set is a good representative of real - space localized states in general , which are strongly non - entangled .",

    ", we observe a monotonic decrease of the participation ratio as we increase interaction in a disordered system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it happens because the cdw state , which is the ground state of the strongly interacting clean system , is not a typical localized state .",
    "it is contained in the @xmath88 ( no nearest - neighbor - filled sites ) subspace , spanned by only 2 of the 924 possible product states in a half - filled chain .",

    "the gap distribution is commonly used as an indicator of integrability or chaos .",
    "generically , integrable system exhibits poissonian gap statistics while chaotic systems exhibit wigner - dyson statistics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we expect localized regimes to resemble integrable system and their statistics ( since they have local constants of motion ) while delocalized regimes are expected to resemble non - integrable systems  @xcite . a substantial difference between these two regimes",
    "is that the maximum of the distribution moves closer to zero in case of localization and to positive values in case of delocalization . in fig .",

    "we have used the time - averaged loschmidt echo of maximally localized states to characterize state - space localization .",

    "we have shown that in a system featuring disorder and repulsive interaction , both localizing mechanisms , the interplay between them can actually lead to delocalization .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that each mechanism localizes the dynamics in a different sense and , when they are of the same order of the hopping amplitude , their competition partially cancels each other s effect .",
    "this non - trivial interplay is also imprinted in the gap distribution of the hamiltonian indicating that it also affects the integrability of the system .",
