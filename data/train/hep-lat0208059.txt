    "the spectral functions ( spfs ) of hadronic operators play an important role in qcd .",
    "the modification of hadrons , which has been suggested , for example , by the dilepton production enhancement in high energy nuclear collisions observed at cern sps , can be formulated in terms of spfs .",
    "although there have been numerous theoretical attempts to understand the modification of spfs at finite temperature and/or density @xcite , the exact nature of the hadronic modes in matter is not understood well .",
    "recently , the maximum entropy method ( mem ) has been used to extract spfs from lattice qcd data for the first time by the present authors @xcite .",
    "the euclidean 2-point functions in the temporal direction and the associated spfs are related by the laplace transform . on the lattice ,",
    "only a finite number of data points with statistical noise are available in the temporal direction .",
    "therefore , direct laplace inversion from lattice data to spf is an ill - posed problem .",
    "mem is a method to evade such difficulty on the basis of the bayes theorem in the theory of statistical inference @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed in detail in @xcite , the result of mem depends strongly on the number of temporal data points .",
    "the more data points are used , the closer the mem result is to the true spf .",
    "moreover , there is the minimum number of data points @xmath6 to perform the reliable mem analysis .    in order to find this minimum @xmath6 at @xmath7 on the lattice ,",
    "we have carried out the following analysis @xcite .",
    "first we calculated hadronic correlators with the quenched approximation on an isotropic @xmath8 lattice at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the number of gauge configurations is 160 .",
    "then , mem analysis has been done for the vector channel by using @xmath6 data points ( at @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) out of the total 30 data points .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ ntchange ] .",
    "the figure clearly shows that , spf changes considerably as @xmath6 and that at least about 30 data points are necessary for the convergence of the result .",
    "this minimum @xmath6 would depend on @xmath12 , and on whether one employs anisotropic lattices , improved actions , and so on .",
    "nevertheless , we use this number as a practical guide in the following .",
    "at finite temperature ( @xmath14 ) , because of the relation @xmath15 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the temporal lattice size and spacing , respectively ) , less and less data points are available as @xmath14 increases if @xmath17 is fixed . requiring that @xmath18 holds even at the highest @xmath14 , e.g. @xmath19 ,",
    "we are inevitably led to use an anisotropic lattice .",
    "we have used the bare anisotropy @xmath20 and @xmath21 with the naive plaquette action . for the quark part , the standard wilson action with the quenched approximation is used .",
    "the corresponding renormalized anisotropy is @xmath3 @xcite and the lattice spacing is @xmath22 fm .",
    "simulations are done on @xmath23 lattices with @xmath24 40 , 54 , 72 , 80 , and 96 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "more than 100 configurations are generated for each @xmath31 .",
    "the details of the lattice parameters used in the calculation will be given in @xcite .",
    "we have studied 2-point correlation functions in the scalar ( s ) , pseudo - scalar ( ps ) , vector ( v ) , and axial - vector ( av ) channels . the default models , motivated by perturbative qcd , in each channel are @xmath32 , 1.15 , 0.40 , and 0.35 , respectively .",
    "the lattice data points used in our mem analysis are @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 , 72 , 80 , and 96 . for @xmath36 and 40 , @xmath37",
    "when the source and sink are closer than @xmath38 in the temporal direction , artifact could arise due to unphysical modes at @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we leave out the data points near the edges , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    the number of lattice data points used in the mem analysis is fixed almost the same at each @xmath31 except at @xmath42 to keep the resolution in the mem analysis unchanged .",
    "the rest of the mem procedures such as the averaging over @xmath43 are basically the same as described in @xcite and will be presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "[ polyakov ] shows the polyakov loop expectation value @xmath44 at each @xmath31 .",
    "it starts to deviate from zero around @xmath45 , which corresponds to @xmath46 mev , and is comparable to the real value 271 @xmath47 2 mev . we have checked that the polyakov loop susceptibility also shows a peak in this region . in the following ,",
    "we use the number @xmath48 mev .",
    "in fig . [ spf_nt54 ] , we show the results of the mem analysis for spf @xmath49 in the s , ps , v , and av channels on @xmath50 lattice ( @xmath51 ) . in this calculation",
    ", we have used the hopping parameter corresponding to @xmath52 at @xmath7 .",
    "if the quark - gluon plasma is such an object as described as a free gas of massive quarks , anti - quarks and gluons , @xmath49 would show a flat behavior with a smooth rise from zero above the @xmath53 threshold as a function of @xmath54 . to the contrary , fig .",
    "[ spf_nt54 ] shows that spfs possess nontrivial structures even above @xmath0 in all four channels .",
    "there are a sharp peak at about @xmath55 gev and two bumps above the peak .",
    "also spfs in all channels almost degenerate , which shows a strong signature of the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "the peak and bump structures , and the suppression of spfs below @xmath55 gev are statistically significant according to our error analysis . we have used @xmath31 twice as large as that employed in @xcite . as shown in sec.2 , this is necessary for reliable mem analysis .    in fig .",
    "[ spf_nt40 ] , we show the results at @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "there is an apparent peak around @xmath58 .",
    "a possible explanation of the peak is the effect of landau damping @xcite .",
    "however , this peak is , at the moment , not statistically significant yet .",
    "the peaks around @xmath59 gev are significantly broader than those around 2 gev at @xmath60 .",
    "we have carried out an error analysis for the average of the spfs in small regions around the peaks and found that the broadening is indeed statistically significant .",
    "spfs in the case of @xmath42 @xmath61 have similar structures as those at @xmath60 except the shift of the peak positions .",
    "this suggests a possibility of a qualitative change in the state of the deconfined phase between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
