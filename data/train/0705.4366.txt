    "for example , the statistical mechanics of stellar systems ( like globular clusters and elliptical galaxies ) in astrophysics and the statistical mechanics of large - scale vortices ( like jupiter s great red spot ) in two - dimensional turbulence present deep similarities @xcite despite the very different physical nature of these systems .",
    "some connections have also been developed between the dynamics of stellar systems and the dynamics of the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite and of the free electron laser @xcite .",
    "more recently , the authors have studied a model of self - gravitating brownian particles @xcite and discovered striking analogies with the bose - einstein condensation in the canonical ensemble @xcite and with the phenomenon of chemotaxis in biology @xcite . in this paper , we point out a novel analogy between the chandrasekhar limiting mass of white dwarf stars @xcite and the critical mass of bacterial populations experiencing chemotactic aggregation .",
    "the name chemotaxis refers to the motion of organisms induced by chemical signals @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the biological organisms ( bacteria , amoebae , endothelial cells , ants ... ) secrete a substance ( pheromone , smell , food , ... ) that has a long - range attractive effect on the organisms themselves .",
    "therefore , in addition to their diffusive motion , they move preferentially along the gradient of concentration of the chemical they secrete ( chemotactic flux ) .",
    "when attraction prevails over diffusion , the chemotaxis can trigger a self - accelerating process until a point at which aggregation takes place .",
    "this is the case for the slime mold _ dictyostelium discoideum _ and for the bacteria _",
    "escherichia coli_. this is referred to as chemotactic collapse .",
    "a model of slime mold aggregation has been introduced by keller & segel @xcite in the form of two coupled differential equations .",
