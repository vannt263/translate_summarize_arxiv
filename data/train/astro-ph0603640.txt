    "one of the central problems in astronomy is that of galaxy formation and evolution : when were the visible parts of galaxies assembled , when were the stars formed , and how did this depend on environment ?    at low redshift the dependence of galaxy properties on environment is well established .",
    "dense environments contain a larger fraction of red , passive galaxies , while low density environments show more blue , star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , lewis et al .",

    ", star - forming cluster galaxies tend to have lower rates of star formation than those in the field ( moss & whittle 1993 , 2000 ) .",
    "these star formation patterns are accompanied by a morphological trend , such that denser regions have a larger fraction of early - types than the field ( morgan 1961 , dressler 1980 ) . however , the origin of these environmental dependences is not yet clear , and continues to be debated .    as well as the local variation in galaxy properties with environment , there are differences between the galaxy populations observed in comparable environments at different cosmic epochs . in intermediate - redshift clusters",
    "there are a higher fractions of blue ( butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ) , star - forming ( couch & sharples 1987 , dressler & gunn 1992 , poggianti et al . 1999 ) , and spiral ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) galaxies than in comparable local clusters .",
    "the integrated star formation rate per cluster mass is thus larger for higher redshift clusters ( finn et al .",
    "2005 , homeier et al .",
    "however , the field also evolves substantially with redshift ( e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "1997 ) , and intermediate - redshift cluster galaxies still always tend to have lower star formation rates ( balogh et al .",
    "1998 ) , star - forming fractions ( postman et al .",

    "recently the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) has been used to investigate the differential evolution of cluster versus field galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "this method effectively utilizes rotation velocity , a proxy for total mass , as a baseline against which other galaxy properties , in this case luminosity , can be compared for different samples .",
    "ziegler et al . ( 2003 ) have concluded that cluster galaxies at @xmath4@xmath5 are distributed in the tully - fisher diagram similarly to field galaxies at the same redshifts , suggesting that the mass - to - light ratios of cluster galaxies are not affected by physical processes specific to high density regions .",
    "in contrast , milvang - jensen et al . ( 2003 ) found mild evidence that cluster galaxies are brighter than field ones at a fixed rotation velocity . using a larger sample , bamford et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also found that for luminous , star - forming field and cluster disc galaxies at @xmath6 , the cluster galaxies are systematically brighter with respect to the tully - fisher relation of the field at the @xmath7 level .",
    "they speculate that this might be due to the increased presence of young stellar populations in galaxies which have recently entered the cluster environment , due to an enhancement of star formation caused by some interaction with that environment",

    "these studies imply that lower luminosity field galaxies have experienced substantial chemical evolution since @xmath8 , while the brightest galaxies have changed little .",

    "the comparison sample of intermediate redshift field galaxies was selected and analysed in an identical manner to the sample studied in this paper .    to investigate differences between the properties of @xmath17 cluster galaxies and the general present day galaxy population , we require a local comparison sample .",
    "for this we use the sample of jansen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who observed the nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs ) of about 200 galaxies .",
    "the nfgs was selected from the first cfa redshift catalogue ( huchra et al .",
    "1983 ) to approximate the local galaxy luminosity function . to select star - forming galaxies in the original nfgs sample , we use the classical diagnostic ratios of two pairs of relatively strong emission lines ( baldwin et al . 1981",
    "; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "the colour excess from obscuration by dust for nfgs sample galaxies was estimated from the observed ratio of and line fluxes .",
    "we adopt the milky way interstellar extinction law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , with @xmath18 , and assume an intrinsic balmer decrement of @xmath19 , corresponding to the case b recombination with a temperature of @xmath20 and a density of @xmath21 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .    gas phase oxygen abundances",

    "the parameter is both abundance- and ionization - sensitive ( e.g. , kewley & dopita 2002 ) . the correction of this dependence of parameter on ionization is usually done by using the ionization - sensitive diagnostic ratio =/ ( e.g. , mcgaugh 1991 ; kewley & dopita 2002 ) .",
    "note that the oxygen abundance estimated using different calibrations available in the literature might differ by factors up to @xmath23 ( ellison & kewley 2005 ) , however , as our main interest is to study the relative change in oxygen abundances between cluster and field galaxies , the exact choice of the vs. calibration is not a critical issue .",
    "here we determine oxygen abundance using the calibration of mcgaugh ( 1991 ) , as taken from in kobulnicky , kennicutt & pizagno ( 1999 ) .",
    "the use of parameter to estimate oxygen abundance is complicated by the degenerate dependence of this parameter on metallicity : at the same value of , different ionization parameters correspond to different oxygen abundances ( mccall et al .",
    "the observed emission lines for our sample galaxy spectra are not enough to break the degeneracy . however ,",
    "when the needed emission lines to do so are observed for intermediate redshift galaxies with similar luminosities , they are found to lie on the metal - rich branch of the versus calibration ( kobulnicky et al .",

    ", we make the assumption that the galaxies in our sample lie on the upper metallicity branch of the versus calibration . and",
    "have been estimated using emission line equivalent widths .",
    "kobulnicky & phillips ( 2003 ) have shown that estimates of both ratios using equivalent widths give results similar to using emission line fluxes .    for one galaxy in the sample ,",
    "the oxygen abundance estimated using the low - branch of metallicity calibration , given its and parameters , was larger than that derived using the upper - branch .",
    "this occurs when the measured parameter reaches a higher value than the maximum allowed by the photoionization model , i.e. , for a given .",
    "the estimate of oxygen abundance in this case is highly uncertain .",
    "no estimate of the oxygen abundance was made for this galaxy .",
    "none of the objects in our sample have both and emission lines present in their covered spectral range , so the dust obscuration can not be derived using the balmer decrement .",
    "however , it is possible to estimate the amount of internal extinction by comparing the energy balance between the luminosities of two different star formation indicators , and in this case after applying the appropriate corrections , that are free from systematic effects other than dust reddening , i.e. , that do not depend on the metallicity or excitation state of the emitting gas .",
    "the star formation rate in terms of the emission line includes a correction factor to account for the effect of metallicity on the variation of the / flux ratio , as calibrated by kewley , geller & jansen ( 2004 ; see mouhcine et al .",

    "in addition to the visual comparison between our cluster and field samples afforded by these histograms , we have quantitatively compared the parameters .",
    "this has been done primarily by estimating the difference between the parameters parent distribution means and evaluating the significance of this difference .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "the figures presented in this table are from a comparison utilising robust biweight estimators ( e.g. , beers , flynn & gebhardt 1990 ) .",
    "the probability that the parent distributions have the same mean is evaluated by a robust t - test , which does not assume that the distributions have equal variances ( welch 1937 ) .",
    "similar results are found using canonical statistics , both unweighted and with weights corresponding to the measurement errors with the inclusion of an intrinsic dispersion term .",
    "an exception is @xmath26 , for which the less robust statistics find a less significant difference between the cluster and field samples .",

    "the equivalent widths of and are on average significantly lower for cluster galaxies than for field galaxies in our samples , both by a factor of @xmath29 . if there is no variation in broad - band luminosities ( @xmath25 ) between these galaxy samples , these equivalent width ratios imply similar emission line luminosity ratios .",
    "star formation rate is proportional to the luminosity and , upto a metallicity and ionisation dependence , to the luminosity .",
    "we therefore expect the star formation rates of our cluster galaxies to be on average lower than those in our field sample , by a similar factor .",
    "indeed , we find this to be true , by a factor of @xmath30 . however , this result is less significant than that based solely upon the equivalent widths .",
    "the robust statistics presented in table [ tab : param ] find the difference to be @xmath31% , but canonical statistics and the ks - test find no significant difference .",
    "also , if the comparison is performed in the log - regime , which may be more appropriate , no significant difference is found .",
    "this reduction in significance is probably due to broad - band luminosity variations .",
    "the spread in luminosity ( @xmath32 mag , therefore a factor of @xmath33 in luminosity ) is comparable to the spread in equivalent width , and appears to blur out the differences between the cluster and field samples , reducing the significance of the difference , but not particularly affecting its magnitude .",
    "however , these statistics do not tell the whole story .",
    "while most cluster galaxies have equivalent widths on the low side of the field distrib , there are several objects ( @xmath34@xmath35% ) which have equivalent widths as high as any of the field galaxies .",

    "the hint of a bimodality in the star formation rates per unit luminosity of distant cluster galaxies , with the majority being suppressed , but some apparently enhanced , lends support to a mechanism for galaxy evolution in clusters which causes a temporary increase in the star formation rate of galaxies prior to a decline in their star formation .",

    "we have examined the oxygen abundances for our galaxies , but are unable to discriminate between our cluster and field samples in terms of their chemical and ionisation properties .",

    "two galaxies in our cluster sample show oxygen abundances significantly lower , but with similar emission line equivalent widths , than what is seen locally for similar luminosities .",
    "one of these two objects has measured rotation velocity and emission scale length , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this object is similar to the sub - population of massive and large galaxies in the intermediate redshift field that are offset with respect to the local luminosity  metallicity relation . given its rotation velocity and physical size , this object is likely to evolve into a massive , metal - rich galaxy in the local universe , rather than fading into a dwarf galaxy .",

    "it may be a recent addition to the cluster , but there is no evidence for or against this .",
    "alternatively , the similarities between intermediate redshift field and cluster galaxies we have found could be due to the lack of the required statistical power to measure the differences , due to our small sample size .",
    "however , we have established some upper limits on the possible differences between the samples .",
    "the sample considered in this paper is not large or diverse enough to address the issue of differential evolution of cluster and field galaxies quantitatively .",

    "<S> we examine the evolutionary status of luminous , star - forming galaxies in intermediate - redshift clusters by considering their star formation rates and the chemical and ionsiation properties of their interstellar emitting gas . </S>",

    "<S> we compare these galaxies with the identically selected and analysed intermediate - redshift field sample of mouhcine et al . </S>",

    "<S> we measure the equivalent widths of , and emission lines to determine diagnostic line ratios , oxygen abundances , and extinction - corrected star formation rates . </S>",
    "<S> the star - forming galaxies in intermediate - redshift clusters display emission line equivalent widths which are , on average , significantly smaller than measured for field galaxies at comparable redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> however , a contrasting fraction of our cluster galaxies have equivalent widths similar to the highest observed in the field . </S>",
    "<S> this tentatively suggests a bimodality in the star - formation rates per unit luminosity for galaxies in distant clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for further bimodalities , or differences between our cluster and field samples , when examining additional diagnostics and the oxygen abundances of our galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this maybe because no such differences exist , perhaps because the cluster galaxies which still display signs of star - formation have recently arrived from the field . in order to examine this topic with more certainty , and to further investigate the way in which any disparity varies as a function of cluster properties , larger spectroscopic samples are needed .    </S>",
