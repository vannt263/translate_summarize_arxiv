    "the same design principles can be applied to other integrated systems , as well as bulk optical systems .",
    "the ampp source uses photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite .",
    "spdc is a second - order nonlinear optical process characterized by the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the annihilation operator corresponding to the signal ( idler ) photon and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the second order nonlinear susceptibility tensor and @xmath6 is a classical pump field @xcite .",
    "the time - evolved state of the signal and idler photons is given by    @xmath7    this can be expanded in the fock basis to calculate the probability of generating @xmath8 pairs in some time @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents @xmath8 ( @xmath12 ) photons in the signal ( idler ) rail @xcite and @xmath13 .",
    "therefore as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , a single pair state . detecting the idler photon of each pair indicates the existence of the signal photon @xcite , which yields highly indistinguishable @xcite heralded single photons . in this paper , we will assume the use of periodically poled potassium tytanil phosphate ( ppktp ) waveguide sources , which have been shown to produce highly indistinguishable photon pairs @xcite , and to enable efficient heralded single photon emission @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to the approximately poissonian number state distribution , the source must be driven weakly so that @xmath16 .",
    "such a source is not suitable for many scalable quantum information technologies including linear optics quantum computation @xcite .",
    "it is possible to improve this efficiency by actively switching multiple sources into a single output , contingent upon heralding @xcite .",

    "proposals using strictly @xmath19 switches for @xmath20 require order of @xmath17 switch scaling @xcite to accomplish this spatial multiplexing .",
    "we are able to reduce the switch number to order of @xmath21 by using the time - multiplexing scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] . in this scheme",
    "a single spdc element is pumped at some period @xmath22 so that photon pairs are generated according to the poisson statistics in each time bin .",
    "the idler photons are sent to a detector and the corresponding signal photons routed to a variable delay circuit .",
    "based on the detection of the idler photons , one signal photon is routed to a single time bin , while any others are rejected .",
    "thus , the scheme targets pulsed single photon emission with a period of @xmath23 @xcite .    we alter the variable delay circuit of previous schemes from a single delay line to one composed of separate delays @xmath24 with time delay @xmath25 ; any delay from @xmath26 to @xmath27 can be constructed as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . in this representation ,",

    "switching loss scales exponentially with the number of switches a photon passes through , so our switching loss scaling is of order @xmath17 .",

    "an eight - pulse train is generated that then pumps a nonlinear crystal cut for type - ii spdc , so that a polarizing beam splitter can separate the degenerate signal and idler photons generated at @xmath0 nm .",
    "the laser power is set such that there is a 5% chance of multiphoton emission ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the idler photons are sent to the ` heralding decision block , ' which consists of a single photon detector ( d ) , data processor ( p ) , bit generator ( bg ) , and decision switch on - chip .",

    "the processor outputs to a bit generator which modulates the decision switch on - chip , selecting which signal photon will enter the ` variable delay circuit ' block .",
    "the variable delay contains static delays of lengths @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath22 , and 2@xmath382 switches leading in and out of each .",
    "these switches allow selection of the coefficients @xmath39 .",
    "the data processing unit required for this protocol will be discussed in detail in section iii and is only outlined here . the processor input is the serial @xmath17-bit stream from the heralding detector : 1 ( 0 ) corresponds to a ( no ) detection event .",

    "however this source can serve as the building block for an active time - multiplexed hbs source .",
    "the resulting protocol would follow the same multiplexing principle described in section iii for ampp generation , however it would take as its input periodic single photons from ampp sources to generate periodic bell states .    alternatively , entangled photons suitable for certain quantum key distribution schemes @xcite can be generated in a simpler way @xcite using only two ampp sources , as shown in fig .
