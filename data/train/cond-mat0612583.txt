    "in the recent years the quantum impurity problem out - of - equilibrium has attracted great interest .",
    "the most relevant realizations are the quantum dots connected to at least two metallic leads@xcite and short metallic wires containing magnetic impurities@xcite . in the impurity problem",
    "the exact methods play distinguished roles especially the bethe ansatz and conformal invariance .",
    "the generalization of these methods to out - of - equilibrium situations are the most challenging new directions .",
    "mehta and andrei are aiming to solve the kondo problem on a dot with two contact attached . first a simple resonant level without spin was studied to test the new generalization of the bethe ansatz method@xcite .",
    "their elegant suggestion is very provocative . in order to test this kind of new methods",
    "we perform a detailed study of that problem using different weak coupling perturbative methods combined with nrg . as the final goal",
    "we calculate the current flowing through the impurity when a finite voltage is applied on the contacts .",
    "the most challenging claim of mehta and andrei is that the current is a non - monotonic function of the strength of the coulomb coupling between the electron on the dot and conduction electrons in the two leads . in order to make the comparison more explicite",
    "we generalize the time - ordered scattering formalism for non - equilibrium in the next leading logarithmic order . in this way the current is calculated as a function of the applied voltage and the coulomb coupling strength .",
    "increasing the coulomb coupling strength we find also a non - monotonic feature but the order of increasing and decreasing regions is the opposite to the finding of mehta and andrei@xcite .",
    "the model to be treated is the following : a single impurity orbital is coupled to two reservoirs of fermi gas via hopping but the two reservoirs have different chemical potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 on left and right of the impurity in a one dimensional model .",
    "@xmath2 is determined by the applied voltage @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the electronic charge ) .",
    "the coulomb interaction acts between the electron on the impurity level and the conduction electrons at the impurity position .",
    "thus the hamiltonian has the form @xmath5 with @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the fermi velocity , @xmath10 is the creation operator of the spinless fermion in lead @xmath11 , while @xmath12 is the energy of the local level and @xmath13 is the creation operator for the electron on that site .",
    "the interaction term is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coulomb coupling which in a physical case @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the length of the chain .",
    "the existence of the substraction of @xmath19 is not essential , they can be omitted and than @xmath12 is shifted as @xmath20 and a local potential @xmath21 is acting on the electrons , but the latter one can be taken into account by changing the electron density of states in the leads at the position of the impurity .",
    "the hybridization between the lead electrons and the localized electron is described by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the hybridization matrix element .    in case of equilibrium",
    "it is useful to generalize the model to @xmath24 reservoirs instead of @xmath18 , @xmath25 , and then @xmath26 runs through @xmath27 and @xmath28 . then the hybridization term in @xmath29",
    "is chosen in a specific form @xmath30 indicating that only the electrons with @xmath31 are hybridizing while the others are taking part only in the coulomb screening .",
    "namely , only those electrons are hybridizing which have the symmetry of the localized orbital ( @xmath32-like ) . as a result of the screening the electron gas",
    "is polarized depending on the occupation of the localized state and that polarizations lead to orthogonality catastrophe@xcite .    the model with @xmath33",
    "is known as a resonant level model and has been studied in great detail@xcite and the one with @xmath34 has been introduced to study finite range interaction in 3d@xcite .    the goal of the present paper is to provide weak coupling results for @xmath35 .",
    "but before doing that the @xmath36 equilibrium case is studied in the weak coupling limit by diagram technique and then to extend the results for stronger couplings wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite and anderson - yuval coulomb gas method@xcite in order to check the validity of weak coupling results concerning a specific behavior .",
    "namely at some stage of the calculation in the exponent of the renormalized quantities a combination    @xmath37    appears . for @xmath16 that is changing sign at @xmath38 and",
    "that leads in changing the increasing to decreasing behavior but that crossover is well beyond the validity of the perturbation theory at least for @xmath39 .    in order to judge the real situation ,",
    "an nrg study will be performed including the weak ( @xmath40 ) as well as strong coupling regions ( @xmath41 ) to get an insight whether the crossover indicated above is expected or it is likely artifact of the weak coupling theory .",
    "we also map the problem to a one - dimensional coulomb model closely following the work of anderson and yuval , where the screening can even be in the strong coupling limit .",
    "all of these methods are suggesting a coherent picture of the crossover and they agree very well especially for @xmath42 .",
    "the study of such a crossover is especially relevant as in the work of mehta and andrei@xcite such a crossover is suggested in the current flowing in the non - equilibrium case @xmath35 at @xmath43 . if we could find the crossover already in equilibrium then it is obvious to expect that in the non - equilibrium situation .    the paper is organized in the following way : in section  [ sec : weak_coup ] we provide the analytical perturbative method up to next to leading logarithmic order introducing extra channels for screening , where the non - monotonic competion of the vertex and self - energy correction is already demonstrated in equilibrium . in section  [ sec : nrg ] the equilibrium calculation is extended to strong coupling by using wilson s numerical renormalization group technique and the result is compared to that of the analytical calculation . in section  [ app : karcsi ]",
    "the anderson - yuval method is presented . in section  [ sec : out_of_equ ] the time dependent scattering method is applied for non - equilibrium closely following the generalized version of anderson s poor man s scaling in the next to leading order and the current is calculated . in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "the results are summarized . in appendix a some cancellation due to ward indetities are discussed .",
    "the resonant level model is given by eqs .",
    "( [ hs ] ) , ( [ h_0 ] ) and ( [ h_2 ] ) . that does not contain non - commuting terms , thus kondo behavior",
    "is not expected in the weak coupling limit . in the strong coupling limit that model , however , can be mapped to an anisotropic kondo model@xcite but that mapping is not considered here .",
    "the model shows strong similarities to the x - ray absorption@xcite , as the strength of the interaction ( invariant charge ) between conduction electrons and the electron on the impurity level is scale invariant .",
    "the system shows scaling in terms of reduction of the conduction electron band width , @xmath44 . in case @xmath33 the scaling equations",

    "there are two different kinds of vertex corrections depicted in fig.[fig : vertex_corr ] a , b , c , where the solid lines stand for conduction electrons , the dotted line for electron on the impurity level and the interactions are indicated by dots ( @xmath15 ) and crosses ( @xmath3 ) . in case of conduction electrons the channel indices are also indicated .",
    "the hartree - fock energy shift can be incorporated by @xmath12 .",
    "the self - energy of the electron on the impurity is depicted in fig.[fig : vertex_corr ] d. in the calculation of the self - energy counter terms are introduced to eliminate the constant terms to keep @xmath45 unrenormalized . closely following the earlier works @xcite , the invariant charge for the coulomb interaction takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the vertex function and @xmath48 can be determined perturbatively starting with 1 where @xmath49 is the renormalized one - electron green s function .",
    "the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the conduction electron density of states , for spinless electrons in one of the channels @xmath54 .",
    "as the coulomb interaction is independent of @xmath55 , thus the factor @xmath24 occurs . as the consequence of the ward identity relating the vertex correction and the self - energy depicted in fig.[fig : vertex_corr]c and d cancel out in @xmath56@xcite @xmath57 thus @xmath58 .",
    "the renormalization group gives @xmath59 for arbitrary @xmath55 .",
    "the hybridization contains vertex correction for @xmath60 ( fig.[fig : v_corr ] ) @xmath61 but it does not contain linear contribution in @xmath62 in the order of @xmath63 . the relevant invariant charge @xmath64 is @xmath65 as the interaction is connected by only one impurity line .",
    "thus the terms linear in @xmath62 are    @xmath66    the result of the renormalization equation is @xmath67 the second term in the exponent appears as reduction of @xmath64 describing the coulomb screening in the @xmath24 channels .    for @xmath68",
    "the @xmath64 interaction is always decreasing as @xmath69 is reduced but for @xmath16 it depends on the strength of @xmath15 .",
    "for large enough @xmath15 the screening dominates thus @xmath70 that behavior will be further discussed in sec.[sec : summary ] .    the scaling regions , however , are not unlimited as the impurity level has its own width , @xmath71 .",
    "there are two contributions to the level width @xmath71 .",
    "the hybridization broadens the impurity level just in case of the anderson model and that is in the second order in @xmath3 @xmath72 where also the effect of renormalization is taken into account .",
    "there is also a korringa like broadening due to the creation of electron - hole pairs thus @xmath73 , where @xmath69 comes from the phase space .",
    "that is important only for large @xmath69 where everything is smooth thus the broadening is not effective .",
    "the broadening due to the hybridization cuts off the renormalization procedure at energy @xmath74 .",
    "combining eqs.([eq : v_scaling ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and inserting the condition given above provides the final @xmath75 value as @xmath76     for different channel numbers .",

    "first @xmath75 increases with increasing @xmath15 but for @xmath80 it starts to decrease and tends to zero again .",
    "the intermediate maximum appears at @xmath81 . for @xmath39",
    "that maximum is , however , already outside the weak coupling limit , where the calculation can not be trusted .",
    "the question still remains unanswered whether the non - monotonic behavior for @xmath16 can be traced in strong coupling calculation or not .",
    "the conclusions for the crossover might be trusted only for large @xmath82 , which does not have physical relevance .",
    "in order to determine the region of validity of the weak coupling approach in equilibrium , we have performed numerical renormalization group@xcite ( nrg ) analysis for the @xmath39 and @xmath42 cases .    in wilson s nrg technique after",
    "the logarithmic discretization of the conduction band one maps the original hamiltonian of an impurity problem to a semi - infinite chain with the impurity at the end of the chain . as a consequence of the logarithmic discretization",
    "the hopping amplitude along the chain decreases exponentially as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a discretization parameter ( we have used @xmath85 throughout the calculations ) while @xmath55 is the site index .",
    "the separation of energy scales provided by the exponentially vanishing hopping amplitude allows us to diagonalize the hamiltonian iteratively to approximate the ground state and the excitation spectrum of the full chain .",
    "since we know the eigenenergies and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian , we can calculate dynamical quantities such as the density of states using the lehman representation of the spectral function@xcite .",

    "the extension of that method is presented to next leading order . for equilibrium first the kondo model was treated by that way @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to calculate the development of the initial @xmath141 state to the final @xmath142 one , but in second order the renormalization of the norms of those states must be corrected also .",

    "calculate at the level occupation @xmath194 and the current @xmath195 for the given value of the voltage .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : current ] for @xmath196 .    0.5 cm , and @xmath197 .",
    "for this range of interaction strength the weak coupling method was reliable in equilibrium . ,",
    "title=\"fig : \" ] 0.5 cm    0.5 cm , and @xmath198 .",
    "note that the weak coupling result is reliable for @xmath94 only .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] 0.5 cm    in that regime of @xmath15 the weak coupling rg gave good results in equilibrium ( presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : nrg ] ) therefore one expects reliable results in out - of - equilibrium as well . as it is shown in fig.[fig : current ] , the current increases with increasing interaction strength .",
    "the results can be interpreted as follows : with increasing @xmath15 the impurity spectral function gets broadened since the hybridization is enhanced . in the linear regime ( @xmath199 ) the @xmath15-dependence drops out since the increase of coupling to the leads @xmath200 is cancelled by the decrease of the height of the @xmath154-level spectral function which scale as @xmath201 . for larger values of the voltage @xmath202 the @xmath154-level",
    "is experienced not only at the peak of the spectral function ( @xmath203 ) thus the current is not linear in @xmath152 any more . for @xmath204",
    "the complete @xmath154-level contributes to the current thus it saturates and the asymptotic value is proportional to @xmath200 .",
    "the resonant level model studied has very different behavior for attractive and repulsive interaction .",
    "this difference can be understood using the site representation for conduction electrons in the strong @xmath15 limit by the following argument :    \\(i ) _ in case of attractive interaction _ the particle on the @xmath154-level attracts electrons to pile up around the impurity occupying the next site thus the electron on the @xmath154-level is blocked for hopping to the conduction band .",
    "\\(ii ) _ in case of repulsive interaction _ the site next to the occupied @xmath154-level is empty thus that electron can easily jump to the conduction band .",
    "all the methods predict that increasing the strength of an attractive interaction the hopping rate @xmath3 is reduced and for strong enough coupling it even goes to zero ( see fig.[fig : v_ren_n2n4 ] for @xmath205 ) .",
    "the effect of orthogonality catastrophe reducing the hopping is less relevant because that have been already reduced by the vertex correction .    in the repulsive case for large @xmath15 the orthogonality catastrophe ( self - energy correction ) is reducing essentially the hopping rate .",
    "thus the effective hopping @xmath206 is first enhanced by the effect described above and can reach a maximum which is followed by a reduction due to the orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "the position of the maximum can be pushed to lower energies by increasing the number of the screening channels @xmath24 thus the perturbative result becomes more and more reliable . in case of @xmath39 the latter method leads to a pronounced maximum but the nrg indicates only slowly varying bump . in the anderson - yuval approach the maximum is even pushed to infinity .",
    "thus the existence of the maximum is supported only by the nrg .    considering the time ordered scattering formalism the results are in accordance with the expectation of the weak coupling result for @xmath39 .",
    "the increasing @xmath15 results in increasing current as first @xmath3 is increased but for larger @xmath15 due to the orthogonality catastrophe the current is essentially reduced ( see fig.[fig : current_decrease ] ) . as the nrg does not give a sharp crossover for the hopping rate @xmath206 thus the corresponding effect in the current must be less pronounced in reality .",
    "of course , for @xmath207 the crossover must clearly exist .",
    "unfortunately , in the work of mehta and andrei the crossover is in the range of reduced current , which is just the opposite what is expected on the ground of the physical picture established and results obtained by different methods for the hopping rate .",
    "very detailed further studies of the bethe ansatz method are needed to understand and resolve the origin of the presented discrepancies .",

    "as noted earlier , the logarithmic terms come from diagrams ( v),(vi ) and ( vii ) .",
