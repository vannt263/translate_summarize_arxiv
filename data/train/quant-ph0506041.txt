    "an important step is the discovery of an entropic uncertainty relation ( eur),@xcite which for a three - dimensional system has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the information entropy in position - space of the density distribution @xmath6 of a quantum system @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the information entropy in momentum - space of the corresponding momentum distribution @xmath9 @xmath10    the density distributions @xmath6 and @xmath9 are normalized to one .",
    "inequality ( [ eq : equ2 ] ) , for the information entropy sum in conjugate spaces , is a joint measure of uncertainty of a quantum mechanical distribution , since a highly localized @xmath6 is associated with a diffuse @xmath9 , leading to low @xmath5 and high @xmath8 and vice - versa .",

    "it is noted that recently we have obtained the same form for systems of correlated bosons in a trap.@xcite this concept was also found to be useful in a different context . using the formalism in phase - space of ghosh , berkowitz and parr,@xcite we found that the larger the information entropy the better the quality of the nuclear density distribution.@xcite    in previous work we employed one - body density distributions in the definition of @xmath11 . in the present paper",

    "the fact that @xmath19 becomes minimum for equal probabilities ( total disorder ) , by analogy with thermodynamics , it has been called information energy , although it does not have the dimension of energy.@xcite    it is seen from ( [ eq : equ12 ] ) that the greater the information energy , the more concentrated is the probability distribution , while the information content decreases . @xmath19 and information content are reciprocal ,",
    "hence one can define the quantity @xmath53 as a measure of the information content of a quantum system corresponding to onicescu s information energy .",

    "thus the product @xmath57 is dimensionless and can serve as a measure of concentration ( or information content ) of a quantum system .",
    "it is also seen from ( [ eq : equ12]),([eq : equ13 ] ) that @xmath19 increases as @xmath46 decreases ( or concentration increases ) and the information ( or uncertainty ) decreases .",
