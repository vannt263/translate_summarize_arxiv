    "twin - core nonlinear fibers and waveguides ( alias _ couplers _ ) have been a subject of considerable interest in nonlinear optics and , more generally , in nonlinear - wave theory since the pioneering works by jensen and maier @xcite , who introduced the model of a dual - core nonlinear optical fiber . in particular , many papers analyzed dynamics of solitary waves in models of nonlinear couplers ( see , e.g. , review @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite ) , although such solitons have not yet been created in the experiment .",
    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that a symmetric soliton in the model of the twin - core fiber , with its energy equally divided between the cores , becomes unstable when the energy exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "then , it was found that this instability gives rise to a _",
    "pitchfork bifurcation _ : a pair of new , stable _ asymmetric solitons _ ( which are mirror images to each other ) appear when the symmetric state loses its stability @xcite .",
    "this bifurcation was studied in detail by means of numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite methods ( the latter was based on the variational approximation , see section 6 of review @xcite ) , with a conclusion that the bifurcation is slightly _ subcritical _ , according to the standard definition bif .",
    "namely , new stable asymmetric states appear at a value of the soliton s energy which is slightly smaller than that at which the symmetric soliton becomes unstable , thus giving rise to the _ bistability _ ( coexistence of stable symmetric and asymmetric solitons ) in a narrow interval of energies before the pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "the studies of solitons in nonlinear dual - core systems were extended in various directions .",
    "first , the change of the character of the bifurcation was investigated in a practically interesting case of a dual - core nonlinear optical fiber with asymmetric cores @xcite .",
    "further , four - component solitons were considered in a more sophisticated model , which takes into regard two orthogonal polarizations of light in the dual - core fiber @xcite .",
    "then , bifurcations breaking the symmetry of two - component solitons were studied in a symmetric dual - core nonlinear fiber with the bragg grating carried by each core @xcite , and in a system of parallel - coupled waveguides with the quadratic , @xmath1 ( rather than cubic , @xmath2 ) , nonlinearity @xcite . in the two latter cases ,",
    "the symmetry - breaking bifurcation was found to be supercritical , rather then subcritical ( i.e. , the destabilization of the symmetric soliton immediately gives rise to a pair of stable asymmetric ones , without the bistability ) .",
    "in addition , three - component solitons and their bifurcations were studied in a system of three linearly - coupled fibers forming a triangular configuration @xcite , as well as in a similar configuration formed by three bragg gratings @xcite .",
    "a universal feature of all the above - mentioned systems is that the symmetric soliton is destabilized with the increase of its energy , as the self - focusing nonlinearity favors states in which a larger part of the energy is concentrated in one core ( which is explained by the fact that the part of the system s hamiltonian accounting for the nonlinearity tends to be lower in such an asymmetric configuration than in its symmetric counterpart ) .",
    "past the symmetry - breaking bifurcation point , the asymmetry of the energy distribution between the cores increases monotonously with the further increase of the total energy .    however , the self - focusing nonlinearity may feature saturation with the increase of the power in some optical media .",
    "in particular , it was inferred from experimental data that nonlinearity of chalcogenide glasses cqglass and some organic transparent materials @xcite is adequately approximated by adding a self - defocusing @xmath3 ( quintic ) term to the self - focusing @xmath2 one . the respective _ cubic - quintic _",
    "( cq ) nonlinearity furnishes a paradigmatic example of the saturation , as well as of the competition between self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "a model of a dual - core optical fiber or waveguide with saturable nonlinearity is an interesting object in its own right , and may also be relevant for applications to all - optical switching . in particular , the symmetry - breaking bifurcation between continuous - wave ( cw ) states ( rather than solitons ) in a model of a coupler with saturable nonlinearity was considered long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , with a conclusion that the bifurcation is subcritical in this case .",
    "however , cw states in couplers with a self - focusing nonlinearity are always subject to modulational instability @xcite , therefore it is necessary to consider solitons , rather than the cw .",
    "qualitatively new features may be expected in such systems . indeed , since the spontaneous symmetry breaking of soliton states , observed at energy exceeding the critical value ,",
    "is accounted for by the trend to concentrate a larger part of the energy in one core with the growing strength of the self - focusing , the saturation , which _ attenuates _ the self - focusing with the further increase of the energy , should eventually give rise to a reverse trend .",
    "reverse bifurcation _ may occur in the system , restabilizing the symmetric soliton and eliminating asymmetric states .",
    "this work aims is to produce a full picture of bifurcations in the symmetric dual - core system with the cq nonlinearity . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model , whose single free parameter is the constant @xmath0 of the linear coupling between the cores .",
    "main results are presented in section iii : if @xmath4 is smaller than a certain value @xmath5 , the system features a _",
    "bifurcation loop _ , first destabilizing and then restabilizing the symmetric soliton , as may be expected ( see above ) .",
    "the direct ( symmetry - breaking ) bifurcation is always supercritical , while the reverse one is subcritical ( featuring a large bistability region , which may be of considerable interest to applications @xcite - @xcite ) , except for a narrow interval near @xmath6 , where the reverse bifurcation is supercritical , without the bistability .",
    "the loop disappears at @xmath6 ; in the region of @xmath7 , the symmetric soliton is always stable , while asymmetric ones do not exist .",
    "direct simulations demonstrate that the stability of all soliton branches exactly complies with what may be expected from general principles of the bifurcation theory @xcite .    in section iv",
    ", we additionally investigate collisions between moving solitons , which a natural issue to address as the galilean invariance of the model allows one to generate moving solitons .",
    "we infer from simulations that collisions between stable symmetric solitons are completely elastic , while asymmetric solitons collide inelastically and separate after the collision in the form of breathers .",
    "conclusions are formulated in section v.",

    "when the reverse bifurcation is subcritical and , accordingly , the bifurcation loop is concave on its right side , two branches of asymmetric solutions ( one stable and one unstable ) meet and terminate at each turning point through the saddle - node ( alias tangent ) bifurcation ; accordingly , the branches of the asymmetric solitons which terminate at the reverse - bifurcation point are unstable .    these expectations are fully borne out by direct numerical simulations . in particular , the simulations clearly demonstrate that a small symmetry - breaking perturbation triggers spontaneous rearrangement of presumably unstable symmetric solitons into stable asymmetric ones .",

    ", the transition entails a larger radiative loss .",
    "the instabilities of symmetric and asymmetric solitons are qualitatively different : as said above , the symmetric solutions ( [ pushk ] ) are stable according to the vk criterion , i.e. , their instability may only be oscillatory [ accounted for by complex eigenvalue(s ) ] , which is indeed observed in the simulations ( the validity of the vk criterion was not proved for the present model , but it was rigorously derived for another system , including two linearly coupled equations with the cubic nonlinearity of opposite signs @xcite ) .",

    "the latter implies that the instability , being accounted for by a real eigenvalue , must grow without oscillations .",

    "the invariance suggests to study collisions between moving solitons ( collisions between symmetric and asymmetric solitons in the model of a coupler with the cubic nonlinearity were investigated in ref .",
    "scripta ) .",
    "simulations of the collisions make it possible to draw the following general conclusions .",
    "first , collisions between stable symmetric solitons ( which are obviously tantamount to collisions between solitons in the single - component nls equations with the cq nonlinearity ) appear to be completely elastic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ elastic - collision ] .",
    "the elastic collisions give rise to small shifts of the solitons centers , in the same fashion as in collisions between solitons in the integrable cubic nls equation ( each soliton is additionally shifted in the direction of its motion ) .    ) with @xmath80 , for @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( which correspond to @xmath83 ) . only the @xmath8-component is shown here , as the picture in the @xmath9-component is identical.,width=518 ]    second , collisions between stable asymmetric solitons are essentially _ inelastic_. in this case , the solitons emerge from the collision with smaller velocity @xmath84 , and in an excited state , i.e. , as _ breathers _ , rather than stationary solitons .",
    "for example , the ( inverse ) velocities of both solitons drop from @xmath85 before the collision to @xmath86 after the collision , if the moving solitons were generated by means of expression ( [ shove ] ) with @xmath87 , for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( which correspond to @xmath90 ) .    the breathers which appear after the inelastic collision are not persistent ones . as fig .",
    "[ breather ] shows , the amplitude of the intrinsic oscillations of the breather gradually decreases , while the oscillation period increases .",
    "this may imply that , in the course of subsequent extended evolution , the breathers will eventually relax to stationary solitons ( due to losses induced by emission of radiation ) , but detailed study of this stage of the evolution is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it is noteworthy that , while the solitons generally keep their identity after the inelastic collision ( the solitons which originally had a larger @xmath8- or @xmath9-component keep this difference after the collision ) , the post - collision oscillatory evolution clearly tends to _ symmetrize _ both pulses , so they may eventually settle down to a pare of identical symmetric solitons .    , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and shove parameters @xmath91 ( the second breather is a mirror image of the one shown here ) .",
    "the solid and dashed curves show the amplitudes of the @xmath8- and @xmath9-components of the breather.,width=518 ]",
    "in this work , we have extended the model of the nonlinear dual - core coupler by adding defocusing quintic nonlinearity to the usual cubic self - focusing term . in terms of optics",
    ", the model may be interpreted in temporal and spatial domains alike ( i.e. , in fiber couplers and in a pair of tunnel - coupled parallel planar waveguides ) . as a result , at not too large values of the linear - coupling parameter @xmath0",
    ", we observe a bifurcation loop for solitons : the supercritical bifurcation , which destabilizes the symmetric soliton and creates a pair of asymmetric ones , is followed by a reverse subcritical bifurcation that restores the stability of the symmetric soliton . in this case",
    ", the loop has the concave shape on its right side , and includes a large bistability region , which may be of interest for applications to all - optical switching . at larger values of @xmath0 , the loop s shape becomes convex , and",

    "@xmath0 , the symmetric solitons always remain stable , and asymmetric ones never appear .",
    "the stability of all the branches of the soliton states , verified by direct simulations , exactly complies with what may be predicted , on the basis of the shape of the bifurcation diagrams , by general principles of the bifurcation theory .",
    "additionally , in those cases when the asymmetric solitons are unstable , their instability is correctly predicted by the vakhitov - kolokolov criterion ( while the instability of symmetric solitons has a different nature , as they are unstable against oscillatory perturbations ) .",

    "unstable asymmetric solitons rearranged into their still more asymmetric stable counterparts .",
    "the galilean invariance of the model makes it possible to study collisions between moving solitons .",
    "symmetric solitons collide in a completely elastic fashion , while collisions between asymmetric solitons are inelastic : they lose , roughly , half of the velocity , and emerge from the collisions as breathers , that subsequently tend to symmetrize themselves and , possibly , settle down to stationary symmetric solitons .",
