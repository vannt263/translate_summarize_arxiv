    "on the basis of observations in various wavelength regions from radio to x - ray as well as theoretical considerations and simulations , it has been well established that dense cores in dark clouds are formation sites of low - mass stars .",
    "because dense cores have low kinetic temperature ( 10 k ) and high h@xmath3 density ( @xmath8 @xmath6 ) , they have been observed mainly with molecular lines .",
    "especially , extensive survey observations of nh@xmath2 by myers and his collaborators have greatly contributed to understanding of the physical property of dark cloud cores ( e.g. benson & myers 1989 ) .",
    "they found that 68 % of the dense cores observed by the nh@xmath2 lines ( `` nh@xmath2 cores '' ) accompany the _ iras _ sources , which are newly born stars in the cores ( benson & myers 1989 ; beichman et al . 1986 ) .",
    "therefore , it has been recognized that the nh@xmath2 lines are useful to study the physical properties of star - forming dense cores in dark clouds .    on the other hand , suzuki et al .",
    "( 1992 ) pointed out that nh@xmath2 is not always a good tracer of dense cores because of the chemical abundance variation from core to core .",
    "they carried out survey observations of ccs , hc@xmath2n , hc@xmath9n , and nh@xmath2 toward 49 dense cores and found that the spectra of carbon - chain molecules tend to be intense in starless cores , while those of nh@xmath2 tend to be intense in star forming cores .",
    "especially , suzuki et al . (",
    "1992 ) identified a few cores where the lines of carbon - chain molecules are intense while the nh@xmath2 lines are hardly detected , which are called `` carbon - chain - producing regions '' .",
    "they are l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , and the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 .",
    "recently , hirota , ikeda , & yamamoto ( 2001 ) reported that the deuterium fractionation ratios of dnc / hnc and dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 are significantly smaller in carbon - chain - producing regions than in the others",
    ". these systematic variation would reflect the difference in chemical evolutionary stages of the cores ; carbon - chain molecules and nh@xmath2 are abundant in relatively early and late stages , respectively ( suzuki et al .",
    "1992 ) and deuterium fractionation ratios increase as the core evolves ( hirota et al .",
    "2001 ; saito et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "although the dense cores identified by the nh@xmath2 lines have extensively been observed with various molecular lines , no systematic study has been carried out for the carbon - chain - producing regions except for tmc-1 ( e.g. olano , walmsley , & wilson 1988 ; hirahara et al .",
    "1992 ; pratap et al .",
    "detailed studies on the other carbon - chain - producing regions would be essential for understanding of chemical and physical evolution of dense cores . among them , l1521e in the taurus dark cloud complex ( d=140 pc ) is the most interesting source .",
    "it gives strong c@xmath10s and ccs lines , whereas only weak nh@xmath2 line has been detected so far .",
    "particularly the c@xmath10s emission is brightest among dense cores in our previous survey ( hirota et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this paper",
    ", we report the first comprehensive characterization of the chemical and physical properties of l1521e .",
    "the observed lines are summarized in table [ tab - observe ] .",
    "we took the reference position of l1521e to be ( @xmath11)= ( @xmath120717 ) , where the spectra of h@xmath0co@xmath1 , hn@xmath0c , ccs , and hc@xmath2n are found to be most intense . in the previous papers ( e.g. myers , linke , & benson 1983 ) ,",
    "several molecular lines were observed at the position which is 30  north from our reference position .",
    "the 45 ghz and 76 - 93 ghz lines were observed with the 45 m radio telescope at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) in several observing sessions from 1990 to 2000 .",
    "all of them were observed with sis mixer receivers whose system temperatures were about 200 - 500 k. the main - beam efficiencies ( @xmath13 ) were 0.7 and 0.5 for the 45 ghz and 76 - 93 ghz regions , respectively , and the beam sizes were 37  and 20 - 17  for the 45 ghz and 76 - 93 ghz regions , respectively .",
    "acousto - optical radio spectrometers with the frequency resolution of 37 khz were used for the backend .",
    "pointing was checked by observing a nearby sio maser source , nml - tau , every 1 - 2 hours , and the pointing accuracy was estimated to be better than 5 .",
    "all the observations were performed with the position - switching mode , in which a typical off position was 10   away from the source position .",
    "the 19 - 23 ghz lines were observed with the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope of max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie in 2000 may .",
    "we used cooled hemt receivers , whose system temperatures were about 30 k. the digital autocorrelators with the frequency resolution of 10 khz were used for the backend . for pointing and intensity calibrations , we observed 3c123 every 1 - 2 hours .",
    "we adopted a flux density of 3c123 to be 3.12 jy at 23780 mhz ( ott et al .",
    "observations were carried out with the frequency switching mode , in which the offset frequency was set to be 0.2 mhz .",
    "the @xmath14 lines of dnc and hn@xmath0c were observed with the nrao 12 m telescope at kitt peak in 1999 december .",
    "we used two sis mixer receivers and observed the dnc and hn@xmath0c lines simultaneously .",
    "the system temperature was about 400 k. the main - beam efficiency is derived from the observations of planets to be 0.7 for both lines .",
    "the hybrid spectrometers with the frequency resolution of 48.8 khz were used for the backend .",
    "we employed the position - switching mode as in the observations with the nro 45 m telescope .",
    "figure [ fig - maps ] shows the integrated intensity maps of h@xmath0co@xmath1 , hn@xmath0c , ccs , and hc@xmath2n in l1521e .",
    "it is clearly found that there exists a compact dense core traced by these lines , which has a single peak at the reference position with a structure elongated toward the east - west direction .",
    "the shape and peak position of these maps are similar to each other except for the slight difference in size , partly due to the difference in their critical density .",
    "there are neither signs of complex density variations nor of molecular abundance variations as seen in tmc-1 ( hirahara et al .",
    "1992 , pratap et al .",
    "the core size is derived to be 0.09 pc@xmath40.04 pc from the two dimensional gaussian fitting of the integrated intensity map of h@xmath0co@xmath1 .",
    "the peak position of these lines is close to that of the c@xmath15o line ( zhou et al .",
    "1994 ) , while the shape of the c@xmath15o distribution is different from the above maps probably due to the lower critical density of c@xmath15o .    figure [ fig - sp ] shows the spectra of nh@xmath2 ( @xmath16=1,1 ) and h@xmath0co@xmath1(@xmath17=1 - 0 ) observed toward the reference position .",
    "the peak brightness temperature of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 line is similar to those observed toward tmc-1 and other dense cores ( mizuno et al .",
    "1994 ) . in order to evaluate the h@xmath3 density",
    ", we carried out the statistical equilibrium calculation based on the lvg model ( goldreich & kwan 1974 ) for dnc and hn@xmath0c .",
    "the h@xmath3 density derived from the @xmath17=1 - 0 and @xmath17=2 - 1 lines of dnc is 4.5@xmath18 @xmath6 , which is consistent with the density derived from the @xmath17=1 - 0 and @xmath17=2 - 1 lines of hn@xmath0c ( 5.6@xmath18 @xmath6 ) .",
    "these values are close to that derived from @xmath17=1 - 0 and @xmath17=2 - 1 lines of c@xmath10s ( 1.3@xmath18 @xmath6 ; hirota et al .",
    "the h@xmath3 density of l1521e is comparable to those in other dense cores ( e.g. benson & myers 1989 ; hirota et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "although the h@xmath3 density is high enough to excite the inversion line of nh@xmath2(@xmath16=1,1 ) , it is found to be very faint toward the reference position of l1521e , as shown in figure [ fig - sp ] .",
    "since the distribution of nh@xmath2 is sometimes different from other molecules , we carried out the mapping observation of the nh@xmath2 line toward the 4@xmath44  region centered at the reference position with spatial resolution of 40 .",
    "however , the nh@xmath2 emission is generally weak over the entire core , and there is no other position where the nh@xmath2 line is more intense than in the reference position .",
    "the distributions of ccs and nh@xmath2 in l1521e seem to be different from those of the other starless cores previously observed , such as l1498 ( kuiper , langer , & velusamy 1996 ) and l1544 ( ohashi et al .",
    "1999 ; benson & myers 1989 ) . in these cores ,",
    "the distribution of ccs shows a shell - like structure , while that of nh@xmath2 is concentrated at the central position .",
    "such distributions can be interpreted qualitatively in terms of the chemical evolution ; ccs tends to be depleted at the center of chemically evolved cores , whereas nh@xmath2 becomes abundant there ( suzuki et al .",
    "1992 ; bergin & langer 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast to l1498 and l1544 , ccs is not depleted at the center of the core in l1521e , and nh@xmath2 is less abundant there .",
    "therefore , l1521e would be in the very early stage of its chemical evolution .",
    "it is notable that the core radius of l1521e , 0.031 pc , is significantly smaller than those of the other starless h@xmath0co@xmath1 cores , 0.049 - 0.129 pc , and is rather comparable to those of the star - forming cores , 0.026 - 0.033 pc ( mizuno et al . 1994 ) .",
    "mizuno et al . ( 1994 ) interpreted this systematic difference in terms of the physical evolution of dense cores ; star - forming cores are gravitationally more contracted than starless cores , and hence , the size of a dense part traced by the h@xmath0co@xmath1 line would decrease from starless cores to star - forming cores . however , the l1521e core is apparently an exception to this scenario , because it is undoubtedly a starless core in spite of its small size ; there are no _ iras _ point sources associated with l1521e .",
    "furthermore , the submillimeter continuum emission and the evidence of molecular outflows have never been reported for l1521e . according to lee , myers , & tafalla ( 1999 ) , the asymmetric line profile of cs(@xmath17=2 - 1 ) indicating the infalling motion has not been detected toward the l1521e core . considering the absence of intense nh@xmath2 emissions",
    ", it is rather likely that l1521e is in a very early stage of physical evolution ; the small size would indicate that l1521e is less evolved than the other starless cores , and hence , the high density region is still compact .",
    "the total mass of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 core of l1521e is evaluated to be 2.4 @xmath19 assuming the peak density and the core radius of 3@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 and 0.031 pc , respectively .",
    "the mass of the starless nh@xmath2 core ranges from 0.33 @xmath19 to 83 @xmath19 ( benson & myers 1989 ) , and hence , the mass of l1521e corresponds to the lower end of the above range .",
    "this is consistent with the above result that l1521e is a still growing core .",
    "the virial mass of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 core of l1521e is evaluated to be 2.8 @xmath19 assuming the kinetic temperature of 10 k , which indicates that the core of l1521e would be gravitationally bound . in the maps of the ccs and h@xmath0co@xmath1 lines ,",
    "significant velocity gradient of 2 km s@xmath20 pc@xmath20 is observed along the major axis ; the velocity increases from east to west .",
    "if this gradient is ascribed to the rotation about the minor axis , the mass supported by centrifugal force is estimated to be only 0.05 @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the centrifugal force may contribute to cloud support only partly , as in the case of the nh@xmath2 cores ( goodman et al .",
    "we derived the abundances of various molecules toward the reference position . for this purpose ,",
    "the line parameters for all the observed lines were determined by the gaussian fit , as summarized in table [ tab - observe ] .",
    "we ignored the unresolved hyperfine structures of the nh@xmath2 , hc@xmath2n , dnc , and hn@xmath0c lines , and hence , their linewidths are broader than the others .",
    "in addition to the intense spectra of ccs and hc@xmath2n , the longer carbon - chain molecules such as c@xmath2s , c@xmath21h , and hc@xmath9n are also detected at the reference position as shown in figure [ fig - spcc ] .",
    "therefore l1521e seems to be rich in carbon - chain molecules , as suzuki et al .",
    "( 1992 ) suggested .",
    "we calculated the column densities of observed molecules at the reference position of l1521e by the same method employed in hirahara et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and suzuki et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in order to compare the present results with those for the other dark cloud cores .",
    "we assumed the lte condition with the excitation temperatures of 6.5 k for nh@xmath2 , hc@xmath2n , and hc@xmath9n , 6.0 k for c@xmath21h , and 5.5 k for c@xmath2s , because only a single line was observed each for these species .",
    "for nh@xmath2 , all the ortho and para levels were assumed to be thermalized at the kinetic temperature of 10 k. on the other hand , we carried out the lvg calculations for dnc and hn@xmath0c .",
    "the column densities of dnc and hn@xmath0c are derived by using the @xmath17=1 - 0 and @xmath17=2 - 1 transitions in the present study , and hence , they are reduced by a factor of 2 - 3 from those reported by hirota et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , where the column density was determined only from the @xmath17=1 - 0 line with the assumption of the h@xmath3 density of 1.3@xmath18 @xmath6 .",
    "the derived column densities are summarized in table [ tab - colmn ] along with those of several molecules reported previously .",
    "it is important to estimate the optical depths of the observed lines , particularly for the nh@xmath2 ( 1 , 1 ) line .",
    "however , only the main hyperfine component was detected for the nh@xmath2 ( 1 , 1 ) line , so that we can not determine the optical depth from the intensity ratio of the hyperfine components . only the upper limit to the optical depth of the main hyperfine component can be estimated from the upper limit to the intensity of the strongest satellite component ( i.e. three times the rms noise ) to be 4.0 .",
    "however the upper limit of the excitation temperature is evaluated as low as 3.3 k in this case .",
    "this excitation temperature is significantly lower than those reported for other dark cloud cores ( 4.5 - 7.5 k ; suzuki et al .",
    "since the h@xmath3 density of l1521e ( ( 1.3 - 5.6)@xmath22 @xmath6 ) is enough high to excite the nh@xmath2 ( 1 , 1 ) line , the excitation temperature less than 3.3 k is unrealistic .",
    "when we assume the excitation temperature range from 4.5 k to 7.5 k observed toward other dark cloud cores , the column density determined ranges from 11.1@xmath23 @xmath24 to 6.7@xmath23 @xmath24 , whereas the optical depth ranges from 0.39 to 0.13 . therefore , the reason why the nh@xmath2 lines are hardly detected can be ascribed to the low column density .    in order to evaluate the fractional abundances of the observed molecules relative to h@xmath3 , we usually derive the column density of h@xmath3 from that of c@xmath15o because the fractional abundance of co and its isotopic species relative to h@xmath3 are well determined ( frerking , langer , & wilson 1982 ) .",
    "however , the distribution of c@xmath15o in l1521e seems to be different from those of the other molecular lines as discussed above ( zhou et al .",
    "1994 ) and hence , it is possible that the gas traced by the c@xmath15o line is not the same as those traced by the observed lines of the other species whose critical densities are higher than that of c@xmath15o .",
    "pratap et al . ( 1997 ) suggested this point in their detailed study on tmc-1 , and proposed to calculate the fractional abundances relative to hco@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we also follow their analysis and compared the fractional abundances relative to h@xmath0co@xmath1 between l1521e and tmc-1 .",
    "the column densities of carbon - chain molecules toward l1521e are significantly higher than the typical nh@xmath2 cores ( suzuki et al . 1992 ) . although the uncertainty of the calculated column densities are estimated to be a factor of a few mainly due to the assumed excitation temperature , the fractional abundances of c@xmath10s , ccs , and c@xmath2s relative to h@xmath0co@xmath1 in l1521e are comparable to or higher than those of tmc-1 , whereas those of longer carbon - chain molecules such as c@xmath21h , hc@xmath2n , and hc@xmath9n are lower by an order of magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the column density of nh@xmath2 in l1521e is 7.3@xmath25 @xmath24 which is apparently smaller by a factor of 10 than those in the typical nh@xmath2 cores ( benson & myers 1989 ; suzuki et al .",
    "1992 ) . in relation to this",
    ", we also found that the n@xmath3h@xmath1 line was not detected with the rms noise level of 0.2 k in l1521e , although it has been employed as a good tracer of dense cores ( lee et al .",
    "the upper limit of the column density of n@xmath3h@xmath1 is calculated by assuming the lte condition with the excitation temperature of 5.0 k ( benson , caselli , & myers 1998 ) and the fwhm linewidth of 0.5 km s@xmath20 .",
    "we found that the fractional abundance of n@xmath3h@xmath1 relative to h@xmath0co@xmath1 is at least smaller by a factor of 4 than that in the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 ( hirahara et al .",
    "1995 ) , and hence , n@xmath3h@xmath1 would also be exceptionally deficient in l1521e .",
    "these characteristic features on molecular abundances seem to be understood as follows .",
    "relatively high abundances of c@xmath7s in comparison with tmc-1 may indicate that the gas - phase abundance of the sulfur atom might be higher in l1521e than in tmc-1 and other dense cores .",
    "one possible reason is that the heavy atoms are not so depleted in l1521e .",
    "this could be possible if the l1521e core is in the very early phase of its physical evolution ( bergin & langer 1997 ) . in this case",
    ", the ionization degree would be enhanced , which gives an unfavorable condition for production of hc@xmath2n and hc@xmath9n , because the insertion reactions of the nitrogen atom to hydrocarbon ions compete with the electron recombination reactions .",
    "furthermore the high degree of ionization provides an additional unfavorable situation for deuterium fractionation , which is consistent with the extremely low dnc / hnc and dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 ratios observed in l1521e ( hirota et al .",
    "the low abundances of nh@xmath2 and n@xmath3h@xmath1 directly indicate the young age of the l1521e core , since these species are only abundant in the late stage of chemical evolution .    according to the physical properties and chemical abundances",
    ", l1521e could be a novel example of a very young core .",
    "further detailed observations of this and similar cores would be of particular importance for understanding the initial phase of star formation processes .",
