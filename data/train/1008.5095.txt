    "in the standard model(sm ) , neutrinos are strictly massless due to the accidental global @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "therefore , to explain the observed nonzero active neutrino masses , one needs to go beyond the sm to introduce new lepton number violating interaction .",
    "one famous mechanism to generate neutrino mass was proposed by zee@xcite thirty years ago .",
    "in addition to the sm higgs doublet @xmath3 , zee simply extended the scalar sector to include one more @xmath4 higgs doublet @xmath5 and an extra @xmath4 singlet charged higgs @xmath6 .",
    "there is no known principle to forbid the charged singlet higgs couples to the @xmath7 singlet formed by a pair of lepton doublets .",
    "the appropriate terms in the lagrangian are _ zee = -f^1_ab|_al _ 1 e_br - f^2_ab|_al _ 2 e_br - m_12 _ 1 i_2 _ 2 h^ * -f^h_ab",
    "i_2 _ bl h + h.c . , where @xmath8 are the generation indices , and all the rest are in standard notation .",
    "the higgs potential is omitted here because it is irrelevant to our present discussion .",
    "this lepton number violating coupling term @xmath9 is the key for generating the effective neutrino majorana masses .",
    "since the neutrinos do not receive tree level masses in this setup , the neutrino masses must be generated by radiative corrections .",
    "hence , the zee model provides a natural and economical explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "however , the flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) is a well known phenomenological problem in models with two higgs doublets .",
    "this consideration led wolfenstein to further assume that the coupling between the leptons and the higgs doublets conserves flavor by imposing a discrete symmetry that allows only @xmath3 to couple to the lepton , namely , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this simplified version is the so - called zee - wolfenstein model , and it has been studied extensively in the past thirty years@xcite . in addition , it has been shown that the zee - wolfenstein model is inconsistent with the accumulated neutrino experimental data .",
    "but it does nt mean the original version of the zee model is ruled out .",
    "it was found that it is still possible to accommodate the observed neutrino data when both higgs doublets are allowed to couple to the leptons@xcite . however , all these attempts suffer from having too many arbitrary parameters unknown complex yukawa coupling constants in the original zee model for three generations of fermions . ] and the fine tuning problem to avoid the persist fcnc .",
    "on the other hand , the possibility that there exists extra spacial dimensions has opened up an intriguing avenue to connect the fermion flavor problem with the fermion wave function profile in the extra dimension(s ) .",
    "the hierarchical yukawa couplings in 4d theories can be resulted from different level of the wave function overlap between the left - handed and the right - handed chiral fermions in extra dimension ( for recent studies along this line in the randall - sundrum model see @xcite ) . for simplicity",
    ", we choose the split fermion model@xcite to illustrate this idea . in the following",
    ", we shall show that by embedding the original zee model , without any right - handed neutrinos , into a 5d split fermion model , we are able to accommodate both the charged lepton and neutrino masses and the observed bi - large mixing angles , and a naturally suppressed fcnc as well with a handful of parameters and some simple orbifolding arrangements .",
    "we note by passing that the same method can be applied to any extra dimension model with nontrivial bulk fermion profiles .",
    "we now proceed to detail the model setup .",
    "the space - time of the model is described by an @xmath0 orbifold and the fifth dimensional coordinate is denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "the physical region is defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radius of the compactified extra spatial dimension . in the model",
    ", all the sm fields are propagating in the bulk whereas the fermions are localized in the fifth dimension with an unspecified potential .",
    "the orbifolding @xmath14 transforms @xmath15 , hence each bulk degree of freedom must be either even or odd under this @xmath14 .",
    "the first four ( fifth ) components of the sm gauge fields must be @xmath14-even(odd ) in order to reproduce the sm in low energy , and the bulk sm gauge fields can be spanned by either @xmath16 or @xmath17 with the proper normalization . for simplicity , we assume that all the sm chiral fermions are gaussian distributed in @xmath11 , and the width @xmath18 is universal . assuming that @xmath19 ( we set @xmath20 for our numerical study ) , the gaussian distribution can be normalized as ( y , c^l / r_i)= ( 2 ^ 2 ) ^1/4 , where @xmath21 is the location where the chiral split fermion peaks in the fifth dimension . since ( y , c_i ) * g*(y , c_j ) = ^2(y , ) , the hierarchical 4d yukawa couplings is attributed to the gaussian overlap between two chiral fermions .",
    "the overlap is exponentially suppressed as their relative distance @xmath22 .",
    "the further apart the two chiral fermions are the smaller their 4d yukawa .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the neutrino masses , the quark sector will be left out of our discussion . to distinguish from the 4d field",
    ", the bulk field will be denoted with a hat .",
    "as advertised , the 5d sm lepton doublet @xmath23 and lepton singlet @xmath24 can be expressed as the product of the 4d wave function and the gaussian profile in fifth dimension : @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the generation index .",
    "we also assume that the split fermions reside in a fat brane erected at the orbifold fixed point @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath29 , their kaluza - klein(kk ) modes are much heavier , @xmath30 , than those of the gauge and scalar bosons level by level and we shall not include them here .",
    "to enable the zee mechanism , there are two doublet scalar @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and a zee singlet @xmath33 propagating in the extra dimension as well .",
    "we assign the bulk scalar fields @xmath34 to be @xmath14-(even , odd , odd ) .",
    "the bulk scalar fields @xmath35 can be kk expanded in terms of @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , @xmath31 can be kk expanded by @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath37th kk mode has mass @xmath38 for both parities , where @xmath39 is the corresponding bulk mass parameter in the 5d lagrangian . by choosing the parity assignment",
    ", only @xmath31 has the zero mode , @xmath40 . and",
    "only @xmath40 can develop a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath41 , @xmath42 gev .",
    "the @xmath40 is identified as the sm higgs .",
    "its mass @xmath43 is unknown but believed to be less than or close to the electroweak scale @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to expect the remaining two bulk masses @xmath45 and @xmath46 are also in the same mass range as @xmath43 . as for the other physical higgs , their masses",
    "are all above @xmath47 tev ) .",
    "since only @xmath40 can contribute to fermion masses , the fermion yukawa couplings to @xmath40 is automatically diagonal after the mass diagonalization .",
    "then the dangerous fcnc will be only mediated by the kk excitations hence being suppressed compared to the usual two higgs doublets model ( 2hdm ) in 4d .",
    "a more subtle reason of choosing this parity assignment is that the profiles of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath48 , fall off near @xmath28 , which naturally results in a smaller 4d yukawa @xmath49 and @xmath50 . with an order one 5d yukawa couplings ,",
    "this miraculously makes neutrino masses roughly the desired order of magnitude without fine turning .    the relevant lagrangian for 5d zee model is given by _",
    "5dzee&= & - ^1_ab _ 1_br - ^2_ab _",

    "after integrating over @xmath11 and assuming that @xmath55 for @xmath19 , we obtain the effective 4d yukawa in the zee model as : f^1(n)_ab & & ( ) ^1-_n,0 ^ 1_ab , + f^2(n)_ab & & ^2_ab , + f^h(n)_ab & & ^h_ab , [ eq:4dyukawa ] where `` @xmath56 '' in the superscript labels the kk level .",
    "furthermore , there is a tower of cubic terms for the kk higgs in the effective 4d lagrangian , ^new_zee - 2r _ n , m=1^_n , m _",

    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath41 , the charged lepton mass matrix element can be read as ^e_ab = ^1_ab .",
    "assuming that all 5d yukawa couplings , @xmath59 , are of the same order , the charged lepton mass hierarchy becomes a problem of finding the solution of the split fermion peak locations @xmath60 in the fifth dimension .",
    "the mass matrix can be brought diagonal by a bi - unitary transformation , \\{m_e , m _ , m _ } = u_l^^e u_r . in the charged lepton mass basis ,",

    "[ fig:1loop]-(b ) , only the vev of @xmath67 contributes in the 5d version .",
    "another difference is that we need to sum up the contributions from all kk excitations in the 5d zee model . in practice",
    ", the kk summation shall be cut off at some large number before the effective theory treatment becomes invalid .",
    "we take the cutoff @xmath68 to be consistent with the approximation that the kk split fermions are ignored . however , the result is not very sensitive to the choice due to the @xmath69 dependence .",

    "the mixing between @xmath63 and @xmath64 is about @xmath71 of their mass square , @xmath72 , thus it can be ignored in calculating the loop diagram , fig .",

    "there is only one sm like neutral higgs below or at the electroweak scale due to the specific orbifold boundary condition we chose . around @xmath95 tev",
    ", there are 10 physical heavy higgs ( the first kk excitations of three kinds of scalars ) accompanying the appearance of four kk gauge bosons , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 as in any extra dimension model .",
    "the study of these kk excitations at collider depends on the model details and it is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "notice that replacing the electron current at the right hand side of fig.[fig : lfv](c ) by the initial state of @xmath98 ( for the lhc ) or @xmath99 ( for the linear collider ) leads to 1st kk gauge boson lfv decays .",
    "the branching ratio of lfv decay @xmath100 is proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "the kk gauge couplings @xmath102 and @xmath103 , given in eq.([eq : lfvgc ] ) , depend on the detailed split fermion configuration . however , because @xmath104 , so @xmath105 , the lfv branching ratios of the first kk photon and the first kk z are proportional to each other mode by mode .",
    "moreover , in the case that lfv is dominated by the first kk gauge boson , there is one interesting connection between the lfv decays of the first kk gauge boson @xmath106 , be it the @xmath107 or @xmath108 , and in the rare tau / muon decay : : br(v^(1 ) ) br(v^(1 ) e ) ~ br(3e)br(3e):br(3 ) br(3e ) .",
    "the reason is clear by looking at fig.[fig : lfv](c ) .",
    "taking the acceptance of cms and atlas into account , it is estimated to have roughly @xmath109 expected events of 1tev kk boson to be observed at the lhc with @xmath110 and @xmath111 luminosity@xcite .",
    "is due to the couplings of kk gauge boson . ]",
    "unfortunately , to satisfy the stringent bounds on muon / tau lfv decays , the lfv branching ratios of @xmath96 are found to be smaller then @xmath112 for all the 4 configurations . which basically makes the observation of lfv decay @xmath113 impossible at the lhc or the planned linear collider",
    "the zee model is a very economical extension of the sm to generate neutrino mass without the presence of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "however , the original model in the 4d spacetime faces two major difficulties : the tree - level fcnc mediated by electroweak higgs and too many arbitrary yukawa . in this work",
    ", we study the zee model in a 5d split fermions scenario where each sm chiral fermion has a gaussian profile localized in the @xmath114 orbifold , with a compactification radius @xmath13 . for simplicity ,",
    "all split fermions profile in 5d are assumed to have a common width @xmath115 .",
    "the sm @xmath4 and @xmath116 gauge fields and all the three higgs fields in the zee model are now propagating in the fifth dimension .",
    "the second higgs doublet and the zee singlet are assigned to be odd under @xmath14 orbifolding , such that their zero modes are projected out .",
    "only the first higgs doublet ( whose zero mode is identified as the sm higgs ) can develop vev to give charged fermion masses and break the sm electroweak symmetry .",
    "we assume that all the 5d yukawa couplings are complex number with arbitrary phase and their absolute values of order one . with only 9 important parameters ( @xmath117 and six split fermion locations ) , we are able to accommodate the three charged lepton masses and all observed neutrino data simultaneously without much fine tuning .",
    "this largely reduces the number of unknown parameters ( mostly yukawa ) in the 4d version .",
    "it is highly nontrivial that such kind of solutions exist in this model .",
    "for instance , when the zee model is embedded in an @xmath118 gut model@xcite , no viable solution in the split fermion scenario has been found .    whether the neutrino mass of normal hierarchy type can be accommodated in this model",
    "is not clear to us .",
    "however , only the solutions for neutrino mass of inverted hierarchy type were found in our numerical study so far . in all of the four representative configurations , nonzero @xmath1 and the effective neutrino mass @xmath119ev",
    "were predicted . which may be probed at the planned reactor neutrino experiments and the @xmath120 experiments with few tons of isotope .",
    "below the electroweak scale , the sm higgs coupling is flavor diagonal thus no fcnc processes at tree level . in this model ,",
    "the lfv processes are dominated by the tree level diagrams mediated by first kk gauge boson @xmath106 ( be it the photon or the @xmath121 ) , which are suppressed compared to the 4d version due to ( 1 ) the heavy mass ( @xmath122 tev ) and ( 2 ) the narrow width of the gaussian distribution of split fermions .",
    "we find no pattern in the lfv rare tau or muon decay channels . instead ,",
    "once been measured , the relative magnitude amount branching ratios can be used to tell which configuration is preferred by the nature .",
    "the direct signal of extra dimension will be the discovery of the kk excitations of gauge bosons or scalars at the high energy colliders .",
    "however , in the foreseeable future , it is more promising to study the lepton flavor physics in the lfv rare tau / muon decays for this model .    in all",
    ", this model provides a natural and economical setup for generating neutrino masses through the zee mechanism with ( 1 ) a small number of free parameters , ( 2 ) the hierarchical 4d yukawa couplings , ( 3 ) the absence of the tree - level fcnc at low energy , @xmath123 , and the naturally heavy exotic particles .",
    "it also demonstrates a geometrical alternative to accommodate the observed pattern in lepton masses and mixings without any flavor symmetry involved .",
    "although the split fermion model with a universal gaussian width is rather ad hoc , we believe the idea presented in this work can be applied to other higher - dimensional models without major difficulties .",

    "<S> we study the zee model in the framework of the split fermion model in @xmath0 spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino masses are generated through 1-loop diagrams without the right - handed neutrinos introduced . by assuming an order one anarchical complex 5d yukawa couplings , all the effective 4d yukawa couplings are determined by the wave function overlap between the split fermions and the bulk scalars in the fifth dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the predictability of the yukawa couplings is in sharp contrast to the original zee model in 4d where the yukawa couplings are unknown free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this setup exhibits a geometrical alternative to the lepton flavor symmetry . by giving four explicit sets of the split fermion locations , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that it is possible to simultaneously fit the lepton masses and neutrino oscillation data by just a handful free parameters without much fine tuning . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we are able to make definite predictions for the mixing angle @xmath1 , the absolute neutrino masses , and the lepton flavor violation processes for each configuration . </S>"
