    "do black holes interact with an accretion flow in such a way so a distinct observational signature entirely different from those associated with any other compact object exists ?",
    "in other words can the existence of a black hole be solely inferred from the radiation observed at infinity ?",
    "these are the crucial questions where theoreticians and observers are confronting nowadays . even though there have been now accumulated the enormous observational evidences in favor of the existence of black holes still it is fair to say that their existence has not been established . perhaps the proof their existence would have been a much easier task if , for instance , an argument would have been advanced , which would : a ) single out the generic component ( or components ) of a black hole which is responsible for shaping up the unique observed feature associated with black holes    \\b ) prove that indeed this generic component always results in the same observable feature independent of the environmental conditions that the black hole finds itself .",
    "the luck of such an argument may be traced in the plethora of various accretion flows : accretion in a state of free fall , optically thin or optically thick , accretion disks with or without relativistic corrections , shocked flows _ etc .",
    "_ of course , this diversity of accretion models is highly justified . on physical grounds",
    "one expects accretion flows describing a solar - mass black hole accreting interstellar medium to be distinct from those flows describing accretion onto a black hole in a close binary system or from a supermassive black hole at the center of an agn .",
    "viewed from this angle , the detectability of a black hole appears to be a rather frustrating issue since it is not clear a priori what type of the existing accretion models ( if any ) would describe a realistic accreting black hole .",
    "in the present paper we shall show that may be not the case .",
    "the distinct feature of black hole spacetime , as opposed to the spacetimes due to other compact objects is the presence of the event horizon . near the horizon",
    "the strong gravitational field is expected to dominate the pressure forces and thus to drive the accreting material into a free fall .",
    "in contrast , for other compact objects the pressure forces are becoming dominant as their surface is approached , and thus free fall state is absent .",
    "we argue that this difference is rather crucial , resulting in an observational signature of a black hole . roughly , the origin of this signature is due to the inverse comptonization of low energy photons from fast moving electrons .",
    "the presence of the low - energy photon component is expected to be generic due , for instance , to the disk structure near a black hole or to bremstrahlung of the electron component from the corresponding proton one .",
    "the boosted photon component is characterized by a power law spectrum , and is entirely independent of the initial spectrum of the low - energy photons .",
    "the spectral index of the boosted photons is determined by the mass accretion rate and the bulk motion plasma temperature only . a key ingredient in proving our claim is the employment of the exact relativistic transfer describing the compton scattering of the low - energy radiation field of the maxwellian distribution of fast moving electrons .",
    "we will prove that the power law is always present as a part of the black hole spectrum in a wide energy range .",
    "we investigate the particular case of a non - rotating schwartzchild black hole powering the accretion , leaving the case of a rotating black hole for the future analysis .",
    "the presence of the power law part in the upcomptonized spectra was rigorously proven by titarchuk & lyubarskij 1995 ( hereafter tl95 ) .",
    "there it has been demonstrated that for the wide class of the electron distributions the power law is the solution of the full kinetic equation .",
    "the importance of compton upscattering of low - frequency photons in an optically thick , converging flow has been understood for a long time .",
    "blandford and payne were the first to address this problem in a series of papers ( blandford & payne 1981 and payne & blandford 1981 ) .",
    "in the first paper they derived the fokker - planck radiative transfer equation which took into account photon diffusion in space and energy , while in the second paper they solved the fokker - planck radiative transfer equation in the case of the steady state , spherically symmetric , super - critical accretion into a central black hole with the assumption of a power - law flow velocity @xmath0 and neglecting thermal comptonization . for the inner boundary condition they assumed adiabatic compression of photons as @xmath1 .",
    "thus , their flow extended from @xmath2 to infinity .",
    "they showed that all emergent spectra have a high - energy , power - law tail with index @xmath3 ( for free fall @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , which is independent of the low - frequency source distribution .",
    "titarchuk , mastichiadis & kylafis ( 1996 ) paper ( hereafter tmk96 and see also the extended version in tmk97 ) presents the exact numerical and approximate analytical solutions of the problem of spectral formation in a converging flow , taking into account the inner boundary condition , the dynamical effects of the free fall , and the thermal motion of the electrons .",
    "the inner boundary has been taken at _",
    "finite _ radius with the spherical surface being considered as a fully absorptive .",
    "titarchuk , mastichiadis & kylafis ( 1996 ) have used a variant of the fokker - plank formalism where the inner boundary mimics a black - hole horizon ; no relativistic effects ( special or general ) are taken into account .",
    "thus their results are instructively useful but they are not directly comparable with the observations . _ by using the numerical and analytical techniques they demonstrated that the extended power laws are present in the resulting spectra in addition to the blackbody like emission at lower energies . _",
    "zane , turrola , nobilli & erna ( 1996 ) presented a characteristic method and the code for solving the radiative transfer equation in differentially moving media in a curved spacetime .",
    "some applications , concerning hot and cold accretion onto nonrotating black holes were discussed there .    in our paper the full relativistic treatment is worked out in terms of the relativistic boltzmann kinetic equation without recourse to the fokker - planck approximation in either configuration and energy space .",
    "the relativistic transport theory was developed by lindquist ( 1966 ) .",
    "he presents the appropriate radiative transfer in the curve spacetime . for completeness of our paper",
    "we delineate some important points of that theory related with the application to the radiative transfer in the electron atmosphere .",
    "we demonstrate that the power - law spectra are produced when low - frequency photons are scattered in the thomson regime ( i.e. when the dimensionless photon energy @xmath6 measured in the electron rest frame satisfies @xmath7 ) .",
    "the eigenfunction method for the comptonization problem employed in this paper has been offered and developed by titarchuk & lyubarskij 1995 ( hereafter tl95 ) .",
    "giesler & kirk 1997 have extended the tl95 treatment by accommodating an arbitrary anisotropy of the source function .",
    "their results for the spectral index confirm those of tl95 over a wide range of electron temperature and optical depth ; the largest difference they found is 10% , occurring at low optical depth .",
    "the spectral indices related with the eigenvalues of the problem are determined as functions of the optical depth of the accreting matter .",
    "thus , for the first time we are able to solve the full comptonization problem in the presence of the bulk and thermal motions of electrons .    in",
    "  2 and appendix a we will give the details of the derivation of the general relativistic radiative kinetic equation .",
    "section 3 ( and some details in the appendix b ) presents the method .",
    "we describe the method of separation of variables , and the reduction of the whole problem to the specific eigen - problem in the configuration space .",
    "we propose the numerical solution of this problem by using the iteration method ( e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk 1985 ) with integrating over characteristics ( the photon trajectories in the presence of schwarzschild black hole background ) .",
    "finally , we summarize our work and draw conclusions in  4 .",
    "we begin with considering , background geometry , described by the following line element : @xmath8 where , for the schwarzschild black hole , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the event coordinates with @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the gravitational constant and @xmath14 is the mass of a black hole .    in order to describe the photon radiation field",
    "we shall employ the concept of the distribution function @xmath15 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath16 describes the number @xmath17 of photons ( photon world lines ) which cross a certain spacelike volume element @xmath18 at @xmath19 , and whose @xmath20 momenta @xmath21 lie within a corresponding 3-surface element @xmath22 in momentum space .",
    "it is desirable to choose @xmath18 and @xmath22 to be coordinate - invariants .",
    "thus @xmath17 would be invariant as well and the same would be true of @xmath16 .    in appendix",
    "a we present the detailed derivation of the relativistic radiative transfer equation expressed through the distribution function @xmath16 and the interaction density function @xmath23 ( see the definition of this function after eq .",

    "one has to interpret @xmath26 similar to the one implied by ( a8 ) , with the sole exception that considerations are restricted on the electron phase space . for our purpose an arbitrary electron momentum state @xmath27",
    ", can be represented in the form :    @xmath28 where the `` the thermal three velocity '' @xmath29 stands for a convenient parameterization of the electron phase space .",

    "when local minskowian coordinates are used , with @xmath198 tangent to the respective coordinate lines , this reduces to the familiar lorentz invariant @xmath206surface element in the momentum space , @xmath207 ( e.g. landau & lifshitz 1971 ) .",
    "if we introduce in the zero - shell spherical coordinates @xmath208 defined ( in a local minkowski frame ) through relationships @xmath209 where @xmath210 is a photon energy , then we obtain @xmath211 in any coordinate system one can introduce the invariant infinitesimal volume element over the photon space , erected above the space time point under consideration . in other words",

    "the alteration depends upon the specific interaction the photon field is subjected to . in accordance with the relativistic form of liouville s theorem ( e.g. lindquist 1966 ) @xmath224 remains invariant along the given set of trajectories .",
    "hence the change in the number of world lines within @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is some parameter changing along geodesics ( landau & lifshitz 1971 ) , is @xmath227 which is simply proportional to the change in @xmath15 .",

    "one can introduce the transformation which leaves the coordinate system unaltered , but express vectors in terms of their tetrad components , namely @xmath240 @xmath241 by using this transformation the radiative transfer equation can be rewritten in the form , which is very similar to eq .",
