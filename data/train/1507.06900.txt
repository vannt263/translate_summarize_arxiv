    ". the bistochastic maps are exactly the convex combinations of permutations ; therefore , @xmath6 is a random mixture of reshufflings of @xmath7 and in this sense _ more disordered _ than @xmath7 .",
    "since disorder and entropy are recurrent themes in thermodynamics , it comes as no surprise that majorization plays a major role there as well .",
    "in particular , bistochastic maps and the majorization relation have been shown to determine the thermodynamically allowed state transitions of systems out of equilibrium in the absence of energy constraints  @xcite .",
    "similarly , majorization has been shown to determine the interconvertibility of entangled pure quantum states by local operations and classical communication  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , these applications have led to the study of majorization in the context of joint distributions of several random variables , in particular product distributions  @xcite .",

    "the interplay of the states of _ several _ physical systems is of obvious interest , with the intuition that sometimes the presence of one physical system ( say , a battery ) can help to perform state transitions on another physical system ( say , a laser pointer ) .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a multipartite notion of majorization which is meant to elucidate the relation between _ disorder and correlation_. in a nutshell , while majorization determines whether a transformation @xmath8 is possible via bistochastic maps , we study transformations of the form @xmath9 which map @xmath7 to @xmath6 , but at the same time correlate @xmath10 auxiliary systems without changing their marginals . here , @xmath11 denotes the kronecker product , i.e.  @xmath12 is a product distribution on two systems ; @xmath13 denotes a joint probability distribution on @xmath10 systems , with marginals @xmath14 . given two distributions @xmath7 and @xmath6 , we ask whether there exists some @xmath15 and @xmath13 such that transition  ( [ eqtransition ] ) is possible via some bistochastic map .",
    "we can also fix a given value of @xmath10 , in which case  ( [ eqtransition ] ) generalizes the notions of majorization @xmath16 and _ trumping _",

    "furthermore , we explain how the results fit into the context of previous research on majorization and characterizations of entropy , and explain some results and open problems related to the value of @xmath10 in  ( [ eqtransition ] ) . in section  [ secproofthemain ] , we give a proof of theorem  [ themain ] , which is accomplished by construction of a suitable auxiliary distribution @xmath13 ( however , with several non - trivial twists ) .",

    "if @xmath60 and @xmath61 , then , strictly speaking , a transition of the form  ( [ eqtransition ] ) is impossible . in this case , however , one can find full - rank approximations @xmath62 that are arbitrarily close to @xmath6 and that satisfy @xmath63 , such that  ( [ eqctrumping ] ) holds for @xmath6 replaced by @xmath62 , allowing to obtain @xmath6 to arbitrary accuracy from @xmath7 via transitions of the form  ( [ eqtransition ] ) .",
    "we now discuss the special cases of  ( [ eqctrumping ] ) for different values of @xmath10 , summarized also in table  [ tablemaj ] .    if @xmath59 , then  ( [ eqctrumping ] ) reduces to majorization itself . if we demand that  ( [ eqctrumping ] ) holds for @xmath64 , we ask for some distribution @xmath65 such that @xmath66 this notion has been introduced in entanglement theory  @xcite and is called",

    "the interpretation is similar to a catalyst in chemistry : it enables transitions @xmath8 that are impossible without its presence , but it is not consumed and can be reused after the process .",
    "motivated by this nomenclature , we call our new relation _ correlated trumping _ , or _ c - trumping _ and say that _",

    "] an example of c - trumping with @xmath71 auxiliary systems can be found in  @xcite , though in a more general framework in which systems are allowed to carry hamiltonians ( energy ) . using the construction of theorem 3 in the supplemental material of  @xcite",

    "for any two given distributions @xmath36 , one can check directly whether @xmath58 by using the definition of majorization , ( [ eqdefmaj ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the trumping relation @xmath67 is defined implicitly via the existence of a catalyst @xmath65 satisfying  ( [ eqtrumping ] ) which can not be checked directly .",
    "thus , it has been an open problem for some time to give necessary and sufficient conditions that allow one to decide whether or not @xmath67 holds .",
    "this problem has been settled in the works of klimesh  @xcite and turgut  @xcite .",
    "to understand their criterion , we need to define the rnyi and burg entropies which will play a major role later on in the proofs as well . for probability distributions @xmath46 and real parameters @xmath79 , we define the _ rnyi entropy of order @xmath80 _ as @xmath81 furthermore , we set @xmath82 this choice of definition ensures continuity of @xmath72 in @xmath80 except at @xmath83 , in the sense that @xmath84 however , @xmath85 exists only if @xmath7 has `` full rank '' , i.e.  @xmath86 , in which case it equals @xmath87 .",
    "the burg entropy  @xcite is defined as @xmath88 sometimes different conventions are used in the literature  @xcite ; the prefactor @xmath89 ensures that @xmath90 is additive , i.e.  @xmath91 .",

    ". then @xmath67 if and only if @xmath96    thus , fixing different values of @xmath10 in  ( [ eqctrumping ] ) naturally gives rise to different notions of entropy that characterize the corresponding relations .",
    "a summary is shown in table  [ tablemaj ] . given some relation @xmath97 on the probability distributions , we say that a real function @xmath98 is a _ monotone _ if @xmath99 .",
    "a set of monotones @xmath100 will be called _ complete _ for the relation @xmath97 if @xmath101 for all @xmath102 implies that @xmath103 ( whether one would like to have strict or rather non - strict inequality , @xmath104 , may depend on the context , and does so in table  [ tablemaj ] ) .",
    "thus , lemma  [ lemtrumping ] can be understood as saying that the rnyi and burg entropies constitute a complete set of monotones for the trumping relation .",
    "similarly , theorem  [ themain ] says that the shannon and hartley entropies are a complete set of monotones for c - trumping .",
    "our second result is an immediate consequence of theorem  [ themain ] . as mentioned above ,",

    "schur concavity of @xmath98 means that @xmath5 for some bistochastic map @xmath4 implies @xmath121 , which is a property that one would intuitively expect from any `` measure of disorder '' .",

    "first , the cases of burg entropy and rnyi entropy for @xmath92 can be ignored .",

    "the rest of the argumentation remains unchanged , proving the statement of the lemma also for the case that @xmath7 does not have full rank .",
    "the previous two lemmas have made use of the following basic result , which is a simple consequence of dini s theorem .    [ lemdini ]",

    "but in this case , dini s theorem proves that the convergence @xmath322 is uniform , hence with @xmath323 there is some @xmath147 such that @xmath324 and therefore @xmath319 for all @xmath317 and @xmath150 .",

    "clearly the extension @xmath149 given in that lemma has full rank , but is not a uniform distribution .",
    "therefore , we can apply lemma  [ lempart2 ] to the two distributions @xmath331 and @xmath149 , and obtain the existence of an extension @xmath332 ( introducing a third system @xmath202 ) of @xmath149 such that @xmath333 by definition of trumping , there is an additional system @xmath334 and a catalyst ( probability distribution ) @xmath335 on @xmath334 such that @xmath336 since the majorization relation is preserved under the tensor product with another probability distribution , we obtain @xmath337 where @xmath338 is another copy of @xmath6 ( note however that @xmath234 and @xmath339 are in general _ not _ copies of @xmath329 ) .",

    "now we are ready to prove our main result , theorem  [ themain ] .",

    "so if we had @xmath60 then @xmath350 , or @xmath67 .",
    "but then lemma  [ lemtrumping ] ( possibly after removing common zeros from @xmath7 and @xmath6 as in the following paragraph below ) would prove that @xmath18 , which is a contradiction .",

    "similarly as for catalytic majorization  @xcite , it is easy to show that auxiliary distributions @xmath365 which are either fully mixed ( i.e.  equal to @xmath366 for some @xmath161 ) or pure ( i.e.  contain only zeros and ones ) are useless ; they can be removed without altering the c - trumping relation . in other words",
    ", we may assume that every auxiliary system @xmath367 appearing in  ( [ eqctrumping ] ) has shannon entropy strictly positive and strictly less than @xmath368 .",
    "it is obvious that every function @xmath107 of the form  ( [ eqform ] ) is continuous and has properties ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "it remains to show that converse ; so suppose that @xmath98 is a continuous real function on @xmath120 that has properties ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) .",
    "use the notation @xmath369 and define the `` negentropies '' for all @xmath370 , @xmath133 , as @xmath371 we claim that @xmath372 is non - negative .",
    "this can be seen from a simple argument which , for notational reasons , we give only for @xmath373 , but which obviously works for all @xmath374 .",
    "using additivity , symmetry , and subadditivity ( recalling our matrix notation for bipartite distributions ) , we obtain @xmath375 hence @xmath376 , and in general @xmath377 for all @xmath370 by the same argument",
    ".    we will now show that @xmath98 is schur - concave .",
    "suppose that @xmath378 satisfy @xmath379 ( implying in particular that these distributions have the same number of entries ) .",

    ". this proves  ( [ eqmonotonicity1 ] ) . if @xmath402 then we have  ( [ eqmonotonicity1 ] ) in both directions , hence @xmath403 .",

    ", this function @xmath408 is increasing .",
    "if @xmath409 , let @xmath108 be distributions with @xmath410 and @xmath411 , then @xmath412 thus , @xmath408 is an additive monotone function , and it is well - known ( and easy to check ) that all functions of this kind are linear . hence there is a constant @xmath413 such that @xmath414 , and this constant can not be negative due to  ( [ eqmonotonicity1 ] ) .",
    "recalling the definition  ( [ eqdefinition ] ) , we get for @xmath370 @xmath415 and from @xmath416 is is easy to check that @xmath119 .",
    "a few comments are in place regarding the statement of this corollary .",
    "note that the additivity property @xmath119 for the dimension - dependent constants does not automatically imply that @xmath417 for some constant @xmath418 . while this is a possible choice of @xmath419 , there are other choices , and one needs additional assumptions to conclude that @xmath419 is a logarithm , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that hartley entropy @xmath94 is symmetric , additive , and subadditive .",
    "however , if @xmath420 , i.e.  @xmath7 does not contain zeros , then @xmath421 , i.e.  a dimension - dependent constant , which is covered by our theorem .    from the structure of the proof , one can conclude that the actual mathematically `` natural '' quantity is not shannon entropy @xmath0 itself , but negentropy @xmath422 ( for @xmath420 ) .",
    "this resembles the fact that @xmath423 ( and not @xmath0 ) turns out to be the relevant quantity to describe the amount of extractable work in many situations in thermodynamics , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that the rnyi entropies @xmath72 and the burg entropy @xmath90 are continuous , symmetric , and additive , and so are non - negative ( discrete or continuous ) linear combinations of them .",
    "it is therefore natural to conjecture that these are the only real functions on @xmath120 that satisfy the analog of corollary  [ corcharacterization ] if the assumption of subadditivity ( ii ) is dropped .",
    "this conjecture resembles example 7.10 in  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the methods of this paper allow to contribute in any way to a resolution of this conjecture .",
    "we have introduced a new relation on the finite discrete probability distributions , called _ c - trumping _ , which is part of a series of natural generalizations of the notions of majorization and trumping as studied in quantum information theory .",
    "it is meant to elucidate the relation between correlation and disorder , and turns out to be completely characterized by shannon entropy @xmath0 .",
    "we have also shown that this insight can be used to obtain a very simple proof of a weaker version of aczl et al.s characterization result  @xcite .",
    "it has been noted before that the notion of trumping , or catalysis , is very sensitive to the detailed requirements on how the catalysts are retained in the end .",
    "for example , if  ( [ eqtrumping ] ) is replaced by the weaker condition that @xmath424 , where @xmath425 is @xmath426-close in variation distance to @xmath65 for some fixed @xmath380 , then _ all _ transitions from any @xmath7 to any @xmath6 become possible , and the resulting relation becomes trivial .",
    "this phenomenon has been called _ embezzling _ in the context of entanglement theory  @xcite and thermodynamics  @xcite . if one demands that the variation distance is smaller than @xmath426 _ divided by the logarithm of the catalyst dimension _",
    ", then it turns out that the shannon entropy @xmath0 determines the allowed transitions  @xcite , which is somewhat similar to our result .",
    "so can theorem  [ themain ] be interpreted as an instance of embezzling ?",
    "we do not think so .",
    "note that we demand that the auxiliary systems @xmath14 preserve their local states exactly .",
    "more generally , while it has been argued in  @xcite that `` closeness in variation distance '' is simply not a physically meaningful requirement , we think that `` local preservation of the auxiliary distributions '' is a physically well - motivated condition : restrictions on transformations in physics usually arise from conservation laws .",
    "but in most situations , conserved quantities ( like energy or angular momentum ) are sums of local quantities as long as interaction terms can be neglected . in this sense , our result says in what way we can exploit auxiliary systems as resources , if these systems are forced to preserve their local states due to local conservation laws .",
    "if local states _ are _ allowed to change , then physical intuition expects these systems to thermalize ; in the context of majorization , this amounts to getting closer to the uniform distribution .",
    "this paper can be interpreted as studying the complementary situation in which local states are forced to be fixed .",
    "theorem  [ themain ] then gives a classification of what is possible in this regime , and suggests that there might be some situations of this kind in physics where correlations build up spontaneously .",
    "the c - trumping relation represents a special instance of a more general problem : instead of asking whether a given distribution @xmath7 can be transformed into another distribution @xmath6 by some bistochastic map , we can ask whether this is possible if some additional resources are consumed or produced during the transformation .",
    "more formally , think of some set of input auxiliary distributions @xmath427 , and to every @xmath428 a corresponding set of output distributions @xmath429 .",
    "we may then ask whether there exist auxiliary distributions @xmath428 and @xmath430 such that @xmath424 . if @xmath65 is in some sense `` more valuable '' than @xmath425 , then the transition @xmath8 can be accomplished at the cost of some auxiliary resource ; otherwise we have a resource yield .",
    "while this formulation represents a simplification of the general idea of a resource theory  @xcite , it may already lead to non - trivial but mathematically tractable relations on probability distributions , with in some cases interesting consequences for thermodynamics .    in the case of c - trumping",
    ", @xmath427 is the set of product distributions , @xmath429 is the set of multipartite distributions that have the same marginals as @xmath428 , and transitions involve a cost of stochastic independence .",
    "a different example is given by the notion of _ lambda - majorization _ that has been introduced in  @xcite to calculate the work cost of arbitrary processes such as landauer erasure .",
    "they study transitions of the form @xmath431 via bistochastic maps , where @xmath432 is a `` pure bit '' , and @xmath433 . given @xmath7 and @xmath6 of identical size , they ask for the maximal @xmath434 over all @xmath23 ( arbitrary number of `` auxiliary bits '' ) such that a transition of this form is possible , i.e.  the left - hand side majorizes the right - hand side .",
    "this is interpreted as extraction of work proportional to @xmath435 by resorting to landauer s principle . in our formalism",
    ", we can fix @xmath436 , define @xmath427 as the set of all distributions @xmath437 with arbitrary @xmath438 , @xmath439 , and @xmath440 as the set of all distributions of the form @xmath441 . this way",
    ", our formalism expresses the question whether work extraction proportional to the given value of @xmath435 is possible .    as the results in this paper indicate",
    ", the study of generalized majorization relations of this kind may lead to surprising insights into the `` usefulness '' of information - theoretic properties .",
    "this contributes to the general question how different kinds of knowledge ( represented by probability distributions ) can be `` put to work '' via interconversion , and in what way this is expressed by the values of entropy - like quantities .",
    "clearly , this kind of reasoning is not restricted to classical probability distributions , but can applied to quantum states as well , which are the main subject of interest in quantum thermodynamics .",
    "we are grateful to matteo lostaglio , jonathan oppenheim , and manfred salmhofer for discussions .",
