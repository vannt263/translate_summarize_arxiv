    "<S> using a stochastic nonlinear phase oscillator model , we study the effect of event - triggered feedback on the statistics of interevent intervals . </S>",
    "<S> events are associated with the entering of a new cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback is modeled by an instantaneous increase ( positive feedback ) or decrease ( negative feedback ) of the oscillators frequency , whenever an event occurs followed by an exponential decay on a slow timescale . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous works , we also consider positive feedback that leads to various novel effects . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , besides the known excitable and oscillatory regime , that are separated by a saddle - node on invariant circle bifurcation , positive feedback can lead to bistable dynamics and a change of the system s excitability . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback has also a strong effect on noise - induced phenomena like coherence resonance or anti - coherence resonance . </S>",
    "<S> both positive and negative feedback can lead to more regular output for particular noise strengths . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate serial correlation in the sequence of interevent intervals that occur due to the additional slow dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we derive approximations for the serial correlation coefficient and show that positive feedback results in extended positive interval correlations whereas negative feedback yields short - ranging negative correlations . investigating the interplay of feedback and the nonlinear phase dynamics close to the bifurcation </S>",
    "<S> , we find that correlations are most pronounced for an optimal feedback strengths . </S>"
