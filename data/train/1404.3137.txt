    "one of the main goals of nanoengineering and quantum optics is the development of nanodevices that reliably process quantum information .",
    "a basic requirement for these quantum information processing devices is the ability to universally control the state of a single qubit on timescales much shorter than the coherence time .",
    "promising candidates have been studied experimentally , for instance , in superconducting qubits @xcite , quantum - dot charge qubits @xcite , and in cavity qed @xcite . as in all technological applications",
    "the natural question arises how these devices can be operated `` optimally '' .    in this context ,",
    "an important question in the field of quantum information and quantum ( control-)dynamics has recently attracted a lot of attention , namely the _ quantum speed limit _ @xcite .",
    "the quantum speed limit time is the minimal time a quantum system needs to evolve between an initial and a final state , and it can be understood as a generalization of the heisenberg uncertainty relation for time and energy .",
    "a particularly useful set of mathematical tools for approaching this kind of problems is summarized under the headline _ optimal control theory_. however , depending on how these tools are used different `` optimal '' results are concluded , which was recently discussed carefully for qubits evolving under unitary dynamics in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for instance , caneva _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the krotov algorithm @xcite fails to converge if one tries to drive a qubit faster than an independently determined quantum speed limit , while hegerfeldt used optimal control theory to compute a quantum speed limit that allows even faster evolution @xcite .",
    "however , quantum optimal control theory is not restricted to determining the maximal speed , and has , e.g. , been successfully applied to finding driving protocols that maximize squeezing @xcite and entanglement @xcite in harmonic oscillators , or efficiently cool molecular vibrations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , optimal control theory has remained a mathematical tool box , which is mostly applied in various fields of engineering and applied mathematics , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite , while it is still rather scarcely discussed in the physics literature and textbooks .",
    "however , finding `` optimal '' processes has been an important topic of constant interest in virtually all fields of physics . only recently , optimal processes in thermodynamic applications have attracted renewed interest @xcite .",
    "moreover , in quantum computing so called _ shortcuts to adiabaticity _ have been in the focus of intense research efforts .",
    "these shortcuts are optimal driving protocols that reproduce in a finite time the same outcomes as resulting from an infinitely slow process , see for instance ref .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", we will be interested in solving an interesting and important problem , namely how to `` optimally '' control a simple quantum information device .",
    "to this end , we will analyze the damped jaynes - cummings model by means of optimal control theory , and discuss the optimal finite - time processing of one qubit of information .",
    "a similar classical problem was recently analyzed in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , this paper is also of pedagogical value .",
    "we will use the fully analytically solvable example in order to illustrate concepts of optimal control theory , and to `` translate '' between the language typically used in engineering textbooks and vocabulary that is more familiar in quantum thermodynamics .",
    "we will illustrate that the formulation of the problem is crucial , as the resulting optimal protocol intimately depends on the question asked .",

    "generally , accessibility refers to controls that are able to drive the state , @xmath4 , to an open set in state space @xcite . for the sake of simplicity we focus here on the simpler question , namely : given a state equation with initial value @xmath5 , which control protocols @xmath3 drive the system to a _",

    "however , in classical mechanics the action is typically a functional of the state variable only , @xmath12\\equiv{\\mathcal{j}}\\left[{\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$}}_t\\right]$ ] , and @xmath15 is a parameter , whereas in the present context we are explicitly asking for an _ optimal protocol _ @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the definition of @xmath16 $ ] is particular to the problem , and depends on the specific situation .",
    "we will illustrate this point shortly for a concrete example",
    ". however , already here it should be clear that the formulation of the problem anticipates what will be considered optimal .",
    "generally , defining the cost functional is a non - trivial task , and we are considering here only the simplest formulation @xcite .",
    "before we move on to a specific system let us briefly outline how to generally solve the problem . in complete analogy to classical mechanics",
    "it is typically more practical to use a `` hamiltonian '' approach .",
    "the control hamiltonian , @xmath17 , is obtained by a legendre transform of the control lagrangian , @xmath18 , and reads , @xmath19 where we introduced the canonical momentum @xmath20 , which is also called the _",
    "costate_. accordingly , the _ costate equation _ is given by @xmath21 it is worth emphasizing again that we are here concentrating on the simplest possible case .",
    "generally the final value of the costate @xmath22 depends on the problem under study . if , for example , one introduces a terminal cost , i.e. , a term in eq .   that penalizes controls that drive the state @xmath0 `` only close '' to a specific target state , then @xmath23 can be written as a gradient of this terminal cost @xcite .",
    "notice that the boundary condition determines the _ final _ value of @xmath24 at @xmath8 , whereas the state equations is an _ initial _ value problem .",
    "this splitting of boundary conditions is a consequence of @xmath25 and thus @xmath17 depending on a _ time - dependent _ control @xmath26 @xcite , in contrast to problems in classical mechanics , where @xmath27 is only a parameter .",
    "pontryagin s principle then states @xcite that : given @xmath28 is the optimum of all admissible protocol then @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the supremum , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are solutions of hamilton s equation of motion for the optimal control @xmath11 ,    @xmath33    if @xmath34 is the global maximum for all controls @xmath26 then @xmath35 , for all times @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "generally , however , the global maximum will be attained for a control @xmath38 that is not admissible , i.e. , @xmath39 , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : admissible ] for an illustration",
    ". therefore , we will call the control , @xmath40 , optimal for which @xmath41 takes a local supremum .",
    "note , for instance , that the supremum could lie on the boundary , @xmath42 , of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the control hamiltonian takes a local _ maximum _ if and only if @xmath43 is closed , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "we tacitly assumed that the set of admissible controls is not empty , that means that there is at least one admissible control , and therefore a solution exists .",
    "in most situations it is hardly feasible to find analytical expressions for the optimal control @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , the problem can usually be solved iteratively .",
    "this means one can find a sequence @xmath45 with @xmath46 which converges towards @xmath47 , that is @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "to this end , various iterative methods have been developed in numerical approaches , which typically work for specific sets of problems @xcite .",
    "one of the conceptually simplest and earliest approaches is the _ method of steepest descent _ @xcite .",
    "this method is used in virtually all areas of physics , and its convergence properties are well - studied @xcite . in this",
    "approach elements of the sequence , @xmath45 , are constructed `` following '' a gradient on a landscape , here along the gradient of the control hamiltonian with respect to the control .",
    "however , for our present purposes we will have to modify the usual algorithm to ensure that all elements of the sequence @xmath45 are actually admissible .",
    "the _ modified steepest descent algorithm _ consists of four steps :    [ [ step-1 ] ] step 1 : +",

    "generically , there is no guarantee that the such determined control @xmath57 is admissible .",
    "therefore , we have to modify the conventional algorithm at this point . as hinted earlier , the modification of the algorithm and hence the optimal control crucially depends on the formulation of the problem .",
    "the simplest strategy is to check whether @xmath58 : if the answer is yes then return to _ step 2 _ , where @xmath59 is replaced by @xmath57 ; if the answer is no , return to _ step 2 _ , where you keep @xmath59 and choose a new @xmath60 to compute a new @xmath61 .",
    "however , this modification is not very systematic and the sequence might easily get `` trapped '' , i.e. , the algorithm fails to converge .",
    "it has been noted that all iterative methods in optimal control theory show this issue of `` getting locally trapped '' .",
    "one usually has to run the algorithm several times for various combinations of @xmath62 and @xmath56 to ensure that the numerical outcome is reliable @xcite , i.e. , the resulting @xmath47 corresponds to the `` smallest '' local minimum in @xmath63 .",
    "another strategy is to modify the algorithm in a way such that we only have pointwise , but no longer uniform convergence .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a time - dependent stepsize @xmath64 . in simple words",
    "this means , that the control sequence @xmath59 converges towards the optimal control , @xmath11 , with different speeds for different `` points '' @xmath36 along the protocol .",

    "[ [ importance - of - the - formulation ] ] importance of the formulation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we have already seen earlier that the formulation of the problem anticipates what will be considered optimal . in particular , the choice of admissible controls is crucial , and a more careful analysis of the formulation and set - up to derive quantum speed limits is in order .",
    "therefore , we continue our analysis by deriving the optimal controls resulting from the minimal time approach and from the geometric approach for our model system introduced above",
    ". it will turn out , that by carefully formulating the problem , both approaches , minimal time and geometric , can be reconciled .      in the minimal time",
    "approach one is interested in minimizing the process time @xmath7 , during which the qubit evolves .",
    "therefore , the performance measure is simply given by @xmath164=\\tau\\,.\\ ] ] in this case @xmath165 $ ] is no longer a functional of the control @xmath88 and the state @xmath102 , but reduces to a parameter .",
    "accordingly , the control hamiltonian reads @xmath166 and , hence , we obtain for the costate equation @xmath167 the latter differential equation can be readily solved analytically and the solution is written as @xmath168 it is easy to see that for all real @xmath88 the boundary condition can only be fulfilled for @xmath169 , and therefore we have @xmath170 .",
    "thus , the control hamiltonian for this problem greatly simplifies .",
    "since @xmath171 and @xmath172 is maximal for the optimal control , we conclude @xmath173 one easily convinces oneself that the optimal admissible control then has to read @xmath174 from these results one is tempted to conclude that a qubit coupled to a leaky cavity can evolve arbitrarily fast , and there is no fundamental bound on the minimal evolution time .",
    "however , it is not immediately clear if this result is only of mathematical nature , or if it is also physically relevant , see also the discussion in @xcite .    in a previous section we considered the heating rate , which quantifies the power input into the qubit . for the latter optimal control the state trajectory is described by @xmath175 , and hence we obtain @xmath176 one easily convinces oneself , that the latter expression is the _ maximal _ heating rate , i.e. , the maximal power input possible .",
    "equation   clearly shows , that for our system infinitely fast evolution is possible if at the same time infinitely much power is pumped into the qubit .",
    "however , this process will generally not be relevant for any experimental situation , as an infinite power impulse very likely will `` kick '' the atom out of the optical cavity .",
    "now let us turn to the geometric approach . to this end",
    ", we evaluate the bures angle , which simply reads @xmath177 first , we have to ensure that the inequality in eq .",
    "is a tight bound .",
    "the left side of inequality becomes @xmath178 and we have for the right side @xmath179 $ ] we will , therefore , need a term @xmath180 , that minimizes the difference between left and right side and `` makes '' the inequality as close as possible to an equality .",
    "second , we are interested in such processes , whose evolution speed is maximal , i.e. , @xmath181 is maximal . therefore , a performance measure @xmath182 $ ] can be defined to read @xmath183&=\\int_0^\\tau{\\mathrm{d}}t\\,\\left[\\left(|\\dot{z}_t|+\\dot{z}_t\\right)^2-|\\dot{z}|^2\\right]\\nonumber \\\\ & = -\\int_0^\\tau{\\mathrm{d}}\\,\\gamma_t^2\\left(z_t+1\\right)^2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we immediately recognize as minus the performance measure that minimizes the heating rate , @xmath182=-{\\mathcal{j}}_q[z_t,\\,\\gamma_t ] $ ] . the optimal admissible protocol that maximizes the quantum evolution speed is identical to the control that maximizes the heating rate .",
    "such an optimal control , however , is just the optimal protocol that we derived within the minimal time approach , namely the delta - peak control .    in conclusion",
    ", we explained that the minimal time approach and geometric approach ask fundamentally different questions .",
    "however , we also showed that if the problem is formulated carefully by means of optimal control theory , the same results for the quantum speed limit time can be obtained .",
    "we found that there is no fundamental bound on the speed with which one qubit of information can be written by a leaky , optical cavity , if we allow for an infinite power input into the system .",
    "practically , however , one is rather interested in `` optimal '' controls , that are more experimentally relevant , as for instance , the fastest evolution under a bounded heating rate . to solve these problems one first has to carefully define the admissible controls , and find a cost functional",
    "the reflects the full physical situation .",
    "we expect that the actual quantum speed limit is then governed by , for instance , the maximal control power .",
    "naively computing quantum speed limits by means of optimal control theory can yield unphysical results .",
    "therefore , special attention has to be paid to a careful definition of the set of admissible controls and the performance measure .",
    "the outcome of optimal control theory is only as good , i.e. , physical as the formulation of the problem .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to find control protocol that optimally process one qubit of information . to this end",
    ", we have presented some elements of optimal control theory . for a specific system , namely the damped jaynes - cummings model ,",
    "we then have developed a modified method of steepest descent , which ensures that all elements of a control sequence are actually admissible controls . with this novel algorithm",
    "we have numerically determined the optimal controls that minimize the power input and the dispersion rates .",
    "special emphasis has been put on illustrating that the outcome of an analysis by means of optimal control theory crucially depends on the formulation of the problem . in doing so ,",
    "we have been able to reconcile two fundamentally different approaches to the quantum speed limit , which yield the same result if the problem is formulated carefully .",
    "last but not least this paper is of pedagogical value .",
    "the presentation of the analysis is mostly self - contained and we hope that our results will spur interactions between different fields . in particular , we believe that this paper could make optimal control theory more accessible and known among physicists , and introduce engineers and applied mathematicians to problems and questions in quantum thermodynamics .",
