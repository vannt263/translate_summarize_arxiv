    "starting from 1992 kurucz published new extended grids of model atmospheres for several metallicities [ m / h ] and several microturbulent velocities @xmath6 . in each grid , the models cover a range in t@xmath2 and @xmath3 g from 3500  k to 50000  k and from 0.0  dex to 5.0  dex , respectively .",
    "all the models were computed with the atlas9 code , which handles line opacity with the opacity distribution function method ( odfs ) .    later on , castelli extended kurucz s models by computing some more grids for metallicities with enhanced @xmath7  elements abundances ( @xmath80.4  dex ) and for @xmath6 values different from those adopted by kurucz .",
    "furthermore , she recomputed the cool models in a few kurucz grids by assuming the overshooting option for the convection switched off ( castelli , gratton & kurucz , 1997 ) .",
    "both kurucz and castelli models were computed by using kurucz s ( 1990 ) odfs .",
    "they are all based on the solar abundances from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , except for iron which is not the same in all the odfs .",
    "in fact , the iron abundance @xmath3(n@xmath9/n@xmath10 ) is @xmath44.53  dex from holweger et al .",
    "( 1995 ) when odfs for enhanced @xmath7 elements abundances were computed and it is @xmath44.37  dex from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) when odfs for no enhanced @xmath7 elements were generated .",
    "therefore , it is not straightforward to state the net effect of the @xmath7 elements abundances on the model structure .    finally , the number of models is different in the various grids and also in some grids some models have 72 and some others have 64 plane parallel layers",
    ". these differences may give problems when interpolations in the models and in the grids are performed .",
    "the aim of this work is the computation of grids of homogenous atlas9 models , where  homogenous \" means that :    ( 1 ) : :    the number of models is 476 in all the grids .",
    "table  1 shows which are    the models .",
    "( 2 ) : :    all the models have the same number of 72 plane parallel layers from    @xmath3@xmath11=@xmath46.875 to    @xmath82.00 at steps of    @xmath12@xmath3@xmath11=0.125 . ( 3 ) : :    all the models are computed with the updated solar abundances from    grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) and therefore with updated odfs , which now    also include h@xmath0o lines . ( 4 ) : :    all the models are computed with the convection option switched on and    with the overshooting option switched off . mixing - length convection    with l / h@xmath13=1.25 is assumed for all the models . the    convective flux decreases with increasing t@xmath2    and it naturally disappears for t@xmath2 of the order    of 9000  k.",
    "the line opacity is included in the new atlas9 models through new - odfs based on the grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) ( gs98 ) solar abundances .",
    "table  2 lists the differences between gs98 abundances and those from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) which were used in the kurucz ( 1990 ) odfs .",
    "new - odfs are computed for 57 values of temperature t ( from 1995  k to 199526  k , i.e. for @xmath3 t ranging from 3.30 to 5.30 at steps of 0.02  dex ) and 25 values of gas pressure @xmath3p@xmath14 ( from @xmath44.0 to + 8.0 at steps of 0.5  dex ) , while kurucz ( 1990 ) odfs were computed for 56 values of t ( from 2089  k to 199526  k , i.e. for @xmath3 t ranging from 3.32 to 5.30 at steps of 0.02  dex ) and 21 values of @xmath3p@xmath14 ( from @xmath42.0 to + 8.0 at steps of 0.5  dex ) .",
    "the larger odf table should allow better modelling the upper layers of cool stars and of giant stars .",
