    "recent interest in strongly correlated systems in non - square lattices , such as the triangular , honeycomb and kagom lattices , is justified by the possible realization of exotic metallic @xcite , magnetic @xcite and superconducting states @xcite both in inorganic and organic materials . from the organic side ,",
    "graphite and related carbon allotropes are physical systems where growing evidence for exotic types of ground states is being accumulated during the last few years . in graphite , for example , experimental research put forward evidence for unusual metallic and magnetic properties @xcite . in particular , ferromagnetism has been observed at high temperature in graphite @xcite which may not be due to magnetic impurities . also , the observation @xcite of magnetic order induced by proton irradiation challenges the theoretical description .",
    "graphite is not alone on the ferromagnetic - order - by - disorder scenario , with the inorganic caruo@xmath4 material also exhibiting disorder - induced ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "recent experimental work @xcite has produced atomic thin graphite planes where the exciting physics of 2d dirac fermions may be directly observable . motivated by these experimental studies and because the microscopic origin of ferromagnetism in these compounds is far from being understood , we decided to study the magnetic properties of a doped hubbard model on an honeycomb lattice  a single graphite plane . to the best of our knowledge , ferromagnetic spin waves in the honeycomb lattice ( as an itinerant electron system ) have not been studied in the past .",
    "the fact that the honeycomb lattice is a bravais lattice with a basis immediately presents us the possibility of observing both polar and acoustic spin waves @xcite .",
    "we focus our research on the stability of the weak homogeneous ferromagnetic phase found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model is introduced in section [ modelsec ] and the energy spectrum for the weak homogeneous ferromagnetic system is derived ; section [ spinwvsec ] is devoted to the description of spin waves in the weak homogeneous ferromagnetic phase ; the possibility of spiral spin states is investigated in section [ sprls ] , where a spiral arrangement is found with lower energy than that of a uniform magnetization ; section [ disorder ] gives a discussion on the possibility of formation of electronic bound states , due to impurities , and of the possible relevance of disorder to experiments on proton irradiated graphite .",
    "the hubbard model is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 represents a creation ( destruction ) electron operator with spin @xmath8 at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the hopping integral between two sites @xmath9 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the on - site coulomb repulsion , and @xmath13 is the chemical potential . in the honeycomb lattice",
    "we identify two sub - lattices , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see figure [ honey ] ) , where the primitive vectors of the underlying triangular lattice are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for later use",
    "we also define the vector @xmath18 .",
    "the reciprocal lattice vectors are @xmath19 and @xmath20 and define a hexagonal shaped first brillouin zone . also shown in figure [ honey ] are the vectors connecting any @xmath14 atom to its nearest neighbours , denoted as @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the electrons leaving on each sub - lattice will be denoted by field operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the fourier transformation between real and momentum spaces is given by : @xmath26 and we take @xmath27 as the number of unit cells . in the calculations below , we shall consider first and second neighbour hopping integrals , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the hubbard model then takes the form : @xmath30 + h_u\\ , , \\label{hamilt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 in the ferromagnetic ground state , the average occupancy of lattices sites is given by @xmath32 with the spin index @xmath33 .",
    "this may also be generalized to describe antiferromagnetic ordering if we replace @xmath34 with @xmath35 in one of the equations ( [ broke ] ) @xcite .",
    "an hartree - fock treatment of the hubbard term , @xmath36 , taking into account equation ( [ broke ] ) , yields a set of quasi - particle bands given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a band index . in the ferromagnetic phase",
    "the single particle green s functions can be written , in momentum space , as : @xmath39 where we have defined @xmath40 .",
    "the hartree - fock magnetization is given by @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "since we are mainly concerned with the ferromagnetic phase , the calculations in sections [ spinwvsec ] and [ sprls ] are performed for an electronic density smaller than half filling .",
    "therefore , electrons at the fermi level will not be treated as massless dirac fermions .",
    "such treatment is usually appropriate for electrons in graphite planes at half filling ( or close to half filling ) @xcite .",
    "we obtain the magnetic collective excitations from the poles of the transverse spin susceptibility calculated in the rpa approximation . because there are two sub - lattices",
    ", the susceptibility is actually a second order tensor given by the expression @xmath42 where @xmath43 are sub - lattice labels and @xmath44 are the spin - raising and lowering operators for each sub - lattice .",
    "the rpa expansion gives a dyson equation for the transverse spin susceptibility , which can by written , in matrix form , as @xmath45^{-1 }   \\bm\\chi^0(\\bm q , i\\omega_n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 denotes the @xmath47 identity matrix .",
    "the poles of the susceptibility tensor , corresponding to the magnetic excitations , are then obtained from the condition : @xmath48 = 0 . \\label{det}\\ ] ] below the particle - hole continuum of excitations , the spectral ( delta - function contributions ) part in @xmath49 vanish and there is the additional relation @xmath50 .",
    "the zero order susceptibility tensor , @xmath51 , can be written as @xmath52 where the matrix @xmath53 contains the coherence factors : @xmath54 @xmath55 $ ] , with @xmath56 representing the fermi function with argument @xmath57 , and equivalent representations hold for the other cases .",
    "in addition to the collective ferromagnetic spin waves there are also single particle flip - spin excitations which define the so called stoner continuum . in our case we may have up to four regions in the energy - momentum plane associated with the latter type of excitations .",
    "their spectra are given by @xmath58 depending on the position of the fermi level , one or two of the regions defined by equation ( [ stoner ] ) may not occur because the bands may be empty .",
    "because we have the lower ( @xmath59 ) bands partially filled , there always are two stoner regions given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we consider only this case below ( for the other cases the results are qualitatively the same ) . in figures",
    "[ sw1 ] and [ sw2 ] the left panel shows the the stoner continuum defined by @xmath60 as the area enclosed by the dashed - dotted line starting at @xmath62 .",
    "the model parameters have been chosen so that the system is definitely not antiferromagnetic . in figures [ sw1 ] and [ sw2 ]",
    "we plot the solutions to equation ( [ det ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the system has two different types of collective magnetic excitations , namely the usual acoustic mode @xmath63 and the polar or optical mode @xmath64 , associated with the existence of two atoms per unit cell @xcite .",
    "it is quite interesting that the behaviour of both branches of excitations does not follow the same trend along different directions of the brillouin zone : along the @xmath65 direction ( see figure [ sw1 ] ) , for example , and for @xmath66 only the optical branch remains . on the other hand , in the @xmath2 direction ( see figure [ sw2 ] ) it is the optical branch that vanishes at @xmath67 while the acoustic mode survives .",
    "the vanishing frequency of the acoustic ( or optical ) modes at finite momentum is associated with an instability of the homogeneous weak ferromagnetic phase toward a state exhibiting possibly weak ferromagnetic order in the @xmath68 direction and spiral order in the @xmath69 plane , which will be analyzed in section [ sprls ] below .",
    "the eigenvector of the matrix @xmath70 , @xmath71 that is associated with the eigenvalue @xmath72 gives the spin wave amplitudes over the @xmath14 and @xmath15 sub - lattices .",
    "we note that equation ( [ det ] ) is equivalent to the eigenproblem @xmath73 = \\frac 1 u \\left[\\begin{array}{c }   { \\langle}s_a^+{\\rangle}\\\\ { \\langle}s_b^+{\\rangle}\\end{array } \\right]\\ , , \\label{spinor}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 denote the spin wave amplitudes over the two sub - lattices @xcite . in our case , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the equations for the eigenvalue @xmath77 and the corresponding eigenvector are : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the relevant eigenvalue , as can be seen from equation ( [ spinor ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ angle ] ) shows that the spin wave amplitudes are related by a phase factor .",
    "therefore , the phase of the complex matrix element @xmath80 determines the angle between the transverse spin components @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the optical mode in the @xmath65 direction ( shown in figure [ sw1 ] ) starts off with @xmath83 for small @xmath0 , as expected of an optical mode , but the angle between @xmath81 and @xmath82 monotonically decreases from @xmath84 , upon increasing wave vector , and equals @xmath85 when @xmath86 attains its minimum . at that point , @xmath87 is pure imaginary .    on the other hand , in the acoustic mode the angle increases from zero to @xmath85 , when @xmath88 is maximum ( the angle between the spins is illustrated in figure [ cones ] ) .",
    "as the wave vector further increases , the acoustic mode frequency rapidly decreases and vanishes at @xmath89 .",
    "considering now the spin waves in the @xmath2 direction , the angle between the precessing spins is always zero or @xmath84 in the acoustic and optical modes , respectively .",
    "the optical mode frequency vanishes shortly after the interception with the acoustic branch and only the latter survives for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the phase difference between spin wave amplitudes just described for the @xmath65 direction is a manifestation of the complex coherence factors appearing in the single particle green functions ( [ gab ] ) and ( [ gba ] ) , resulting from the honeycomb lattice geometry .",
    "the disappearance of the acoustic mode , at wave vector @xmath90 , and of the optical mode , at wave vector @xmath91 , suggests an instability to a spiral spin state @xcite .",
    "in such a state , the spiral spin configuration is characterized by non - zero transverse magnetization at site @xmath11 , @xmath92 , in addition to a uniform alignment in the @xmath68 direction , @xmath93 .",
    "the amplitudes of the spiral , @xmath94 , at sub - lattices @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given by : @xmath95 in general , there will be a nonzero angle @xmath96 between the transverse sub - lattice magnetizations @xmath81 and @xmath82 , so that @xmath97 .",
    "following @xcite , the mean field equations are obtained from the minimization of the ground state energy with respect to the order parameters @xmath94 and @xmath93 .",
    "each bloch @xmath98-state , @xmath99 , representing an elementary excitation , is a linear superposition of the fields @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "conversely , we can rewrite each of the fields as a combination of bloch states , and recast the expectation value of the kinetic term in ( [ hamilt ] ) as well as the order parameters ( [ sab ] ) in terms of @xmath99 operators . using wick s theorem , the expectation value of the hubbard term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] )",
    "can be expressed as : @xmath102 by minimizing @xmath103 , as given in equations ( [ hamilt ] ) and ( [ medu ] ) , we find that the bloch @xmath98-state , @xmath99 , diagonalizes an effective @xmath104 hamiltonian matrix , @xmath105 , which can be expressed in the basis @xmath106 , as @xmath107\\ ] ] where the @xmath47 matrices @xmath108 ( with @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 are given by : @xmath111\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath112.\\ ] ] the mean field equations only determine the phase difference between @xmath81 and @xmath82 , so we choose @xmath81 to be real . at each point in the weak ferromagnetic region of the phase diagram",
    "we have to choose the spiral wave vector @xmath113 that minimizes the ground state energy .",
    "this vector should lie along one of the high symmetry directions in the brillouin zone .",
    "we first look for the most favorable wave vectors lying along the @xmath65 direction . for the same parameters as in figure [ sw1 ]",
    ", we find a spiral state with @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "we note that this spiraling state has a smaller @xmath68-component of the magnetization than that in the uniform phase . the angle between transverse magnetizations @xmath117 .",
    "we find , however , that the energy difference between this spiral state and that with uniform magnetization is indeed very small , not exceeding @xmath118 per lattice site .",
    "this has been checked for several lattice sizes .",
    "we also note that the obtained spin transverse component is not negligible compared to @xmath93 .",
    "the most favorable spiral wave vector depends slightly on interaction and density : at @xmath119 and @xmath120 , for instance , @xmath121 is the most favorable , with @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we now consider states with @xmath125 .",
    "overall , the energies of these spiral states are found to be lower than those of the states with @xmath126 considered above .",
    "for the same parameters as in figure [ sw1 ] , we find the optimum wave vector to be @xmath127 , where @xmath93 vanishes and @xmath128 .",
    "the spin configuration is , therefore , planar and the two sub - lattices have opposite magnetizations .",
    "the energy ( per lattice site ) is @xmath129 lower than that with uniform magnetization .",
    "an approximate representation of this state is shown in figure [ spir ] .",
    "the length of the most energetically favorable @xmath113 depends significantly on @xmath12 and @xmath130 . if , for instance , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , then @xmath131 is the most favorable , with @xmath132 .",
    "the energy per lattice site of this state is @xmath133 lower than that of the uniform state .",
    "in such a planar spin configuration , a small ferromagnetic alignment along @xmath68 could still arise in the presence of a weak anisotropy or external magnetic field .",
    "an anisotropic perturbation producing an easy axis ( or a small magnetic field ) need not exceed an energy of the order @xmath134 per lattice site in order to induce the uniform state , specially at the lower @xmath12 values considered .",
    "it is still possible that the minimum energy spin structure of the system could be a superposition of spirals with different @xmath113 vectors , as has been found for the @xmath135 hubbard triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "the search for such structures , as well as their sensitivity to disorder , is beyond the scope of this work , however .",
    "we also find that the spiral states are absent at smaller densities ( @xmath136 ) . a schematic representations of our findings is shown in figure [ fd ] .",
    "ferromagnetic order induced by disorder in proton irradiated graphite was observed by y. kopelevich _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . the disorder induced by proton irradiation",
    "can be modeled by diagonal disorder , where the local energy of some sites is modified .",
    "the problem of treating disorder and coulomb interaction together is a hard one in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "therefore we start by studying the effect of a finite density of uncorrelated impurities on the electron gas in the honeycomb lattice at half filling , where the low - energy electronic excitations can be described by massless dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "the effect of disorder on the properties of dirac fermions leads to some unexpected results , and was discussed in the context of disordered superconductors by some authors @xcite . in our study , we compute the @xmath137matrix using the massless dirac fermion description .    the matsubara green s functions are determined via the equation - of - motion method . after the usual manipulations @xcite we obtain the @xmath47 green s function matrix as @xmath138 with the matsubara @xmath137matrix given by @xmath139^{-1}\\ , , \\label{1imp}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is the green s function matrix with @xmath141 , and @xmath142 for a small density , @xmath143 , of scatterers ( but finite in the thermodynamic limit ) , and after the position of the scatterers has been averaged over ensemble configurations , the green s function matrix can be written as @xmath144^{-1}-\\bm \\sigma(i\\omega_n)]^{-1}\\ , , \\label{gtm}\\ ] ] where @xcite @xmath145^{-1}\\,.\\ ] ] once the green s function ( [ gtm ] ) is known , one can proceed to include the effect of correlations into the problem .",
    "the electronic bound states are given by the poles of ( [ 1imp ] ) .",
    "there always is a bound state due to the impurity , below the energy band , independently of the value of @xmath146 .",
    "the existence of bound states allows for a possible mechanism to the disorder induced ferromagnetic behaviour in proton irradiated graphite .",
    "graphite is usually modeled as a half - filled honeycomb plane , where electrons near the fermi level have linear dispersion @xcite .",
    "the sample irradiation produces the displacement of the carbon atoms from their original position . in this case , even if hydrogen atoms become bonded to some of the carbons , from the lattice point of view a dilution of lattice points is being induced . in this case",
    ", we should take the limit @xmath147 , even if @xmath143 is small .",
    "this effect leads to drastic change in the density of states @xmath148 , where a strong enhancement of @xmath148 in the vicinity of @xmath149 is obtained .",
    "such an enhancement can be responsible for a large reduction of the critical @xmath12 needed for ferromagnetism , as follows from the stoner criterion .",
    "the effect of disorder on the density of states of dirac fermions is shown in figure [ dosv ] for several values of @xmath143 and @xmath146 . if @xmath146 is negative there",
    "are bound states for the electrons below the bottom of the band .",
    "as @xmath146 increases an enhancement of @xmath148 in the vicinity of @xmath149 starts to develop .     for several impurity densities @xmath143 and @xmath146 values , in a model of dirac fermions .",
    "the left panel show @xmath150 over the bandwidth .",
    "the right panel shows a zoom of the density of states presented in the left panel.,width=302 ]    we have , therefore , two possible routes toward the appearance of magnetic order in graphite , namely bound states and enhancement of the density of states .",
    "this type of enhancement of @xmath148 is characteristic of acoustic excitations , either fermionic ( dirac fermions ) or bosonic ( magnons)@xcite .",
    "this very qualitative view has to be corroborated by more detailed calculations taking into account both disorder and coulomb interaction .",
    "in particular , it is important to compute how the critical lines from the paramagnetic to the magnetic phases change with the amount of disorder .",
    "these issues will be the subject of a future publication .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the spin collective excitations of the homogeneous weak ferromagnetic state in the honeycomb lattice and found an instability to spiral spin structures at electron densities above @xmath151 although our calculation is performed for a system with the same type of atoms it is simple to generalize it for honeycomb lattices with different type of atoms as in bnc hexagonal sheets @xcite",
    ". however , the main differences will be : ( i ) the number of optical and acoustic branches increases ; ( ii ) the different site energies due to different atoms will change the form of the spin wave bands . we have also suggested a possible mechanism for ferromagnetism in irradiated graphite : the appearance of bound states due to disorder and the enhancement of the density of states . if it becomes possible in the future to perform neutron scattering experiments on ferromagnetic graphite allotrope the results we present here may have direct experimental importance .",
