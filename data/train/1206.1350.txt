    "<S> we use the bogoliubov theory of bose - einstein condensation to study the properties of dipolar particles ( atoms or molecules ) confined in a uniform two - dimensional geometry at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we find equilibrium solutions to the dipolar gross - pitaevskii equation and the bogoliubov - de gennes equations . </S>",
    "<S> using these solutions we study the effects of quantum fluctuations in the system , particularly focussing on the instability point , where the roton feature in the excitation spectrum touches zero . specifically , we look at the behaviour of the noncondensate density , the phase fluctuations , and the density fluctuations in the system . near the instability , </S>",
    "<S> the density - density correlation function shows a particularly intriguing oscillatory behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> higher order correlation functions display a distinct hexagonal lattice pattern formation , demonstrating how an observation of broken symmetry can emerge from a translationally symmetric quantum state . </S>"
