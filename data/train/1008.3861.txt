    "the conclusion of the previous paragraph is the expected one .",
    "the dipole form factor is but a rough description of higher - energy data and is unacceptable on grounds of the analyticity requirements stemming from causality and the locality of fundamental interactions .",
    "moreover , any simple one - parameter description of the proton s non - relativistic sacks form factor , @xmath1 in terms of only one mass parameter is inaccurate : the proton is not so simple .",
    "more precisely , the proton s relativistic form factor , @xmath2 , is expected , in the timelike domain @xmath3 , to have a complex structure , with a first cut starting at @xmath4 and a plethora of branch cuts and complex resonant poles thereafter @xcite .",
    "the same is true of the charge distribution , @xmath5 , the fourier transform of @xmath1 .",
    "even most naively , @xmath5 is expected to have a  core \" and a  pion cloud \" @xcite , corresponding to a minimum of two length parameters .",

    "the leading proton - size correction to the energy levels of an @xmath8 atom is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mean square radius of @xmath5 .",
    "the charge distribution is related to the non - relativistic limit of the electric form - factor , @xmath11 , by the fourier transformation @xmath12    precise measurements of @xmath10 have two origins .",
    "one is mainly based on the theory @xcite and observations @xcite of hydrogen .",
    "the result , compiled in codata @xcite , is @xmath13 the second type of measurement is based on the theory and observations @xcite of very low - energy electron - proton scattering .",

    "even if we took the sixth root of this number to bring it closer to unity as experimentalists do with @xmath34 to halve the relative error the result would , at the required great precision , still epitomize the model - dependence of the results .",
    "the photon propagator in the time - like domain ( @xmath35 ) has led to considerable revolutions ( e.g.  the discovery and interpretation of the @xmath36 ) , as well as interesting challenges , in particular close to its cut at @xmath37 .",
    "the modeling of the electric and magnetic form factors @xmath11 and @xmath38 of protons and neutrons in terms of dispersion relations for the photon propagator involves , literally , dozens of parameters @xcite .",
