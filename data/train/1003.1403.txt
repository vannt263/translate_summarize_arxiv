    "<S> the structures of the eigenstates are intimately connected to the thermalization process . as stated by the eth </S>",
    "<S> , thermalization is expected to occur when the expectation values of experimental observables ( with respect to eigenstates of the hamiltonian that are close in energy ) are very similar to each other and , hence , are equal to the microcanonical average , that is , thermalization occurs at the level of eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly the case with goes , where the amplitudes @xmath48 for all @xmath41 s are independent random numbers . </S>",
    "<S> goe eigenstates in any basis then lead to @xmath49  @xcite . for our lattices , </S>",
    "<S> ipr@xmath45 and ipr@xmath46 may approach the goe value only in the middle of the spectrum , as expected for systems with finite - range interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> states at the edges , even in the chaotic limit , are more localized . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as shown in the panels of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : chaos](c ) , the values of iprs for eigenstates close in energy fluctuate significantly as one moves away from the chaotic limit , namely , as @xmath50 , where the system becomes localized in the mf basis , and for @xmath51 , where the system becomes localized in the @xmath11 basis . </S>",

    "<S> we may , therefore , anticipate compliance with the eth even after the opening of the gap .    to verify the relation between eth and the chaos measures analyzed previously , we have studied the eevs of one- and two - body observables for different values of @xmath2 as one crosses the superfluid to insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> we have found qualitatively similar results for them , so we only report here on the kinetic energy [ @xmath53 and the momentum distribution function [ @xmath54 . both are one - body observables , although the former one is local , while the latter is not . </S>",

    "<S> there are large fluctuations of the eevs of both observables over the entire spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath2 increases and one departs from integrability , these fluctuations reduce in the center of the spectrum , and eth becomes valid . to increase @xmath2 even further ( beyond the superfluid to insulator transition ) , increases the fluctuations of the eevs once again as the eigenstates begin to localize in @xmath11 space . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in clear agreement with what we expected based on the chaos indicators @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to be more quantitative , we study the average deviation of the eevs with respect to the microcanonical result ( @xmath68 ) . for an observable @xmath69 , we define @xmath70 are the eevs of @xmath71 . the microcanonical expectation values are computed as usual . </S>",

    "<S> we have checked that our results are independent of the exact value of @xmath74 in the neighborhood of @xmath73 . here , we select @xmath75 such that , for different values of @xmath2 , the effective temperature ( @xmath58 ) is the same for all systems sizes @xcite </S>",

    "<S> they show that , in general , as the system size increases : ( i ) the average deviations of both observables decrease , and ( ii ) the upturn that occurs as localization starts to set in @xmath11 space moves toward larger values of @xmath2 . a comparison between the lower and upper panels in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eth ] also shows that where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are minimal , so are the maximal fluctuations of @xmath55 and @xmath57 in the individual eigenstates , and they decrease with increasing systems size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , eth is valid in that regime and we find no evidence of rare states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above results are in agreement with the chaos measure predictions and indicate that , for thermodynamic systems , eth may be valid , away from the edges of the spectrum , even if one is deep into the insulating side of the phase diagram .    equipped with this knowledge , we are now ready to study the dynamics of such systems after a quench . </S>",

    "<S> we define @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in order to verify the universality of our results , for each value of @xmath2 used for the dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , we prepared nine initial states selected from the eigenstates of the hamiltonian with different values of @xmath78 ( excluding @xmath2 ) and studied the dynamics for all of them . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : timeevolution ] , we depict the average over those nine different time evolutions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> once it is known that the relaxation dynamics brings observables to the values predicted by the diagonal ensemble , and that the accuracy of that prediction improves with increasing system size , all we need to do to check whether the system thermalizes or not is to compare the predictions of the diagonal ensemble with the microcanonical ones . for larger systems , one could also compare with the canonical ensemble , but this is not adequate here due to finite - size effects @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> our studies indicate that thermalization does occur in gapped systems . </S>",
    "<S> if integrability is broken , eth was shown to be valid , away from the edges of the spectrum , even if gaps are present in the spectrum and the ground state of the system is an insulator . </S>",

    "<S> our analysis of different lattice sizes showed that : ( i ) the range of parameters over which eth applies increases with increasing system size ; in particular , eth becomes valid deeper into the insulating side of the phase diagram , and ( ii ) away from integrability , the fluctuations of the eigenstate expectation values of few - body observables decrease with increasing systems size . </S>",
