    "the problem of how molecular motors can operate and realize transport in such a crowded environment as cytosol of biological cells @xcite came only recently in the limelight of attention @xcite . indeed",
    ", numerous recent experiments reveal that submicron particles like various endosomes and organelles , mrna molecules , ionic channels and even smaller nanoparticles diffuse passively anomalously slow with mean - square distance growing sublinearly in time rather than simply diffuse ( linear growth ) on the relevant mesoscopic time and spatial scales @xcite .",
    "molecular motors such as various kinesins are thus indispensable for delivering such and similar cargos e.g. along axons of neuronal cells @xcite . in a two - state flashing ratchet model of molecular motors with position - independent switching rates",
    "it has been shown that a power stroke like operation mechanism can perfectly overcome subdiffusion slowness and result into a highly efficient normal transport characterized by mean transport velocity @xcite .",
    "however , the very possibility to realize such a normal active transport of ( passively ) subdiffusing cargos presents a highly nontrivial issue .",
    "it depends on ( i ) the binding strength of motor protein to the microtubule providing a transport highway , ( ii ) cargo size , ( iii ) motor operating frequency , ( iv ) external force directed again the processive motion of the motor @xcite , and ( v ) the strength of the tether or linker connecting the motor and its cargo @xcite .",
    "anomalous active transport can also be typical for living cells @xcite , and indeed an increasing number of experiments reveals its occurrence @xcite . our modeling route is based on non - markovian generalized langevin equation ( gle ) @xcite description of viscoelasticity @xcite and its multi - dimensional markovian embedding @xcite .",
    "the approach is deeply rooted in the main principles and dynamical foundation of statistical mechanics such as dynamical theory of brownian motion and fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , which must hold when the system is at thermal equilibrium .",
    "the approach explains the dynamical origin of both normal and anomalous brownian motion and naturally extends beyond thermal equilibrium , which makes it most suitable to describe physical processes in living cells .",
    "our theory naturally explains , in particular , why the power exponent of anomalous active transport can be larger than one of the passive subdiffusion and why the power exponent of anomalous active brownian motion can be larger than doubled exponent of passive motion @xcite .",
    "such experimental facts can not be consistently explained within the previous approaches @xcite to anomalous transport by molecular motors , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we develop a rather straightforward generalization of the brownian ratchets approach to modeling of molecular motors @xcite , with a well proven utility in the case of molecular motors underlying memoryless markovian dynamics , towards anomalous non - markovian dynamics with long - lasting memory reflecting viscoelastic effects in cytosol .",
    "non - markovian dynamics can nevertheless be considered as low - dimensional projection of a multi - dimensional markovian dynamics  the idea which has a long tradition in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "as it is is well known , microtubule is a periodic electrically polar structure featured by asymmetric periodic distribution of negative and positive charge densities on its surface @xcite .",
    "it has a spatial period @xmath0 nm .",
    "furthermore , the charge state of the motor protein depends on whether it is nucleotide free ( no extra charges are present ) , either atp , or adp and the phosphate group @xmath1 are bound ( three extra negative elementary charges altogether in each case ) , or only adp is bound ( two extra negative elementary charges ) . reflecting the change of charge distribution on the motor protein the motor binding potential in the electrical field of microtubule can also change accordingly @xcite .",
    "being periodic in space it should , however , be spatially asymmetric , and this asymmetry can direct molecular motor in one selected direction ( which can depend on the particular kind of motor ) when the binding potential begins to stochastically fluctuate .",
    "these fluctuations can be caused by changing the overall charge of the motor protein accompanied by its conformational fluctuations due to the reactions of atp binding , hydrolysis and dissociation of the products , repeated cyclically at random time instances . for two - headed kinesin molecules , one of the simplest , minimal model assumptions",
    "is to assume just two realizations @xmath2 of the binding potential @xmath3 depending on the motor state @xmath4 with the additional symmetry @xmath5 ( the heads are assumed to be identical and treated on equal footing ) @xcite .",
    "this ensures that two subsequent half - steps of the equal length @xmath6 makes one total step @xmath7 in the direction defined by the asymmetry of the potential , see in fig .",
    "kinesins consume one atp molecule per one full step .",
    "hence , energy @xmath8 ev is invested into a half - step .",
    "simplest further assumption is to characterize the switching process by one spatially - independent rate @xmath9 , so that the averaged motor turnover frequency is @xmath10 .",
    "a shortcoming of this approach is that it does not specify a mechanism of how the energy of atp hydrolysis is invested into the change of @xmath3 .",
    "neither reflects it the back influence ( i.e. the _ mutual _ coupling ) of the mechanical motion along microtubule on the biochemical turnovers of the motor enzyme .",
    "in particular , it is not consistent with the demand that if to gradually bring the reaction of atp hydrolysis to thermodynamic equilibrium , @xmath11 , the translation motion of molecular motor must also gradually vanish .",
    "nevertheless , this ratchet approach remains immensely popular for markovian dynamics @xcite .",
    "it has been generalized for anomalously operating motors in refs .",
    "@xcite . the role of mechanochemical coupling @xcite is , however , important to address . in the present work",
    ", we consider a simplest popular model of kinesins with spatially- and @xmath12-dependent transition rates @xmath13 reflecting a mechanochemical coupling of the translation motion of motor protein and its conformational cyclic dynamics .",
    "we also consider an anharmonic model for tether connecting the motor and cargo by taking into account its maximally possible extension length , which encompasses the previous harmonic model @xcite as a limiting case used for comparison .",
    "we start from considering subdiffusive overdamped 1d dynamics of cargo with radius @xmath14 and coordinate @xmath15 subjected to both viscous stokes friction with friction coefficient @xmath16 and memory friction with kernel @xmath17 , as well as to unbiased gaussian thermal random forces @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the environment at temperature @xmath20 which are completely characterized by their autocorrelation functions @xmath21 the above relations express the second ( classical ) fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) by kubo @xcite .",
    "it has a very important physical content .",
    "namely , at the thermal equilibrium the energy loss due to friction is completely compensated by the energy gain from thermal stochastic force serving as a `` stochastic lubricant '' . without it",
    "the motion would stop due to frictional losses .",
    "however , beyond thermal equilibrium there emerges an overall heat flux to the environment , even in the absence of a temperature gradient . minimizing this flux one can arrive at the best thermodynamic efficiency of transport .",
    "this is a very important point : there is no need to minimize the friction , contrary to a popular belief , but rather try to stay most closely to the thermal equilibrium , in order to minimize the heat losses .",
    "furthermore , the cargo is coupled to the motor with coordinate @xmath22 by an elastic tether or linker for which we use a finitely extensible non - linear elastic ( fene ) model @xcite with coupling energy @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is elastic coupling constant . for a small extension , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ,",
    "recovering harmonic spring model , and the maximal extention length is @xmath28 .",
    "the motor is also characterized by stokes friction @xmath29 and the corresponding thermal force @xmath30 obeying fdt ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath31 .",
    "it moves in the binding potential @xmath32 which depends on the motor conformation @xmath33 .",
    "altogether , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an external loading force applied directly to the motor ( for harmonic linker , @xmath36 , it is the same as to apply it to the cargo ) .",
    "if the cargo is not coupled to the motor ( @xmath37 ) , the fractional memory friction @xmath38 , @xmath39 , with fractional friction coefficient @xmath40 leads to subdiffusion of cargo , @xmath41 , at the sufficiently large times @xmath42 .",
    "subdiffusion is characterized by the fractional diffusion coefficient @xmath43 .",
    "initially , for @xmath44 diffusion is , however , normal @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "for all times in this model @xcite , @xmath47^{1-\\alpha } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the generalized mittag - leffler function .",
    "for the coupled motor and cargo , in the limit of infinitely rigid harmonic linker @xmath49 , @xmath36 one can exclude explicitely ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the cargo dynamics and consider anomalous dynamics of the motor alone , characterized by the stokes friction @xmath50 , and the same memory friction .",
    "this would provide a generalization of the model studied in ref .",
    "we consider here but a more general model .    for the binding potential",
    ", we consider the same model of piecewise linear asymmetric potential with amplitude @xmath51 , spatial period @xmath7 , and the maximum dividing the spatial period in the ratio @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , see in fig .",
    "similar models are well - known and widely used @xcite .",
    "important distinction between different further models possible occurs on the level of intrinsic enzyme dynamics @xmath33 .",
    "the chemical coordinate @xmath33 must be cyclic , with the cycle driven preferably in one direction ( rotation of `` catalytic wheel '' @xcite ) by the free energy @xmath12 released from the reaction of atp hydrolysis @xmath54 kept out of the thermodynamical equilibrium ( shifted to the right ) by maintaining out - of - equilibrium concentrations of reactants .",
    "one of simplest related cycles involves four discrete states ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , left ) @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the product of the ( pseudo - first order ) rates ( atp , adp , and @xmath1 molecules are abundant with concentrations kept constant ) of the counter - clockwise transitions to the product of rates in the clockwise transitions must be equal @xmath55 @xcite . in the case of two - headed kinesins , it should be applied to each head , with the rates which are position - dependent ( mechano - chemical coupling ) which would make already a rather complicate model . the simplest possible drastical reduction accounting for the mechano - chemical coupling in the case of head - over - head motion of kinesins , a so - called two - state cycle @xcite ,",
    "is shown in the right part of fig .",
    "one considers only two states and two realizations of @xmath56 obeying additional symmetry @xmath57 , with each transition accounting for a half - step ( one head moves , another remains bound ) .",
    "the corresponding rates must be not only periodic in space , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , but also share additional symmetries , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for a two - cycle it also must be : @xmath62 for any @xmath22 , which can be satisfied , e.g. , by choosing @xmath63 , \\nonumber",

    "it is obviously satisfied for @xmath11 , where both the flux in the transport direction and the flux within the chemical coordinate space vanish together .",
    "notice that if to choose @xmath66 , the latter condition is not possible to satisfy .",
    "we still have some freedom in choosing various models for @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "the rate @xmath67 corresponds to the reactions of atp binding and hydrolysis considered as one lump reaction .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this rate is constant , @xmath69 within some @xmath70 neighborhood of the minimum of potential @xmath71 and is zero otherwise .",
    "correspondingly , the rate @xmath72 within @xmath70 neighborhood of the minimum of potential @xmath73 . given these assumptions we have : @xmath74 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "this is a reasonable assumption from the biophysical point of view , which lends a further support for our model choice .",
    "it is easy to grasp that this model can give very similar results to the ratchet model with spatially independent rates @xmath76 @xcite for sufficiently large @xmath12 and potential amplitude @xmath51 having similar values .",
    "then , @xmath77 is approximately the motor turnover frequency which is nearly independent of @xmath22 .",

    "the mechanical work done by the motor against the external load @xmath35 is @xmath89 .",
    "the energy balance is @xmath90 , if to neglect the back coupling of the potential fluctuations to the biochemical cycle of the motor , i.e. the energy transferred back to the motor and the atp energy source , which drives the whole machinery .",
    "hence , thermodynamic efficiency within such a treatment is @xmath91 it becomes constant for a sufficiently large @xmath92 , in the case of normal transport , where both @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , but algebraically decays to zero , @xmath95 , in the case of anomalous transport , @xmath96 , in the cases of a periodic potential modulation @xcite , or constant potential - independent flashing rates @xcite . in the absence of external load , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , i.e. all the input energy",
    "is eventually dissipated as heat .",
    "however , something useful is yet done .",
    "namely , the cargo is transferred on some distance @xmath99 .",
    "different stokes efficiencies have been defined to characterize energetic performance of motors in such a situation for memoryless friction @xcite .",
    "however , the notion of stokes efficiency becomes even more ambiguous for viscoelastic environment @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a delivery efficiency has been introduced in ref .",
    "it is the ratio of the mean velocity @xmath100 of the cargo delivery to the mean number @xmath101 of motor enzyme turnovers made , @xmath102    the definition ( [ eff1 ] ) is the only possibility to define thermodynamic efficiency in the case of ratchet models which do not specify the mechanism of mechanochemical coupling . within these models , @xmath33 is considered as a driver which provides input energy _",

    "i.e. without feeling any feedback @xcite . however , within the considered model with a _ mutual _ coupling of the conformational cycling of the motor enzyme and its translational motion the interaction energy @xmath103 provides a bidirectional coupling .",
    "the energy can flow in both directions .",
    "the energy supply is provided by a pool of atp molecules which is characterized by out - of - equilibrium chemical potential difference of the reaction of atp hydrolysis , which we denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to define the input energy as @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "then , the thermodynamic efficiency is @xmath105 the idea is clear : each turnover of the catalytic wheel requires energy of the hydrolysis of one atp molecule , in accordance with the main principles of the non - equilibrium thermodynamics applied to the biochemical cycle kinetics @xcite .",
    "one expects that @xmath106 .",
    "this is because a part of the energy @xmath107 can be given back to the motor , its intrinsic degree of freedom , and e.g. recuperated in the backward synthesis , @xmath108 .",
    "this feature is beyond simple ratchet models with spatially independent rates which do not take properly into account such a mechano - chemical coupling .",
    "however , this definition is also not quite precise . as a matter of fact",
    ", one atp molecule is only consumed if a cycle is accomplished in the counter - clockwise direction in the left diagram of fig .",
    "moreover , it is recuperated if the cycle is completed in the clockwise direction . therefore , for the two - state cycle depicted in the right diagram of fig .",

    "obviously , since @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "however , in a regime , where the catalytic wheel rotates overwhelmingly in one direction ( like in michaelis - menthen treatment of enzymatic reactions , where the backward rotation is entirely neglected ) , the distinction between @xmath116 and @xmath119 becomes negligible . by the same token",
    ", one can modify the definition of the delivery efficiency in eq .",
    "( [ delivery_eff ] ) by replacing @xmath120 with the averaged number of atp molecules hydrolyzed .",

    "@xcite , based on the same requirement , by matching @xmath180 with the doubled enzyme turnover rate in @xcite , using other parameters the same and for @xmath282 @xmath199 .",

    "this model choice allowed a direct comparison with the purely elastic linker model in @xcite for the motor - cargo distances less than about one fifth ( with 4% accuracy ) of the maximal extension length .",
    "as a major result of this study , we confirmed within the present more realistic setting , for realistic model parameters , that all the major effects revealed in refs .",
    "@xcite not only survives , but also quantitatively are very similar to the results in @xcite .",
    "this allows to explain how the same motors operating in the same cells can realize both normal and anomalous transport of various cargos depending on the cargo size , strength of the motor ( maximal or stall loading force which depends on the amplitude of binding potential ) , motor operating frequency ( which depends on the atp binding and hydrolysis rate ) , and the loading force opposing the motion .",
    "however , an important discrepancy between two discussed models emerges on the level of thermodynamic efficiency . within the present model ,",
    "the input energy fueling the motor operation is calculated as the energy required to accomplish biochemical cycles of the motor in the working direction by hydrolysing atp molecules @xcite , in accordance with the main principles of the free - energy transduction in isothermal engines @xcite , rather than energy invested into the potential flashes unidirectionally @xcite .",

    "this makes thermodynamic efficiency of molecular motor essentially larger than one obtains in simple ratchet models with unidirectional coupling and constant flashing rates .",
    "we showed that our model can consistently explain near to normal transport with thermodynamic efficiency of 50% in viscoelastic environment of biological cells , for realistic parameters .",
    "as a major surprise , we showed that a strongly anomalous subdiffusive transport is also possible with thermodynamic efficiencies as high as 70% .",
    "here we revealed a very important new feature .",
    "namely , the biochemical enzyme turnovers can become anomalously slow , @xmath283 , @xmath255 , due to mechanical coupling , not being characterized by a turnover rate anymore . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "provide a real challenge for experimental biophysicists .",
    "it is important to mention that the difference in thermodynamic efficiencies does not affect the major results in refs .",
    "@xcite because normally such motors as kinesins are operating at zero thermodynamic efficiency just relocating cargos from one place in the cell to another one , not increasing their potential energy .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the linker anharmonicity practically does not introduce any significant difference in the case of strong linkers with elastic constant typically used in biophysical literature @xcite .",
    "however , a recent experiment @xcite suggested that the elastic constant can be an order of magnitude lower in viscoelastic environment of living cells as compare with one in water . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed within the model of harmonic linker that the transport of large cargos is hardy possible on such a weak linker when the motor operates at a high turnover frequency of about 100 hz .",
    "the linker should then become broken .",
    "however , in the present work we demonstrate that a weak linker can yet sustain such a transport due to strong anharmonic effects .",
    "moreover , we reaffirmed the emergence of a paradoxical regime of cargo s supertransport with @xmath220 on a weak linker for the motor stepping normally with @xmath284 at its small operating frequencies .    to conclude , we hope that the further confirmation of the major results of @xcite in a more realistic setup of this work , as well as new results of this work , will inspire the followup experimental work , which will provide a further feedback to theoretical description of both anomalous and normal transport processes in the viscoelastic crowded environment provided by the cytosol of living cells .",
