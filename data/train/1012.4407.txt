    "the study of plasma under extreme conditions , such as ultrahigh pressure or temperature is growing rapidly and becoming one of the intense fields of plasma research .",
    "there are already numerous laboratory applications for plasmas under high pressure such as that found in semiconductors and nanomaterials @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "plasmas under high temperature are the main ingredients of inertial confinement fusion and tokamaks @xcite .",
    "it is known that many astrophysical places are under such extreme conditions @xcite .",
    "the study of ultradense plasmas , however , requires the relativistic and quantum mechanical considerations .",
    "for instance , the quantum effects become more important when the pauli exclusion principal acts effectively on fermions and the interparticle distances get much lower than the characteristic de broglie thermal wavelength , @xmath0 @xcite which leads to the degeneracy condition . under a very high external pressure ,",
    "for instance , the degenerated electrons in matter become relativistic and obey the more general fermi - dirac statistics @xcite .",
    "it has shown by s. chandrasekhar @xcite that in a white dwarfs the relativistic pressure , under the influence of gravity , may eventually lead to the collapse of star , due to softening of degeneracy pressure . using the fermi - dirac statistics for electrons ,",
    "a rigorous mathematical criteria has been developed @xcite under which a white dwarf can be considered as completely degenerate and has been shown that a typical white dwarf can be examined successfully under the ideal zero - temperature fermi - gas model such as that observed in ordinary metals .",
    "new study based on semiclassical thomas - fermi model reveals that the nonlinear ion - acoustic wave dynamics such a their propagations and collisions in superdense magnetized plasmas are much different when the electrons are ultra - relativistically degenerate from those with non - relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to explore the effects of relativistic degeneracy degree ( relativistic degeneracy parameter ) on nonlinear wave dynamics in a white dwarf under high gravitational pressure",
    ".    there has been already many investigations on the properties of nonlinear propagations in a degenerate plasma which examine either non - relativistic @xcite or ultra - relativistic @xcite degeneracy conditions . however , the later studies in ultra - relativistic degeneracy cases are based on a much simplified model of thomas - fermi approximation which has its known limitations . in current work , using the quantum hydrodynamics formulation @xcite and assuming a more appropriate fermi - dirac model of degeneracy pressure which accounts for the relativistic effects of electrons , we examine the general case which covers the whole range of the relativistic degeneracy , special limits of which should produce the previous results . the presentation of the article is as follows .",
    "the basic normalized plasma equations are introduced in section [ equations ] .",
    "nonlinear arbitrary - amplitude solutions are derived in section [ sagdeev ] . numerical analysis and discussions",
    "is given in section [ discussion ] and final remarks are presented in section [ conclusion ]",
    "in order to evaluate the nonlinear dynamics of ion waves we use the complete set of quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) equations . here , we consider a dense plasma consisting of relativistically degenerate cold electrons , dynamic ultra - cold ions and neutralizing static background dust ingredients .",
    "it is assumed that such a plasma is collision - less due to pauli - blocking .",
    "it is further required that the electrons obey the zero - temperature fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "therefore , the closed set of qhd equation @xcite , in dimensional form , is written as following @xmath1 where , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the @xmath6-th species number - density , mass , atomic - number and velocities with @xmath7 for electron , ion , dust , respectively .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath8 stands for the relativistic electron speed and @xmath9 denotes the ion equilibrium density .",
    "also @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , present the adiabatic constant , ion - temperature and the scaled plank - constant . furthermore , the following scalings can be used in order to obtain the normalized set of equations @xmath13 where , the bar symbols denote the dimensionless quantities which are omitted in forthcoming algebra for simplicity .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are characteristic plasma frequency and sound - speed , respectively , and @xmath16 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "also , @xmath17 denotes the normalizing number - density , @xmath18 a value in white dwarf electron number - density range .",
    "the electron relativistic degeneracy pressure in zero - temperature configuration , which governs most dense astrophysical objects such as white dwarfs , can be expressed in the following general form @xcite @xmath19 } \\right\\},\\ ] ] in which @xmath20 ( @xmath18 ) is the relativistic degeneracy parameter measuring the relative fermi - momentum of electrons , i.e. @xmath21 . in the limits of very small and very large values of the relativity parameter , @xmath22",
    ", we obtain the well known non- and ultra - relativistic degeneracy pressures ( e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath23 using the scalings introduced above , the normalized hydrodynamics set of basic equations , including the quantum force effect , is written as @xmath24 where , @xmath25 is a measure of the relativistic degeneracy effects ( normalized relativity parameter ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , is the quantum diffraction coefficient which is related to the relativity parameter via @xmath28 . it is clearly confirmed that the quantum correction in this model is negligible even for higher values of relativity parameter .",
    "for instance , for the value of @xmath29 we obtain a quantum correction of order @xmath30 .",
    "it should also be noted that the relativity parameter , @xmath31 , ( using @xmath32 with @xmath33 the proton mass ) is related to the mass density through @xmath34 .",
    "taking , for instance , the density of typical white dwarfs to be in the range @xmath35 , results in typical values of @xmath36 for the relativity parameter .",
    "however , the current study does not limit the applicability of results to specific density range . now , neglecting the small contributing terms containing the ratio @xmath37 and assuming that @xmath38 , we are led to the following simplified set of normalized equations @xmath39 note , however , that the overall neutrality condition , @xmath40 , is met at @xmath41 . solving the basic equations ( eqs .",

    "however , this new expression contains more information about the electron dynamics as it contains an extra parameter which describes the relativistic dynamical properties of electrons ( electron relativistic fermi - momentum , i.e. @xmath21 ) in an ultra - dense plasma .",
    "it should be noted that the thomas - fermi approximation is valid only for slow variation of electrostatic potential and its application is limited for the ultradense plasmas where electron exchange potential can be dominant and one should appeal for the thomas - fermi - dirac approximation @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this model with respect to thomas - fermi is that the current model accounts for the whole range of relativity parameter the two limits of which leads to the well known non- and ultra relativistic degeneracy pressure limits given in eq .",

    "in such a condition we can obtain a potential maximum which describes the possibility of ipws propagation .    since , the sagdeev potential has triple roots , there is another possibility of obtaining double - layer ( dls ) or double - wells ( dws ) .",

    "a dw is condition in which rarefactive ( @xmath69 ) and compressive ( @xmath70 ) nonlinear excitations coexist .",

    "it is remarked that the increase / decrease in fractional electron concentration ( decrease / increase in relative dust concentration ) for rarefactive isws leads to increase / decrease in soliton amplitude / width , while for ipws this increase has only minor effects ( increase / decreases ) on the width / amplitude of the soliton . for ipws ,",
    "on the other hand , the increase of relative electron number - density leads to the decrease / increase of wave amplitude / width for both positive and negative potential ( @xmath69 ) waves .",

    "2(d ) reveals that the variation of relative electron concentration effects the rarefactive solitary excitation profiles more than that for compressive ones .",
    "it is also noted that the increase of @xmath71 on rarefactive and compressive solitary profiles , discussed in previous paragraph are quite similar to those of solitary - dws .    * in fig .",
    "3 we showed the variation allowed matching - speed range for isws with respect to the normalized plasma mass - density , @xmath72 , for the case of fermi - dirac plasma ( using the relation @xmath73 with @xmath74 ) which is obviously not possible for the case of the thomas - fermi plasma .",
    "it is remarked that , the speed range of possible propagation of isws increases as the normalized plasma mass - density increases for all values of the relative electron concentration .",
    "note that the numerical values of @xmath47 is much higher ( compared to the electron fermi - speed ) in here compared to that in ordinary non - degenerate plasmas .",
    "it is also revealed from figs .",
    "3(a)-3(d ) that the increases of the relative electron concentration in the fermi - dirac plasma leads to the increases in the allowed range of the matching speed . *",

    "it is further remarked from fig .",
    "3 that , there is a region for approximately @xmath75 for which no ipws are present and that this range is affected only slightly with the variation of the relativistic degeneracy parameter .",
    "however , as the parameter @xmath31 which represents the mass - density of the plasma increases the regions expand nearly in uniform manner and move to higher mach - number values .",
    "* finally , in fig . 5",
    ", we show the regions of existence for isws ( region in yellow labeled 4 ) and ipws ( region in red labeled 3 ) for the corresponding dusty plasma in thomas - fermi model .",
    "it is clearly remarked that , only two regions , namely compressive isws and negative potential ipws regions , are present in the case thomas - fermi dusty plasma . *",
    "the sagdeev pseudo - potential approach was used to investigate the propagation of nonlinear ion excitations in a dusty fermi - dirac electron - ion plasma with considering the effect of electron relativistic degeneracy .",
    "the matching criteria of existence of such solitary excitations were numerically investigated in terms of the relativity parameter , @xmath31 , the relative dust concentration , @xmath76 , and the allowed matching - speed , @xmath46 and there was found five distinct regions which accommodate a variety of nonlinear excitations .",
    "nonlinear double - wells and double - layers are also found to exist in such plasma .",
    "furthermore , it was confirmed that the relativistic degeneracy parameter has significant effect on the range of allowed matching - speed in dusty fermi - dirac plasmas .",
    "the current findings can be applicable to highly degenerate dense astrophysical compact objects such as white dwarfs .",
