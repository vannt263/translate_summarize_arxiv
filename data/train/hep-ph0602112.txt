    "the baryon spectra predicted by some quark models anticipate much more baryon resonances than the observed so far @xcite .",
    "these `` missing '' resonances are expected to have rather small couplings to the @xmath12 channel , and various reaction mechanisms have been suggested to search for those resonances .",
    "one of them is to use photoproduction processes containing mesons other than pion(s ) in the final state .",
    "for example , the photoproductions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the scattering off the nucleon may give us a clue on the existence of nucleon resonances that strongly couple to the kaon channel  @xcite .",
    "vector meson photoproduction , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 stands for a vector meson ( @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19 ) , may also be useful to identify the missing resonances  @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in @xmath0 vector meson photoproduction has been grown .",
    "this was initially triggered by the quark model which predicts that some nucleon resonances with higher mass can have sizable couplings with the @xmath4 channel  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are some preliminary experimental data from the clas collaboration at jefferson lab . on the reactions of @xmath4 photoproduction ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite production .",
    "these experiments show that the total cross sections for @xmath4 photoproduction , though small , are not so much suppressed than those for @xmath5 photoproduction , and it leads to the conclusion that full coupled - channel analyses to search for the resonances should include the @xmath4 channel as well  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to study the production mechanisms of @xmath4 photoproduction .    at present , theoretical works to understand the @xmath4 photoproduction reactions",

    "this can provide a platform for future investigation of nucleon resonances that can also contribute to this reaction near the threshold .",

    "it is well - known that introducing the form factors that depend on the momentum and mass of the exchanged particle violates the charge conservation condition , @xmath167 unless the production amplitude is transverse by itself .",
    "for example , in the reaction of @xmath1 , the @xmath3-channel @xmath4 exchange , @xmath7-channel nucleon term , and the contact term separately violate the charge - conservation condition but their sum does not .",
