    "the past two decades have witnessed remarkable progress in experimental and theoretical studies of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "nonlinear matter - wave structures have been one of the significant subjects considered in this context @xcite . from the theoretical viewpoint",
    ", the emergence of such structures can be understood in the framework of the well - established mean - field approximation , based on the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "in particular , for attractive ( repulsive ) interatomic interactions , this equation predicts the existence of bright ( dark ) matter - wave solitons , which have been observed in a series of experiments , see refs .",
    "@xcite and dark1,dark2,dark3,dark4,hamburg , hambcol , kip , technion , draft6 , respectively .",
    "bright gap solitons are also possible in bec with repulsive interactions loaded into an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "an important element in the studies of bec is the variety of external potentials that may be used to confine the ultracold atomic gases .",
    "the most typical forms of such trapping potentials are the harmonic - oscillator traps and optical lattices , i.e. , periodic potentials created by the interference of counter - propagating laser beams .",
    "a similar situation is relevant also in the context of nonlinear optics , where the basic model , namely the nonlinear schrdinger equation , may incorporate harmonic or periodic potentials describing graded - index waveguides and periodic waveguiding arrays , respectively @xcite .",
    "a combination of harmonic and periodic traps may be used to create a double - well potential ( dwp ) , which has drawn a great deal of attention .",
    "becs confined in dwps were studied experimentally in refs .",
    "@xcite , and many theoretical works addressed this setting @xcite .",
    "a fundamental effect studied , in diverse forms , in these works , is the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of the population of atoms in the two symmetric wells .",
    "a related work was done in nonlinear optics , where twin - core self - guided laser beams in kerr media @xcite , optically induced dual - core waveguiding structures in photorefractive crystals @xcite , and trapped light beams in an annular core of an optical fiber @xcite among others , also lead to manifestations of phenomenology associated with dwps .",
    "in addition to the studies of the ssb in the static dwp settings , the analysis was extended to diverse situations with the dwp subject to  management \" , i.e. , its parameters , such the depth of the well or height of the barrier between them , were made periodically varying functions of time @xcite .",
    "in fact , in all those works the analysis was based on a two - mode approximation , which replaces the underlying gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) by a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "apart from the variety in the shapes of the potentials , another important tool for manipulations of bec is provided by magnetically koehler , feshbachna or optically @xcite induced feshbach resonance , which makes it possible to control the effective nonlinearity in the condensate .",
    "the latter possibility has given rise to many theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "a well - known example is the formation of bright matter - wave solitons and soliton trains in @xmath0li @xcite and @xmath1rb @xcite condensates , by switching the interatomic interactions from repulsive to attractive .",
    "many theoretical works studied the bec dynamics under temporal and/or spatial modulation of the nonlinearity .",
    "in particular , the application of such a  feshbach resonance management  ( frm ) technique in the temporal domain can be used to stabilize attractive higher - dimensional bec against collapse isaac , frm1 , and to create robust matter - wave breathers in the effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) condensate @xcite . on the other hand , the so - called  collisionally inhomogeneous condensates , controlled by the spatially modulated nonlinearity ,",
    "have been predicted to support a variety of new effects , such as the adiabatic compression of matter - waves @xcite , bloch oscillations of matter - wave solitons @xcite , atomic soliton emission and atom lasers @xcite , dynamical trapping of matter - wave solitons @xcite , enhancement of transmissivity of matter - waves through barriers @xcite , stable condensates exhibiting both attractive and repulsive interatomic interactions @xcite , the delocalization transition  @xcite , ssb in a nonlinear double - well pseudopotential @xcite , the competition between incommensurable linear and nonlinear lattices @xcite , and others .    in this work",
    "we combine the two above - mentioned settings , namely the dwp and a time - modulated nonlinearity , in the 1d geometry , with the objective to control the ssb in the double - well setting by means of the frm .",
    "our model is based on the corresponding gpe , see eqs .",
    "( [ 1d ] ) and ( [ u1d ] ) below .",
    "we consider the nonlinearity which may either be repulsive or attractive on the average . in the case of the repulsive interactions , we find that the use of the frm results in the onset of spontaneous self - trapping of the bec in one of the two potential wells , while without the application of the frm atoms oscillate between the wells , i.e. , the condensate is untrapped .",
    "we also find that , when the self - trapping occurs , the trapped bec undergoes small - amplitude intrinsic oscillations at a frequency equal to half the nonlinearity - modulation frequency , which indicates the role of a parametric resonance in this case , when the densities are sufficiently low . in the case of the attractive nonlinearity",
    ", the frm - induced  effect turns out to be the opposite : while the unmanaged condensate is spontaneously trapped in one of the two potential wells , the application of the frm leads to its detrapping ( dynamical _ symmetry restoration _ ) , with the density oscillations between the wells at a frequency which is almost exactly a quarter of the driving frequency for low density cases .",
    "thus , for either nonlinearity ( repulsive or attractive ) , our results show that the frm can control the bec  dynamics in dwps , by inducing trapping / detrapping and intrinsic oscillations , which do not take place in the absence of the frm .",
    "our numerical results , obtained in the framework of the gpe model , are also corroborated by a semi - analytical approximation .",
    "in particular , we extend the analytical approximation presented in refs .",
    "@xcite to the frm - driven setting under consideration : we adopt a galerkin - type expansion to describe the evolution of the wavefunctions at each well of the dwp .",
    "this leads to a non - autonomous system of odes , which are solved numerically . in all cases ,",
    "the ode result is compared to the one obtained by the gpe model and , in most cases , they are found to be in fairly good agreement .",
    "it is relevant to mention that a similar physical model was recently introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was postulated that , under the action of the frm driving , the dwp was described by a system of linearly coupled odes corresponding to the above - mentioned two - mode approximation . however , dynamical regimes studied in ref .",
    "@xcite were fairly different from those considered here .",
    "the analysis reported in that work demonstrated an frm - induced transition from untrapped oscillations to a trapped state , but this was observed in the _ high - frequency _ regime , and was explained by means of an averaging method . in the present work , the transition to the trapping is clearly accounted for by a parametric resonance at _ moderate _ values of the frm frequency @xmath2 . of the underlying gpe . on the other hand , the ode system used in ref .",
    "@xcite can not explain the parametric resonance ( clearly , a more sophisticated approximation is needed to capture the resonant mechanism ) .",
    "another difference is that we observe the frm - induced trapping and _ detrapping _ effects ( the latter was not reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the regime of relatively weak frm , when the time - dependent nonlinearity coefficient , @xmath3 , does not change its sign . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the opposite regime of the strong management was considered .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model , and present the results for the repulsive and attractive nonlinearity in sections iii and iv , respectively .",
    "section v concludes the paper .",
    "in the mean - field approximation , the combination of the dwp and time - varying nonlinearity is described by the gpe for the macroscopic wavefunction @xmath4 , written in the scaled form : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the chemical potential , while the dwp is taken in the form of @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the normalized strength of the harmonic trap , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote , respectively , the amplitude and width of the barrier used ( in combination with the parabolic trap ) to create the dwp .",
    "finally , the frm modulation function @xmath3 is taken in the customary form @xcite , @xmath11    the same model may be interpreted in terms of nonlinear optics , with @xmath12 being the propagation distance , @xmath6 the propagation constant , and @xmath3 representing a periodic modulation of the kerr coefficient @xcite . in that case , potential ( [ u1d ] ) defines two waveguiding channels in a planar medium .",
    "we aim to study localized frm - driven states in the 1d setting described by eqs .",
    "( [ 1d ] ) and ( [ u1d ] ) .",
    "in particular , we numerically solve the above model with initial conditions of the form of either an antisymmetric ( with respect to the two wells ) initial state and @xmath13 ( the self - repulsive nonlinearity , on the average ) , or a symmetric state and @xmath14 ( i.e. , the nonlinearity which is self - attractive , on the average ) .",
    "this choice stems from the fact that both configurations are well known to feature the ssb , in the absence of the  management \" @xcite .",
    "numerical results , which are reported below , were obtained by means of the split - step fourier method .",
    "we use the following values of parameters which adequately represent the generic situation : the effective parabolic trap strength @xmath8 assumes value @xmath15 , the chemical potential , @xmath6 , ranges from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , the barrier s width is @xmath18 , and its height is @xmath19 . as concerns the nonlinearity - modulation function , @xmath3 , the ",
    "dc value  @xmath20 is taken as @xmath21 for the repulsive or attractive interatomic interactions , respectively , while the modulation strength , @xmath22 , varies in the interval of @xmath23 .",

    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ beq3 ] ) into eq .",

    "detailed analysis of the resonances that may explain the character of the frm - induced trapping and detrapping is a nontrivial problem , because the two - mode approximation , such as the one presented above or the one recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is insufficient for this purpose .",
    "the development of a more sophisticated finite - mode approximation , that may help uncover the resonances , is a subject for a separate study .",
