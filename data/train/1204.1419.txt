    "cosmic inflation solves various problems in the standard big bang cosmology  @xcite and simultaneously provides the seed of large scale structure in our universe from the quantum fluctuation of a light scalar field , e.g. , inflaton field @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a single field inflation model predicts the density perturbation which is nearly scale - invariant and almost gaussian . in other words ,",
    "the scalar spectral index @xmath1 is close to unity and a non - linearity parameter @xmath2 is much less than unity  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the current limit on the local type non - linearity parameter @xmath3 from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) seven - year data , @xmath4 at the 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "however , besides canonical single field slow - roll inflation models , there are many possible mechanisms to generate density perturbation . by wmap data ,",
    "the scalar spectral index @xmath1 has been measured with a good accuracy , while the non - linearity parameters have been just weakly constrained as above .",
    "the sensitivity of the planck satellite  @xcite to measure non - gaussianity is as good as to probe @xmath2 of @xmath5 .",
    "the non - gaussianity could be an important observable to discriminate between various mechanisms of density perturbation generation .",
    "for example , multi - field inflation models can show large non - gaussianity with special conditions during inflation  @xcite , at the end of inflation  @xcite , preheating  @xcite , or deep in the radiation dominated era  @xcite .",
    "the last case includes the `` curvaton '' scenario  @xcite .",
    "a light scalar field , curvaton , has too little potential energy to drive inflationary expansion during inflation . at a later time when a curvaton decays ,",
    "the isocurvature perturbation of the curvaton field becomes adiabatic or mixed with that from the inflaton field .",
    "if the curvaton energy density is subdominant at its decay time , the large non - gaussianity is generated in general  @xcite .",
    "since an inflaton also generates density perturbations , inflaton and curvaton contributions to density perturbation could be comparable .",
    "this mixed inflaton - curvaton scenario has been also studied intensively  @xcite .",
    "the quantum fluctuation of a subdominant light scalar field during inflation can modulate the efficiency of reheating by the inflaton decay  @xcite .",
    "this makes the reheating a spatially inhomogeneous process .",
    "the quasi - scale invariant perturbations of this field , which are isocurvature modes during inflation , may be converted into the primordial curvature perturbation during this process .",
    "large non - gaussianity also can be induced from modulated reheating  @xcite . for a review of modulated reheating after inflation ,",
    "see for example ref .",
    "again , in general , the density fluctuation can be generated by both inflaton and modulated reheating .",
    "mixed inflaton - modulated reheating scenario also has been investigated  @xcite .    here",
    "one may realize that a curvaton is a light scalar field and thus naturally can play the role of a scalar field which modulates the reheating by the inflaton decay .",
    "the inflaton field may have a coupling with a curvaton if that is small enough not to disturb dynamics of both an inflaton and a curvaton .",
    "nevertheless this interaction modifies the decay rate of the inflaton field .",
    "since the decay rate of inflaton becomes a function of the local value of a curvaton field @xmath6 , this gives rise to a perturbation in the decay rate of the inflaton field and thus in the reheating temperature which is responsible for the density perturbation after reheating .",
    "so far few attention has been paid to couplings between the inflaton and the curvaton  @xcite , compared to self - interaction of curvatons  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we incorporate the modulated reheating effects in the curvaton scenario , taking the perturbation generated from the inflaton field also into account .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after describing the model and its dynamics in section  [ dynamics ] , we consider the curvature perturbation and calculate the power spectrum , the tensor - to - scalar ratio and non - linearity parameters in section  [ perturbation ] . in section  [ models ]",
    "we work on simple models and show how the modulated reheating effect by curvaton affects the density perturbation and parameter space of models can be constrained .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "inflation is driven by the potential energy of the inflaton field , @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that during inflation interaction terms of inflaton with other fields are negligible .",
    "however after inflation , the inflaton starts oscillating around the minimum and finally , via the interaction terms , decays into the standard model ( sm ) particles , which makes the hot thermal plasma in the standard big bang cosmology .",
    "one of the relevant terms for the decay of inflaton field including curvaton field @xmath7 could be given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is another light scalar field such as the sm higgs field .",
    "then , in the classical background of curvaton field , eq .  ( [ phisigmainteraction ] ) induces the decay of inflaton into two higgs scalars , with the curvaton expectation value dependent ( cd ) decay width @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the inflaton mass at the minimum .",
    "together with the other curvaton independent interactions such as @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes a sm operator , induce the curvaton independent ( ci ) decay width of the inflaton , @xmath14 .",
    "the total decay rate of the inflaton is given by @xmath15 for the very light curvaton field , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being curvaton mass , the curvaton starts to oscillate in the radiation - dominated epoch well after the inflaton decays , when the hubble parameter becomes as small as @xmath18 .",
    "after the reheating by the inflaton @xmath0 is completed , the energy density of the radiation from inflaton decay decreases as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a scale factor when inflaton decays , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "the energy density of the curvaton after the onset of the oscillations decreases as @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the expectation value of curvaton during inflation and @xmath24 is a scale factor when the curvaton start oscillation at @xmath25 .",
    "the curvaton decays at a later time and we call its decay rate @xmath26 . whether the universe is curvaton dominated or radiation dominated at the moment of curvaton decay depends on the size of @xmath26 and @xmath23 .",
    "we consider that inflaton @xmath0 and curvaton @xmath7 fields are relevant to the density perturbation in the early universe .",
    "their vacuum fluctuations are promoted to a classical perturbation around the time of horizon exit . during inflation the field trajectory is dominated by the inflaton field and thus the inflaton perturbation becomes adiabatic and that of the curvaton contributes to the isocurvature mode .",
    "reheating of the universe is attained from the decay of the inflaton field @xmath0 . since the inflaton decay is modulated by the curvaton field @xmath7",
    ", the curvature perturbation of the radiation produced from the decay of inflaton has two origins .",
    "one comes from the inflaton field itself in the standard picture of the generation of fluctuations .",
    "the other comes from the light scalar field ( curvaton ) @xmath7 during the reheating process due to the interaction between the inflaton and the curvaton field .",
    "thus , as in the inflaton - modulated reheating mixed scenario , it is written  @xcite as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a function of @xmath29 calculated at a time @xmath30 which is after several oscillations of the inflaton but well before the time of decay of inflaton .",
    "a quantity with @xmath31 is evaluated when the corresponding scale crosses the hubble horizon during inflation .    during inflation",
    "the energy density of @xmath7 field is negligible and the inflation is driven by the inflaton field @xmath0 alone .",
    "the slow - roll parameters during inflation are defined by @xmath32 using eq .",
    "( [ slow - roll ] ) , the curvature perturbation of radiation @xmath33 is expressed as @xmath34 with @xmath35      after inflaton decay , the energy density of radiation decreases , however the curvaton energy density stays the same for a while and starts to decrease when the mass of curvaton becomes larger than the hubble expansion . since the energy density of oscillating curvaton decreases slower than that of radiation , the curvaton becomes important well after the decay of inflaton .",
    "when the decay rate of curvaton @xmath36 becomes comparable to the hubble expansion rate , the curvaton @xmath7 decays quickly to radiation .",
    "after the decay of the curvaton , the remnant radiation is a mixture from the inflaton and curvaton decay products with different density perturbations . in this inflaton - curvaton mixed scenario , the curvature perturbation after the curvaton decay can be expressed as analytically with instant decay approximation by  @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39 here @xmath40 is given in eq .",

    "as one can see , in the limit of @xmath57 , the usual curvaton contribution disappears and it corresponds to the inflaton - modulated mixed scenario .",
    "the opposite limit with @xmath58 corresponds to the pure curvaton scenario .",
    "whereas the @xmath42 parametrizes the @xmath7 contribution as the curvaton compared with the other two , the @xmath7 contribution via the modulated inflaton decay is parametrized by @xmath59 .",

    "the power spectrum comes solely from the inflaton , while in the limit of @xmath62 the @xmath7 field contributes dominantly through the modulated effect and/or the curvaton effect with the inflaton effect suppressed .",

    "<S> in addition , if the inflaton decay rate depends on the light scalar field expectation value by interactions between them , density perturbations could be generated by the quantum fluctuation of the light field when the inflaton decays . this is modulated reheating mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we study curvature perturbation in models where a light scalar field does not only play a role of curvaton but also induce modulated reheating at the inflaton decay . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the non - linearity parameters as well as the scalar spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a parameter region where non - linearity parameters are also significantly enhanced by the cancellation between the modulated effect and the curvaton contribution . </S>",
    "<S> for the simple quadratic potential model of both inflaton and curvaton , both tensor - to - scalar ratio and nonlinearity parameters could be simultaneously large . </S>"
