    "for example , bonatti , daz , and pujals @xcite proved that the robust absence of the dominated splitting on a homoclinic class implies the @xmath0-newhouse phenomenon , i.e. , locally generic coexistence of infinitely many sinks or sources . furthermore , in @xcite , bonatti and daz showed , under the robust absence of dominated splitting and some conditions on the jacobians , a homoclinic class exhibits very complicated dynamics named _",

    "the problem we pursue in this article is the following : _ does the robust absence of dominated splittings give some restrictions on its index set ? _",
    "let us state our main result .",
    "for @xmath4 and @xmath81 , @xmath27 is is said to be _ wild _ if it is robustly non - dominated , more precisely , there exists a neighborhood @xmath86 of @xmath5 such that for every @xmath87 , the continuation @xmath32 is defined and @xmath88 does not admit any kind of dominated splittings .",
    "here is a partial answer to this question .",
    "[ mainth ] for @xmath0-generic diffeomorphisms of a three - dimensional closed smooth manifold , if there exists a wild homoclinic class @xmath27 that contains an index - one volume - expanding hyperbolic periodic point , then @xmath89 .",
    "let us see an immediate corollary of this theorem .    for @xmath0-generic diffeomorphisms of a three - dimensional closed smooth manifold , if there exists a wild homoclinic class that contains two hyperbolic periodic points such tha one of them is volume - expanding and the other is volume - contracting",
    ". then @xmath90 .",
    "thus , under some assumptions on jacobian , there does exist a restriction on the index of periodic points inside wild homoclinic classes .",
    "this theorem can be interpreted as a qualification of homoclinic classes to be `` basic pieces . '' to explain this , let us review the intuitive idea of @xcite : the wildness of a homoclinic class scatters its hyperbolicity to any direction .",
    "thus by using their technique , it is not difficult to prove that , under the wildness , one can create an index bifurcation by an arbitrarily small perturbation .",
    "however , this argument does not tell us whether the bifurcation happens inside the homoclinic class or not . if homoclinic classes are to deserve as basic pieces , then it is desireble that a phenomenon which local ( linear algebraic ) information implies to happen can be observed inside the original homoclinic classes .",
    "theorem [ mainth ] says that the bifurcation problem we discussed above is `` well localized '' in homoclinic classes .",
    "let us reintroduce our theorem from a different viewpoint .",
    "aiming at the global understanding of @xmath0-dynamical systems , palis suggested the famous palis conjecture ( see @xcite ) , that is , every ( @xmath0- ) diffeomorphism away from axiom a and no - cycle diffeomorphisms can be approximated by a diffeomorphism with heterodimensional cycle or homoclinic tangency .",
    "recently , bonatti and daz asked a stronger version of this conjecture :    let @xmath1 be a smooth closed manifold .",
    "does there exist a @xmath0-open and dense subset @xmath91 such that every @xmath92 either verifies the axiom a and the no - cycle condition or has a @xmath0-robust heterodimensional cycle .",
    "our study gives a partial answer to this question .",
    "in fact , we can prove the following :    [ npalis ] let @xmath5 be a @xmath0-diffeomorphism of a three - dimensional closed smooth manifold .",
    "if @xmath5 has a wild homoclinic class that contains an index-1 volume - expanding hyperbolic periodic point , then @xmath5 can be approximated by a diffeomorphism with a robust heterodimensional cycle .",
    "note that wen @xcite and gourmelon @xcite already gave positive answers to the palis conjecture under similar hypothesis .",
    "the novelity of our results is that we can create a _ connection between two saddles_. roughly speaking , outside axiom a diffeomorphisms with no - cycles , by linear algebraic arguments and franks lemma , it is not difficult to create an index bifurcation with an arbitrarily small perturbation . on the other hand , in general",
    "it is difficult to create a cycle between two saddles , since we need the information about the reccurence between two saddles .",
    "our proof suggests one senario to create a connection between two saddles .    in this article , we confined our attention to three - dimensional cases .",
    "let us see what happens the other dimensions . in dimension two , it is easy to determine @xmath93 .",
    "it is @xmath94 ( sink ) , @xmath95 ( source ) , or @xmath96 .",
    "note that there is no example of wild homoclinic classes in dimension two ( in @xmath0-topology ) .",
    "if one can construct such a homoclinic class , it serves as a counter - example of the conjecture of smale about the density of the axiom a and no - cycle condition diffeomorphisms in @xmath0-topology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the study of higher dimensional cases are of natural interest .",
    "so far , the complete solution of the higher dimensional cases are not obtained . in @xcite",
    ", the author gave an example of generically wild homoclinic classes on four dimensional manifold whose index set exhibits an _ index deficiency _ in a robust fashion ( for the precise definition , see @xcite ) .",
    "the example of the homoclinic class that satisfies the assumption of the theorem can be found in @xcite .",
    "as far as i know , this is the only mechanism that assures the wildness of some homoclinic classes .",
    "thus it is interesting to study whether there is another mechanism that leads the creation of a wild homoclinic class .",
    "for example , the following question is interesting to study :    can one find @xmath4 ( @xmath97 ) such that for some hyperbolic periodic point @xmath10 , @xmath27 is wild and robustly @xmath98 ?    finally , let us see the organization of this article . in section [ outline ] , we introduce our strategy for the proofs of theorem [ mainth ] and [ npalis ] .",
    "we also furnish some part of their proof .",
    "the rest of the proofs are given in section [ cretan ] and section [ biftan ] .",
    "more explanation on the contents of section [ cretan ] and section [ biftan ] can be found at the end of the section [ outline ] .",
    "in this section , we see the strategy for the proof of theorem [ mainth ] and [ npalis ] .",
    "first , we explain how we will prove theorem [ npalis ] .",

    "roughly speaking , the first proposition states that , under the robust absence of dominated splittings , one can create a homothetic tangency inside the homoclinic class by an arbitrarily small perturbation .",
