    "low mass ( m dwarf and cooler ) main sequence stars are by far the most numerous stars in the galaxy and make up most of its baryonic mass .",
    "however , there have been few detailed chemical abundance studies of these stars with spectra of sufficient resolution for atomic absorption lines to be measured individually .",
    "none of these included more than a few stars .",
    "this was largely a result of their low intrinsic luminosity and the molecular lines present in their spectra .",
    "their faintness meant that few of these stars were bright enough for high signal to noise , high resolution spectra to be measured easily without a large telescope .",
    "the molecular bands present in their spectra complicated the calculation of stellar model atmospheres and cause line blends which make it difficult to measure atomic line strengths in large regions of the visible spectrum .",
    "there have been abundance studies which used photometry or which fitted broad molecular features in low - resolution spectra of m and k dwarfs , but their results are not as certain as they would be if they were calibrated with stars for which more precise abundances were based on higher - resolution spectra .",
    "there have also been studies which used synthetic spectrum fitting of low resolution spectra to measure metallicities of low mass dwarfs .",
    "these have given rough metallicity estimates , but have not produced elemental abundances with the precision which is possible using higher resolution spectra .",
    "recent advances in model atmospheres of low mass dwarf stars , largely as a result of the improved treatment of molecular opacity , have provided the opportunity to determine abundances of m and k dwarf stars through analysis of their atomic spectral lines .",
    "our study of chemical abundances in kapteyn s star ( hd 33793 ) @xcite showed us that it is possible to locate spectral regions in these stars where molecular bands are not present or are sufficiently weak for accurate equivalent widths of atomic lines to be measured .",
    "the survey of abundance estimates we report here will provide some of the data necessary to calibrate metallicity indices for cool dwarf stars , for example the tio and cah indices of @xcite and @xcite . with calibrated indices it should be possible to estimate the metallicity of a much larger number of cool dwarfs , including those too distant and faint to study using high resolution spectra .",
    "when a large volume - limited sample is available , it will be possible to determine if the ` g dwarf problem ' @xcite continues to lower - mass main sequence stars so that low - metallicity m dwarfs are more scarce than expected in our galaxy .",
    "we selected stars for observation to cover a large range of metallicity : low metallicity stars are overrepresented in our sample compared to the actual number in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we increased the number of low metallicity stars by choosing to observe stars with high radial velocities , which increased the likelihood of observing halo stars , and by observing stars with tio5 indices @xcite which indicate weak tio band strengths .",
    "our spectrum of kapteyn s star was measured with the echelle spectrograph of the 4.0-m victor m. blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory as described in @xcite .",
    "the 34 other stars were observed using the echelle spectrograph of the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5-meter telescope .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines to subtract the bias , divide by flat field spectra , reduce the echelle orders to one dimensional spectra , and apply thar lamp spectrum wavelength calibration .",
    "the spectrum of a hot , high @xmath2 star was used to correct for telluric absorption lines where appropriate and possible .",
    "the spectral resolution of the apo spectra is about @xmath3 , as measured using the thar comparison lines .",
    "there are no gaps in wavelength between echelle orders .",
    "the usable spectrum covers the range from about 9800   to where the measured signal from these red stars drops off in the blue , normally below 5000  . for most stars ,",
    "the signal to noise ratio in the region of the lines we used for the analysis was at least 100 per pixel .",
    "it was much higher for the brighter stars ( @xmath4 ) in our sample .",
    "for the faintest star , lhs 364 , we were only able to achieve a signal to noise ratio of about 50 with the observation time available .",
    "as we found in our analysis of kapteyn s star , the chemical abundances we derive for these low - temperature dwarf stars depends strongly on the metallicity of the model atmosphere used .",
    "for example , changing the metallicity of the model atmosphere with @xmath5  k and @xmath6 by @xmath7 dex can changes the fe abundance derived using the equivalent widths measured for kapteyn s star by @xmath8 dex . determining the physical parameters to use for the model atmospheres",
    "is therefore an iterative process .",
    "fortunately , the iteration converges so it is possible to find the value where the metallicity derived equals the metallicity of the model atmosphere used in the analysis .",
    "we integrated the flux in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 filters for a grid of synthetic spectra released with the nextgen models ( hauschildt , allard , & baron 1999 ) to produce theoretical colour - temperature relation estimates .",
    "we obtained @xmath10 and @xmath11 magnitudes from the 2mass point source catalog @xcite and @xmath9 from @xcite and used these to find @xmath12 and @xmath13 temperatures for our stars .",
    "we used the average of the two as @xmath14 in our models .",
    "we note that while there are few other published determinations of temperatures in the stars we observed , we were happy to see that the temperature we derive for hd  88230 , @xmath15  k , is in good agreement with the temperature derived by @xcite , @xmath16  k , using its bolometric flux and its measured angular diameter .    for stars",
    "where parallax data was available we calculated absolute @xmath10 and @xmath11 magnitudes .",
    "we used these to estimate the masses using the theoretical mass - luminosity relations plotted by @xcite .",
    "we calculated the bolometric correction @xmath17 from the @xmath18 and @xmath19 nextgen colours @xcite and used parallax , @xmath11 and @xmath17 to derive @xmath20 .",
    "we then used @xmath20 , mass , and @xmath14 to calculate @xmath21 : @xmath22 where we have used @xmath23  k , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is in solar masses . for stars where parallax measurements were unavailable we assumed @xmath27 .",
    "gravity does not have an effect on the derived chemical abundances as large as the effects of temperature or model metallicity : accepting this large gravity uncertainty does not produce a large uncertainty in the abundances .",
    "the parallaxes and magnitudes used to derive the stellar physical parameters are listed in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "spectral types are included in the table to give a rough idea of how low resolution spectra of the stars appear : the temperatures and gravities derived for the stars and reported in table  [ t2 ] are more physically meaningful .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,>,^,>,^,>,^,>,>,^ \" , ]",
    "we have calculated the fe and ti abundances of 35 m and k dwarf stars using atomic line equivalent widths measured using spectra with high spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we believe this more than triples the number of dwarf stars in the temperature range of our sample for which chemical abundances have been measured using atomic lines .",
    "our abundance estimates should be more reliable than those of previous studies because we have used updated model atmospheres which include molecular opacity data which is more complete than what was available in any previous models .",
    "the stars we studied have temperatures between 3300 and 4700 k , with a median temperature of 3950 k. they have [ fe / h ] abundances between @xmath28 and @xmath29 the abundance ratio [ ti / fe ] decreases with increasing [ fe / h ] , showing a trend similar to what has been observed for ti and other @xmath30-elements in warmer stars @xcite .    the previous studies using atomic lines and high resolution spectra to measure abundances in dwarf stars in the temperature range of our stars are sparse and included few stars .",
    "@xcite studied kapteyn s star .",
    "he reported @xmath31 = -0.5 \\pm 0.3 $ ] , which is 0.5 dex larger than our result .",
    "@xcite studied six m and k dwarfs using two fe  i lines .",
    "one star , hd 95735 ( gl 411 ) , was also included in our study .",
    "the fe abundance we derived for the star is 0.42 or 0.57 dex smaller , depending on which gravity savanov used .",
    "several researchers have estimated metallicities of low mass dwarfs by fitting synthetic spectra to low resolution observed spectra , @xmath32 , which included atomic and molecular lines @xcite .",
    "the spectra were for the most part in the near infrared .",
    "the metallicities derived were not determined as precisely as is possible using higher resolution spectra , but the method shows what analysis is possible for fainter stars where low resolution spectra are all that is available .    the trend we see in [ ti / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] is similar to that seen for warmer stars in the galaxy .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] compares our data to the abundances found by @xcite , who observed field halo and disk stars , most of which are dwarf stars between 5000 and 6500 k. we have made the correction necessary to account for the different assumed solar abundances .",
    "our abundance values do not appear out of place among the larger set , although our average [ ti / fe ] is higher by about 0.1 dex at most [ fe / h ] values .",
    "we see a similar relation between our data and that compiled by @xcite .",
    "the similar [ ti / fe ] trend was expected since stars of all masses are presumably made from clouds with the same compositions .    because we selected stars for observation to cover a wide range of metallicity , rather than to statistically represent",
    "the low mass dwarfs in a given volume , our results say nothing about the relative numbers of stars with different metallicities",
    ".    one goal of this work will be to find a combination of photometric and low - resolution spectral indices which can be used to determine the metallicity of these low mass dwarfs , and to calibrate this method using our observationally determined metallicities . because the molecular band strengths measured by the spectral indices depend on both the chemical composition and the temperature of a star , the method will need to be sensitive to both properties .",
    "we plan to obtain low resolution spectra of the stars in our list for which tio and cah indices have not been measured .    by compiling a statistically significant sample of observationally calibrated metallicity estimates for low mass dwarfs it will be possible to determine the metallicity distribution of these stars in the galaxy",
    ". this will provide observational evidence of whether there is a k and m dwarf problem in our galaxy similar to the g dwarf problem , where low - metallicity stars are more scarce than predicted by galactic star formation and chemical evolution models .",
    "the answer to this question , positive or negative , will provide important constraints for models of the chemical enrichment of the galaxy .",
