    "<S> a simple modification of the `` wang - landau sampling '' algorithm removes the systematic error that occurs at the boundary of the range of energy over which the random walk takes place in the original algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> in two recent papers @xcite an efficient monte carlo procedure was introduced that used a random walk in energy space to obtain an accurate estimate of the energy density of states @xmath0 for classical statistical models . </S>",
    "<S> if this method ( now commonly termed `` wang - landau sampling '' ) is applied to a restricted energy range , effects at the boundaries of the energy range come into play , and systematically larger errors in @xmath0 at the edges of the sampled energy interval are observed . since the method is of quite general applicability , a better understanding of these `` edge '' effects could be of considerable value . here , we show how such an enhancement of errors at the edges can be avoided by a simple modification of the algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> in wang - landau sampling one accepts trial configurations with probability @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the energy density of states ( dos ) and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the energies of the current and the proposed configuration , respectively . at each spin flip trial the dos </S>",
    "<S> is modified @xmath4 by means of a modification factor @xmath5 , which is systematically reduced according to @xmath6 whenever the recorded energy histogram @xmath7 becomes sufficiently flat that all entries are within some percentage @xmath8 of the average energy histogram , i.e. , @xmath9 for all @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 is then reset to zero , and the procedure is repeated until a flat @xmath7 is achieved using a final modification factor @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> restricting now the random walk to some sub - interval of the entire energy range of the system , one has obviously two basic choices to proceed in case the random walk is at the border of the considered energy interval and a spin flip trial would result in an energy outside the specified energy segment :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> reject the suggested spin flip and do not update @xmath0 and the energy histogram @xmath7 of the current energy level @xmath2 [ itm1 ] 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> reject the suggested spin flip and count the current energy level once more , i.e. , update @xmath0 and @xmath7 : @xmath4 and @xmath11 [ itm2 ]    method [ itm1 ] was used in refs . @xcite and this led to a systematic underestimation of @xmath0 at borders of energy intervals and @xmath12 of a specified interval @xmath13 $ ] have been updated twice in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , when visited by the random walk . ] . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was examined for the two - dimensional ising model , with linear dimension @xmath14 and for three different ranges of allowed energies : @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath16 $ ] , as well as @xmath17 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the results showed that systematic deviations from the exact dos occurred only at     in @xmath0 for the first @xmath18 energy levels of a two - dimensional nearest neighbor ising model with linear dimension @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the energy scale was not normalized by the number of spins . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 was obtained by normalizing with respect to the groundstate , @xmath19 is an average over @xmath20 runs . </S>",
    "<S> we have used @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> [ edges ] ]     in @xmath0 for the interval @xmath23 $ ] of a two - dimensional nearest neighbor ising model with linear dimension @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the energy scale is not normalized by the number of spins . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 was obtained by normalizing with respect to the exact dos at the left edge ( @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is an average over @xmath25 runs . </S>",
    "<S> we have used @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> [ edges2 ] ]    the right edges of the energy intervals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since for the model at hand , this effect only influenced two energy levels directly at the border , the recipe used was to overlap the individual intervals over which @xmath0 was sampled by a sufficient number of energy levels so that the affected energy levels could be discarded from each when joining the dos afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry of this effect can be explained quite simply : for the chosen intervals , @xmath0 has its minimum at the left edge and increases monotonically as @xmath2 approaches the right edge . hence , during the simulation the random walk is `` pushed '' against the right edge of the sampled energy range , simply because generating configurations with energies higher than the right edge energy is more likely than generating configurations with energies lower than the boundary energy at left edges . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for each interval , a pronounced effect was only visible at the right edge . in order to demonstrate this </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated @xmath0 for the first @xmath18 levels of a @xmath14 two - dimensional ising model using single - spin - flip wang - landau sampling in both variants ( method [ itm1 ] and [ itm2 ] ) , as well as n - fold way updates , which are known not to produce an enhancement of errors at edges . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite the latter algorithm was tested concerning its behavior at edges against the original single - spin - flip version , whereby it was misleadingly stated that boundary effects occur when @xmath0 at edges is sampled the same way as inside the energy interval ( method [ itm2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is actually incorrect . from the simulation results , depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ edges ] , one clearly sees that method [ itm1 ] , which is almost identical to the implementation of wang - landau @xcite , leads to systematic errors in the density of states at the right edge ( indicated by a dashed line ) , where two levels are affected , as described in @xcite . when @xmath0 is sampled according to method [ itm2 ] , no systematic errors are present . in case the chosen interval is symmetric around @xmath26 , the effect should have the same magnitude for both edges of the interval , as can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ edges2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> again , no systematical enhancement of errors at edges is present when the dos is sampled using method [ itm2 ] . </S>"
