    "cooling of a macroscopic mechanical resonator to its quantum mechanical ground state has received immense experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite attention . the quest for quantum limited control of micro- or nanomechanical oscillators",
    "is motivated by fundamental interest @xcite as well as possible applications in quantum information @xcite and precision measurement @xcite . despite these promising and significant experimental and theoretical efforts , to date occupation numbers below 1",
    "have not been achieved .",
    "one can distinguish roughly three routes towards cooling of a nanomechanical resonator down to the quantum regime , which have been proposed or partly demonstrated : passive optical cooling @xcite , active optical feedback cooling @xcite and cooling via coupling to a different heavily damped solid state system , such as a superconducting single electron transistor @xcite , a quantum dot @xcite , a cooper - pair box @xcite or a flux qubit @xcite .",
    "for passive optical cooling it was shown theoretically in @xcite that cooling to the quantum mechanical ground state is possible . experimental work @xcite impressively demonstrated this cooling method , but did not achieve the ground state due to insufficient laser phase noise stabilization .    for nanomechanical resonators coupled to superconducting circuits less",
    "is known about ground state cooling , despite recent experimental achievements : it has been shown in @xcite that it is possible to integrate a nanoresonator into small superconducting circuits and to excite only a single mode of the resonator motion .",
    "also , cooling effects have been demonstrated by coupling to single - electron transistors @xcite and superconducting microwave cavities @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    ", @xcite showed in a fully quantum mechanical treatment that it is possible to reach the ground state for mechanical frequencies above @xmath0 via capacitive coupling to a cooper - pair box .",
    "for other circuit setups a quantum treatment @xcite predicts cooling , but final occupation numbers beyond the ground state .",
    "cooling effects were also predicted with semi - classical approaches in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform a full quantum mechanical treatment proving that ground state cooling is possible for nanomechanical resonators coupled via lorentz force to a loop - shaped cooper - pair box qubit .",
    "the loop - shaped cooper - pair box was originally introduced to allow for qubit state read - out at an optimal working point @xcite , where the qubit eigenstates correspond to clockwise and anti - clockwise currents which can be excited and measured .",
    "we investigate the conditions for ground - state cooling of the flexural beam motion , using the decay @xmath1 of the excited cooper - pair box qubit state to dissipate the resonator energy . with carefully chosen qubit - drive detuning , energy moves from the resonator motion to the qubit , which acts as an additional reservoir at a lower effective temperature .",
    "we find that the final occupation number crucially depends on the initial thermal occupation @xmath2 of the resonator mode and the dimensionless parameter @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the intrinsic dissipation rate of the resonator and @xmath5 the resonator - qubit coupling strength .",
    "most efficient cooling is achieved for large @xmath6 , which corresponds to the strong coupling regime of cavity qed .",
    "our analysis shows that cooling is optimized in the strong - drive regime for the qubit , and ground state cooling is possible even for 10 mhz mechanical frequency .",
    "our quantum mechanical model is developed in close analogy to the description of laser cooling of trapped ions @xcite .",
    "the basic working principle there is that a fast , dissipative dynamics of the internal degree of freedom couples weakly to the motional degree of freedom and provides an effective dissipative evolution for the latter .",
    "this is translated here to the solid state context , where the cpb takes over the role of internal electronic levels and the mechanical resonator corresponds to the ion motion in a harmonic trapping potential , as was done in @xcite .",
    "readers not so familiar with the quantum optical techniques of master equations and adiabatic elimination based on projector operator formalism will find many useful details of calculations in the appendix to this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ setupsection ]",
    "we present the nanoresonator beam and the cpb circuit , and derive the lorentz force interaction term .",
    "section [ coolingsection ] is devoted to a quantum mechanical derivation of the cooling equation , starting from a master equation of the full system . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the cooling rate and the final occupation number of the resonator motion in various parameter regimes , before we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper we study a nanomechanical resonator beam integrated into a loop - shaped cooper - pair box ( cpb ) circuit , with the goal to derive conditions for ground - state cooling of a flexural mode of the nanoresonator via the lorentz force .",
    "the cpb circuit here acts as a dissipative two - level system ( qubit ) which removes energy during the cooling process . in this section",
    "we present a model for the motion of the nanoresonator and describe the cpb circuit with the integrated mechanical beam . the system hamiltonian consists of three parts , @xmath7 where @xmath8 describes the dynamics of the nanoresonator , @xmath9 represents the driven cpb qubit and @xmath10 describes the interaction between the motion of the nanoresonator and the cpb qubit .",
    "the coupling to the environment will be included using a master equation formalism .",
    "the nanomechanical resonator @xcite considered here is a quasi-1d beam of @xmath11-scale length that executes mechanical oscillations . in this setup",
    "we consider a so - called doubly clamped beam - a beam fixed at both ends - which can undergo longitudinal , torsional and flexural oscillations .",
    "we are mainly interested in flexural oscillations . assuming a homogeneous rod , the frequency for the @xmath12-th mode of flexural oscillations is given by @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 is young s modulus , @xmath15 the density and @xmath16 is the cross section of the beam .",
    "@xmath17 is the bending moment for a beam of rectangular cross section of width @xmath18 and height @xmath19 , oscillating vertically .",
    "@xmath20 is a numerical factor which for the lowest mode is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the length @xcite . in the following",
    "we restrict our analysis to the lowest flexural mode , described by a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath8 , @xmath23 with @xmath24 the annihilation operator satisfying bosonic commutation relations @xmath25=1 $ ] . with the beam integrated into a superconducting circuit , we assume an aluminum construction with typical values @xmath26 gpa and @xmath27 . choosing a height @xmath28 nm and a length @xmath29 m , we get a typical frequency @xmath3010 mhz .",
    "note that the frequency does not depend on the width @xmath18 , but we have to choose @xmath31 since we treat the nanorod as a quasi-1d beam .",
    "the dynamics of the nanoresonator mode is further governed by coupling to phonons in the electrical circuit and by the residual coupling to all other modes .",
    "assuming that the lowest flexural mode is sufficiently well isolated , we model the effect of its environment as the interaction with a thermal bath , which can be treated in terms of an effective master equation @xcite with the liouvillian @xmath32 , @xmath33(\\rho ) + \\gamma_{\\rm m } n_{\\rm m } { \\cal d}[a^\\dag](\\rho ) \\label{mastereqnanoroddiss}\\ ] ] where @xmath34(\\rho)=2a\\rho a^\\dag - a^\\dag a\\rho-\\rho a^\\dag a\\label{decayoperator}.\\ ] ] the decay rate @xmath35 0.1 khz for a typical q - value of @xmath36 . at cryogenic temperatures ( @xmath37 mk ) the steady state of the nanoresonator is a thermal state corresponding to an occupation number @xmath38^{-1 } \\simeq$ ] 200 .      a cooper pair box ( cpb ) @xcite is a superconducting island connected via one or two josephson junctions ( jj ) to a superconducting reservoir .",
    "the dynamics of the cpb is governed by the charging energy @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 the total capacitance of the island , and the josephson energy @xmath42 , which determines the tunneling of cooper - pairs between the island and the reservoir .",
    "the dynamics is restricted to controlled cooper - pair tunneling if the superconducting gap @xmath43 is larger than the single electron charging energy , @xmath44 , and thermal processes are weak , @xmath45 . under these circumstances , it is possible , as we will show in [ appa ] , to define a two - level system ( qubit ) of the two lowest energy eigenstates of the island , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in this paper",
    "we consider the split cpb @xcite , as shown in figure [ setupfigure ] , where two ( ideally ) identical jjs , each with capacitance @xmath48 and josephson energy @xmath42 , couple the island to the reservoir . transitions between the two states are induced by a gate voltage microwave drive @xmath49 , applied via a gate capacitance @xmath50 together with a static bias @xmath51 .",
    "as we have shown in [ appa ] , the truncated circuit hamiltonian reads , in a frame rotating with the microwave drive @xmath52 , @xmath53 with the detuning @xmath54 and the drive strength @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath9 is written in the eigenbasis at the charge degeneracy point , defined by @xmath56 and @xmath57 . at this",
    "particular bias point the system is less sensitive to charge fluctuations @xcite , which would transform into fluctuations of the detuning @xmath58 and in principle could make the cooling procedure less efficient .     and capacitance @xmath48 , to the superconducting electrode . for a specific gate voltage",
    "@xmath59 the qubit eigenstates correspond to circulating currents in the circuit .",
    "currents are excited ( a ) by a magnetic flux @xmath60 applied through the loop or ( b ) by coupling the cpb to a large current - biased josephson junction .",
    "[ setupfigure ] ]    for a more realistic setup , one has to assume an asymmetry of a few percent ; we will discuss this issue in [ appa ] .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the loop - shape of the split cpb allows for circulating currents in the circuit .",
    "in fact , the energy eigenstates at the charge degeneracy point correspond to clockwise and anticlockwise loop currents @xcite . in the cpb circuit",
    "as described so far there is no asymmetry in the loop allowing the flow of a net current in either direction and therefore we have to add elements which break the symmetry .",
    "one possibility is to thread the circuit loop with an external magnetic flux @xmath61 , as shown in figure [ setupfigure](a ) .",
    "the magnetic field identifies a direction in the loop , and consequently one current direction is energetically favorable , giving rise to net currents in the circuit .",
    "the other option is to integrate a large current - biased josephson junction with josephson energy @xmath62 into the loop , as shown in figure [ setupfigure](b ) .",
    "as we show in [ appa ] , the bias current @xmath63 determines the phase across the large jj , and thus acts in a similar way as the magnetic flux @xmath61 . for the purpose of this paper , both ways to excite the loop currents are equivalent , and give rise to loop currents @xmath64 , @xmath65 with @xmath66 defined by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "it is obvious from the expression ( [ eq : iq ] ) that in the absence of magnetix flux or bias current , @xmath69 and the loop currents vanish .",
    "apart from the excitation of loop currents , the energy splitting is affected and thus the detuning @xmath58 is modified , @xmath70 as a last remark , we would like to point out that this derivation holds also for @xmath71 , where the qubit is even less sensitive to charge fluctuations @xcite . due to the anharmonicity of the energy spectrum ,",
    "it is possible to truncate the hilbert space to the two lowest energy eigenstates at the charge degeneracy point @xmath72 , and it can be shown that these states are eigenstates also of the truncated loop - current operator @xcite . however , more charge states will be involved in the qubit eigenstates , and thus the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath73 are modified .",
    "so far we have only described the coherent dynamics of the cpb .",
    "due to its coupling to the surrounding circuit leads and uncontrolled degrees of freedom within the circuit @xcite , the qubit is subject to dissipation .",
    "the dissipative dynamics of the qubit is determined by the depolarization time @xmath74 , which describes the relaxation to the ground state , and the dephasing time @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "these two processes are included phenomenologically @xcite into the qubit master equation , @xmath76(\\rho ) + \\frac{\\gamma_{\\rm d}}{4}{\\cal d}[\\sigma_z](\\rho)\\label{mastereqqdiss}\\ ] ] with @xmath77(\\rho)$ ] and @xmath78(\\rho)$ ] given by equation ( [ decayoperator ] ) . for an energy splitting @xmath79 ghz @xcite at a cryostat temperature @xmath80 of 15 mk ,",
    "the thermal occupation number of the excited state is negligibly small , @xmath81^{-1}\\simeq 0 $ ] , and therefore the heating term @xmath82(\\rho)$ ] can be neglected .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath83 can vary dramatically between different samples and working points @xcite .",
    "since the relaxation is crucial for the cooling procedure , we assume a typical value @xmath84 mhz @xcite . the derivations presented in section [ coolingsection ] ,",
    "[ appb ] and [ appc ] are valid for a finite @xmath83 , but for transparency we restrict the discussion in section [ discussion ] to the limit @xmath85 .",

    "-axis in plane with the cpb , such that the current flowing in the circuit along the @xmath86-direction will couple to the motion of the oscillator via the lorentz force , which acts in the @xmath87-direction as sketched in ( b).[fullcircuitmodel ] ]    as already mentioned earlier in this section , it is possible to excite circulating currents in the circuit , and we assume a construction where the currents are also driven through the resonator beam .",
    "a uniform magnetic field @xmath88 applied perpendicular to the long axis of the beam , as shown in figure [ fullcircuitmodel](a ) , together with the circulating qubit currents @xmath89 ( [ eq : iq ] ) creates a lorentz force @xmath90 which acts on the beam in the perpendicular direction @xmath87 @xcite as shown in figure [ fullcircuitmodel](b ) , @xmath91 since the sign of the lorentz force is qubit - state dependent through the qubit operator @xmath92 ( [ eq : ioperator ] ) , it can act as a cooling force on the displacement of the beam in the @xmath87-direction through the interaction term @xmath93 .",
    "writing the displacement of the beam as @xmath94 , with @xmath95 the amplitude of the zero - point motion , the interaction hamiltonian gets the form , @xmath96 with the coupling constant @xmath5 given by , @xmath97 note that this interaction term differs from the ubiquitous jaynes - cummings interaction @xcite , and thus the requirements for ground - state cooling will differ from for example the case of ion cooling @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the case of constant @xmath5 . assuming @xmath98 m , @xmath99 mt and @xmath100 na",
    ", we achieve a typical coupling constant @xmath101 khz . in principle",
    "it would also be possible to drive either the coupling magnetic field @xmath88 or the bias current @xmath63 , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "note that the coupling field @xmath88 does not create an additional flux in the circuit loop .",
    "however if we choose to use the setup in figure [ setupfigure](a ) , the applied flux @xmath102 in the @xmath87-direction would create a lorentz force in the perpendicular direction @xmath103 and could in principle lead to heating of the oscillation modes in this direction .",
    "however this coupling is very weak , since the magnetic field required to obtain @xmath61 is at least one order of magnitude lower than the coupling magnetic field @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , assuming a rectangular beam with @xmath104 , the oscillation frequency for the motion in the @xmath103-direction would be large compared to @xmath105 .",
    "in this section we derive an effective master equation for the relevant mode of the resonator motion , and the corresponding cooling equation . following the line of @xcite ,",
    "our main assumption is @xmath106 , which means that the qubit goes to equilibrium on a time scale which is much shorter than the time scale for the interaction between the qubit and the resonator .",
    "thus the state of the qubit is hardly affected by the interaction , and the qubit can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "the second important assumption is @xmath107 . due to the different time",
    "scales for the dissipation of the resonator via the qubit and via the coupling to its own environment , the two dissipation channels act separately .",
    "we define the small parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and thus treat the coupling between the qubit and the nanoresonator and also the intrinsic dissipation of the resonator as perturbations . for the perturbation expansion of the master equation",

    "the coupling to the cpb qubit has essentially two effects on the mechanical resonator , a negligibly small frequency shift and an additional dissipative channel , which can eventually exceed the natural dissipation due coupling to a phononic heat bath .",
    "if paramters are chosen in the right way , this can give rise to strong cooling .",
    "note however that the master equation for the resonator motion ( [ eq : reducme ] ) is correct only up to @xmath129 .",
    "from the master equation we derive the corresponding equation for the expectation value of the motional occupation number @xmath130 , @xmath131 the cooling equation ( [ coolingeq ] ) gives us information about the total cooling rate @xmath132 , @xmath133 and , provided that we are in the cooling regime ( @xmath134 ) , the final occupation number is given by @xmath135 equations ( [ wrate ] ) and [ nfeq ] are the main results of this paper .",
    "in the following , we will analyze the cooling rate ( [ wrate ] ) and the final occupation number ( [ nfeq ] ) , and define parameter regimes where cooling to the ground state is possible . in [ appc ]",
    "we derive an expression for the spectrum @xmath136 ( [ srapp ] ) which provides general expressions for the cooling rate @xmath132 and for @xmath137 in terms of the system parameters @xmath138 .",
    "we use the full expression to generate plots for @xmath137 and @xmath132 for a realistic set of parameters which were motivated in section [ setupsection ] .",
    "furthermore we give analytic expressions in the limit of weak qubit decay @xmath139 , where we introduce the qubit energy splitting in the rotating frame @xmath140 - see the single qubit hamiltonian ( [ htls ] ) .",
    "the cooling rate consists of two parts , as the coefficients @xmath141 ( [ apm ] ) show , where one part is due to the intrinsic decay @xmath4 of the resonator and the other one is due to the coupling @xmath5 to the dissipative qubit .",
    "the qubit serves as an additional bath for the resonator , with an effective decay rate determined by the coupling strength @xmath5 and the real part of the force spectrum @xmath136 ( [ forcespectrum ] ) .",
    "thus it is the presence of the lorentz force which makes it possible to cool the resonator motion below its thermal occupation . in the limit of weak qubit decay rate , @xmath139 ,",

    "[ fig:3omega ] , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    to lowest order in @xmath149 the spectrum in the vicinity of the peaks can be written , @xmath150 with the effective decay rate @xmath151 presented in ( [ gammaplus ] ) . since only the amplitude of the real part of the spectrum at the resonator frequency , @xmath152 , enters the cooling equation ( [ coolingeq ] ) , it is intuitively clear that in this regime cooling is significant only for @xmath153 .",
    "note that @xmath154 is responsible for cooling , whereas @xmath155 contributes to heating .",

    "this means that the energy provided to the qubit is less than its excitation energy , and thus energy is taken from the motion of the resonator to fully excite the qubit .",
    "consequently the resonator will be cooled .",

    "this motivates us to introduce the angle @xmath172 defined by @xmath173 we find that the highest cooling rate ( @xmath174 khz ) appears in a region around @xmath175 , which is confirmed analytically below .",
    "this means that @xmath73 has to be remarkably different from zero in order to get a high cooling rate , i.e. we have to drive the system strongly .",

    "a lower occupation number is achieved by increasing the quality factor of the resonator , or by decreasing the decay rate of the qubit . for @xmath223",
    "mhz ground state cooling can be obtained for @xmath224 , which corresponds to @xmath225 hz for @xmath143 mhz .",
    "this corresponds to the resolved sideband limit and the parameters we used so far .    remember that the results are presented in a frame where the resonator motion is shifted by a coherent shift @xmath119 ( [ eq : shiftalpha ] ) . in the original frame we would have to add the coherent part @xmath226 to @xmath137 .",

    "we draw the conclusion that our results are still valid for weak dephasing rate @xmath228 , whereas a large @xmath83 would change the conditions for ground - state cooling considerably .    as a last remark , we point out the similarities and differences of the cooling process discussed in this paper compared to the laser cooling of a trapped ion @xcite .",

    "the main difference between the two systems is the cooling force , which in this setup gives an interaction of the form @xmath230 , in contrast to the jaynes - cummings term @xmath231 which appears for ion cooling .",
    "this difference manifests itself in the dependence on @xmath58 and @xmath73 of the amplitude and the effective width of the spectral peaks , and consequently affects the optimal drive strength . as already mentioned earlier ,",
    "there are contributions to the cooling rate both from the intrinsic dissipation @xmath4 of the resonator and through the coupling to the two - level system , in contrast to ion cooling where only the latter is present since the motion of the ion is perfectly isolated .",
    "finally we should mention that whereas the laser both drives the internal degrees of freedom of the ion and its coupling to the motion , in this setup the qubit coupling to the motion is independent from the microwave signal which drives the qubit .",
    "in this paper we have derived the conditions for ground - state cooling of a nanoresonator beam which is integrated in a loop - shaped cooper - pair box ( cpb ) circuit .",
    "the cpb qubit acts as leaky two - level system through which the energy of the resonator motion dissipates .",
    "the cooling force in question , the qubit - state dependent lorentz force , acts on the beam due to circulating currents in the circuit in combination with an applied magnetic field .",
    "we have derived a general expression for the force spectrum , which determines the cooling rate and the final occupation number , and evaluated the result in the resolved sideband regime where the qubit decay @xmath1 is small compared to the resonator frequency @xmath105 .    in the resolved sideband regime ,",
    "the spectrum exhibits narrow peaks and cooling is optimized for the detuning @xmath232 . assuming this condition , we further investigated the cooling rate and the final occupation number as a function of the drive strength @xmath73 , and found that optimal cooling requires a strongly driven qubit ; the cooling rate is maximal for @xmath233 independently of the other parameters .",

    "thus given an initial occupation number of the mechanical mode , the possibility to reach the ground state is determined by the relation between the coupling strength @xmath5 and the decay rates @xmath1 and @xmath236 , requiring strong enough coupling in comparison to the decay rates .",
    "generally cooling requires @xmath237 , and in particular we could show that for @xmath163 , corresponding to @xmath238 mhz at @xmath37 mk , ground state cooling requires @xmath219 .",
    "let us also say a few words about the limiting cases . for @xmath239 ,",
    "the qubit is not driven and provides neither cooling nor heating .",
    "the cooling rate is given by the dissipation rate of the resonator , @xmath240 , and thus the mechanical mode stays at thermal occupation @xmath241 . for zero detuning , @xmath242",
    ", the qubit provides both cooling and heating of the resonator motion with equal amplitude , and the resonator is heated up to the final occupation number @xmath243 . the total cooling rate is still given by @xmath240 .    from the form of the parameter @xmath6",
    "it is clear that for a specific coupling strength @xmath5 , cooling is improved by a larger @xmath220 of the resonator , which basically reflects the fact that the resonator environment needs longer time to heat up the mechanical mode to its thermal state after it has been cooled .",
    "cooling is also improved by a weaker qubit decay @xmath1 , which is not very intuitive since the cooling procedure relies on the dissipation of the excited qubit state . however , from the point of view of the resonator , the decay of the qubit state shows up as an effective decay rate @xmath214 in for example the heating and cooling rates @xmath141 , and therefore the cooling efficiency decreases with larger @xmath1 .",

    "provided that the tilt is not too large , @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the critical current of the jj , the potential contains well - defined wells in which the phase is trapped .",
    "further we assume that @xmath254 , corresponding to a particle with infinite mass , in which case the phase stays at the minimum point @xmath66 determined by the bias current via the relation @xmath255 , and the large jj can be treated as a classical device without dynamics . here",
    "we also assumed that the currents through the large jj due to the cpb dynamics are small , which is justified if @xmath256 . the contribution from the large jj to the lagrangian",
