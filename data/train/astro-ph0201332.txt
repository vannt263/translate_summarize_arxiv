    "( 2001 ) analyzing the results of different investigators mentioned some discrepancies , and concluded that they were due to poorly determined @xmath3s and @xmath2s .",
    "all data , show , however , that some amount of low - mass groups of galaxies are located on the left side of the line @xmath7 .",
    "it has been generally assumed that the reason of such location of groups on the graph @xmath8 is the enhanced ( by one - two orders of magnitude ) x - ray emission of groups .",
    "it is widely assumed that the excess x - ray luminosity of the low - mass groups is explained by the `` mixed emission '' scenario ( dellantonio et al .",
    "1994 ) when the emission from the intragroup plasma may be contaminated by a superposition of diffuse x - ray sources corresponding to the hot interstellar medium of the member galaxies .",
    "however , the shift of groups to the left of the @xmath9 line may have another reason : underestimation of @xmath3s .",
    "it has been shown that hcgs and shcgs have a triaxial spheroid , `` cigar''-like shapes ( malykh & orlov 1986 , hickson et al .",
    "1984 , oleak et al . 1998 ) . in a series of papers tovmassian and collaborators ( tovmassian et al . 1999 ,",

    "2001 ) showed that @xmath3s of compact groups ( cgs ) , and of associated with them loose groups ( lgs ) which are also elongated and have the same orientation as corresponding cgs , are correlated with elongation of groups determined by @xmath10 ratio is the angular distance between the most widely separated galaxies in the group , and @xmath11 is the sum of the angular distances @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the most distant galaxies on either side of the line @xmath14 joining the most separated galaxies ( rood 1979 ) . ] .",
    "it means that members of cgs and lgs move along the elongation of corresponding group .",
    "it has been shown by tovmassian ( 2001a , 2001b ) and tovmassian & tiersch ( 2001 ) that out of three possibilities of such movement : flying out of galaxies from the center of the group in opposite directions , infalling from opposite directions , and regular rotation of member galaxies in elongated orbits around the gravitational center of each system , the latter possibility is the more realistic one .",
    "the rotation time is less than @xmath15 years , so cg+lg systems may well be virialized .",
    "the measured @xmath16s of such elongated groups depend on the orientation of the group .",
    "the highest values of @xmath16s are observed in those groups orientation of elongation of which is close to the line of sight .",
    "such groups generally have the highest @xmath10 ratio , though the chain - like groups oriented at small angles @xmath17 to the line of sight would also have relatively high @xmath16 .",
    "the measured @xmath16s of the majority of groups oriented at intermedient angles to the line of sight are smaller .",
    "the groups oriented close to the orthogonal to the line of sight have the smallest measured @xmath16s , i.e. their @xmath16s are highly underestimated .",
    "the latter groups are the most elongated and have the smallest @xmath10 ratio .",
    "hence , they would be located on the left part of the @xmath18 graph .",
    "we show in this paper that underestimation of @xmath16s of the seen edge - on elongated groups , indeed , creates the more shallow slope of the @xmath18 correlation .",
    "for this analysis we used the dataset of mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) which is the largest sample of the low - mass galaxy groups ( rasscals ) with detected x - ray emission , and the x - ray selected sample of hcgs ( ponman et al .",
    "we compared @xmath10 ratios of the groups most remote to the left from the line @xmath19 on the @xmath8 graph with those of the most remote to the right , or with those of the all other groups .",
    "the ratios @xmath10 for rasscals were determined on the corresponding maps presented in mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and those of for hcgs were taken from tovmassian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in the latter paper",
    "it is shown that the correlation between @xmath16s and @xmath10s does not depend on the number of group members .",
    "the following ten rasscals : srgb063 ( 0.35 ) , srgb075 ( 0.60 ) , srgb119 ( 0.44 ) , ssb085 ( 0.43 ) , nrgb045 ( 0.61 ) , ss2b153 ( 0.52 ) , nrgs317 ( 0.43 ) , srgb009 ( 0.27 ) , ss2b293 ( 0.41 ) , and ss2b313 ( 0.37 ) are the most remote to the left ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the groups ss2b056 ( 0.87 ) , nrgb004 ( 0.77 ) , nrgs027 ( 0.62 ) , nrgb0032 ( 0.56 ) , nrgs110 ( 0.50 ) , nrgs117 ( 0.75 ) , nrgb155 ( 0.96 ) , nrgs388 ( 0.45 ) , ss2b261 ( 0.46 ) , and srgs040 ( 0.87 ) are the most remote to the right .",
    "the corresponding @xmath10 values are listed in parentheses .",
    "the other 49 groups with measured x - ray emission are located along the @xmath20 line within the stripe with @xmath21 width .",
    "the mean @xmath10 of the groups at the left is equal to @xmath22 , and that of the groups at the right is @xmath23 .",
    "the same trend is observed in the case of hcgs .",
    "the mean value of @xmath10s of four groups located most remote to the left of the line @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "2 ) is equal to @xmath25 , while that of the rest 18 groups is equal to @xmath26 .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test rejected the hyphotesis that the compared distributions are of the same parent distribution in both considered cases .",
    "the significance level of rejection for the rasscals is @xmath27 , and for hcgs is @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig1 ]     [ fig2 ]    hence , the groups located to the left of the @xmath5 line on the @xmath8 graph have the smallest @xmath10 ratios .",
    "it indicates , that they are oriented close to the orthogonal to the line of sight . for this reason their measured radial velocity dispersions are smaller than the real values .",
    "location of such groups on the left side of the @xmath29 line creates an impression of the more shallow slope of the @xmath8 correlation .",
    "possible errors in @xmath10 values caused by missed members or chance interlopers would , apparently , increase the dispersion of the mean values , but would not introduce systematic errors in either direction .",
    "the highest @xmath16s of hcgs are @xmath30 km s@xmath31 .",
    "the highest @xmath16s of the groups studied by mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are of the same order .",
    "apparently , these are the groups observed end - on .",
    "their measured @xmath16s generally correspond to the real values .",
    "such groups would be located at the utmost right of the @xmath32 graph . with the increase of the angle @xmath17 the @xmath10 ratio and the corresponding @xmath16 of the group would decrease . at angles @xmath17 of about @xmath33",
    "the measured @xmath16s would be by about 400 km s@xmath31 smaller in comparison to the real values , and @xmath34 would be about 2.2 , which corresponds to that of the groups located at the utmost left on the @xmath35 graph .",
    "thus , _ not _ the x - ray luminosities of the low - mass groups are higher than it is expected by the @xmath5 law , but the @xmath16s of them are _",
    "underestimated_. rich clusters have much more symmetric round shape , and orientation may have negligible effect on the measured @xmath16 .",
    "the spread of clusters around the @xmath9 line is due to the natural dispersion of parameters .",
    "consideration of the @xmath10 ratios of the low - mass groups shows that groups located at the utmost left of the @xmath5 line on the @xmath36 graph have , on average , smaller @xmath10 values than those located at the utmost right .",
    "the elongation of groups with small @xmath10 ratios are oriented close to the orthogonal to the line of sight .",
    "the measured @xmath16s of these groups are , thus , underestimated , and are smaller than the real values .",
    "therefore , such groups are artificially shifted to the left on the @xmath8 graph .",
    "this creates an impression of an enhanced x - ray luminosity .",
    "if to take into account the reasonable amount of underestimation of @xmath16s ( of the order of 200 - 300 km s@xmath31 , which corresponds to angle @xmath17 of about @xmath37 ) , then the corresponding groups will be moved to the right , towards the line @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the low - mass groups _ obey _ the @xmath5 law for clusters of galaxies ( solinger & tucker 1972 , quintana & melnick 1982 ) .",
    "it means that there is no need to apply any mechanism of the enhancement of the x - ray luminosity of the low - mass groups , since in reality there is no any enhancement .",
    "compact groups are stable systems with members probably rotating around the gravitational center of the corresponding group ( tovmassian 2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "for the reason of regular movement in elongated orbits the velocities of member galaxies in the central region of a cg are high enough . therefore , the efficiency of interaction in such groups would be smaller than in the made numerical simulations when such regular movement has been neglected ( barnes 1985 , 1989 ; ishizawa 1986 ; mamon 1987 , 1990 ; zheng et al .",
    "the formation of the hot interstellar medium in member galaxies , widely assumed for explanation of the excess x - ray emission , may be very rare , and may not dominate the global x - ray emission .",
    "in fact , the claimed by many excess of the x - ray luminosity in the low - mass groups is due to a projection effect , and is , thus , a result of _ misinterpretation _ of the observational data .",
    "the finding of mahdavi & geller ( 2001 ) that clusters of galaxies and single elliptical galaxies form a continuous relation @xmath38 are consistent with the result presented in this paper .",
    "low - mass groups are not exotic objects and obey the same law ."
