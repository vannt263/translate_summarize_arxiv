    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are well known to be the birthplaces of stars . studies of various gmcs have not only revealed numerous protostellar objects of varying age , they have also detected localized maxima in dust column density that exhibit no signs of star formation and have been designated as starless cores ( e.g. , motte et al .",
    "1998 ; andr et al .",
    "1993 ; jrgensen et al .",
    "2007 ; di francesco et al . 2007 ) .",
    "some of these starless cores have been shown to be gravitationally bound and have been labeled as prestellar cores , as they are believed to be the progenitors of protostars ( e.g. , di francesco et al 2007 ; andr et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "further examination of prestellar cores can shed light on the earliest stages of star formation and , in particular , the processes that lead to the gravitational collapse of a core .",
    "the ophiuchus complex is particularly suitable for studying star formation as it is relatively close at only 120 pc ( loinard et al . 2008 ) and is an active star forming region ( loren et al . 1990 ) .",
    "previous studies have found multiple clumps inside the ophiuchus complex ( loren et al .",
    "1990 , johnstone et al .",
    "2004 ) . of particular interest is the oph a clump , the brightest of the clumps at mm wavelengths ( motte et al . 1998 ) , in which numerous starless cores and the prototypical class 0 object , vla 1623 ( andr et al . 1993 ) , are located .",
    "class 0 objects are deeply embedded protostars that have yet to accrete the majority of their final masses ( barsony 1994 ) .",
    "the oph a clump has previously been surveyed in millimeter wavelengths ( e.g. andr et al . 1993 ) and in numerous spectral lines including c@xmath5o ( j=1@xmath20 ) ( wilking & lada 1983 ) , @xmath3co ( j=1@xmath20 ) ( loren 1989 ) , cs ( j = 2@xmath21 ) ( liseau et al .",
    "1995 ) , and dco@xmath1 ( j=2@xmath21 , 3@xmath22 ) ( loren et al . 1990 ) .",
    "recently , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 j=1@xmath20 emission from the oph a clump was mapped with the bima array and the iram 30 m telescope ( di francesco et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter dam04 ) .",
    "dam04 discovered that the maxima of n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission are not coincident with the maxima of 1.3 mm continuum emission found by motte et al .",
    "this result was inconsistent with results from other low - mass starless cores surveyed by tafalla et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . within oph",
    "a , vla 1623 was found to have very little n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission , sm2 , a previously identified starless core ( andr et al . 1993 ) , was found to have weak n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission and a new core not identified in motte et al.s ( 1998 ) millimeter continuum survey as a continuum maximum , designated oph a - n6 , was found as an emission peak in n@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "dam04 suggested that the difference in n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission from these three cores was due to the cores being in different stages of development with n6 being the youngest and vla 1623 being the oldest .",
    "no intensity peak coincident with the location of the n6 core was found in either the 850 @xmath6 m or the 450 @xmath6 m surveys of oph a conducted with the submillimeter common - user bolometric array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( wilson et al .",
    "1999 ; johnstone et al .",

    "an interferometric submillimeter survey by bourke et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) , however , detected a localized intensity maximum at the location of the n6 core .",
    "no mid - infrared point source , down to 0.001 l@xmath7 , consistent with the presence of a protostar was found within the boundaries of the n6 core by the spitzer cores to disks ( c2d ) survey ( evans et al . 2003 , padgett et al .",
    "2008 ) , suggesting that the n6 core most likely does not contain a protostar .",
    "figure [ fig : dust ] shows the 850 @xmath6 m and 450 @xmath6 m emission from the oph a clump ( di francesco et al . 2008 ) , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission from the n6 core ( dam04 ) , the location of the submillimeter intensity maximum found by bourke et al .",

    "dam04 found that the n@xmath0h@xmath1  line widths in n6 were only slightly larger than expected from thermal motions alone and that the n6 core is , to first order , in gravitational virial equilibrium .",
    "thus , all evidence suggests that the n6 core is a prestellar core and that it is no longer strongly interacting with the turbulent flows of its surroundings .",
    "it has been suggested that turbulent motions could be reduced in dense cores if the cores become smaller than the cut - off wavelength for magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves in the region ( e.g. , mckee et al .",
    "1993 ; nakano 1998 ; myers 1998 ) .",
    "since turbulent gas flows and magnetic support are likely important parts of a core s support against gravitational collapse ( caselli et al . 2002 ; myers 1999 ; mckee 1989 ) , the n6 core may be on the verge of gravitational collapse .",
    "this makes the n6 core a valuable object for further study into the removal of support against gravitational collapse .    in section [ obs ]",

    "all observations , except those of the h@xmath3co@xmath1 j=4@xmath23 transition , were made on a 5 x 5 grid with 10  spacing centered on the position of maximum n@xmath0h@xmath1 j=1@xmath20 integrated intensity found by dam04 , i.e. [ ra , decl . ] = [ @xmath8 , -@xmath9 ( j2000 ) , which we define as our standard grid .",

    "observations of nh@xmath4 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion line emission , at a single pointing centered on the n@xmath0h@xmath1 maximum position , were obtained using the 100 m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "a total of ten minutes was spent on source over 2006 april 9 - 10 while the source was at @xmath11 elevation and @xmath12 k. the observations were done in frequency - switched mode using the gbt k - band ( upper ) receiver as the front end and the gbt spectrometer as the backend .",

    "models of the dense interiors of starless cores show that the dust and gas temperatures should be relatively similar ( e.g. hollenbach et al .",
    "1991 ; galli et al .",
    "a @xmath46 of 0.9 is comparable to values found in other star - forming regions ( e.g. beuther et al .",
    "2004 ; hogerheijde & sandell 2000 ; goldsmith et al .",

    "( 1993 ) .    assuming that @xmath46 is constant over the n6 core , we were then able to derive dust temperatures for all points on our standard grid from the ratio of the submillimeter fluxes . figure [ fig : temp ] shows our derived dust temperature profile for the n6 core . with a @xmath46 of 0.9",
    ", we find that the central dust temperature is 20.2 k and that the average dust temperature is 15.4 k. the dust temperature at the location of the n@xmath0d@xmath1 integrated intensity peak is 18.8 k.    the scuba legacy catalogues also contain error maps for the submillimeter data .",
    "we recalculated two average dust temperatures for the n6 core after adding the 850 @xmath6 m errors to the 850 @xmath6 m data and subtracting the 450 @xmath6 m errors from the 450 @xmath6 m data and vice versa . by averaging the absolute differences between these new average dust temperatures and our original average dust temperature",
    ", we estimate that our continuum - derived dust temperatures are accurate to 4.5 k. since the peak dust temperature of the n6 core is 4.8 k higher than the average dust temperature of the core , we believe that the dust temperature peak at the central location of the n6 core is significant , albeit marginally . it is also unlikely that noise would produce a coherent dust temperature peak that spans multiple pixels , as seen in figure [ fig : temp ] . a multi - wavelength analysis with high quality fluxes from at least four bands ( and 350 microns in particular ) should improve significantly the dust temperature characterization ( see schnee et al .",
    "we also consider our average dust temperature of 15.4 k to be in agreement with the average n@xmath0h@xmath1 excitation temperature derived by dam04 ( 17.4 k ) , supporting their suggestion that the n@xmath0h@xmath1 1@xmath20 line is thermalized .    di francesco et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested that the absolute fluxes in the 850 @xmath6 m and 450 @xmath6 m maps have uncertainties of 20% and 50% respectively .",
    "these errors are not expected to fluctuate significantly over small spatial scales , however .",
    "therefore , these errors would only affect our determination of @xmath46 and/or the absolute temperature scale , but would not affect the derived temperature structure of the n6 core , since the relative temperature structure is independent of the choice of @xmath46 .",
    "the observed changes in the ratio of the submillimeter fluxes can be explained as due to either a temperature gradient , with a constant value of @xmath46 over the entire core , as assumed above , or due to a gradient in @xmath46 , with a constant temperature everywhere in the core .",
    "if the entire n6 core were to be at a temperature of 20.1 k , @xmath46 would have to range from 0.9 at the center of the core to 0.23 at the periphery .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. goldsmith et al . 1997 ) have found that @xmath46 decreases with increasing density and increasing grain size , the opposite of what would be needed in the n6 core for the core to be at a constant temperature . thus , we believe that the submillimeter continuum data are indicative of a temperature gradient in n6 rather than a gradient in @xmath46 .      due to the blending of the n@xmath0d@xmath1 hyperfine components , we adopted the method given by caselli et al .",

    "this method assumes that the n@xmath0d@xmath1 emission is optically thin and in lte .",
    "since the n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission from the n6 core is only marginally optically thick ( dam04 ) , we believe the assumption that the n@xmath0d@xmath1 emission is optically thin is reasonable .",
    "we used the dust temperatures calculated in section [ temp ] , to account for the decrease in temperature away from the n@xmath0h@xmath1 peak , and rejected any spectra that did not have a s / n greater than three .",

    "we calculated new column densities using excitation temperatures 4.5 k greater than and less than our derived temperatures and integrated intensities 0.06 k km s@xmath13 greater than and less than our observed values . from this , we estimate the uncertainty in our column densities to be @xmath50 @xmath48 .",
    "dam04 found that the line widths for n@xmath0h@xmath1 in the n6 core were only slightly larger than the theoretical , thermal line widths .",
    "we have calculated the thermal line widths for the molecular transitions that we have observed using the gas temperature derived from the nh@xmath4 observations , 20.1 k , for all of the transitions observed with the jcmt and the following equation from myers et al .",
    "( 1991 ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the average thermal line width , @xmath53 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath54 is the gas temperature , and @xmath55 is the molecular mass of the species . since we are not concerned with pixel - to - pixel variations in line width for these calculations , we have chosen to use the 20.1k gas temperature derived from the nh@xmath4 data .",
    "we also calculated the average non - thermal component of the line width for each transition by subtracting the thermal line width from the average observed line width in quadrature . for each transition , the average observed line width was calculated from the innermost 9 grid points . these results are summarized in table [ tab : linewidth ] .",
    "at the high densities and low temperatures present at the center of starless cores , various molecules can freeze out onto dust grains and the abundances of these molecules , and their related ions , in the gas phase can become depleted ( e.g. , lger 1983 ; bergin & tafalla 2007 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that the varying properties of molecules , such as their binding energies to dust grains and their reactivity with co , will cause different molecules to deplete or form at different depths inside a core ( di francesco et al .",

    "the localized emission peaks seen in the n@xmath0h@xmath1 and n@xmath0d@xmath1 integrated intensity maps , shown in figure [ fig : allmol ] , suggest that these molecules are present near the center of the core .",
    "furthermore , the locations of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 and n@xmath0d@xmath1 emission peaks seem to suggest that the central part of the n6 core is a high - density ridge that stretches between [ 0,0 ] and [ -10,10 ] . this is supported by the position of a small submillimeter continuum peak interferometrically detected by bourke et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) at [ 0,5 ] .",
    "a comparison of figure [ fig : temp ] to figure [ fig : allmol ] shows that the strongest n@xmath0d@xmath1 emission occurs at a location with a colder dust temperature than the location of the peak n@xmath0h@xmath1 intensity .",
    "this is expected since colder temperatures tend to increase the chemical abundance of deuterated species in cores ( vastel et al .",
    "the colder temperature of the n@xmath0d@xmath1 maximum location would also explain why this was the location of dam04 s minimum observed , thermally dominated n@xmath0h@xmath1 line widths .",
    "while the d / h ratio of 0.02 observed is smaller than those seen in the most heavily deuterated cores ( e.g. , 0.1 to 0.5 ; crapsi et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is consistent with the increased deuterium abundance seen in other starless cores ( 0.01 to 0.44 ; see ceccarelli et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) and is still a high level of fractionation .",
    "figure [ fig : allmol ] shows how the cs integrated intensity is smaller at the center of the n6 core than at its edges .",
    "this drop in cs integrated intensity suggests that the cs column density must also be significantly reduced at the center . as cs has been observed to deplete readily in other cold , dense cores ( e.g. , bergin et al .",
    "2001 ; lai et al .",
    "2003 ; tafalla et al .",
    "2006 ) , we suggest that cs is freezing out onto dust grains in the center of n6 .",
    "thus , cs most likely only exists in the gas phase in an outer shell of material .",
    "figure [ fig : allmol ] shows also that dco@xmath1 and h@xmath3co@xmath1 have a steady decreasing brightness gradient from the northwest edge to the center of our grid that is suggestive of a decline in the column densities of these molecules towards the center of n6 .",
    "depletion of these molecules in cold , dense environments is also well known and has been observed in the l1498 and l1517b cores ( e.g. , tafalla et al .",
    "the decrease in the integrated intensity of the cs lines at the center of the n6 core is more pronounced than in the dco@xmath1 or h@xmath3co@xmath1 lines and thus , we suggest that cs is more heavily depleted towards the center and occurs in a shell - like structure further from the center than the h@xmath3co@xmath1 and dco@xmath1 .",
    "since co is known to destroy h@xmath0d@xmath1 , the depletion of co would be expected to lead to an increase in the rate of formation of deuterated species such as dco@xmath1 ( bergin & tafalla 2007 and references therein ) and this may explain the differences in the dco@xmath1 and h@xmath3co@xmath1 morphologies . since hco@xmath1 is chemically similar to dco@xmath1 and h@xmath3co@xmath1 we expect that the hco@xmath1 is depleting at a similar location to where the dco@xmath1 and h@xmath3co@xmath1 are depleting .",
    "figure [ fig : structure ] shows a cut - away diagram of the chemical shell structure that we suggest exists in the n6 core . for molecules where",
    "multiple transitions were observed , the combined average line width for these transitions is shown .      given the chemical structure of the n6 core described in section [ structure ] , the turbulent component of the line widths , ( see section [ nontherm ] and table [ tab : linewidth ] ) , appears to increase with increasing distance from the center of the core .",
    "the only exception to this trend is that there is no significant difference in line width between the h@xmath3co@xmath1 and cs .",
    "the cs and h@xmath3co@xmath1 line widths seem to be consistent with the line widths of the general oph a medium ( dam04 ) , which would explain why no further increase in line width is seen between cs and h@xmath3co@xmath1 .",
    "the slight increase in temperature towards the outer layers of the n6 core is insufficient to explain the significant increase in line width observed , as a temperature in excess of 200 k would be needed for the cs line widths to be entirely due to thermal broadening .",
    "the difference in line width between the n@xmath0d@xmath1 and the n@xmath0h@xmath1 may be due to the difference in beam sizes used in observing these molecular transitions .",
    "the larger 20  beam used to observe the n@xmath0d@xmath1 would have detected emission coming from more outlying , and thus more turbulent , gas than the approximately 10  x 6  beam used to observe the n@xmath0h@xmath1 would have .",
    "this more turbulent gas would have broadened the n@xmath0d@xmath1 lines slightly .",
    "this trend is supported by andr et al.s ( 2007 ) finding of a 0.37 km s@xmath13 n@xmath0h@xmath1 average line width in the n6 core with a 26  beam .",
    "we also see a barely significant increase of 0.08 km s@xmath13 in average line width between the dco@xmath1 5@xmath24 transition , observed with a 14  beam , and the dco@xmath1 3@xmath22 transition , observed with a 20  beam .",
    "we see no significant difference between the line widths of the two observed transitions of cs and h@xmath3co@xmath1 , suggesting , again , that the cs and h@xmath3co@xmath1 probe regions with the same level of turbulent motion as the general oph a medium .",
    "these results suggest that turbulent motions have been suppressed in the center of the n6 core and that the central part of the n6 core is no longer strongly interacting with the general , turbulent oph a material .",
    "a possible mechanism for this dissipation of turbulent motion has been proposed by various authors ( e.g. , mckee et al .",
    "1993 ; nakano 1998 ; myers 1998 ) who suggest that turbulent motions in dense cores could be reduced if the cores become smaller than the cut - off wavelength for mhd waves in the region . myers ( 1998 ) suggested that these regions cut off from mhd waves could be on the order of 5000 au ( @xmath56 40 at the distance of the n6 core ) and dam04 described how the n6 core seems to fit well the description of a kernel as described by myers ( 1998 ) .",
    "the suppression of turbulent motions and mhd waves in the n6 core also has a significant impact on the evolutionary state of the core , as it is believed that turbulence and magnetic fields are significant components of a core s support against gravitational collapse .",
    "the lack of such support in the n6 core could make the core prone to gravitational collapse .      as first mentioned in section [ morph",
    "] , many of the hco@xmath1 3@xmath22 spectra are double peaked and asymmetric , with the gap between the peaks occurring at the same frequency as the optically thin dco@xmath1 3@xmath22 line .",
    "if this dual peak structure were due to a second gas cloud in the line - of - sight , we would expect that the dco@xmath1 3@xmath22 spectra would appear at the same velocity as one of the two peaks in the hco@xmath1 spectra ( e.g. , gregersen et al . 1997 ; myers et al .",
    "since the dco@xmath1 3@xmath22 spectral line appears between the two peaks in the hco@xmath1 spectra for all asymmetric hco@xmath1 spectra , this dual - peak structure is most likely due to self - absorption , rather than a second line - of - sight cloud .",
    "the rest frequencies of the hco@xmath1 3@xmath22 transition and dco@xmath1 3@xmath22 transition given by the jcmt and lamda databases are consistent and thus , we do not believe that this alignment is a coincidental artifact due to uncertainty in the rest frequencies of these lines .",
    "gregersen et al ( 1997 ) showed that the type of blue asymmetry predominately seen in the hco@xmath1 3@xmath22 spectra is indicative of infall motion .",
    "this asymmetry is most likely not due to random motions in the core , as this would produce a blue excess value close to zero .",
    "rotation , alone , would also produce a blue excess value close to zero ( pavlyuchenkov et al .",
    "the prevalence of blue asymmetry suggests that the n6 core is collapsing .",
    "models of well - shielded , starless , dense cores have shown that the central kinetic temperature will be low ( @xmath57 k ) and that temperature increases with increasing radius due to heating by an external radiation field ( e.g. , hollenbach et al .",
    "after the onset of gravitational collapse , the central region should be warmed by the release of gravitational potential energy and the central temperature will increase ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "this is the behavior seen in our dust continuum temperature map ( figure [ fig : temp ] ) in which the central region ( 20.2 k ) is slightly warmer than the surrounding dust envelope ( 15.4 k ) and is consistent with the onset of collapse of the core . as the temperature increase observed in the n6 core",
    "is still relatively small , it has probably only recently started to collapse .",
    "gas at temperatures above 20.2 k , however , may exist in a region smaller than the size of our grid spacing .",
    "such a collapse is also consistent with the lack of turbulent support mentioned in section [ turbulence ] .",
    "the lack of cs emission from the center of n6 is also consistent with the core being at an early stage of collapse , since cs is predicted to evaporate off dust grains only during the later stages of gravitational collapse ( e.g. , charnley 1997 ) .",
    "the spitzer c2d survey of the oph a region did not detect any infrared source consistent with a young stellar object ( yso ) within the boundaries of the n6 core , which further suggests that the n6 core has yet to evolve to the class 0 protostar stage .",
    "it should be noted that the blue asymmetry in the hco@xmath1 spectra is not strongly peaked around the central parts of the n6 core but rather , is detected at multiple locations toward the periphery of the core as well as at the central locations of the core .",
    "furthermore , since hco@xmath1 is most likely depleted in the innermost parts of the n6 core , as suggested by the depletion of h@xmath3co@xmath1 and dco@xmath1 , this infall signature is most likely only coming from the mid - to - outer layers of the cloud .",
    "our tentative detection of a temperature increase at the center of the core , however , suggests that this infall motion does extend to the core s center .",
    "these points suggest that the n6 core is not undergoing an inside - out collapse , as predicted by the shu ( 1977 ) model , but rather , is undergoing a global collapse along the lines of the larson ( 1969 ) and penston ( 1969 ) models .",
    "indeed various numerical hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , foster & chevalier 1993 ; hennebelle et al .",
    "2003 ) have shown that the larson - penston model provides the better approximation at early times of the collapse .",
    "we also can not discount the possibility that we are just observing a global compression or contraction of the n6 core and not a gravitationally induced collapse .",
    "our observations suggest that the oph a - n6 core is an extremely young prestellar core , which has been recently cut off from mhd support and begun to collapse .",
    "evidence to support this claim comes from :    1 .   _ the chemical structure of n6 _ - the n@xmath0d@xmath1 map shows a well - defined core centered at [ -10,10 ] , which is slightly offset from the peak of the n@xmath0h@xmath1  emission at [ 0,0 ] ( dam04 ) .",
    "the n@xmath0d@xmath1 emission also appears to be slightly more compact than the n@xmath0h@xmath1  emission , which shows a small ridge extending approximately 10@xmath58 to the northwest .",
    "the dco@xmath1 and h@xmath3co@xmath1 maps , however , show little sign of a centrally concentrated core - like structure .",
    "rather , they mimic the dust continuum gradient ( di francesco et al .",
    "2008 ) suggesting that these two molecules are depleted at the center of the n6 core .",
    "the cs maps show a ring of emission around the central location of n6 , also indicating significant depletion of cs at the center . as a result ,",
    "we believe that the n6 core is composed of shells of different chemical composition due to the different densities at which each chemical species freezes out onto dust grains . in this model , the undepleted species n@xmath0d@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1  trace the cold , high - density interior of n6 , dco@xmath1 and h@xmath3co@xmath1 trace a region which lies further from the center , and cs traces the outermost edges of the core . this type of molecular freeze out is a common feature in other dense starless cores ( e.g. tafalla et al . 2006 ) .",
    "2 .   _ the decreased line widths in the center of n6 _ - the average n@xmath0d@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1  line widths in the central region of the core are @xmath59 0.3 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the dco@xmath1 and cs line widths , however , are 0.44 km s@xmath13 and 0.55 km s@xmath13 respectively . given our proposed chemical structure for n6 , this is consistent with the line widths increasing with increasing distance from the center .",
    "a calculation of the non - thermal component required to match the observed line widths suggests that the non - thermal contribution to the line widths is greater at the edge of n6 than in the core center .",
    "this supports the claim that the center of n6 has been cut off from turbulent support .",
    "3 .   _ observed infall motion _ - the hco@xmath1 spectra in n6 were found to exhibit distinct blue asymmetries across the n6 core .",
    "the average asymmetry parameter for the hco@xmath1 spectra ( mardones et al .",
    "1997 ) was found to be -0.71 which suggests that the mid - to - outer layers of the n6 core , which are probed by the optically thick hco@xmath1 spectra , are falling towards the center of the core .",
    "we also tentatively detected a slight increase in temperature towards the center of the n6 core , which suggests that this infall motion extends to the center of the core if this temperature increase is due to the release of gravitational potential energy .",
    "if the temperature is highest in the center and lower at the edges , the gradient of non - thermal motions is steeper than the line widths above suggest .",
    "while our data have revealed a shell - like structure for the n6 core , this analysis is still restricted by the relatively low spatial resolution of the jcmt at these frequencies .",
    "interferometric observations of n6 of these transitions would help constrain the radius at which each species begins to deplete and may confirm our proposed chemical structure .",
    "a detailed high - resolution examination of the kinematic structure of the n6 core is currently being conducted by bourke et al .",

    "an investigation into the ionization level of the n6 core ( e.g. see hezareh et al . 2009 , in preparation ; plume et al .",
    "1998 ) may also provide further evidence for whether mhd waves are not propagating into the interior of the core and hence , whether the cut - off from mhd waves is the cause of the decreased non - thermal support in the center of oph a - n6 .",
