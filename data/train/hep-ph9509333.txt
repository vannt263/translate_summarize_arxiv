    "at high temperature @xmath2 and low momenta @xmath3 the effective degrees of freedom in any field theory are collective modes , bosonic  plasmons \" @xcite and fermionic `` plasminos '' @xcite .",
    "even if the fundamental field theoretical degrees of freedom were massless , the collective modes possess a finite  thermal \" mass which is generated dynamically by the interactions among the fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "the thermal masses regulate ( some of ) the severe infrared divergences which the massless theory would otherwise develop at finite temperature due to the singularity of the bose distribution at zero momentum @xcite .",
    "the strong rise of the bose distribution at small momenta causes , for example , the transport properties ( viscosity , heat conduction ) of a hot plasma of massless fields to be dominated by the interaction between low - momentum collective modes @xcite .",
    "the determination of their dispersion relation and their collisional width is therefore a necessary prerequisite for any microscopic calculation of the transport coefficients , for example using the kubo formulae @xcite .",
    "it is known that a consistent determination of the plasmon dispersion relation and width in a massless field theory requires the resummation of certain loop contributions to the propagator , the so - called  hard thermal loops \" ( htl ) @xcite . in massless gauge theories , this resummation becomes non - trivial beyond leading order , due to the complicated analytical structure of the htls ( i.e. their momentum dependence and logarithmic branch cuts from landau damping @xcite ) . in massless",
    "scalar @xmath4 theory , the resummation is much easier @xcite , since the leading htl ( the tadpole diagram ) is just a momentum - independent real constant , and it can therefore be relatively easily be carried beyond leading order @xcite .",
    "still , when we started this work , no calculation of the collisional _ width _ of finite momentum plasmons existed . since the latter is needed , however , for the calculation of transport coefficients from the kubo formulae ( previous calculations @xcite used , for lack of better knowledge but without justification , the zero momentum limit of the plasmon width ) , we present in this paper a calculation of the resummed scalar field propagator in @xmath0 theory at the 2-loop level , including real _ and _ imaginary parts in 4-dimensional momentum space . while this work was in progress",

    "for a hot scalar field , we consider the following lagrangian with @xmath5 : @xmath6 at the tree level it describes massless scalar fields with a quartic self interaction .",
    "the induced thermal mass resulting from the single htl ( tadpole ) is of order @xmath1 and reads @xcite @xmath7 the effects from this thermal mass can be resummed by defining an effective lagrangian through @xmath8 and treating the last term as an additional interaction .",
    "this effective lagrangian defines an effective propagator with thermal mass @xmath9 @xmath10 where in the imaginary time formalism @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "it represents the infinite sum of iterated htls .",
    "since @xmath9 leads to a qualitative modification of the resummed effective propagator for soft momenta , @xmath14 , its inclusion via resummation is necessary to avoid infrared divergences at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "vertex corrections from htls are down by a factor @xmath1 relative to the bare vertex @xmath15 and do nt qualitatively change the latter . in a perturbative expansion of @xmath4 theory we can thus keep using the bare vertex @xcite .",
    "one can now recalculate the 1-loop self - energy using this resummed effective propagator .",

    "therefore the essential criterium for the validity of the resummation procedure is the smallness of the coupling constant and not that of @xmath158 or @xmath154 .",
    "this argument is also supported by a numerical investigation of the sum rule eq .",
    "( [ sumrule ] ) . in table  [ t1 ] we give values for the integral up to the 3-particle threshold , @xmath159 for different values of @xmath160 ( or of the coupling constant @xmath21 ) at @xmath161 and for different values of @xmath154 at fixed @xmath162 . from the given numbers we see that in all cases the sum rule is nearly exhausted by the collective plasmon mode , and that the 3-body decay contribution at @xmath163 is negligible . for large coupling constant ( @xmath164 ) , where the resummation of hard thermal loops is no longer expected to be a good approximation , we begin to see appreciable violations of the sum rule . on the other hand , for @xmath165 ,",
    "the sum rule is very well satisfied even for very large momenta , @xmath166 . as a consequence , the shape of the spectral function ( in particular the interplay of the @xmath167-dependence of its width and height at the plasmon pole shown in figs .",
    "[ f7 ] and [ f8 ] ) is completely controlled by this sum rule .",
    "in this paper we studied the analytical structure of the full propagator and the properties of the plasmon in hot @xmath4 theory at 2-loop order , using the hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummation scheme .",
    "since in @xmath4 theory the one - loop self - energy is completely real , damping of the plasmon occurs only at the 2-loop level .",
    "its physical origin is landau damping by scattering with thermal scalar field quanta .",
    "this results in a cut of the full propagator along the entire real frequency axis .",
    "however , for small coupling constant @xmath1 the spectral function which is given by the discontinuity across this cut shows a strong and rather sharp plasmon peak located at the position expected from the 1-htl - resummation .",
    "its width @xmath168 is approximately given by @xmath169 for plasmons at rest in the heat bath , and this width decreases even further if the plasmon is moving relative to the heat bath . for very fast plasmons",
    "the width goes to zero while the height of the plasmon peak approaches to a constant : the plasmon behaves again like a non - interacting free particle , i.e. it looses the features of a collective mode . within the range of validity of our resummation scheme , which is defined by the smallness of the coupling constant @xmath170",
    "compared to 1 , the plasmon remains a well - defined , weakly - damped quasiparticle excitation for all values of the temperature .",
    "the sum rule eq .",
    "( [ sumrule ] ) for the spectral density is very well satisfied by the 2-loop result even for momenta much larger than @xmath2 , and it is essentially saturated by the plasmon peak .",
