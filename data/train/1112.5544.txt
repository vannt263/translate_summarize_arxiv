    "the experimental discovery of graphene and other free - standing two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals @xcite has opened the path for the synthesis of a whole class of layered materials with novel physical properties and with a great potential for technological applications @xcite .",
    "the most prominent member , graphene  a monoatomic layer of crystalline c with hexagonal structure  is a metallic conductor .",
    "in addition to an unusual electronic spectrum , this material shows extraordinary mechanical strength @xcite and thermal properties @xcite .    on the other hand 2d hexagonal boron - nitride ( h - bn )",
    "is an insulator @xcite ( 3d h - bn has a direct band gap in the ultraviolet region @xcite ) . while graphene is a purely covalent crystal , 2d h - bn , built from iii - v elements , has partially covalent and ionic bonds .",
    "the ionic character is a consequence of the charge transfer of @xmath1 electrons from b to n @xcite . since the crystal structure of 2d h - bn is non - centrosymmetric ( point group symmetry @xmath2 )",
    ", the two sublattices ( b@xmath3 and n@xmath4 ) exhibit an electromechanical coupling .",
    "hence 2d h - bn is the structurally most simple crystal which , according to theoretical predictions @xcite , should be piezoelectric .",
    "nanoscale thin sheets of graphene , 2d h - bn and related layered materials @xcite are of great importance for applications as electronic devices and nanoelectromechanical systems .",
    "the synthesis and characterization of multilayers and the study of their physical and chemical properties is a challenge of current solid - state physics and materials science . in particular , the change of properties with the number of layers and the evolution of the layer system to the corresponding bulk material are of foremost importance .",
    "most remarkable is for instance the change in electronic structure from graphene , a zero - gap semiconductor , to graphite , a semimetal with band overlap @xcite .",
    "these theoretical results are directly related to the interpretation of electronic transport experiments @xcite .",
    "the change in the electronic bands is reflected in the double resonance raman spectrum that clearly evolves with the number of layers @xcite . beside the electronic structure ,",
    "the elastic properties depend on the number of layers .",
    "atomic force microscopy experiments ( afm ) on various thin - sheet materials demonstrate that the nanoscale friction decreases with increasing number of layers @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the trend arises from the thinner sheets increased susceptibility to out - of - plane elastic deformations .    since physical properties vary with the number of layers , it is important to study separately the lattice dynamics of modes where the atomic planes move as rigid units .",
    "since this motion is governed by the weak interlayer forces , the corresponding frequencies are low ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) in comparison with the high - frequency optical modes ( @xmath7 @xmath6 ) which are due to covalent intralayer forces . in graphite these low - frequency modes",
    "have been discovered half a century ago by inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "one distinguishes modes where the planes move parallel to the hexagonal axis ( we will call these modes compression modes ) , and modes where the planes move perpendicular to this axis ( shear modes ) . later on the complete phonon dispersions associated with rigid - plane motion",
    "have been measured by neutron scattering @xcite . the rigid - plane ( -layer ) shear mode is optically active and has been measured by raman scattering in graphite @xcite and in 3d h - bn @xcite . due to the weakness of the interlayer forces , the rigid - layer shear frequency in graphite @xcite and in h - bn",
    "@xcite increases strongly with applied pressure .",
    "the measurement of rigid - layer modes in few - layer systems has been an outstanding problem .",
    "neutron scattering is not an adequate technique since the samples are too small .",
    "most recently , the interlayer shear modes in few - layer graphene systems have been uncovered by raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the increase of the resonance frequency with increasing layer number provides a unique signature for few - layer graphene systems and for multilayers in general .    in the present paper we report on theoretical studies of low - frequency rigid - layer shear modes and compression modes in graphene- and boron - nitride multilayers . while the high - frequency optical mode spectra of graphene- and boron - nitride multilayers are very different due to the efficiency of coulomb forces in the latter @xcite , the low - frequency optical mode spectra in both systems turn out to be very similar .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . first ( sect .",
    "ii ) we present the main theoretical concepts which are used to treat by analytical means the lattice dynamics of multilayer systems . within a same formalism we consider graphene multilayers and h - bn multilayers .",
    "the phonon dispersion relations of the corresponding rigid - layer motions ( compression and shear modes ) are calculated in sect .",
    "the dependence of the frequency spectra on the number of layers @xmath0 is presented in the form of fan diagrams .",
    "next ( sect .",
    "iv ) we compare the theoretical results with experiment",
    ". then we derive relations between the phonon frequencies of the rigid layer systems and the dispersions of the corresponding bulk materials .",
    "we derive master curves which allow to connect the fan diagram frequencies for any given @xmath0 . in sect .  v we calculate static and dynamic thermal displacement correlation functions .",
    "the temperature dependence of displacement correlations of surface layers is calculated , the dependence on the layer number @xmath0 is investigated . concluding remarks ( sect .",
    "vi ) close the paper .",
    "in previous work we have studied by analytical methods the phonon dispersion relations for graphene multilayers ( gml ) @xcite and h - bn multilayers ( bnml ) @xcite . here",
    "we briefly recall the main concepts .",
