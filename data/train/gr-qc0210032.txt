    "along with a new generation of gravitational wave detectors around the world @xcite , detection algorithms for a variety of sources are nearing completion .",
    "if the signals from these sources are detected , physicists stand to harvest unprecedented quantities of observational information concerning the nature of gravitation and the cosmos as a whole",
    ". the fruit of this harvest will be the outputs of detection algorithms . in this paper",
    "we introduce an algorithm designed for nearly optimal detection of a class of gravitational wave stochastic backgrounds .",
    "the non - gaussian nature of this class of backgrounds causes the algorithm presented here to differ from the well studied cross - correlation based algorithms which are nearly optimal for gaussian backgrounds .",
    "consider a large collection of similar gravitational wave sources .",
    "if we can not resolve the individual signals produced by these sources and know only their statistical properties , the signals form a stochastic background .",
    "a wide variety of candidate sources of gravitational wave stochastic backgrounds have been studied ( for an excellent general review see ref .",
    "these include high redshift supernovae @xcite , the first stars or so - called population iii objects @xcite , rapidly rotating young neutron stars @xcite , early universe phase transitions and cosmic strings @xcite , inflation @xcite , and high redshift compact binaries @xcite .",
    "detecting a gravitational wave stochastic background produced by any one of these candidate sources could provide information on a variety of topics ranging from the evolution of the star formation rate @xcite to the numbers and sizes of posited extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "because of this , stochastic backgrounds have long been thought to be among the most interesting possible types of gravitational radiation .      in order to develop detection methods",
    ", it is traditionally assumed that the individual events making up a background are uncorrelated and sufficiently frequent for the background to be gaussian .",
    "that is , it is assumed that the conditions for applicability of the central limit theorem are satisfied .    unlike electromagnetic waves , gravitational waves can not be screened from a detector . using a single gravitational wave detector ,",
    "there is no practical way to distinguish between detector noise and a stochastic background of gravitational waves . as a consequence",
    "the sensitivity of a single detector to gravitational backgrounds is severely limited . by comparing the outputs of multiple detectors ,",
    "sensitivity levels can be enhanced .",
    "michelson @xcite was the first to give a detailed description of such a detection method for a gaussian stochastic background of gravitational waves in the presence of gaussian detector noise .",
    "his detection strategy and its later refinements @xcite are often referred to as the cross - correlation method . recently",
    "the cross - correlation method has been modified to treat more realistic detectors which themselves have sources of non - gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "we now briefly review the cross - correlation method .",
    "consider two gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the output of each detector is a collection of dimensionless strain measurements .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 such measurements are made with each detector at regular time intervals .",
    "denote these measurements by a @xmath1 matrix @xmath2 with components @xmath3 , where @xmath4 labels the detector , and @xmath5 is a time index . to determine whether or not the data @xmath2 contains some desired signal , one usually compares the value of some detection statistic @xmath6 to a threshold value @xmath7 .",
    "that is , if @xmath8 one concludes that a signal is present and otherwise one concludes that no signal is present .",
    "a detection statistic is said to be optimal if it yields the smallest probability of mistakenly concluding a signal is present ( false alarm probability ) after choosing a threshold which fixes the probability for mistakenly concluding a signal is absent ( false dismissal probability ) .",
    "assume that the two detectors are collocated and aligned , and that each detector has white gaussian noise with vanishing mean with no correlations between the two detectors .",
    "then the standard cross - correlation detection statistic @xmath9 for a gaussian signal is @xmath10 where @xmath11 for @xmath4 , and @xmath12 is the heaviside step function defined by @xmath13 this statistic is nearly optimal and can be derived from a maximum likelihood framework ( see sec .",
    "[ ss : gaussian signal ] ) .",
    "the subscript cc in @xmath9 denotes `` cross correlation '' .",
    "the generalization of this statistic to allow for colored noise and non - collocated , non - aligned detectors is discussed in refs .",

    "a particular class of events will produce a gaussian background if , on average , at any given moment , many individual events are arriving at the detector .",
    "however , if the ratio of average time between events to the average duration of events is large , then there are long stretches of `` silence '' or time during which no events arrive at the detector .",
    "the resulting stochastic background is non - gaussian as the conditions for the applicability of the central limit theorem are not satisfied .",
    "recent work has suggested that some candidate gravitational wave stochastic backgrounds , of both cosmological and astrophysical origin , may be non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "however , predictions concerning the properties of most gravitational wave background sources rely heavily on theoretical arguments which extrapolate well beyond observational support .",
    "such extrapolations are always in some sense speculative .",
    "it is conceivable that backgrounds predicted to be gaussian may in fact turn out to be non - gaussian , or vice versa .    in sec .",

    "let @xmath3 be the outputs of two collocated aligned gravitational wave detectors with white , zero - mean , gaussian noise with no correlations between the two detectors .",
    "the detector outputs @xmath3 consist of noise @xmath14 together with a common signal @xmath15 : @xmath16 we wish to detect a non - gaussian signal @xmath15 composed of long stretches of silence which separate short bursts whose amplitudes are gaussianly distributed , and whose durations are smaller than the detector resolution time ( see fig .",

    "as is well known , the computational cost of trying to detect a stochastic background using the cross - correlation statistic @xmath9 is negligible when compared to , say , matched - filter - based inspiral waveform searches .",

    "the computational cost of computing @xmath22 is larger than that of computing @xmath9 by a factor anywhere from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .    to summarize , under the idealized assumptions of this paper , if one searches for a stochastic background using the standard cross - correlation statistic , then one might not detect a signal that would have been detectable using our maximum likelihood statistic .",

    "<S> a gravitational wave stochastic background can be produced by a collection of independent gravitational wave events . </S>",
    "<S> there are two classes of such backgrounds , one for which the ratio of the average time between events to the average duration of an event is small ( i.e. , many events are on at once ) , and one for which the ratio is large . in the first case the signal is continuous , </S>",
    "<S> sounds something like a constant _ hiss _ , and has a gaussian probability distribution . in the second case </S>",
    "<S> , the discontinuous or intermittent signal sounds something like popcorn popping , and is described by a non - gaussian probability distribution . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we address the issue of finding an optimal detection method for such a non - gaussian background . as a first step , we examine the idealized situation in which the event durations are short compared to the detector sampling time , so that the time structure of the events can not be resolved , and we assume white , gaussian noise in two collocated , aligned detectors . </S>",
    "<S> for this situation we derive an appropriate version of the maximum likelihood detection statistic . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the performance of this statistic to that of the standard cross - correlation statistic both analytically and with monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in general the maximum likelihood statistic performs better than the cross - correlation statistic when the stochastic background is sufficiently non - gaussian , resulting in a gain factor in the minimum gravitational - wave energy density necessary for detection . </S>",
    "<S> this gain factor ranges roughly between 1 and 3 , depending on the duty cycle of the background , for realistic observing times and signal strengths for both ground and space based detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the computational cost of the statistic , although significantly greater than that of the cross - correlation statistic , is not unreasonable . before the statistic can be used in practice with real detector data , further work is required to generalize our analysis to accommodate separated , misaligned detectors with realistic , colored , non - gaussian noise . </S>"
