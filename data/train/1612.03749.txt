    "according to the general theory of relativity , there is a possibility to form a wormhole by connecting two different spacetime regions of the universe @xcite .",
    "recently traversable wormhole solutions were found by morris and thorne @xcite , who argued that , if traversable wormholes exist , one needs to invoke a negative energy at the throat which sometimes is known as exotic matter @xcite .",
    "the idea was put forward by visser , who introduced the concept of thin shell wormholes , which allows us to construct a wormhole simply by cutting and pasting two space - time regions @xcite .",
    "this method attracted a lot of interest among physicists and a number of papers have been written on this topic ( see for example@xcite ) .    in a seminal paper , unruh @xcite , for the first time found an analogy connecting black holes and sonic black holes and raised the question whether is possible to detect the hawking radiation ( sometimes known as hawkingunruh radiation ) in a laboratory @xcite .",
    "one can show that , under linearized perturbations , the equations of motion of a moving fluid is an equivalent way to describe the propagation of a massless scalar field in a curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "one particular example is to study the wave equation for sound waves in a moving fluid as an analogue for light waves in a curved spacetime@xcite .    in the context of analogue",
    "black hole models a number of interesting analogue metrics have been found , up to a conformal factor . in particular , the schwarzschild type metric solution known as a canonical acoustic metric and the painlevegullstrand acoustic metric @xcite , a rotating analogue metric @xcite , analogue ads and ds black hole solutions @xcite and references therein .",
    "furthermore nandi et",
    "al @xcite introduced the idea of acoustic traversable wormholes and showed that this analogy model can be used to investigate the nature of curvature singularity , to study the light ray trajectories in an optical medium is equivalent to the sound trajectories in its acoustic analog . on the other hand ,",

    ", we aim to model a spherically symmetric , thin shell wormhole within the framework of analogue gravity systems .",
    "in particular , we aim to explore the stability of the acoustic wormhole by modeling the analogue fluid with a linear barotropic fluid(lbf ) @xcite , chaplygin fluid ( cf ) @xcite , logarithmic fluid ( logf ) @xcite , polytropic eqiation of state for the fluid , @xcite , van der waals quintessence ( vdwq ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the canonical acoustic metric . in section 3",
    ", we construct an analogue , canonical thin shell wormhole and show show that an analog exotic fluid with negative energy is required at the throat to keep the wormhole stable . in section 4 we investigate the stability analyses by modeling the analogue fluid by a linear barotropic fluid ( lbf ) , chaplygin fluid ( cf ) , and logarithmic fluid ( logf ) , polytropic fluid and van der waals quintessence ( vdwq ) . in section 5 ,",
    "we comment on our results .",
    "we can start by writing the spherically symmetric solution of incompressible fluid or the so  called canonical acoustic black hole metric found by visser written as follows @xcite @xmath0    in which @xmath1 is the speed of sound through the fluid , @xmath2 is the fluid velocity , and @xmath3 is the laboratory time .",
    "morover @xmath1 is related with the velocity @xmath2 as follows @xmath4    however it is more convenient to write the metric as a schwarzschild type metric .",
    "if we introduce the schwarzschild time coordinate @xmath5 , which is related to the laboratory time @xmath3 by the following coordinate transformation @xmath6    then , it s not difficult to show that we end up with a spherically symmetric acustic metric also known as a canonical acoustic black hole as @xcite @xmath7 in which @xmath8    the event horizon of the canonical acoustic black hole is computed by solving @xmath9 , so that one gets @xmath10    the corresponding gravitational acceleration for the acoustic black hole horizon can be computed as follows @xmath11    the analogue hawking temperature for the canonical acoustic black holes due to the emission of phonons is given by @xcite @xmath12    without loss of generality from now on we can set the speed of sound to unity , i.e. @xmath13 . in what follows we are going to make use of the metric to model catsw .",
    "let us now proceed to use cut and paste technique to construct a catsw using the metric and choosing two identical regions @xmath14 in which @xmath15 is choosen to be grater than the event horizon @xmath16 . if we now paste these regular regions at the boundary hypersurface @xmath17 , then we end up with a complete manifold @xmath18 . in accordance with the darmoisisrael formalism the coordinates on @xmath19 can be choosen as @xmath20 . on the other hand for the coordinates on the induced metric @xmath21 we write @xmath22 which are related to the coordinates on @xmath19 by the following coordinate transformation @xmath23    finally for the parametric equation on the induced metric @xmath21 we write @xmath24    note that in order to study the dynamics of the induced metric @xmath21 , in the last equation we let the throat radius of the wormhole to be time dependent by incorporating the proper time on the shell i.e. , @xmath25 .",
