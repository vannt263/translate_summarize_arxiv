    "the abelian sandpile growth model is a diffusion process for configurations of chips placed on vertices of the @xmath6-dimensional integer lattice @xmath7 . when a vertex in @xmath7 _ topples _ , it loses @xmath1 chips itself , adding one chip to each of its @xmath1 neighbors in the lattice . for any finite nonnegative initial distribution of chips",
    ", one can topple vertices with at least @xmath1 chips until no more such topplings are possible , and , remarkably , neither the final configuration nor the number of topplings which occur at each vertex depend on the order in which topplings are performed  the process is in this sense abelian , as first noticed in @xcite",
    ".    introduced in @xcite , the sandpile growth model has been the subject of extensive study over the past two decades , both on @xmath7 and on general graphs . nevertheless , many of the earliest and most fundamental questions regarding the sandpile remain unanswered ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we remark that weak-@xmath17 convergence seems to be the correct notion of convergence for the rescaled sandpiles .",
    "recall that @xmath25 denotes the space of bounded measurable functions on @xmath26 and that @xmath27 denotes the continuous functions on @xmath26 with compact support . a sequence of functions @xmath28 converges weakly-@xmath17 to a function @xmath29 in @xmath25 if @xmath30 for all test functions @xmath31 . if we look closely at the gray regions of the sandpiles ( see figure [ sandzoom ] ) , we see that they consist of rapidly oscillating patterns , as first noticed in @xcite .",
    "it seems clear that no kind of pointwise convergence of the sandpiles can hold , assuming this behavior persists as @xmath4 .",
    "instead , the sandpiles converge in the sense that the oscillating regions converge to their average value ; there is some limiting image @xmath19 in which the `` colors '' of points are real numbers , approximated in the sequence @xmath32 by patterns of integers .",
    "the convergence of a sequence of bounded functions in local average value is precisely what weak-@xmath17 convergence in @xmath25 is designed to capture @xcite .",
    "sandpile on @xmath14 .",
    "notice the patterned triangular shapes .",
    "[ sandzoom ] ]    note that the properties of @xmath19 stated in the second part of the theorem are to demonstrate that the weak-@xmath17 convergence is not for trivial reasons such as a poor choice of the rescaling : the mass of the limit is 1 and is not being `` rescaled away '' ; similarly , the rescaled sandpiles are contained within a ball of a fixed size .",
    "the best known upper bound on the diameter of the this ball @xcite is that for every @xmath33 there is a @xmath34 such that @xmath35 for all @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the volume of the unit ball .",
    "although our goal will be the characterization of final chip configurations , we will really be studying the number of topples which occur at each vertex as an initial configuration stabilizes .",
    "given an initial configuration of chips and some finite sequence @xmath38 of points at which we topple piles of chips , the sequence is _ legal _ if the sequence never topples any vertex with fewer than @xmath1 chips , and _ stabilizing _ if the final configuration has fewer than @xmath1 chips at each vertex . given any legal sequence @xmath39 and any stabilizing sequence @xmath40 both beginning from some fixed intial configuation , we must have @xmath41 for some @xmath42 , since there must be at least @xmath1 chips at the point @xmath43 in the initial configuration , since @xmath44 is legal , and these chips must topple in any stabilizing sequence .",
    "since the permuted sequence @xmath45 is also stabilizing , we can apply the same argument again from the configuration obtained after toppling just at @xmath41 , to get that there must be a @xmath46 . continuing in this manner",
    ", we obtain that the sequence @xmath44 is a permutation of some subsequence of @xmath47 .",
    "the above argument , a simplification of what appeared in @xcite , implies that for any fixed initial configuration of chips , any two legal stabilizing sequences must be permutations of each other .",
    "coupled with the fact that any finite initial configuration of chips on @xmath7 will eventually stabilize after some legal sequence of topples , this implies that there is a well - defined _ odometer function _",
    "@xmath48 associated to any initial configuration , which counts the number of topples which will occur at points of the lattice in any legal stabilizing sequence of topples .",
    "this also implies the abelian property of the sandpile , as the final chip configuration @xmath19 is uniquely determined by the odometer function .",
    "note that it can be computed simply as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial configuration of chips , and the sum is taken over the @xmath1 neighbors @xmath51 of @xmath52 in the lattice @xmath7 .",
    "thus we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath55-point discrete laplacian on @xmath7 .",
    "the starting point of our proof is the _ least action principle _ formulated in @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath56 is the odometer function for some initial configuration @xmath50 of chips , and @xmath48 is any function that satisfies @xmath57 the least action principle states that we must have @xmath58 .",
    "note that this follows immediately from the fact that legal sequences are permutations of subsequences of stabilizing sequences , since @xmath56 corresponds to a stabilizing _ and _ legal sequence , while @xmath59 corresponds to a stablizing , not necessarily legal sequence .",
    "the important consequence of the least action principle for us is that the odometer function associated with a configuration is the pointwise minimum of all functions @xmath48 satisfying @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the initial configuration of chips . in our case ,",
    "if @xmath62 is the odometer function resulting from an initial configuration of @xmath3 chips at the origin , we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath65 . the final configuration of chips is then @xmath66    this description of @xmath62 and @xmath67 , together with standard estimates for the @xmath55-point laplacian @xmath54 , will easily give convergence of the rescaled @xmath32 and the rescaled odometer function @xmath68 along _ subsequences _ @xmath69 .    to obtain convergence , we show that the limiting @xmath19 and @xmath59 are independent of the choice of subsequence .",
    "assuming there are two distinct limits @xmath59 and @xmath70 , we use the regularity theory of the laplacian to select a point @xmath71 where @xmath59 and @xmath70 are sufficiently smooth and @xmath72 is strictly concave .",
    "we then select sufficiently close finite approximations @xmath73 and @xmath74 and use @xmath75 to `` lower '' @xmath76 , contradicting the least action principle for @xmath62 .",
    "the difficultly lies in the fact that @xmath76 and @xmath75 are defined on possibly incompatible lattices .",
