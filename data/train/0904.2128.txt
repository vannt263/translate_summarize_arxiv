    "soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) binary systems that occasionally go into episodes of high activity or _ outbursts _ are some of the best laboratories to study accretion flows near compact ( @xmath2 ) objects .",
    "coordinated multi - wavelength campaigns have been carried out in recent years to observe sxts simultaneously over a broad frequency range of nine decades or more from radio to x - rays .",
    "these campaigns have provided extremely valuable insights about the accretion in / outflows and helped to constrain the theoretical models predicting accretion geometry and physical emission processes .",
    "outbursts of sxts are usually explained in terms of a disc instability model ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) , postulating a dramatic increase in mass accretion via an accretion disc towards the central compact object .",
    "the luminosity of a black hole transient ( bht ) can vary by as much as eight orders of magnitude between quiescence and peak outburst , within timescales of weeks to months .",
    "such systems are also ideal for studying the formation of jets , which are a by - product of accretion , yet poorly understood so far .",
    "matter spiralling into the gravitational potential well of the compact object forms an accretion disc , and radiates via dissipation of the accumulated gravitational potential energy .",
    "the observed uv and soft x - ray spectra of these sources , during epochs of high mass accretion rate , are well modeled by viscous dissipation from the inner regions of a geometrically thin , optically thick `` shakura  sunyaev disc '' @xcite .",
    "however in the oir , the viscously dissipating disc model sometimes significantly underpredicts the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and the excess is attributed to irradiation of the outer disc by the intense x - ray radiation from the inner region close to the compact object .",
    "this irradiation mechanism has been well explored theoretically @xcite and their effect observed in optical and near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most prominent , observable effect of irradiation is to heat up the outer regions of the accretion disc to temperatures higher than what would be possible solely by viscous dissipation of a standard shakura - sunyaev disc .",
    "this leads to a deviation in the shape of the sed of the accretion disc ( from that of a standard disc ) , creating a ` bump ' in the optical through infra - red ( oir ) wavelengths .",
    "as the quality of the oir data improves , the deviation ( i.e. the bump ) from shakura - sunyaev spectrum becomes more and more apparent , and the need to incorporate irradiation in the model becomes important .    in roche lobe overflowing bhts where the accretor is",
    "10 times or more heavier than the donor , x - ray irradiation of the donor is small .",
    "furthermore irradiation causes the outer disc to flare , shielding most of the donor star from irradiation @xcite .",
    "while most models assume an azimuthally symmetric accretion disc , warping of the accretion disc ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) can introduce additional uncertainities in shielding the donor from irradiation .",
    "not all the mass accreted inwards falls onto the compact object .",
    "outflows , in the form of steady compact jets , or transient , ballistic ejecta are often seen in compact binary systems .",
    "steady , compact jets have been observed from an increasing number of compact binary systems when they are in an _ x - ray hard state _ ( see below ) .",
    "the hallmark signature of such a jet is its flat to slightly inverted spectrum which , following the classic work by @xcite , is usually attributed to a superposition of self - absorbed synchrotron emission from segments of a collimated jet . for stellar bhts the flat spectrum of the jet",
    "is expected to extend from radio frequencies up to ir ( @xmath3 hz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , beyond which the jet synchrotron becomes optically thin ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at x - ray frequencies ,",
    "inverse compton ( ic ) upscattering in the jet base of synchrotron as well as external photons from the accretion disc can become comparable and may even dominate the spectrum . as shown in @xcite , synchrotron and ic at the jet base can result in spectra very similar to those produced by compact comptonizing coronal models @xcite .",
    "during the course of an outburst , the x - ray spectral and temporal features show an enormous amount of diversity",
    ". however extensive observations and their analyses over the past few decades have enabled the classification of spectral and temporal features into relatively few groups known as _ x - ray states _ . in particular ,",
    "two canonical states are often seen : a `` soft '' state characterized by strong thermal emission from the accretion disc and low variability in the light curve , and a `` hard '' state characterized by non - thermal power law emission , high variability and probably a collimated outflow . besides these canonical states",
    ", a host of intermediate and extreme states with varying ratios of thermal and non - thermal radiation also are seen .",
    "recent oir observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) covering complete outbursts of many xrbs have shown that while irradiation usually plays a dominant role in the evolution of the oir spectrum during the entire outbursting phase , the contribution from a non - thermal source , e.g. a jet , can become dominant when xrbs ( most notably black holes ) are in hard state .",
    "thus any model which aims to understand disc - jet coupling must include irradiation .",
    "we have developed a new spectral model which calculates continuum emission from an irradiated accretion disc , and in conjunction with a modified version of the compact jet model developed by @xcite , allows us to constrain the geometrical and radiative properties not only of the jet , but simultaneously those of the accretion disc .",
    "the thermal photons from the irradiated disc are also included in the photon field of the jet for compton scattering , although due to doppler redshifting in the jet frame , this external compton emission is usually much smaller than the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) .",
    "the new model is fully integrable with the standard spectral analysis software isis @xcite and parallelizable for using in large cluster computing environments ( also see  [ sec : parallel ] ) .",
    "we have used this new model to analyze broad band quasi - simultaneous observations of two galactic bht systems xte  j1118 + 480 and gx  339@xmath04 . simultaneous or quasi - simultaneous observations of both sources , during hard x - ray state of their outbursts , have revealed broad band continuum emission ranging from radio to x - rays , strongly suggesting the presence of jets @xcite . by studying short time - scale variability in near - ir wavelengths from xte  j1118 + 480 , @xcite also suggested a non - thermal origin of the near - ir radiation , with a power law index typical of optically thin synchrotron emission from a jet .",
    "the known physical properties of the two sources xte  j1118 + 480 and gx  339@xmath04 have been briefly summarized in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "since analysis of multi - wavelength data requires careful calibration of data from various ground - based as well as space - borne instruments , we have also presented the data reduction and calibration procedures in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "a brief outline of the model , with somewhat more emphasis on the newly introduced irradiated disc component , is given in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , along with a description of the fitting procedure .",
    "the results of our broad band sed modeling suggest that despite the differences in size , mass , orbital parameters or accretion state , some of the fundamental physical parameters characterizing the geometrical and radiative properties of the jet are similar for both sources .",
    "this similarity may be a global property of jets formed near compact objects and is discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "xte  j1118 + 480 and gx  339@xmath04 are two prototype galactic bhts with markedly different properties .",
    "both binary systems contain high mass compact objects , @xmath4 for xte  j1118 + 480 @xcite and @xmath5 for gx  339@xmath04 @xcite , thus strongly suggesting for the compact objects to be black holes in both cases .",
    "xte  j1118 + 480 lies @xmath6 north of galactic plane , in the halo .",
    "it has an orbital period of @xmath7 hours @xcite .",
    "the distance and interstellar column density to xte  j1118 + 480 are reasonably well known from oir photometry during quiescence to be @xmath8 kpc and @xmath9 @xmath10 respectively @xcite .",
    "we adopted a black hole mass of @xmath11 for this source .",
    "the orbital inclination of xte  j1118 + 480 , as measured by @xcite is @xmath12 degrees .",
    "gx  339@xmath04 lies near the galactic plane , only @xmath13 south of the galactic equator and has an orbital period of @xmath14 hours @xcite .",
    "we adopted a black hole mass of @xmath15 for gx  339@xmath04 in this work .",
    "the secondary star in the gx  339@xmath04 system has eluded detection so far , thus making estimates of masses , distance or line of sight extinction difficult .",
    "here we have used a distance of 6 kpc and @xmath16 @xmath10 for gx  339@xmath04 , which are consistent with the limits given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "xte  j1118 + 480 went through an outburst during january  february 2005 .",
    "a discussion of the oir light curve morphology of the 2005 oir outburst of xte  j1118 + 480 is presented by @xcite .",

    "for this source we used quasi - simultaneous optical ( from the liverpool telescope ) , near - ir ( from ukirt ) and 15 ghz radio data ( from the ryle telescope ) .",
    "the full set of multi - wavelength observations obtained during this outburst of xte  j1118 + 480 will be presented in brocksopp et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "xte  j1118 + 480 went through an outburst in 2000 as well . during this outburst",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the source was observed quasi - simultaneously around 2000 april 18th using the ryle radio telescope , ukirt , hst , euve , chandra and rxte giving an unprecedented broadband spectral coverage .",
    "this excellent data set has been used in several works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) to infer properties of the source .",
    "we revisit this data set to constrain the geometry and radiative properties of both the jet and the disc using our new disc+jet model .",
    "we used the oir and radio sed of gx  339@xmath04 reported by @xcite , which were obtained during a multi - wavelength campaign to observe its outburst of 2002 . for all data sets we used the photometric oir magnitudes and de - reddened them using the interstellar extinction law of @xcite . in the absence of definitive measurement of the ratio of total to selective extinction ( @xmath17 $ ] ) in the direction of either of the sources , we have taken @xmath18 , the widely used value measured by @xcite towards the galactic center , and standardly used for these sources .",
    "thus it must be kept in mind that if the `` true '' value of @xmath19 is significantly different from @xmath20 ( given neither of the sources are very close to the galactic center ) , it might introduce additional uncertainity in reddening correction .",

    "also any data with pointing offset more than @xmath22 , or within 30 minutes of saa passage , or trapped electron contamination ratio more than 0.1 were rejected .",
    "since both the sources were bright ( pcu2 count rate @xmath23 counts / s / pcu ) , the model _ pca_bkgd_cmbrightvle_emv20051128.mdl _ was used for background subtraction .",
    "data from all the layers of the active pcus during the observations were extracted to create the spectra .",
    "systematic uncertainty of 0.5% was added in quadrature to the pca data to account for uncertainties in the calibration . for the hexte instrument , data from both clusters were added .",
    "both pca and hexte data were binned to achieve a minimum @xmath24 of 4.5 . for the pca we used the energy range of 322 kev and for hexte 20200 kev .",
    "the normalization of the oir and radio data was tied to that of pca .",
    "hexte normalization was allowed to vary .",
    "the continuum jet model used in this work is based on @xcite , ( henceforth referred to as the agnjet model ) . given the importance of irradiation in the observed spectra of xrbs , we have modified the model to include additional physics ( see  [ sec : irrad ] for details ) that allow us to calculate the effect of irradiation on the outer disc due to high energy photons from ( 1 ) the jet , and ( 2 ) the inner regions close to the compact object , impinging on the disc .",
    "we also compute inverse compton scattering of thermal disc photons by the electrons in the jet plasma , although their effect on the total spectrum is negligible , except near the jet base , due to doppler redshifting of the disc photons in the jet frame .      the details of the physics of the jet model as well as a full description of its main input parameters",
    "is given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "therefore we only give a brief summary here , and outline the modifications made to the @xcite model :    the main parameters that determine the properties of the jet are the input jet power ( @xmath25 ) , electron temperature of the relativistic thermal plasma entering at the jet base ( @xmath26 ) , the ratio of magnetic to particle energy density ( a.k.a . the equipartition factor @xmath27 ) , physical dimensions of the jet base ( assumed to be cylindrical with radius @xmath28 and height @xmath29 ) , and the location of the point on the jet ( @xmath30 ) beyond which the a significant fraction of the leptons are accelerated to a power law energy distribution .",
    "@xmath25 , parameterized in terms of the eddington luminosity , determines the power initially input into the particles and magnetic field at the base of the jets . in the absence of a full understanding of the mechanism for energizing the jets",
    ", @xmath25 plays a similar role to the compactness parameter in thermal comptonization models @xcite .",
    "a typical value of the number density of leptons ( @xmath31 ) at the base of the jet ( derived from fits ) is @xmath32 @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the eddington luminosity of the source , @xmath35 is the sound speed at the base ( see below ) , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the proton rest mass , and @xmath38 cm is the radius of the jet base , implying an optical depth @xmath39 . since the optical depth is small , the probability of multiple compton scattering is very small and we only consider single scattering . for the non - thermal power law electrons , the lower cutoff in the lorentz factor",
    "is assumed to be equal to peak of the relativistic maxwell - juttner distribution , i.e. @xmath40 .    following the prescription of @xcite for maximally efficient jets , we assume that the bulk speed of the plasma ( with adiabatic index @xmath41 ) at the base of the jet is the sound speed given by @xmath42 .",
    "we do not model the particle acceleration in the jet , but just start at the sonic point .",
    "each jet then accelerates longitudinally along its axis due to pressure gradient and expands laterally with its initial sound speed . the bulk velocity profile , magnetic field strength , electron density and electron lorentz factor along the jet are calculated by solving the adiabatic , relativistic euler equation .    in the previous versions of the jet model ( e.g. in *",
    "* ) we used the ratio of scattering mean free path to gyroradius of the particles in the plasma through which the shock moves ( @xmath43 ) , as a model parameter .",
    "however given the current lack of physical understanding of the actual shock propagation mechanism , in this paper we fixed the shock speed in the plasma ( @xmath44 ) to @xmath45 and used the quantity @xmath46(ratio of scattering mean free path to gyroradius ) as a model parameter instead of @xmath43 .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 can be physically interpreted to be a parametrization for the shock acceleration rate ( @xmath48 ; see eq.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the dominant cooling processes within the jet are synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton radiation .",
    "if the inner edge of the accretion disc is sufficiently close to the base of the jet , then the soft photons from the accretion disc , acting as seed photons for external comptonization , can also cool the particles in the jet .",
    "the jet continuum as observed by an observer on earth is a superposition of spectra from individual segments along the jet axis ( taken to be perpendicular to the accretion disc plane ) , calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation , after taking into account relativistic beaming effects .",
    "since the coupling between disc and jet is not well understood , we assume an independent classical thermal viscous `` shakura - sunyaev '' accretion disc , with a radial temperature profile @xmath49 , and modeled by the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , the temperature and radius at the inner edge of the disc . if the outer parts of the disc are irradiated , then as discussed below , it is further possible to constrain the temperature and radius at the outer edge of the disc . given the mounting evidence for the existence of relativistic outflows from black holes , we also explore the influence of the jet acting as a source of irradiation heating of the accretion disc .",
    "we computed the radiative jet flux incident on the accretion disc as a function of radial distance on the disc plane , taking into account special relativistic beaming effects . in order to obtain an",
    "_ upper limit _ on the jet - induced heating of the accretion disc , we assumed that the entire incident radiative flux from the jet @xmath52 is thermalized upon being absorbed by the disc , thus heating the disc locally at radius @xmath53 at a rate @xmath54 , given by @xmath55    we calculated @xmath54 at ten logarithmically spaced radii spanning from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath54 to the local viscous heating ( @xmath58 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jet_irrad ] . at large radii",
    "( @xmath59 @xmath60 ) , @xmath54 has a @xmath61 radial profile , which is somewhat steeper than that expected from irradiation by a static corona or the inner accretion disc ( for which the irradiation heating falls as @xmath62 ; see , e.g. ,  [ sec : disc_irrad ] and @xcite ) .",
    "however the local viscous heating rate drops outward even faster ( @xmath63 ) , thus causing the ratio @xmath64 to slowly increase for increasing r. as the disc radius becomes small and approaches that of the jet base , the solid angle subtended by the jet increases rapidly causing the jet heating to saturate",
    ". however the viscous heating continues to rise at smaller radii and causes @xmath64 to drop at small radii .",
    "however , as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : jet_irrad ] , even the maximum possible jet - induced heating of the disc is about seven orders of magnitude smaller than the viscous heating .",
    "this confirms that relativistic beaming of the jet causes a very small fraction of the flux emitted by the jet to fall back on the disc , and the resulting influence of the jet on the energetics of the disc is negligible .",
    "light bending effects near the black hole can enhance the flux incident on the disc , but by not more than a few tens of percent of the numbers calculated above ( i.e. by assuming minkowski metric instead of a more realistic kerr or schwarzschild metric ) .",
    "analysis of oir light curves of xte  j1118 + 480 by @xcite suggests there might have been significant contribution of thermal flux in the optical .",
    "the near - ir flux however is reported to be significantly non - thermal in nature from studies of rapid time variability in the light curve , as well as nearly flat ir sed @xcite . as discussed in the previous paragraph as well as",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jet_irrad ] , the jet s contribution in heating the disc is negligible ; we have therefore added an irradiation heating term due to a somewhat more static source of irradiating x - rays near the black hole .",
    "the physical origin of this irradiating source could be the inner accretion disc near the black hole . since we assume a radial temperature profile and do not solve the local disc structure ( which in itself is a detailed mhd problem , see , e.g. ,",
    "* and references therein ) , our model can not discern the source of the irradiating x - rays .",
    "the temperature due to irradiation heating ( @xmath65 ) is usually assumed to have a power law radial dependence of the form @xmath66 .",
    "depending on the initial assumptions about disc structure and geometry of the irradiating source , theoretical models predict @xmath31 to be in the range of 0.4 - 0.5 @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainities in de - reddening and scarcity of data points in the oir , the exact choice of @xmath31 is not vital for a global understanding of the broad - band sed .",
    "we used @xmath67 ( vertically isothermal disc with disc height @xmath68 ) , mainly for consistency with earlier work .",
    "we assume that the total disc heating is a sum of local viscous heating , and heating due to a static source of irradiation near the black hole .",
    "the effective temperature of the disc ( @xmath69 ) is therefore related to the viscous temperature ( @xmath70 ) and the irradiation temperature ( @xmath65 ) as follows :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 as free parameters .",
    "other parameters , viz .",
    "masses , inclination and distance to the binary system , are taken from values published elsewhere and kept fixed during the process of fitting .",
    "the radius @xmath76 where irradiation heating becomes equal to viscous heating can be estimated from @xmath77^{28/9}.\\ ] ] since viscous dissipation dominates for @xmath78 , the disc height at @xmath76 is estimated from shakura - sunyaev s @xmath79-disc solution ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) as @xmath80    where we have @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83^{1/4}$ ] and chosen @xmath84 . similarly , since @xmath85 when @xmath86 , the disc height at @xmath57 is given by @xmath87 the solid angle subtended by the outer , irradiation dominated disc as seen from the compact object is computed from equations  [ eq : h_irrad ] and  [ eq : h_out ] .",
    "the agnjet model computes the broadband continuum from the jet and the irradiated disc but not line emission or reflection features .",
    "therefore we used an additional gaussian line profile to fit the iron k@xmath79 emission complex near 6.5 kev and the convolution model reflect @xcite for the excess in the range of 1030 kev , both features being usually attributed to reflection by the relatively cold accretion disc .",
    "the column density , taken from elsewhere published values , was fixed during the fits . for the reflect model , which accounts for reflection from neutral material in the accretion disc , we used solar abundance and tied the inclination to that of the disc ( and also the jet axis ) .",
    "the energy of the iron line in the gaussian model was allowed to vary between 67 kev and its width was fixed to 0.5 kev .",
    "the spectral coverage , along with column density ( @xmath88 ) towards the sources , distances , and masses of the compact objects are given in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "spectral fittings were performed using isis ( v1.4.9 - 4 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "evaluation of confidence intervals for any physical model is computationally expensive , and this is true for agnjet model as well .",
    "therefore we have used the parallelization technique described in @xcite and distributed the task of computing confidence intervals for @xmath89 free parameters over @xmath90 or @xmath91 nodes ( depending on whether @xmath89 is even or odd ; each node is an intel xeon 3.4ghz processor ) of a parallel virtual machine @xcite running on the lisa cluster in almere , netherlands .",
    "this reduced the runtime to under 24 hours , a greater than 75% speedup ; it also allowed us to discern finer features in parameter space by increasing the tolerance resolution by a factor of 500 , while keeping the overall runtime to approximately half the serial runtime of 96 hours .",
    "while these are welcome improvements , reducing the model runtime even further would enable us to analyze new data more quickly .",
    "for this reason we are experimenting with ways of utilizing more than one processor per parameter , such as partitioning parameter space more finely , and exploring the use of openmp @xcite to parallelize internal loops within the model source code .    using the distributed parallel computing technique described above , we determined the best - fit parameter values as well as their confidence intervals .",
    "our confidence intervals correspond to @xmath92 for a given parameter ( which for _ normal _ distribution would imply a @xmath93 single parameter confidence limit ) .      of the three data sets presented in this work , the data from the 2005 outburst of xte  j1118 + 480 was the faintest and had a steep power law slope in the x - rays .",
    "the flux in the hexte bands was extremely low for this data and while regrouping the data we found that no flux with s / n @xmath94 could be detected above 60 kev . since the single point in the radio frequency",
    "does not constrain the length of the jet , we fixed it to @xmath95 cm which is a lower limit on the radiative length of the jet assuming that the radio data point is still on the optically thick synchrotron regime with a flat - to - slightly - inverted spectral index .",
    "while the fits require a high fraction of non - thermal electrons in the post - shock jet ( @xmath96 ) , they are not very sensitive to the exact value of this fraction , and we fixed its value to 0.75 . the data can not be described by a non - thermal jet continuum alone and an excess in the oir data requires additional flux which we modeled using the irradiated accretion disc model described in ",
    "[ sec : irrad ] .",
    "this thermal excess in the optical has also been suggested from the oir coverage of the outburst by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the x - ray data ( 360 kev ) can be well fit ( @xmath97 ) only with a power law , however systematic residuals in the 57 kev range suggest that a weak iron line may be present . adding a gaussian line to the power law improves the fits to @xmath98 , with the line center near 6.6 kev and width of 0.1 kev .",
    "given the weak strength of the lines , we fixed the line energy as well as the width to these values , and did not use any reflection model modeling the broad band sed of xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "fits performed by allowing @xmath51 and @xmath50 of the accretion disc to vary freely results in good fits with quite small values of both @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "there are uncertainities in our understanding of the physical properties of the innermost regions of the disc close to isco , dereddening of interstellar extinction , and also uncertainities in instrumental response and calibration .",
    "these concerns make detection of a cold disc with small @xmath51 , @xmath50 and its physical origin open to debate @xcite .",
    "another issue with the xte  j1118 + 480 data is the jet / disc inclination . while we usually fix the inclination to a value published elsewhere , the extremely flat radio to ir spectrum of xte  j1118 + 480 requires a much smaller inclination than the published value of @xmath99 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "allowing the inclination to vary for this source results in jet inclination of @xmath100 .",
    "therefore we tried two different models for this data set of xte  j1118 + 480 . in the first model ( model 1 ; second column in table  [ tab : fits ] ) , apart from other regular parameters described above , the jet / disc inclination as well as @xmath51 and @xmath50 were allowed to vary freely . in the second , somewhat more conservative model ( model 2 ; third column in table",
    "[ tab : fits ] ) , the jet inclination was fixed to @xmath101 , @xmath51 , @xmath50 were also fixed to @xmath102 @xmath60 and @xmath103 kev respectively .",
    "the best - fit values for the second model also gives similar jet parameters as the first model , although with a slightly higher jet power and steeper electron distribution index .",
    "also the second model favors a somewhat smaller and hotter outer disc edge .",
    "we used the broadband sed data of xte  j1118 + 480 obtained around 2000 april 18 , published in @xcite and @xcite . while analyzing this data set a broad dip in the combined euve and chandra spectra",
    "was noted between 0.152.5 kev ( see e.g. the residuals in fig .  [",
    "fig : j1118_2000fit ] ) which can not be modeled using the standardly used column density for this source ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this feature was been noted by previous works as well , and is attributed to metal absorption in a partially ionized gas , ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have therefore excluded the energy range between 0.152.5 kev from our broadband fitting .",
    "results of fitting indicate that during this observation emission from the jet dominates the radio and ir regions .",
    "contribution from the accretion disc starts becoming dominant in the optical .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the euve fluxes are extremely sensitive to the extinction law , and the slope of the dereddened euve sed can range between @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) for the permissible range of n@xmath107 . here",
    "we have used the euve fluxes reported by @xcite and a column depth of n@xmath108 @xmath10 , which results in a very steep euve slope .",
    "this cutoff in the euve data would imply a cold , truncated inner disc with with r@xmath109 r@xmath110 and t@xmath111 . given the low temperature of the inner disc and the consequent absence of a irradiating soft x - ray photons , it is not unexpected that we do not find any signature of irradiation in this case ( i.e. t@xmath112 is not constrained ) . as in the case of the 2005 data of this source , the x - ray emission in this model",
    "is entirely dominated by optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet . while the fits require a small nozzle ( @xmath113 ) , they are not very sensitive to the exact value of this parameter , and we fixed its value to 0.4 .",
    "we note that this value is abot a factor of three smaller than what is found typically in other sources , or even during the 2005 outburst of this source .",
    "the x - ray data of gx  339@xmath04 can not be well fit by a power law alone .",
    "using simple power law+ gaussian model gives unacceptable fit to the data with reduced @xmath114 of 5.9 .",
    "convolving a power - law+gaussian with a reflection model give better fits , but still with rather a large reduced @xmath114 of 2.3 .",
    "we found that the gx  339@xmath04 data can be fitted well without including any thermal component , and the entire broadband sed is well described by the superposition of synchrotron and inverse compton photons from the pre - shock region near the jet base as well as optically thick synchrotrons from post - shock regions farther from the jet base . from the radio - ir slope , the required inclination is between 4550 degrees , but not well constrained and hence was fixed at 47 degree .",
    "the length of the jet was fixed to @xmath115 cm and fraction of non - thermal electrons fixed to 0.75 for the same reasons given for xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "since the spectrum of gx  339@xmath04 could be entirely dominated by jet emission , and the source was in a bright , hard x - ray state @xcite , the input jet power is much larger than that of xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "in fact the jet power for this observation is larger than any of the previous observations of this source @xcite . also the acceleration region starts much farther out for the gx  339@xmath04 data set .",
    "if the temperature of the thermal electrons ( @xmath116 ) at the base is left completely free , as in `` model 1 '' ( fifth column in table  [ tab : fits ] ) , then @xmath116 for the best - fit model is comes out to be rather high , and suggests that the sed at energies @xmath117 kev is almost entirely due to ssc emission from the base ( see top two panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : gx339fit ] ) .",
    "the geometry of the base is rather compact and the source is in a bright hard state ; therefore a strong ssc emission could imply that the photon density at the base becomes high enough for pair processes to become important .",
    "since pair production is not included in the model , an estimate of the importance of pair processes for the best fit models were done as follows : the pair production rate ( @xmath118 ) was calculated from the photon field at the base of the jet using the angle averaged pair production cross section @xcite ; pair annihilation rate ( @xmath119 ) was calculated following @xcite . for `` model 1 '' of gx  339@xmath04 ,",
    "@xmath120 @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xmath121 , suggesting that pair processes could be important in this case .",
    "therefore we explored the parameter space , limiting the electron temperature to be less than @xmath123 k and somewhat less compact base ( larger r@xmath124 , h@xmath124 ) to search for solutions which also satisfy the condition @xmath125 ( see `` model 2 '' , sixth column in table  [ tab : fits ] and bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : gx339fit ] ) .",
    "the fit derived number density ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath119 and @xmath118 for the different models presented in table  [ tab : fits ] , are given in table  [ tab : pairs ] .",
    "in addition to the continuum jet model , an additional gaussian line centered at 6.3 kev and reflection from the accretion disc is needed to obtain good fits for the gx  339@xmath126 data .",
    "presence of the line and reflection suggests the presence of an accretion disc .",
    "however , as in the case for xte  j1118 + 480 , the disc is cold and therefore not detected by the pca .",
    "the best - fit model parameters , associated confidence intervals , @xmath114 statistic and corresponding chance probabilities for both sources are shown in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "given the simplicity of the model it is hardly unexpected that the reduced @xmath114 values obtained from the fitting are not very close to 1 in some cases .",
    "for instance , the viscous+irradiated disc model does not include details of disc atmosphere or ionization balance equations , and is therefore not able to predict the spectral breaks in the optical data .",
    "because of its simplicity , this is not meant to be a real model of the disc , although it incorporates the dominant ongoing physical processes and can reproduce the general shape of the broadband continuum . moreover , while fitting a data set spanning  10 decades in frequency ( or energy ) space , the long lever arm between radio and x - rays constrains the jet model more strongly than the overall chi - squared ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "best fit models along with data and residuals are shown in figures  [ fig : j1118_2005fit ] ,  [ fig : j1118_2000fit ] and  [ fig : gx339fit ] .",
    "we have analyzed broad band multi - wavelength observations of the galactic black hole transient systems xte  j1118 + 480 and gx  339@xmath04 , during their outbursts in 2000 and 2005 for xte  j1118 + 480 , and during the 2002 outburst of gx  339@xmath04 .",
    "the conclusions from our study are summarized below .",
    "the data for xte  j1118 + 480 can not be fit well with a jet continuum model alone , due to an excess in the oir fluxes . during these observations , in oir",
    "the source was at least 3.5 magnitude brighter than quiescence ; therefore the contribution from the m1 v secondary star ( * ? ? ? * and references therein )",
    "modeling the data from the 2000 outburst and 2005 outburst of this source we found that the outer disc was strongly irradiated during the 2005 data .",
    "it appears that the inner edge of the accretion disc was much closer to the central black hole during the observations of 2005 , thus providing an ample source of soft x - ray photons to irradiate the outer disc . on the other hand ,",
    "the sharp cutoff in the euve data and absence of any signature of irradiation from the outer disc suggests a recessed , cold accretion disc for the 2000 data .",
    "however , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : j1118_2000 ] , the slope of the euve data depends very strongly on the assumed column depth , and a small decrease in n@xmath127 can flatten the euve sed significantly ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such a flat euve sed would be expected from a disc with small r@xmath128 and comparatively higher t@xmath128 @xcite .",
    "our calculations in  [ sec : jet_irrad ] show that at any point on the surface of the accretion disc , the heating of the disc by the jet is seven or more orders smaller than the viscous heating .",
    "there are two factors which largely reduce the amount of jet radiation that is incident on the disc : firstly doppler de - beaming - since the bulk motion of the jet is relativistic , special relativistic doppler beaming concentrates most of the emergent radiation from the jet in the direction of its motion , i.e. away from the disc .",
    "a second , but significant factor that also contributes to the dimunition of jet flux incident on the disc is the fact that the post - shock jet synchrotron spectra peaks at increasingly longer wavelengths at increasingly larger distances from the base of the jet , thus creating fewer x - ray photons that can heat the disc .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jet_irrad ] where we show the ratio of jet - heating to viscous heating as a function of radius . since heating by the jet alone can not produce the oir excess in fig .",
    "[ fig : j1118_2005fit ] we surmised that this the oir excess is indeed caused by the more conventional form of irradiation , i.e. irradiation by soft x - ray photons from the inner - disc . from an energetics point of view , it is easy to see that the inner accretion disc alone ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : j1118_2005fit ] , at around 1 kev ) radiates at least two orders or more energy than the outer region .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that the outer edge of the accretion disc can flare - up or warp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus making the outer parts of the disc more easily visible from the inner regions",
    ".    fits to the 2005 data of xte  j1118 + 480 using the jet model+irradiated disc ( described in  [ sec : disc_irrad ] ) suggest a cold disc ( @xmath129 ) with inner radius close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( @xmath130 @xmath60 for a schwarzschild black hole , and smaller if spinning ) .",
    "given the uncertainities associated with using a simple @xmath131 model which ignores correction factors like spectral hardening @xcite , full disc structure as well as proper boundary conditions at the inner edge @xcite , the errors associated with the estimates of the inner disc parameters are most likely an underestimate .",
    "another source of uncertainity comes from that fact that we assume the jet to be perpendicular to the disc .",
    "a misaligned jet @xcite , as seems likely for xte  j1118 + 480 , could introduce additional error in the determination of @xmath51 . along with the uncertainities in instrument calibration , modeling and jet - disc alignment ,",
    "the sharp low energy cutoff of pca sensitivity below @xmath132 kev makes detection of a cold disc with small @xmath51 even more difficult than a recessed cold disc .",
    "nevertheless the numbers for @xmath51 and @xmath50 we obtained for xte  j1118 + 480 are similar to those obtained by several others for black hole transients in their hard state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if such a cold disc with small r@xmath128 is indeed realised , then compton scaterring of the disc photons could be strongly anisotropic , with most of the scattered emission beamed toward the disc @xcite .",
    "this could compensate partly the beaming effects due to the relativistic motion of the gas , and increase the illumination of the disc ( both irradiation and reflection effects ) .",
    "also in this case there could be a radiative feedback due to the local illumination of the disc by the base of the jet which is similar to the situation in standard accretion disc corona models @xcite which would act as a thermostat keeping the temperature at the base lower than what is assumed here .",
    "a somewhat more conservative model , where the temperature and radius of the inner edge of the accretion disc were fixed to @xmath103 kev and @xmath102 r@xmath133 respectively ( model 2 in table  [ tab : fits ] ) also describes the data well , showing the difficulty in detecting a cold disc with small r@xmath128 from the available data .",
    "the best - fit outer radii of xte  j1118 + 480 for both _ model 1 _ and _ model 2 _ are smaller than the circularization radius , using the latest values of orbital parameters published by @xcite .",
    "these results are therefore consistent with the assumption that accretion is occuring via roche lobe overflow .",
    "the observation was made during the decline from outburst peak .",
    "hence the discrepancy between the circularization radius and @xmath134 inferred from fits , in the context of standard disc instability models , could be due to an inward moving cooling wave .",
    "a decreasing trend in the outer _ radiative disc radius _ was also observed by @xcite for the system xte  j1859 + 226 .",
    "however the value of @xmath134 in our case depends largely on the five oir data points , all of which lie on the rayleigh - jeans region of the irradiated disc .",
    "given the plethora of spectral features seen in oir spectra of x - ray binaries in outburst ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the limitation of using a few bands is obvious .",
    "analysis of the data from the 2000 outburst of xte  j1118 + 480 by @xcite and @xcite showed that the uv and higher energy data can be explained by an adaf model .",
    "the flux from the adaf model alone however falls sharply at energies below optical and underestimates ir and any lower energy data ( e.g. radio ) , thus requiring an additional jet component @xcite . in the jet - adaf model @xcite",
    ", the x - ray photons have a thermal comptonization origin , whereas in the current work , the x - ray photons can originate from either synchrotron ( e.g in xte  j118 + 480 ) , or inverse compton scattering , or a combination of both ( e.g. in gx  339@xmath04 ) .",
    "better simultaneous broadband coverage and future x - ray polarization studies can help to estimate the relative importance of these two emission components which dominate the x - ray spectra of x - ray binaries in hard state .    from the available data ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum of xte  j1118 + 480 during both outbursts show little or no curvature at energies higher than @xmath135 kev .",
    "reflection features like the iron line complex and the reflection `` bump '' near 20 kev are also extremely weak . detailed analysis of the x - ray spectra taken by chandra and rxte , during the 2000 outburst of this source by @xcite also showed extremely weak reflection features , as would be expected for a jet+recessed disc scenario . from a phenomenological point of view , since the curvature is small , using a broken power law to describe data of x - ray binaries in hard state has been shown to work remarkably well , e.g. , for gx  339@xmath04 by @xcite and for cyg  x@xmath01 by @xcite .",
    "residuals of a power law fit to the x - ray continuum in the 2005 data set of xte  j1118 + 480 show small systematic variations near 57 kev , which improves slightly upon addition of a gaussian line .",
    "however , given the weakness of the line , its energy or width can not be constrained well .",
    "total contribution from various source of inverse comptonization ( ssc within the jet base and external comptonization of soft thermal photons from the accretion disc ) is also much smaller compared to that of gx  339@xmath04 .",
    "the x - ray region of the sed of xte  j1118 + 480 is dominated by post - shock synchrotron photons for both 2000 and 2005 outbursts .",
    "we note that the electron acceleration region seems to be in the nozzle of the jet in the case of 2005 outburst data of xte  j1118 + 480 while it is farther out in the jet in gx  339@xmath04 as well as the 2000 outburst of xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "while exhaustive searching of the @xmath114 space confirms that this is required by the data , it is not clear why the acceleration region is inside the nozzle for the 2000 data of xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "another unexpected result is that the base of the jet seems to be quite small ( @xmath136 ) for the 2000 outburst data of xte  j1118 + 480 , whereas @xmath137 for other outbursts of xte  j1118 + 480 as well as other sources ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given the uncertainties in our understanding of jet formation and the acceleration region , and the simplicity of the model , here we report the best fit parameters as obtained .",
    "the particle energy distribution index ( @xmath138 ) of the relativistic post - shock electrons for data from both outbursts of xte  j1118 + 480 is @xmath139 2.52.6 .",
    "this value is much steeper than what could be expected from an initial distribution of particles accelerated by a diffusive shock process [ ] hd1988",
    ". however it is possible that for xte  j1118 + 480 the observed x - ray bandpass is at a higher energy than the cooling break energy , where the particle distribution steepens from @xmath138 to @xmath140 due to enhanced cooling .",
    "one of the key assumptions in our model is time independence of particle distributions .",
    "however if the steep power law drop - off of the observed photon index is indeed due to enhanced cooling , or more generally a departure from the assumed equillibrium between the heating and cooling processes , a more thorough time dependent analysis of particle evolution is neccessary .",
    "we will present time dependent particle evolution in the context of jets in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the jet inclination of xte  j1118 + 480 is still a matter of concern .",
    "the optically measured system inclination is near @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "however , given the flat radio - to - ir fluxes , jet inclinations higher than @xmath142 would be very difficult to fit which might suggest a large misalignment between between the disc and the jet @xcite .",
    "evidence of misalignment between disc and jet has been seen in several stellar x - ray binary systems , e.g. , gro  j1655@xmath040 @xcite , sax  j1819@xmath02525 @xcite , xte  j1550@xmath0564 @xcite , as well as in several agns , e.g. , ngc 3079 @xcite , ngc 1068 @xcite and ngc 4258 @xcite . allowing the inclination to vary for xte  j1118 + 480 during the fits gives a best - fit inclination of @xmath143 , and it is almost impossible to find statistically good fits ( e.g. with @xmath144 ) for inclinations larger than @xmath145 .",
    "previous fits by @xcite also required a similar , small inclination .",
    "in our model we assume the lateral expansion and longitudinal acceleration of the jet to be driven solely via the solutions of the relativistic euler equation for adiabatic expansion .",
    "if this is not the case , and e.g. the jet radius and acceleration are determined by some other process(es ) leading to a stronger magnetic field and/or smaller bulk velocity along the jet , that could lead to a flatter radio - ir spectrum as well ( also see the discussion in  3.3.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the data for gx  339@xmath04 does not formally require a thermal component ( e.g. an accretion disc or emission from the secondary star ) and the entire broad band emission from radio to x - rays is satisfactorily well fit by non - thermal photons originating from pre- and post - shock synchrotron , and synchrotron self compton emission mainly from the jet base .",
    "previous fits to the 3100 kev x - ray data by @xcite also suggested that the disc contribution within this energy range is @xmath146 of the total luminosity or less",
    ". however presence of the line near 6.5 kev and signature of reflection suggests a cold accretion disc near the black hole which cuts off exponentially at an energy significantly below the lower detection limit of the rxte / pca .",
    "since the x - ray spectrum has a luminosity of @xmath147 l@xmath148 , the disc luminosity is presumably @xmath149 l@xmath148 or smaller .",
    "the data for gx  339@xmath04 were taken when the source was in a bright , x - ray hard state @xcite .",
    "the jet power @xmath25 is much higher than that obtained by @xcite , who studied data from previous outbursts of the same source .",
    "we also obtain a higher equipartition factor ( @xmath27 ) and shallower particle distribution index .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath28 and @xmath30 for gx  339@xmath04 are always found to be higher than those found for other sources .",
    "if the electron temperature at the base is left unconstrained ( e.g. `` model 1 '' in the fifth column of table  [ tab : fits ] ) , then the density of photon field from best - fit model is high enough that pair processes may become important . in this case",
    "many photons are up - scattered above the pair production threshold , and the rate at which pairs are produced is much larger than the rate at which they are annihilated , thereby changing the density at the base of the jet . constraining the electron temperature to be less than @xmath123 k , we present another fit ( `` model 2 '' , sixth column of table  [ tab : fits ] ) where the photon density at the base is small and pair production rate is much smaller than the pair annihilation rate . for this fit",
    "the the fractional pair annihilation rate @xmath150 is also much smaller than unity , so that pair processes are not important for this fit .",
    "using the irradiated disc+jet model presented in this paper we have shown that in certain cases ( e.g. the 2000 outburst data of xte  j1118 + 480 ) there are not enough x - ray photons from the inner regions to irradiate the disc appreciably .",
    "the 2005 outburst data of xte  j1118 + 480 presents an intermediate case where the contribution from an irradiated outer disc is comparable to the jet emission in oir .",

    "the fraction of particles accelerated to a power law distribution beyond @xmath30 , while not very well constrained by the fits , preferes a value in the range of 0.60.9 and is fixed to 0.75 . considering that most of the known acceleration mechanisms in astrophysics do not have such a high efficiency",
    ", this number seems rather high and requires further exploration .",
    "the particle acceleration index ( @xmath138 ) lies within 2.22.7 , which is steeper than that expected from a relativistic shock , suggesting that in these cases the x - ray energies may lie beyond the _ cooling break _",

    "mhd simulations of relativistic jet launching @xcite suggest that near the jet base , close to the launching points , the jets are mostly poynting flux dominated and have small plasma fractions ( ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure is less than unity ) .",
    "we are focusing on inner regions where this is likely still to be the case . in grbs and agn ,",
    "most data is only relevant to regions well beyond the magnetosonic fast points , where the flow has been driven towards equipartition via conversion of magnetic energy to particle energy .",
    "temperature of the thermal electrons at the jet base ( @xmath26 ) is in the range of @xmath153 k for the stellar black holes and @xmath154 k for the supermassive black holes .",

    "<S> we present results from modeling of quasi - simultaneous broad band ( radio through x - ray ) observations of the galactic stellar black hole ( bh ) transient x - ray binary ( xrb ) systems xte  j1118 + 480 and gx  339@xmath04 using an irradiated disc @xmath1 compact jet model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to quantifying the physical properties of the jet , we have developed a new irradiated disc model which also constrains the geometry and temperature of the outer accretion disc by assuming a disc heated by viscous energy release and x - ray irradiation from the inner regions . </S>",
    "<S> for the source xte  j1118 + 480 , which has better spectral coverage of the two in optical and near - ir ( oir ) wavelengths , we show that the entire broad band continuum can be well described by an outflow - dominated model @xmath1 an irradiated disc . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit radius of the outer edge of the disc is consistent with the roche lobe geometry of the system , and the temperature of the outer edge of the accretion disc is similar to those found for other xrbs . </S>",
    "<S> irradiation of the disc by the jet is found to be negligible for this source . </S>",
    "<S> for gx  339@xmath04 , the entire continuum is well described by the jet - dominated model only , with no disc component required . for the two xrbs , which have very different physical and orbital parameters and were in different accretion states during the observations , the sizes of the jet base are similar and both seem to prefer a high fraction of non - thermal electrons in the acceleration / shock region and a magnetically dominated plasma in the jet . </S>",
    "<S> these results , along with recent similar results from modeling other galactic xrbs and agns , may suggest an inherent _ unity in diversity _ in the geometric and radiative properties of compact jets from accreting black holes .    </S>",
