    "we have constructed theoretical models of red giants in both shell h - burning and core he - burning phases with the yrec code ( demarque et al .",

    "the comparison of individual frequencies and seismic parameters like @xmath1 and @xmath0 should help to determine the evolutionary phase or the stellar parameters ( e.g. , bedding et al ."
