    "x  ray emission from accreting compact objects carries information about geometry and physical conditions in the immediate vicinity of central objects . unfortunately , the information is `` encrypted '' into a series of numbers , each number ( event ) corresponding to a detection of a photon from the source . two main characteristics of each event are the photon energy and arrival time ( we neglect here polarization of radiation ) .",
    "one way of analyzing the data stream is then to project the events onto the energy axis , thus suppressing the timing information .",
    "thus obtained energy spectra give a first , rough insight into physical mechanism of emission of radiation .",
    "for example , observations of cutoffs at @xmath0 kev in low / hard state of accreting black holes demonstrate that the comptonizing electrons have a thermal rather than non - thermal distribution . from modelling the spectra a mean plasma temperature and scattering optical depth",
    "can be inferred .",
    "however , any possible distributions of plasma temperature and density can not be recovered from time - averaged spectra ( e.g.  kazanas , hua & titarchuk 1997 ; coppi 1999 ) .    in an analogous way , projecting the data onto the time axis produces a light curve , which can be analyzed either in the time or fourier domain .",
    "the results , too , enable determination of certain average properties .",
    "for example from power spectral density ( psd ) , the root mean square variability or constraints on distribution of shots time scales in the shot noise model can be found ( lehto 1989 ; lochner , swank & szymkowiak 1991 ) .",
    "further progress can be made by including at least limited information from along the other parameter axis .",
    "for example , cross - correlation analysis ( both in time and fourier domain ) reveal that higher energy x ",
    "rays lag the lower energy ones ( miyamoto & kitamoto 1989 ) , which one can attempt to interpret as e.g.  spectral evolution during a shot ( flare ) .",
    "then the energy dependent auto - correlation functions give average shot profiles as a function of energy ( see review in poutanen 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "similarly , studying a sequence of energy spectra , each one averaged over a certain short time interval , enables determination of not only the mean spectral properties , but also `` higher orders '' statistics properties .",
    "the most important result that has emerged recently is that spectral properties of a given source vary with time , but correlations between parameters exist .",
    "the power law slope , @xmath1 , is correlated with the amplitude of reflection @xmath2 and the width of the fe line ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ; gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 1999 ; revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov 2001 ; ycki , done & smith 1998 ) .",
    "interestingly , the same correlations seem to exist between sources in a sample ( zdziarski et al .  1999 ; lubiski & zdziarski 2001 ) .",
    "a number of geometrical / physical scenarios can be built based on the @xmath2@xmath1 correlation alone .",
    "the crucial element of all models is the feedback between the hot , x  ray emitting plasma and the cooler , optically thick plasma : most of the soft photons crossing the hot plasma have to come from thermalization / reprocessing of the illuminating hard x",
    " rays ( poutanen 1998 and references therein ) . given this condition alone",
    ", models can be constructed belonging to two main classes , ( 1 ) with the standard accretion disc disrupted at a certain radius , and ( 2 ) with the standard accretion disc extending to the last stable orbit :    * standard accretion disc disrupted at a given radius , and filled with hot , optically thin , x  ray producing flow ( esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ; poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ; raska & czerny 2000 ) , with the amount of overlap between the two phases controlling the correlations , * hot , optically thin , quasi - spherical flow with cold cloudlets inside ( rees 1987 ; kuncic , celotti & rees 1997 ) , with the cloudlets filling factor controlling the correlations , * spherical accretion of cold clouds onto a central x  ray source ( collin - souffrin et al .  1996 ; malzac 2001 ) , with the covering factor of the clouds as the control parameter , * mildly relativistic outflow of the x  ray emitting plasma , above a standard accretion disc , with the outflow velocity controlling the correlations ( beloborodov 1999a , b ; janiuk , czerny & ycki 2000 ; malzac , beloborodov , poutanen 2001 ) , * hot , ionized skin on top of the accreting disc , due to thermal instability of the x  ray illuminated plasma , with the skin thickness as the control parameter ( raska & czerny 1996 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ; ycki & raska 2001 ) .    also , models for time variability predicting correct psd , time lags and coherence function can be constructed for the two main geometries ( poutanen & fabian 1999 , hereafter pf99 ; bttcher & liang 1999 ; review in poutanen 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , based solely on the limited spectral / temporal data distinguishing between these scenarios appears very difficult , if at all possible ( see e.g.  discussion and application to cyg x-1 in di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ) . employing more sophisticated tools , involving both spectral and temporal properties is clearly required .",
    "the fourier frequency resolved ( @xmath3-resolved hereafter ) energy spectra seem to be a potentially powerful tool to apply to the problem of distinguishing the models .",
    "the @xmath3-resolved spectra are energy spectra in the limited range of fourier frequency and so , roughly speaking , represent spectra at different time scales of variability ( revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov 1999 ; gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 2000a , b ) .",
    "the @xmath3-resolved spectra found from data of x - ray binaries show a number of features and correlations .",
    "most importantly , the @xmath2-@xmath1 correlation is fulfilled by the @xmath3-resolved spectra in the sense that the higher the fourier frequency , the harder the spectrum , and the smaller the amplitude of reflection ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "this result indicates that the same mechanism which is responsible for the correlation on long timescales ( @xmath4 sec @xmath5@xmath6 , @xmath7 being the dynamical timescale ) , acts also on much shorter time scales , at least down do @xmath8 sec , the time bin of the revnivtsev et al .  analysis .",
    "this fact provides the motivation for our attempt to connect the spectral and timing models and predict their combined results .",
    "therefore in this paper we consider a simple combination of the model of pf99 , with the structure of illuminated accretion discs in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the former is the most complete x  ray emission model so far , since it addresses both the spectral and timing properties of comptonization emission .",
    "the latter naturally predicts the appearance of a hot , ionized skin on top of the disc ( raska & czerny 1996 ; nayakshin et al .",
    "2000 ) , as a result of the thermal instability of the x - ray irradiated plasma ( field 1965 ; krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) .",
    "the ionized skin reduces the effectiveness of reprocessing and thermalization of the hard x  rays .",
    "the flux of soft photons is reduced , which may lead to a harder continuum spectrum .",
    "if the ionized skin is thickest close to the black hole ( nayakshin 2000 ; ycki & raska 2001 ) , then the hardest spectra , with lowest reflection amplitude are expected to originate there .",
    "if the short time scale ( high fourier frequency , @xmath3 ) flares originate close to the black hole , then one may expect the high-@xmath3 spectra to be harder , and show less reflection compared to low-@xmath3 spectra , precisely as observed from accreting black hole binaries .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we define the model , in section  [ sec : test ] we perform some test computations to gain deeper insight into the properties of frequency - resolved spectra , section  [ sec : runs ] contains results of full model calculations and their comparison with data ; the results are discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we envision that the x  rays are produced in flares occurring above an accretion disc .",
    "the variability part of our model is therefore identical to that of pf99 ( see also stern & svensson 1996 ) , so only a brief description is given here for completeness . there is a number of spontaneous flares , @xmath9 per second , each of which can give rise to an avalanche of stimulated flares . the number of stimulated flares is drawn from a poissonian distribution with the mean @xmath10 .",
    "each stimulated flare is delayed from the stimulating flare by an interval @xmath11 , drawn from a poissonian distribution of mean @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time scale of the stimulating flare while @xmath14 is a parameter .",
    "the time scales of all flares are drawn according to a power law probability distribution @xmath15 between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "as in pf99 all flares have the same profile , which describes the heating of electrons as a function of time , @xmath18 . here , @xmath19 is the compactness parameter , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the luminosity and @xmath22 is the radius of a flare .",
    "the flare profile turns out to be decisive for the obtained dependence of energy spectra on fourier frequency , therefore we will employ two of prescriptions :    * the function used by pf99 , @xmath23 * a double exponential function defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the rise and decline time scales and @xmath27 ( maccarone , coppi & poutanen 2000 ) .",
    "the functions are normalized to give an assumed value of peak compactness , @xmath28 , for which we adopt @xmath29 .",
    "the flare decline time scale is assumed @xmath30 .",
    "the flux of soft photons through the flare is given as @xmath31 ( pf99 ) , where the second term describes the feedback due to reprocessing of the hard x  rays . here",

    "the crucial extension of the pf99 model which needs to be made here is to relate the time scale of a flare to its radial location on the accretion disc .",
    "we will consider two cases :    1 .",
    "there is a unique correspondence between the time scale of an individual flare ( both spontaneous and stimulated ) and its location on the disc .",
    "since we do not assume any correlation between time scales of a stimulating and stimulated flare , this means that spatial locations of flares within an avalanche are not correlated .",
    "2 .   the unique correspondence between @xmath37 and @xmath38 holds for spontaneous flares , while all flares stimulated by a given spontaneous flare occur at the location of the latter ( merloni & fabian 2001 ) .",
    "the essential assumption here is that there is at least partial correspondence between flare s time scale and its radial position . to quantify the discussion",
    "we assume that the flare time scale has the same radial dependence as the inverse of the keplerian frequency , @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the shortest flare time scale is assumed to correspond to the marginally stable orbit at @xmath40 .",
    "this gives @xmath41 one consequence of such assumption is the existence of the maximum radius of the flares - covered disc , @xmath42 .",
    "some other parameters of the model need to be considered as functions of radius , too .",
    "the compactness @xmath43 ( see equation 1 in pf99 ) is a function of radius , since both the internal disc emission , @xmath44 , and the flare s radius , @xmath22 may in general be functions of radius . for the internal disc emission we adopt the standard , newtonian formula ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fraction of total energy dissipated inside the disc ( @xmath47 dissipated in the active corona ) .",
    "we will assume that the radius of a flare , @xmath22 , is constant with the radial position .",
    "the value of @xmath22 will be derived from global energy budget for the hot plasma : the total , time - integrated luminosity of all flares equals energy dissipation in the hot phase , @xmath48 where the sum is over all flares , @xmath49 is the total accretion luminosity , while @xmath50 is the total time interval . note that the radial dependence of @xmath51 introduces slight overall radial dependence of spectra , since the time evolution of electron temperature depends on the value of @xmath51 .",
    "we assume that the continuum spectrum is due to comptonization of soft photons from the disc and most of these photons come from reprocessing of the hard x  ray flux .",
    "the comptonized spectrum is computed using the thcomp code of zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz ( 1996 ) , based on solution of the kompaneets equation .",
    "this is parameterized by the photon index of the spectrum , @xmath1 and plasma temperature , @xmath52 .",
    "these parameters are computed using formulae from beloborodov ( 1999b ) : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the comptonization parameter and @xmath57 .",
    "we assume @xmath58 ( pf99 ) .      from equation  ( 1 ) of pf99",

    "this is in general a complicated task , requiring solving simultaneously equations of the vertical structure of the disc and the ionized skin ( raska & czerny 1996 ; raska 1999 ; nayakshin et al .  2000 ; ycki & raska 2001 ) .",
    "the computations can not be performed in real time because of the large number of spectra needed .",
    "simulating a 256 sec lightcurve with @xmath65 sec time resolution requires computing more than @xmath66 spectra .",
    "therefore , we use the code of ycki & raska ( 2001 ) to generate a grid of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath63 and @xmath38 . a fitting formula is then used to describe the results , @xmath67 \\over w}\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",

    "the square of @xmath74 in the numerator comes from the fact that the reflected photons have to go twice through the hot skin .",

    "the above prescription for @xmath2 is obviously rather approximate , so we do not attempt to e.g.  reproduce the correct observed amplitude of the reprocessed component . the function @xmath75 describing the dependence of the soft flux from thermalization on @xmath34 ( see eq .",

    "formula ( [ equ : lwrefl ] ) is multiplied by a simple exponential cutoff to mimic the proper shape of the reflected continuum at higher energies .",
    "this rough approximation to the reflected spectrum is sufficient for our purposes , since the spectra only up to @xmath83 kev will be presented , and it is not feasible to use e.g.  the proper angle - dependent functions of magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ) .",
    "the fe line is added to the reprocessed continuum .",
    "its equivalent width ( ew ) is computed as a function of the spectral slope , @xmath1 , based on computations by ycki & czerny ( 1994 ) .",
    "we note a number of simplifications involved in the above treatment of the reprocessing : most importantly , constant @xmath1 was used in computing @xmath34 , while the continuum slope evolves during a flare .",
    "furthermore , in our basic model _ no _ time delay is assumed in computing the reprocessed component , either due to finite light travel time or adjustment of hydrostatic equilibrium ( nayakshin & kazanas 2001 ) .",
    "however , a possible influence of the latter effect on the results will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : delay ] in a very simple approximation .    finally , the @xmath3-resolved spectra are computed according to the prescription given by revnivtsev et al .",

    "before presenting the results of the full model computations let us consider simpler test runs , which turn out to be helpful in understanding the interpretation of the fourier-@xmath3 resolved spectra .",
    "the first , trivial test run is to assume that ( 1 ) there is no spectral evolution during a flare , i.e.  the feedback between the soft and hard x  rays is switched off , and ( 2 ) all flares have the same spectra ( no radial dependence of any of the parameters ) .",
    "the reprocessed component is not computed .",
    "all frequency - resolved spectra are then expected to be the same and equal to the assumed spectrum , as is indeed the case in our computations .",
    "second , we set up a run with an artificial dependence of spectrum on the flare time scale , @xmath37 , but still no spectral evolution during flares .",
    "specifically , we assume a power law @xmath99 function such , that the shortest flares ( i.e.  located at @xmath100 ) have hard spectra , @xmath101 , while the longest ones ( at @xmath102 ) have @xmath103 . the reprocessed component is not computed .",
    "result plotted in figure  [ fig : testffres]a show , as expected , the high frequency spectra are hard and the spectra soften with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "below @xmath104 hz , where psd is formed by flares avalanches , the slope of the energy spectra is no longer dependent on @xmath3 .",
    "third , we introduce spectral evolution during flares , but neither the radial dependences nor reprocessing .",
    "the model is thus equivalent to that of pf99 , with the same values of all parameters , @xmath105 ; @xmath106 ; @xmath107 ; @xmath108 ; @xmath109 ms ; @xmath110 s , @xmath111 , @xmath112 . the frequency - resolved spectra",

    "[ equ : dbleexp ] ) .",
    "the dependencies on @xmath3 are opposite for the two profiles : for the pf99 profile the spectra are harder at _ lower _ frequencies , while the opposite is true for the double exponential profile .",
    "all @xmath3-resolved spectra are identical in the frequency range where individual flares form the psd , i.e.  @xmath113 hz ( see fig .",
    "2b in pf99 ) , the latter value being related to @xmath17 and chosen to match the break in observed psd .",
    "the opposite behaviour of energy spectra for @xmath114 hz is related to differences in spectral evolution during a flare for the two profiles . for the pf99 profile",
    "the rise time at soft x - rays is shorter than at hard x - rays ( see fig .",
    "1b in pf99 ) , therefore the soft x - ray psd breaks at higher frequency than the hard x - ray psd .",
    "the high-@xmath3 energy spectra are thus softer .",
    "the opposite is true for the double exponential profile : the soft x - ray rise time is longer here , the soft x - ray psd breaks at lower @xmath3 , and the higher-@xmath3 energy spectra are harder .",
    "the main qualitative results of the computations with the hot skin can actually be easily predicted . assuming @xmath115 and @xmath116 we obtain that the maximum illuminating flux is independent of radius . since the gravity decreases with radius , the thickness of the hot skin will _ increase _ with radius .",
    "this is opposite to what is observed in usual computations ( nayakshin 2000 ; ycki & raska 2001 ) , where the illuminating flux is proportional to the locally dissipated gravitational energy .",
    "moreover , the total luminosity of a flare is proportional to its time scale , @xmath117 for both flare profiles . thus the emitted radiation is dominated by emission from outer radii ( recall that by assumption @xmath118 ) of the emitting region , i.e.  where the hot skin is thickest .      in our basic model",

    "the comptonized continuum originating at larger distances is then indeed harder .",
    "spectral index , @xmath1 , is smaller than in the test run ( for the same values of other parameters ) because of the reduction of the soft reprocessed flux due to the hot skin .",
    "the @xmath3-resolved spectra are presented in figure  [ fig : full1]b .",
    "the high frequency , @xmath125 ( @xmath126 hz ) , spectra are now split due to the radial dependence of @xmath34 ( compare with fig .  [",

    "so the hardening above @xmath128 kev is more significant ) .",
    "the @xmath2@xmath1 correlation holds for these high fourier frequencies , as shown in figure  [ fig : full1]c .",

    "the @xmath1-spectrum thus describes the current distribution of the spectral index , analogously to the energy spectrum describing the distribution of energy . obviously , since @xmath1 has a well defined value at each time step , its distribution is strictly speaking a dirac @xmath132-function .",

    "the @xmath3-resolved spectra are harder when @xmath3 increases ( revnivtsev et al .  1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "this holds best for the frequency range @xmath134@xmath135 hz , where both single flares and flares avalanches form the psd .",
    "the @xmath136 dependence seems to flatten both at low , @xmath137 hz , and high , @xmath138 hz , frequencies ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "similar conclusion , that the shots contributing to low-@xmath3 part of psd have softer spectra than average , was reached by negoro , kitamoto & mineshige ( 2001 ) , using the technique of superposed shots profile .",
    "the ew of the fe line decreases monotonically with @xmath3 for @xmath139 hz , being @xmath140constant below that frequency ( revnivtsev et al .  1999 , 2001 ) .",

    "1999 ) .        from the discussion above it is clear that the opposite behaviour of comptonized spectra with fourier frequency to that observed is partly due to the peak flares luminosity being constant with radius .",
    "additionaly , the increase of luminosity with radius is obviously in disagreement with the radial dependence of the gravitational energy release , @xmath146 .",
    "it might therefore seem appropriate to modify the @xmath147 dependence assuming it should decrease with radius , so that the longer flares have lower peak luminosities .",
    "however , any such modification will affect the psd .",
    "this is because the psd is related to the distribution of the number of events ( individual flares and avalanches ) over their ( total ) luminosity .",

    "this is because , adjusting the normalization of @xmath147 so that the mean luminosity - weighted @xmath162 , the simple time average of @xmath19 is much smaller than before .",
    "this requires larger sizes of flares , @xmath22 , in order for the total luminosity to remain constant .",
    "hence , the maximum illuminating flux , which scales as @xmath163 ( assuming the height of maximum dissipation @xmath164 ) , is smaller than in the model with @xmath116 . as a consequence",
    ", no correlations is obtained between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath3-resolved spectra in this model show slight hardening with @xmath3 , due to flare spectral evolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : testffres]c ) , but the reprocessed component is constant with @xmath3 .",
    "the fourier frequency dependence of the spectra becomes less significant , when the assumption is made that the spatial positions of all stimulated flares coincide with that of their stimulating flare ( sec  [ sec : radial ] ; the distribution of time scales @xmath165 is retained for all flares ) .",
    "this is to be expected , since the correspondence of variability time scale",
    "( i.e.  @xmath3 ) and physical conditions ( i.e.  @xmath38 ) is no longer unique .",
    "in particular , the high-@xmath3 spectra are almost identical in this case , while the lower-@xmath3 ones are somewhat softer compared to results of the basic model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ffresvar ] ) .",
    "the ew of the line shows no frequency dependence being approximately constant at @xmath166 ev .",
    "the properties of the reprocessed component may not be always given by the instanteneous illuminating flux , as the accretion disc needs to re - adjust to the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium with changed x ",
    "ray radiation pressure and the compton temperature ( nayakshin & kazanas 2001 ) .",
    "parameters of the hot skin are thus not given by the instantaneous flux , if the flux fluctuates rapidly .",
    "the thickness of the hot skin re - adjusts on the dynamical time scale @xmath167 , while its temperature on the thermal time scale , which is usually much shorter ( nayakshin & kazanas 2001 ) .",
    "this effect may influence our results , since the response time is approximately equal the flare time scale , @xmath168 .",
    "since proper computations of time - dependent response of an accretion disc to changing illumination are not possible at present , we model here the response in a rather approximate way , motivated by the results of nayakshin & kazanas ( 2001 ) .",
    "we simply assume that for each flare @xmath169 is determined by illumination flux at an eariler time @xmath170 , i.e.  the complex response of reflection is approximated as a simple time shift .",
    "in particular , at the beginning of a flare , for @xmath171 , there is no hot skin and the reprocessed component is produced with amplitude 1 .",
    "the radial dependence of @xmath34 in this model is qualitatively the same as in the basic model , i.e.  @xmath34 increases with @xmath38 .",
    "the values of @xmath172 are now smaller , though , since by assumption @xmath34 is fixed at zero for a certain time @xmath173 during each flare .",
    "the radial dependence of @xmath1 is somewhat weaker but the overall trends are virtually the same as in our basic model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : full1]b ) .",
    "with increasing @xmath3 the spectra become harder first , then , above @xmath104 hz , they soften .",
    "the ew of the line has the same @xmath3-dependence except for a slight overall increase by 1520 ev .",
    "there results are not unexpected since the delay is relatively short compared to the duration of a flare . with increasing delay ,",
    "still the same qualitative results are obtained .",
    "the influence of the hot skin becomes less significant but the radial trends are the same , if the delay time scale is related to the flare time scale . in the limit of a very long delay",
    "the presence of the hot skin becomes unimportant , and the model reduces to the original model of pf99 .",
    "a number of geometrical / physical models of accretion onto compact sources can be constructed , if only a part of the available information on x - ray emission is used . supplementing the usually employed energy spectral analysis with time variability and , in particular , correlated spectral ",
    "timing behaviour , one can attempt to distinguish between the models . in this paper predictions for fourier - resolved spectroscopy",
    "are presented for the model of magnetic flares avalanches ( pf99 ) above an accretion disc with hot ionized skin .",
    "the basic model formulated by pf99 is quite successful in explaining both energy spectra and a number of timing characteristics : psd , hard x  ray time lags and the coherence function . with the suitably chosen flare profile ( e.g.  a double exponential with @xmath174 ) ,",
    "the auto- and cross - correlation function can also be reproduced ( maccarone et al .",
    "the dependence of energy spectra on fourier frequency , resulting from the spectral evolution during flares alone , is in agreement with observations for e.g.  the double exponential flare profile , but not for the profile assumed in pf99 ( sec  [ sec : test ] ) .",
    "our extension of the pf99 model is to assume that there exists at least partial correspondence between location of a flare and its time scale .",
    "the simplest assumption about such correspondence is that it follows from projecting the flares time scales onto the ( inverse of ) keplerian frequency .",
    "the shortest flares are then located near the inner radius of the disc , the longer a flare the farther away it is located .",
    "now , in the basic model both the peak heating rate ( compactness parameter ) and flare diameter are independent of radius , which means that the peak flux of the disc illuminating x ",
    "rays is independent of radius , too .",
    "since the vertical component of gravity decreases with radius ( @xmath175 ) , the thickness of the hot ionized skin _ increases _ with radius .",
    "the fast flares , located where the hot skin is thinest , have then softer spectra than the slower flares located where the thick hot skin decreases the effectiveness of thermalization of x  rays and , consequently , the flux of soft photons for comptonization . as a result , the energy spectra corresponding to high fourier frequencies are _",
    "softer _ than the lower @xmath3 spectra , for the frequency where the properties of individual flares determine the psd , @xmath176 , where @xmath1773 hz in black hole binaries .",
    "this is opposite to the observed trends , which show steady hardening of the spectra with increasing fourier frequency , at least up to @xmath178 hz ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "1999 ) .    as a consequence , the properties of the reprocessed component in the presented model , in particular the fe line",
    ", do not agree with the observed trends , either . at high @xmath176 the reflection amplitude and ew of the line increase sharply with @xmath3 , as a consequence of the inwards  decreasing thickness of the hot skin . at low @xmath142 hz the model @xmath2 and ew of the line are roughly constant , however @xmath2 is significantly less than 1 and , consequently , ew is smaller than the corresponding value of @xmath0 ev .",
    "this is contrary to the observed @xmath145 and ew@xmath144 ev at these low frequencies .",
    "these results hold true even when some of the model assumptions are modified ( sec .",
    "[ sec : varia ] ) .",
    "none of the modifications made : the different radial distribution of the stimulated flares , radial dependence of the peak flare luminosity or the delayed response of reflection , changed the trends of spectral parameters with fourier frequency .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the perhaps most obvious of the above modifications ",
    "the radial distribution of flares peak luminosity such that the total flares luminosity decreases with radius  not only does not help to reproduce the observed ew@xmath133 and @xmath136 , but it also changes the psd so that it no longer agrees with observations .",
    "it remains to be seen whether a more complex formulation of the model is possible , which would simultaneously predict the correct psd and thickness of the hot skin decreasing with radius .",
    "the same technique of analysis of @xmath3-resolved spectra can be applied to other models mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] . in the dynamic corona model with bulk outflow of the plasma , the plasma velocity , @xmath179 , is the control parameter of the @xmath2@xmath1 correlation ( beloborodov 1999a , b ) .",
    "the observed @xmath3-dependence of the energy spectra would require higher @xmath179 closer to the center .",
    "this is indeed expected , if the x - ray luminosity scales with local gravitational energy dissipation .",
    "however , if the x  ray emission is determined from the properties of the flares , assuming their radial distribution as adopted in this paper ( sec .  [ sec : radial ] , eq .",
    "[ equ : rvstau ] ) , then stronger x  ray emission is expected from larger distances , exactly as in the computations of the hot skin model .",
    "it is then likely that @xmath179 will increase with radius , analogously to the result that the thickness of the hot skin increases with radius in our model .",
    "the result for the @xmath3-resolved spectra will then be the same as for the model with hot skin . in the alternative geometry ( the optically thick flow distrupted at certain radius and replaced with some form of hot optically thin flow ) , the model of bttcher & liang ( 1999 ) can be used to compute the @xmath3-resolved spectra .",
    "alternatively , the idea of kotov , churazov & gilfanov ( 2001 ; see also nowak et al .",
    "1999 ) , that the x  ray emitting perturbations are propagating inwards , if developed further into a more physical model , could be used to predict the @xmath3-resolved spectra .",
    "* fourier - resolved x  ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for discriminating various models of accretion . *",
    "the model of ( avalanches of ) magnetic flares , radially distributed above an accretion disc with hot ionized skin , predicts dependencies of various spectral parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ew of the fe line ) on fourier frequency opposite to those observed .",
