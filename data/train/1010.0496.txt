    "in the last decade , we have obtained many valuable new insights into flavour physics and cp violation through the interplay between theory and the data from the @xmath0 factories and the tevatron .",
    "the lessons from the data collected so far is that the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is the dominant source of flavour and cp violation .",
    "new effects could not yet be established , although there are potential signals which are still not conclusive .",
    "the implications for the structure of new physics ( np ) is that we may actually have to deal with a large characteristic np scale @xmath4 , i.e.  a scale that is not just @xmath5 , or / and that symmetries prevent large np effects in flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes , where the most prominent example is  minimal flavour violation \" ( mfv ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that mfv is still far from being experimentally established , and that there are various non - mfv scenarios with room for sizable np effects .",
    "prominent examples are supersymmetry , models with a 4th generation , warped extra dimensions , or @xmath6 models . nevertheless , we have to be prepared to deal with smallish np effects in flavour probes .",
    "the key problem in the use of quark - flavour physics as a probe of np is related to the impact of strong interactions , leading to process - dependent , non - perturbative  hadronic \" parameters in the corresponding calculations .",
    "a closer look shows that the @xmath0-meson system is actually a particularly promising probe : we have simplifications thanks to the large @xmath7-quark mass @xmath8 , there are strategies to determine hadronic parameters from data with the help of flavour - symmetry arguments , and there are tests of sm relations that could be spoiled by np .",
    "there are two attractive ways for np to manifest itself in @xmath0 decays : contributions at the decay amplitude level to rare ( fcnc ) processes , and through contributions to @xmath9@xmath10 mixing ( @xmath11 ) .    in the following discussion",
    ", we shall focus on two topics : in section  [ sec : bsmumu ] , we have a closer look at the rare decay @xmath2 , with a focus on a new strategy for the branching ratio measurement proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , while we focus in section  [ sec : bspsiphi ] on the cp violation in @xmath3 , having in particular a critical look at the picture emerging in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : other ] , we sketch other interesting @xmath0 decays , and give a brief outlook in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the decay @xmath2 originates from @xmath13 penguins and box diagrams in the sm , and the corresponding low - energy effective hamiltonian takes the following form @xcite : @xmath14}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times v_{tb}^\\ast v_{ts } \\eta_y y_0(x_t)(\\bar b s)_{\\rm v - a}(\\bar\\mu\\mu)_{\\rm v - a } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the qed coupling , @xmath16 is the weinberg angle , @xmath17 describes short - distance qcd corrections , and @xmath18 is an",
    " inami  lim function \" . concerning the hadronic sector , only @xmath19 , i.e.  the @xmath1 decay constant @xmath20 , enters so that the @xmath2 channel belongs to the cleanest rare @xmath0 decays . using the data for the mass difference @xmath21 to trade @xmath20 into the bag parameter @xmath22 yields @xmath23 which holds in mfv models , and gives for the sm @xmath24 where the error is fully dominated by @xmath22 coming from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "as is well known , this branching ratio may be significantly enhanced through np ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the present 95% c.l .",
    "upper bounds from cdf and 0 are still about one order of magnitude above the sm prediction in ( [ br - sm ] ) and read as @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the measurement of @xmath27 at lhcb will rely on normalization channels such as @xmath28 , @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 : @xmath31 where the @xmath32 are total detector efficiencies and the @xmath33 denote the observed numbers of events .",
    "the @xmath34 are fragmentation functions , which describe the probability that a @xmath7 quark fragments in a @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "a closer look shows that @xmath37 is actually the major source of uncertainty , limiting the ability to detect a @xmath38 deviation from the sm at lhcb to @xmath39 ( assuming an uncertainty of @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath42 decays.,title=\"fig:\",width=134 ]   and @xmath42 decays.,title=\"fig:\",width=134 ]    since the determinations of @xmath41 are not sufficient to meet the high precision at lhcb , a new strategy to measure this quantity at lhcb was proposed in ref .",
    "the starting point is @xmath43 knowing the ratio of the branching ratios , we could obviously extract @xmath41 experimentally . in order to implement this feature in practice , the @xmath44 and @xmath45 decays have to satisfy the following requirements :    * the ratio of their branching ratios must be easy to measure at lhcb ; * the decays must be robust with respect to the impact of np contributions ; * the ratio of their brs must be theoretically well understood within the sm .    these requirements guide us to the @xmath46 and @xmath47 channels , which receive only contributions from colour - allowed tree - diagram - like topologies , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] .",
    "their hadronic amplitudes are related to each other by the @xmath48-spin symmetry of strong interactions , and the decays are known as prime examples of decays where  factorization \" is expected to hold : @xmath49 this feature could be put on a rigorous theoretical basis in the heavy - quark limit @xcite . in qcd factorization , @xmath50 is found as a quasi - universal quantity @xmath51 with very small process - dependent  non - factorizable \" corrections @xcite .",
    "so far , this interesting feature did not have any practical application .",
    "however , we can actually use these decays for the determination of @xmath41 at lhcb . on the one hand",
    ", we have @xmath52 ^ 2\\left|\\frac{a_1(d_s\\pi)}{a_1(d_dk)}\\right|^2,\\label{eq - rat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the ratio of the number of signal events observed in the experiment is given by @xmath53 consequently , we obtain @xmath54,\\ ] ] with @xmath55 ^ 2.\\ ] ]    the @xmath42 and @xmath56 decays can be exclusively reconstructed with the help of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 transitions , respectively . since both channels are selected with an identical flavour final state containing the four charged hadrons @xmath59 , the uncertainty on @xmath60 is small . using a toy monte carlo simulation to generate a @xmath61  fb@xmath62 sample yields about 5500 @xmath42 and 1100 @xmath56 events , resulting in an error of @xmath63 for @xmath64 . here",
    "the dominant uncertainty comes from @xmath65 .",
    "extrapolating to @xmath66  fb@xmath62 , which corresponds to the end of 2011 , the statistical uncertainty becomes essentially negligible so that the total uncertainty is reduced to @xmath67 .",
    "concerning the theoretical uncertainties , we have to deal with non - factorizable @xmath48-spin - breaking effects , which are described by @xmath68 here @xmath69 is associated with non - universal , i.e.  process - dependent , non - factorizable contributions , which can not be calculated reliably .",
    "however , they arise as power corrections to the heavy - quark limit , i.e.  they are suppressed by at least one power of @xmath70 , and are  in the decays at hand ",
    "numerically expected at the few percent level @xcite . moreover , since we are only sensitive to an @xmath71-breaking difference , @xmath72 is conservatively expected to be at most a few percent . in this context , it is important to emphasize that we can also experimentally test factorization , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the major uncertainty affecting ( [ fs - det ] ) is hence the form - factor ratio @xmath73 , where @xmath48-spin - breaking corrections arise from @xmath74 and @xmath75 spectator - quark effects .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath76 form factors have so far received only small theoretical attention . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such effects were explored using heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory , while qcd sum - rule techniques were applied in ref .",
    "@xcite . the numerical value given in the latter paper yields @xmath77 .",
    "if we assume @xmath78 ( as the radius of the @xmath79 is smaller than that of the @xmath80 ) , we obtain the following lower bound @xmath81 which offers an interesting probe for np . in order to match experiment ,",
    "it is sufficient to calculate the @xmath48-spin - breaking corrections to @xmath82 with non - perturbative methods , such as lattice qcd , at the level of 20% , which should be feasible soon .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : np ] , we illustrate the np discovery potential of the @xmath2 channel at lhcb resulting from the strategy proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we show the smallest value of @xmath27 that allows the detection of a @xmath38 deviation from the sm as a function of the luminosity at lhcb ( at the nominal beam energy of 14 tev ) .",
    "the figure on the left - hand side shows the low - luminosity regime , whereas the one on the right - hand side illustrates the asymptotic behaviour . the plot on the right - hand shows that we obtain a np discovery potential about twice as large as the present lhcb expectation  @xcite ( upper horizontal line ) enabling a possible discovery of np down to @xmath83 ( lower horizontal line ) .",
    "in addition to the increased sensitivity in the regime of low branching ratios , even for large values close to the current cdf exclusion limit the significance of a possible np discovery would be increased .",
    "thanks to the decrease of the systematical uncertainty , lhcb will be able to fully exploit the statistical improvement , taking full advantage of the accumulated lhcb data up to 10  fb@xmath62 , which corresponds to five years of nominal lhcb data taking .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is not only crucial for the measurement of @xmath84 but enters the measurement of any @xmath1 branching ratio at lhcb .",
    "the @xmath3 channel is the @xmath1-meson counterpart of the @xmath86 decay .",
    "np may well manifest itself in cp - violating phenomena in @xmath3 through contributions to @xmath87@xmath88 mixing , yielding a mixing phase @xmath89 different from the doubly cabibbo - suppressed sm value @xmath90 ; since the final state of @xmath3 is an admixture of cp - even and cp - odd eigenstates , a time - dependent angular analysis is required to search for np effects @xcite .",
    "the most recent compilation of the corresponding results by the cdf and 0 collaborations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , the situation is not conclusive , though the cdf and 0 analyses are consistent with each other . while cdf finds @xmath91\\sim-30^\\circ \\ , \\lor \\ , [ -177.6^\\circ,-123.8^\\circ]\\sim-150^\\circ$ ] ( 68% c.l . ) , 0 gives a best fit value around @xmath92 , taking also information from the dimuon charge asymmetry and the measured @xmath93 branching ratio into account .",
    "the experimental prospects for the analysis of @xmath3 at lhcb are very promising . with @xmath94  fb@xmath62 ,",
    "an experimental uncertainty of @xmath95 can be achieved , which could be reduced at an lhcb upgrade with an integrated luminosity of 100@xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "on @xmath98 for various values of @xmath99 @xcite . ]",
    "so far , the sm penguin effects were fully neglected in the analysis of the cp violation in the @xmath3 channel : @xmath100,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 describes the ratio of penguin to tree contributions for a given final - state configuration @xmath102 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed discussion of their impact was given , proposing also a strategy to control these penguin effects through data .",
    "the penguin contributions modify the expression for the mixing - induced cp violation @xmath103 as follows : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the cp eigenvalue of the final - state configuration , @xmath106 is a direct cp asymmetry ( which can be measured ) , and @xmath107 is a hadronic phase shift caused by the penguin contributions , which can be expressed in terms of @xmath98 and @xmath99 as given in ref .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath108 does not depend on the value of @xmath89 itself . in fig .",
    "[ fig : delphi ] , we show the resulting dependence of @xmath108 on the penguin parameter @xmath98 for various values of @xmath99 . we observe that @xmath107 is of the same size as @xmath109 for @xmath110 . as far as the direct cp asymmetry is concerned , we have @xmath111 for @xmath112 and values of @xmath113 as large as @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "as we expect @xmath115 , the shift of @xmath89 is expected to be negative as well , i.e.  it would interfere constructively with @xmath109 .",
    "these features are fully supported by a recent analysis of the @xmath116 channel @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "consequently , it is important to get a handle on the penguin effects in the @xmath85 decay .",
    "this can be done by means of the @xmath117 mode , which has the following sm amplitude : @xmath118 it should be stressed that the penguin term is here _ not _ doubly cabibbo - suppressed .",
    "if we use the @xmath71 flavour symmetry and neglect penguin annihilation and exchange amplitudes ( which can be probed through @xmath119 ) , we have @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in the summer of 2010",
    ", cdf has announced the observation of the @xmath117 mode , with a branching ratio at the @xmath122 level @xcite . moreover ,",
    "also the @xmath123 decay was observed , which allows us to control the penguin effects discussed above in the measurement of @xmath124 through @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the determination of the penguin parameters from the observables of the angular distribution of @xmath117 is presented in ref .",
    "let us here just emphasize that the favoured negative sign of @xmath125 implies a constructive interference with @xmath126 in ( [ am ] ) . for values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( consistent with the picture following from current @xmath116 data @xcite ) , we get a phase shift of @xmath129 , which yields @xmath130 , i.e.   about twice the naive sm value .",
    "consequently , without a control of the penguin effects , this sm effect would be misinterpreted as a @xmath131 np effect with @xmath132 at lhcb , and about @xmath133 at an upgrade with @xmath134 .",
    "should we find large mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath3 , such as @xmath135 , we would have an immediate and unambiguous signal of np . on the other hand , should we find @xmath136 , more theoretical and experimental work would be needed in order to settle the picture .",
    "also in the case of @xmath86 , we have to control the penguin effects in order to match the experimental precision at lhcb @xcite .",
    "there is much more interesting physics left for the @xmath0-decay studies at lhcb .",
    "an important line of research is given by precision measurements of the angle @xmath137 of the unitarity triangle .",
    "this quantity can be determined through pure  tree \" decays on the one hand ( such as @xmath138 ) , and through decays with penguin contributions on the other hand ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 system ) .",
    "the central question is whether we will get values of @xmath137 that are consistent with one another @xcite .",
    "another key topic is given by the study of rare decays , complementing the leptonic @xmath2 ( and its even stronger suppressed partner @xmath141 ) channel discussed above .",
    "the semileptonic decays @xmath142 , @xmath143 offer another interesting probe for np . here",
    "the hadronic sector involves quark - current form factors , and the goal is to find and measure observables that are particularly robust with respect to the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "the prime example is the 0-crossing of the forward ",
    "backward asymmetry ; other observables were recently proposed ( see ref .",
    "there are also non - leptonic rare decays that originate only from loop processes .",
    "particularly interesting are cp - violating asymmetries in @xmath144 and similar modes . in order to deal with hadronic corrections ,",
    "flavour symmetries offer strategies to control them through experimental data . also here",
    "the key question is whether we will encounter discrepancies with respect to the sm picture .",
    "studies of charm physics offer another line of research . while fcncs in the @xmath0 system are sensitive to new effects in the up sector , charm physics probes the down sector , i.e.  we have @xmath7 , @xmath75 , @xmath74 quarks running in the sm loops .",
    "such a process is @xmath145@xmath146 mixing , which is seen in the ball park of the sm .",
    "np could be hiding there , but is obscured through long - distance qcd effects . in order to search for np , cp - violating effects , which are tiny in the sm but may be enhanced through np contributions , are most promising .",
    "last but not least , we can also search for lepton flavour violation through @xmath147 and @xmath148 decays , which are forbidden in the sm but may arise in np scenarios .",
    "these studies complement other searches by means of @xmath149 , @xmath150 or @xmath151 processes .",
    "we are currently moving towards new frontiers in precision @xmath0 physics thanks to the start - up of the lhcb experiment .",
    "the last decade has led to various interesting results , showing  among many other insights  that the ckm matrix is the dominant source of flavour and cp violation .",
    "potential signals of new phenomena were also seen , although the situation is still not conclusive .",
    "flavour physics takes part in the big scientific adventure of this decade , which is the lhc .",
    "specific np scenarios still leave room for sizable effects .",
    "particularly promising channels to find first signals at lhcb ( and the lhc ) are @xmath12 and @xmath3 .    in view of the new territory we are about to enter now",
    ", the sm phenomena have to be critically reviewed and strategies to control the corresponding hadronic uncertainties to be further developed and refined . concerning the search for np",
    ", the patterns in specific scenarios should be further explored . in particular correlations between different observables should play a key role in revealing the structure of np , should we actually see footprints of physics beyond the sm .",
    "moreover , synergies with the high-@xmath152 physics at atlas and cms should be further studied and exploited .",
