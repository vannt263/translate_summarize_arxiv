    "one of the most typical low - temperature properties of glasses is the existence of two - level systems ( tls s ) which determine at low temperatures , typically below a few kelvin , and frequencies less than 1  ghz , phenomena such as specific heat , thermal conductivity , ultrasonic and microwave absorption and many others ( such as the echo , etc)@xcite .",
    "another remarkable universal property of almost all glasses is the boson peak in the low frequency inelastic scattering , proportional to the reduced density of the vibrational states @xmath0 .",
    "compared to the tls s it is observed at much higher frequencies , between 0.5 and 2 thz , and persists to higher temperatures , sometimes up to the glass transition temperature @xmath12 . usually these two important glassy features are considered separately and no definite connection between them has been established so far .    the purpose of the present paper is to propose a physical picture in which these two seemingly different phenomena are closely interrelated .",
    "we will show that the formation of the boson peak in the reduced vibrational density of states ( dos ) inevitably leads to the creation of two - level systems ( and vice versa ) .",
    "a mechanism of the boson peak formation , implying also the formation of tls s was proposed in our recent papers  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was based on the phenomenon of _ vibrational instability _ of weakly interacting harmonic oscillators ( ho s ) .",
    "the instability takes place in the low frequency region , @xmath13 , below some characteristic frequency @xmath9 which is proportional to the interaction strength @xmath6 . changing the interaction strength one can vary the width of the instability region , the position of the boson peak and the number of tls s .",
    "the weakness of the interaction @xmath6 implies that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is of the order of debye frequency .",
    "thus the vibrational instability occurs far below the debye frequency @xmath2 and has little influence on the high frequency vibrations .",
    "the low - frequency harmonic oscillators we are speaking about are realized in glasses as _ quasi - local _ vibrations ( qlv ) which can be understood as _",
    "local _ low frequency vibrations bilinearly coupled to the sound waves  @xcite .",
    "the existence of quasi - local vibrations in glasses has been confirmed in a number of papers ( see e.g. the literature cited in ref .",
    "the local low frequency vibrations are the cores of the qlv s .",
    "the cores represent collective low frequency vibrations of small groups of atoms  @xcite .",
    "if one plots the potential energy against the amplitude of one of these modes @xcite , one obtains a mode potential , as treated in the soft potential model  @xcite .",
    "the vibrational instability results from the weak interaction @xmath6 of these soft oscillators with high - frequency oscillators ( with @xmath14 ) . as a result of this harmonic instability and the anharmonicity of the glass the initial vibrational density of states",
    "@xmath15 is reconstructed in the low frequency region @xmath16 where instability takes place and shows the _ universal _ boson peak feature .    the microscopic origin of these high frequency oscillators , whose frequencies are much higher than the boson peak one , is not important in this picture .",
    "it has been shown that , in general , the frequency of the sound waves can pass through the ioffe - regel limit near the boson peak frequency  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the higher frequency modes might have a rather complex structure .",
    "they interact with the soft oscillators .",
    "this interaction causes the vibrational instability and hence the boson peak and tls s formation .",
    "the vibrational instability is a rather general phenomenon and occurs in any system of bilinearly coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "it can be considered in a purely harmonic approximation .",
    "for example , a system of two oscillators with masses @xmath17 and frequencies @xmath18 becomes unstable if the interaction @xmath6 between the oscillators exceeds a critical value  @xcite @xmath19 .",
    "if one of two frequencies is small then the critical interaction @xmath20 is also small . in our case",
    "we have such an instability due to the interaction of low and high frequency oscillators .",
    "therefore , we can simplify the picture to treat it analytically . the physical reason for the instability in this case",
    "is the fact that the high frequency modes adiabatically follow the motion of the low - frequency oscillator ( a description of this fact can be given within the _ adiabatic approximation _ ) .",
    "the squared frequency of the soft oscillator is reduced by an amount proportional to the strength of the interaction squared and , therefore , even can turn negative . for the example of two interacting oscillators with frequencies",
    "@xmath21 the new frequency @xmath22 of the low - frequency oscillator is given by  @xcite @xmath23 it is important that it decreases to zero _ linearly _ with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , when @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is the essence of the vibrational instability phenomenon in the general case . as a result , switching on the interaction between the oscillators ,",
    "we shift _ all _ low frequency modes with @xmath27 towards the boundary point @xmath28 and some of them will cross this point ( so that the corresponding @xmath29 turns negative ) .",
    "therefore , in such a case ( if there is no hard gap around zero in the initial density of states , @xmath15 ) we will have a _ constant _ distribution of renormalized @xmath29 around @xmath28 . from",
    "that we immediately get the right wing of the boson peak . indeed , the local anharmonicity does not change this important property of uniform distribution of renormalized @xmath29 around zero .",
    "one can show  @xcite that it restores the mechanical stability of the system by simply _ reflecting _ all the negative @xmath29 values back to the positive @xmath29 range ( like in a mirror but with additional stretching factor of 2 , which is obviously not important , see eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the strength of the anharmonicity itself plays no role in this _",
    "mirror transformation_. now a constant distribution of @xmath29 around zero ( on the positive side ) obviously leads to a universal _ linear law _ for the density of states , @xmath30 in the interval @xmath31 ( independent of the initial dos @xmath15 ) . and in its turn this linear @xmath32 dependence of the reconstructed dos just gives us the right wing of the boson peak , since @xmath33 and this dependence is also universal and independent of the initial dos @xmath15 .",
    "we want to stress that this dos transformation ( due to the phenomenon of vibrational instability ) is rather general and universal since any monotonous `` traffic '' of @xmath29 from positive to negative values ( due to interaction between the oscillators , or due to changing the temperature or pressure , etc . ) always gives a constant distribution of @xmath29 around zero .",
    "therefore , the universal linear dos , @xmath30 , and the corresponding universal right wing of the boson peak , @xmath33 , inevitably emerge as a result of this instability .",
    "if the origin of the right wing of the boson peak looks somehow natural , the left wing of the boson peak appears as a result of the less obvious additional transformation of the linear dos at smaller frequencies .",
    "the point is that when the anharmonicity restores the mechanical stability of the system , single - well potentials describing the unstable soft modes with negative @xmath29 are replaced by double - well ones .",
    "this means that the effective potential energy of the glass in direction of the local soft mode has two minima separated by a rather low barrier .",
    "thus , in this scheme , the two - level systems are created simultaneously with the boson peak due to the same mechanism of vibrational instability .",
    "besides their own high importance ( the tls s physics in glasses and beyond ) these double - well potentials play also an important role in building the left wing of the boson peak .",
    "it can be explained as follows .",
    "due to bilinear interaction between the oscillators , @xmath34 , double - well potentials , with a particle vibrating in one of the wells and therefore having a non - zero average displacement @xmath35 , create random _ static _",
    "forces @xmath36 acting on other oscillators . in a purely harmonic case",
    ", these linear forces would not affect the frequencies ( and linear density of states @xmath30 would not change ) .",
    "however , together with the local anharmonicity the static forces create a universal _ soft gap _ , @xmath37 , in the linear density of states .",
    "this soft gap is a manifestation of the sea - gull singularity  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) predicted in the framework of the soft potential model for glasses .",
    "recently it was shown that @xmath38 behavior of the dos is indeed a universal feature in disordered systems for low frequency bosonic excitations which are not goldstone modes  @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this gap is very transparent . due to anharmonicity",
    "there is always a _ blue shift _ of the soft oscillator frequency under the action of the static force @xmath39 . for small @xmath32",
    "this shift is proportional to @xmath40 and it is anomalously large for small forces .",
    "the density of states in the gap then can be estimated as follows @xmath41 as a result , the random static forces ( together with anharmonicity ) effectively `` push out '' oscillators from the low frequency range to higher frequencies , creating the universal soft gap , @xmath37 .",
    "one can also see this gap in the context of mechanical stability of the system but of another kind .",
    "due to local anharmonicity small frequencies can not survive in the system in the presence of random static forces .",
    "in some sense they are not stable even though random forces can not transform single - well potentials into double - well ones .",
    "the width of the @xmath38-gap is of the order of the boson peak frequency @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the width of the random force distribution @xmath44 .",
    "the boson peak frequency @xmath10 is typically smaller  @xcite than the characteristic frequency @xmath9 determining the width of the vibrational instability region  @xcite @xmath45^{1/3 } .",
    "\\label{xt56}\\ ] ] the strong inequality @xmath46 occurs if @xmath47 i.e. @xmath15 is an increasing function of @xmath32 ( since @xmath1 ) . as a result ,",
    "@xmath37 in the interval @xmath48 .",
    "frequencies higher than @xmath10 are only weakly affected by the static forces .",
    "therefore , the linear dos , @xmath30 ( and the right wing of the boson peak ) which was created in the course of the vibrational instability is conserved in the interval @xmath49 . since at small frequencies",
    "@xmath50 we have the universal @xmath38 gap in the density of states , the left wing of the boson peak takes also the universal form , @xmath51 . as a result in the region of the vibrational instability , @xmath31 , we have a universal behavior of the density of states @xmath52 ( @xmath37 for @xmath48 and @xmath30 for @xmath49 ) with the boson peak feature , independent of the initial dos @xmath15 . at higher frequencies , above @xmath9",
    ", we keep the initial dos @xmath15 almost undistorted .",
    "the boson peak was the main topic of our previous papers  @xcite .",
    "in the present work we shall concentrate on the two - level systems , i.e. the level splittings due to the tunneling through the barriers separating the two minima of the two - well potentials .",
    "but this consideration is not independent of the boson peak since we will see that the main parameters of tls s will be strongly interrelated with the parameters of the boson peak .",
    "therefore , these two universal phenomena should be considered together .    in the standard tunneling model the tls s",
    "are often characterized by the so - called dimensionless tunneling strength @xmath8 , ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the density of states of the tls s , @xmath55 the deformation potential , @xmath56 the mass density of the glass and @xmath57 is the average sound velocity . the experimental value of @xmath8 for different glasses is small and varies in a narrow band between 10@xmath58 and 10@xmath59 . in our theory",
    "such small numerical values for @xmath8 will emerge in a natural way .",
    "several authors  @xcite proposed that the approximate universality and smallness of @xmath8 in glasses may be a consequence of the interaction between the tls s .",
    "roughly speaking the idea was based on a mean - field approximation .",
    "the @xmath60th tls produces at a distance @xmath61 a deformation @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the deformation potential of the _ i_th tls .",
    "as the deformation is inversely proportional to @xmath64 the distribution function of the deformations in a glass is a lorentzian with width @xmath65 proportional to the total concentration @xmath66 of the tls s : @xmath67 the energy @xmath68 ( the interlevel spacing ) of each tls changes under the deformation @xmath69 as @xmath70 and from eq .",
    "( [ sgr5 ] ) one sees that the energies @xmath68 of the tls s are distributed in the interval @xmath71 : @xmath72 for small energies , the density of states @xmath73 is independent of both the energy and the concentration of tls s : @xmath74    this is the result of a purely classical approach . in this approach",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath75 @xmath76 is of order unity rather than of the order of @xmath77 .",
    "this was the main difficulty of the theory outlined in ref s .",
    "however , if one accounts for the quantum nature of tunneling , the situation is improved and the value of @xmath8 is reduced strongly . to explain this on the qualitative level we remind that the energy @xmath78 of a tls consists of two contributions , i. e. the classical asymmetry @xmath79 and the quantum tunneling amplitude @xmath80 : @xmath81 .",
    "so far we have disregarded the latter .    according to the standard tunneling model @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the tunneling parameter , distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath84 .",
    "usually @xmath85 is taken to be about unity .",
    "only tls s with @xmath86 can tunnel during typical experimental times . if @xmath87 , systems with @xmath88 can not tunnel and do not contribute to the observable properties .",
    "therefore , the relative number of tls s participating in the tunneling is proportional to the small number @xmath89 . as a result",
    ", we estimate the dimensionless parameter @xmath8 in glasses as @xmath90 if for example @xmath91 the dimensionless parameter @xmath92 .",
    "thus the smallness of the dimensionless parameter @xmath8 in our theory is related to typically large values of the tunneling parameter @xmath93 ( and to typically high barriers in the system ) .",
    "we will discuss this point in section  [ tls ] .",
    "in the same section we will show that two important parameters , namely @xmath8 for tls s and the characteristic frequency @xmath9 for ho s , marking the onset of the vibrational instability are closely interrelated : @xmath94 here @xmath7 is an important characteristic energy in glasses  @xcite .",
    "typically it is of the order of a few kelvin .",
    "it determines for example the position of the minimum in the reduced specific heat  @xcite , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) and some other properties of glasses above one kelvin  @xcite . for vitreous silica @xmath97k .",
    "in particular it follows from this formula that the larger is the interaction @xmath3 between the oscillators the smaller is the tls s",
    "parameter @xmath8 : @xmath98 . and",
    "as we will see in section  [ tls ] the smaller will be also the density of tunneling states , @xmath99 .",
    "it naturally explains the very old puzzle in the physics of glasses , why the number of two - level systems is so small ( one two - level system for a million of atoms ) .    at a first glance",
    "this interesting result seems to be rather contradicting .",
    "the stronger the interaction @xmath6 between the oscillators , the larger is the width of the vibrational instability region @xmath100 and therefore the higher is the number of double - well potentials created in the course of stabilization of the system due to anharmonicity .",
    "the explanation of this seeming paradox is that majority of the double - well potentials created due to vibrational instability have so high barriers @xmath101 that they can not participate in tunneling at all . as a result",
    "only a very small part of the double - well potentials contributes to the tunneling density of states , @xmath54 .    since the experimental values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are well known for many glasses one can estimate from eq .",
    "( [ a45d ] ) the important characteristic energy @xmath102 which gives the width of the vibrational instability region in glasses @xmath103 for example for a - sio@xmath104 @xmath105 k and @xmath106 giving @xmath107k .",
    "this falls into the boson peak region ( @xmath108k ) . as a result",
    "we see that indeed the boson peak is placed in the vibrational instability range .",
    "to illustrate the idea of a vibrational instability , we consider a cluster containing a low - frequency harmonic oscillator ( ho ) with frequency @xmath109 surrounded by a large number , @xmath110 , of ho s with much higher frequencies @xmath111 of the order of @xmath112 . here",

    "however , it is necessary to stress that in this case the strong scattering takes place only in the vicinity of the boson peak frequency @xmath9 .    at higher frequencies the initial dos @xmath472 and according to eq .",
    "( [ po6 ] ) the resonance phonon mean free path is also constant and independent of frequency",

    "we can extend the regime of strong scattering to well above the boson peak frequency ( up to debye frequency @xmath2 ) only when the initial dos is a linear function of the frequency , @xmath475 and interaction @xmath6 is not too small , @xmath476 ( see eq .",
    "( [ pm5 ] ) ) .",
    "as we already mentioned , we will have a weak resonant scattering of phonons on quasilocal oscillators only when the interaction @xmath6 is sufficiently weak and the initial density of states @xmath15 decreases to zero sufficiently fast with @xmath32 , so that @xmath477",
    ". in such a case the mean free path of the phonons @xmath478 will be much larger than their wave length @xmath83 in the whole frequency range . in this case",
    "phonons are well defined quasiparticles everywhere .",
    "we give here also the relaxation time @xmath479 of a ho with frequency @xmath32 due to the interaction with phonons . from eq .",

    "in our previous papers  @xcite we proposed a mechanism of the boson peak formation .",
    "the essence of the mechanism can be formulated as follows .",
    "a vibrational instability of the weakly interacting qlv s ( stabilized by the anharmonicity ) is responsible for the boson peak in glasses and other disordered systems .",
    "the instability occurs below some frequency @xmath9 proportional to the strength of the interaction @xmath6 between low and high frequency oscillators . whereas anharmonicity is essential in creating the atomic structures supporting the boson peak , the vibrations forming the peak in the inelastic scattering intensity or the reduced density of states are essentially harmonic .",
    "the present paper extends these ideas .",
    "we show that such seemingly unrelated phenomena in glasses ( typical for the glassy state and usually treated by separate unrelated models ) as the formation of the two - level systems and the boson peak in the reduced density of low - frequency vibrational states @xmath0 can be explained by the same physical mechanism , namely the _ vibrational instability _ of weakly interacting soft harmonic vibrations .",
    "these can be seen as localized vibrations with a bilinear interaction with the extended modes , the sound waves .",
    "the resulting exact harmonic eigenmodes are quasilocalized vibrations that have been observed in numerous computer simulations and have been discussed extensively  see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .    the instability , which as in all solids is controlled by the anharmonicity , creates a new stable _ universal _ spectrum of harmonic vibrations with the boson peak feature as well as double - well potentials with a wide distribution of the barriers heights that is determined by the strength of the interaction @xmath6 between the oscillators . depending on the barrier height ( and temperature )",
    "these will lead to tunneling and relaxational transitions . to check for the consistency of our theory we calculated the dimensionless parameter @xmath486 for the two - level systems in glasses which is observed in experiment  @xcite .",
    "the smallness of this parameter is a longstanding puzzle . in our theory",
    "it follows naturally .",
    "the physical reason for small value of the parameter @xmath8 is that only a small fraction of all created tls s can actually tunnel in realistic timescales .",
    "we show that the larger is the interaction @xmath6 between the original harmonic vibrations the smaller is parameter @xmath8 .",
    "it reminds partly the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite though we do not have here the frustrated strong interactions .",
    "we prove that for our simple model weakly interacting oscillators @xmath487 . here",
    "@xmath7 is an important characteristic energy in glasses of the order of a few kelvin .",
    "the value of @xmath8 is independent of the assumed initial dos of ho s @xmath15 and in this sense it is universal .",
    "varying the characteristic energy @xmath7 and interaction @xmath6 ( i.e. the characteristic energy @xmath102 ) for different glasses @xmath8 lies in the interval from @xmath488 to @xmath489 .",
    "however , we want to stress that we are not free in the choice of these two parameters . the energy @xmath7 is well known from experiments on specific heat  @xcite , thermal conductivity  @xcite and heat release  @xcite in glasses . as for the characteristic frequency @xmath9 it should be of the order or larger than the boson peak frequency @xmath10 .    in the unified approach developed in the present paper the densities of tunneling states and of excess vibrational states at the boson peak frequency",
    "are interrelated .",
    "since the experimental values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 are well known for many glasses we can use this formula to get the important energy @xmath490 giving us the onset of the vibrational instability region . for vitreous silica",
    "@xmath491 k falling perfectly into the boson peak range .",
    "the same holds for many other glasses  @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the boson peak is indeed placed inside the vibrational instability range .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results of the present paper and of refs .",
    "@xcite with our earlier paper  @xcite where we also discuss the possible origin of the boson peak . in this paper",
    "we consider low - energy raman scattering in glasses .",
    "as in the present paper and in refs .",
    "@xcite we assume that the scattering and the energy transfer are due to the interaction of the light with the soft potentials in glasses . the density of states of the quasilocalized ho s , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , is proportional to @xmath38 for low frequencies and to @xmath32 for high frequencies .",
    "this behavior qualitatively resembles the one obtained in ref .",
    "however , the phenomenon of vibrational instability was disregarded in  @xcite and the discussion of the boson peak was necessarily somewhat qualitative .",
    "considering the vibrational instability , puts the theory on a more quantitative level and , for instance , allows the determination of the shape of the boson peak .",
    "let us now compare the results of our paper with previously published important class of models of the boson peak  @xcite .",
    "experiment has shown that the boson peak is formed by largely harmonic vibrations .",
    "therefore , in all these models the authors have considered an hamiltonian of the form @xmath492 with randomly distributed quasielastic constants @xmath493 . since",
    "this potential energy is purely harmonic we call all such models of the boson peak _ harmonic random matrix _ ( hrm ) models .",
    "the main difference between the quoted four hrm models is in the different distributions of the quasielastic constants @xmath493 .",
    "if all quasielastic constants are positive , @xmath494 , then the corresponding dynamical matrix ( hessian ) is positive - definite and therefore all the eigenvalues are obviously positive as well , @xmath495 ( @xmath496 ) excluding those zeroes which come from the translational and rotational invariances .",
    "in such a case the system is _ mechanically stable_. as was shown in  @xcite the system remains to be stable even when some ( rather small ) fraction of the quasielastic constants @xmath493 in eq .",
    "( [ 4rs3 ] ) is negative ( and small enough ) .",
    "increasing the fraction of negative @xmath493 ( or their absolute values ) authors have approached the mechanical stability threshold ( when the first negative @xmath29 has appears in the spectrum ) .",
    "the reduced density of states @xmath0 for hamiltonian ( [ 4rs3 ] ) usually has a maximum at some frequency @xmath497 for typical values of @xmath494 .",
    "changing the parameters of the distribution function @xmath498 one can shift this maximum to higher or to low frequencies .",
    "the last case was the main goal of the papers  @xcite .",
    "the biggest red shift of the maximum has been achieved approaching the mechanical stability threshold . in the first two papers",
    "@xcite the original maximum was due to van - hove singularity of the crystalline dos .",
    "atoms in these papers were placed on a perfect cubic lattice . as a result",
    "the boson peak has been ascribed to the lowest van hove singularity shifted due to disorder . in another two papers",
    "@xcite atoms were distributed randomly in 3-d space ( so - called euclidean random matrix models ) and quasielastic constants @xmath493 depend exponentially on the interatomic distances @xmath499",
    ". therefore the distribution function of quasielastic constants in these two cases @xmath500 and has a singularity for @xmath501 . thereby the portion of small @xmath150 was increased compared to gaussian and box distributions used in the papers  @xcite .",
    "obviously the red shift of the original peak in @xmath0 was much more pronounced in these latter two cases  @xcite .",
    "our approach , which continues from our previous papers  @xcite differs essentially in two ways .",
    "first , we postulate that the excess in vibrational modes originates from quasi - localized vibrations .",
    "their existence has been shown in numerous simulations of different types of materials .",
    "such modes can be described as local modes ( cores ) which weakly interact bilinearly with the extended modes ( sound waves ) and thus with each other .",
    "the exact harmonic eigenvectors are of course extended as in hrm models .",
    "secondly , we do not invoke special distributions for the elements of the dynamical matrix to avoid unstable vibrations but , on the contrary , show that the generic instability , when controlled by the anharmonicity which is present in all real systems , automatically gives both the tls and the boson peak ( with a universal shape ) without any further assumptions .",
    "the essence of the mechanism can be formulated as follows .",
    "the randomly distributed weakly interacting qlv become unstable at low frequencies in harmonic approximation .",
    "this is the equivalent to the instability in the general hrm models .",
    "instead of assumptions on distribution functions of interactions @xmath118 we use the always present anharmonicity as the stabilizing factor .",
    "the previous vibrational instability of the weakly interacting qlv s thus becomes responsible for the boson peak and tls s in glasses and other disordered systems . whereas anharmonicity is essential in creating the atomic structures supporting the boson peak , the vibrations forming the peak in the inelastic scattering intensity or the reduced density of states are essentially harmonic . comparing with random matrix models our eq .",
    "( [ potgen ] ) without the anharmonicity term would correspond to the case of the unstable random matrix whereas the result of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) correspond to the stabilized case . and ,",
    "importantly , the anharmonicity strength @xmath352 ( thanks to mirror transformation ) does not enter in the expression for the renormalized frequency .",
    "so , the anharmonicity reconstructs the spectrum but the final result is independent of the strength of anharmonicity .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that the stabilization is not a result of an additional assumption but is a benefit of the vibrational instability + anharmonicity which is haunting the alternative approach .",
    "summarizing briefly we can say that the boson peak in papers  @xcite was obtained by a purely harmonic ansatz inside the mechanically _ stable _ region of their hamiltonians .",
    "the position and the form of the peak depend strongly on the distribution function of quasielastic constants @xmath498 . in our approach",
    "the boson peak is built inside the mechanically _ unstable _ region of the harmonic potential parameters .",
    "therefore , the role of anharmonicity as stabilizing factor is crucial .",
    "but the form of the boson peak appears to be universal and independent of the initial assumptions about interaction @xmath118 or the initial distribution function @xmath15 or of the anharmonicity strengths @xmath502 .",
    "relating tls s and boson peak parameters in our theory we are able to show that the instability crossover frequency @xmath9 given by eq .",
    "( [ s6e4 ] ) lies in the boson peak region . due to",
    "weakness of the interaction @xmath6 the universal reconstruction of the spectrum in our theory takes place in the low frequency range only , leaving high frequency range nearly unchanged .",
    "this is different in the hrm models  @xcite where the whole spectral range is completely reconstructed in the course of the change of the distribution function @xmath498 .    as mentioned before in our theory",
    "the estimate for the dimensionless tunneling strength @xmath8 emerges in a naturally ( see eq .",
    "( [ d8 ] ) ) .",
    "varying the characteristic energy @xmath7 and the interaction strength @xmath6 for different glasses @xmath8 falls into the interval between 10@xmath58 and 10@xmath59 .",
    "we want to mention that other explanations of the smallness of the constant @xmath8 have been proposed .",
    "burin and kagan  @xcite predict a number of universal properties of amorphous solids , including the small values of the tunneling strength @xmath8 , due to a special form of interaction of such defect centers with internal degrees of freedom like the tls s .",
    "it is important that the interaction between such centers falls off with distance @xmath503 as @xmath299 . in this case",
    "effects of correlations between many tls s ( _ dipole gap _ effects ) might be important at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "in our paper we have neglected all such many particle correlation effects between tunneling tls s which could further reduce ( or stabilize ) the value of @xmath8 .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that the @xmath299 law of interaction is valid as far as the effects of retardation play no role . in dielectric glasses these effects",
    "are determined by the sound velocity . at sufficiently large distances",
    "they could play a role that would result in the variation of the interaction law .",
    "we believe that the role of the retardation effects deserves a special investigation .",
    "another important difference between our and burin and kagan approaches is that the parameter @xmath8 in our theory is a quantum mechanical quantity , @xmath504 ( see eq .",
    "( [ tr3 ] ) ) .",
    "it disappears in the classical limit @xmath505 . in other words",
    "the smallness of @xmath8 is directly related to the smallness of the quantum mechanical probability for particles tunneling through high barriers in a glass ( see also eq .",
    "( [ pz3 ] ) ) .",
    "differently , the dipole gap effect is purely classical since it is based on the classical dipole - dipole interaction between tls s .",
    "therefore , it would be very interesting to elucidate which of two mechanisms ( or both ) dominates and is responsible for the small value of parameter @xmath8 in glasses .",
    "in particular it would be very interesting to calculate the relaxation times for many particle correlations effects to build the dipole gap .",
    "an analysis of the low temperature properties of glasses along the lines of the soft potential model based on a numeric simulation of a lennard - jones glass was presented by heuer and silbey  @xcite .",
    "they numerically searched for the energy minima of the glass and constructed double - well potentials for close minima . by extrapolation to small values they were able to extract the distribution functions for the soft potential parameters .",
    "these potentials correspond to our potentials after inclusion of the interaction between the ho s .",
    "the present theory is in agreement with their simulation results .",
    "the theory presented in this paper deals with the effects of soft modes produced by disorder which can be expected to have a broad frequency distribution . in the literature the term boson peak is rather loosely defined .",
    "often it is used for any low frequency maximum in the reduced dos . in particular in plastic crystals ,",
    "see eg . ref .",
    "@xcite , soft ho are present even before disorder .",
    "consequently disorder only broadens their sharp dos .",
    "depending on the strength of this broadening our theory will apply more or less to such cases . the same applies to tls which also can be present before disorder .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the same physical mechanism is fundamental for such seemingly different phenomena as formation of the two - level systems in glasses and the boson peak in the reduced density of low - frequency vibrational states @xmath0 . in this way two of the most fundamental properties of glasses",
