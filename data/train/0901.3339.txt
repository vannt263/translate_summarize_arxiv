    "the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) effect is a phenomenon which plays an important role in a formation of magnetic structures in different systems .",
    "the essence of the effect consists in an indirect interaction between localized spins placed in a fermi sea of non - interacting conduction electrons .",
    "the interaction is called indirect because the spins feel the presence of each other through the electrons surrounding them : a localized spin interacting with the electrons induces in the electron gas spin density oscillations which then make impact on another localized spin .",
    "the interaction underlying the rkky effect , that is the interaction between the localized spin and the electron gas , can be of different nature .",
    "it can be either the hyperfine interaction between a localized nuclear spin and conduction electrons @xcite or the exchange interaction between the conduction and localized electrons @xcite .",
    "the latter case is realized for example in alloys with transition metal ions where the conduction @xmath0-electrons and the localized @xmath1-electrons of an ion interact through the @xmath2 exchange interaction .    to model the rkky effect it is traditionally assumed that the interaction between a localized spin and conduction electrons is local in the real space .",
    "this is modeled by dirac s delta function @xcite . in the case of the hyperfine interaction this model",
    "looks quite plausible because the size of a nucleus , being of order @xmath3 nm ( see ref .  ) , is small enough . the rkky indirect exchange effect based on the hyperfine interaction",
    "was studied in the scientific literature . in ref .",
    "the rkky interaction between nuclear spins embedded in a mesoscopic ring and a finite length quantum wire was investigated in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the indirect nuclear spin interaction was found to depend on the nuclear spin positions , number of the conduction electrons , magnetic field and system s geometry .",
    "the influence of electron - electron interactions and electron spin correlations on the rkky interaction between two nuclear spins was considered by semiromi _",
    "et al._@xcite the nuclear spins were embedded in a mesoscopic metallic ring .",
    "it was numerically shown that the electron - electron interactions and electron spin correlations can essentially change the rkky interaction dependence on the magnetic flux .    however , in the case of the exchange interaction the ionic spins are much less localized .",
    "for example , the ionic radius , which we will denote by @xmath4 , for the @xmath5-shell metal ions er@xmath6 and nd@xmath6 is @xmath7 nm and @xmath8 nm ( see ref .  ) , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath4 gives an effective radius of the exchange interaction .",
    "moreover , one can easily conceive a situation where artificial objects like quantum dots with non - zero total spin are embedded in a fermi sea of conduction electrons .",
    "the interaction between the total spin of such objects and the electrons is similar to the exchange interaction and produces the rkky interaction between the total spins of those artificial objects .",
    "the value of @xmath4 can thus be     ( color online ) a non - interacting electron gas on a 1d ring of radius @xmath9 .",
    "the localized spin is centered around the ring point with the polar angle @xmath10 .",
    "the localization radius of the spin is @xmath4 which is also estimated to be the radius of the exchange interaction in the rkky effect.,width=8 ]    technologically varied .",
    "systems with quantum dots interacting through the rkky effect were already investigated in a number of scientific papers .",
    "the rkky effect between two quantum dots embedded in an aharonov - bohm ring was investigated by utsumi _",
    "et al._@xcite as a function of a magnetic flux through the ring .",
    "the quantum dots contained odd numbers of electrons .",
    "the interaction between the total quantum dots spins and the conduction electrons in the ring was described by a tunneling hamiltonian . in this tunneling hamiltonian",
    "the coupling constant was modeled by the delta function that is the interaction radius was @xmath11 . in ref .   two localized spins in one- , two- and three - dimensional electron gases were considered .",
    "decoherence of the spins was studied using the kinetic equation for the reduced density matrix .",
    "additionally , a quantum gate consisting of two quantum dots embedded in a two - dimensional electron gas of gaas / algaas heterostructure was investigated .",
    "the rkky effect was provided through the @xmath2 exchange interaction which was assumed to take place just at the positions of the localized spins , that is the interaction radius was zero .",
    "et al._@xcite studied the rkky interaction between the localized spins of two quantum dots placed at the opposite edges of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) conducting channel .",
    "the rkky interaction between the spins across the channel was taken into account by virtue of an exchange interaction where the fourier transform of the coupling constant was assumed to be momentum - dependent .",
    "this in principle means that the interaction could be non - local .",
    "however , consequences of this non - locality were out of focus of that work . in ref .",
    "the rkky interaction in a coupled quantum dot system embedded in a ring with a spin - orbit interaction was explored in the presence of the aharonov - bohm and aharonov - casher effects .",
    "the @xmath2 exchange interaction responsible for the rkky effect in this system was also local .",

    "the number of electrons is @xmath13.,width=8 ]    finally , we would like to mention that effects of the finite size of the ionic spin distribution on the rkky interaction have been studied in bulk systems in connection with ferromagnetic heusler alloys @xcite .",
    "however , the models used in those attempts did not give the delta function in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to verify by means of a simple model whether in a mesoscopic ring a finite value of @xmath4 can play any role in the formation of the electron spin density oscillations which underpin the rkky indirect exchange interaction . in the limit @xmath14 the model which we use",
    "gives the delta function .",
    "it is shown that if the interaction radius is finite , its impact on the electron spin density oscillations is to reduce the oscillation amplitude .",
    "an interesting feature is that when the number of the electrons in the gas is large enough , this reduction , produced by the presence of a small domain of size @xmath4 , is significant and takes place in the whole system with much larger size .",

    "[ figure_4 ] for different values of @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the number of the oscillations is approximately equal to 300 and thus only a small vicinity around @xmath40 is plotted to clearly show the oscillations .",
