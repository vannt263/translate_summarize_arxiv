    "the stellar content of galaxies represents the time integral , up to the epoch of observation , of both their star formation and chemical enrichment histories .",
    "this implies that an understanding of stellar populations is essential in the study of the galaxy formation problem .",
    "the nature of galaxies stellar populations may be pursued through multi - band photometric and/or spectroscopic datasets .",
    "the latter tend to be more highly valued for their greater number of population tracers ( absorption line / band strengths or full spectra versus broad - filter fluxes ) , reduced sensitivity to dust @xcite and multiplexed ability to simultaneously constrain stellar ages , metallicities , chemical abundance patterns , dynamics and mass distributions ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the present work concerns spectroscopic - based stellar population studies .    stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models are the tools which connect observations of stellar systems to their physical parameters . in order to apply them with confidence ,",
    "the accuracies of their predictions must be subjected to in - depth evaluations first .",
    "the standard approach to sps model evaluations is to verify that the predictions uniquely reproduce , to within some desired tolerance , the benchmark values of various parameters for well - characterized stellar systems obtained by way of independent and trustworthy techniques @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar systems best suited for evaluations of sps models are the many star clusters found in the milky way and its nearby satellite galaxies .",
    "the reasons for this are two - fold .",
    "first , those clusters are defined by comparitively simple star formation and chemical enrichment histories , making them the closest tangible approximation to the most basic stellar system treated by sps models . in other words",
    ", they best embody the concept of the so - called simple stellar population : a collection of stars born from an instantaneous burst of star formation and having a uniform chemical composition .",
    "second , the relative proximity of these clusters allows their stellar content to be resolved well below their respective main sequence turn - offs .",
    "this makes it possible to accurately constrain their ages via isochrone fitting to colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and abundance patterns from the synthesis of high - resolution spectra of individual members .",
    "of all the star cluster systems found in the nearby universe , the galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) are most valuable for sps model evaluations , albeit in the regime of old ages and low to solar metallicities , akin to quiescent galaxies , spiral bulges , and extragalactic globular cluster systems .",
    "the value of ggcs in this respect is tied to the fact that their stellar contents have been the most extensively studied to date through cmds and spectral syntheses .",
    "somewhat ironically , it is because of the special attention paid to ggcs that we now know of many instances where they systematically deviate from the textbook definition of a simple stellar population , largely through inhomogeneities in the abundances of several light elements ( see @xcite for a recent and detailed review ) . given the necessity of model evaluations though , the emergent complexity of ggcs is insufficient grounds to void their status as the premier sample for such purposes .",
    "instead , modellers should adjust the aim of their evaluations to reproducing the _ mean _ abundance patterns of those ggcs known to harbour multiple populations , but progress along these lines is only in its infancy @xcite .    amongst the many public sps models , that of ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter s07 ) is one of three designed to recover the abundances of light elements for an observed stellar population , in addition to the usual diagnostics of age and metallicity ; the other two models are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of these three models , that of s07 stands out as the one whose abundance predictions have been the most rigorously tested thus far over a considerable metallicity range ( @xmath1[fe / h ] @xmath2 1.2 dex ) .",
    "@xcite found that the s07 model reproduces , to within @xmath30.1 dex , the known ages , metallicities , and abundance ratios of the ggcs 47 tuc , ngc 6441 and ngc 6528 , as well as the galactic open cluster m67 . despite their success ,",
    "the sample analysed was rather small , totalling five clusters , implying that a more extensive evaluation covering a wider range in ggc properties , horizontal branch morphology , is still needed to establish the ultimate robustness of this model .",
    "for instance , these authors noted that the calcium abundance recovered for the metal - poor ggc ngc 6121 was @xmath20.3 dex lower than that measured by @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy led them to caution about the use of the s07 model in the regime [ fe / h ] @xmath4 -1.0 , precisely where the reliability of this model has been poorly validated to this point .    in their analysis",
    ", @xcite used the library of high - quality integrated blue spectra measured by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s05 ) to recover the ages , metallicities and abundance patterns for the four ggcs in their sample .",
    "indeed , the work of s05 was inspired by the need for in - depth evaluations of the accuracies of spectroscopic - based sps model predictions .",
    "as such , the authors selected their targets ( 41 in all ) to be representative of the entire ggc system , spanning a wide range of metallicities , horizontal branch morphologies , concentrations , galactocentric coordinates , and galactocentric distances . to this day , the s05 library remains the only one of its kind .",
    "in addition to it , sps model evaluations require a matching database of independent age , metallicity , and abundance pattern estimates for the 41 s05 ggcs against which the model predictions may be compared .",
    "existing compilations of ggc parameters do not satisfy these needs , however , because they either provide metallicity information alone ( @xcite , 2010 edition ; hereafter ha10 ) or overlook the abundances of certain light elements ( c , n ) and cover only a fraction of the full s05 sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pr05 ) .",
    "these shortcomings have arguably been at the heart of the statistically weak tests of the s07 and @xcite models to date .",
    "stringent validations of such sps models are thus stymied until a more complete database of independent stellar population information for this sample is assembled .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to rectify this situation by presenting the most extensive combined compilation yet of available ggc ages , metallicities , and abundance patterns .",
    "to do so , we draw on existing compilations of ggc parameters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mf09 ; ha10 ) , as well as the vast literature on the chemical compositions of the s05 clusters .",
    "the application of our data set to a statistically robust evaluation of the s07 and other sps models will be presented elsewhere ( roediger et al . , in prep . ;",
    "hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "the layout of the present paper is as follows . in",
    ", we discuss the ggc sample , methodology and some of the principal data sources which underlie our compilation .",
    "granted that our sample is representative of the ggc system as a whole , we use our compilation in to draw insights into a variety of topics related to the stellar populations of these objects .",
    "comparisons of our work with other prior compilations of ggc stellar population data are presented in .",
    "finally , we conclude and contemplate other possible uses of this compilation in .",
    "spectroscopic - based sps models are designed to predict the full spectra and/or strengths of absorption line / band indices over a wide range of ages and metallicities for simple stellar populations of any specified abundance pattern .",
    "the ability of the s07 model to fit for chemical abundances is realized by inverting its functionality , that is , by perturbing the specified abundance pattern until the same age and metallicity are obtained amongst all possible index - index pairs under consideration for an observed stellar system .",
    "practically speaking , the model steps through the @xmath5-dimensional parameter space spanned by the available data in a hierarchical fashion , beginning with indices most sensitive to age and metallicity effects ( h@xmath6 , fe5250 , fe5335 ) and ending with those that trace chemical abundances ( mg_b _ , ca4227 ) . in this way",
    ", the model simultaneously predicts the best - fit age , metallicity and light - element abundance pattern ( [ mg / fe ] , [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] ) for a given system . while the s07 model can , in principle , fit for the ratios [ o / fe ] , [ na / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ cr / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] as well , their values are fixed at this time",
    "is fixed at 0.0 or + 0.5 , depending on the adopted isochrone ( solar - scaled versus @xmath0-enhanced ) , and [ cr / fe ] at 0.0 , while [ na / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] track [ mg / fe ] . ] since they are not reliably traced by existing lick indices .",
    "@xcite presented an efficient algorithm , `` ez_ages '' , to carry out the required inversion of the s07 model so that it can be applied to the measured indices of any stellar system .",
    "further details on either the s07 model or ez_ages are provided in those introductory papers , as well as in paper ii .    for a robust evaluation of the s07 and other sps models ( paper ii ) , we will draw upon the s05 library of intermediate - dispersion , high-@xmath7 integrated blue spectra for 41 ggcs , as do most other investigators for such purposes .",
    "an important aspect of this library is the sample s wide coverage of the known ggc parameter space ( see and ) , which makes it fairly representative of the entire ggc system as well as the stellar populations of whole galaxies ( early - types ) or their sub - components ( bulges ) .",
    "either a suite of absorption - line / band strengths measured from these data or the full spectra themselves may be fitted using one of several different sps models to recover the ages , metallicities , and abundance patterns of these ggcs .",
    "the performance of any given model is then judged by comparing these fitted parameters against the most complete compilation yet of similar but independently - derived information for the s05 ggcs , the latter of which is the primary focus of this work .",
    "although the preceding discussion has largely focussed on the s07 model , it must be appreciated that our compilation is perfectly general and can be applied to the evaluation of _ any _ spectroscopic - based sps model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , such an undertaking would undoubtedly help highlight the merits of the particular ingredients and/or fitting techniques adopted by different models .",
    "our compilation may also be useful to any other field concerned with ggcs , such as the formation of the milky way , or stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis . in the following sub - section , we describe the methodology by which our compilation was assembled given the wealth of literature data pertaining to our needs . for reasons that will be made clear , this discussion will largely revolve around the abundance patterns of our clusters .",
    "the over - arching principle for our compilation of the available literature on the stellar populations of the s05 ggcs is that it be as comprehensive and complete of a record as possible . for each one of our clusters",
    "then , we have strived to obtain as many estimates as we could for its age , metallicity , and abundances of light elements , with the extent of the latter group being dictated by those elements currently treated within sps models ( mg , c , n , ca , o , na , si , cr , ti ) . while extensive and homogeneous compilations already exist with respect to ggc ages and metallicities , and cover large fractions of the s05 sample ( mf09 , ha10 ; see ) , resources of similar quality on the individual chemistries of these clusters is more limited and heterogeneous .    the premium compilation of ggc chemical compositions until now was presented by pr05 , who gathered @xmath0-element abundances ( mg , ca , si , ti ) from high - resolution spectroscopic analyses in the literature for a sample of 45 ggcs .",
    "their results prove less than ideal for the purposes of sps model evaluations since the elements c , n , o , na , and cr , which sps models now cover , were omitted and their sample has a rather small overlap with that of s05 ( 15 clusters only ) .",
    "to improve upon the shortcomings of pr05 , we extracted from the literature measurements of the relevant chemical abundance ratios for each s05 cluster from as many references as possible .",
    "in so doing , we have found that specifying a complete abundance pattern for any one s05 ggc often required data from at least two references ; for example , the abundances of carbon and nitrogen are usually studied together but separately from those of the other elements listed earlier .",
    "our desire for completeness therefore naturally encouraged us to draw on multiple sources when assembling the abundance patterns we are advocating for use here . in doing so , we have combined the results from _ all _ chemical composition studies on each cluster .",
    "the abundance pattern we adopt as the benchmark for each cluster was built by calculating the mean value and root - mean - square ( rms ) dispersion of the available independent measurements for each of the elements listed above .",
    "this aspect of our compilation embodies some noteworthy advantages .",
    "first , merging results as we do should reduce the",
    "_ statistical _ error in the value that we recommend for any given abundance ratio , albeit at the price of increasing its _ systematic _ error .",
    "we do not consider this a drawback but rather another advantage of our approach since systematic errors ( sample selection , solar abundances , atomic parameters ) might be a significant source of discrepancy between abundance patterns predicted by sps models and star - by - star spectral syntheses . having a metric for the degree of systematic error involved in the latter , via the dispersions ,",
    "will undoubtedly be very helpful for judging the reality of model predictions .",
    "the last advantage of our approach is that it should also naturally reflect the existence of putative multiple stellar populations when present within a given cluster ( again , via the dispersions ) .",
    "a hallmark of the multiple population phenomenon is that , amongst the members of an affected cluster , the abundances of several elements either correlate ( al - si ) or anti - correlate ( c - n , na - o , mg - al ) with one another @xcite . modulo the particulars on sample selection , we then expect to find large spreads in the abundance ratios of these elements between the stars from either a single study or multiple ones .",
    "moreover , by combining such scattered measurements into a single estimate for a cluster s abundance pattern , we can be assured that the corresponding dispersions reflect the presence of multiple populations by being comparitively large to those of species which are excluded from the above trends ( ca ) .",
    "note that any and all claims we make herein as to the causes of inflated rms dispersions ( re : systematics versus multiple populations ) are ultimately suggestive and not based on thorough quantitative analyses .",
    "another major principle for our compilation involves concentrating , where possible , on studies whose results pertain solely to evolutionary stages from the main sequence ( ms ) through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "we impose such a restriction because the onset of thermal flashes , third dredge - ups , dust - gas separation ( winnowing ) and mass loss during the final ( post - agb ) stage in the evolution of low - mass stars can give rise to surface abundances which poorly reflect the chemical composition of the gas from which they formed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "third dredge - up episodes , in particular , would pollute the surfaces of such highly - evolved stars with cno - processed material from the hydrogen - burning shell ( if present ) , effectively lowering the abundance of carbon and raising that of nitrogen there , relative to those of ms stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "stars ascending the sub - giant and red giant branches ( sgb and rgb , respectively ) can also have their surface chemistries of c , n , and o affected by mixing episodes ( @xcite , @xcite ; ) , but given that most spectroscopic analyses of individual ggc members do not penetrate to fainter magnitudes than this phase precludes our rejection of such data .",
    "in other words , limiting our mean carbon and nitrogen abundances only to measurements obtained from ms stars would significantly thin out our compilation .",
    "instead , we embrace such data and simply caution sps modellers to consider the evolutionary stage down to which their predicted [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] values correspond . in",
    "we highlight the possibility that carbon depletion and nitrogen enhancement as a function of position along the sgb / rgb may be crudely quantified .",
    "in addition to highly - evolved stars , we also exclude from our compilation ( again , where possible ) data corresponding to `` exotic '' stages of stellar evolution , such as very hot ( @xmath8 11 500 k ) horizontal branch ( hb ) stars . in this case",
    ", the surface abundances of elements are often perturbed by effects like radiative levitation and gravitational sedimentation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . unlike the case of mixing along the sgb / rgb though",
    ", it is unclear that empirical corrections for these processes are forthcoming simply because it is rare to find individual ggcs with mixtures of exotic plus `` normal '' ( @xmath9 11 500 k ) hb stars , let alone homogeneous abundance analyses thereof .",
    "thus , unless data from the ms , sgb , rgb , ( cooler ) hb , and agb for a cluster are all not available , we deem abundance ratios based on the most advanced and exotic stages of stellar evolution unsuitable for our purposes and omit them from our compilation .    in light of the above caveats , we wish to provide the exact rationale behind our compiled abundance pattern for each s05 cluster .",
    "we do just this , in brief and on a per cluster basis , in the appendix , with attention being paid to the following related themes : adopted references , omitted data , systematic errors , and evidence of multiple populations from both our data and other methods ( where applicable ) . also provide the relevant references from which our recommended ages , metallicities , and abundance patterns for the s05 ggcs were drawn . in the following section , we specifically address our sources and methodology used to arrive at the ages and metallicities of the s05 clusters .",
    "much of that information will therefore not be repeated in the appendix .",
    "our selection of sources for age and metallicity information on the s05 ggcs embraces similar principles as described above regarding their abundance patterns . in terms of their ages ,",
    "a cursory review of the relevant literature reminds us of genuine discrepancies on a per cluster basis .",
    "while isochrone fitting of one form or another to cmds has long been the standard by which ggc ages are obtained , the results therefrom appear to be plagued by rather large uncertainties .",
    "the origins of these discrepancies are most likely tied to the values of various parameters assumed by the scientist ( distance , reddening , metallicity , etc . ) and/or each isochrone set ( mixing length , helium abundance , etc . ) . since little",
    "is to be practically learned by merging together the available absolute age determinations for any given cluster ( unlike the case with their chemical abundances ) , we prefer our compiled values of this parameter to come from a single source .",
    "the majority of the ages adopted in our compilation come from mf09 .",
    "these authors have performed the most extensive and homogeneous age analysis of ggcs to date , totalling 64 clusters in all and using hst / acs photometry plus many flavours of isochrones @xcite .",
    "the ages in this work from the dotter et  al .",
    "isochrones were cast in terms of both the @xcite and @xcite metallicity scales . by normalizing their results from each isochrone set to the corresponding mean absolute age of their 13 lowest - metallicity ggcs",
    ", mf09 found that the _ relative _ ages were robust to the particular choice of isochrone ( see their table 4 ) and carried a formal precision between 2 - 7% .",
    "for the 25 s05 ggcs which overlap with the mf09 sample , we adopt their relative ages based on the dotter et  al .  isochrones and carretta & gratton scale . from their  6.1",
    ", we assume a normalization factor of 12.80 @xmath3 0.17 gyr to put these ages on an absolute footing .",
    "note that the uncertainty in the normalizing factor does not account for systematics , bolometric corrections , but we anticipate this issue will be thoroughly addressed in forthcoming work on absolute ggc ages by the same group , as alluded to in mf09 .    to bolster the reliability of their _ relative _ ages , mf09 also compared them against those of @xcite , the formerly largest homogeneous ggc age compilation , totalling 55 clusters in all . in doing so",
    ", they found mutual consistency between the two datasets to within their own published error bars , where de angeli et al.s hst and ground - based sub - samples yielded mean residuals of -0.04 @xmath3 0.07 and -0.02 @xmath3 0.08 , respectively . furthermore , mf09 failed to detect any trends in the residuals as a function of metallicity .",
    "we conduct a similar comparison in , but in terms of _ absolute _ ages and with respect to multiple prior age compilations @xcite , where the relative ages from rosenberg et  al .",
    "were transformed assuming a zeropoint of 13.2 gyr ( see their  4 ) . to ensure the comparison is fair ,",
    "we limited it to the twelve s05 ggcs common to all four compilations examined therein .",
    "the mutual overlap between the samples of mf09 and other age compilations in the literature @xcite is actually poorer than this and so we have omitted those results from .",
    "instead , we compare in the appendix ( wherever possible ) our adopted ages against _ all _ other estimates in the literature known to us , on a per cluster basis .",
    "such an exercise provides us with a first - order impression of the systematic discrepancies involved between any two individual age determinations .",
    "there , we also provide the normalization factors or constants we have used to transform those ages originally expressed on relative scales into absolute terms .",
    "the most striking feature from is the presence of several clusters in each panel whose ages from prior compilations disagree egregiously with those of mf09 .",
    "these disagreements are found in different age and metallicity regimes , depending on the source under consideration : young ages and low metallicities for @xcite , old ages and high metallicities for @xcite , and at both age and metallicity extrema for @xcite .",
    "of course , the identification of these inconsistencies hinges on how representative the published uncertainties are of the total error budget .",
    "the error bars shown in are largely statistical in nature and do not consider the systematic effects of uncertainties in , amongst many others , distance modulus , reddening and stellar evolution model . with exception to the results of dotter et al .",
    ", this criticism may be unwarranted or overstated since the investigators employed distance- and reddening - independent methods ( rosenberg et al . ;",
    "salaris & weiss ) and/or provided _ relative _ ages only ( rosenberg et al . ;",
    "mf09 ) . overall then , leaves us with the impression that systematic uncertainties in absolute age dating of ggcs resides ( at worst ) at the 2 - 3 gyr level .",
    "neglecting ages which exceed that of the universe ( 13.76 @xmath3 0.11 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this estimate is corroborated by our cluster - by - cluster comparisons of individual age determinations in the appendix . a more detailed examination than that of this issue lies beyond the scope of this paper .    while the existence of significant systematics in absolute age determinations might suggest that , for now , it be best to evaluate age predictions from sps models in a relative sense , it is not clear that this can be done in practice .",
    "one complication is that the s05 sample does not contain the same clusters upon which mf09 base their normalization .",
    "another is that , for the sake of completeness of our compilation , we appeal to five other sources of age information for 13 of the 16 s05 ggcs which do not overlap with the mf09 sample .",
    "based on , it is clear that transformations of these results onto the mf09 scale would at best be crudely defined .",
    "therefore , until a more complete source of relative ages for the s05 ggcs becomes available , sps modellers will have to bear in mind the systematics underpinning the absolute ages against which they test their predictions . to assist in this awareness ,",
    "we explicitly caution the reader in the appendix about those clusters in our sample for which their adopted age _ does not _",
    "come from mf09 .",
    "our extensive list of references which provide independent age measurements for the s05 ggcs is summarized globally in and for individual clusters in .",
    "note that the specific reference of our adopted age for each cluster is shown in boldface in the latter .",
    "our knowledge of the metallicities of the s05 ggcs has greatly improved with the work of @xcite . based on high - resolution optical spectra for about 2000",
    "rgb stars belonging to 19 ggcs ( 13 of which are in the s05 sample ) , these authors have created the premier database of homogeneous and spectroscopic metallicities for ggcs . through it , they have defined a new ggc metallicity scale spanning almost the full range of values exhibited by these systems in this parameter space , from [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -2.4 to -0.3 dex . since carretta et al.s sample overlaps with those from previous metallicity scales @xcite by ten clusters or more , they were also able to derive transformations between those and their own .",
    "this enabled them to express the metallicities of all 133 ggcs from the 2003 version of the @xcite catalogue , which encompasses our whole sample , in terms of their own scale .",
    "ha10 improves upon the work of @xcite by merging the latter s results with those of @xcite , after first transforming them to the carretta et  al .",
    "scale , as well as metallicities for individual clusters from other studies . given its complete coverage of the s05 sample and the sheer popularity of this database",
    ", we would ideally adopt the metallicities from ha10 for our compilation .",
    "however , since ha10 do not provide uncertainties on their values , we instead calculate the mean metallicities of our clusters using the same references and weighting scheme as ha10 .",
    "the bottom panel of shows the differences between the ha10 metallicities and our replicas thereof .",
    "considering the complete s05 sample , the agreement between the two datasets is superb , with 68% of the data points exhibiting differences of @xmath30.01 dex or less .",
    "we also find that our adopted metallicities compare favorably with those from carretta et  al .",
    "( , _ top _ ) , albeit with 68% of the data points showing differences up to @xmath30.05 dex .",
    "this agreement is not all that surprising as the ha10 metallicities , and thus our replicas as well , are weighted to the data of carretta et  al .  by a factor of three more than those from any other source .",
    "the results of our literature compilation on the stellar population properties of the s05 ggcs are presented in and . in , we list the recommended age ( column 2 ) , mean metallicity ( column 3 ) , and mean mg , c , n , and ca abundances ( columns 4 - 7 ) for each cluster , while gives their mean o , na , si , cr , and ti abundances ( columns 2 - 6 ) . entries therein which we consider suspect with respect to our compilation principles ( elucidated above ) appear in boldface ; the reader is referred to the appendix for the rationale behind each of these flags .",
    "recall that , because of practical limitations which bar the computation of relative ages from both literature data and sps models for _ all _ of the s05 ggcs , we have cast all of our compiled ages into absolute terms . in light of the apparent systematics which afflict absolute age estimates ,",
    "we look forward to future work from expert groups which properly address this issue . until then",
    ", sps modellers will simply have to be mindful of these uncertainties in our compiled data , which we optimistically gauge to be @xmath22 - 3 gyr , when evaluating age predictions .",
    "while the original intent of the present compilation was for evaluations of sps models , we foresee its broad applicability to a variety of astrophysical endeavours since the s05 sample is representative of the whole ggc system (; ) . to demonstrate this point",
    ", we use our compilation in the following sub - sections to garner some brief insight into the early formation and chemical evolution of the milky way , atmospheric mixing during stellar evolution and the sites of explosive stellar nucleosynthesis .      in",
    "we show the distributions of all the stellar population diagnostics presented in for the whole s05 sample . referring to and the mf09 results shown therewithin ( black histogram )",
    ", it is seen that the s05 sample has an age distribution which is both strongly - peaked ( between 12.5 and 13 gyr ) and skewed to very old ages .",
    "those clusters whose ages come from other sources in the literature are represented by the gray histogram .",
    "these additional estimates tend to broaden the overall distribution to both younger and older ages , as well as the strong peak described by the mf09 results .",
    "the fact that over half of these other age determinations are found to have extreme values in relation to those from mf09 bolsters our position on treating them with caution .",
    "note that the shaded region in demarcates ages which exceed that of the universe @xcite and while some of our clusters are found there , the statistical errors on their values alone overlap with the allowed ( unshaded ) region .    from the mf09 ages in",
    ", it is tempting to conclude that the s05 ggcs originated from a two - component star formation history .",
    "this history could be described as consisting of either a sharp burst superimposed upon a comparitively steady background ( lasting @xmath104 gyr ) or a vigourous early episode which quickly peaked and was then regulated down to a more sustainable level . by broadening the overall distribution to more extreme ages , the additional literature data shown in seems to agree better with the first of these two scenarios .",
    "modulo systematics , these data would temper this scenario though by spreading the burst component over a longer timescale ( @xmath21.0 - 1.5 gyr ) .",
    "the metallicity distribution for the s05 ggcs ( ) also appears to support the idea that these clusters arose from at least two distinct channels given its clear bimodal shape ( in agreement with @xcite ) , with a peak - to - peak separation of about @xmath21.0 dex .",
    "when we examine the available mf09 ages of the clusters comprising each metallicity sub - group however ( ) , there does not appear to be a strong correlation between the two parameters .",
    "the metal - poor and metal - rich ggcs of our sample , separated at [ fe / h ] = -1.0 dex , which overlap with mf09 have a mean age and rms dispersion of 12.0 @xmath3 1.1 gyr and 12.8 @xmath3 0.7 gyr , respectively ; the distinction of these two groups by age only worsens when we consider all of our adopted values .",
    "the situation seen in can be attributed to the presence of several old ggcs ( @xmath1112 gyr ) in our metal - poor sub - sample , whereas only one of our metal - rich ggcs has an age of @xmath1212 gyr . moreover ,",
    "our metal - rich sub - sample harbours a high incidence of very old clusters in that three ( four , if the metal - rich/-poor boundary lay slightly lower ; = -1.05 ) of our six oldest objects are contained therewithin .",
    "since our sample is representative of the entire ggc system , these findings bear some implications with regards to the formation of the milky way , in particular its halo . for instance",
    ", the parameter spread in would be hard to explain within a scenario in which _ all _ of the s05 ggcs formed in situ since one would expect the metal - poor ggcs to be _ older _ than the metal - rich ones , not younger . instead",
    ", this spread is consistent with a picture in which the ggc system arose from its members either forming in situ or being accreted from satellite galaxies .",
    "although the possible correlation of these two channels with metallicity remains unclear , we interpret the older , metal - rich and younger , metal - poor clusters as the descendants of the former and latter , respectively .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached by other analyses of the ggc age - metallicity relation using much larger samples ( mf09 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further insight into this topic might be achieved by searching for correlations between the above parameters and those from the ha10 catalogue , particularly velocity information , but such a task is beyond the scope of this work . @xcite and",
    "mf09 already investigated the relationship between age and galactocentric radius for ggcs , and found none .",
    "further critical insight into the stellar populations that comprise ggcs can be gleaned from the distributions of their mean chemical abundance ratios , as shown in .",
    "these , in turn , afford us with further information on the formation of the milky way , as well as certain aspects related to stellar evolution . from , we first note that the distributions of the mean abundances of the @xmath0-elements ( mg , ca , si , ti ) amongst these systems all show sharp peaks towards super - solar values . the respective median values for the [ mg / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , [ si / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] distributions are + 0.38 , + 0.30 , + 0.36 and + 0.24 dex , which implies that the ggc system , on the whole , formed over rapid timescales . on the other hand ,",
    "slightly broader distributions are found for mean abundances of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen amongst our ggcs , in that we obtain rms dispersions of @xmath100.15 dex for them compared to @xmath40.1 dex for the @xmath0-elements .",
    "apart from possible undersampling effects - element abundances for 25 of our ggcs , while c , n , and o abundances are known for half of our sample , at best . ] , we interpret the broader distributions of these elements as reflecting the combined and well - known phenomena of atmospheric mixing and multiple stellar populations within these clusters .",
    "we concentrate on the former for the remainder of this sub - section and take up the latter in the next .    to bolster the above argument",
    ", we show with coloured points in the mean abundances and luminosities of stars from each individual study of the carbon and nitrogen abundances in the s05 ggcs .",
    "unfortunately , not all studies we cite in this regard could be represented in these plots since luminosity information is not available to us in many cases .",
    "this may be responsible for the apparent gap in the data in the range -0.5 @xmath13 + 0.5 mag .",
    "the point types in reflect whether the assorted samples consist of cn - weak ( triangles ) or cn - strong ( diamonds ) stars ; circles are used when cn strengths are unknown to us .",
    "moreover , looking from bright to faint luminosities , the evolutionary status of the sample changes from predominantly rgb stars ( leftmost - to - middle ) to sgb / ms stars ( rightmost ) .    concentrating only on the mean values for cn - weak and cn - strong stars ,",
    "an evolutionary trend is apparent from whereby [ c / fe ] tends to monotonically decrease as a given star leaves the ms and ascends the rgb . over the same evolutionary path , [ n / fe ] for the star will decrease to a minimum at about @xmath14 + 1 mag and rise thereafter .",
    "these same trends are also conveyed by the coloured points in , where we circumvent the need for luminosity information and thus benefit from better statistics .",
    "the significant scatter amongst the data points representing both individual stars and mean values for unclassified samples may be due to mundane issues like systematics or more nuanced ones like mixtures of cn - weak and cn - strong stars within any one study .",
    "an example of each case might be the solar - like [ c / fe ] value of upper - rgb stars in ngc 6121 at @xmath14 -2 mag @xcite for the former and the [ n / fe ] value of lower - rgb stars in ngc 7078 at @xmath14 + 2 mag @xcite for the latter .",
    "the mixture interpretation is supported by analyses of _ single _ clusters that have found large spreads in [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] of stars at any common evolutionary phase from the ms through the tip of the rgb ( ngc 0104 , 6205 , 6254 , 6397 , 6752 , 7006 ; @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the evolutionary trends seen in are commonly associated with a combination of the first dredge - up ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) followed by deep atmospheric mixing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that occur in the atmospheres of low - mass stars after they complete core - hydrogen burning .",
    "the first dredge - up is defined by the mixing of partially - processed material from the stellar interior into the outer atmosphere as the convective envelope grows in size during the star s sgb phase .",
    "it is responsible for the gentle decline observed in both [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] from the ms to about the midpoint of the rgb ( @xmath14 + 1 mag ) .",
    "once the star reaches the rgb bump , deep mixing is thought to set in and create the rapid rate of depletion and ( now ) enhancement of atmospheric carbon and nitrogen , respectively .",
    "deep mixing accomplishes this by bringing cn(o)-processed material from the hydrogen - burning shell into the outer atmosphere once the shell overcomes the molecular weight barrier left by the first dredge - up and expands into the outer convective envelope .",
    "both the luminosity of the bump ( onset of mixing ) and the depletion rate of carbon are known to decrease as a function of metallicity @xcite .",
    "these two dependencies may help explain some of the scatter seen in at high luminosities ( @xmath15 0 mag ) .    in light of the fact that evolved",
    "stars undergo episodes of atmospheric mixing , it seems conceivable that the distributions of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] in our compilation would be somewhat broader than those of unaffected species , as seen in .",
    "the reason for this is that spectroscopic studies of resolved ggc members have historically measured [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] from a variety of evolutionary stages .",
    "were measurements of these ratios for ms stars to become available for our entire sample , we would anticipate a tightening of the corresponding distributions . until that time comes",
    ", the reality of these mixing episodes should compel sps modellers to carefully consider the luminosity biases of published spectroscopic studies of individual ggc members when evaluating the accuracies of their [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] predictions .",
    "in addition to mixing phenomena , also shows that some intrinsic degree of broadening in the [ c / fe ] and ( especially ) [ n / fe ] distributions for the s05 ggcs is to be expected on account of the multiple populations found within many of them . from those plots",
    ", it is seen that the dichotomy in cn band strength ( weak / strong ) extends down to the ms , the cn band is much more sensitive to [ n / fe ] than [ c / fe ] , and cn - weak stars are characterized by lower [ c / fe ] and higher [ n / fe ] values than cn - strong stars .",
    "the union of these facts then creates the potential for the mean values of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] from any given study to be biased either low or high depending on how accurately the sample embodies the true cn distribution of the associated cluster .",
    "in fact , we might be able to infer the as yet unknown cn strengths of certain samples based on the relative proximity of circlular points to the triangular or diamond points in .",
    "another hallmark of the multiple population phenomenon is the anti - correlation of [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] ratios exhibited by stars from all major evolutionary stages within affected clusters @xcite .",
    "the existence of this anti - correlation would thus tend to bias estimates of a given cluster s mean abundances of these species if not accounted for during sample selection .",
    "we suspect that this effect may be at least a contributing factor to the relatively broader distribution for [ o / fe ] seen in , compared to those of abundance ratios that are not known to vary from star - to - star .",
    "this suspicion could be tested by investigating whether the breadth of our [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] distributions is _ simultaneously _ consistent with the observed ranges in these abundance ratios for individual stars from the large , homogeneous na - o anti - correlation study of @xcite .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work however .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this juncture that the exact origins of the multiple populations observed in ggcs remains unknown .",
    "the perpetuation of chemical abundance variations down to unevolved , ms stars makes strongly certain that the existence of a second ( and sometimes third ; @xcite ) generation of stars is tied to an external agent .",
    "however , at least three candidates could be responsible for the pattern of enhanced nitrogen , sodium , aluminum , and ( possibly ) helium abundances plus depleted carbon , oxygen , and magnesium abundances that typifies the younger generations : ( i ) massive agb stars @xcite , ( ii ) massive rotating ms stars @xcite and ( iii ) as in ( i ) but for intermediate masses @xcite .",
    "one way to help distinguish between these candidates is to study whether the sum of the cno elements varies between the populations in each affected cluster .",
    "simply put , massive stars are expected to alter the individual abundances of these elements but leave their sum unchanged , while intermediate - mass agb stars , by way of the third dredge - up , will not .",
    "evidence thus far of variations in the cno sum within individual clusters has been contentious @xcite . with some work",
    ", our extensive compilation of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen abundances for individual ggc stars may be helpful in shedding further light on this issue , but will not be investigated further here .      while point to the existence of atmospheric mixing episodes within the evolved stars of the s05 ggcs , shows that the mean abundances of @xmath0-elements amongst these clusters remain more or less homogeneous .",
    "this homogeneity is accounted for within the context of mixing by the fact that @xmath0-elements are exempt from the cn(o ) cycle , such that their abundances likely reflect the chemistry of the gas from which these ggcs were born .",
    "moreover , that the @xmath0-element abundance ratios for the s05 ggcs are all greater than the solar value by factors of 1.7 - 2.4 implies that these systems must have formed quite rapidly , on timescales less than that of type ia supernovae ( @xmath21 gyr ) .",
    "an interesting corollary on the chemical enrichment of ggcs , based on their @xmath0-element abundances , is presented in .",
    "the left - hand panel shows [ ca / fe ] versus [ mg / fe ] for individual stars from our compilation and belonging to the 13 s05 clusters having the most measurements in this regard .",
    "these data are clearly uncorrelated and scatter about their centroid at ( [ mg / fe],[ca / fe ] ) @xmath2 ( + 0.4,+0.3 ) with rms dispersions ( 0.13 - 0.14 dex ) comparable to the median errors in the individual stellar abundances ( 0.12 - 0.14 dex ) .",
    "these evidences are enough to suggest that the production sites of these two chemical species are not one and the same .    in the right - hand panel of ,",
    "we show with open squares the mean magnesium and calcium abundances from pr05 for the nine clusters in the left - hand panel that fall within their sample . excluding the single outlier at ( [ mg / fe],[ca / fe ] ) @xmath2 ( + 0.10,+0.24 )",
    ", we find the rather surprising result that these abundances are _",
    "anti_-correlated for this sub - sample and data .",
    "not surprisingly , the corresponding values from our compilation ( filled circles ) exhibit no such correlation .",
    "this discrepant behaviour between our results and those of pr05 could arise from the different approaches taken with respect to the following issues : ( i ) scope of input data , ( ii ) averaging method , and ( iii ) systematics .",
    "the latter refers to pr05 s attempt to homogenize all of their input data to the same log_gf _ and solar abundance scale , something we neglect to do . to appreciate the potential role of systematics ,",
    "we also show in this panel , with open circles , the mean abundances we derive based on the same references and averaging method used by pr05 , but without log_gf _ and solar abundance corrections . for each cluster , we connect with a line the abundances from the three distinct methods . comparing the positions of open squares and circles ,",
    "it is clear that the choice of atomic constants and solar abundance pattern often plays a significant role in setting the values of [ x / fe ] for any element x , by as much as @xmath30.2 dex . on the other hand ,",
    "the offsets between open and filled circles may be regarded as the effect of our using more references per cluster and straight averages , as well as neglecting systematic corrections .",
    "our methodology clearly affects our adopted abundance patterns as well , but this should not reflect any fundamental flaws in our results .",
    "the prospect of anti - correlated magnesium and calcium abundances amongst the ggc population supports the inference that the production sites of these two species are not one and the same or , even more intriguing , that the yields of type ii supernovae fluctuate on an element - by - element level .",
    "note that such a trend is also found amongst the points in the right - hand panel of which represent the results of our attempt to mimic the approach of pr05 ( open circles ) , again modulo a single outlier .",
    "when the full sample of either compilation is considered , however , this anti - correlation changes to a weak positive correlation .",
    "the fact that neither sample is complete though implies that further investigation of the ratios [ mg / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] amongst individual ggc stars on a larger , more homogeneous basis may be warranted .",
    "the suggestion that the abundances of magnesium and carbon do not track one another within any given stellar population is not new . for instance , several studies of the central stellar populations of early - type galaxies have concluded that [ mg / fe ] increases modestly with velocity dispersion amongst these systems , but that [ ca / fe ] is uniform , at about the solar value @xcite .",
    "@xcite casted doubt on the authenticity of these results by pointing out that the ca4227 index , a popular tracer of calcium abundance , has its blue pseudocontinuum contaminated by a cn band . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown , however , that the [ ca / fe ] ratio remains uniform amongst red sequence galaxies even when the abundances of carbon and nitrogen are properly accounted for _ a priori_.    in the milky way , @xcite found that while [ ca / fe ] decreases with increasing [ fe / h ] for rgb stars in the bulge , their [ mg / fe ] ratios remain more or less uniform at @xmath2 + 0.3 dex .",
    "earlier claims to this same effect were made by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these discrepant trends may only apply to the galactic bulge though , since the calcium abundances of both metal - poor field and thick disk stars behave in a fashion consistent with that exhibited by the other @xmath0 elements @xcite .",
    "the sum of the above discrepancies results in a confusing picture , to say the least , of how stellar systems enrich themselves in the @xmath0-elements .",
    "one possible solution is that the abundance pattern of a system , and thus the source(s ) of its chemical evolution , depends sensitively on the intensity of the star formation from which it was created .",
    "for instance , the spheroidal systems which seem to exhibit genuine differences in the behaviours of their mg and ca abundances ( early - type galaxies , milky way bulge , and ggcs ) likely formed most of their stellar mass over rapid timescales . in other systems , the star formation history could very well have been more protracted , leading to potentially different sources of chemical enrichment .",
    "a most useful test of this proposed solution would be to see if and how chemodynamical simulations could reproduce the precise pattern of @xmath0-element abundances we find in our ggcs .",
    "having presented our compilation and advertised some of the immediate science that can be gleaned from it , it would also be prudent to assess the robustness of our results by comparing them to those from previous similar work .",
    "the comparison of our adopted ages and metallicities against other sources of such information has already been performed elsewhere (; appendix ) so that we need only focus here on the chemical abundance patterns of our clusters .    as stated before , the most extensive survey of the literature on ggc chemical abundance patterns prior to our compilation was made by pr05 .",
    "we already compared their results against ours in terms of the ratios [ mg / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] in the right - hand panel of . in we",
    "expand on this comparison by plotting our estimates versus theirs of the metallicities and @xmath0-element abundances ( mg , ca , si , ti ) for the 15 ggcs common to both samples . despite several outliers , a good correspondence clearly exists between the pr05 metallicities and our own .",
    "conversely , the large scatter and low pearson coefficients ( shown at top - left ) exhibited by the other sets of points in means we can not reach the same conclusion regarding the abundances of @xmath0-elements . specifically , our results compare least favourably to those of pr05 in terms of [ ca / fe ] . by inspection of pr05 s methodology , we find that the most egregious discrepancies between the two sets of abundance ratios can be explained by two effects .",
    "these are : ( i ) our inclusion of references that post - dated their work , and ( ii ) corrections that pr05 implemented to standardize literature data to a common log _ gf _ system and solar abundance pattern .",
    "the latter corrections can often be significant in size ( @xmath20.2 dex ) , a point which was already hinted at in .",
    "as pr05 point out though , abundance analyses are often published without specifying the assumed log _ gf _ values and solar abundances , making it difficult ( if not impossible ) to gauge what those corrections should be .",
    "we therefore abstain from attempting such corrections ourselves and instead embrace the fact that our adopted abundance patterns likely suffer from the full effect of the systematics which underpin spectral syntheses .",
    "drawing on a wealth of literature data up to mid-2012 , we have assembled a new compilation of the known ages , metallicities , and chemical abundance patterns for the 41 ggcs studied by s05 .",
    "this extensive compilation represents a singular expansion upon similar but more limited previous work on the stellar populations of these systems @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that it will prove to be a key ingredient for stringent evaluations of the absolute reality and robustness of predictions from the latest suite of sps models designed to recover the above information for unresolved systems ( roediger et al . , in prep .",
    "given the wide range of parameter space spanned by the s05 sample , our compilation should also benefit a wide range of other astrophysical interests .",
    "the age distribution for these clusters suggests that they arose from a star formation history that consisted of a strong peak ( 12.5 - 13.0 gyr ago ) superimposed upon a relatively smooth background . combining this information with their metallicities and @xmath0-element abundances",
    ", it appears that each ggc was formed rapidly either in situ or in a satellite galaxy and subsequently accreted onto the milky way .",
    "furthermore , with our compiled abundance patterns we confirm previous claims that ( i ) the surface abundances of c and n in evolved stars are altered by mixing episodes as they ascend the sgb / rgb , ( ii ) many ggcs host at least two distinct stellar populations , and ( iii ) the enrichment of @xmath0-elements in these systems , specifically mg and ca , likely occurred through multiple channels .",
    "the fact that the mean chemical abundance patterns of ggcs are sensitive to the first two phenomena are important caveats that must be considered during sps model evaluations .",
    "similarly , we estimate that absolute age determinations for ggcs are subject to systematic uncertainties on the order of @xmath22 - 3 gyr .",
    "while the above results are certainly of some value , it is our opinion that many other applications of our compilation have yet to be explored . to enable the community to further pursue such ancillary science or modify the results of our compilation as they see fit , we provide electronic tables of the input data online for each one of our clusters",

    "in this appendix , we provide on a cluster - by - cluster basis all known sources to us of ages and chemical abundance ratios for each of the s05 ggcs .",
    "we also list sources of metallicity information , but restricted to those we have adopted since an exhaustive list for each cluster would be prohibitively large while adding little benefit .",
    "regarding the chemical abundance references , we explicitly identify those included in our compilation and their respective statistical richnesses ( number of measurements , @xmath16 ) , outline our justification(s ) for any exclusions thereof , and point out instances where we think systematic discrepancies might be an issue . for those clusters in our sample known to harbour multiple stellar populations , we also comment on possible signatures of this phenomenon within our adopted abundance patterns and relate them to other evidence . on the other hand , for the age references we concentrate on comparing the independent measurements against our adopted values or the estimated age of the universe ( 13.76 @xmath3 0.11 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to highlight the ( sometimes severe ) degree of systematic error inherent to this quantity .",
    "pinpointing the various sources of this error would be best accomplished on a per cluster basis though and so is beyond the scope of the present work .    unless stated otherwise",
    ", our adopted ages come from mf09 .",
    "we omit the ages from @xcite on the grounds that nearly all of them for the s05 clusters exceed the age of the universe .",
    "also note that the relative ages from @xcite refer to the @xcite metallicity scale and were transformed assuming a normalization of 10.9 gyr .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite ages were re - cast into absolute terms by adding to them a zeropoint of 15.0 and 13.2 gyr , respectively .",
    "the zeropoint for the ages from @xcite varies from 14.0 gyr for the most metal - rich clusters to 16.0 gyr for the most metal - poor ones .      following ha10 , we use the measured metallicities from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to calculate the weighted [ fe / h ] for ngc 0104 .",
    "the large body of work on the chemical composition of this cluster covers all major evolutionary stages , including the ms @xcite [ @xmath16 = 173 ] , rgb @xcite [ @xmath16 = 190 ] , hb @xcite [ @xmath16 = 1 ] and agb @xcite [ @xmath16 = 21 ] , all of which we fold into our compiled abundance pattern .",
    "conversely , we excluded the results of @xcite and @xcite from the present work on the grounds that they did not provide abundances for the individual stars comprising their respective samples .",
    "a plethora of evidence on this cluster strongly suggests that it hosts multiple stellar populations , which includes variations in either the spectroscopic band strengths ( cn , ch ) or light - element abundances ( c , n , o , na , mg , al ) of individual stars over a wide range of evolutionary stages @xcite , distinct photometric main and red giant branch sequences @xcite and radial gradients in both colour and he abundance @xcite . from our compilation , we find some support for the notion that ngc 0104 hosts multiple populations via the slightly enhanced rms envelopes on our mean [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , [ na / fe ] and [ o / fe ] ratios ( @xmath170.2 dex , compared to @xmath180.15 dex for other species ) . given this cluster s well - established abundance anti - correlations @xcite",
    ", we suggest that systematics between the available abundance measurements of ca , si , cr and ti may be responsible for weakening the multiple - population signal in our data . finally , the age of ngc 0104 has been determined in several other studies to date @xcite , the values from which span a range of 12.0 - 14.7 gyr for this parameter and are formally consistent with the one we have adopted ( 13.1 @xmath3 0.9 gyr ) .",
    "exceptional cases concern those measurements which either fall below our adopted value by 1.1 - 2.4 gyr ( 1.2 - 1.8@xmath19 ; * ? ?",
