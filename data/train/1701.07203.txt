    "frequently it is the case in the study of real - world complex networks that we observe essentially a sample from a larger network .",
    "there are many reasons why sampling in networks is often unavoidable  and , in some cases , even desirable .",
    "sampling , for example , has long been a necessary part of studying internet topology  @xcite .",
    "similarly , its role has been long - recognized in the context of biological networks , e.g. , protein - protein interaction @xcite , gene regulation @xcite and metabolic networks @xcite .",
    "finally , in recent years , there has been intense interest in the use of sampling for monitoring online social media networks .",
    "see  @xcite , for example , for a representative list of articles in this latter domain . given a sample from a network , a fundamental statistical question is how the sampled network statistics be used to make inferences about the parameters of the underlying global network .",
    "parameters of interest in the literature include ( but are by no means limited to ) degree distribution , density , diameter , clustering coefficient , and number of connected components . for seminal work in this direction , see  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose potential solutions to an estimation problem that appears to have received significantly less attention in the literature to date ",
    "the estimation of the degrees of individual sampled nodes .",
    "degree is one of the most fundamental of network metrics , and is a basic notion of node - centrality .",
    "deriving a good estimate of the node degree , in turn , can be helpful in estimating other global parameters , as many such parameters can be viewed as functions that include degree as an argument . while a number of methods are available to estimate the full degree distribution under network sampling ( e.g. , @xcite ) , little work appears to have been done on estimating the individual node degrees .",
    "our work addresses this gap .",
    "formally , our interest lies in estimation of the degree of a vertex , provided that vertex is selected in a sample of the underlying graph .",
    "there are many sampling designs for graphs .",
    "see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch 5 ) for a review of the classical literature , and  @xcite for a recent survey .",
    "canonical examples include ego - centric sampling@xcite , snowball sampling , induced / incident subgraph sampling , link - tracing and random walk based methods@xcite . under certain sampling designs where one observes the true degree of the sampled node ( e.g. ego - centric and one - wave snowball sampling ) ,",
    "degree estimation is unnecessary . in this paper",
    ", we focus on _ induced subgraph sampling _ , which is structurally representative of a number of other sampling strategies@xcite .",
    "formally , in induced subgraph sampling , a set of nodes is selected according to independent bernoulli(@xmath0 ) trials at each node .",
    "then , the subgraph induced by the selected nodes , i.e. , the graph generated by selecting edges between selected nodes , is observed .",
    "this method of sampling shares stochastic properties with incident subgraph sampling ( wherein the role of nodes and edges is reversed ) and with certain types of random walk sampling  @xcite .",
    "the problem of estimating degrees of sampled nodes has been given a formal statistical treatment in  @xcite , for the specific case of traceroute sampling as a special case of the so - called _ species problem _ @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , a similarly formal treatment has not been applied more generally for other , more canonical sampling strategies . however",
    ", a similar problem would be estimating personal network size for a group of people in a survey . some prior works in this direction @xcite consider estimators obtained by scaling up the observed degree in the sampled network , in the spirit of what we term a method of moments estimator below . but",
    "no specific graph sampling designs are discussed in these studies .",
    "we focus on formulating the problem using the induced subgraph sampling design and exploit network information beyond sampled degree to propose estimators that are better than naive scale - up estimators .",
    "key to our formulation is a risk theoretic framework used to derive our estimators of the node degrees , through minimizing frequentist or bayes risks .",
    "this contribution is accompanied by a comparative analysis of our proposed estimators and naive scale - up estimators , both theoretical and empirical , in several network regimes .",
    "we note that when sampling is coupled with false positive and false negative edges , e.g. , in certain biological networks , our methods are not immediately applicable .",
    "sampling designs that result in the selection of a fraction of edges from the underlying global network ( induced and incident subgraph sampling , random walks etc . ) are our primary objects of study .",
    "we use induced subgraph sampling as a rudimentary but representative model for this class and aim to simultaneously estimate the true degrees of all the observed nodes with a precision better than that obtained by trivial scale - up estimators with no network information used .",
    "let us denote by @xmath1 a true underlying network , where @xmath2 .",
    "this network is assumed static and , without loss of generality , undirected .",
    "the true degree vector is @xmath3 .",
    "the sampled network is denoted by @xmath4 where , again without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath5 . write the sampled degree vector as @xmath6 . throughout the paper , we assume that we have an induced subgraph sample , with ( known ) sampling proportion @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see from the sampling scheme that @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the method of moments estimator ( mme ) for @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "thus , @xmath10 is a natural scale - up estimator of the degree sequence of the sampled nodes . in this section",
    ", we propose a class of estimators that minimize the unweighted @xmath11-risk of the sampled degree vector and discuss their theoretical properties .",
    "we aim to demonstrate , under several conditions , that the risk minimizers are superior to the regular scale - up estimators , the former taking into account the inherent relationships inside the network .",
    "we note that although a maximum likelihood approach to estimation is perhaps intuitively appealing , a closed form derivation of the mle in this setting is probitive .",
    "another option is to look at marginal likelihoods .",
    "but the mle based on univariate marginal likelihoods are essentially equivalent to the mme for this sampling scheme .",
    "we will frequently use the the first and second moments of the sampled degree vector in our estimation methods .",
    "the following lemma will be useful .",
    "[ lem : meancovariancedegree ] under induced subgraph sampling , the mean and covariance matrix of the observed degree vector are @xmath12 where the diagonals of @xmath13 are @xmath14 and the @xmath15-th off - diagonal is denoted by @xmath16 , which denotes the number of common neighbors of node @xmath17 and node @xmath18 in the network @xmath19 .      adopting the standard definition of ( unweighted ) frequentist @xmath11 risk of an estimator @xmath20 of a parameter @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 ,",
    "the frequentist risks are calculated for a general class of estimators .",
    "we also define @xmath23 , a _ restricted risk function _ assuming the sampled graph @xmath24 is restricted to some class @xmath25 .",
    "our proposed candidates are the elements in the class of linear functions of the observed degree vector that minimize the risk or the restricted risk w.r.t . some class .",
    "it is expected that the optimal estimator will be a function of the parameter and hence another ( naive ) estimator will need to be plugged in . our final estimate will then be a plug - in risk minimizer .      here",
    "we estimate the node degrees individually , assuming that the estimate for the @xmath26 node is of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a scalar and @xmath29 is the observed degree in the sample . since @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the true degree of the @xmath26 node , @xmath30 differentiating w.r.t . @xmath28 and equating to 0 , we get the optimal @xmath31 . plugging in the mme of @xmath32",

    "we propose a bayesian solution to our estimation problem , by putting a prior on the degree distribution .",
    "the principal motivation behind this approach is the desire to incorporate additional information on global network structure , where the natural candidate in this context is the degree distribution . in case such",
    "a subjective prior is not available , an estimate of the degree distribution may be used .",
    "we propose and analyze estimators based on both known ( subjective ) and estimated degree distributions below .",
    "first , let us assume that we know the degree distribution @xmath62 of the underlying network",
    ". under the assumption that the true degree of node @xmath17 follows @xmath62 , and under induced subgraph sampling of @xmath63 , the conditional distribution of @xmath64 is @xmath65 .",

    "the weights are functionals of both sampling design and the degree distribution . for the latter estimator ,",
    "only the estimated degree distribution comes into play , and thus the proposed empirical bayes estimator incorporates the sampling and sampled network information .",
    "in this section , we present results on the relative performance of our proposed estimators from a risk - theoretic perspective , and we discuss several conditions under which one outperforms the other .",
    "all these estimates will be benchmarked against the regular scale - up estimate @xmath72 .",
    "proofs may be found in the supplementary materials .      in the first part of our risk analysis",
    ", we look at the @xmath11 frequentist risk of our proposed univariate and multivariate estimators",
    ". our main results in this section will compare the risk incurred by our proposed estimators to the scale up estimator and discuss conditions under which our proposed estimators perform better .",
    "[ unirisk ] assuming @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 .    in other words , the univariate risk minimizer @xmath75 will outperform the mme when the true degree @xmath8 is sufficiently large .",
    "[ multirisk ] let us denote the class of all sampled graphs of size @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 for all @xmath17 , i.e. , there is no isolated node ) as @xmath78 .",
    "also assume that there exists an @xmath79 such that @xmath80 are nonempty .",
    "then we have @xmath81 over sampled graphs belonging to @xmath82 .",
    "scrutiny of the conditions in proposition [ multirisk ] , along with definition of the set @xmath83 , reveals a general characterization of the graphs where the proposed multivariate estimator performs better .",
    "it is to be noticed that @xmath84 shrinks @xmath85 by some factor .",
    "the term on the right side of the inequality in the definition of @xmath86 provides a lower bound on the shrinkage factor and the term on the left decreases as the cardinality of @xmath87 increases , i.e. , the graph becomes less sparse .",
    "hence , the proposed estimator can be expected to work better than the standard scale - up estimator under the assumption of sparsity of the sampled graph .",
    "this will also be demonstrated in the simulation section .",
    "the eigenvector condition imposes a geometric constraint on the sample degree - degree matrix @xmath60 .",
    "what it essentially means is that the angle between the eigenvectors of @xmath88 and @xmath89 should be smaller than @xmath90 . or , in other words , by selecting an @xmath91 sufficiently small but positive , our class of sampled graphs are restricted where the associated matrix @xmath88 has eigenvectors at least @xmath92 angle away from any orthogonal direction to @xmath89 .",
    "thus , our estimator performs better for sparse graph satisfying a mild geometric condition .",
    "the performance of the bayes estimators is evaluated here under several conditions and network paradigms .",
    "note that these estimators are compared to the regular scale - up estimator with respect to their frequentist risk functions .",
    "we start with our estimator in its most general form and state conditions on the prior degree distribution that will ensure lower risk . from that , we assess its risk when the prior degree distribution is replaced with an appropriate estimate .",

    "then @xmath97 under induced subgraph sampling .    the conditions ( [ suffrisk : cond1 ] ) and ( [ suffrisk : cond2 ] ) essentially constrain the tail behavior of the prior degree disbution .",
    "the first condition ensures that the tail decays at a rate such that it is not too `` thick '' and the second condition ensures that it is not too `` thin '' . as @xmath8 becomes bigger , the rhs in condition ( [ suffrisk : cond1 ] ) becomes smaller and that is reminiscent of the sparsity property of the underlying graph , meaning that not a lot of nodes can have very high degree , an observation consistent with sparse graphs . on the other hand , the lhs in the condition ( [ suffrisk : cond2 ] )",
    "can be interpreted as the mean of the tail probabilities weighted by the posterior distribution .",
    "this has to be bounded away from zero in order for the bayes estimate to have lower risk than the mme .    in real problems , where the true degree distribution is unknown ,",
    "one either has to choose @xmath98 subjectively or use the data to come up with a reasonable estimate .",
    "estimating @xmath98 for a general case is beyond the scope of this paper and will not be discussed here . for our analysis",
    ", we will just assume that we have an estimate of the degree distribution at our disposal ( e.g. , @xcite ) , denoted by @xmath99 .",
    "using @xmath99 will give us our proposed empirical bayes estimate @xmath100 , the behavior of which can be described as follows .",
    "[ pluginapprox ] let @xmath67 be an estimate of @xmath62 such that @xmath101 then under assumption ( [ suffrisk : cond2 ] ) , with @xmath98 replaced by @xmath99 , we have @xmath102    it is easily seen that with the assumption , the upper bound in can be simplified to @xmath103 assuming a large network , the sum in the denominator can be approximated by @xmath104 .",
    "then the upper bound is @xmath105 from the above discussion , it is evident that if @xmath106 , @xmath107 for all @xmath17 and hence their risk functions will also be close .",
    "thus , using proposition [ suffrisk ] , it is expected that @xmath108      it is well known that the asymptotic degrees in erds - rnyi graph models follow a poisson distribution , under standard conditions . in this section ,",
    "we study the effects of using a poisson prior degree distribution for large erds - rnyi graphs .",
    "the goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of the bayesian approach compared to scale - up estimates as in the last section .",
    "however , studying specific models like erds - rnyi will give us more insight about the performance of the proposed bayes estimate .",
    "in this scenario , the prior @xmath62 is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the prior mean .",
    "for a large erds - rnyi graph with number of nodes @xmath111 and edge probability @xmath44 , @xmath112 .",
    "we denote , by @xmath113 , the shifted poisson distribution on @xmath114 whose p.m.f .",
    "is given by @xmath115 it is easy to check that with a @xmath116 prior on @xmath70 , the posterior distribution is @xmath117 .",
    "hence the bayes estimate with respect to the quadratic loss function is @xmath118    [ erdosbayesrisk ] assuming @xmath119 the quadratic risk of the bayes estimator using a @xmath116 prior is smaller than that of the mme .",
    "the above result shows that if the sampled node is such that its true degree belongs to a neighborhood around the mean of the underlying degree distribution , then the bayes estimator is uniformly better than the mme . in case",
    "the underlying mean is unknown , it can easily be estimated from the sample .",
    "( e.g. , for known @xmath111 , @xmath120 ) if @xmath121 is a consistent estimator of @xmath110 in the sense that @xmath122 when @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , then the empirical bayes estimator @xmath126 will converge in probability to the bayes estimator in the sense that @xmath127 .",
    "hence , the result of prop .",
    "( [ erdosbayesrisk ] ) is expected to hold .",
    "this will also be demonstrated in the simulations .",
    "for our simulation study , we look at two different regimes of network  erds - rnyi random graphs and heavy tailed degree distributions .      we compare four methods of estimation - the regular mme , univariate risk minimizer , multivariate risk minimizer and the bayes estimate . as priors in bayes estimation",
