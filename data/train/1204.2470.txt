    "the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite has important applications in many domains of physics .",
    "as it is well known , such equation arises in several different problems .",
    "a classical example is electronic transport in biomolecules @xcite . in the context of optics or acoustics",
    "it describes the propagation of nonlinear waves in a layered photonic or phononic system .",
    "indeed , in a suitable limit , the dynamics of high - frequency bloch waves is described by a dnls equation for their envelope ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) . on the other hand , in the realm of the physics of cold atomic gases ,",
    "the equation is an approximate semiclassical description of bosons trapped in periodic optical lattices ( see e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein for a recent survey ) .",
    "many other physical problems have been recently addressed having the dnls equation as a basic reference model , like the effect of nonlinearity on anderson localization @xcite and the violation of reciprocity in wave scattering @xcite just to mention a few recent examples .    while a vast literature has been devoted to localization problems , much less is known about finite - temperature properties .",
    "the first analysis of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of dnls systems has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the relaxation of localized modes ( discrete breathers ) in the presence of phonon baths has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "several results can be translated to other types of nonlinear lattices , where a dnls - like equation represents an approximation of the lattice dynamics  @xcite .",
    "an even less explored field is that of nonequilibrium properties of the dnls equation @xcite . in particular , the case of an open system that exchanges energy with external reservoirs has not been treated so far .",
    "the presence of two conserved quantitities naturally requires to argue about coupled transport , in the sense of ordinary linear irreversible thermodynamics . despite the very many studies of heat conduction in oscillator chains  @xcite , works on coupled transport are scarce  @xcite .",
    "interest in this field has been revived by recent works on thermoelectric phenomena  @xcite in the hope of identifying dynamical mechanisms that could enhance the efficiency of thermoelectric energy conversion  @xcite .    in order to investigate transport properties ,",
    "we need to introduce the interaction of the system with external reservoirs that are capable to exchange energy and/or norm . for models like dnls",
    "this is much less straightforward than for standard oscillator chains , where e.g. langevin thermostats are a typical choice @xcite .",
    "here we propose and test a very simple monte carlo scheme which is easy to implement and suitable for the model at hand .",
    "another important difference between the dnls and standard oscillator chains ( like the fermi - pasta - ulam or klein - gordon models ) is that its hamiltonian is not the sum of kinetic and potential energies .",
    "thus , it is necessary to introduce suitable operative definitions of kinetic temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 , to measure such quantities in actual simulations . in the following ,",
    "we make use of a recent definition of the microcanonical temperature @xcite and extend it for the estimate of the chemical potential .    by imposing small @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 jumps across the chain , we can determine the onsager coefficients , which turn out to be finite in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. both energy and mass conductions are normal processes .",
    "from the onsager coefficients we can thereby determine the  seebeck coefficient \" @xmath2 @xcite which we find to be either positive or negative , depending on the thermodynamic parameters ( i.e. , mass and energy density ) .",
    "for larger temperature or chemical - potential differences , although one can still invoke the linear response theory , some surprising phenomena emerge .",
    "one example is the  anomalous heating \" that can be observed when the chain is attached to two thermostats operating at the same temperature : along the chain , @xmath0 reaches values that are even three times larger than that imposed on the boundaries .",
    "this phenomenon can be observed only in the case of coupled transport , since it is due to the variable weight of the non - diagonal terms of the onsager matrix .",
    "it is apparent in the dnls , because of the strong variability of the onsager coefficients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : noneq ] we introduce the model and describe the heat baths . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we define the relevant thermodynamic observables and the formalism ( e.g. , the onsager coefficients ) necessary to characterize nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "[ sec : steady ] is devoted to a discussion of the stead states , both in the case of small and large @xmath0 , @xmath1 differences . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zero ] we provide a pictorial representation of the general transport properties , by reconstructing the zero - flux curves .",
    "finally , the last section is devoted to the conclusions and to a brief summary of the open problems .",
    "in one dimension , the dnls hamiltonian writes @xmath3 where the sum runs over the @xmath4 sites of the chain .",
    "the sign of quartic term is positive , as we refer to a repulsive - atom bec , while the sign of the hopping term is irrelevant , due to the symmetry associated with the canonical ( gauge ) transformation @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 denotes the amplitude of the wave function ) . the equations of motion are @xmath7 with @xmath8 , and fixed boundary conditions ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the model has two conserved quantities , the energy and the total norm ( or total number of particles ) @xmath10 as a consequence , the equilibrium phase - diagram is two - dimensional , as it involves the energy density @xmath11 and the particle density @xmath12 .",
    "the first reconstruction of the diagram was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite within the grand - canonical ensemble with the help of transfer integral techniques .",
    "it is schematically described in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : the lower dashed line corresponds to the ground state ( @xmath13 ) upon varying the particle density ; the upper dashed line corresponds to infinite temperature .",

    "the three ( blue ) dashed lines are the isothermal @xmath13 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",

    "the implementaton of the interactions with a heat bath is often based on heuristics . in particle models ,",
    "the simpler schemes consist in either adding a langevin noise , or in assuming random collisions with an equilibrium gas @xcite .",
    "for the dnls this is less straightforward : adding white noise and a linear dissipation drives the system to infinite temperature , i.e. to a state in which relative phases are uncorrelated .    in the absence of a first - principle definition of heat bath , we consider two phenomenological monte - carlo heat baths .",
    "the general scheme of this kind of heat bath involves a stochastic dynamics which perturbs the canonical variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite at random times , chosen according to a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the perturbations @xmath31 and @xmath32 are independent random variables uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "moves are accepted according to the standard metropolis algorithm , evaluating the cost function @xmath34 with @xmath24 and @xmath26 being the temperature and the chemical potential of the heat bath .",
    "this kind of thermostat exchanges both energy and particles . in some cases , however , we need to study the chain behavior in the absence of one of the two fluxes ( energy and norm ) . a simple way to study these setups is to modify the perturbation rule of the thermostat , requiring the exact conservation of the corresponding local density ( energy density or norm density ) .",
    "we have thus the following two schemes :    _ norm conserving thermostat- _ the perturbation acts only on the phase @xmath35 of the complex variable @xmath36 . more precisely we impose @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a random variable , uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "this dynamics conserves exactly the local amplitude @xmath40 and therefore the total norm @xmath41 .",
    "_ energy conserving thermostat- _ in this case , it is necessary to go through two steps to conserve the energy @xmath42 first , the amplitude @xmath43 is randomly perturbed . as a result , both the local amplitude and the local energy change .",
    "then , by inverting , eq .",
    "( [ e_dens ] ) , a value of @xmath44 that restores the initial energy is seeked .",
    "if no such solution exists , we go back to the first step and choose a new perturbation for @xmath43 .",
    "there is a basic difference between the two types of thermostats . in the general scheme , a steady state",
    "is characterized by four parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 . on the other hand , for the norm - conserving scheme",
    "we only assign @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the norm density @xmath45 of the whole chain . as a consequence ,",
    "the value of @xmath1 on the boundary is not fixed and must be computed from the simulation . if the steady state is unique , the former thermostating scheme must yield the same results , once the chemical potentials are suitably fixed .",
    "a numerical test of this equivalence has been performed , by reconstructing some zero - flux profiles with both thermostats .",
    "the curves overlap reasonably well , although some small systematic deviations are present .",
    "this is because the norm flux is never exactly zero in the non - conservative case ( typically of order @xmath46 in a chain of 1000 sites ) .",
    "in addition , there are slightly different thermal resistance effects in the two schemes .",
    "besides those discrepancies , we conclude that the proposed schemes work equally well for the generation of nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "in order to characterize the thermodynamic properties of the dnls , we extend the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to derive an operative definition not only of the microcanonical temperature but also of the chemical potential .",
    "the starting point are the usual definitions @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the thermodynamic entropy .",
    "the partial derivatives must be computed taking into account the existence of two conserved quantities ( hereafter called @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",

    "nevertheless , we have verified that it is sufficient to compute the expression ( [ tdnlse ] ) over as few as 10 sites to obtain , after some time averaging , reliable `` local '' estimates of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .    the expressions for the local energy- and particle - fluxes are derived in the usual way from the continuity equations for norm and energy densities , respectively @xmath61 the approach to the steady state is controlled by verifying that the ( time ) average fluxes are constant along the chain ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) . moreover it is also checked that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are respectively equal to the average energy and norm exchanged per unit time with the reservoirs .    as usual in nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations , some tuning of the bath parameters",
    "is required to minimize boundary resistance and decrease the statistical errors , as well as the finite - size effects @xcite . for our monte - carlo thermostats",
    ", we observed that it is necessary to tune the perturbation amplitude @xmath66 .",
    "typically , there is an optimal value of @xmath66 for which one of the two currents is maximal ( keeping the other parameters fixed ) , but this value may depend on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "since it would be unpractical to tune the thermostat parameters in each simulation , we decided to fix them in most of the cases .",
    "in particular we have chosen @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "some adjustments have been made only when the fluxes were very small .    in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. for sufficiently long chains ) , the local forces acting on the system are very weak and one can thereby invoke the linear response theory .",

    "in a first series of simulations we have studied the nonequilibrium states in the case of small differences between the two thermostats , verifying that transport is normal , i.e. the onsager coefficients are finite in the thermodynamic limit . this is less obvious than one could have imagined @xcite . in any case , for fixed @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the two fluxes @xmath64 and @xmath65 are inversely proportional to the system size @xmath4 . at high enough temperatures , the asymptotic scaling sets in already in chains a few hundred sites long ( see fig .",

    "as the particle density @xmath106 increases with @xmath1 this also implies that @xmath106 may be larger in the colder regions .",
    "furthermore , a remakable feature of the dnls thermodynamics is the possibility of negative temperatures states in suitable parameter regions  @xcite .",
    "these regions , that are characterized by the presence of long - lived localized excitations ( discrete breathers ) , have not be considered in the present paper , but are definitely worth being explored . it may be indeed speculated that they would lead to genuine nonlinear transport features and even to the birth of new dynamical regimes possibly displaying transitions between conducting and insulating states .",
    "besides its intrinsic theoretical interest as a testbed for the characterization of coupled irreversible processes , the dnls equation opens the way also to experimental investigations .",
    "in fact , despite its mathematical simplicity , the dnls model can be of guidance in the design and interpretation of experiments on coupled - transport in cold atomic gases in deep optical lattices as well as in optical multilayered and nonlinear structures .",
    "with a slight abuse of terminology , we use the language of thermoelectric phenomena , even though the underlying physical process is thermodiffusion , since particles have no electric charge in the dnls context .",
    "in general , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 contain additional terms @xmath166 and @xmath167 that can , however , be neglected . in the dnls case",
    ", it can be proven that @xmath168 , while simulations indicate that @xmath169 but also that @xmath170 .",
    "indeed , the value of @xmath1 computed ignoring @xmath167 coincides with the expected value when @xmath171 , @xmath172 . in any case , even in a nonequilibrium setup , @xmath1 must be computed on sufficiently long subchains .",
    "this choice is particularly delicate for small nonlinearities and low temperatures .",
    "for instance , for @xmath173 subchains of at least @xmath174 sites are needed ."
