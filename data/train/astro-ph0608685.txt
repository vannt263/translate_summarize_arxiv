    "superclusters are collections of galaxy groups and clusters that represent the largest , gravitationally bound structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "if the dark energy is a cosmological constant , then the collapse of these systems over the next few billion years of the cosmic future will mark the end of hierarchical structure formation in our universe @xcite .",
    "a conspicuous feature of locally observed superclusters is the strong tendency of member clusters to be elongated in their major axis orientations @xcite , which is in turn closely related to their filamentary shapes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to describe the structure distribution on the largest scale in the universe , it will be quite essential to understand this effect of cluster - supercluster alignments from first principles .",
    "the effect of structure - substructure alignment is in fact observed on all different scales in the universe . on the subgalactic scale the galaxy satellites are observed to be located preferentially near the major axes of their host galaxies @xcite . on the galactic scale the major axes of cluster galaxies are observed to be aligned with that of their host clusters @xcite .",
    "the cluster galaxies are also observed to have a strong tendency toward radial alignment @xcite .",
    "although this alignment effect has been shown to be a natural outcome in the currently favored concordance @xmath4cdm cosmology @xcite , its detailed origin remains a subject of debate between those who emphasize the importance of anisotropic merging and those who stress tidal interaction .",
    "the anisotropic merging scenario explains that the effect of substructure - structure alignment is induced by the anisotropic merging and infall of matter along filaments @xcite .",
    "it was indeed shown by n - body simulations that the merging and infall of matter to form bound halos indeed occur preferentially along filaments , which provided supporting evidences for this scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the tidal interaction theory explains that the correlations between the substructure angular momentum vectors and the principal axes of the host tidal fields induce the alignment effect .",
    "@xcite constructed an analytic model for the effect of substructure alignment in the frame of the tidal interaction theory , and showed that their analytic predictions are in good agreement with the numerical results from n - body simulations .",
    "in fact , the above two theories are not mutually exclusive since the anisotropic merging and infall itself is a manifestation of the primordial tidal field @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two scenarios , however , lies in the question of whether the connection to filaments is a major contribution or not .",
    "very recently , @xcite have quantified the influences of both the tidal interaction and the anisotropic infall through the analysis of data from recent high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "what they confirmed is the following : ( i ) for the majority of halos the alignment effect is caused by the tidal field but not by the anisotropic infall ; ( ii ) only for the cluster - size halos the alignment effect is dominantly due to the anisotropic merging and infall of matter along filaments . in other words , they made it clear that the filaments are important marker of local orientations on the cluster halo scale .",
    "now that the cluster - supercluster alignment turns out to be due to the anisotropic merging along filaments , it is desirable to have a theoretical frame work within which one can provide physical answers to the remaining questions such as how the alignment effect depends on the cluster properties such as mass , shape , and etc . our goal here is to construct such a theoretical framework by using both analytical and numerical methods .",
    "analytically we adopt the standard cosmic web theory , and numerically we use the large hubble volume simulation data .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in @xmath5",
    "we provide a brief description of the hubble volume simulation and summarize the numerical results . in @xmath6",
    "we present an analytic model and compare its predictions with the numerical results .",
    "in @xmath7 we discuss our results and draw final conclusions .",
    "for the numerical analysis , we use a mass - limited sample of cluster halos extracted from the hubble volume simulation of a @xmath4cdm universe @xcite . the simulation models dark matter structure resolved by particles of mass @xmath8 in a periodic cube of linear size @xmath9mpc , assuming @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12 catalog contains a total of @xmath13 halos with mass above a limiting value @xmath14 , with information on various properties such as center - of - mass position , mass , inertia momentum tensor , and redshift .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite and @xcite for the details of the cluster catalog , including the algorithm of cluster identification .",
    "the superclusters are identified in the catalog with the help of the friends - of - friends algorithm with the linking length of @xmath15 , where @xmath16mpc is the mean spacing of the mass - limited sample . the total number and the mean mass of the identified superclusters are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "this large number of superclusters allows us to study the alignment effect with high statistical power .    figure  [ fig : sc3 ] shows orthogonal projections of the third richest supercluster in the volume .",
    "it contains 12 halos above the applied mass limit , and a total mass of @xmath19 associated with these halos .",
    "the spatial distribution of the supercluster is highly elongated , much closer to filamentary than spherical . in this example , the major axis orientations of the halos , taken from @xcite , are shown as whiskers in the plot . the tendency for these halos to be aligned with their supercluster s principal axis , although arguably visible in this plot , is a weak effect .",
    "we therefore seek a statistical measure using the entire supercluster sample .    for each supercluster , we measure its inertia momentum tensor , @xmath20 , as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the mass and the position of the @xmath24-th member cluster , respectively and @xmath25 is the total mass of the host supercluster .",
    "then , we compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors through the diagonalization of @xmath26 and determine the major - axis direction as the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue .",
    "it is , however , worth mentioning here that for a supercluster which has less than five clusters , the orientation of its major axis derived using equation ( [ eqn : ine ] ) must suffer from considerable inaccuracy .",
    "the most idealistic way should be to derive the major axis of a supercluster using all particles within it .    nevertheless , given that the major axes of the superclusters in real observations can not be determined by this idealistic way since the positions of the dark matter particles are not measurable , the advantage of our analysis based ( eq.[[eqn : ine ] ] ) is its practicality .",
    "that is , it can be readily repeated by observers based directly on cluster catalogs .    at any rate , to overcome the limitation of our analysis based on equation ( [ eqn : ine ] , we construct a separate sample choosing only those superclusters which have more than five clusters ( @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of clusters within the superclusters ) . it is found that @xmath29 superclusters have more than five clusters and total @xmath30 clusters belong to those @xmath29 superclusters .",
    "first , we measure the probability distribution of the cosines of the angles , @xmath31 , between the major axes of the superclusters and their member clusters",
    ". figure [ fig : dis ] plots the result as solid dots with poisson errors .",
    "the upper panel corresponds to the case that all the @xmath32 superclusters are used , while the lower panel corresponds to the case that only those superclusters with more than five clusters are used .",
    "the dotted line in each panel corresponds to the case of no alignment .",
    "as can be seen , the distribution , @xmath33 , increases with @xmath31 in the both panels , revealing a clear signal of alignment effect .",
    "although the result of the lower panel shows less sharp increase , suffering from large errors , the signal is robust at the @xmath34 confidence level .",
    "it indicates that the cluster - supercluster alignment effect is not a false signal originated from the inaccurate derivation of the supercluster major axes but a real one .",
    "the mean value of @xmath31 is found to be @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the upper and the lower panels , respectively .",
    "now that a robust signal of cluster - supercluster alignment effect is found , we examine how the degree of the alignment depends on the cluster properties .",
    "first , we examine how the average of @xmath31 depends on the cluster mass , @xmath37 .",
    "figure [ fig : mas ] plots the result versus the rescaled cluster mass , @xmath38 , as solid dots with errors which are calculated as one standard deviation of @xmath31 for the case of no alignment . as can be seen in the upper panel , the degree of alignment increases with @xmath39 .",
    "a similar trend is also shown in the lower panel although it suffers from the large errors .",
    "second , we examine how the average of @xmath31 depends on the separation distance , @xmath2 , from the supercluster center to the cluster center .",
    "figure [ fig : sep ] plots the result versus the rescaled distance , @xmath40 as solid dots with errors . as can be seen in the upper panel , the degree of the alignment decreases with distance .",
    "that is , the closer a cluster is located to the supercluster center , the more stronger the alignment effect is .",
    "third , we examine how the average of @xmath31 depends on the cluster ellipticity , @xmath1 . here , we define the ellipticity of a cluster as @xmath41 assuming a prolate cluster shape , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the cluster inertia momentum tensor , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : ell ] plots the result versus the rescaled ellipticity , @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the maximum cluster ellipticity ) as solid dots with errors , which reveals that the degree of alignment increases with cluster ellipticity .",
    "that is , the more elongated a cluster is , the more stronger the alignment effect is .",
    "fourth , we measure the average of @xmath31 as a function of the cluster velocity , @xmath3 . figure [ fig : vel ] plots the result with solid dots with errors , which reveals that the degree of alignment depends very weakly on the cluster velocity .",
    "we provide physical explanations for these numerical results in @xmath6 .",
    "to construct an analytic model for the cluster - supercluster alignment effect , we assume the following .    1 .   a supercluster forms through anisotropic merging of clusters along filaments . in consequence ,",
    "the major axis of a supercluster tends to be in the direction of the dominant filament .",
    "a filament is defined as one dimensional object collapsed along the major and intermediate principal axes of the local tidal tensor @xcite .",
    "the direction of a filament thereby is aligned with the minor principal axis of the tidal tensor .",
    "therefore , the major axis of a supercluster tends to be in the direction of the minor principal axis of the tidal tensor .",
    "2 .   let @xmath46 be the tidal tensor field smoothed on the supercluster mass scale , and let also @xmath47 be the linear density contrast of the supercluster where @xmath48 is the mean mass density .",
    "let also @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 ) be the three eigenvalues of @xmath46 .",
    "the collapse condition for a supercluster is given as @xmath51 given that the supercluster passes the moment of turn - around but not yet virialized , we expect its linear density contrast , @xmath52 , to be in the range @xmath53 where the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 correspond to the linear densities at the moments of the turn - around and the virialization , respectively @xcite . here",
    ", we choose a fiducial value of @xmath56 .",
    "the other condition , @xmath57 in equation ( [ eqn : sup ] ) represents the collapse along filaments @xcite .",
    "3 .   the cluster - supercluster alignment is a reflection of the anisotropic spatial distribution of cluster galaxies in a filament - dominant web - like cosmic structure .",
    "the correlation of the spatial positions of galaxies with the local tidal field can be quantified by the following quadratic equation which was first suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the rescaled major axis of a galaxy cluster and the unit tidal shear tensor smoothed on the supercluster mass scale , @xmath25 . here , the parameter , @xmath61 $ ] , represents the strength of the correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath46 . if @xmath63 , there is the strongest correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 , there is the strongest anti - correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath64 . while if @xmath66 , there is no correlation between them .",
    "the conditional probability distribution of @xmath62 provided that the local tidal field is given as @xmath46 can be approximated as gaussian @xcite : @xmath67^{1/2 } } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^{c}_{i}(m^{-1})_{ij}x^{c}_{j}}{2}\\right],\\ ] ] where the covariance matrix @xmath68 is related to @xmath64 by equation ( [ eqn : corr ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning here the difference of the cluster - supercluster alignment from the galaxy - cluster alignment . for the former case ,",
    "the primordial tidal field induces the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of galaxies along cosmic filaments , which results in the alignment between the major axes of clusters and their superclusters . for the latter case",
    ", the tidal field of a virialized cluster halo induces the angular momentum of the cluster galaxies whose minor axes tend to be aligned with the major axis of its host cluster @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the alignments between the major axes of cluster galaxies and their host clusters are related to the generation of the angular momentum while the alignments between the major axes of clusters and their host superclusters related to the filamentary distribution of galaxies .      using the four hypotheses given in @xmath69 ,",
    "we derive first @xmath33 analytically . according to the second hypothesis",
    ", it amounts to deriving the probability density distribution of the cosines of the angles between the major axes of clusters and the minor principal axes of the local tidal tensors .",
    "let us express @xmath62 in terms of the spherical polar coordinates in the principal axis frame of @xmath46 as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the polar and the azimuthal angles of @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "then , the polar angle , @xmath72 , is nothing but the angle between @xmath62 and the minor principal axis of @xmath46 .",
    "now , the probability density distribution of @xmath31 can be derived by integrating equation ( [ eqn : xdis ] ) over @xmath74 and @xmath73 as @xmath75 , which leads to @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the unit eigenvalues of @xmath78 related to @xmath79 as @xmath80 .",
    "it was in fact @xcite who first derived equation ( [ eqn : theta_dis ] ) as an analytic expression for the probability distribution of the alignments between the positions of the galaxy satellites in the major axis orientations of their host galaxies .",
    "here , we derive it as an analytic expression for the probability distribution of the alignments between the major axes of clusters and their host superclusters .",
    "it is important to note a key difference between the two cases . for the case of galaxy satellites , it is the tidal fields of the _ virialized _ galactic halos that causes the alignment effect",
    ". therefore , all the eigenvalues , @xmath81 in equation ( [ eqn : theta_dis ] ) should be positive . whereas for the case of clusters in superclusters it is the local filaments which collapse along only two principal axes of the primordial local tidal tensors .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 in equation ( [ eqn : theta_dis ] ) has a negative value .    the probability distribution , @xmath33 ( eq.[[eqn : theta_dis ] ] )",
    "is characterized by three independent parameters , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "once the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are determined , then the negative value of @xmath82 is automatically determined by equation ( [ eqn : sup ] ) .",
    "since the values of these three parameters depend on the properties of individual superclusters as well as the local conditions of the initial tidal fields , it may be quite difficult to determine them analytically .    instead , we determine their average values by fitting equation ( [ eqn : theta_dis ] ) to the numerical results obtained in @xmath5 .",
    "when the numerical result using all superclusters are fitted , the best - fit values of the three parameters are found to be @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , which gives @xmath91 .",
    "when the numerical result using only those superclusters with @xmath92 are fitted , it is found interestingly that the best - fit values of the parameters are @xmath93 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "note that the two numerical cases yield the same best - fit values for @xmath86 and @xmath87 although the best - fit values of the correlation parameters are different as @xmath94 and @xmath93 .",
    "figure [ fig : dis ] plots the analytic distributions with these best - fit parameters ( solid line ) and compares it with the numerical data points . in the upper panel , the analytic distribution with @xmath94",
    "is compared with the numerical result obtained in @xmath5 using all superclusters , while in the lower panel the analytic distribution with @xmath93 is compared with the numerical result obtained using only those superclusters with more than five clusters @xmath95 ) . as can be seen , the analytic and the numerical results are in good agreement with each other in the both panels .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the best - fit values of the three parameters are subject to our fiducial choice of @xmath56 .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath69 , there is no consensus on the critical linear density of the superclusters unlike the case of clusters .",
    "varying the value of @xmath52 from @xmath96 to @xmath55 , we have repeated the fitting procedure , and we found that although the best - fit values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 change by maximum @xmath97 , the fitting result itself does not sensitively change with the value of @xmath52 .",
    "thus , it is concluded that our fiducial model is a stable choice .",
    "now that we have the probability density distribution , @xmath33 , we would like to find an analytic expression for @xmath98 as a function of cluster mass , position , ellipticity , and velocity .",
    "the dependence of the correlation parameter @xmath83 on the cluster mass @xmath0 may be obtained by considering the difference in mass between the cluster and its host supercluster .",
    "strictly speaking , equation ( [ eqn : corr ] ) is valid when the tidal tensor @xmath46 and the position vector @xmath62 are smoothed on the same mass scale . in other words ,",
    "the correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath46 is expected to be highest when the two smoothing mass scales are the same . in reality , however , @xmath46 is smoothed on the supercluster mass scale @xmath25 while @xmath62 is smoothed on the cluster mass scale @xmath37 .",
    "the difference between the two mass scales diminishes the correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath99 be the value of the correlation parameter when the tidal field is smoothed on the same cluster mass scale , @xmath100 .",
    "we expect @xmath101 .",
    "given equation ( [ eqn : corr ] ) , we approximate @xmath102 as @xmath103 here , @xmath104 and @xmath105 represent the rms linear density fluctuations smoothed on the mass scales of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively . in deriving equation([eqn : sm ] ) we use the approximation of @xmath108 , which was proved to be valid by @xcite .",
    "now that the functional form of @xmath109 is found , the average of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath39 can be calculated by equations ( [ eqn : theta_dis ] ) and ( [ eqn : sm ] ) as @xmath110d\\!\\cos\\theta.\\ ] ] figure [ fig : mas ] plots equation ( [ eqn : mas ] ) with @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( solid line ) , and compares it with the numerical result ( dots ) obtained in @xmath5 . for the analytic distribution , the value of @xmath25",
    "is set to be the mean mass of the superclusters found in @xmath5 : @xmath111 ( upper panel ) ; @xmath112 ( lower panel ) .",
    "as can be seen , in the upper panel the analytic and the numerical results agree with each other excellently . in the lower panel , although the numerical result suffers from large errors , the analytic prediction is still quite consistent with the numerical result .",
    "the dependence of the correlation parameter , @xmath83 , on the distance , @xmath2 , between the centers of clusters and their host superclusters can be obtained in a similar way .",
    "the correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath46 in equation ( [ eqn : corr ] ) becomes strongest when @xmath113 . in reality , however , @xmath2 always deviates from zero , which will diminish the correlation strength .",
    "let @xmath114 be the value of the correlation parameter when @xmath113 , which is expected again to be @xmath115 . with a similar approximation made for equation ( [ eqn : sm ] )",
    ", we find the following formula for @xmath116 : @xmath117 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}s_{r0}\\left[1 + \\tilde{\\xi}_{c}(r)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath118 represents the two point density correlation rescaled to satisfy @xmath119 .",
    "since the distance @xmath2 is a eulerian quantity unlike the mass @xmath25 , we use the eulerian filtering radius of @xmath120mpc , the typical cluster size , to convolve the correlation function @xmath121 . here",
    ", the factor of @xmath122 comes from the average decreases of the correlation parameter due to the mass difference between the clusters and their host superclusters .",
    "now that the functional form @xmath116 is found , the average of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath2 can be calculated through equations ( [ eqn : theta_dis ] ) and ( [ eqn : sr ] ) as @xmath123d\\!\\cos\\theta.\\ ] ] figure [ fig : sep ] plots equation ( [ eqn : sep ] ) ( solid line ) as a function of the rescaled distance , @xmath40 , and compares it with the numerical result ( dots ) obtained in @xmath5 .",

    "numerical fitting is used to determine the functional form of @xmath126 .",

    "note that the value of @xmath45 is not fixed but sample - dependent . here , the millennium run data we use yields @xmath134 .",
    "but , a different sample could yield a different value of @xmath45 .",
    "now that the functional form of @xmath131 is found , the average of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath135 can be calculated by equations ( [ eqn : theta_dis ] ) and ( [ eqn : se ] ) as @xmath136d\\!\\cos\\theta.\\ ] ] the comparison between the analytic result ( eq.[[eqn : ell ] ] ) and the numerical data points shows good consistency , as seen in fig .

    ", no strong dependence is expected in our model since the primordial tidal field is uncorrelated with the velocity field @xcite .",
    "therefore , we model it as an uniform distribution as @xmath137 . the average value , @xmath98 is found to be @xmath35 when @xmath94 ( upper panel ) while it is @xmath36 when @xmath93 ( lower panel ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] , the analytic and the numerical results are consistent with each other .",
    "in the context of the standard cosmic web picture of large - scale structure , we have constructed a parametric model for the alignment of cluster - sized halos with their host superclusters .",
    "the underlying assumption is that cluster - supercluster alignment reflects the spatial distribution of matter as it is organized along filamentary structures by the primordial tidal field .",
    "the parameters of the analytic model represent the dominance of filaments and the spatial coherence of the initial tidal field .",
    "we show that the analytic model provides a good fit to orientation data derived from mass - limited halo samples of a @xmath4cdm hubble volume simulation . after fitting the three free parameters using the overall distribution of cluster - supercluster alignment angles ,",
    "the model then simultaneously matches the behavior of the mean alignments as a function of relative mass , cluster position within the supercluster , and cluster ellipticity .",
    "no trend with cluster velocity is predicted or measured in the simulation .",
    "it is worth discussing a couple of simplified assumptions on which our theoretical model is based .",
    "first , we have used the fof algorithm to identify superclusters in the n - body simulation data . unlike the case of virialized clusters , however , there is no established consensus on how to define superclusters .",
    "different supercluster - identification algorithms could result in different multiplicity , mass , and shape of superclusters which would in turn affect our results .",
    "second , we have assumed that the filaments correspond to the lagrangian regions where only the largest and the second largest eigenvalues of the local tidal tensor are positive .",
    "although this definition of a filament is consistent with the picture of the zeldovich approximation , it is obviously an oversimplification of the reality . a more realistic definition and treatment of cosmic filaments",
    "will be necessary to refine the model .",
    "another issue that we would like to discuss here is the possibility of using the cluster - supercluster alignment effect as a cosmological probe .",
    "we have shown that the phenomena of cluster - supercluster alignments are closely related to the dominance of filaments , the web - like distribution of galaxies on very large scales .",
    "the dominance of filaments is in turn related to the spatial correlations of the primordial tidal field , which depends sensitively on the slope of the initial power spectrum on the supercluster scale .",
    "thus , by measuring the degree of cluster - supercluster alignment , it might be possible to constrain the slope of the initial power spectrum in a complementary way .",
    "finally , we conclude that our model for the cluster - supercluster alignments will provide a theoretical framework within which the distribution of cosmic structures on the largest scales can be physically understood and quantitatively described .",

    "<S> we study correlations in spatial orientation between galaxy clusters and their host superclusters using a hubble volume n - body realization of a concordance cosmology and an analytic model for tidally - induced alignments . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an analytic form for distributions of the alignment angle as functions of halo mass ( @xmath0 ) , ellipticity ( @xmath1 ) , distance ( @xmath2 ) and velocity ( @xmath3 ) and show that the model , after tuning of three parameters , provides a good fit to the numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters indicate a high degree of alignment along anisotropic , collapsed filaments . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of alignment increases with @xmath0 and @xmath1 while it decreases with @xmath2 and is independent of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we note the possibility of using the cluster - supercluster alignment effect as a cosmological probe to constrain the slope of the initial power spectrum . </S>"
