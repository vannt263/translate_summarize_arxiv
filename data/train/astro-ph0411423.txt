    "the current observed sample of galactic black - hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) provides us with a unique opportunity for understanding the formation of black holes in binaries . in recent years",
    "the sample has grown significantly , reaching 18 bh xrbs identified through dynamical mass measurements ( orosz 2004 , mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) . for these systems there exists a wealth of observational information about their current physical state : bh and donor masses , orbital period , donor s position on the h - r diagram and surface chemical composition , transient or persistent and roche - lobe overflow ( rlo ) or wind - driven character of the mass - transfer ( mt ) process , and distances .",
    "even more recently proper motions have been measured for a handful of these systems ( mirabel et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; mirabel & rodrigues 2003a ) , complementing the earlier measurements of center - of - mass radial velocities and giving us information about the 3-dimensional kinematic properties of these binaries .",
    "similar information exists for some of the known xrbs with neutron star ( ns ) accretors ( ankay et al .",
    "2001 ; rib et al . 2002 ; mirabel & rodrigues 2003b ; mirabel , rodrigues , & liu 2004 ) .",
    "understanding the events of compact object formation in these known systems requires that we investigate their evolutionary history from the present state back to the time just prior to the core collapse event . in what follows",
    "we describe how the currently available observational constraints for xrbs can be used to uncover this past history and provide us with a consistent picture for how the bhs and nss were formed .",
    "the ultimate goal of this project is to examine the systematics of the derived compact object progenitor masses and requirements for supernova ( sn ) kicks and their dependence on compact object masses and associated mass loss at the core collapse events .",
    "such a comprehensive investigation will not just reveal the origin of these galactic xrbs , but may also offer insight to the physics of supernovae and the possible association of natal kicks with bh formation .    although this is not the first study that has considered the evolutionary history of known xrbs in the galaxy ( see , e.g. , de kool , van den heuvel , & pylyser 1987 ; brandt , podsiadlowski , & sigurdsson 1995 ; nelemans , tauris , & van den heuvel 1999 ; podsiadlowski , rappaport , & pfahl 2002a ; podsiadlowski , rappaport , & han 2003 ; gualandris et al .",
    "2004 ) , it is the first one that incorporates such a large number of observational constraints for a whole sample of systems and considers the complete set of evolutionary processes from the present back to the binary stage right before compact object formation .    in this first of a series of papers , we focus on a detailed description of our analysis methodology and the rationale for combining the current constraints to complete a self - consistent picture for the evolutionary history .",
    "we also focus on the computational methods used and the uncertainties involved , and apply our analysis to the well - studied soft x - ray transient groj1655 - 40 ( nova sco 1994 ) . in subsequent papers we will present our results for the rest of bh xrbs and for the ns xrbs with all the above constraints available .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly review the currently available constraints on the properties of the soft x - ray transient groj1655 - 40 . a general outline of the analysis used to reconstruct the system s evolutionary history is presented in  3 , while the individual steps of the analysis are discussed in more detail in  47 . in  8 ,",
    "we combine these steps and derive constraints on the binary s pre - sn orbital separation , on the mass of the bh s helium star progenitor , and on the kick velocity that may have been imparted to the bh at birth . in  9 ,",
    "hydrodynamic core - collapse simulations are presented and the nature of the bh progenitor is constrained even further .",
    "the final section is devoted to a discussion of our results and some concluding remarks .",

    "( 1995a ) . shortly thereafter ,",

    "the distance of groj1655 - 40 from the sun , finally , was determined by hjellming & rupen ( 1995 ) using a kinematic model for the jets of the system .",
    "they derived @xmath37kpc , which is in excellent agreement with previous distance estimates by mckay & kesteven ( 1994 ) , tingay et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and bailyn et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "more recently greene , bailyn , & orosz ( 2001 ) and beer & podsiadlowski ( 2002 ) have undertaken detailed studies of the ellipsoidal light variations when the system is in quiescence and derived rather different constraints for the two component masses and the position of the donor in the h - r diagram .",
    "greene et al . ( 2001 ) ( hereafter gbo ) used spherical nextgen atmosphere models for a fixed effective temperature of 6336k ( corresponding to a spectral type of f6iii ) to model the observed b , v , i , j , k light curves without any contribution from an accretion disk surrounding the bh .",
    "the model depends on two free parameters : the mass ratio @xmath38 , where @xmath20 is the mass of the bh and @xmath23 the mass of the companion , and the orbital inclination @xmath39 .",
    "as additional constraints , gbo used the radial - velocity curve derived by shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and the projected rotational velocity @xmath40 derived by israelian et al .",
    "the authors found a bh mass @xmath41 .",
    "beer & podsiadlowski ( 2002 ) ( hereafter bp ) fitted the ellipsoidal light variations in the photometric b- , v- , r- , and i - bands using kurucz models for the atmosphere of the roche - lobe filling secondary and a bh accretion disk model with a flat temperature profile .",
    "their model is characterised by five free parameters : the mass ratio @xmath38 , the orbital inclination @xmath39 , the polar temperature @xmath42 of the donor star , the color excess @xmath43 , and the distance @xmath5 from the sun .",
    "they furthermore adopted the distance of @xmath44kpc derived by hjellming & rupen ( 1995 ) as an additional ad - hoc constraint to further tighten the limits on the derived model parameters . in their best - fitting model ,",
    "bp found @xmath45 .    at present",
    "it does not seem clear which of the two analyses ( gbo or bp ) yields the most reliable measurements ( see also shahbaz 2003 ) . in this study",
    "we therefore consider both sets of constraints and study them as two separate cases .",
    "an overview of all observationally inferred properties of groj1655 - 40 relevant to this investigation is presented in table  [ 1655param ] . in particular , these properties are the distance @xmath5 from the sun , the galactic longitude @xmath7 and the galactic latitude @xmath9 , the center - of - mass velocity components @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and @xmath15 with respect to a galactic frame of reference , the orbital period @xmath17 , the bh mass @xmath20 , the donor mass @xmath23 , the donor luminosity @xmath26 , and the donor effective temperature @xmath29 .",
    "according to our current understanding , the formation of a bh xrb with a low- to intermediate - mass donor star requires a primordial binary with an extreme mass ratio and a primary ( the bh progenitor ) mass in excess of @xmath46 .",
    "if the period of the primordial binary is in the range from @xmath47 to @xmath48yr , the primary is expected to become larger than its critical roche lobe and , due to the extreme mass ratio , lose most of its hydrogen - rich envelope in a dynamically unstable common - envelope phase . provided that enough energy is available to completely expel the envelope and avoid a merger , the common - envelope phase results in the formation of a tight binary consisting of a helium star ( the core of the roche - lobe filling primary ) and a relatively unevolved low- to intermediate - mass main - sequence ( ms ) companion .",
    "a bh xrb is then formed when the helium star collapses into a bh and stellar evolution and/or orbital angular momentum losses ( or exchange through tides ) cause the secondary in its turn to fill its roche lobe and transfer mass to the bh .",
    "this formation channel is analogous to that usually considered for the formation of ns xrbs and has been considered previously by , e.g. , romani ( 1996 ) , portegies zwart , verbunt , & ergma ( 1997 ) , ergma & van den heuvel ( 1998 ) , kalogera ( 1999 ) , and podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the formation of bh xrbs through the above `` standard '' evolutionary channel and do not consider alternative formation channels involving hierarchical triple star interactions ( eggleton & verbunt 1986 ) or tidal capture or exchange events in dense stellar environments ( clark 1975 , hills 1976 ) .",
    "hence , we assume the bh s immediate progenitor to be a helium star of mass @xmath49 orbiting a ms companion of mass @xmath23 . in view of the strong tidal forces operating on the binary during the common - envelope phase of the primary , we furthermore consider the pre - sn orbit to be circular .",
    "the masses of the bh and its companion are assumed to remain constant until the onset of the rlo and x - ray phase .",
    "our goal in this analysis is to trace back the evolutionary history of known xrbs ( in this paper of the soft x - ray transient groj1655 - 40 ) and to constrain the properties of the system s progenitor just before and right after the sn explosion that formed the bh .",
    "the method adopted to derive the pre- and post - sn constraints incorporates the following set of calculations .",
    "we first use a stellar evolution code and calculate a grid of evolutionary sequences for binaries in which a bh is accreting mass from a roche - lobe filling companion . to consider the full range of possibilities , we include sequences for both conservative ( for sub - eddington rates ) and fully non - conservative mt . for each sequence",
    ", we examine whether at any point in time the calculated binary properties , i.e. , bh and donor masses , donor effective temperature and luminosity , and orbital period , are in agreement with the observational measurements or derivations of these quantities within their associated uncertainties . among these quantities ,",
    "the orbital period is measured with the highest accuracy and hence presents the most stringent constraint to be satisfied .",
    "we consider a large number of mt sequences and , although many of them can satisfy _ some _ of the constraints , the majority of sequences clearly fail to simultaneously satisfy _ all _ of the constraints at any given time . in the case of groj1655 - 40",
    "the successful sequences furthermore have to satisfy the additional requirement that the system exhibits transient behavior . for the time interval during which all other constraints are satisfied",
    ", the long - term mt rate from the donor star must therefore be lower than than the critical rate separating transient from persistent behavior ( dubus et al . 1999 ; see also king , kolb , & burderi 1996 ; king , kolb , & szuszkiewicz 1997 ) .",
    "this last requirement restricts the successful sequences even further . with the remaining fully successful sequences ,",
    "we derive the properties of the binary at the onset of the rlo phase : initial bh and donor masses , orbital period , and age of the donor star .",
    "the time at which the fully successful sequences satisfy all observational constraints furthermore provides an estimate for the donor s current age .",
    "next , we consider the kinematic evolutionary history of the xrb in the galactic potential . in particular , we use the current position and the measured 3d velocity with their associated uncertainties to trace the galactic motion back in time . combined with the tight constraints on the current age of the system given by the successful mt sequences this allows us to determine the position and velocity of the binary at the time of bh formation ( we denote these as the `` birth '' location and velocity ) . by subtracting the local galactic rotational velocity at this position from the system s total center - of - mass velocity , we then obtain an estimate for the _ peculiar _ velocity of the binary right after the formation of the bh .    the `` birth '' or post - sn peculiar velocity holds information about the mass loss and possibly the natal kick associated with the bh s formation .",
    "in order to extract this information we must however also constrain the orbital period and orbital eccentricity right after the formation of the bh .",
    "we derive these constraints in the third step of our analysis : we consider pairs of post - sn orbital periods and eccentricities and integrate the equations governing the evolution of the orbit under the influence of tides and general relativity ( possibly important for the most highly eccentric orbits ) forward in time . by using the age of the donor star at the onset of rlo for each of the successful mt sequences as an estimate for the time expired since the formation of the bh , we are able to map the post - sn orbital parameters to those at the onset of rlo .",
    "comparison with the binary properties at the onset of rlo given by the sequences then allows us to select only those pairs of post - sn orbital period and eccentricity that can match these properties at the right time ( i.e. at the right age or evolutionary stage of the donor star ) .    in the fourth step of our analysis",
    "we use the derived post - sn masses , orbital period , eccentricity , and peculiar velocity and examine the orbital dynamics of the compact object formation allowing for a natal kick . based on angular momentum and energy conservation",
    "we derive constraints on the pre - sn binary properties ( bh progenitor mass and orbital separation ) and the natal kick ( magnitude and direction ) that may have been imparted to the bh .",
    "in our final step , we use the initial bh masses from the successful mt sequences and the matching range of bh progenitor masses to study constraints on the core collapse mechanism . by modeling the collapse of bh progenitors and the resultant sn explosion",
    ", we can calculate the final range of sn explosion energies and nucleosynthetic yields for groj1655 - 40 . assuming the abundance enhancements in the bh companion are due to the sn explosion that formed the bh",
    ", we find strong evidence for the need for asymmetries in sn explosions associated with this bh formation event . in turn , with current stellar evolution and sn models , we can also further constrain the bh progenitor mass , and ultimately the pre - sn binary properties and the sn kick .",
    "these five steps are described in more detail in the following sections .",
    "we calculate a set of evolutionary sequences for mass - transferring binaries using an up - to - date stellar evolution code described in detail in podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , ivanova et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and kalogera et al .",
    "binary orbits are assumed to be circular and effects of stellar rotation are neglected at all times .",
    "mass - transfer rates are calculated self - consistently by imposing that the stellar radius remains close to the roche - lobe radius during the entire mt phase . in order to determine whether or not a system is transient",
    ", we use the criterion @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the mt rate , and @xmath52 the critical rate separating transient from persistent behavior ( dubus et al . 1999 ,",
    "kalogera et al .",
    "mass accretion onto the bh is furthermore limited to the eddington rate at all times and any excess mass leaving the system is assumed to carry away the specific orbital angular momentum of the accretor .",
    "mass - loss via stellar winds is taken into account using the rates given in hurley , pols , & tout ( 2000 ) . for the mixing - length and convective - overshooting parameters ,",
    "finally , we adopt values of 0.2 and 0.25 pressure scale heights , respectively .",
    "we furthermore note that all mt sequences considered have initial donor masses greater than @xmath53 so that no magnetic braking takes place in the donor star and the binary . for those sequences where mt causes the donor mass to decrease below this value by just one or two tenths of a solar mass ( relevant for bp s current donor mass estimates ) ,",
    "magnetic braking is still not included , given the relatively wide current orbit of the system .",
    "our goal with these calculations of mt sequences is to map out the 3-dimensional parameter space of bh and donor masses , and binary orbital period _ at the onset of rlo _ , for which _ all six _ observational constraints ( _ current _ masses , orbital period , donor luminosity and effective temperature , and transient behavior ) are satisfied _",
    "simultaneously_. since each mt calculation takes a significant amount of computational time ( from a few hours to a few days on one processor ) and often requires user intervention , it is currently not feasible to develop an automated and comprehensive scheme for the systematic and exhaustive search of the entire available 3-dimensional space .",
    "instead we therefore use a trial - and - error scheme guided strongly by the systematic behavior of the mt sequences in _ both _ the h - r diagram and the mass - period plane .",
    "we first examine the h - r tracks and adjust the rlo parameters so that tracks cross the h - r error box .",
    "next , we identify the time intervals for which the h - r constraints are satisfied and examine whether these parts of the tracks also cross the bh and donor mass errors bars _ and _ the orbital period measurement , the latter being the most stringent of all constraints .",
    "last we examine whether the sequence exhibits transient behavior for a significant fraction of the time interval over which the other constraints are satisfied .    in this way we are able to outline the extent of the parameter space that leads to `` successful '' mt sequences .",
    "it turns out that this extent is small enough so that the variations among the successful sequences do not significantly affect our final conclusions for constraints on the bh xrb progenitors ( see section  [ prog ] ) , as long as we stick to a given set of observational constraints ( gbo or bp ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is not necessary to strictly find _ all possible _ successful sequences , but instead to map the outline of their initial parameter space within about @xmath54m@xmath55 in the masses and about @xmath56d in the orbital period .    in order to capture the uncertainties related to the accretion of matter by the bh",
    ", we furthermore consider both conservative and non - conservative mt sequences for each of the two sets of observational constraints available for groj1655 - 40 .",
    "we note that in the conservative case , mass accretion onto the bh is still limited to the eddington rate and any mass transferred in excess of this rate is assumed to be lost from the system carrying the specific orbital angular momentum of the accretor .    before describing the sequences that are able to satisfy the observational constraints for groj1655 - 40",
    ", we briefly discuss the systematic behavior of the sequences and their dependency on the initial component masses and orbital period .",
    "the systematic behavior is illustrated in fig.[tracks ] for some selected evolutionary tracks which were chosen mainly to provide a clear and instructive picture .",
    "the displayed sequences therefore do _ not _ represent our best possible matches to the observed properties of groj1655 - 40 . for the latter , we refer to tables  [ gboseq ] and  [ bpseq ] where we list the main properties of some selected mt sequences and where the successful sequences are indicated in boldface .",
    "since we did not find any successful sequences with post - ms donor stars , we furthermore restricted fig",
    ".  [ tracks ] to systems with donors that are still on the ms .",
    "the initial component masses and orbital period of the sequences at the onset of mt are indicated in the top panel of the figure .",
    "sequences 15 illustrate the behavior for conservative mt , while sequence 6 illustrates the behavior for non - conservative mt . for convenience ,",
    "the parts of the sequences where the donor star satisfies the gbo or bp constraints in the h - r diagram are emphasized by thick solid lines .",

r diagram is similar for all considered sequences : the donor star follows its normal ms evolution until the onset of mt ( indicated by the filled circles ) and then evolves towards lower luminosities and lower effective temperatures as it adjusts to its decreasing mass .",
    "the evolutionary stage of the donor at the onset of mt is determined by the the orbital period at the start of the rlo phase . for a given bh and donor mass , longer initial periods",
    "yield more evolved donor stars and higher initial mt rates . since tracks with longer initial periods are also associated with larger donor stars , they furthermore tend to be shifted towards higher luminosities ( cf .",
    "sequences 2 and 3 ) .",
    "a similar tendency occurs when increasing the donor mass for a fixed bh mass and initial orbital period ( cf .",
    "sequences 1 , 3 , and 4 ) .",
    "the requirement that the sequences must pass through the observationally inferred position of groj1655 - 40 in the h - r diagram therefore gives a rough _ lower and upper limit on the initial period and donor mass _ at the onset of rlo .",
    "for a given donor mass and a given initial period , the bh mass and the amount of mass lost from the system during the mt process affect the evolution in the h - r diagram through the rate at which the donor reduces its mass .",
    "higher bh masses and non - conservative mt yield lower mt rates and therefore a slower decrease of the donor s luminosity and effective temperature during the mt phase compared to that for lower bh masses and conservative mt ( cf .",
    "sequences 4 , 5 , and 6 ) .",
    "these effects are less severe though than changes in the initial donor mass and orbital period .",
    "the variations of the mt rate expressed in units of the critical rate for transient behavior depend on the relative changes between these two quantities .",
    "after the onset of the mt phase , the decrease of the mass ratio and the increase of the orbital period cause the mt rate to decrease and the critical rate to increase , so that overall the ratio @xmath57 decreases with increasing orbital period .",
    "this tendency continues until the donor reaches the end of core - hydrogen burning and the associated expansion of the stellar radius causes the mt rate to increase more rapidly than the critical rate for transient behavior .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 therefore increases as well . during the subsequent evolution through the hertzsprung gap",
    ", no nuclear burning takes place and the mt rate stays roughly constant .",
    "since @xmath52 still increases slowly , the ratio @xmath57 slowly decreases .",
    "examination of fig.[tracks ] indicates how we can effectively identify _ winner _ sequences .",
    "all six sequences shown as an example satisfy the gbo or bp constraints in the h - r diagram , but only two of them ( sequence 2 and 3 ) satisfy the bp mass constraints , and only one of those satisfies the transient constraint ( sequence 3 ) .",
    "the mt sequences which are able to satisfy the constraints derived by gbo and bp are highlighted in boldface in tables  [ gboseq ] and  [ bpseq ] , respectively .    in the case of gbo constraints and conservative mt",
    ", successful sequences were found for initial bh masses ranging from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , initial donor masses ranging from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , and initial periods ranging from @xmath62 to @xmath63days .",
    "the lower limit on the initial bh mass arises from the requirement that , for conservative mt , lower mass bhs need a more massive donor star in order to accrete enough matter to reach the observed present - day bh mass . for orbital periods where rlo occurs when the donor is still close to the zams , the higher mt rates associated with more massive donor stars then cause the donor mass to decrease below the admissible range from 2.0 to2.8@xmath64 before the period reaches the present - day value of 2.62days . for longer orbital periods , on the other hand ,",
    "the donor star has a somewhat more developed helium core at the onset of rlo , which causes the star to be too luminous when the system reaches the observed period of 2.62days .",
    "the upper limit on the initial bh mass is determined by the requisite that as the initial bh mass gets closer to the present value of @xmath21 , the donor star must start rlo closer to its present state as well .",
    "this eventually requires mt to start in the hertzsprung gap which generally leads to mt rates that are too high for the system to be transient ( see , however , kolb et al .",
    "1997 and kolb 1998 for a discussion on soft x - ray transient in the hertzsprung gap ) . in the case of non - conservative mt",
    ", we kept the bh mass fixed to the mean value of @xmath65 . by keeping the bh mass constant",
    "we were able to to outline the initial donor masses at the onset of rlo with a somewhat higher resolution of 0.3 to @xmath66 without having to calculate an unrealistically large number of sequences .",
    "successful sequences were found for @xmath67@xmath61 and @xmath68@xmath69days .",
    "when the donor star crosses the allowed region in the h - r diagram , all successful mt sequences found for the gbo system parameters are furthermore only marginally consistent with the currently observed orbital period and donor mass .",
    "the mt rates at the period of 2.62days are always at least a factor of @xmath70 smaller than the critical mt rate for transient behavior .    in the case of bp constraints and conservative mt",
    ", successful sequences were found for @xmath71@xmath72 , @xmath73@xmath74 , and @xmath75@xmath76days , while for non - conservative mt successful sequences were found for @xmath77 , @xmath78@xmath61 , and @xmath75@xmath79days .",
    "the lower limit on the initial bh mass for conservative mt is again related to the higher donor masses required by initially less massive bhs to reach the present - day mass .",
    "the difference with the gbo sequences is , however , that the bh masses at the start of rlo are now so low that this requirement implies that mt initially starts on the thermal time scale of the donor star .",
    "this leads to highly super - eddington mt rates and significant mass loss from the system .",
    "consequently , initially even more massive donor stars are required for the bh to accrete enough to reach the observed present - day mass .",
    "these higher donor masses increase the mt rates even further , rendering the system persistent rather transient . the upper limit on",
    "the initial bh mass arises for the same reason as for the gbo sequences .",
    "the mt rates obtained when the donor star satisfies the observational constraints in the h - r diagram and when the binary reaches the observed period of 2.62days span a wide range of values : for some sequences the mt rates are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the critical rate for transient behavior , while for others the system is only marginally transient .",
    "in general , however , it turned out to be easier to find mt sequences satisfying the bp constraints than sequences satisfying the gbo constraints .",
    "an overview of the initial donor star masses and the initial orbital periods of the mt sequences listed in tables  [ gboseq][bpseq ] is given in fig .",
    "successful sequences are indicated by solid circles and unsuccessful ones by crosses .",
    "the figure clearly illustrates the extent of the parameter space covered by our calculations as well as the location of the successful sequences among the unsuccessful ones .",
    "the general trend in the initial parameters of the successful mt sequences is that lower initial donor masses require longer initial orbital periods in order to be successful .",
    "this is in agreement with the systematic behavior of the mt sequences illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tracks ] .",
    "we also note that mt sequences were calculated for bh masses outside the successful ranges quoted above , but for brevity these have been omitted from tables  [ gboseq][bpseq ] and fig .",
    "[ init ] .",
    "[ init ] and tables  [ gboseq][bpseq ] also show there is no single _ unique _ mt sequence that satisfies all the observational constraints . instead",
    ", a series of neighboring successful sequences is found for both gbo and bp constraints and for both conservative and non - conservative mt .",
    "in addition , the number of successful sequences found is limited only by our finite exploration of the available parameter space and the limitation of the calculations to the two extreme cases of fully conservative and fully non - conservative mt .",
    "adopting a higher resolution grid of initial component masses and orbital periods would increase the number of successful sequences even further as would the consideration of mt sequences for which the degree of mass conservation is in between the two extreme cases of fully conservative or non - conservative mt .",
    "fortunately , as we will see in section  [ prog ] , mt sequences with closely spaced initial parameters yield only small variations in the properties of the pre - sn binary progenitor and the kick that may have been imparted to the bh at birth .",
    "the vital point in the calculation of the presented mt sequences is therefore that we managed to outline the initial parameters of the successful sequences within a pre - determined accuracy rather than finding all possible mt sequences able to satisfy the present - day observational constraints for groj1655 - 40 .",
    "given the present position and velocity of groj1655 - 40 in the galaxy , we derive the post - sn peculiar velocity of the binary s mass center by tracing its orbit in the galaxy back to the birth time of the bh .",
    "a specific birth time is derived for _ each _ successful mt sequence by setting it equal to the _ current _ age of the donor star .",
    "the latter is a good estimate of the bh birth time within an uncertainty equal to the lifetime of the massive progenitor of the bh , which is typically less than 10myr .",
    "this uncertainty is always much smaller than the actual time expired since the birth of the bh .",
    "we describe the motion of the system with respect to a right - handed cartesian frame of reference @xmath80 whose origin coincides with the galactic center and whose @xmath81-plane coincides with the mid - plane of the galactic disk . the direction from the projection of the sun s position onto the galactic plane to the galactic center",
    "is taken as the positive direction of the @xmath82-axis , the direction from the sun to the northern galactic pole as the positive direction of the @xmath83-axis , and the direction of the galactic rotational velocity at the position of the sun as the positive direction of the @xmath84-axis . in terms of these coordinates ,",
    "the sun is located at @xmath85 with @xmath86kpc , @xmath87 , and @xmath88pc ( reid 1993 ; humphreys & larsen 1995 , and references therein ) .",

    "the equations governing the system s motion in the galaxy are integrated backward in time up to the time corresponding to the current age of the donor star , as given by the evolutionary sequence .    in fig .",

    "et al . ( 2002 ) , the system always remains within 3 to 7kpc from the galactic center and within 200pc from the galactic plane .",
    "the post - sn peculiar velocity @xmath100 of the binary is obtained by subtracting the local galactic rotational velocity from the total systemic velocity at the birth site of the bh .",
    "the variations of @xmath100 as a function of the time expired since the formation of the bh are displayed in fig .",
    "the hatched vertical bars indicate the bh birth times determined by the age of the donor star for each of the successful mt sequences listed in tables  [ gboseq][bpseq ] .",
    "the width of the bars corresponds to an uncertainty in the birth times of 10myr . when accounting for the uncertainties in the distance and the velocity components ( cf .",
    "[ orbit ] ) , the post - sn peculiar velocity can span a wide range of values ranging from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "this wide range is a result of our determination of the possible uncertainties in the galactic orbit which likely overestimates the true error bars on @xmath103 .",
    "nevertheless , in order to be conservative , we consider the full range of possible post - sn peculiar velocities given by the grey shaded area in fig .",
    "after the formation of the bh , the orbital parameters of the binary are subjected to secular changes due to the perturbation of the external gravitational field from spherical symmetry by the ms star s tidal distortion and due to the loss of orbital angular momentum via gravitational radiation . since the tidal interactions depend on both the orbital and rotational properties of the ms star , the star s rotational angular velocity right after the sn explosion that formed the bh enters the problem as an additional unknown quantity .",
    "we here assume that the the rotational angular velocity of the ms star is unaffected by the sn explosion and that just before the explosion the star s rotation rate was synchronized with the orbital motion .",

    "[ orbev ] for the example case of a binary consisting of a @xmath72 bh and a @xmath135 zero - age ms star , and for four different combinations of initial orbital separations and eccentricities .",
    "the four combinations are chosen such that after approximately @xmath136myr of orbital evolution the total angular momentum of the binary is approximately equal to the total angular momentum of the binary represented by mt sequence bp[example1 ] ( see table  [ bpseq ] ) at the onset of the mt phase .",
    "the choice to match the orbital angular momentum at the end of the orbital evolution calculations to the orbital angular momentum of the mt sequence at the onset of rlo is equivalent to assuming that tides circularize the binary instantaneously at @xmath137myr . ] .",

    "[ orbev ] show the relative rates of secular change of the semi - major axis @xmath108 and the orbital eccentricity @xmath109 ( for tides and gr separately ) as functions of the time expired since the formation of the bh .",
    "for all four combinations of initial orbital separations and eccentricities , the gr rates remain almost constant throughout the considered time interval , while the rates due to tides increase significantly as the star evolves on the ms .",
    "this behavior reflects the independence of gravitational radiation on the size and structure of the star and the strong dependence of tides on the ratio of the stellar radius to the orbital semi - major axis .",
    "the plots also illustrate that , for binaries consisting of a compact object and a young early - type secondary , gravitational radiation and tides , at some points in time , may affect the orbital evolution to comparable degrees .",
    "the actual evolution of the semi - major axis @xmath108 , the orbital eccentricity @xmath109 , and the periastron distance @xmath138 due to the combined effect of tides and gravitational radiation is displayed in the lower - left panels of fig.[orbev ] . as expected from the low rates of secular change displayed in the upper two panels ,",
    "the orbital parameters remain almost constant during the first 300 - 400myr of evolution and start changing noticeably when the star gets closer to the end of the ms and tidal effects become dominant .    finally , in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ orbev ] we compare the evolution of the stellar radius with the evolution of the roche - lobe radius at the periastron of the ms star s relative orbit for each of the four considered combinations of initial orbital separations and eccentricities .",
    "the roche - lobe radii at periastron are determined by @xmath139 where @xmath140 ( eggleton 1983 ) .",
    "it follows that although all four pairs of initial orbital separations and eccentricities lead to orbital configurations that are consistent with the successful mt sequence bp[example1 ] at the onset of rlo , only one pair ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 ) leads to rlo at periastron at a time that is sufficiently close to the age of the donor star required to make the sequence successful in the first place .",
    "the other three pairs all yield rlo at periastron at times that are @xmath143myr too early .",
    "they would therefore only yield viable progenitors for groj1655 - 40 if rlo at periastron is assumed to conserve the binary s total angular momentum and if the total amount of mass transferred from the donor star is small enough to not significantly change its properties so that it would follow a different evolutionary path in the h - r diagram .",
    "if either of these conditions is violated , the considered pair of initial orbital separation and eccentricity is incompatible with the starting point of the successful rlo sequence under consideration .",
    "at the time of the sn explosion , the mass lost from the system and possibly the kick imparted to the bh during the explosion change the binary s orbital parameters .",
    "the pre- and post - sn component masses , orbital semi - major axis , and orbital eccentricity are related by the conservation laws of orbital energy and angular momentum , which in turn depend on the magnitude and the direction of the kick velocity that may be imparted to the bh .",
    "we describe these relations and the associated progenitor and kick velocity constraints in more detail in sections  [ symmsn ] and  [ asymmsn ] . in these sections ,",
    "we adopt the same notations for the orbital elements as before , but add the subscripts `` presn '' and `` postsn '' to distinguish between their values before and after the sn explosion that formed the bh .",
    "we first note though that there are two additional constraints that need to be imposed on the bh progenitor besides those arising from the orbital dynamics of symmetric and asymmetric sn explosions .",
    "one is that , for each successful mt sequence , the progenitor mass must of course be more massive than the initial bh mass at the onset of rlo .",
    "the other is that the bh progenitor must fit within its pre - sn roche lobe . strictly speaking",
    "this is not a necessary condition ( dewi & van den heuvel 2004 ; willems & kalogera 2004 ; and willems et al .",
    "2004 , for example , showed that the progenitor of psr  j0737 - 3039b was filling its roche lobe at the time of its collapse ) .",
    "nevertheless , we impose this condition to avoid complications arising from accretion - induced changes in the stellar structure of the ms companion that will become the xrb donor star during the x - ray phase .",
    "we have tested this assumption by omitting the second constraint from our calculations and found no appreciable change in the derived progenitor and kick velocity constraints .",
    "the orbital dynamics of symmetric sn explosions have been discussed extensively in the past ( e.g. , blaauw 1961 ; boersma 1961 ; hills 1983 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ) .",
    "we recall that the changes in the pre - sn orbital parameters are entirely determined by the amount of mass lost from the system during the explosion , yielding a post - sn semi - major axis and orbital eccentricity given by @xmath144 @xmath145 where @xmath49 is the mass of the bh s helium star progenitor .",

    "additional highly eccentric post - sn orbits with large semi - major axes become available .",
    "correspondingly , the constraints on the pre - sn orbital separation also extend to very large values .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for the constraints on @xmath49 and @xmath150 . when rlo at periastron occurs within @xmath187myr of the required donor age , @xmath188 and @xmath189 . for our preferred set of solutions",

    "since highly eccentric post - sn orbital configurations always fall under the latter category , we do not consider post - sn orbital eccentricities larger than 0.9 in the derivation of any of the constraints .    to understand the core - collapse event leading to the formation of the bh , we are mainly interested in the constraints derived for the mass of the bh s helium star progenitor and the kick velocity that may have been imparted to the bh at birth .",
    "for the remainder of this section , we therefore restrict ourselves to presenting the constraints derived for these two quantities .",
    "given that there is no way to distinguish which of the various successful mt sequences corresponds to the true progenitor of groj1655 - 40 , we derive the constraints for each successful sequence and examine them collectively .",

    "although a robust mechanism may actually exist where 10% effects are not important , it is important to understand that the actual progenitors of core - collapse ( massive stars with masses above 89@xmath211 ) are not too dissimilar , yet nature produces a range of remnant masses .",
    "it appears that nature too is sensitive to small changes in the details .    a massive star collapses until it reaches nuclear densities .",
    "a proto - ns is formed and the explosion occurs if the neutrinos from the cooling ns can provide enough energy to drive off the rest of the star .",
    "as the explosion is launched , matter expands off the ns surface , and the cells are split to retain resolution with our lagrangian code near the ns surface .",
    "after @xmath2101s the explosion shock is well - developed ( @xmath218 km ) . at this point ,",
    "the ns is cut out of the simulation and modelled as a gravitational source with a hard boundary .",
    "the explosion is then followed until the shock reaches the edge of the surface of the helium star .",
    "at this point , the energy in the exploding star is primarily in kinetic energy and we can determine the rough sn explosion energy of these objects ( see table  [ ccmod ] ) .",
    "we also determine the bh mass by assuming all material with velocities less than the escape velocity will ultimately fall back onto the ns ( see table  [ ccmod ] ) .",
    "for all cases , we can produce a bh with a mass lying somewhere between @xmath219@xmath220 , but the resulting energies for these bhs lies between @xmath221erg .",
    "our understanding of core - collapse theory can also be used to constrain the bh progenitors .",
    "fryer ( 1999 ) found that , using a multi - dimensional core - collapse code , massive stars above @xmath21020@xmath211 achieved explosion energy ( when the shock was near 1000 - 3000 km ) of roughly @xmath222erg .",
    "there are a number of uncertainties in these `` first - principle '' collapse calculations and this answer can change considerably with more accurate codes .",
    "but if we take these simulations at face value and assume that the energy is , within a factor of 2 , accurate , we can also rule out some progenitors . from table",
    "[ ccmod ] , we see that only progenitors below 10@xmath211 can obtain the appropriate bh mass with less than about @xmath223erg of explosion energy when the shock is launched .",
    "this constraint ( the second from stellar and core - collapse models ) is strongest for small bh masses .",
    "we can also use the nucleosynthetic yields to constrain the models . as noted above",
    ", the 14 isotope nuclear network used in the hydrodynamics simulations is used only to determine energetics . to obtain more detailed abundance information , we post - processed the thermodynamic trajectories of our lagrangian particles with a modern 500 isotope network ( e.g. , timmes 1999 ) . for simplicity",
    "we assumed an initial electron fraction of 0.5 .",
    "the iron , titanium , sulfur and oxygen yields as a function of enclosed mass for three representative models are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : abun ] .",
    "these three models : @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , each produce bhs with masses above 4@xmath211 .",
    "oxygen and even some sulfur is formed well out in the star , but titanium and iron are formed in the most intense burning at the base of the explosion .",
    "however , note that the more massive stars produce iron and titanium further out than the low - mass stars .",
    "this occurs because the more massive stars require stronger explosions to produce bhs of comparable mass to the lower mass stars .",
    "the stronger explosions produce intensive nuclear burning further out in the star , ultimately producing iron further out in the star as well .",
    "do such abundance profiles provide additional , useful information ? we often use the nucleosynthetic signature from supernovae to constrain sn progenitors .",
    "however , the yields from these stars must mix out extensively in the explosion just to get ejected .",
    "these bh forming stars will not dominate the nuclear yields of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , due to their weak explosions , the nucleosynthetic yields from these explosions are not likely to mix extensively into the interstellar medium . the timescale ( @xmath230 ) for the sn shock to once again become part of the interstellar medium ( when the shock velocity drops below the sound speed of the ambient medium )",
    "is roughly ( mckee & hollenbach 1980 ) : @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath233erg ; and @xmath234 in units of @xmath235cms@xmath1 and @xmath236 are , respectively , the sound speed and particle density of the ambient medium .",
    "the corresponding maximum extent ( @xmath237 ) of the sn shock is : @xmath238 the timescales and effective volumes ( as a fraction of a normal @xmath233 erg explosion ) of the remnants of these bhs are given in table  [ ccmod ] .",
    "with such short - lived , small remnants , it is unlikely that we will be able to constrain these stars by galactic or remnant abundances .",
    "however , israelian et al . ( 1999 ) observed the companion of gro j1655 - 40 during a quiescent x - ray phase using the high - resolution spectrograph at keck .",
    "at visible wavelengths , they found that the abundances of o , mg , s , si , and ti were 6 - 10 times larger than solar .",
    "they also found that [ fe / h ] = 0.1 @xmath239 0.2 , i.e. almost solar",
    ". the most straightforward and logical way of explaining these overabundances , and the one proposed by israelian et al .",
    ", is that these elements were produced during explosive oxygen and silicon burning during the bh formation and have enriched the companion .",
    "but to cause this enrichment , these elements must make it to the companion star .",
    "for the iron and titanium , this can be quite a difficult task . at the time of explosion",
    "the companion was roughly @xmath240 from the center of the collapsing star .",
    "but our 1-dimensional explosion models find that the iron and titanium does not make it beyond 0.05@xmath241 before falling back onto the compact remnant .",
    "even in 3-dimensional simulations , the amount of mixing found in symmetric models does not place the iron or titanium beyond 0.5@xmath241 before these elements fall back onto the compact remnant .",
    "the extensive mixing required to eject these elements requires large asymmetries in the explosion ( hungerford et al .",
    "2003 ; hungerford et al .",
    "2004 ) . hence ,",
    "if the enrichment of the companion of gro j1655 - 40 is arising from the explosion forming the bh , its sn must have been asymmetric !",
    "the amount of asymmetry reaches a minimum with the lower mass progenitors ( especially with massive bhs ) . for example , in the extreme case of a bh mass of 6.2@xmath211 , the 6.2@xmath211 progenitor will not , no matter what the asymmetry , be able to enrich the companion .",
    "even with smaller bh masses , it is likely that the helium progenitor for this system is more massive ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "this is our third , and final , constraint on the helium star mass .    in principal , the exact abundances of the companion star",
    "could be used to determine the best - fitting bh progenitor ( see podsiadlowski et al .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the level of asymmetry and the uncertainties of the effects of asymmetry on the actual nuclear yield make it difficult to produce any accurate quantitative results .",
    "these uncertainties must then be folded into uncertainties in the accretion onto the companion .",
    "the study of asymmetry - induced mixing is still in its infancy . when it is better understood , the actual composition of the companion star can be used to constrain the progenitors as well .",
    "although there exist a number of uncertainties in stellar evolution and core - collapse calculations , these models can place additional constraints on the bh progenitor for groj1655 - 40 :    * * i : @xmath243 - stellar winds . * with current mass - loss rates for winds ,",
    "helium cores above this mass are simply not produced .",
    "the limitation of this constraint lies in the uncertainties in stellar winds .",
    "given that bh masses for some other systems have been estimated to be as high as @xmath244 ( mcclintock & remillard 2004 , and references therein ) , we do not consider this constraint to be very stringent . *",
    "* ii : @xmath245 - supernova energetics . *",
    "if explosion energies for these massive stars do decrease with increasing stellar mass , it is impossible to get low - mass bhs with more massive helium stars .",
    "this constraint is strongest for the low - end of the bh mass range allowed for gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "this constraint is limited by uncertainties in the core - collapse mechanism . *",
    "* iii : @xmath246 - nucleosynthetic yields .",
    "* if the high abundances of the companion to gro j1655 - 40 are due to ejecta enrichment , large asymmetries are required to mix out the iron and titanium so that it is ejected .",
    "prohibitively large asymmetries are required for low - mass progenitors .",
    "this constraint is strongest for bh masses at the high - end of the allowed range for gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "the dominant limitation in this constraint arises from the uncertainty of the true enrichment in the companion of gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "in addition to constraints on the progenitor mass , our calculations also show how observations of gro j1655 - 40 can constrain sn explosions .",
    "if the anomalous abundances in the companion to gro j1655 - 40 truly arise from enrichment from the bh - forming sn , then this object provides some of the best evidence not only for the occurrence of a sn explosion , but also for asymmetries in the explosions ( israelian et al .",
    "1999 , podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2002b ) . a better constraint on the progenitor ( as well as a better understanding of structure of the asymmetries ) could significantly constrain the magnitude of the asymmetry in this explosion .",
    "in this paper , we initiated a comprehensive study on the formation and evolution of galactic xrbs .",
    "based on the current binary properties and the current position and motion of observed xrbs , the kinematic and evolutionary history is traced back in time and constraints are derived for the pre - sn binary progenitor and for the kick velocity that may have been imparted to the compact object at birth .",
    "the analysis consists of the following elements : ( i ) mt calculations to model the ongoing x - ray phase , ( ii ) orbital evolution due to tides and gravitational radiation between the compact object formation time and the onset of rlo , ( iii ) motion of the system in the galaxy after the formation of the compact object , ( iv ) binary orbital dynamics at the time of core collapse , and ( v ) hydrodynamic modeling of the actual core collapse event .    as a first application",
    ", we constrained the progenitor properties and the formation of the bh in the soft x - ray transient groj1655 - 40 .",
    "for this purpose , we calculated a large number of mt sequences to map the currently observed binary properties ( component masses , position of the donor in the h - r diagram , orbital period , and transient behavior ) to those at the onset of the mt phase .",
    "uncertainties related to the accretion of matter by the bh are incorporated by considering both conservative ( for sub - eddington rates ) and non - conservative mt . for the current system configuration , we considered both the parameters derived by gbo and those derived by bp ( see table  [ 1655param ] for details ) . in the case of gbo parameters ,",
    "successful mt sequences able to reproduce all currently observed system properties were found for initial bh masses @xmath247@xmath65 , initial donor star masses @xmath248@xmath61 , and initial orbital periods @xmath68@xmath63days . in the case of bp parameters , successful sequences were found for initial bh masses @xmath71@xmath249 , initial donor star masses @xmath250@xmath74 , and initial orbital periods @xmath251@xmath76days . for both cases , all successful sequences have a ms donor star at the onset of rlo . a graphical representation of the initial donor masses and orbital periods leading to successful mt sequences is presented in fig .  [ init ] .",
    "properties of the sequences are given in tables  [ gboseq][bpseq ] .",
    "the results of the mt calculations are in good agreement with previous investigations .",
    "regs , tout , & wickramasinghe ( 1998 ) showed that the present - day properties of groj1655 - 40 ( as determined by orosz & bailyn 1997 ) could be reproduced by a binary initially consisting of a @xmath252 ms star orbiting a @xmath253 bh with a period of 1.935days .",
    "these initial parameters are fairly close to those of the successful mt sequence gbo[rtw ] in table  [ gboseq ] , except for the higher initial bh mass adopted by regs et al .",
    "this small difference can be attributed to the higher current bh mass of @xmath254 estimated by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) as well as to some different input physics in the stellar evolution codes , such as , e.g. , the amount of convective overshooting .",
    "kolb et al . ( 1997 ) and kolb ( 1998 ) , on the other hand , suggested that groj1655 - 40 may be in a very short - lived evolutionary phase in the hertzsprung gap during which the expansion of the donor s radius temporarily halts or even reverses . as a consequence , the mt rate drops below the high rates typically expected for hertzsprung - gap donor stars , allowing for a short phase of transient behavior . in view of the small size of the relevant region in the hertzsprung gap ( see , e.g. , fig . 2 in kolb et al .",
    "1997 ) and the associated short evolutionary time scales , progenitors which start rlo while the donor is still on the ms seem statistically more favorable .",
    "we therefore did not attempt to reproduce the small transient strip in the hertzsprung gap found by kolb et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and kolb ( 1998 ) . in their investigation , kolb et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also adopted the bh mass derived by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) , which is lower than that derived by both gbo ( @xmath41 ) and bp ( @xmath255 ) .",
    "since , for a given donor mass and orbital period , the mt rate tends to increase with decreasing bh mass , the small transient strip in the hertzsprung gap may disappear when the more recent bh mass estimates are adopted .",
    "bp , finally , found that , using their estimates for the system parameters , both case  a and early case  b mt sequences are able to reproduce the observed system properties , but that case  a sequences generally provided more satisfactory fits .",
    "their example sequence with initial parameters @xmath256 , @xmath175 , and @xmath257days is close to our sequence bp[bpeg ] ( see table  [ bpseq ] ) , although the latter has a somewhat higher initial donor mass , possibly due to differences in the adopted convective overshooting .",
    "a crucial element emerging from the mt calculations is the age of the donor star when all observational constraints are satisfied ( i.e.  the donor s _ current _ age ) . by using this age as an estimate for the time expired since the bh formation",
    ", we determined the possible birth sites of the bh by following the motion of the system in the galaxy backwards in time .",
    "it follows that groj1655 - 40 was born between 3 and 7kpc from the galactic center , and within 200pc from the galactic plane",
    ". the post - sn peculiar velocity at the birth site can be anywhere between @xmath101 and @xmath258 .",
    "we use this post - sn peculiar velocity to constrain the amount of mass lost in the sn explosion and the kick velocity that may have been imparted to the bh .",
    "this is a major difference with previous investigations on the kinematics of groj1655 - 40 which used the _ present - day _ radial velocity ( after correcting for the motion of the sun and differential galactic rotation , @xmath259 ; brandt et al .",
    "1995 ) as a lower limit to the binary s center - of - mass velocity ( see brandt et al .",
    "1995 , nelemans et al . 1999 ,",
    "fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "the mt sequences also yield the age of the donor at the onset of rlo .",
    "knowledge of this age allows us to link the post - sn orbital parameters to those at the onset of rlo by numerically integrating the system of differential equations governing the orbital evolution due to tides and gravitational radiation .",
    "post - sn orbital semi - major axes and eccentricities compatible with successful mt sequences range from @xmath260 to @xmath261 and from @xmath262 to @xmath263 .",
    "the solution of the equations describing the conservation of orbital energy and angular momentum during compact object formation allows us to derive constraints on the pre - sn orbital separation , on the mass of the bh s helium star progenitor , and on the magnitude of the kick velocity that may have been imparted to the bh at birth . despite the large number of successful mt sequences found , the progenitor constraints turn out to be fairly robust to the initial parameters of the sequences at the onset of rlo ( see fig .  [ overview ] ) .",
    "combining the constraints obtained for all successful mt sequences for both conservative and non - conservative mt , yields @xmath264@xmath265 and @xmath266@xmath267 for gbo system parameters and @xmath268@xmath269 and @xmath270@xmath271 for bp system parameters ( see fig .  [ overview2 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that symmetric sn explosions lie at the edge of our solution ranges and that bh kicks of at least a few tens of kms@xmath1 are favored by the majority of the successful mt sequences ( see tables  [ gboseq][bpseq ] ) .",
    "hence , although some of the constraints associated with individual mt sequences require a kick to be imparted to the bh at birth ( see figs .",
    "[ eg][overview3 ] and tables  [ gboseq][bpseq ] ) , without any additional information , the still remaining uncertainties in the present - day system parameters at this stage do not allow us to exclude that the bh in groj1655 - 40 may have been formed through a symmetric sn explosion . in the final step of our investigation , we therefore model the core collapse using a 1d lagrangian hydrodynamics code . from the energetics of the sn explosion , it follows that the mass of the bh s helium star progenitor must be larger than @xmath272 .",
    "in addition , if the observed overabundances of heavy elements in the bh s companion are to be attributed to pollution from sn ejecta , the nucleosynthesis yields imply a maximum helium - star mass of @xmath273 .",
    "combining this with the constraints derived from the mt sequences , orbital dynamics , and motion in the galaxy gives @xmath274 in the case of gbo parameters and @xmath275 in the case of bp parameters .",
    "our final set of constraints on the progenitor are much different than those obtained by podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2002b ) who predict the likely progenitor to lie between @xmath276 .",
    "but these differences are not due to different estimates of a given constraint , but the application of different constraints .",
    "podsiadlowski et al . (",
    "2002b ) focus their attention on the enrichment of the companion . as with our enrichment constraint ( constraint iii from  9 ) , they find that more massive stars are better suited to explain the nucleosynthetic enrichment in the companion .",
    "our constraint is slightly weaker , based on the simulations of hungerford et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) which suggest that asymmetries can lead to very extended mixing .",
    "we have an additional limit based on both our mass - loss and supernova explosion model constraints ( i and ii from  9 ) that push for lower - mass progenitors . since podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2002b ) do nt consider these constraints , they do not have this upper limit in their paper .",
    "the question of whether or not a natal kick was imparted to the bh in groj1655 - 40 was addressed previously by brandt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , nelemans et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and fryer & kalogera ( 2001 ) .",
    "all three of these investigations used a lower limit on the present - day center - of - mass velocity given by the _",
    "current _ radial velocity ( @xmath277 ) instead of the actual post - sn peculiar velocity to constrain the mass loss and kick magnitude associated with the bh s formation . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vcm ] , this neglects changes in the system s center - of - mass velocity resulting from its acceleration in the galactic potential .",
    "we here find that , even though following the galactic motion of the system backward in time yields post - sn peculiar velocities all the way down to @xmath278 , the additional constraints on the binary properties make the possibility of a symmetric sn explosion only marginally acceptable solutions .",
    "jonker & nelemans ( 2004 ) recently reconsidered the vertical distribution of low - mass xrbs with respect to the galactic plane and found no significant difference between ns and bh systems , suggesting that bhs may be subjected to natal kicks as well .",
    "the authors furthermore noted that the distances to galactic soft x - ray transients may be systematically underestimated .",
    "if this is truly so , revised distance estimates may have important consequences for the determination of quiescent x - ray luminosities , peak outburst luminosities , bh masses , and galactic distribution of bh xrbs .",
    "clearly , if future measurements significantly revise any of the observational constraints , the analysis presented in this paper should be repeated to account for the most up - to - date knowledge of groj1655 - 40 s current system properties .    in subsequent analyses ,",
    "we intend to apply the procedure outlined above to the soft x - ray transient xte1118 + 480 , the high - mass xrbs cyg x-1 , ls5039 , lsi@xmath279 , velax-1 , 4u1700 - 37 , and the ns low - mass xrb scox-1 . by examining both ns and bh systems and",
    "both rlo and stellar wind induced mt , we hope to unravel the systematic dependencies between the masses of newly formed compact objects and their immediate pre - sn progenitors , the mass lost at core collapse , and the possible kick velocity magnitude imparted to the compact object at birth .",
    "we expect that such constraints will help us understand better the physical origin of asymmetries in the collapse of massive stars .",

    "<S> in recent years proper motion measurements have been added to the set of observational constraints on the current properties of galactic x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an analysis that allows us to consider all this available information and reconstruct the full evolutionary history of x - ray binaries back to the time of core collapse and compact object formation . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis accounts for five evolutionary phases : mass transfer through the ongoing x - ray phase , tidal circularization before the onset of roche - lobe overflow , motion through the galactic potential after the formation of the compact object , binary orbital dynamics at the time of core collapse , and hydrodynamic modeling of the core collapse that connects the compact object to its progenitor and any nucleosynthetic constraints available . in this first paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present this analysis in a comprehensive manner and we apply it to the soft x - ray transient groj165540 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first analysis that incorporates all observational constraints on the current system properties and uses the full 3d peculiar velocity constraints right after core collapse instead of lower limits on the current space velocity given by the present - day radial velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the system has remained within 200pc from the galactic plane throughout its entire life time and that the mass loss and a kick possibly associated with the black hole formation imparted a kick velocity of @xmath0115kms@xmath1 to the binary s center of mass . </S>",
    "<S> right after black hole formation , the system consists of a @xmath2 black hole and a @xmath3 main - sequence star . at the onset of the x - ray phase </S>",
    "<S> the donor is still on the main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a symmetric black hole formation event can not be formally excluded , but that the associated system parameters are only marginally consistent with the currently observed binary properties . </S>",
    "<S> black hole formation mechanisms involving an asymmetric supernova explosion with associated black hole kick velocities of a few tens of kms@xmath1 , on the other hand , satisfy the constraints much more comfortably . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive an upper limit on the black hole kick magnitude of @xmath4 . </S>"
