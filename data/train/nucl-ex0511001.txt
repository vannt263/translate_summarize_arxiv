    "the merits and physics potentials for crystal scintillators in low - energy low - background experiments were recently discussed  @xcite . this detector technology has been adopted in double beta decay , dark matter and reactor neutrino experiments , and considered for low energy solar neutrino detection .",
    "an important common issue is the contamination of radioactive isotopes in the crystals .",
    "this article reports measurements of the intrinsic radiopurity in csi(tl ) crystals .",
    "the measurements were performed at the kuo - sheng ( ks ) nuclear power plant where a laboratory located at a distance of 28  m from the reactor core has been built to study low energy neutrino physics  @xcite .",
    "a multi - purpose `` inner target '' detector space of 100  @xmath2680  @xmath2675  cm is enclosed by 4@xmath27 passive shielding materials which have a total weight of 50 tons .",
    "the shielding provides attenuation to the ambient neutron and gamma background , and consists of , from inside out , 5  cm of ofhc copper , 25  cm of boron - loaded polyethylene , 5  cm of steel , 15  cm of lead , and cosmic - ray veto scintillator panels .",
    "different detectors can be placed in the inner space for different scientific goals .",
    "the detectors are read out by a versatile electronics and data acquisition ( daq ) system@xcite based on 16-channel , 20  mhz , 8-bit flash analog - to - digital - convertor  ( fadc ) modules .",
    "the readout allows full recording of all the relevant pulse shape and timing information for as long as 500  @xmath28s after the initial trigger with a resolution of 1  @xmath28s .",
    "the data are then read out and transferred to the host computer , and the average daq dead time is 5.13  ms per event . the timing information for every event was recorded with a resolution of @xmath291  ms .",
    "the time differences between subsequent events and between different triggers within an event can be evaluated .",
    "software procedures have been devised to extend the effective dynamic range from the nominal 8-bit measurement range provided by the fadc@xcite .",
    "one of the detectors placed inside the inner target volume is an array of csi(tl ) crystal scintillators@xcite , the schematic of which is displayed in figure  [ csiarray ] .",
    "each crystal module is 2  kg in mass and consists of a hexagonal - shaped cross - section with 2  cm side and a length of 40  cm .",
    "the light output are read out at both ends ( @xmath30 ) by custom - designed 29  mm diameter photo - multiplier tubes(pmts ) with low - activity glass .",
    "the sum and difference of the pmt signals give information on the energy and the longitudinal z - position of the events , respectively .",
    "performance of the prototype modules was published in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a total of 186  kg ( or 93  modules )",
    "was commissioned for the 2003 data taking .",
    "the physics goal is to measure the standard model neutrino - electron scattering cross sections , and thereby to provide a measurement of @xmath31 at the untested mev range .",
    "the strategy  @xcite is to focus on data at high ( @xmath322  mev ) recoil energy where the uncertainties due to the reactor neutrino spectra are small .",
    "the large target mass compensates the drop in the cross - sections at high energy .",
    "this article focuses on the measurements of the intrinsic @xmath0 level as well as those for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 series in the csi(tl ) crystals using the correlated events from @xmath33-@xmath34 and @xmath34-@xmath34 decay sequences .",
    "our work complements and extends the scope of those previous efforts on this  @xcite and other crystal scintillators : nai(tl )  @xcite , cdwo@xmath35  @xcite , gso(ce )  @xcite , cef@xmath36  @xcite , baf@xmath37  @xcite and caf@xmath37(eu )  @xcite .",
    "the achieved sensitivities match the best among these results as well as those from massive liquid scintillator facility  @xcite .",
    "several detector parameters can be derived from these measurements , providing a means of _ in situ _ monitoring of the detector calibration and performance .",
    "in addition , another csi(tl ) detector array of mass 200  kg is being prepared in the yang - yang underground laboratory in south korea to look for cold dark matter  @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the intrinsic radioactivity in csi(tl ) is essential to both experiments .",
    "the methods devised are applicable to a wide spectrum of low - background experiments where @xmath34/@xmath38 discrimination is possible and the detailed timing information are available .",
    "the isotope @xmath0 is produced artificially as fission waste from power reactors and atomic weapon tests .",
    "cesium compounds are highly soluble and hence @xmath0 can easily be introduced into cesium products during the processing from cesium ore ( like pollucite ) .",
    "once introduced , there is no chemical means to separate @xmath0 from the stable @xmath39cs .",
    "this is the dominant one background contribution to dark matter experiments using csi(tl ) crystals as target  @xcite .",
    "the isotope decays via  @xcite : @xmath40 with the emission of a @xmath38-ray of energy 662  kev .",
    "a total of 31.3  kg - day of csi(tl ) data was analyzed .",
    "the spectrum is displayed in figure  [ cs137]a , showing a distinct line at this energy with a root - mean - square ( rms ) resolution of 5.1% .",
    "other naturally - occuring @xmath38-lines , like those from @xmath41k and @xmath42tl , can also be observed .",
    "the z - position distribution of the @xmath9cs events are shown in figure  [ cs137]b .",
    "events within @xmath43 of the @xmath38-peak give excess on both ends of the 40-cm long crystals due to external background .",
    "the uniform distribution after a @xmath44 cut indicates the source of @xmath0 is internal to the crystals .",
    "simulation studies give an efficiency of 42% for full capture of the 662  kev @xmath38-ray in a single crystal .",
    "accordingly , an average activity of 61@xmath452  mbq kg@xmath46 , or equivalently a contamination level of @xmath47  g / g , can be derived for the csi(tl ) crystals .",
    "the rms spread of the activity among the 31  crystals studied is 30% .",
    "alternatively , the radiopurity of the csi powder with which the csi(tl ) crystals were produced have been measured with a high - purity germanium detector .",
    "the measured @xmath0 abundance is @xmath48  g / g , consistent with the in situ results .",
    "it has been well - studied  @xcite that the light emission profiles of scintillating csi(tl ) crystals exhibit different shape for @xmath38-rays and electrons ( that is , minimum ionizing particles ) , as compared to that for @xmath34-particles and nuclear recoils at the @xmath32100  kev regime  .",
    "heavily ionizing events due to @xmath34-particles and nuclear recoils have _ faster _ decays than those from e/@xmath38 s @xmath49 opposite to the response in liquid scintillator  @xcite .",
    "the _ average _ pulse shapes for both categories are depicted in figures  [ psdshape ] , where t=0 is defined by the trigger instant .",
    "this characteristic property makes particle identification possible with this scintillator  @xcite .    matured pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) techniques have been devised at high energies where the photo - electrons are abundant . the `` double charge method ''",
    "@xcite involves the comparison of the `` total charge '' ( @xmath50 ) and the `` partial charge '' ( @xmath51 ) , which are the total and partial integration of the pulse , respectively . in this analysis , @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "were evaluated by integrating the entire pulse from @xmath490.75 to 12.8  @xmath28s , and the tail from 5 to 12.8  @xmath28s , respectively , with respect to the timing shown in figure  [ psdshape ] .    with the digitized pulse information measured by the fadcs , the mean time method is often used .",
    "the mean time is defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the fadc - amplitude at time - bin @xmath54 .",
    "the psd capabilities to make @xmath34/@xmath38 identification for mev events are displayed in figure  [ psd]a&b for both methods , indicating excellent separation .",
    "these features can be extended to the low energy regime where photo - electron statistics are limited , via advanced software techniques  @xcite .",
    "this is relevant to the dark matter experiments .",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay series are naturally occurring , and exist in all materials at some levels .",
    "the processing of the raw materials to csi(tl ) crystals can preferentially introduce or remove certain isotopes within these series such that secular equilibrium can be destroyed .",
    "a sensitive measurement of the spatially and temporally - correlated events within the decay series in csi(tl ) crystals was performed .",
    "the measured activities were translated to contamination levels of their long - lived parent isotopes in the crystal . if secular equilibrium is assumed , the levels of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be derived .",
    "the identification of the events provides event - by - event background rejection to the candidate events for neutrino or dark matter - induced interactions . beyond that , they are extremely useful to perform _ in situ _ studies of detector performance parameters .",

    "various selection criteria for the decay sequences ds@xmath73 were devised and their efficiencies were measured , as summarized in table  [ dsselect ] . with the exception of the fast - cascade in ds@xmath74 , the events were identified as @xmath34 or e/@xmath38 ( i d ) ; the delayed events should be within four half - lives from the precedent ones ( @xmath75 t ) ; the measured energy of the @xmath34-events should match that of expectations from quenching factor measurements ( e@xmath76 ) while the correlated events should have the same z ( @xmath75z=0 ) .",
    "events from ds@xmath35 were identified by the convoluted @xmath33-@xmath34 pulse shapes .    .",
    "[ dsselect ] summary of the selection efficiencies , background levels and measured half - lives of the decay sequences .

    "in addition , the quenched pulses for @xmath34-particles have faster decay times compared to those from electrons / photons in crystal scintillators , as indicated in figure  [ psd ] , while the reverse is true for liquid scintillators .",
    "the quenching for nuclear recoils in csi(tl ) at the kev energy range is relevant to dark matter searches , and have been measured ( qf@xmath290.2 ) by various groups  @xcite .",

    "the variations of @xmath79 with @xmath80 are displayed in figure  [ fig : qf]b .",
    "the energy resolution is statistically - limited in four of the data points where @xmath81 .",
    "the worse resolution of the @xmath34 from @xmath4po in ds@xmath55 is due to its long half - life such that the sample is contaminated by accidental events .",
    "energy measurement of the @xmath5po-@xmath34 in ds@xmath37 is affected by the sampling procedures of this particular data acquisition system @xmath49 the pedestals for the delayed events within 500  @xmath28s of the primary trigger were not recorded and uncertainties were therefore introduced .",
    "measurement of the @xmath8po-@xmath34 in ds@xmath35 involves the de - convolution of the @xmath33-@xmath34 pulse shapes , which gives additional contributions to the energy resolution .      the longitudinal `` z - position '' of an event",
    "can be derived from the difference of the pmt signals between the _ left _ ( @xmath82 ) and _ right _",

    "this approach is limited by the intrinsic spread of the photon interaction sites within the crystal due to multiple compton scatterings .",
    "a better in situ method is through the study of the measured position difference ( @xmath75z ) of the correlated @xmath33-@xmath34 and @xmath34-@xmath34 pairs which are emitted at the same site .",
    "the @xmath75z distributions of @xmath33-@xmath34 from ds@xmath37 and the two @xmath34-@xmath34 pairs from ds@xmath61 for the combined data are depicted in figure  [ deltaz]a&b .",

    "the resolution @xmath85 , as given by the rms of the distributions , are 2.2  cm and 1.3  cm for the @xmath33-@xmath34 and @xmath34-@xmath34 events , respectively , while the rms spread of @xmath85 among the crystal samples are 19% and 24% .",
    "the @xmath34-@xmath34 samples provide a more accurate description in the studies of the intrinsic spatial resolution , since both of the @xmath34-pairs are originated at the same site .",
    "the @xmath33-events in ds@xmath37 , on the other hand , are accompanied by other @xmath38-emissions such that their exact vertices are not well - defined .",

    "crystal growth is itself an purification process . as a result ,",
    "the impurity concentrations in the solution increase during the growth process , such that residual contaminations inside the crystals are expected to increase with the crystal growth axis .",

    "this behaviour is in contrast to the uniform z - position distribution of @xmath9cs shown in figure  [ cs137]b , since the trace contaminations in @xmath9cs can not be separated from the natural @xmath39cs by any chemical means .",
    "the event samples can also be used to measure or monitor the data acquisition dead time ( dt ) .",
    "the fraction dt/(1-dt ) is the ratio of recorded double-@xmath34 events in ds@xmath88 where the third one is missing to the triple-@xmath34 events where the entire sequence ds@xmath88 and ds@xmath89 are reconstructed .",

    "we report in this article measurements of the intrinsic radiopurity in csi(tl ) .",
    "in addition to energy measurements and particle identifications , the selection of spatially and temporally correlated event - pairs within the @xmath2 and @xmath3 series can greatly suppress accidental background and enhance the measurement capabilities .",
