    "in @xcite , morrison proposed that geometric transitions are reversed under mirror symmetry .",
    "a geometric transition is a birational contraction followed by a complex smoothing , or the reverse way , applied to a khler manifold .",
    "we will denote a geometric transition by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a birational contraction and @xmath2 is a smoothing .",
    "the conjecture can be formulated as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be calabi ",
    "yau manifolds , and suppose they are related by a geometric transition @xmath0 .",
    "suppose @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mirrors of @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "then there exists a geometric transition @xmath7 relating @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the survey article @xcite is an excellent review on geometric transitions and morrison s conjecture .",
    "the conjecture provides a method to construct mirrors by geometric transtions .",
    "for example , if the mirror @xmath6 of @xmath4 is known , and @xmath3 is related to @xmath4 by a geometric transition , then we may construct the mirror of @xmath3 by taking an appropriate geometric transition of @xmath6 .",
    "such a method ( restricted to conifold transitions ) was used by batyrev , ciocan - fontanine , kim and van straten @xcite to construct the mirrors of calabi  yau complete intersections in grassmannians .",
    "the present paper investigates mirror symmetry for geometric transitions of two specific types of local singularities , namely generalized conifolds and orbifolded conifolds .",
    "the mirror symmetry of these singularities turns out to be a natural extension of mirror symmetry of the conifold .",
    "recall that a conifold is an isolated singularity defined by @xmath8 .",
    "it is an important class of singularity appearing in algebraic geometry and also plays a special role in superstring theory . a folklore mirror symmetry of the conifold @xcite that the deformed conifold is mirror symmetric to the resolved conifold can be refined in the framework of syz mirror symmetry as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 be the resolved conifold with a smooth anti - canonical divisor @xmath10 removed , and @xmath11 the deformed conifold with the anti - canonical divisor @xmath12 removed",
    ". then @xmath3 and @xmath4 are syz mirror to each other .",
    "although removing the divisors certainly does not affect the local geometry of the singularity , it is important for defining wrapped fukaya categories and homological mirror symmetry .",
    "we now focus on two natural generalizations of the conifold : generalized conifolds and orbifolded conifolds . for integers @xmath13 ,",
    "a generalized conifold is given by @xmath14 and an orbifolded conifold is given by @xmath15 ( we have made a change of coordinates , namely @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for later convenience . )",

    "the mirror duality of @xmath21 and @xmath24 has previously been studied by physicists aganagic , karch , lust and miemiec in @xcite , where they use gauge theory and brane configurations .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use the framework introduced by the second author with chan and leung @xcite for defining syz mirror pairs .",
    "namely , generating functions of open gromov ",
    "witten invariants of fibers of a lagrangian fibration were used to construct the complex coordinates of the mirror .",
    "the essential ingredient is wall - crossing of the generating functions , which was first studied by auroux @xcite .",
    "we can also bypass symplectic geometry and employs the gross ",
    "siebert program @xcite which uses tropical geometry instead for defining mirror pairs .",
    "this approach was taken by castano - bernard and matessi @xcite in the study of mirror symmetry for conifold transitions for compact calabi ",
    "yau varieties . in this paper",
    "this would be unnecessary since symplectic geometry can be handled directly .",
    "one interesting feature of the present work is the dependence of the choice of a lagrangian fibration , namely the choice of a lagrangian fibration has to be compatible with the choice of an anti - canonical divisor in order to obtain the desired mirror .",
    "for example , the resolved generalized conifold @xmath29 admits two different lagrangian fibrations : the gross fibration and a ` doubled ' gross fibration constructed in this paper .",
    "the gross fibration is not compatible with the anti - canonical divisor @xmath32 , and hence does not produce the orbifold conifold as the mirror . choosing an appropriate lagrangian fibration is a key step in our work .",
    "another interesting feature is the involutive property of syz mirror symmetry .",
    "namely , taking syz mirror twice gets back to itself , which is an important point but often overlooked in literatures .",
    "we exhibit this feature by carrying out the syz construction for all the four directions in theorem [ maintheoremintro ] , namely from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and from @xmath30 back to @xmath29 ; from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , and from @xmath28 back to @xmath27 .",
    "syz from @xmath29 to @xmath30 is a bit tricky and we will discuss it in details .",
    "we employ the techniques of syz constructions developed in @xcite .",
    "lastly , theorem [ maintheoremintro ] not only unveils a connection between geometric transitions and syz mirror symmetry , but also yields many interesting problems and conjectures that naturally extend what is known for the conifolds .",
    "section [ genorbconi ] introduces generalized conifolds and orbifolded conifolds and basic properties thereof .",
    "section [ syz ] begins with a review on lagrangian torus fibrations and the syz program .",
