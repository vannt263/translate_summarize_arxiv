    "therefore the surface of liquid mercury serves as a model system for the experimental study of universal ( free of the underlying crystal substrate ) properties of numerous organic films @xcite .",

    "[ fig : free_en_eam_density ] ) , which in turn stems from the form of the embedding energy @xmath47 of the eam2013 model compared to the eam2006 one ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phi_of_rho_eam ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , as we see from the md simulations , which are confirmed by the lst arguments , all the possible coexistences at lower densities are preempted by the liquid - vapor coexistence at the liquid hg density of 13 g/@xmath11 , and such a peculiar form of @xmath47 of the eam2013 model has basically no qualitative effect neither on the correct thermodynamics of coexistence nor on the surface tension .",
    "the coexistence density thus obtained for the eam2006 model from the double tangent construction is accordingly 12.8 g/@xmath11 . for the comparison the free energy without the embedded energy contributions",
    "is also depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_en_eam ] .",
    "the agreement with the results of the atomistic md simulations is remarkably good , given the simplicity of the lst approximations .",
    "the effective hard sphere diameter for both eam models is independent of density and comprises 2.96  .        to increase the reliability of the predictions from the embedded - atom models for liquid hg one could attempt to fit the embedding energy to the recent experimental results for the equation of state of liquid hg @xcite .",
    "one could also try to adopt a modified embedded - atom method ( meam ) @xcite to the liquid mercury , where the non - uniform angle distribution of density is taken explicitly into account .",
    "alternatively , one could adopt a systematically modified embedded - atom method ( smeam ) @xcite , which implicitly accounts for the angle dependence .",
    "in the present article we have assessed the ability of various state dependent ( either through temperature or density ) interaction models to predict the surface tension of liquid mercury at @xmath1  k. since density - dependent models generally require more computational efforts we have optimized a density - independent force field in order to increase the value of the surface tension while preserving the experimental coexistence density .",
    "the optimization procedure is outlined in detail .",
    "we came to a conclusion that all the models treated in the current work are capable of reproducing the essential unique properties of the surface of liquid hg , namely a densely packed liquid phase in coexistence to vapor and a high surface tension ( compared to lennard - jones systems ) , which is responsible for the seamless surface and exceptional non - wetting behavior of liquid hg droplets at @xmath1  k. our study , however , also indicates that it remains a challenge to devise density - independent models that simultaneously yield the experimental values of coexistence density and surface tension . in particular cases one has to treat with additional care the empirical density dependence of interactions .",
    "one can use the liquid state theory as a convenient tool to qualitatively explore the effects due to the density dependence prior to starting a computationally costly atomistic or coarse - grained computer simulation .",
