    "disks around young stars are a natural outcome of the star formation process and the place for planet formation . at the present time",
    ", a significant effort has been done on the study of the dust in disks .",
    "however , the dust only represents a tiny fraction of the disk mass ( @xmath41% ) , and it is thus mandatory to deeply study the gas phase in disks in order to set stronger constraints on the giant planets formation process . molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 )",
    "is the most abundant molecule in the circumstellar ( cs ) environments of young stars and is supposed to be the key element of giant planet formation , thus its diagnostics are promising .",
    "indeed , the detection of h@xmath0 provides the most direct information about the gaseous content of disks , setting limits on the timescales for the dissipation of cs matter and possibly planet building .",
    "h@xmath0 has been observed in cs environments at ultraviolet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and near - infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) wavelengths .",
    "these observations trace hot circumstellar gas , or gas excited by fluorescent processes , or require specific spatial distributions for the gas to be detectable .",
    "they are therefore difficult to translate into gas masses .",
    "the pure rotational mid - infrared h@xmath0 lines are useful probes because the level populations are expected to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) at the local gas temperature , and so line ratios allow determination of the excitation temperature and mass of the warm gas .",
    "is a nearby , relatively isolated herbig a0/b9 star , surrounded by a cs disk , located in the chameleon cloud at a distance of 180 pc @xcite .",
    "its age has been estimated from evolutionary tracks to be of the order of 3 myrs ( kindly computed for us by l. testi and a. palacios ) .",
    "the _ visir _  ( _ vlt imager and spectrometer for the mid - infrared _ ; * ? ? ? * ) imaging observations of this star have revealed emission of pahs ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) at the surface of a flared disk extending at least up to 370 au @xcite . the flaring index has been measured to be 1.26@xmath50.05 , which is in good agreement with hydrostatic flared disk models @xcite .",
    "this is the only herbig star for which the flaring of the disk has been observed by direct imaging .",
    "this geometry implies that a large amount of gas should be present to support the hydrostatic structure and that the disk is at an early stage of evolution .",
    "this star is thus one of the best candidates to study the gas component in the disks of haes .    in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , we presented _ visir _  high - resolution spectroscopic mid - infrared observations of the circumstellar disk around the herbig ae ( hae ) star hd  97048 near 17.03 @xmath1 m .",
    "although @xcite suggested , from their disk model with the assumptions of lte conditions and gas - to dust ratio of about 100 , that mid - ir h@xmath0 lines should not be detected with the existing instruments , we detected the s(1 ) pure rotational line of molecular hydrogen at 17.035 @xmath1 m arising from the disk around hd  97048 .",
    "in addition , @xcite have detected mid - ir h@xmath0 rotational lines in the disk of another herbig star , namely ab aur , using the high spectral and spatial resolution texes spectrometer .",
    "these detections demonstrate that h@xmath0 can be observed in the mid - ir domain when particular physical conditions exist in disks .    despite the fact",
    "that the line is neither spatially nor spectrally resolved , the detection of the s(1 ) line in the disk of hd  97048 revealed the presence of significant amounts of warm gas in the inner 35 au of the disk .",
    "circumstellar gas had been previously detected in the disk of hd  97048 by @xcite , who showed that the [ o  i ] emission arises at radii between 0.5 and 60 au from the central star .",
    "very recently , modeling of near - infrared co emission showed that the inner radius of the co emitting region is located at 12 au from the star @xcite .",
    "these observations reinforced the claim that the disk of hd  97048 contains large amounts of gas both at small and large radii , as suggested by the flaring geometry , and that hd  97048 is a young object surrounded by a disk at an early stage of evolution .",
    "indeed photoevaporation of the gas and planet formation clear up the inner part of the disk in timescales expected to be lower than 3 million years @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 s(1 ) line detection also implies that particular physical conditions for h@xmath0 are present in the inner disk surface layer .",
    "the analysis of these data usually assumes that the h@xmath0 excitation is in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , and can itself thus be characterized by a single excitation temperature , which should be close to the gas temperature because of the low critical densities . as shown by the ab aur observations @xcite",
    ", the h@xmath0 gas temperature could be significantly higher than the dust temperature in the disk surface layers of hd  97048 , due to the dust settling or coagulation , for example .",
    "however , several competing mechanisms could contribute to the excitation of molecular hydrogen such as uv and x - rays heating , shocks , etc ... , ( see review papers by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and could be responsible for the observed emission .",
    "we refer the reader to paper  i for a complete discussion about the different possible explanations .",
    "the detection of the other pure rotational lines of h@xmath0 is a potentially powerful tool to determine the excitation temperature ( and thus the mass ) of the warm gas , and better constrain the excitation of h@xmath0 . in this paper , we thus present _ visir _  high - resolution spectroscopic observations of the two other pure rotational lines of h@xmath0 observable from the ground : the s(2 ) line at 12.2786 @xmath1 m , and the s(4 ) line at 8.0250 @xmath1 m .",
    "we also recall the main results obtained from the s(1 ) line detection ( detailed in paper  i ) .",
    "hd  97048 was observed at 3 different epochs .",
    "the observations at 17.035 @xmath1 m presented in the paper  i were performed in 2006 june 22 , the 8.025 @xmath1 m observations in 2007 april 07 , and the 12.278 @xmath1 m observations in 2007 july 03 .",
    "the three sets of observations were obtained with the high - resolution spectroscopic mode of _ visir_. the exposure time , slit width , and atmospheric conditions during the observations for the target star and standard references are presented in table  [ tab_obs ] .",
    "for all the three observations , the standard chopping and nodding technique was used to suppress the large sky and telescope background dominating at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "asteroids and standard stars were observed just before and after observing hd  97048 , at nearly the same airmass and seeing conditions as the object . in order to correct the spectra from the earth s atmospheric absorption , we divided each spectrum of hd  97048 by that of the corresponding asteroid ( which has a much better signal - to - noise ratio than that of the standard star ) , and used the standard stars observed and modeled spectra @xcite to obtain the absolute flux calibration . in order to verify our flux calibration",
    ", we checked the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ archives .",
    "hd  97048 was observed with the irs spectrograph installed onboard the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ as part of the `` cores to discs '' ( c2d ) legacy program ( aor:0005644800 , pi : evans ) .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the _ c2d _ legacy team pipeline @xcite with the s15.3.0 pre - reduced ( bcd ) data .",
    "the absolute flux calibration of our _ visir _",
    "data in the 3 wavelength ranges has been performes in order to be consistent with the _ spitzer _ flux measurements .",
    "we estimate the error on the absolute flux calibration to be lower than 10% , a value which does not affect our analysis .",
    "the wavelength calibration is done by fitting the observed sky background features with a model of paranal s atmospheric emission ( for more details on the observation and data reduction techniques see paper  i ) .",
    "we note that a@xmath6= 0.24 mag for hd  97048 @xcite , thus we have not corrected the spectra for dust extinction , since it is negligible in our wavelength range for any a@xmath6@xmath7 40 mag @xcite .",
    "hd  97048 spectra show no evidence for h@xmath0 emission neither at 12.278 @xmath1 m nor at 8.025 @xmath1 m ( fig .",
    "[ hd97 ] , middle and bottom panels ) . for each flux - calibrated spectrum",
    ", we calculated the standard deviation ( @xmath8 ) for wavelength ranges relatively unaffected by telluric absorption , and close to the wavelength of interest .",
    "the 3@xmath8 upper limits on the integrated line fluxes were calculated by integrating over a gaussian of fwhm equal to a spectral resolution element ( 21 kms@xmath9 ) and an amplitude of about 3@xmath8 flux ( fig .",
    "[ hd97 ] ) .",
    "we assumed the same radial velocity for the s(2 ) and s(4 ) lines than that observed for the s(1 ) line and corrected appropriately for each epoch of observation .",
    "we thus centered the gaussian on the expected wavelengths for the s(2 ) and s(4 ) lines respectively ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) . from the limits on integrated intensities , we estimated the upper limits on the column densities of the corresponding upper rotational levels of each h@xmath0 transition ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , we first assumed that the line is optically thin and that the radiation is isotropic . in this context , the column densities are derived from the following formula @xcite :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the integrated intensity of the line , @xmath12 is the wavelength of the transition @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the spontaneous transition probability , @xmath15 is the column density of the upper rotational level of the transition .",
    "we recall here the results of our analysis of the s(1 ) line . for more details ,",
    "we refer the reader to the paper  i. as shown in fig .",
    "[ hd97 ] ( top panel ) , we have detected the h@xmath0 pure rotational s(1 ) line near 17.03 @xmath1 m . in the flux - calibrated spectrum , the standard deviation ( @xmath8 ) of the continuum flux was calculated in regions less influenced by telluric absorption , and close to the feature of interest .",
    "we deduced a 6@xmath8 detection in amplitude for the line , corresponding to a signal - to - noise ratio of about 11@xmath8 for the line , when integrating the signal over a resolution element ( 6 pixels ) .",
    "the line is not spectrally resolved as we can fit it with a gaussian with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) equal to a spectral resolution element of 21 kms@xmath9(fig .",
    "[ hd97 ] ) . from our fit , we derived the integrated flux in the line ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) . once the spectrum is corrected from the earth s rotation , and knowing the heliocentric radial velocity of hd  97048 ( + 21 kms@xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimated , from the wavelength position of the gaussian peak , the radial velocity of h@xmath0 to be about 4@xmath52 kms@xmath9  in the star s rest frame .",
    "we thus considered that the radial velocity of the h@xmath0 is compatible with zero ( at the _ visir _  resolution ) and therefore similar to that of the star , implying that the emitting gas is gravitationally bound to the star , and likely arising from the disk and not from an outflow .",
    "outflows from t tauri stars usually have ( blueshifted ) velocities of a few tens up to a hundred of kms@xmath9  when a clear outflow is identified .",
    "otherwise , when the line is detected at zero systemic velocity and is narrow or unresolved as is the case here , it is generally attributed to the disk . the h@xmath0 line is not resolved spatially either .",
    "given the _",
    "visir _  spatial resolution of about 0.427  at 17.03 @xmath1 m , and the star distance ( 180 pc from the sun ) , we can assess that the emitting h@xmath0 is located within the inner 35 au of the disk .",
    "assuming that the h@xmath0 gas follows the same ( keplerian ) kinematics as the disk , the emitting gas observed with _",
    "visir _  is likely not concentrated significantly in the innermost au of the disk ( @xmath7 5  au ) otherwise rotational broadening would be observed .",
    "indeed , near the central star , the rotational velocity of the disk is of the order of a hundred of kms@xmath9 , to be compared to the spectral resolution of visir , 21 kms@xmath9 .",
    "the emitting h@xmath0 is thus more likely distributed in an extended region within the inner disk , between 5  au and 35  au of the disk .",
    "assuming the emission arises from an isothermal mass of optically thin h@xmath0 , we estimated the corresponding column densities and masses of h@xmath0 as a function of prescribed temperatures ( for 150  k , 300  k and 1000  k ; see paper  i for details about the method ) . in table",
    "[ tab_flux ] are reported the integrated flux of the s(1 ) line , its intensity , and the corresponding column density for the @xmath16 rotational level .",
    "since we have a signal - to - noise ratio of about 11@xmath8 for the line , we can deduce 9% error bars on theses values ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) .",
    "the estimates of the column densities of the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 rotational levels of h@xmath0 allowed us to plot the excitation diagram of h@xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ diag_ex ] ) . assuming that all three levels are populated by thermal collisions ( lte )",
    ", we estimated the excitation temperature of the observed gas .",
    "the upper limit on the column density of the @xmath18 level strongly constrains the value of the column density of the @xmath17 level .",
    "indeed , the population of the @xmath17 level should correspond to the excitation temperature given by the ratio of the column densities of the @xmath16 and @xmath18 levels .",
    "we assumed that the population of the @xmath16 and @xmath18 levels follow the boltzmann law , which corresponds to a linear fit to the points on the excitation diagram ( fig .",
    "[ diag_ex ] ) :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the column density , @xmath21 is the statistical weight , and @xmath22 is the energy of the @xmath23 level ; @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath25 is the temperature defined as the excitation temperature .",
    "since we only have upper limits on the column densities of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 levels , only an upper limit on the excitation temperature is relevant . since the temperature is inversely proportional to the slope on the excitation diagram , in order to obtain the upper limit on the excitation temperature , we considered the lower value of the column density of the @xmath16 level ( i.e. , the measured value minus 1@xmath8 ) and the upper limit on the @xmath18 population level ( that procedure yields the minimum slope / maximum temperature and corresponds to the solid line on fig .",
    "[ diag_ex ] ) .",
    "we thus find that the excitation temperature of h@xmath0 should be lower than 570  k. in this case , the column density of the @xmath17 level should be lower than 1.6@xmath2610@xmath27 @xmath28 which is lower than the value obtained from the 3@xmath8 upper limit ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) .    under the assumption that the h@xmath0 emission is optically thin , that the emitting h@xmath0 is in lte at a temperature of about 570  k , and that the source size is equal or smaller than _ visir _ s beam size , we derived upper limits on the h@xmath0 mass ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the line flux , @xmath31 the distance in pc to the star , @xmath32 is the fractional population of the level @xmath33 at the temperature @xmath34 in lte ( for details on the calculation method , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath35 is the conversion factor required for deriving the total h@xmath0 gas mass from the h@xmath0-ortho or h@xmath0-para mass . since m@xmath36=m@xmath36(ortho)+m@xmath36(para ) , then @xmath35 = 1 + 1/(ortho / para ) for the s(1 ) line ( a h@xmath0-ortho transition ) and @xmath35 = 1+ortho / para for the s(2 ) and s(4 ) lines ( h@xmath0-para transitions ) .",
    "the equilibrium ortho - para ratio at the temperature t was computed using eq.(1 ) from @xcite .",
    "our previous high - resolution spectroscopic observations with _ visir_of the s(1 ) pure rotational line of h@xmath0 at 17.035 @xmath1 m of hd  97048 revealed the presence of significant amounts of warm gas in the surface layer of the disk in the inner 35 au from the central star ( paper  i ) .",
    "this detection confirmed that hd  97048 is a young object surrounded by a circumstellar disk at an early stage of evolution , still rich in gas .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the non - detections of the s(2 ) and s(4 ) lines of h@xmath0 in the disk of the herbig ae star hd  97048 . using _ visir _",
    "high - resolution spectra , we compute upper limits for the column densities of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 rotational levels . using the results obtained from the analysis of the s(1 ) line ( column density of the @xmath16 level ) , and assuming that the @xmath16 to @xmath18 levels are excited by thermal collisions we derive an upper limit on the excitation temperature of h@xmath0 of about 570  k.    this constraint on a temperature lower than 570  k for the gas allows us to set a stronger constraint on the mass of warm h@xmath0 ( @xmath7 0.1 m@xmath3 ; 1 m@xmath3 @xmath4 10@xmath37 m@xmath38 ) in the inner 35 au of the disk than that estimated in paper  i. indeed , in paper  i , we derived masses of the warm gas in the range from 10@xmath39 to nearly 1 m@xmath3 , for temperatures in the range from 150  k to 1000  k and assuming lte .",
    "the mass of warm gas we estimate is also lower than that we derived from the paper by @xcite who estimated the mass of h@xmath0 in the disk to be of about 0.01 m@xmath38 . by assuming that the surface density @xmath40 follows a power law @xmath41 with an index q equal to @xmath42 @xcite , we estimated in paper  i a minimum mass of gas in the inner 35 au of the disk to be of the order of 3 m@xmath43 .",
    "but it should be pointed out that mid - ir h@xmath0 lines are only probing warm gas located in the surface layer of the disk , when a higher mass of colder gas is expected to be present in the interior layers of the disk .",
    "however , from their disk model , @xcite concluded that the expected peak flux of the s(1 ) line at 17.035 @xmath1 m , observed at a spectral resolution of 20000 , should be less than 0.3%  of that of the continuum at temperatures higher than 150 k , and thus should not be observable with the existing instruments .",
    "those authors used a two - layer model @xcite of a gas - rich disk ( column density of n(h@xmath0)=10@xmath44 @xmath28 ) seen face - on , located at 140 pc from the sun , with lte for the gas and dust , t@xmath45=t@xmath46 , and assumed a constant gas - to - dust mass ratio about 100 .",
    "as shown in paper  i from the observation of the s(1 ) line in the disk of hd  97048 , such a detection can only be explained if the physical conditions of the gas differ from those used by @xcite . in paper",
    "i , we proposed several ways to explain our detection .",
    "first , assuming equal dust and gas temperatures ( lte ) , we estimated gas - to - dust mass ratios much larger than the canonical value of 100 .",
    "this hypothesis can not be ruled out by the non - detections of the s(2 ) and s(4 ) lines . one possible interpretation to explain",
    "a very high gas - to - dust ratio is that the dust is partially depleted from the uppermost disk surface layer , where the h@xmath0 emission originates .",
    "the spatial decoupling between the gas and the dust may be due to low densities in the surface layers , or dust settling and coagulation into larger particles .",
    "the physical conditions may thus rapidly differ from the lte ones , i.e. @xmath47 . in the upper disk surface layers ,",
    "photoelectric heating can thus play a significant role in the gas heating process @xcite .",
    "in addition , photoelectric heating will be much efficient on small grains , such as pahs , which show significant features in the different observations of hd  97048 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "our upper limit on the excitation temperature is consistent with photoelectric heating .",
    "indeed , as shown by @xcite , photoelectric heating is characterized by a temperature limit ( @xmath41000  k ) since for high stellar uv flux , grain ionization can be so large that the photoelectric effect is less efficient and @xmath48 does not increase anymore .",
    "however , our observations do not allow us to rule out the possibility of a gas heating due to other excitation mechanisms such as uv pumping or x - ray heating .",
    "indeed , uv and x - ray heating are likely possibilities that can heat the gas to temperatures signicantly hotter than the dust .",
    "@xcite modeled uv heating of circumstellar disks around t tauri stars and the resulting h@xmath0 emission . in their model the temperature",
    "can be of about 1000  k at 10 au from the central star , and the predicted h@xmath0 s(2 ) line flux is about 2@xmath2610@xmath49 ergss@xmath9@xmath28 .",
    "this value is lower than our upper limit on the s(2 ) line flux , but their model was for a less massive star and disk .",
    "the upper limit on the excitation temperature of about 570  k we found for h@xmath0 in the disk of hd  97048 , could also be consistent with x - ray heating .",
    "very recently , @xcite demonstrated from their two - dimensional photoionization and dust radiative transfer models of a disk irradiated by x - rays from a t tauri star , that the uppermost layers of gas in the disk could reach temperatures of 10@xmath50  k at small radii ( @xmath70.1 au ) and 10@xmath51  k at a distance of 1 au .",
    "the gas temperatures decrease sharply with depth , but appear to be completely decoupled from dust temperatures down to a column depth of @xmath45@xmath2610@xmath52 @xmath28 .",
    "these results are consistent with those of @xcite who computed that at 20 au from the central star , the temperature can reach 3000  k at the surface of the disk before dropping to 500 - 2000  k in a transition zone and then to much cooler temperatures deep in the disk . by extrapolation , these models suggest that in the inner 35 au from the central star , the upper layers of the disk could reach temperatures consistent with the upper limit of about 570  k we find for hd  97048 .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the gas is generally supposed to be given by the population of the first rotational levels ( namely @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) since their critical densities are relatively low , and can not be higher than the excitation temperature given by the higher energy levels .",
    "thus , in any case , even if the h@xmath0 we observe around hd  97048 is not essentially excited by thermal collisions , the populations of the three levels derived from our observations give strong constraints on the gas kinetic temperature .",
    "our upper limit on the temperature of about 570  k is thus reliable whatever the mechanisms responsible for the excitation of the observed gas .",
    "we stress that the excitation temperature we find for h@xmath0 from the _ visir _",
    "observations of hd  97048 is close to that derived from the texes observations of ab aur ( 670  k ) by @xcite , which reinforces the similarities between the two stars ( see paper  i ) .    in order to better constrain the physical conditions of h@xmath0 , high - sensitivity and high - resolution space - based spectrographs in the mid - ir",
    "would be required ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , only the observation of the s(0 ) emission line near 28@xmath1 m would allow us to clearly constrain both the kinetic temperature of the observed gas and the physical mechanisms responsible its excitation .",
