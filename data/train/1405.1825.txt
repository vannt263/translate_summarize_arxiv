    "the concept of proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration emerged five years ago @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for using protons is that the energy content of state - of - the - art proton beams is sufficiently high to bring a substantial amount of electrons to tev energy scale in a single plasma section .",
    "since plasmas can support extremely strong accelerating fields @xcite , this concept may open a path to the future of high - energy particle physics @xcite .    in the initial proposal @xcite ,",
    "the proton beam was assumed to be longitudinally compressed to the sub - millimeter length . that was necessary for driving the plasma wave with the wavelength of 1 mm or shorter .",
    "however , as available proton beams have lengths of about 10 cm , such strong compression seems unrealistic to obtain with conventional techniques @xcite .",
    "soon it was realized that the plasma wave can slice the initially long proton beam into the train of equally spaced micro - bunches which in turn resonantly drives the plasma wave @xcite .",
    "the slicing is caused by the saturated self - modulation instability @xcite .    .",
    "parameters of the baseline awake scenario and the notation . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to quantify the sensitivity of wakefield phase to parameter variations , we introduce the phase sensitivity @xmath0 as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the shift of some constant phase point .",
    "the phase curves may change in a complicated way due to variations of beam or plasma parameters , as exemplified by fig.[f8-phases ] . for most curves ,",
    "the strongest phase deviation is located near the amplitude maximum ( at @xmath3 m ) , while at the end of the plasma section the phase shift is small .",
    "we therefore calculate @xmath0 in two plasma cross - sections : @xmath4 m and @xmath5 m . to this end",
    "we take the local maximum of @xmath6 located at @xmath7 cm .",
    "phase sensitivities listed in table  [ t3 ] display several noticeable features .",
    "the most flaring one is the high sensitivity to plasma density variations . as shown in ref.@xcite , a small density variation @xmath8 results in the relative change @xmath9 of the plasma wavelength and the forward shift of the wakefield pattern by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance between the observation point and the area of wakefield formation .",
    "this distance was not defined strictly in ref.@xcite , and the phase sensitivity can be used to refine the definition . here",
    "@xmath12 cm , so the full distance to the seed laser pulse is the `` effective '' wakefield length if the beam self - modulates in the plasma of a detuned density .",
    "this contrasts to the case considered in ref.@xcite , where an already modulated beam enters a perturbed density plasma , and @xmath11 is roughly twice shorter .",
    "the extreme phase sensitivity to plasma density variations makes it challenging to deterministically inject externally generated short electron bunches into the wakefield of self - modulating proton beam .",
    "assume that the bunch must be placed into a certain accelerating bucket with a longitudinal precision of about @xmath13 .",
    "then it straightforwardly follows that the plasma density must be held to a designated value within @xmath14% .",
    "another noticeable feature is that all other sensitivities are small at @xmath5 m .",
    "values less than unity means that even a twofold change of a parameter moves a fixed phase point by a small fraction of the wakefield period .",
    "thus the wakefield structure established after partial destruction of micro - bunches is well phase locked to the seed perturbation .    at @xmath4 m sensitivities to beam population , beam length at fixed current , and beam radius are high since these parameters determine the beam density @xmath15 which in turn governs the theoretically predicted phase velocity @xmath16 of the growing self - modulation mode @xcite : @xmath17 from ( [ e7 ] ) we may expect @xmath18 to relate as @xmath19 .",
    "this reasonably agrees with the simulations except for the sensitivity to the beam energy which is roughly twice lower .",
    "note also the relatively high sensitivity to the atomic weight of plasma ions at @xmath4 m . in comparison to the amplitude sensitivity",
    "this shows that ion motion manifests itself much stronger in phase shifts than in the amplitude change .",
    "the performed study has not only clarified the sensitivity of the excited wakefield to beam and plasma parameters ( summarized in table  [ t3 ] ) , but also helped to identify physical effects limiting the wakefield amplitude in different parts of the parameter space .",
    "the most important effect is the nonlinear elongation of the wakefield period @xcite . as long as this effect has not come into play ,",
    "the wakefield amplitude is directly proportional to the number of protons driving the wakefield .",
    "once the limit is achieved by improving some of the parameters , further growth of the accelerating field drastically slows down .",
    "two other important effects are emittance driven divergence and motion of plasma ions .",
    "both effects are characterized by some threshold values or , to be exact , surfaces in the multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "if the threshold is crossed , the wakefield amplitude rapidly drops .",
    "if not , there is no influence on the wakefield amplitude .",
    "the baseline parameter set of the awake experiment ( table  [ t1 ] ) falls exactly at the onset of nonlinear period elongation and close to thresholds of emittance driven divergence and ion motion . in other words , this is the point beyond which efforts in increasing beam charge or peak current will not result in the proportional increase of the wakefield amplitude .",
    "also there is no much safety margin in beam emittance and ion weight .",
    "a way to stronger wakefields may probably be opened by operating at lower beam emittances and higher plasma densities , but this is a subject of a separate study .",
    "very high sensitivity of the wakefield phase to plasma density variations stimulates interest in injection methods based on selective trapping of electrons from an initially long ( several wavelengths ) beam @xcite .",
    "the authors are grateful to participants of awake collaboration for stimulating discussions .",
