    "in nuclear , atomic , and chemical physics , it is often useful to introduce an effective interaction acting in a chosen model space ( p space ) of tractable dimension . in nuclear physics ,",
    "much effort has been made both as regards formal theories and their applications  @xcite .",
    "recently the effective interaction method has been applied to new fields of many - body physics , such as quantum dots  @xcite and many - boson systems  @xcite .    among many approaches , we here direct our attention to the krenciglowa - kuo ( kk )  @xcite and the lee - suzuki ( ls )  @xcite methods .",
    "these two methods are constructed in terms of the so called @xmath2-box as a building block of formulation .",
    "the kk approach has very simple structure and the effective interaction is obtained in an iterative way .",
    "if the iteration converges , in almost all numerical calculations , eigenvalues are given for the states which have the largest overlaps with the chosen model space .",
    "on the other hand , the ls method reproduces eigenvalues for the states which lie closest to the chosen unperturbed energy .",
    "originally the ls method had been presented to resolve the difficulty of divergence in the perturbation expansion .",
    "the ls method is rather complicated in structure and higher derivatives of the @xmath2-box with respect to starting energy are necessary if one wishes to obtain more accurate solutions .",
    "both of the two theories yield only certain of the true eigenvalues of the original hamiltonian .",
    "this restriction is not desirable . in a formal point of view",
    ", the @xmath2-box itself contains information regarding all of the true eigenvalues . for a given model space of dimension @xmath4",
    ", there would be a method of reproducing any @xmath4 eigenvalues among all the true eigenvalues .",
    "in many cases of applying the effective interaction theories an iteration or a recursion method has often been employed . in general , the convergence in such a method depends strongly on the properties of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath3 . in actual calculations",
    "the information on the true eigenstates is not given beforehand .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to control the convergence in the iteration . in many cases we can not know whether the iteration is convergent or not before starting calculations . even if the iteration converges , we do not know which eigenvalues are reproduced in all of the eigenvalues .",
    "another difficulty encountered in actual calculations is the pole problem .",
    "the @xmath2-box itself has poles at the energies which are the eigenvalues of @xmath3 in the complement space ( q space ) .",
    "the presence of poles causes often instability in numerical calculations .    we shall show that it is indeed possible to resolve these difficulties by introducing a new vertex function , @xmath0 , in place of the @xmath2-box by kuo _",

    "three steps of the calculations in the modified secant method are enough for yielding the results with accuracy to six decimal places . however , the convergence depends strongly on the choice of the starting energies @xmath165 .",
    "when the spacing of two solutions among @xmath43 and @xmath131 is very narrow , we need to draw graphs accurately enough for finding approximate values of @xmath166 to bracket each of the solutions .",
    "we have introduced a new vertex function called the @xmath50-box , which is an operaor defined in a model space and a function of an energy @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath50-box is constructed in terms of the @xmath2-box and its energy derivative originated by kuo _",
    "et al_. we have proved that a new expression of the effective interaction can be derived by replacing the @xmath2-box by the @xmath50-box in the kk method . with the @xmath50-box",
    "we have also introduced a set of scalar functions @xmath125 .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath50-box and the associated functions @xmath167 have the following properties :    1 .",
    "the true eigenvalues @xmath47 of the original hamiltonian @xmath3 can be given by the roots of a set of equations @xmath168 .",
    "these equations have the roots , as additional solutions , at the pole energies @xmath131 of the @xmath2-box .",
    "the @xmath50-box and the functions @xmath125 have no singularities even at the poles of the @xmath2-box , and they are well - behaved functions of @xmath1 .",
    "3 .   the derivatives of @xmath167 at the solutions for @xmath1 take two values , _",
    "i.e. _ , zero at the true eigenvalues @xmath43 of @xmath3 , and two at the pole energies @xmath131 .",
    "on the basis of the properties ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) , we have proposed a new iteration scheme written as @xmath156 .",
    "this iteration always converges and reproduces the true eigenvalues @xmath43 of @xmath3 .",
    "since the energy derivatives of @xmath125 at the solutions for @xmath43 are always zero , this method can be understood to be equivalent to the newton - raphson method used to solve non - linear equations .",
    "the newton - raphson iteration derives quadratic convergence .",
    "therefore , we can expect that this new iteration leads to fast convergence .",
    "we have carried out a test calculation and confirmed the quadratic convergence .    as another method for solving a set of equations @xmath168 ,",
    "we have proposed a new non - iterative method which we call the graphical method .",
    "the solutions of these equations can be obtained as the energies at the intersections of the graphs @xmath169 and @xmath127 . using the property ( iii ) we can classify the intersections into two parts , _",
    "i.e. _ , those for the solutions of the true eigenvalues @xmath43 and of the pole energies @xmath131 .",
    "these graphs make us possible to estimate roughly the positions of the roots . with approximate solutions obtained from the graphs we proceed to make more accurate calculations of the solutions , where we have employed a modified secant method which is a combined method of the secant and the newton - raphson methods .",
    "this method has been shown to provide a suitable scheme for obtaining accurate results if we start with approximate energies close to the solutions .",
    "we have made test calculations to assess the graphical method .",
    "we have confirmed numerically that the modified secant method reproduces successfully all the solutions , including the true eigenvalues @xmath43 of @xmath3 and the pole energies @xmath131 .",
    "the theoretical predictions in the property ( iii ) on the energy derivatives of @xmath125 are also verified numerically .",
    "we wish to note that the graphical method , implemented by the modified secant method , yields always convergent results , where we do not need any information on the eigenstates and/or the eigenvalues of @xmath3 such as p - space overlaps and/or energy spacings .",
    "we may conclude that the present approach , the graphical method with the vertex function @xmath0 , would be promising in resolving some of the difficulties in the derivation of the effective interaction .",
