    "how is the critical behaviour affected by the introduction of disorder ( usualy dilution or bond - randomness ) into a model ?",
    "the harris criterion @xcite states that @xmath5 , the scaling index of the operator corresponding to randomness at the pure system fixed point ( also called the crossover exponent ) is equal to @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the specific - heat and correlation length exponents of the pure model ) .",
    "thus the critical behaviour of the pure system is unaltered by disorder if @xmath9 , and altered when @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 the situation is marginal .",
    "renormalization - group methods ( namely expansion in the parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dimensionality ) , applied to n - component continuous spin models with weak quenched bond disorder@xcite , confirmed the harris criterion @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , it was found that for @xmath15 a new stable ` random ' fixed point with new exponents appears .",
    "for the case @xmath16 ( ising model ) the stability of an @xmath17 random fixed point was shown by jayaprakash and katz@xcite . for the @xmath18 ising model @xmath11 , and the operator corresponding to randomness is expected to be marginally relevant .    two partially conflicting theories by dotsenko and dotsenko@xcite ( dd ) and by shalaev@xcite , shankar@xcite , and ludwig@xcite ( ssl )",
    "were suggested for the @xmath18 ising model with small randomness .",
    "while both theories agreed on the divergence of the specific heat , e.g. @xmath19 conflicting predictions were made for other quantities like the magnetization @xmath20 and susceptibility @xmath21 .",
    "extensive monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations of dilute and random - bond ising models ( see a review in ref .",
    "and references therein ) helped to confirm the prediction on the specific heat .",
    "the other quantities were seen to behave ( as predicted by ssl ) , in essence , as in the pure model .",
    "the disordered @xmath22 ising model has been studied by means of mc simulations as well@xcite .",
    "less attention has been paid in recent times to other disordered systems such as random q - state potts models .",
    "kinzel and domany @xcite used a real - space migdal - kadanoff renormalization transformation for the random - bond potts model on the square lattice in two dimensions and found ( when @xmath23 ) a stable random fixed point with a reduced ( with respect to the pure model ) but positive @xmath24 . using methods of the same spirit , andelman and",
    "berker @xcite also found a random fixed point .",
    "for @xmath25 their calculation suggests @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "mc work on random q - state potts models has not been carried out , except for recent work on the bond - random two dimensional 8-state potts model@xcite , where randomness was shown to change the first order phase transition of the pure model into a second order one@xcite .",
    "novotny and landau ( nl)@xcite used mc simulations to study the two dimensional site - dilute baxter - wu@xcite model which is of the same universality class as the 4-state potts model .",
    "nl measured the exponents @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 which did not seem to depend on the amount of dilution .",
    "they could not determine whether the new stable fixed point is a @xmath18 random ising fixed point ( which is very similar to the pure ising fixed point ) or a new impure baxter - wu fixed point .    in this paper",
    "we address the effect of randomness on a critical line which connects the critical points of the @xmath18 ising and 4-state potts models . such is the critical line of the two dimensional ashkin - teller model@xcite on a square lattice .",
    "a convenient representation of the pure ashkin - teller ( at ) model is in terms of two ising spin variables , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , placed on every site of a lattice .",
    "denoting by @xmath35 a pair of nearest neighbor sites , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath36    \\label{eq : at1}\\ ] ] here @xmath37 is the strength of the interactions between neighboring @xmath38 and @xmath39 spins , and @xmath40 is a four - spin coupling ( throughout this article we absorb a factor of @xmath41 into the coupling constants ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the ferromagnetic at model is known in two dimensions from duality transformations and renormalization group studies@xcite .",
    "the three dimensional model has been studied as well@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram which we reviewed previously@xcite includes a line of critical points which connects the ising critical point at one end to the 4-state potts critical point at the other end . along this line",
    "the exponents vary continuously , and have been determined analytically @xcite , interpolating between their ising and four - state potts values . for instance , the crossover exponent connected with randomness @xmath14 changes smoothly from 0 at the decoupled ising point , to 1 at the 4-state potts point .",
    "therefore , according to the harris criterion , we expect randomness to be a relevant operator of varying strength in this regime of the at model , and expect the critical behaviour of the disordered model to differ from that of the pure model .",
    "the critical behaviour of the disordered at model has not been studied before , apart from a conjecture by alcaraz and tsallis @xcite as to the location of the critical manifold of the bond dilute at model .",
    "none the less the effect of disorder on the critical line of the baxter ( or symmetric 8-vertex ) model@xcite , which is isomorphic to the critical line of the at model@xcite , was considered .",
    "dd@xcite have extended their study of the disordered ising model to the baxter model , and found , for small disorder , the specific heat divergence to change from its pure form to the form of eq .",

    "[ sum ] we summarize our results .",
    "the model we wish to study is the _ random - bond _ at model ( rbat ) on a square lattice , which is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath46 \\;.",
    "\\label{eq : rbat}\\ ] ] the coupling constants @xmath47 and @xmath48 are chosen according to @xmath49    it seems quite natural ( the _ need _ for this comparison will be made clear at the end of this section ) to compare the rbat with the _ anisotropic _ at model ( aat ) with the same hamiltonian ( [ eq : rbat ] ) but with the couplings distributed as follows : @xmath50    spatial anisotropy is usualy known to be an irrelevant operator , that is , the critical behaviour of a model is unaltered by introduction of anisotropy .",
    "thus one expects that continuous variation of critical exponents will continue to exist on some critical manifold of the aat , as is the case for the isotropic ( or pure ) model .",
    "a duality transformation can be used to locate critical manifolds of the aat and rbat in a way we now present .",
    "consider an at system on a square lattice with spatially varying coupling constants ( the spatial variation can be due to anisotropy , or it can be due to randomness as we consider later ) .",
    "the dual lattice @xmath51 of the original square lattice @xmath52 is the square lattice whose sites are at the centers of the plaquettes of the original lattice . in figure",
    "[ fig : duality exp ] sites of @xmath52 are denoted by dots , while sites of @xmath51 are denoted by crosses .",
    "consider a bond of strength @xmath53 between two sites in @xmath52 . under duality",
    "it is mapped onto a bond of strength @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 is the duality transformation of the at model@xcite which we list in the appendix .",
    "the dual bond lies in the dual lattice @xmath51 , intersecting the original bond .",
    "this situation is depicted in figure [ fig : duality exp ] .",
    "the original bond of strength @xmath53 is depicted by the solid line while its dual is depicted by the dashed line .",
    "suppose the only spatial variation of the couplings is one of anisotropy .",
    "then an at system with couplings of strength @xmath56 in the horizontal direction and strength @xmath57 in the vertical direction , transforms under duality into an at system on the dual lattice @xmath51 with couplings of strength @xmath58 in the vertical direction and strength @xmath59 in the horizontal direction .",
    "the free energies of the original system and its dual have the same singular part , and therefore we can write @xmath60= f_{s}[(\\widetilde{k^{2}},\\widetilde{\\lambda^{2}}),(\\widetilde{k^{1 } } , \\widetilde{\\lambda^{1 } } ) ] \\ ; , \\label{eq : fs anidual}\\ ] ] where the first pair of couplings corresponds to the horizontal bonds , and the second pair to the vertical ones .",
    "the duality transformation @xmath55 is self - inverse .",
    "thus , an anisotropic at system with couplings @xmath61 $ ] such that @xmath62 , transforms under duality onto itself .",
    "so , there exists a two dimensional self - dual manifold ( it would help the reader to view the duality transformation as a mathematical mapping in the four dimensional space of couplings @xmath61 $ ] ) .",
    "the line of critical points of the isotropic at model lies within the subspace @xmath63 , defined by @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath63 is located between a decoupled ising model where @xmath65 and a four - state potts model with @xmath66 .",
    "two sub - areas of @xmath63 which map onto each other under duality are separated by a self dual line ( fulfilling @xmath67 ) .",
    "the assumption that @xmath63 contains only two phases , with a single phase transition between them(where @xmath68 is non - analytic ) leads to the conclusion that this phase transition must occur on the self - dual line . in this way",
    "the line of critical points of the isotropic at was located exactly@xcite .",
    "let us now consider the corresponding subspace , @xmath69 , of the aat for which @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath69 lies between an anisotropic decoupled ising subspace where @xmath72 and an anisotropic four - state potts subspace with @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath69 is invariant under duality since for @xmath74 we get ( see appendix ) @xmath75 .",
    "it follows also that the self dual plane @xmath70 , @xmath62 is included in the subspace we are considering .",
    "thus , again assuming that @xmath69 contains only two phases , with a single phase transition between them , we conjecture that the self dual plane is a plane of phase transitions ( this kind of argument was first used by fisch@xcite for the random - bond ising model , and later for potts models by kinzel and domany@xcite ) . since the space of couplings is four dimensional , while the self dual plane is only two dimensional , the self dual plane is only _ part _ of the three dimensional critical manifold in @xmath69 .",
    "notice that this is unlike the case of the potts model or any model with a single coupling constant where the self dual line is _ identical _ with the critical line .",
    "the argument that leads to locating the corresponding critical plane of the rbat is very similar to the one presented above , up to a subtle difference . consider a specific realization of a rbat on a square lattice with couplings @xmath76 distributed at random with probabilities @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "replacing each bond by its dual we get ( on the dual lattice ) a system with couplings @xmath58 and @xmath59 , distributed at random with probabilities @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this defines a one to one mapping under duality from the ensemble of realizations of @xmath79 $ ] rbat systems , onto the ensemble of the dual systems @xmath80 $ ] . under duality",
    "each bond is mapped onto the bond on the dual lattice which intersects the original bond ( see fig . [",
    "fig : duality exp ] ) .",
    "thus , the spatial distribution of the two types of bonds on the dual lattice is different from that of the original lattice .",
    "but since all spatial distributions have the same weight in their ensemble , there is a one to one correspondence of bond configurations in the two ensembles , and we can write : @xmath81= f_{s}[(\\widetilde{k^{1}},\\widetilde{\\lambda^{1}}),(\\widetilde{k^{2 } } , \\widetilde{\\lambda^{2}}),p ] \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : fs rbdual}\\ ] ] where it is understood that in calculating @xmath68 we average over all spatial bond distributions .",
    "choosing @xmath82 we find that there is a self dual manifold at @xmath62 .",
    "our ability to locate a self dual manifold for the case @xmath82 makes this choice of @xmath77 a convenient case for studying the rbat . viewing the duality transformation as a mathematical mapping in the space of couplings @xmath83 $ ] , it is identical to the duality transformation in the space of couplings @xmath84 $ ] of the anisotropic at model .",
    "thus all conclusions which were based on duality in sec .",
    "[ sec : duality ani ] apply here equally . following the logic of the previous subsection",
    "we conjecture that the subspace of the rbat for which @xmath70 , @xmath85 and @xmath82 includes in it a critical plane defined by @xmath70 , @xmath62 .    in order to study the effect of randomness on the at model",
    "we need a reference non - disordered system for comparison .",
    "when studying a specific rbat model with couplings @xmath83 $ ] it is not clear with which specific non - random at model with couplings @xmath53 should one compare .",
    "none the less a comparison with the corresponding aat model with couplings @xmath84 $ ] seems to be quite natural .",
    "consider the anisotropic model with bonds @xmath56 in the horizontal direction and bonds @xmath57 in the vertical direction .",
    "next , consider as a perturbation , changing a small fraction @xmath77 of the bonds in the horizontal direction into bonds of strength @xmath57 and the same fraction of bonds in the vertical direction into bonds of strength @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath77 increases all the way to @xmath82 the anisotropy disappears and the model is completely random .",
    "so , in a sense , the perturbation of randomness can take us continuously from the critical plane of the anisotropic model to the critical plane of the random model . in view of this simple picture",
    "we have performed simulations of the anisotropic and random - bond at models at several points on their self - dual planes described above .",
    "we indeed find the two planes to be critical . in the next section",
    "we give some details of the simulations .",
    "in ref . we described a cluster algorithm for the at model and tested its performance ( on the isotropic model ) .",
    "as explained there , the algorithm can be regarded from two different points of view .",
    "the conceptually simpler and faster ( though less general ) one is that of the wolff embedding idea@xcite .",
    "it is faster in the sense that its implementation on the computer runs faster since the freeze - delete procedure is less complicated .",
    "the main idea is to embed into the at model an ising model of space dependent couplings @xmath86 and simulate it using the sw@xcite or wolff@xcite procedure for the ising model . to be explicit ,",
    "consider the hamiltonian ( [ eq : rbat ] ) , and take the @xmath39 variables as fixed , so we can write @xmath87 @xmath88 represented by the second sum is a constant , and remembering that we are considering @xmath89 for all ( i , j ) ,  @xmath90 is a ferromagnetic ising model in the @xmath38 variables with couplings @xmath91 . simulating this ising model with any procedure that will maintain detailed balance with respect to @xmath90 and will not change the value of @xmath88 , will also maintain detailed balance with respect to @xmath92 .",
    "so we can use for example the sw@xcite or wolff@xcite procedure for the ising model .",
    "this by itself will maintain detailed balance but will not be ergodic since the @xmath39 variables will not be updated . obviously to update",
    "the @xmath39 variables the same process should be repeated , holding the @xmath38 variables fixed and simulating an ising hamiltonian with the @xmath39 variables . to summarize , our procedure goes as follows : choose at random whether to embed into the at hamiltonian an ising hamiltonian in the @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) spins .",
    "pick a random site in the lattice , grow a cluster of @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) spins , using the wolff single cluster procedure with the ising hamiltonian ( ( [ eq : at - is ] ) or the opposite one in case of a @xmath39 embedding ) , and flip it .",
    "all our simulations were performed at the critical plane defined by @xmath93 : \\ ; ( k^{2},\\lambda^{2})=(\\widetilde{k^{1}},\\widetilde{\\lambda^{1 } } ) \\;\\;,\\;\\ ; 0 \\leq \\lambda^{1 } \\leq k^{1 } \\;\\ }   \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : def rbs}\\ ] ] as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : rbat ] ( for the anisotropic model just omit the @xmath82 ) . for convenience",
    "we also use the following notation for the coupling constants : @xmath94    the first series of measurements were performed at five points @xmath95 , which we label as @xmath96 .",
    "these were chosen so as to interpolate between @xmath97 , which is an anisotropic ( or random - bond ) decoupled ising critical point , and @xmath98 , which is an anisotropic ( or random - bond ) four - state potts critical point .",
    "the points @xmath99 interpolate in a similar manner to the way in which the critical line of the pure at connects the pure decoupled ising critical point with the pure four - state potts critical point .",
    "thus we chose the five points @xmath100 to lie equidistantly on the line @xmath101 the slope @xmath102 was chosen so that the line ( [ eq : line ] ) lies parallel ( in the @xmath103 plane ) to the critical line of the pure at model , @xmath104 .",
    "note that once @xmath105 are defined , @xmath106 are defined through ( [ eq : def rbs ] , [ eq : def xz ] ) .",
    "we clearly have some freedom in our choice of @xmath107 , the decoupled ising couplings ; setting @xmath108 in ( [ eq : def rbs ] ) one gets @xmath109 as well .",
    "the remaining parameter , @xmath110 , is chosen so that ( see ( [ eq : def rbs ] ) )    @xmath111    since the extent of deviation from pure behavior is obviously determined not only by @xmath77 but also by the difference between the two sets of couplings , the ratio of @xmath112 was chosen so that randomness will be pronounced@xcite .    while ( [ eq : ratio1 ] ) defines the first simulation point @xmath113 , the fifth simulation point @xmath114 is chosen to be a four - state potts point lying at the intersection of the line ( [ eq : line ] ) with the four - state potts line @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 ) .",
    "the other three simulation points @xmath117 lie equidistantly on the line ( [ eq : line ] ) between @xmath118 and @xmath119 : @xmath120 thus the first series of points @xmath99 at which we made measurements @xmath121 is defined through equations ( [ eq : def rbs],[eq : def xz],[eq : ratio1],[eq : x1place ] ) and the definition of @xmath119 .",
    "two additional measurement points were intended to monitor the effect of varying the amount of randomness in the model on the critical behaviour . in order to define these two points",

    "typically we discarded at least @xmath150 spin configurations .",
