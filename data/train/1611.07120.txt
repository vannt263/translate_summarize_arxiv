    "the ambition to classify graph @xmath5-algebras  and their precursors , the cuntz - krieger algebras  goes back to the inception of the field .",
    "in fact , as recently highlighted in @xcite , enomoto , fujii and watatani already in @xcite showed by ad hoc methods how to classify all the simple cuntz - krieger algebras that may be described by a @xmath6-matrix , predating by more than a decade the classification result of rrdam ( @xcite ) covering all simple cuntz - krieger algebras .    with the classification problem resolved for all simple graph @xmath5-algebras around the turn of the millenium by the superposition of @xcite and @xcite due to the realization that any such @xmath5-algebra is either af or purely infinite , the quest for classification of graph @xmath5-algebras moved into the realm of non - simple classification , where it has been a key problem ever since .",
    "the endeavor has evolved in parallel with the gradual realization of what invariants may prove to be complete in the case when the number of ( gauge invariant ) ideals is finite and the algebrasin question are not stably finite . in this sense , the fundamental results obtained on the classification of certain classes of graph algebrasare playing a role parallel to the one played by @xcite as a catalyst for the kirchberg - phillips classification in @xcite .",
    "based on ideas pioneered by huang ( @xcite ) , the first two general results on the classification problem for nonsimple graph algebraswere obtained by rrdam in @xcite and by restorff in @xcite by very different methods .",
    "rrdam showed the importance of involving the full data contained in six - term exact sequences of the algebrasgiven and proved a very complete classification theorem while restricting the ideal lattice to be as small as possible : only one nontrivial ideal . in restorff",
    "s work , the ideal lattice was arbitrary among the finite ideal lattices , but as his method was to reduce the problem to classification of shifts of finite type and appeal to deep results by boyle and huang from symbolic dynamics ( @xcite , @xcite ) , only graph algebrasin the cuntz - krieger class were covered .",
    "subsequent progress has mainly followed the approach in @xcite ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and hence applies only to restricted kinds of ideal lattices but with few further restrictions on the nature of the underlying graphs .",
    "the case of purely infinite graph algebraswith finitely many ideals has been resolved ( very interestingly , by a different invariant than what we use here ) , in recent work by bentmann and meyer ( @xcite ) , but as summarized in @xcite there is not at present sufficient technology to take this approach much farther in the mixed cases than to algebraswith three or four primitive ideals .    in the paper at hand we close the classification problem for all unital graph algebras , following the strategy from @xcite as generalized by the authors in various constellations over a period of 5 years ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .      our method of proof , a substantial elaboration of key ideas from the authors earlier work along with key ideas from symbolic dynamics ( @xcite , @xcite ) , leads to a _ geometric _ classification , allowing us to conclude from a morita equivalence between a pair of graph algebras@xmath1 and @xmath2 that a sequence of basic moves on the graphs will lead from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in a way resembling the role of reidemeister moves on knots . the standard list of such moves , defining the notion of _ cuntz move equivalence _ , contain moves that are closely related to those defining flow equivalence for shift spaces , along with the so - called _ cuntz splice _ ( move  ) which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is a key corollary of the main result of the present paper that any stable isomorphism between two unital graph @xmath5-algebras _ of real rank zero _ can be realized by a cuntz move equivalence , but as demonstrated in @xcite , this is not generally the case .",
    "indeed , consider the graphs @xmath3 and @xmath4 from figure  [ fig : counterex - graph1 ] and [ fig : counterex - graph2 ] , respectively",

    ", we therefore need to come up with a new invariant move for graphs that do not define @xmath5-algebras of real rank zero . in definition",
    "[ def : hashmove ] , we define move  accomplishing this .",
    "the move applied to the graph @xmath4 can be seen in figure  [ fig : counterex - changed - graph2 ] , while we have applied move  to @xmath3 in figure  [ fig : counterex - changed - graph1 ] .",
    "it follows from the classical results of boyle and huang that the two graphs in figure  [ fig : counterex - changed ] are move equivalent , and using the results of @xcite , one can show that all the corresponding stabilized graph algebrasare stably isomorphic",

    "by invoking invariance of moves , the classification result follows as soon as one may infer from an isomorphism at the level of the invariants that there is a finite number of moves leading from one graph to another .",
    "we establish this by a substantial elaboration of the approach which led to the classification of flow equivalence of reducible shift spaces .",
    "apart from having to develop tools to deal with the moves  and , which have no counterpart in dynamics , we must also develop the theory for rectangular matrices to deal with graphs with singular vertices ( sinks and infinite emitters ) , and in fact this part of the proof takes up more than half of the volume of the paper .",
    "a detailed roadmap of the rather technical argument is provided in section [ section : outline ] below .      in most areas of classification of unital @xmath5-algebras the proofs that establish classification by @xmath0-theory up to",
    "stable isomorphism may be rather easily amended to conclude that isomorphism of the @xmath0-theory augmented with the class of the unit leads to exact isomorphism of the @xmath5-algebras .",
    "the classification of non - simple cuntz - krieger algebras is a notable exception to this rule , and indeed all of the foundational papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite had to leave the question of exact isomorphism open in spite of providing stable classification results . the problem , as crystallized in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 13 ) , was that the given classification results were not _",
    "strong _ ; it was not possible to infer that any given isomorphism at the level of the invariant would be realized by the isomorphismguaranteed by the classification results .",
    "an unexpected obstruction for obtaining strong classification was identified in @xcite , as indeed the full filtered @xmath0-theory fails to have this property even for cuntz - krieger algebras .",
    "this focused the efforts on establishing strong classification for the standard reduced invariant , and in @xcite , a complete description was given of the action on @xmath0-theory by the moves constituting cuntz move equivalence .",
    "after obtaining such a description for move as well , we are able to conclude that our classification result is indeed strong : every given isomorphism at the level of the invariant is in fact induced by the moves in an appropriate sense . by methods that by now are standard , we obtain exact classification whenever the given @xmath0-theoretical isomorphism preserves the class of the unit , answering ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 13 ) not just for the cuntz - krieger algebras of real rank zero considered by the second named author , but for all unital graph @xmath5-algebras .",
    "the final question 4 in @xcite asks if there exist larger nice classes than the real rank zero cuntz - krieger algebras for which filtered @xmath0-theory is a complete invariant , and we now know that this indeed is the case  even if one were unwilling to augment the invariant considered in @xcite by an order , the original version is complete for all unital graph @xmath5-algebras that are purely infinite . further , we now know that restorff s classification result may be applied to any pair of purely infinite @xmath5-algebras having the same invariant as cuntz - krieger algebras , since by recent work of bentmann , there are no _ phantom _ cuntz - krieger algebras ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "our work raises the question of whether phantom unital graph @xmath5-algebras exist , and we conjecture this to not be the case , at least when the real rank is zero .",
    "unital graph @xmath5-algebras are ubiquitous in modern operator algebra , and hence our classification result can be expected to have many immediate applications , not least because the approach presented in this paper shows that the isomorphism problem in this case is decidable  indeed , for any pair of graphs there are concrete algorithms to reduce the problem to one concerning the existence of a pair of invertible integer matrices on a certain block form which intertwine the adjacency matrices of the graphs .",
    "we give two concrete applications , addressing the uniqueness question for quantum lens spaces , and confirming the abrams - tomforde conjecture in the unital case .    in conclusion ,",
    "let us briefly discuss the status of the classification problem for general ( not necessarily unital ) graph @xmath5-algebras with finitely many ( gauge invariant ) ideals . since we see no obvious way to reduce to the unital case solved here , nor to mimic the geometric approach which is essential for our proof , it stands to reason that entirely different methods are going to be necessary .",
    "it is worth noting that complete classification results exist in the case where all simple subquotients are of the same type  either af ( solved in @xcite ) or purely infinite ( solved in @xcite )  and the early general results obtained by three of the authors ( @xcite,@xcite ) similarly require restrictions on the amount of `` mixing '' , so we predict that the key will be to resolve how such issues influence the general @xmath10-theoretic machinery which we in the unital case may replace with a geometric aproach .",
    "in this section , we introduce notation , concepts and results concerning graphs and their @xmath5-algebras that are needed for stating the main results . most of the definitions are more or less verbatim recalled from @xcite , except for the definition of move and pulelehua equivalence ( @xmath11 ) that are new to this paper , _ cf .",

    "<S> we provide a complete classification of the class of unital graph algebras   prominently containing the full family of cuntz - krieger algebras  showing that morita equivalence in this case is determined by ordered , filtered @xmath0-theory . </S>",
    "<S> the classification result is _ geometric _ in the sense that it establishes that any morita equivalence between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in this class can be realized by a sequence of moves leading from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , in a way resembling the role of reidemeister moves on knots . as a key ingredient </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a new class of such moves , establish that they leave the graph algebras invariant , and prove that after this augmentation , the list of moves becomes complete in the sense described above .    along the way </S>",
    "<S> , we prove that every ordered , reduced filtered @xmath0-theory isomorphism can be lifted to an isomorphism between the stabilized algebras  and , as a consequence , that every ordered , reduced filtered @xmath0-theory isomorphism preserving the class of the unit comes from a isomorphismbetween the unital graph @xmath5-algebras themselves .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the question of morita equivalence amongst unital graph @xmath5-algebras is a decidable one . as immediate examples of applications of our results we revisit the classification problem for quantum lens spaces and verify , in the unital case , the abrams - tomforde conjectures </S>"
