    "( [ ggscloc ] ) and ( [ gadesc ] ) should not be taken as the general result for the molecular decay rate in an absorbing cavity valid for all positions of the molecule away from the cavity walls and for all transition dipole orientations .",
    "similarly , in view of eq .",
    "( [ eg ] ) , it appears that eq .",
    "( [ elocext ] ) indicates a rather general relationship between the green function elements for a system with and without the onsager cavity : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is in the external layer and @xmath3 in the cavity .",

    "of course , as already stressed , these conjectures can not be proved without the calculation of the exact green function for the system including the onsager cavity at the source position .",
    "to illustrate the effect of the local field on the decay rate in absorbing cavities , we exploit the above simple model and consider the decaying molecule in the center of an absorbing dielectric sphere surrounded by air ( @xmath160 ) .",
