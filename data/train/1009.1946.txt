    "the anderson transition@xcite , in which eigenstates of non - interacting electrons are localized by disorder , has long been a paradigm of a metal - insulator transition in solid state physics .",
    "the metallic phase occurs only in three dimensions , since any amount of randomness localizes all particles in one or two dimensions . in three dimensions ,",
    "a mobility edge separates localized states whose energies lie at the edges of the spectrum , from extended states whose energies lie in the middle .",
    "the mobility edges appear for a critical value of the disorder and move with the disorder until no extended states remain .",
    "if the fermi energy is located below or above the mobility edge , inside the localized states , the system is then an insulator .",
    "recently , research on this subject has experienced renewed interest as localization of cold atoms in the presence of a disordered optical potential has been observed @xcite . whereas experiments in solid state physics are intrinsically limited as interactions between electrons can not be neglected ,",
    "cold atoms allow the exploration of the non - interacting regimes with possibilities of control that could not be achieved before .",
    "another , simpler origin for an insulating behavior in a solid is the presence of gaps due to a periodic potential applied to the particles .",
    "these two possible insulating phases are in competition with each other as they are based on opposite behaviors .",
    "the anderson insulator is due to the localized nature of the wave function , whereas the gapped insulator is due to its extended nature .",
    "a third source of insulating behavior is interactions between particles . in many ways",
    "this is the most difficult situation , since it involves treating the many - body problem accurately . in the systems with both interactions and randomness , competition between mott and band insulating phases",
    "have been shown to result in metallic phases , as the two sources of insulating behavior counteract each other @xcite .",
    "the possibility of metallic phases arising due to the addition of interactions to two dimensional disordered systems has also been an area of great interest @xcite .",
    "the goal of this article is to study the interplay between the two sources of single particle insulating behavior- disorder and gaps due to a periodic potential- in the context of non - hermitian matrices . for this we will use a modified version of the hatano - nelson model ( hnm ) , that includes at the same time a periodic potential that generates gaps in the eigenspectrum and a disordered potential that will drive a localization transition .",
    "the hnm @xcite is a single particle , random , non - hermitian hamiltonian that was introduced to study the motion of magnetic flux lines in disordered type ii superconductors , the path integral representation of the hnm being analogous to a classical model used to describe the flux lines .",
    "the hnm shows a localization transition in one dimension@xcite .",
    "it is then a very convenient tool to study the localization transition numerically , as it allows the study of systems with large linear sizes .",

    "the conclusion describes some of the connections the additional term we introduce into the hatano - nelson model has with the eigenspectrum of several physical systems for whose properties random matrices have been used .",

    "the hnm spectrum becomes identical to that of the anderson model . on a system with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , however , this eigenvector transformation is no longer possible , and some eigenvalues are complex ( see fig .",

    "a localized state is insensitive to the boundary conditions and its eigenvalue should remain real , even in the presence of pbc . on the contrary ,",
    "an extended state , for example a plane wave state , is sensitive to the boundary conditions and its eigenvalue should be complex in the pbc case ( fig .",

    "when the hoppings in the two dimensions are comparable , in contrast , the central hole can get filled in .",

    "random non - hermitian matrices also arise in the study of quenched quantum chromo - dynamics at finite quark density.@xcite while the structure of the matrices does not take the precise form of the hnm , it is interesting that in certain cases (  dyson index \" @xmath90 ) a gap appears in the spectrum in the complex plane , analogous to that found here.@xcite that is , the eigenvalue distribution can be driven to zero in a region in the vicinity of the imaginary axis , not unlike the effect of increasing @xmath63 in fig .",

    "( in these studies the spatial dimensionality is greater than one so that the eigenvalues are space filling as opposed to lying along one - dimensional curves . ) indeed , a key result@xcite is that the appearance of a gap around the imaginary axis requires a finite value of the appropriate tuning parameter , the chemical potential @xmath91 , much as our phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) requires a finite staggered potential @xmath92 for the appearance of a gap .    the original motivation for the hnm was the problem of flux line motion in type ii superconductors .",
