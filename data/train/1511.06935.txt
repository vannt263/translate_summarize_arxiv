    "the top - hat spherical collapse ( tsc , hereafter ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is among the most fundamental analytical models that describe the non - linear cosmic structure formation .",
    "tsc , however , assumes a highly idealized system ; a uniform , spherical and isolated object with no velocity dispersion until just before relaxation . in reality , the evolution of an actual object is not spherical nor isolated , and interacts with surrounding matter , but the tsc predictions are widely used in modern precision cosmology , including galaxy cluster scaling relations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , halo identification in numerical simulations , and the press - schechter theory @xcite among others .    in particular , the halo identification combined with the press - schchter theory and tsc predictions provides the basis for determining cosmological parameters with the cluster abundance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent studies ) .",
    "even though the halo abundance itself is computed from n - body simulations @xcite , the definition of halos is indeed strongly motivated by the tsc predictions .",
    "several authors have attempted to improve tsc .",
    "a prime example is the self - similar spherical collapse model in the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe , developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model adopts the radial the density profile of the initial fluctuations , which results in the velocity dispersion developing from the center to the outer region . @xcite",
    "have further derived self - similar solutions with tidal torque .",
    "another way of improvement is to abandon the spherical symmetry .",
    "@xcite formulated the evolution of a tri - axial halo neglecting external tide , and @xcite incorporated the effect of the external tide and the `` virialization '' of halos .",
    "the resulting `` ellipsoidal collapse model '' was applied by @xcite in improving the mass function of halos . just like tsc",
    ", the ellipsoidal collapse model is based on many simplified assumptions concerning the halo evolution , so the validity of the model predictions are tested by several authors using cosmological simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have pointed out the disagreement between the prediction of the ellipsoidal collapse model and simulated halos ; the ellipsoidal collapse model predicts that heavier objects are more spherical while in simulations heavier halos tend to have larger ellipticity @xcite . while the measurements of the ellipticity of galaxy clusters by x - ray @xcite and weak lensing @xcite are consistent with the simulation results , the origin of the discrepancy is not yet clear .",
    "since it is difficult to handle the non - sphericity to model the halo evolution , we now return to tsc , and investigate how the tsc predictions hold when the idealized assumptions are broken .",
    "in fact , the validity of tsc predictions for an _ individual _ halo has not yet been adequately tested despite the fact that tsc is widespread as a _",
    "statistical _ tool in modern cosmology .",
    "if we stack the initial conditions of those halos , the resulting average density profiles are spherically symmetric .",
    "nevertheless the individual halo dynamics does not proceed in a spherically symmetric manner , and the final state should deviate from the tsc prediction .",
    "this trivial statement that the averaging and the dynamics do not commute is so obvious , but has never been examined carefully .    in this paper",
    ", we quantitatively compare the predictions of tsc with the evolution of 100 individual halos extracted from a cosmological n - body simulation , rather than considering their statistical average as has been performed so far .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we summarize the predictions of tsc , which will be confronted in the following sections .",
    "section 3 describes our n - body simulation and how to trace back the simulated halos identified at present to the past .",
    "we there show the velocity dispersion of dark matter plays an important role , and investigate its evolution in the phase space .",
    "the evolution of the simulated halos is compared with tsc in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "the main part of this paper , we examine how the velocity dispersion affects the `` virialization '' process of halos . finally , section 6 summarizes this paper .",
    "this section reviews the basic assumptions and analytical predictions of tsc , for convenience in the following sections .",
    "first we describe the collapse model in the eds universe , and then add the relevant modifications for the cosmological constant .",
    "tsc assumes the following initial density profile : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the cosmic mean density at the initial time @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the initial overdensity to the cosmic mean density . throughout this paper",
    ", we refer to tsc for the uniform density ( @xmath6 const . ) .",
    "thus the total mass @xmath7 of the sphere is @xmath8 .",
    "the time evolution of the outermost radius @xmath9 of the sphere follows @xmath10 which has the cycloidal solution : @xmath11 it is conventional to normalize @xmath12 and @xmath13 by the values at the maximum expansion , or _",
    "turn - around _ time , @xmath14 and turn - around radius @xmath15 , respectively , and they satisfy @xmath16 the solution provides an extremely simplified description ; the radius contracts to exactly zero at the _ collapse time _ @xmath17 .    throughout the evolution ,",
    "the density remains uniform , and the overdensity @xmath18 monotonically increases with time , and is parametrically described as follows : @xmath19 since @xmath13 contracts to zero at @xmath20 , @xmath21 diverges to infinity , which is , of course , unrealistic . instead , the system is usually assumed to instantaneously reach to the virial equilibrium ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the radius of the sphere in this case is derived as follows .    at @xmath23 , the kinetic energy @xmath24 since all the matter inside the sphere",
    "stop expansion ( turn - around ) .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath25 inside the sphere is assumed to be half the absolute value of the potential energy @xmath26 .",
    "since the density in the sphere is uniform at all times , the potential energy @xmath27 within the sphere should be given as @xmath28 hence , by equating the total energies , one obtains @xmath29 note that the factor 3/5 in the potential energy depends in general on the density profile .",
    "it is essential that the retained uniformity of density yields the _ same _ factor of 3/5 both at @xmath14 and @xmath30 .",
    "we will revisit this point in section 5 .",
    "the radius of the sphere _ instantaneously _ takes the finite value , @xmath31 , rather than vanishing , which is still a simplified assumption .",
    "also , the sphere is often assumed to be totally isolated , so the size stays unchanged @xmath31 .",
    "in reality , however , the sphere grows due to the infall of surrounding matter .",
    "the above results indicate that the overdensity @xmath21 at @xmath32 is @xmath33 this value is widely used as the threshold of halo identification in numerical simulations .",
    "note that , this value is independent of the mass @xmath7 and the initial overdensity @xmath34 .",
    "the above results are strictly correct only in the eds universe , and we need to take into account the cosmological constant @xmath35 . even in the universe with @xmath35 , the relation @xmath17 still holds , but both times are later than those of the sphere of the same @xmath34 in the eds universe , due to the existence of @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , the ratio @xmath36 becomes slightly less than 1/2 because the cosmological constant contributes to the total energy in the form of @xmath37 ( the factor 1/10 comes from the uniformity of density ) .",
    "the difference from 1/2 depends on the mean matter density parameter @xmath38 at @xmath39 . along with",
    "the change of @xmath36 , the virial overdensity @xmath40 ( with respect to the cosmic mean density , not to the critical density ) also depends on @xmath38 at @xmath39 . according to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for our simulated universe with @xmath43 , assuming that the sphere collapses exactly at @xmath0 .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath44 to denote the value of 355.4 throughout the rest of this paper , and use the value in identifying halos from the n - body simulation ( section 3.2 ) .    in summary , tsc is based on several simplified assumptions including exact sphericity and uniformity , no velocity dispersion and instantaneous relaxation .",
    "we examine the validity of this highly idealized model by comparing against the evolution of _ individual _ halos in the following sections .",
    "we run a cosmological n - body simulation from @xmath45 to @xmath0 .",
    "we use treepm code gadget-2 @xcite and the initial condition is generated by music code @xcite , which employs second order lagrangian perturbation theory .",
    "the transfer function at the initial redshift @xmath46 is generated by the linear boltzmann code camb @xcite .",
    "we assume the flat @xmath35cdm model with the cosmological parameters consistent with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) 9 year result @xcite : ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51)=(0.279 , 0.721 , 0.7 , 0.972 , 0.821 ) .",
    "we use a periodic box of @xmath52 on a side in comoving scale .",
    "the number of dark matter particles is @xmath53 and the mass of each particle is @xmath54 .",
    "the gravitational softening length is fixed at @xmath55 comoving .    to identify halos in our simulation ,",
    "we follow the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "we set the linking parameter @xmath56 , corresponding to the virial density @xmath57 .",
    "some authors @xcite have pointed out that the overdensity within a fof halo varies with its mass even for the same linking parameter @xmath58 . in our study , however , this issue would not be important since the mass range of the simulated halos is relatively narrow and a `` halo '' is redefined using the spherical overdensity .",
    "we obtain 17535 halos with mass @xmath59 at @xmath0 , and we choose to analyze 100 most massive halos with mass range 2.06 @xmath60 16.6 in order to have a good mass resolution for each halo",
    ". in particular , figures [ dist ] - [ dists ] below utilizes six halos listed in table [ sixhalos ] for illustration .    .",
    "[ sixhalos ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      using the above simulation data , we compare the evolution of each halo with tsc . to this end , we define a sphere that corresponds to a halo identified by the fof algorithm at @xmath0 as follows .",
    "first we calculate the center - of - mass of the fof member particles of a halo . starting from the center - of - mass , we find the radius within which the overdensity becomes @xmath57",
    ". then we calculate the center - of - mass of all the particles in the sphere ( not necessarily the fof member particles ) , and repeat the procedure again .",
    "this process is iterated until the center - of - mass position of the particles in the sphere matches to the center of the sphere within 1 @xmath61 kpc in comoving coordinates .",
    "after the iteration converges , we obtain the mass and radius of that halo , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "for the purpose of our current study , we need the protohalos at different redshifts , which correspond to the halos identified at @xmath0 according to the above procedure .",
    "we have stored fifteen simulation snapshots ; @xmath64 ( initial ) , 49 , 9 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1.5 , 1 , 0.8 , 0.6 , 0.4 , 0.2 , 0.1 and 0 .",
    "we use them to trace back the evolution of halos identified at @xmath0 . for each redshift @xmath65 , we trace the distribution of the fof member particles back to @xmath66 , and calculate the center - of - mass of the distribution at @xmath66 . from the center - of - mass , we find the radius inside which the mass is equal to @xmath62 computed from each halo at @xmath0 .",
    "the iteration process described above is carried out to determine the center of the sphere .",
    "finally , we define @xmath67 as the radius of the sphere .",
    "note that the mass @xmath62 is constant while @xmath67 is a function of redshift .",
    "this procedure mimics the description of tsc .",
    "the left panels of figure [ dist ] plot all the particles within the thickness of 0.03 @xmath68 at each redshift around its center of mass . in order to clarify the degree of mixing of the particles , they are plotted in different colors according to their initial positions ( at @xmath45 ) . by @xmath69 ,",
    "the particles are little mixed , and the particles with the same color roughly keep the shape of the spherical shell . by @xmath70 , however , filament - like structures already started to emerge , indicating that the uniform density assumption begins to break .",
    "the colors of the particles at z=1 , 0.4 and 0 are defined according to their positions at @xmath71 .",
    "the redshift @xmath71 approximately corresponds to the turn - around epoch of halo i. the colors are violently mixed by @xmath72 ( after about 3.5 gyr ) , in contrast to the period from the initial time to @xmath73 ( about 3.3 gyr ) .",
    "this is because the relaxation has finished in the inner part of the halo , and particles in the relaxed region are stirred due to shell - crossing .      in order to see the degree of particle - mixing more clearly",
    ", we consider the phase space as well .",
    "note that , throughout this paper , we refer to the space of radial coordinate and radial velocity ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) as the `` phase space '' , for the comparison with the spherical model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the right panels of figure [ dist ] demonstrate the phase space distribution of particles colored in the same way as the left panels .",
    "the right panels plot a randomly selected one percent of the particles inside the sphere within the shown radial range while the left panels plot all the particles in the slice region .    by definition",
    ", the initial particle distribution looks like seven color bars .",
    "these bars become gradually tilted by @xmath76 . although the coordinate space distribution has exhibited clear non - sphericity by @xmath70 , the phase space distribution looks still well ordered .",
    "the innermost particles , however , have fallen into the center and then have positive ( outward ) radial velocity .",
    "by @xmath73 , the region with large velocity dispersion @xmath77 has formed .",
    "the region gradually expands outward , and finally reaches outside the halo radius @xmath78 .",
    "this is the most remarkable difference between the simulation and the description of tsc .    to look into the region with large @xmath77 more carefully , we fully exploit all the particles and visualize the phase space density in figure [ colcont ] .",
    "the figure clearly shows the high density region around the outer end of the large @xmath77 region , indicating the stream of the particles that have ( more than ) once fallen into the center .",
    "such a motion of particles creates the large @xmath77 region expanding outward .",
    "it is informative to consider here the prediction of the self - similar model for the eds universe @xcite . in the self - similar model",
    ", a spherical shell falls toward the center , and moves outward again after shell - crossing .",
    "the shell turns - around at some radius and falls back toward the center .",
    "such oscillations of a number of shells account for the development of the velocity dispersion in a halo . the physical size of the halo increases with time as more shells infall with larger turn - around radius .",
    "the above picture explains , at least qualitatively , the evolution of @xmath77 of halo i shown in figure [ colcont ] . from @xmath71 to @xmath0 , the velocity dispersion develops from the center of the halo .",
    "the profile of @xmath77 shows a sharp drop - off at the radius corresponding to the end of the large velocity dispersion region .",
    "in contrast , the radial ( peculiar ) velocity @xmath75 almost vanishes in the central region , while it is negative in the outer region , representing the falling particles .",
    "all these features are consistent with the self - similar model .",
    "in addition to the `` regular '' development of @xmath77 described above , the inhomogeneity contributes to the evolution of @xmath77 in the simulated halos . for example",
    ", the infall and the subsequent turn - around of a substructure generates an additional velocity dispersion that is not described in the self - similar model .",
    "such a process enhances individuality of halos , and makes it difficult to find universality ( if any ) of the evolution of @xmath77 , as will be discussed again in later sections .    for the phase space distribution at @xmath0 , the solution of the self - similar model",
    "is overplotted .",
    "the overall feature of the simulated halo is followed , at least qualitatively , by the self - similar solution .",
    "especially , groups of the particles in course of the first and second turning - arounds are apparent in the phase space distribution .",
    "strictly speaking , however , the self similar model describes a _ spherical _ halo in the _ eds universe _ , which naturally leads to the big difference between the simulation data and the overplotted self - similar solution .",
    "in addition , the density profile of the self - similar solution is predicted to be asymptotically proportional to @xmath79 , which is inconsistent with the nfw density profile @xcite .",
    "therefore the self - similar solution is not fully reliable when we _ quantitatively _ investigate the evolution of velocity dispersion .    @xcite",
    "have also considered the region with large velocity dispersion in a different context .",
    "they refer to the radius where the density sharply drops as `` splashback radius '' , which is essentially the same as the locus where the velocity dispersion sharply drops .",
    "they proposed the splashback radius as a more physically motivated definition of a dark halo , instead of the traditional definition by using some threshold overdensity .",
    "although the splashback radius is often much beyond the x - ray observed region of galaxy clusters , @xcite have shown that the relation between the splashback and @xmath80 , within which the overdensity is 200 times the mean matter density , can be written as a function of the peak height inside @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite indicated that the splashback radius may be already observed as a caustic of line - of sight velocity of galaxies by @xcite .",
    "although @xcite claimed that it is difficult to unambiguously determine the splashback radius of individual halos , these studies indicate the importance of velocity dispersion in the halo evolution .",
    "we now compare the evolution of the sphere characterized by the radius @xmath68 defined in section 3.2 , with the prediction of tsc .",
    "figure [ collapse ] demonstrates the results for the six halos in table [ sixhalos ] .",
    "the tsc predictions ( black solid line ) are calculated from the initial overdensity of each halo . from the initial time until shortly before the turn - around epoch @xmath81 , @xmath68 is very close to the model prediction , despite the fact that non - sphericity and non - uniformity develop by @xmath82 . from around @xmath81",
    ", @xmath68 deviates from the model prediction ; the turn - around epoch is delayed , and thereafter the radius of the simulated halo becomes systematically larger than the model .",
    "finally , the radius @xmath68 does not collapse to zero ( naturally ) , but settles into a finite radius .",
    "in addition , the present radius is also larger than the model prediction .",
    "although the degree of the deviation from tsc varies from halo to halo , the above trend holds for majority of the simulated halos : the simulated halos turn around later , and have larger radii both at @xmath81 and @xmath0 than those predicted by tsc .",
    "we suspect that the difference between the simulation and tsc is mostly due to the velocity dispersion focused on in the previous section . in numerical simulations ,",
    "the motion of dark matter particles should be described not by equation ( [ eomtsc ] ) , but by the ( three - dimensional ) jeans equation .",
    "we here focus only on their radial motion to see the effect of the velocity dispersion in the framework of spherical symmetry .",
    "the spherically symmetric version of the jeans equation is @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the lagrangian differentiation , and @xmath85 is the tangential velocity dispersion of dark matter .",
    "note that @xmath85 includes dispersions in two directions ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 directions in the spherical coordinates ) .",
    "the density and velocity dispersion usually decrease as a function of radius , so the first term is expected to delay the collapse epoch .",
    "to confirm this , we evaluate the first two terms at @xmath88 in the right - hand - side of equation ( [ jeans ] ) from the simulation data for each of the fifteen redshifts , and solve the equation ( [ jeans ] ) with the two terms replaced by using the cubic - spline interpolated values from the fifteen redshifts .",
    "the results are illustrated by the dashed lines in figure [ collapse ] .",
    "the prediction based on equation ( [ jeans])reproduces the simulation results much better than that of tsc at least for halos i , ii , iv and v. therefore , we confirm that velocity dispersion explains the delayed turn - around and the stopped contraction . for halos",
    "iii and vi , on the other hand , the modification is not so successful .",
    "this is probably attributed to the strong non - sphericity of the dark matter distribution .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure [ dists ] , halo iii has undergone a drastic merger of two similar mass objects .",
    "halo vi , on the other hand , does not undergo such a big merger , but its mass accretion occurs prominently along a single direction . in the other four halos , matter assembles around the central structure from every direction ( the distribution of halo i is shown in figure [ dist ] ) .",
    "hence , the level of the improvement depends on the sphericity in the evolution of the halos .",
    "also , the velocity dispersion terms in equation ( [ jeans ] ) are not uniquely determined , so the details of the result depend on their evaluated values .",
    "our present purpose , however , is not to precisely improve tsc , but to confirm the effect of velocity dispersion .",
    "thus we conclude that the velocity dispersion plays an important role in the halo evolution from the above comparison .",
    "if we can model the evolution of @xmath77 of an individual halo fully from initial conditions , such a model helps us understand the halo evolution beyond the spherical collapse model .",
    "we have found , however , that the profiles of @xmath77 and density vary sensitively from halo to halo : although we made sure that @xmath77 calculated from the linear power spectrum of the matter density fluctuations can approximate that of simulated halos at the early stage ( @xmath89 ) , the late evolution strongly depends on merger and mass accretion processes of each halo .",
    "also , as stated in section 3.3 , the evolution of @xmath77 in the self - similar model is not quantitatively successful in describing that of the simulated halo .",
    "thus the improved modelling , we do not attempt here , remains as an important future work .    as a preliminary step to the above challenge , therefore",
    ", we evaluate more quantitatively the deviation from tsc . in the next section",
    ", we do so by comparing the radii of the halos at the initial , the turn - around , and the present times .",
    "in this section , we focus on the difference in the present radius @xmath90 between the simulation and tsc prediction .",
    "we first compare @xmath90 and @xmath15 of the simulated halos .",
    "next , we compare @xmath90 of the simulated halos with the predicted value by tsc from the initial conditions . to investigate the origin of the difference , it is essential to factorize the ratio into energy terms , and we here provide relevant definitions for preparation .",
    "the ratio of radii at two epochs may be predicted from the conservation of the total energies @xmath91 at those epochs .",
    "we decompose the total energy @xmath91 into the kinetic energy @xmath92 ( due to both the hubble expansion and the peculiar velocity ) , the gravitational potential energy @xmath27 and the energy @xmath93 due to the cosmological constant .",
    "the potential energies @xmath27 and @xmath93 within the sphere of mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath13 are given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively , where the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 depend on the density profile inside the halo ( see , e.g. , equation [ eqgamnfw ] and discussion therein ) .",
    "even if the particle distribution is non - spherical , the above parametrization is valid as long as a sphere of radius @xmath13 is considered .    in order to derive a radial ratio at two epochs , the kinetic energy @xmath92 must be associated with the other energy terms . in the settings of tsc ,",
    "@xmath98 at @xmath99 , and @xmath100 at @xmath101 , in order to consider the difference from these predictions , we define the parameter @xmath102 as @xmath103 then the total energy @xmath91 can be written as @xmath104    from now on , in order to represent the above quantities at different epochs , we use the subscript @xmath105 to mean either of `` ini '' , `` ta '' , and `` 0 '' , denoting the quantity at @xmath101 , @xmath81 and 0 ( present ) , respectively .    in the following sections , we use the ratio between the radii at @xmath0 and another epoch , assuming that the virial theorem is applicable to the halos at @xmath0 .",
    "by equating the total energies @xmath106 ( @xmath107 `` ta '' or `` ini '' ) and @xmath108 , one obtains the ratio @xmath109 in terms of those coefficients of the energies .",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath109 is a solution of the cubic equation , and the exact expression is not useful in understanding how each energy term contributes the difference between the simulation and tsc .",
    "the contribution of @xmath35 is , however , very small compared to @xmath27 : @xmath110 which is , for example , less than 1 % at @xmath0 ( @xmath111 by definition for our adopted cosmology ) .",
    "hence we can treat @xmath112 as an infinitesimal .",
    "note , however , that , according to the virial theorem in the universe with @xmath35 @xcite , a virialized halo satisfies @xmath113 in the same settings as tsc , i.e. , @xmath114 includes an additional @xmath112 .",
    "hence we define another parameter @xmath114 only for @xmath0 as @xmath115 although the difference between @xmath116 and @xmath114 is negligible at the level of the following discussion .",
    "then the total energy @xmath108 at @xmath0 is @xmath117 @xmath118 . by equating @xmath108 and @xmath119 @xmath120",
    ", we solve @xmath109 perturbatively up to the leading term in @xmath112 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\frac{\\lambda r_x^3}{gm}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a substantial fraction of the particles in a simulated halo defined in section 3.2 indeed move into and out of the sphere between the two epochs , and the total energy within the sphere is not necessarily guaranteed to be conserved .",
    "the parameter @xmath125 indicates the degree of the energy conservation .",
    "we calculate the above parameters @xmath102 , @xmath125 and @xmath96 for the 100 simulated halos . for a simulated halo ,",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath92 is calculated as @xmath126 where @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are mass , position and peculiar velocity of the @xmath130-th particle , and @xmath131 is the hubble parameter at the epoch .",
    "the summation is taken over all the particles within the sphere of radius @xmath13 .",
    "the gravitational potential energy @xmath27 is calculated as @xmath132 where the summation is taken over all the combinations of the @xmath130-th and @xmath133-th particles within the sphere of radius @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath96 is simply computed as @xmath134 .",
    "the tsc prediction ( [ rvtorta ] ) is based on the energy conservation between the turn - around and the collapse epochs . as seen in section 4 , however , it is difficult to define unambiguously its collapse time .",
    "so , we first compare the _ present _ radius @xmath90 with the turn - around radius @xmath15 instead .",
    "if tsc is exact , @xmath90 defined with @xmath57 should correspond to @xmath31 for objects that collapsed at @xmath0 .",
    "note that , both @xmath90 and @xmath15 in this section are of the simulated halos .",
    "the ratio @xmath135 predicted by tsc is 0.483 , which can be compared with the simulation .",
    "the top - left panel of figure [ tato0 ] shows that the @xmath135 of the simulated halos is 0.56 on average , with roughly 10 - 20 percent scatter .",
    "this level of the deviation may be fully expected , given the extremely simplified assumptions of tsc .    in order to identify the origin of the discrepancy more quantitatively",
    ", we use equation ( [ rytorx ] ) . in tsc , @xmath136 , which explains the difference between the values of @xmath135 between the eds universe ( @xmath137 ) and the universe with @xmath35 ( @xmath138 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we do not consider the contribution of each parameter in @xmath139 to @xmath135 , and use the following : @xmath140 note that the contribution of @xmath35 is partly incorporated in @xmath141 .",
    "tsc predicts that the kinetic energy vanishes at @xmath81 ( @xmath142 ) , and the virial theorem states that @xmath143 .",
    "in addition , the density profile is always uniform ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "thus , combined with energy conservation ( @xmath145 ) , one obtains @xmath138 .",
    "the number of our available snapshots of the simulation is limited , so we define the energy terms of each halo at @xmath81 as follows .",
    "first , for a simulated halo , the values of radius at fifteen redshifts are cubic - spline interpolated , and its maximum value and the corresponding epoch are defined as @xmath15 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we calculate the energy terms for the two snapshots bracketing @xmath14 , and define the energy at @xmath14 with the linear - interpolation .",
    "let us consider @xmath141 first .",
    "the top - right panel of figure [ tato0 ] shows the calculated @xmath141 for 100 halos .",
    "the average @xmath146 is 0.96 , so the total energy is conserved to a good approximation .",
    "this is not trivial , since a significant fraction ( @xmath147 % ) of the particles in the sphere is changed .",
    "while we take into account the factor , @xmath141 does not play a major role in equation ( [ r0torta ] ) .",
    "the middle panels in figure [ tato0 ] plot @xmath148 and @xmath114 . while tsc states that @xmath142 , the simulated halos have roughly @xmath149 on average .",
    "this is the largest deviation from tsc , and can be attributed to the velocity dispersion in the central region of halos ; at the turn - around , the halo expansion velocity of the outer shell almost vanishes , but the velocity dispersion of the inner region significantly contributes to the kinetic energy .    at the present time",
    ", @xmath114 is 0.62 on average , which is larger than 1/2 predicted by the virial theorem .",
    "this result can be understood according to @xcite , who study the virialized state of a spherical halo with the nfw density profile .",
    "they defined the virialized state as a solution of the spherical jeans equation , and derived the ratio @xmath150 as a function of radius with the concentration parameter , @xmath151 , and parametrized velocity - anisotropy .",
    "since this model is for the equilibrium state , the halo has no average velocity , but finite velocity dispersion , which yields the substantial kinetic energy . for any concentration parameter and velocity - anisotropy",
    ", they find that @xmath150 is larger than 1/2 at any radius , and increases toward the center .",
    "this is mainly due to the density and velocity dispersion inside the sphere , and the matter surrounding the halo is not important . in most cases , @xmath150 at the virial radius",
    "is in the range from 0.5 to 1 , which is in qualitative agreement with our simulated halos .",
    "the difference in @xmath114 between the simulation and tsc is also attributed to the velocity dispersion that is naturally expected in the inside - out collapse model in the cdm universe .",
    "next , we look at @xmath152 and @xmath153 , which are shown in the bottom panels in figure [ tato0 ] . both are distributed around unity , which is different from 3/5 for the uniform density profile .",
    "as stated before , @xmath96 depends on the density profile inside the sphere .",
    "for example , the single power - law density profile @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) results in @xmath156 .",
    "hence @xmath157 implies @xmath158 .    for the nfw profile with the concentration parameter @xmath151",
    ", we obtain @xmath159\\left[\\log(1+c)-\\frac{c}{1+c}\\right]^{-2 } \\label{eqgamnfw}\\ ] ] at the virial radius .",
    "figure [ gammanfw ] plots equation ( [ eqgamnfw ] ) , showing that @xmath96 is a increasing function of @xmath151 and @xmath160 .",
    "hence , for any @xmath151 , the nfw profile predicts larger values of @xmath96 than 3/5 from the uniform profile . according to @xcite , halos with the mass range @xmath161 ( our sample ) typically have @xmath162 , implying @xmath163 .",
    "the range agrees well with our @xmath153 . at @xmath81 ,",
    "the density profile of the halo is not necessarily described by the nfw profile , so the above discussion can not be applied .",
    "the difference between @xmath152 and @xmath153 is small , so they do not play a major role .",
    "also , as long as @xmath135 is concerned , the deviation of @xmath96 from 3/5 itself is not important , but difference at the two epochs contributes the budget .    in summary ,",
    "the ratio @xmath164 is increased by @xmath165 ( not 1 ) , and decreased by @xmath166 relative to the tsc prediction , which finally yields 0.58 , approximately explaining the mean value of 0.56 .",
    "this implies that , although the non - zero velocity dispersion effect is fairly large , the other effects tend to cancel it in practice .",
    "an important advantage of tsc is its definite prediction for evolution of a halo _ from the initial condition _ and also the insensitivity of the result to @xmath7 .",
    "hence , we now compare the tsc prediction of the halo radius @xmath168 at @xmath0 from the initial condition ( @xmath45 ) measured for the simulation , against the radius @xmath169 measured for simulated halos @xmath0 . from now , we distinguish the two by denoting `` tsc '' or `` sim '' .",
    "the upper - left panel of figure [ inito0 ] plots the ratio @xmath170 for the 100 simulated halos . for most halos , @xmath170 is greater than unity .",
    "we suspect that the velocity dispersion produces this trend , and investigate its effect in the following .",
    "we again use the spherical collapse model to describe @xmath168 for simplicity . in the linear regime ( @xmath171 ) , equations ( [ roftheta ] ) and ( [ deltaoftheta ] ) are approximated as @xmath172 and @xmath173 . combined with @xmath174 , the model prediction for the present radius is given by @xmath175 ( here we have derived the above expression based on tsc in the eds universe , but it holds in the flat universe up to the first order of @xmath112 . ) using the ratio @xmath176 that can be written in the form of equation ( [ rytorx ] ) ; we obtain @xmath177 where @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 are defined at @xmath101 as we did at @xmath99 ( section 5.1 ) . since @xmath167 is very small , we neglect the correction due to @xmath181 .",
    "we calculate @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 from the simulation data .",
    "we again begin with looking at the energy conservation .",
    "we find that the particles within a halo change by about 30 % from @xmath101 to @xmath0 . as a result",
    ", the upper - right panel of figure [ inito0 ] shows that the total energy within the sphere changes within by @xmath1 7 % from @xmath101 to @xmath0    at the initial time , the density is almost uniform , so @xmath182 , and @xmath183 for small @xmath184 .",
    "actually , the simulated halos have the values of @xmath180 and @xmath178 very close to the theoretical values , as shown in the lower panels of figure [ inito0 ] . thus equation ( [ r0s ] )",
    "practically reduces to @xmath185 which indicates that the deviation of @xmath170 from unity is largely dictated by @xmath114 and @xmath153 .",
    "if @xmath143 and @xmath186 , @xmath187 .",
    "in reality , however , @xmath188 0.76 reduces @xmath170 , and @xmath189 increases @xmath170 to 1.3 , which approximates the average @xmath190 1.2 .",
    "therefore , the deviation @xmath170 is mainly attributed to the non - uniformity of the _ present _ density profile and the _ present _ kinetic energy due to the velocity dispersion .",
    "it is interesting to see how the above results depend on the initial overdensity @xmath34 of the simulated halos since the tsc predictions are almost independent of the halo mass and mainly determined by @xmath34 .",
    "we have defined the spherical region for each halo based on the overdensity @xmath44 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 corresponds to a halo that is predicted to collapse exactly at @xmath191 by tsc .",
    "figure 3 shows , however , the simulated haloes collapse significantly earlier ( although it is difficult to precisely determine when they collapse , since the radius does not shrink to zero ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath34 of the simulated halos is larger than predicted by tsc .",
    "in fact , the upper panel of figure 8 shows that all the simulated halos have the initial overdensity ( normalized by the linear growth factor ) larger than the linearly extrapolated threshold of @xmath192 = 1.67 for a halo that is expected to collapse at present in tsc .",
    "in addition , there seems a weak trend that mass is anti - correlated to @xmath34 ; more massive halos have smaller @xmath34 . although the statistical significance is not strong , this is consistent with the initial density distribution of random - gaussian field first derived by doroshkevich ( 1970 ) .    because of the above correlation of mass and @xmath34 , we attempt to replot @xmath170 and @xmath135 now in terms of @xmath34 . here",
    "we recall that we have defined the sphere for each present halo based on the common @xmath44 .",
    "so , by definition , @xmath170 is proportional to @xmath193 ( cf . equation ( [ r0s ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , the lower - left panel of figure [ delini ] shows that @xmath170 follows a single curve as expected .    similarly to @xmath170 , @xmath135 should follow a single curve if tsc were an exact description of the evolution of simulated halos . in reality",
    ", however , their relation has a relatively larger scatter around the mean relation as shown in the lower - right panel of figure [ delini ] .",
    "this corresponds to the deviation from the tsc prediction at @xmath99 . while the degree of the scatter may be related to the non - sphericity of each simulated halo , we were not able to identify a clear dependence of non - sphericity on @xmath34 .",
    "we also confirmed that there is no clear dependence on @xmath34 in the parameters such as @xmath148 , @xmath152 , etc .",
    "a further study on non - sphericity of halos may need a precise non - spherical definition of the region of simulated halos , and a wider mass range of halos , which we plan to study and present elsewhere .",
    "we have quantitatively tested the limitations and reliability of the predictions of the top - hat spherical collapse model ( tsc ) .",
    "our halo - to - halo comparison of the spherically - averaged dynamics of 100 halos identified from a cosmological n - body simualtion yields the following results .    1 .",
    "even though the averaging and the dynamics do not commute , the overall predictions of tsc approximately describe the evolution of the simulated halos fairly well , in particular prior to their turn - around epochs . in reality , however , the non - uniformity / inhomogeneity of dark matter density profiles and the non - zero velocity dispersions , both of which are neglected in tsc , turn out to play an important dynamical role .",
    "2 .   unlike a simplified tsc picture of the instantaneous collapse , dense clumps inside a halo collapse first , and",
    "merge and fall into the central region .",
    "thus a large velocity dispersion is developed from the center to outer parts .",
    "the region with the velocity dispersion expands outward , and finally reaches outside the `` virialized '' region predicted by tsc .",
    "the velocity dispersion inside the halos strongly affects the size of the present _ virial _ radius of halos . at the turn - around epoch @xmath81 ,",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath92 amounts to 37 % of the gravitational potential energy @xmath27 , which increases the ratio @xmath135 of the radii of the simulated halos at @xmath0 and @xmath99 by @xmath1 58 % .",
    "the velocity dispersion also contributes to the kinetic energy , and @xmath150 becomes 0.62 on average ( larger than 0.5 in tsc ) , which decreases @xmath135 by 25 % . in total , @xmath135 is 0.56 on average , which is larger than the tsc prediction ( @xmath194 0.483 ) by 16 % .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath170 of the present radius of the simulated halos to the tsc prediction significantly deviates from unity ; @xmath170 is 1.2 on average .",
    "the deviation from the tsc prediction is explained on average by @xmath1 20 % decrease due to the non - zero velocity dispersion effect , and @xmath1 60 % increase due to the non - uniformity of dark matter density profile at @xmath0 .",
    "while the two effects tend to cancel each other , those two effects need to be properly taken into account in the dynamical description of evolution of actual individual halos in the cdm universe",
    ".    the interpretation of the present results may slightly vary .",
    "it could be concluded that despite the idealized assumptions , the overall tsc predictions are largely reliable within 20 % . on the contrary , however , we could argue that the tsc predictions should be critically re - examined given their wide applications in the modern precision cosmology .    in the latter spirit ,",
    "the velocity dispersion , which is usually neglected in the standard tsc , needs to be discussed and modelled . especially , its characteristic evolution in the phase space may provide a more physically reasonable definition of dark halos @xcite , instead of the conventional definition on the basis of the overdensity threshold motivated by tsc .",
    "as we have shown , the size of the simulated halos differs from the tsc predictions by @xmath1 20 % , which suggests that the conventional value of the threshold overdensity @xmath57 should be revised accordingly . for this value of @xmath21 , in tsc",
    ", halos are supposed to collapses exactly at @xmath0 . as seen in figure [ collapse ] , however , the predicted collapse time ( black solid line ) is significantly earlier than the present time , meaning that the mapping of the overdensity from the initial time to the present time is different from the press - schechter description .",
    "while @xcite succeeded in modifying the halo abundance by incorporating the halo ellipticity , the above result may also lead some modification of the halo abundance in the framework of the spherical symmetry .",
    "our halo identification in the present paper still adopts this value , and further discussion of this modification is beyond the current analysis ; the quantitative implications have to be considered using a sort of iterative approaches of the comparison with different sets of halos identified by varying the values of @xmath44 , which is very expensive and time - consuming .",
    "we plan to perform the analysis along this line and to present the results elsewhere .    to carry the above discussion further , a model to describe the halo evolution more accurately than tsc will be helpful . in other words ,",
    "the modelling of @xmath77 is needed .",
    "this is a challenging task since the evolution of @xmath77 is sensitive to the evolution of individual halos including merger processes . indeed",
    "the velocity dispersion effect may explain the possible discrepancy between the ellipsoidal collapse model and the simulations / observations as mentioned in introduction ; heavier halos are more spherical in theoretical models @xcite , while simulations and observations have drawn the opposite conclusion @xcite .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is often attributed to the merger process .",
    "since the evolution of @xmath77 is strongly related to the merger process of individual halos , the further consideration of the evolution of @xmath77 may elucidate the origin of the problem .",
    "our current analysis suggests that the velocity dispersion of dark halos may be a key to improve the simplified tsc picture .",
    "this is not only a theoretically motivated problem , but would have a big impact on the cosmology with galaxy clusters in particular .",
    "we hope that our result detailed here will act as a first step towards a model construction to improve the simple , but widely used , tsc predictions .",
