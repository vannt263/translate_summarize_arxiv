    "the @xmath3 meson is distinguished from other vector mesons , since it contains mainly strange quarks .",
    "because of its dominant strange quark content , its decays to lighter mesons and coupling to the nucleon are known to be suppressed by the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule . in fact , the strange vector form factors of the nucleon , which is implicitly related to the @xmath0 meson via the vector - meson dominance , is reported to be rather small  @xcite .",
    "this large @xmath4 content of the @xmath0 meson makes the meson - exchange picture unfavorable in describing photoproduction of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "thus , the pomeron  @xcite is believed to be the main contribution to @xmath0 photoproduction , since it explains the slow rise of the differential cross sections of @xmath0 photoproduction as the energy increases . however , while it is true in the higher energy region , a recent measurement reported by the leps collaboration  @xcite shows a bump - like structure around the photon energy @xmath5 gev .",
    "it seems that the pomeron alone can not account for this bump - like structure and requires that one should consider other production mechanism of @xmath0 photoproduction near the threshold energy .",
    "moreover , a recent measurement of the spin - density matrix elements near the threshold region  @xcite implies that hadronic degrees of freedom play essential role in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "so far , the theoretical understanding of the production mechanism for the @xmath0 photoproduction can be summarized as follows :    * general energy - dependence of the cross sections is mainly explained by pomeron exchange that can be taken as either a scalar meson or a vector meson with charge conjugation @xmath6 . while the pomeron explains the increase of the differential cross section @xmath7 in the forward direction , it can not describe the behavior of @xmath7 near the threshold . *",
    "the exchange of neutral pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) provides a certain contribution to @xmath7 near the threshold but it is not enough to explain the threshold behavior of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 and @xmath9 exchanges wrongly predict the spin - density observables and , in particular , @xmath10 matrix element ( see appendix for its definition ) . *",
    "usual vector meson - exchanges such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 are forbidden due to their negative charge conjugations ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "otherwise , the charge conjugation symmetry will be broken . *",
    "vector meson - exchanges with exotic quantum number such as @xmath14 are allowed but those vector mesons are not much known experimentally . moreover , as for the experimental data from the deuteron target , exchange of isoscalar mesons is more plausible . on the other hand , there is no experimental evidence for isoscalar hybrid - exotic mesons  @xcite . *",
    "the contribution of scalar mesons such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 are negligibly small for @xmath7  @xcite .    understanding this present theoretical and experimental situation in @xmath0 photoproduction , ozaki et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a coupled - channel effects based on the @xmath17-matrix formalism .",
    "they considered the @xmath18 and @xmath19 kernels  @xcite in the coupled - channel formalism in addition to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is a very plausible idea , since the threshold energy for the @xmath22 is quite close to that for the bump - like structure ( @xmath23 gev ) , the @xmath24 resonance may influence @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "moreover , the @xmath25 reaction can be regarded as a subreaction for the @xmath26 process together with the @xmath27 one in ref .",
    "in addition , a possible nucleon resonance ( @xmath28 ) with large @xmath4 content was also taken into account .",
    "interestingly , the coupled - channel effects were shown to be not enough to explain the bump - like structure @xmath29 gev .",
    "on the other hand , the bump - like structure was described by their possible @xmath30 resonance and was interpreted as a destructive interference arising from the @xmath30 resonance  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we want to scrutinize in detail the nontrivial hadronic contributions arising from hadronic box diagrams in addition to pomeron and pseudoscalar meson exchanges .",
    "extending the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider seven possible box diagrams with intermdiate @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath2 states .",
    "however , it is quite complicated to compute these box diagrams explicitly , so that we use the landau - cutkosky rule  @xcite , which yields the imaginary part of the box diagrams by its discontinuity across the branch cut . though their real part may contribute to the transition amplitude",
    ", we will show that the imaginary part already illuminates the coupled - channel effects on the production mechanism of @xmath37 near the threshold .",
    "the parameters such as the coupling constants and cut - off masses of the form factors will be fixed by describing the corresponding processes and by using experimental and empirical data . yet",
    "unknown parameters are varied as compared to the present experimental data .",
    "in addition , we tune the strength of the pomeron amplitude near the threshold region , where the hadronic contribution seems more significant .",
    "it is a legitimate procedure , since the pomeron gets more important as the energy increases .",
    "thus , we determine the threshold parameter in such a way that the pomeron exchange becomes effective in the higher energy region .",
    "we did not consider any @xmath30 resonance , since we do not have much information on them above the @xmath38 threshold  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the coupled - channel effects are indeed essential in explaining the recent leps data , which is the different conclusion from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we explain the basic formalism .",
    "we show how to compute the box diagrams mentioned above . in section iii",
    ", we present the numerical results such as the energy dependence of the forward cross sections , the angular distributions , and the spin observables .",
    "we also discuss how the @xmath39 channel can explain the bump - like structure together with the pomeron exchange tuned .",
    "we discuss in detail the spin - density matrix elements for @xmath0-photoproduction .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and outlook . in the appendix ,",
    "we present the definition of the spin - density matrix elements for reference .",

    "the amplitude of the pomeron - exchange  @xcite is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the polarization vectors of the @xmath0 meson and photon .",
    "@xmath58 is @xmath59 where the transition operator @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "note that the pomeron amplitude preserves gauge invariance @xmath63 .",

    "@xmath68 is the isoscalar form factor of the nucleon , whereas @xmath69 is the form factor for the photon-@xmath0 meson - pomeron vertex .",
    "they are parameterized , respectively , as @xmath70 the pomeron trajectory @xmath71 in eq.([eq:4 ] ) is determined from hadron elastic scattering in the high - energy region .",
    "the prefactor @xmath72 in eq.([eq:4 ] ) governs the overall strength of the amplitude and @xmath73 determines the starting energy at which the pomeron - exchange comes into play .",
    "we will discuss the determination of these two parameters in section  [ sec:3 ] .      to calculate pseudoscalar meson @xmath75 exchange in the @xmath76 channel , we introduce the following effective lagrangians : @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath42 denote the @xmath0 vector meson , photon , and nucleon fields , respectively . @xmath80 and @xmath81 stand for the @xmath0 meson and nucleon masses respectively .",

    "the cutoff masses are taken to be @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    ". though these values are somewhat different from the phenomenological nucleon - nucleon potentials  @xcite , the effects of the pseudoscalar meson - exchanges on @xmath0 photoproduction are rather small .",
    "thus , we will take the values given above typically used in @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "those of the coupling constants for the @xmath94 vertices are determined by using the radiative decays of the @xmath0 meson to @xmath74 and @xmath9 . using the data from the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , one can find @xmath95 amd @xmath96 .",
    "the negative signs of these coupling constants were determined by the phase conventions in su(3 ) symmetry as well as by @xmath74 photoproduction  @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig:12 ] illustrates the various spin - density matrix elements , compared with the leps data .",

    "other box diagrams also provided certain effects on the part of the spin - density matrix elements .",
    "we have considered in this work only the imaginary part of the transition amplitudes of the box diagrams based on the landau - cutkosky rule .",
