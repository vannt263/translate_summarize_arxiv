    "after the discovery of extraordinary optical transmission ( eot ) through @xmath1d metallo - dielectric gratings , a number of efforts , both numerical and semi - analytical , has been undertaken to understand the physics behind this exceptional phenomenon @xcite .",
    "numerical approaches of modeling eot devices include the transfer matrix formalism @xcite , the finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method @xcite , the rigorous coupled wave analysis ( rcwa ) @xcite , and the exact modal analysis ( ema ) @xcite .",
    "both the transfer matrix and fdtd methods solve maxwell s equations directly using grids and produce accurate results .",
    "other features of these two methods include the ability of visualizing electric and magnetic fields in a plane , both inside and outside of a structure understudy .",
    "further , flow of energy ( poynting vector ) at any location at a particular instant of time can also be calculated and monitored .",
    "however , the transfer matrix formalism and the fdtd method are computationally very demanding @xcite . in contrast , the rcwa and the ema are the two closely related numerical techniques which are widely used to analyze @xmath1d structures @xcite .",
    "the rcwa expresses the dielectric function of the overall grating structure and the electromagnetic ( em ) field inside the grating region ( @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1_chap4 ] ) in terms of fourier series @xcite . with the help of maxwell s equations a space harmonic of the em field can be expressed as a function of the remaining harmonics of the em field and harmonics of the dielectric function . after applying proper boundary conditions at @xmath5 and @xmath6 interfaces , reflection and transmission efficiencies of various diffraction orders",
    "can be calculated @xcite . in the case of ema ,",
    "electromagnetic fields inside the grating region are expressed as waveguide modes .",
    "profiles and wave numbers of various modes are determined numerically by solving a transcendental equation obtained using the stratified medium theory @xcite .",
    "once profiles and wave numbers of different modes are available , maxwell s equations in combination with boundary conditions ( those like the rcwa ) are solved to find reflection and transmission coefficients . at this point",
    "it is relevant to mention that although the numerical techniques discussed here produce good results , they are devoid of physical insights . specifically , relationships among transmission and reflection coefficients , and @xmath7 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 are not clearly understood .",
    "further , simulation techniques discussed above require significant computational power .    to avoid numerical simulation , different simplified models of light transmission and reflection through @xmath1d gratings under sub - wavelength ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dielectric constant of the slits ) condition have been developed @xcite . in developing these models , the fundamental waveguide mode is the only propagating mode inside the slit / cavity is assumed .",
    "in addition , these models also assume that the grating ridge and/or the slit walls are made of perfect electrical conductor ( pec ) @xcite . for most of the metals",
    "the pec assumption holds true in the deep infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and that is where the previous models produce reliable results . in the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum ,",
    "metals become significantly lossy @xcite and the pec assumption along with the existing transmission and reflection models of light fail . in this context , a model which does not assume the pec assumption is necessary to analyze @xmath1d grating structure in the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "further , a model of @xmath1d metallo - dielectric gratings which can provide explanation of light transmission and reflection in terms of grating geometrical parameters is also relevant considering the limitations of the existing models . in this article , we aim to develop a model of @xmath1d metallo - dielectric gratings of real metals which complements the shortcomings of the current semi - analytical ( involves infinite sums ) models . in developing this model , @xmath11 is assumed .",

    "the dielectric constants of the slits and ridges can be written as @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspondingly . a part of the incident energy is reflected back to the incident medium as diffraction orders whereas another part emerges as transmitted diffraction orders in the substrate ( @xmath21 ) of refractive index @xmath22 .",

    "these grating geometrical parameters are supposed to produce a transmission peak at around @xmath122 nm .",

    "corresponding to these parameters , a wood - rayleigh anomaly and a fp resonance should occur at @xmath122 nm . fig .",

    "it can be observed that , like the rcwa , the simple analytical model developed in this article , despite some amplitude mismatch , can predict the wavelength and the profile of the resonance while the model of ref .",
    "@xcite completely fails . according to us",
    "the main reason behind the failure of lalanne and co - workers model of @xmath1d grating is the pec assumption that they have made in deriving their model . as mentioned earlier , the pec assumption is valid deep inside the infrared and the microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and that is where this model matches very well with the rcwa results ( such as those of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum ,",
    "the perfect electrical conductor assumption is invalid for metals like gold , silver and copper .",
    "consequently , results produced using the model of lalanne et al . are inaccurate .",
    "lastly , it is noticeable from fig .",
    "[ fig5_chap4 ] that the line - width of the peak of the analytical model developed here is broader than that obtained from the rcwa .",
    "such a broader peak is normally a characteristic of the fp resonance .",
    "since the model developed here is insensitive to the wood - rayleigh anomaly , the effects of the wra is not reflected in the spectrum obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq15_chap4 ] ) .",
    "consequently , a mismatch between the result generated using the rcwa , that includes the influences of both wra and fp mechanisms , and the data available from eq .",
    "( [ eq15_chap4 ] ) is expected .",
    "in conclusions , an analytical model of light transmission and reflection through @xmath1d metallo - dielectric gratings based upon the exact modal analysis has been developed .",
    "this model can accurately predict a transmission peak due to the fabry - perot resonance .",
    "it has also been theoretically proved that transmission intensity of a peak related to the fabry - perot resonance decreases with the increasing grating thickness and the refractive index of the ridge material .",
    "further , when the grating period is much smaller compared to the incident wavelength , the model presented in this article can capture the variation of transmission intensities as the incident angle changes .",
    "limitation of this model is that it can not stipulate a transmission peak due to the wood - rayleigh anomaly ."
