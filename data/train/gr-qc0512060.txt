    "another differences in my code and makita _ et al .",
    "_ ( 2000 ) is that we use inflow boundary condition that is allow to gas fall into black hole but they use freezing boundary .",
    "the using different boundary close to black hole also makes big difference in the structure of spiral shock waves .    in order to understand the how spiral arms behave after companion star is removed , the injecting gas from outher boundary is stooped .",
    "after the injecting is not allowed any more at @xmath99 , fig.[gamma=1.2_3 ] displays numerical result at @xmath100 that two - armed spiral shock waves are still kept because of tidal forces between companion star and black hole .",
    "mass of the accretion during the whole process is given at fig.[gamma=1.2_6 ] .",

    "the spiral shock waves on an accretion disk are an important mechanism to transform the angular momentum . in this simulation",
    "it is concluded that accretion disk is rotating with sub - keplerian velocity , which is carrying positive angular momentum , and spiral shock waves moving much slower than the disk and they are carrying the negative angular momentum .",
    "when the disk material hits to spiral wave , the angular momentum of accretion disk is transform to out of accretion disk .",
    "the shock waves around the black hole are a mechanism of transforming gravitational energy to radiation energy which is observed by the different @xmath101ray observatory satellite , such as chandra .",
    "spiral arms in an accretion disk are one of the mechanism to emit @xmath101ray .",

    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) .",
    "we have also watched behavior of accretion disk after companion star stop injection .",
    "the two - armed spiral structure kept during the evolution .",
    "it concludes that the spiral shocks are formed by tidal forces , not by the inflow , of which claim was posed by bisikalo _",

    ", it is concluded that spiral arms are more tightly in smaller @xmath5 cases than larger ones .",
    "lower @xmath5 means cooler disk with larger mach number of the flow .",
    "our results are comparable with those of makita _",

    "<S> the @xmath0 time dependent solution of thin accretion disk in a close binary system have been presented on the equatorial plane around the schwarzschild black hole . to do that , </S>",
    "<S> the special part of the general relativistic hydrodynamical(grh ) equations are solved using high resolution shock capturing ( hrsc ) schemes . </S>",
    "<S> the spiral shock waves on the accretion disk are modeled using perfect fluid equation of state with adiabatic indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the spiral shock waves are created for gammas except the case @xmath3 . these results consistent with results from newtonian hydrodynamic code except close to black hole . </S>",
    "<S> newtonian approximation does not give good solution while matter closes to black hole . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations illustrate that the spiral shock waves are created close to black hole and the location of inner radius of spiral shock wave is around @xmath4 and it depends on the specific heat rates . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the smaller @xmath5 is the more tightly the spiral winds . </S>"
