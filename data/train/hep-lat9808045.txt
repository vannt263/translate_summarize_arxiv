    "efficient studies of the qcd glueball spectrum are made possible on coarse spatial lattices , provided the temporal discretisation is finer .",
    "this permits sufficient measurements of the glueball correlator before statistical fluctuations dominate @xcite .",
    "these studies found good scaling for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 glueballs .",
    "however for the lightest , scalar state , the mass ( in units of @xmath2 ) was seen to fall rapidly to a minimum when the spatial lattice spacing is @xmath3 fm , where the scaling violations are @xmath4 and then rise as the lattice spacing is increased further ; the `` scalar dip '' .",
    "this effect was also seen in @xmath5 simulations @xcite , although the dip is less pronounced .",
    "the first question is whether symanzik improvement of the action has worked .",
    "[ fig : scaling_1 ] shows the scaling of the scalar from both wilson and improved simulations . in this figure ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath6-irrep tensor glueball is used to set the scale as these mass ratios are independent of any anisotropy renormalisations .",
    "the two curves are results of fitting the datasets to a parabola . fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_1 ] demonstrates the improvement reduces the depth of the dip , but only by about a third .",
    "we are examining a number of other explanations for this behaviour ; the first is that using the plaquette definition for the mean - link parameters leads to an under - estimate of the effects of the tadpole graphs .",
    "secondly , the influence of a critical end - point in a higher - dimensional space of couplings may be at fault .    in our preliminary study of the mean - link definition",
    "no significant improvement is observed .",
    "this is in contrast to findings for @xmath5 where the weaker scalar dip was reduced further by employing the landau - link definition @xcite .",
    "simulations of qcd in the fundamental - adjoint space of plaquette couplings demonstrate the existence of a critical point close to the fundamental axis . as this point",
    "is approached , the mass of the scalar ( in units of the string tension ) has been shown to fall rapidly @xcite . at the critical point ,",
    "at least one lattice correlation length must diverge and this is seen to be the scalar channel .",
    "if this effect is responsible , addition of negatively coupled adjoint terms to the action might define a scaling trajectory where the influence of this critical point is diminished @xcite .",
    "this solution ought to be independent of any symanzik - improvement programme . to test this ,",
    "we have added adjoint - like terms to the anisotropic wilson action .",
    "this report discusses progress with these studies .",
    "simulations of symanzik - improved actions with these new terms are in progress .",
    "based on the observation of the nearby critical point , we consider one member of a class of new actions which include `` adjoint - like '' terms .",
    "the term we add is designed to be easy to simulate with existing update methods .    beginning with the plaquette operator , @xmath7 the wilson discretisations of the magnetic and electric field strengths are @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , where @xmath10 are spatial indices and @xmath11 is the tree - level anisotropy , @xmath12 .",
    "we introduce a term which correlates pairs of spatial plaquettes separated by one site temporally @xmath13 a similar term with spatially correlated plaquette pairs can be constructed but is not considered here .    the separation of the two plaquettes allows the standard cabibbo - marinari and over - relaxation gauge - field update methods to be applied .",
    "including two - plaquette terms adds a computational overhead of just @xmath14 to our anisotropic wilson action workstation codes .",
    "it can be shown that the operator combination @xmath15 has an identical expansion in powers of @xmath16 to @xmath17 up to @xmath18 .",
    "thus a signal for being closer to the qcd fixed point would be physical ratios becoming weakly dependent on the free parameter , @xmath19 .",
    "a candidate action ( without symanzik improvement ) is then @xmath20 mean - link improvement is applied in the standard manner .",
    "we have performed a range of simulations at a number of values of @xmath19 and lattice spacings .",
    "[ fig : omega ] shows the dependence of ratios of glueball masses on @xmath19 at fixed @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) for @xmath23 .",
    "close to @xmath24 ( anisotropic wilson ) , these scaling ratios show a strong dependence on @xmath19 , both in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels . in the range @xmath25",
    "to 3 , the dependence is much weaker for all three channels , and the ratios are closer to their continuum values .",
    "the lattice spacing does not change significantly over this range of @xmath19 ; the lattice mass of the @xmath6 irrep varies by just @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig : scaling_2 ] compares the scaling properties of @xmath23 for two values of @xmath19 to the anisotropic wilson action .",
    "the cut - off dependence in the scalar channel is seen to be reduced significantly .",
    "more data are required to resolve the continuum limit fully .",
    "[ fig : scaling_3 ] shows the tensor irrep rotational symmetry violations and the scaling of the pseudoscalar glueball .",
    "remarkably , the large scaling violations of the wilson action in these channels are seen almost to vanish for @xmath23 with @xmath25 or 2 .",
    "this was not anticipated from critical point arguments .",
    "by comparing data from anisotropic wilson simulations to their symanzik - improved counterparts , we have shown that improvement reduces the scaling violations of the scalar glueball , however large effects remain .",
    "we found that adding to the action a new term which includes the product of two plaquette traces leads to significant reduction in the curious finite - lattice - spacing effects seen for the scalar glueball mass .",
    "surprisingly , the pseudoscalar and @xmath27 tensor irrep masses ( in units of the e - irrep mass ) also show far less cut - off dependence .",
    "we emphasise that the action , @xmath23 used here is not symanzik improved , and has leading discretisation errors at @xmath28 .",
