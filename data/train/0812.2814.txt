    "in hierarchical galaxy formation , galaxy clusters grow through gravitational attraction of matter around high @xmath5 peaks , and they are predicted to be rare at high redshift .",
    "therefore , constraining the number density of high - redshift clusters is an important method of testing hierarchical models ( evrard et al .",
    "2002 ; mantz et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "many previous studies have been carried out to search for evolved structures at high redshift .",
    "radio galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are considered to be signposts for high - redshift proto - clusters , and several studies have found proto - clusters at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "overdense regions are also identified out to @xmath14 using galaxies selected with the lyman break technique or narrowband imaging ( e.g , ouchi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "when identifying overdense regions , it is necessary to compare the overdensity with a control field which lacks notable high - redshift overdense regions .",
    "for such a purpose , many studies have used the @xmath1 deep field south ( cdf - s ) due to the wealth of the deep multiwavelength data over a moderately large field of view @xcite . however , a matter of concern is whether the cdf - s can really be considered as a field devoid of high - redshift overdense regions .",
    "there exist a fair number of high - redshift x - ray - detected agns in the cdf - s , which may harbor high - redshift clusters .    motivated by this , we searched for signs of overdensity around two agns at @xmath3 and @xmath15 separated by @xmath16 in the cdf - s , and we report the discovery of possible overdense regions at @xmath17 @xmath18 in the cdf - s .    throughout this letter , we assume a cosmology with nonzero cosmological constant ( i m et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , consistent with the @xmath22 cosmology @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we used two galaxy samples to identify overdense areas at @xmath233.6 - 3.7 ; a @xmath2-selected sample , and galaxies selected with photometric redshifts .",
    "the lyman break technique has proved to be an efficient method to select galaxies at high redshift from multicolor optical data ( steidel et al . 1996 ) .",
    "for example , giavalisco et al .",
    "( 2004b ) selected b - band dropouts at @xmath24 from goods data . however , since the @xmath25-dropout selection contains galaxies over a broad redshift range , we defined a color space optimized to select galaxies at @xmath263.6 - 3.7 using available spectroscopic redshifts including 17 at @xmath263.6 - 3.7 ( vanzella et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ; popesso et al .",
    "figure 1 shows our selection box , overlaid on galaxies in the cdf - s field .",
    "the figure demonstrates that our selection criteria effectively filter out objects at @xmath27 , and at @xmath28 .",
    "for example , there are 18 galaxies at @xmath29 , but only one of them makes it into the @xmath2-selected sample . for the photometric data",
    ", we used the version r1.1 advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) multiband catalog of the goods team ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004a ) , and the magnitude cut of @xmath30 mag was chosen .    with this method , we selected 245 objects over the cdf - s area of @xmath9160 arcmin@xmath31 corresponding to a surface density of @xmath32 arcmin@xmath33 ( poisson noise ) .      the @xmath2 selection is biased for uv - bright galaxies . as a complementary sample , we also selected @xmath34-band - limited ( @xmath35 mag ) , @xmath173.6 - 3.7 galaxy candidates using photometric redshift .",
    "we estimated the photometric redshifts of the @xmath36-band - limited objects using the bayesian photometric redshift estimation ( bpz ; bentez 2000 ) .",
    "the photometric data include + @xmath37@xmath38 bands , and @xmath39 irac photometry ( giavalisco et al .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) photometry was performed using the version 2.0 released images in the @xmath40- , @xmath41- , and @xmath42-bands of the eso - goods team ( j. retzlaff et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "the depth of the vlt / isaac data reaches @xmath43 at the 5@xmath5 ab limits , and the simultaneous coverage in @xmath44 bands is 160 arcmin@xmath31 after trimming the edges . to create a catalog",
    ", we ran sextractor ( bertin @xmath45 arnouts 1996 ) in double - image mode , using @xmath42-band detections as a reference , and performing photometry in the @xmath40- and @xmath41-bands at the @xmath42 positions .",
    "auto - magnitudes were taken for the @xmath40,@xmath41 , and @xmath42 photometry .",
    "the irac photometry catalog was kindly provided by r. chary ( 2008 , private communication ) . in most cases , we found irac detections for the @xmath34-band selected objects .    to derive photometric redshifts , we used 742 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates with a single burst , or a constant star - formation rate ( sfr ) , or an exponentially declining sfr in the form of sfr @xmath46 exp(t/@xmath47 ) for @xmath47 = 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 15 , or 30gyr .",
    "these template seds were generated using a stellar population synthesis model of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "the metallicity was varied to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 , or @xmath50 , and we adopted the salpeter initial mass function extending from 0.1 to 100 @xmath51 .",
    "the sed ages range from 100 myr to 10 gyr or to the age of the universe at the corresponding redshift .",
    "the reddening parameter @xmath52 was allowed to change from 0 to 1.8 according to the simple two - component model of charlot & fall ( 2000 ) .",
    "+ from the comparison of @xmath53 versus @xmath54 , we find that contamination from low - redshift interlopers is minimal when selecting @xmath173.6 - 3.7 objects , at the redshift interval of @xmath55 .",
    "when we restrict the redshift interval as above , the scatter in the @xmath54 versus @xmath53 relation is about 0.1 after excluding several clear outliers .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath55 as the interval for the photo-@xmath56 sample selection .",
    "this gives 60 objects in total , including 17 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with good @xmath53 quality flags ( b or better ) at @xmath263.6 - 3.7 .",
    "note that we use @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 when available , but restrict the spectroscopic redshift range to be @xmath57 . with the photo-@xmath56 selection criteria , 73% of @xmath583.6 - 3.7 galaxies",
    "are detected as @xmath233.6 - 3.7 galaxy candidates .",
    "the contamination rate is 26% , but the contamination due to low redshift objects ( @xmath59 ) is zero .",
    "most of the contamination comes from @xmath60 objects .",
    "we searched for the overdensities by running circular top - hat filters with various diameters ( @xmath61 to @xmath62 , corresponding to 0.2 - 2 mpc at @xmath63 ) on the two - dimensional spatial distribution of galaxies in the above samples .",
    "the number of objects was counted around a given point within a circle with a particular diameter , producing a density contour map .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the surface number density contour map and the location of @xmath2-selected sample and photo-@xmath56 selected objects , respectively . here",
    ", the contours are created using @xmath64 diameter filters , which corresponds to @xmath91.0 mpc in physical size at @xmath63 .",
    "the 1 mpc size is found to be the optimal size to identify the @xmath63 overdensity ( see below ) .",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies are plotted with squares ( @xmath65 ) , diamonds ( @xmath66 ) , and triangles ( @xmath67 ) , and the open stars represent agns at @xmath583.66 and 3.70 from szokoly et al .",
    "one density peak is apparent , located in the southern part of the cdf - s ( a in figure 2(a ) ) , around @xmath3 , @xmath4 agns , and @xmath68=3.70 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs , diamonds ) .",
    "another possible peak exists in the north around @xmath69 3.60 lbgs ( b ) , but its significance is much weaker .    ccccc @xmath2-selected sample & 1.48 & 0.64 & 4.94 & 2.52 + @xmath70 & 0.37 & 0.27 & 6.86 & 1.96 + sum of two samples & 1.68 & 0.69 & 6.18 & 2.37 +    to quantify the statistical significance of these peaks , we measured the overdensity factor as a number of @xmath5 from the mean surface number density by performing a gaussian fit over the surface number density histogram .",
    "the significances of the overdensities are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the significance of the overdensity is @xmath71 for the a overdensity , demonstrating that its significance is very strong .",
    "the significance of the overdensity does not change for the top - hat filter size between 0.75 and 1.3 mpc . beyond these sizes ,",
    "the significance decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "the b overdensity has a significance of only @xmath72 .    with the limited number of spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "assigning redshifts of the overdense regions is not an easy task .",
    "nevertheless , we find several redshifts to be plausible .",
    "the redshift distribution of cdf - s galaxies with @xmath53 shows three distinct peaks at @xmath29 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 ( figure 2(b ) ) .",
    "the majority of @xmath74 objects are located around the overdense area a ( filled histogram ) , as well as two agns at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , suggesting strongly that this overdensity is at @xmath11 .",
    "there are also several @xmath29 galaxies near the a overdensity . however , the overdensity is more likely to be at @xmath0 , since the overdense area is clearly identified in the contour map of the @xmath2 sample which effectively filters out @xmath27 galaxies .    around the weak , overdense region",
    "b , we find six lbgs with @xmath77 , and find a one - dimensional velocity dispersion of @xmath78 km s@xmath8 for these objects",
    ". the b overdense region may be a loosely bound overdensity at @xmath79 .",
    "we examined whether the number of high - redshift candidates is abnormally high in this field compared to other fields . for this , we examined only the @xmath2-selected sample , since the photo-@xmath56 sample does not have comparative samples readily available .",
    "we studied the number density of @xmath2-selected objects in the goods - north field to compare with the cdf - s . using the version r1.1 acs multiband source catalog",
    ", we find 220 @xmath2-selected objects in the goods - north field ( see giavalisco et al .",
    "this gives the surface density @xmath80 = 1.38 @xmath81 0.07 arcmin@xmath33 , comparable to the number in cdf - s ( @xmath32 arcmin@xmath33 ) .",
    "we also looked for a sign of overdensity at @xmath0 using the @xmath2-selected sample in the goods - north field .",
    "we find the strongest overdensity has the overdensity significance of @xmath82 .",
    "this suggests that the goods - north may contain a weak overdense area at @xmath0 , but its significance is much lower than the overdense region we identified in the cdf - s .      in order to find massive galaxies associated with the overdense regions , we performed sed fittings to 60 galaxies in the photo-@xmath56 sample following the procedure of shim et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , with the sed templates used for the photometric redshift determination .",
    "note that we have limited the sed fitting to objects with irac data in order to reduce uncertainties and degeneracies arising from using only the rest - frame optical data .    in figure 3",
    ", we show the best - fit seds of two representative massive galaxies at the overdense region a in the cdf - s .",
    "we find 35 galaxies with @xmath83 over the whole cdf - s area .",
    "more than 43% ( 15 ) of these massive objects are located within @xmath9 1 mpc radius of the overdensity peak of the a region .",
    "this offers a further support for the existence of @xmath0 overdensity .",
    "we also checked the usefulness of the @xmath84 color selection of @xmath0 as advocated by brammer & van dokkum ( 2007 ) .",
    "they suggest that objects with @xmath85 mag are likely to be at @xmath86 based on their photometric redshift analysis .",
    "however , our analysis shows that only about 30% of @xmath85 objects are at @xmath87 , for both the @xmath53 and the @xmath54 samples .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the usefulness of the @xmath85 selection method is limited .",
    "we estimate the overdensity mass in several different ways for the a area .",
    "first , we assume that it is a virialized structure , following biviano et al .",
    "this assumption is not plausible , considering that the age of the universe is only 1.6 gyr at @xmath63 , while it takes nearly several gyr for galaxies to cross the 1 mpc structure at the given velocity dispersion .",
    "nevertheless , the method can place a useful upper limit on the overdensity mass .",
    "for the cluster size , we use the harmonic mean radius of the photo-@xmath56 selected objects within a 1 mpc radius ( twice the filter size that gives the maximal overdensity signal ) from the overdensity center .",
    "this gives a size of 0.55 mpc .",
    "assuming that the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath88 , of several possible proto - cluster members with @xmath53 is a representative value , we estimate the cluster virial mass using the gapper estimator ( beers et al .",
    "we find that @xmath89 800 km s@xmath8 by excluding a small redshift peak at @xmath90 .",
    "the derived cluster virial mass is , then @xmath91 .",
    "next , we apply a procedure similar to that of venemans et al .",
    "( 2005 ) on the @xmath54-selected sample .",
    "suppose that the cluster is roughly spherical , and has a 0.55 mpc radius equivalent to the harmonic mean radius as derived above .",
    "using the range @xmath92 as the selection window , we find an overdensity factor of @xmath93 .",
    "adopting the bias parameter of @xmath94 of b - dropouts in the cdf - s ( lee et al .",
    "2006 ) , we obtain a cluster mass of @xmath95 @xmath51 .    finally , we add up the stellar mass of the member candidates within the 0.55 mpc radius , and convert it to the total mass assuming a @xmath96-to-@xmath97 ratio of 0.026 - 0.056 of early - type galaxies",
    "( jiang & kochanek 2007 ) . here",
    ", the overdensity mass can be expressed as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are , respectively , the number and the average mass of galaxies with @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is the ratio of the mass of galaxies with @xmath103 to those with @xmath104 . in our case , we have @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we adopt @xmath107 , which is the ratio of the luminosity density of @xmath108 galaxies to that of @xmath109 galaxies in the schechter function with faint - end slope @xmath110 - 1.24 ( e.g , rines & geller 2008 ) .",
    "this gives an overdensity mass of ( 2.1 - 4.6)@xmath12    it is interesting that several independent mass estimates give the overdensity mass to be @xmath111 a few @xmath112 .",
    "the implausible assumption of the virialization even gives a mass consistent with other estimates .",
    "this suggests that the virialization of the proto - cluster may soon be completed .",
    "however , the expected number density of halos as massive as a few @xmath112 at @xmath113 is extremely low with @xmath114 mpc@xmath115 @xcite , and the probability of finding such a halo in the cdf - s is only @xmath116 .",
    "this structure can be a part of the filaments and walls at high redshift as well .",
    "the existence of another weak overdense area such as the b overdensity supports such an idea .",
    "a careful analysis of simulation data should help us understand the nature of these kinds of overdensities .",
    "by examining the two - dimensional distribution of @xmath117 candidates in the cdf - s field selected from the photometric redshift method or the @xmath2 color - color space , we find plausible associations of the overdense region of such objects with agns and lbgs at @xmath118 .",
    "the significance of the overdense regions is found to be @xmath71 .",
    "the overdense area is abundant with massive galaxies , adding further support that this is a proto - cluster .",
    "the derived mass of the proto - cluster is found to be a few @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath51 .",
    "the existence of the massive proto - cluster in the cdf - s shows that one must be cautious when examining the significance of high redshift overdensities in other fields with respect to the cdf - s .",
