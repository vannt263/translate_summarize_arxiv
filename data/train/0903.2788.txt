    "in the years since the wmap satellite provided the first precise measurement of the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , a consensus has emerged in which inflation is the most likely candidate for the origin of the primordial density perturbation .",
    "if this is true it will almost certainly require the presence of new degrees of freedom at a scale associated with the inflationary era , perhaps in the region @xmath0  ",
    "@xmath1 gev , and would represent a remarkable discovery of new physics at an energy at least @xmath2 times the accessible limit at the large hadron collider and far beyond the reach of any terrestrial experiment .",
    "the prospect of discoveries such as these has led to significant investment in microwave background experiments , which are now approaching the sensitivity required to detect effects taking place at subleading order in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "these effects are expected to play a crucial role in discriminating among the competing theories which could account for the gross gaussian , adiabatic and scale - invariant character of the inflationary density perturbation .",
    "indeed , one immediate consequence of our imminent ability to measure such tiny contributions has been a strong pressure to develop and refine the theory of inflationary perturbations , which underlies the interpretation of all cmb observations . at a practical level",
    "this has led to the availability of full predictions for the non - linearity in the three- and four - point correlation functions of the primordial curvature perturbation in single - field inflation @xcite and partial predictions in multi - field models @xcite . at a more conceptual level ,",
    "interesting new approaches have been developed by borrowing the idea of an _ effective field theory _ from particle physics @xcite .",
    "these enable us to ask fundamental questions about theories of inflation without making a commitment to any specific model .",
    "an example of such a fundamental question concerns the validity of perturbation theory . during inflation",
    "there are at least two interesting perturbative scales .",
    "the first is a measure of the deceleration of the hubble rate , defined by @xmath3 , which provides an indication of the time scale over which the vacuum expectation values of background fields are coherently evolving due to macroscopic classical effects .",
    "the second is the ratio of the hubble scale to the planck scale , @xmath4 , which determines the importance of higher orders in perturbation theory associated with `` quantum '' corrections .",
    "our ability to extract predictions from any theory of inflation is usually limited to the lowest few orders in both @xmath5 and @xmath4 , or other related small quantities .",
    "unfortunately , it has been known for a long time that such predictions can be afflicted with infra - red divergences which compensate for the smallness of these expansion parameters and spoil our ability to perform meaningful calculations @xcite .",
    "these divergences have been explored in a series of papers by woodard and collaborators : see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite which contain references to the earlier literature .",
    "we would like to be sure that when we make predictions which are to be compared with precision cmb data , we obtain the right answer for the right reason . to achieve this confidence in our quantitative predictions , and the methods used to obtain them , it is important to arrive at a clear understanding of infra - red issues .",
    "accordingly , they have been subject to investigation by many authors @xcite .",
    "the presence of large infra - red effects is symptomatic of computing an observable defined on some particular length scale within a much larger patch of de sitter space @xcite , leading to the existence of a large hierarchy of scales .",
    "it is the logarithm of this hierarchy which enters in conjunction with the scales @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and spoils nave perturbation theory .",
    "whenever large logarithms of this sort play a significant role in quantum field theory , it is usually the case that their resummation can be described by the renormalization group equation .",
    "we should therefore expect that significant infra - red effects , if they exist , can be accommodated within this framework @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been suggested by many authors that the stochastic approach to inflation , originally pioneered by starobinsky @xcite , functions as an infra - red regulator and leads to infra - red finite predictions @xcite . in this interpretation",
    ", the presence of large infra - red terms should be understood to reflect the potential for large fluctuations to build up between widely separated points in de sitter space , and eventually a sensitivity to the onset of eternal inflation .",
    "this prescription was suggested earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this resolution of the problem of infra - red divergences , if correct , would be quite remarkable .",
    "however , it presents a number of puzzles .",
    "firstly , we are used to applications in which the renormalization group equation leads to screening of masses and couplings constants in the ultra - violet , rather than some form of stochastic dynamics .",
    "it is not so easy to see how the two approaches could be related .",
    "secondly , although one can check , once a stochastic formulation is available , that it correctly reproduces correct infra - red behaviour , it would be nice to have an argument which begins with the existence of large infra - red logarithms and arrives at the langevin equation which describes starobinsky s stochastic dynamics . for this purpose , one can seek analogies in other examples of field theory where infra - red effects play an important role .",
    "the key example of this type occurs in hadron physics , where the fundamental degrees of freedom belonging to the gauge theory of colour the quarks and gluons  are confined by soft qcd effects .    in this paper",
    "i would like to suggest that although a large hierarchy of scales in de sitter space can certainly be understood in terms of renormalization group flow , an even better analogy might be with the dokshitzer ",
    "gribov  lipatov ",
    "altarelli  parisi ( dglap ) equation @xcite which describes the evolution of parton distribution functions within a hadron .",
    "these distribution functions satisfy an equation itself a manifestation of the renormalization group which endows them with a slow logarithmic variation as one changes the energy scale at which the target hadron is to be probed . in this analogy",
    ", one can show that the dglap equation _",
    "precisely _ reproduces the fokker ",
    "planck equation obtained by starobinsky .",
    "this equation describes the diffusion of probability in time as a light scalar field in de sitter space evolves in the presence of quantum effects .",
    "this fokker ",
    "planck equation could therefore be interpreted as _",
    "the _ de sitter renormalization group equation .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : hadrons ] the parton picture of hadron structure is briefly recalled , in a form which will allow easy generalization to de sitter space .",
    "this generalization is performed in   [ sec : desitter][sec : predictions ] .",
    "finally , i conclude with a discussion in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "two appendices supplement the discussion of the stochastic formulation of inflation which occurs in the main text .",
    "starobinsky s original argument , based on a recursive coarse - graining of the heisenberg field and the introduction of a langevin equation , is recalled in [ sec : starobinsky ] .",
    "in addition , to aid comparison of the argument given in the present paper with that of other authors , [ sec : fokkerplanck ] gives two derivations of the corresponding fokker ",
    "planck equation , one based on it s stochastic calculus and the other on a conventional path integral .",
    "some issues tangential to the main discussion are briefly summarized in [ sec : subtleties ] .    throughout this paper ,",
    "units are chosen so that @xmath6 and the reduced planck mass ( defined by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is newton s gravitational constant ) is set to unity .",
    "the metric is chosen with sign convention @xmath9 .",
    "the parton picture of hadron structure grew out of the analysis of so - called _ deep inelastic scattering _ experiments ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dis ] ) , which involved collisions between electrons and protons in which a large invariant momentum @xmath10 was transferred from the @xmath11 beam to the target proton . in these experiments",
    "it was observed that the scattering rate behaved as if the electrons were interacting with an elementary electromagnetically charged fermion , whereas such hard scattering behaviour was virtually absent in direct proton ",
    "proton collisions . to explain these observations , bjorken and paschos @xcite and",
    "feynman @xcite proposed that hadrons could be understood as a loosely bound collection of pointlike constituents , called _",
    "partons_. in this picture , the electron ( which does not feel the strong force ) does not interact with the hadron as a whole but rather scatters incoherently from one of its constituents .",
    "( 150,100 )    in modern terms the partons can be identified with quarks and gluons , which are the fundamental degrees of freedom of qcd . at low energies these",
    "are confined into colour - neutral states by soft processes , giving hadrons a characteristic size of order @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the pion mass and @xmath14 is the qcd scale . at energies much greater than @xmath15 the quarks and gluons",
    "behave roughly like a plasma of free particles .",
    "the parton model can only be expected to supply a good approximation if the impinging electron is sufficiently energetic to resolve the internal structure of the target hadron .",
    "this internal structure is described by so - called parton distribution functions , labelled @xmath16 ( but varying from hadron to hadron ) for each species @xmath17 which can be present , and defined so that @xmath18 is the probability of finding a constituent parton of species @xmath17 carrying a fraction @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) of the parent hadron s total momentum",
    ". these can be thought of as coarse - grainings over the hadron wavefunction . since",
    "the partons are supposed to be bound within the hadron , their momenta transverse to its direction of propagation must all be small and to a good approximation the partons can be taken to move collinearly .",
    "the leading corrections to this picture will be suppressed by powers of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is of order the typical transverse 3-momentum ( of order @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the 3-momentum of the parent hadron .",
    "once the parton distribution functions are at our disposal , and taking into account the assumption that a probe scatters incoherently off a single constituent parton , it is clear how we can write the cross - section for a deep inelastic scattering event . in the case described in fig .  , where an electron of momentum @xmath25 disrupts a hadron of momentum @xmath26 , it follows that @xmath27 for any hadronic final state @xmath28 , where the sum over @xmath29 includes all quark flavours , with quarks and antiquarks contributing separately .",
    "similar formulae can be obtained for any desired partonic interaction : the general scheme is always parallel to eq .  , which factorizes into a hard subprocess describing interactions among the partons and a soft parton distribution function .",
    "the hard subprocess is independent of the hadron in which the partons are contained , and the parton distribution function is independent of the interaction which takes place . in particular , the distributions @xmath16 depend only on @xmath19 and are independent of the momentum transfer @xmath10 which is carried by the intermediate boson in fig .  [ fig : dis ] .",
    "this behaviour is known as _",
    "bjorken scaling _ @xcite .    a cross - section such as eq",
    ".   is called `` inclusive , '' because it does not distinguish between the various allowed final hadronic states @xmath28 .",
    "it is sometimes possible to measure more `` exclusive '' ( or `` semi - inclusive '' ) rates which discriminate among the hadrons which can be present in @xmath28 . to describe such exclusive rates one can introduce fragmentation functions @xmath30 , which are the final - state analogues of the parton distribution functions @xmath31 : these give the probability for a parton of species @xmath17 to produce a hadron @xmath32 in the final state which carries a fraction @xmath33 of the parent parton s momentum .",
    "an exclusive cross - section can be written in a form analogous to eq .  , using the fragmentation functions to sum the final - state products of the hard subprocess into final - state products of the overall hadronic process .",
    "the parton picture was introduced as a phenomenological model , with some basis in an intuitive understanding of hadron physics . as such it is independent of qcd itself , or more generally the existence of an underlying gauge theory which exhibits confinement in the infra - red .",
    "it is only the identification of partons with the fundamental excitations of an asymptotically free non - abelian field theory which invests the model with real meaning .",
    "indeed , the parton model can be formally derived from qcd @xcite .      in the simplest parton model ,",
    "bjorken scaling is exact .",
    "however , if qcd processes are taken into account this is no longer true ; instead , a tower of infra - red divergences appears which can compensate for the smallness of the qcd coupling constant at high energy .",
    "when resummed , these divergences predict slow violations of bjorken scaling and give rise to evolution equations which control how the parton distributions functions @xmath16 ( and fragmentation functions @xmath34 ) evolve with the momentum scale @xmath10 at which the hadron is to be probed .    what is the origin of these qcd effects ?",
    "consider any process with outgoing quarks . at the point where these leave the diagram ,",
    "any such process must contain a vertex of the form    ,    where the dashed line is connected to the rest of the diagram .",
    "however , nothing can prevent the outgoing quarks from radiating gluons , which means that at leading order in the strong coupling constant , @xmath35 , we must also include diagrams of the form    .",
    "the first of these diagrams is a loop correction , which can produce a divergence when the momentum carried by the circulating gluon approaches zero .",
    "the remaining two diagrams account for gluon radiation from the outgoing quarks , and include soft gluons in the final state .",
    "if @xmath35 is small , these diagrams will be suppressed compared to the undressed diagram without gluon radiation .",
    "unfortunately , however , these gluon - corrected diagrams may be singular when the momenta carried by the final - state gluons approaches zero , or where they are emitted collinearly with the outgoing quark . in some cases",
    "the divergences produced by the combination of these diagrams cancel , but there is no reason of principle for this to occur .",
    "similar corrections must be taken into account for ingoing particles . where cancellation does not occur , any left - over divergences may overcome the smallness of @xmath35 and cause the parton content encountered by an impinging hard particle to evolve with @xmath10 .    the physical meaning of this evolution is simple to understand .",
    "an isolated quark propagating according to the usual rules of quantum field theory is not alone , but rather is accompanied by a cloud of virtual particles which are constantly being emitted and re - absorbed by the physical quark .",
    "any projectile which strikes the cloud with sufficiently high energy has an opportunity to resolve and interact with one of the virtual particles in its interior , rather than the parent quark . as @xmath10 increases",
    ", such a projectile can resolve vacuum fluctuations with increasingly short lifetimes .",
    "it follows that the composition of the virtual cloud must exhibit a slow variation with @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , we can imagine it to be governed by a system of equations of boltzmann type , which describe a sort of equilibrium among the various species of particle which can exist within the cloud .",
    "these are the dglap equations , sometimes known ( especially in the older literature ) as the altarelli  parisi equations . in the context of qcd",
    "they were obtained by altarelli & parisi @xcite using the method of the operator product expansion .",
    "their interpretation as an approximate boltzmann system was given later by collins & qiu @xcite .",
    "consider any parton which is destined to interact with some impinging projectile @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath36 is sufficiently energetic , it is possible to resolve processes by which the parton brakes into ( or out of ) the collision through emission ",
    "bremsstrahlung  of soft quanta , as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : braking - radiation ] .",
    "( 150,100 )    if the parton is moving increasingly off - shell as it passes from the outside of the emission chain towards the collision region , then each radiation event can be accompanied by a large infra - red logarithm .",
    "it follows that to obtain a meaningful picture of this cascade of emission events , we must resum all diagrams with the form of fig .",
    "[ fig : braking - radiation ] which describe radiation of an arbitrary number of soft quanta .",
    "any diagram of this type , involving radiation of @xmath37 quanta , can be built by sewing together @xmath37 copies for the diagram for emission of a single quantum . to deal with this , one can write the probability for an incoming parton ( say of species @xmath17 ) to resolve into an outgoing parton of species @xmath29 with a fraction @xmath33 of its original momentum , accounting for radiation of a single soft particle with transverse energy @xmath38 , in terms of the so - called _ altarelli  parisi splitting function _",

    "in what follows , it has been assumed that @xmath45 and that terms of order @xmath46 or smaller are negligible .",
    "one can understand the form of this equation by observing that if @xmath47 , so that no soft particle is radiated , then the original parton must remain at its initial momentum .",
    "this accounts for the leading term @xmath44 . on the other hand , if a particle of momentum @xmath38 is radiated , it is possible for the original parton to downgrade its momentum to some fraction @xmath48 .",
    "the potential for this degradation is suppressed by the coupling @xmath35 , but can be enhanced if the available phase space @xmath38 is large .    to avoid complications ,",
    "let us restrict attention to a single parton species @xmath17 which does not undergo transmutation to or from any other species .",
    "the parton distribution function @xmath31 evolves according to the master equation @xmath49 this is a principle of detailed balance , or chapman  kolmogorov equation , in which we account for all the ways a parton could arrive at momentum fraction @xmath19 at the probe scale @xmath50 by summing over an intermediate step at a probe scale @xmath10 . passing to the continuum limit ,",
    "one arrives at an integro - differential equation which describes the evolution of @xmath16 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 this is the prototype dglap equation .",
    "it has the characteristic form of a renormalization group equation in @xmath51 .",
    "if other species of parton , say of type @xmath29 , can evolve into @xmath17-partons by soft emission then one must include splitting functions of the form @xmath53 in eqs .",
    " which couple @xmath31 to the relevant @xmath54 . by this process",
    "one arrives at a system of equations which can be thought of as an approximate boltzmann hierarchy with collision integrals given by the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    ". accounts of all these complexities can be found in the literature ; see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "eq .   must be supplemented with an appropriate boundary condition which determines the starting point for the dglap evolution . for partons confined within hadrons , such as quarks and gluons",
    ", a boundary condition can not be obtained from first principles because the distribution functions @xmath16 depend on soft qcd effects which are presently incalculable .",
    "instead , a set of distribution functions at some given scale must be extracted from experiment and the dglap evolution of these distribution functions can be compared with the observed distributions at a different scale . at present",
    ", this approach gives reasonable agreement between theory and observation . on the other hand",
    ", the foregoing discussion applies just as well for particles which can exist in isolation , such as an electron .",
    "for such particles , it is easy to find an appropriate boundary condition .",
    "for example , when probed at a scale corresponding to its own compton wavelength , an electron should resolve only into itself and not any member of its surrounding cloud .",
    "therefore we should set @xmath55 at @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the electron mass .",
    "a similar discussion can be given for the fragmentation functions @xmath34 .",
    "to leading order in @xmath35 the splitting functions @xmath58 are the same for both , although differences occur at higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , the fragmentation functions also evolve according to a dglap equation which has the form of eq .  .",
    "what has been achieved by using eq .   to evolve the parton distribution functions between two widely separated probe scales ( say @xmath10 and @xmath59 ) ?",
    "although eq .   gives a correct accounting of all powers of @xmath38 terms in the continuum limit , it is not necessarily exact because the probability function @xmath41 must be computed by assembling feynman diagrams into s - matrix elements .",
    "it is therefore a perturbative expansion in powers of the strong coupling constant , @xmath35 , and perhaps other small quantities .",
    "if we work to leading order in @xmath35 , the solution of the dglap equation will account correctly for all terms of the form @xmath60 .",
    "however , it will _ not _ give useful information regarding terms which are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath35 , such as @xmath61 .",
    "this level of precision is known as the _ leading - logarithm approximation _",
    ", sometimes abbreviated as `` lla '' . better approximations , which account for terms suppressed by extra powers of @xmath35 , can be found by retaining higher powers of the coupling constant in @xmath41 .    the leading - logarithm approximation has a particular interpretation in terms of the emission chain depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : braking - radiation ] . terms which contribute at leading logarithmic order arise from the region of phase space where the cascade of emitted quanta is _ strongly ordered _",
    "@xcite , in the sense that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the invariant transverse momentum carried away by the @xmath64th quantum radiated in the cascade , remembering that the label ` 1 ' is attached to the quantum closest to the collision region whereas quanta labelled by higher @xmath64 are increasingly distant . other configurations of radiative cascade are possible , such as emission of two or more particles at roughly equal @xmath10 , but since there is only a single logarithm for each hierarchy in @xmath10 and each emission costs a factor @xmath35 these configurations contribute at the next - to - leading logarithm approximation ( `` nlla '' ) or lower .",
    "the leading logarithm resummation only gives a meaningful approximation if all significant effects actually arise from the large logarithms under consideration . in hadron physics",
    ", large effects can also arise from evolution at small bjorken-@xmath19 , where @xmath65 logarithms can make a dominant contribution to the physics .",

    "remarkably , it will be possible to find analogues for all the concepts which played a role in the discussion of hadrons and parton evolution outlined in  [ sec : hadrons ] , including the parton distribution and fragmentation functions , and the strongly - ordered radiative cascade .",
    "the most significant difference is that the parton distribution is no longer probed by an impinging projectile such as an electron , because in calculating the density perturbation generated during inflation there is no analogue of a scattering event .",
    "nevertheless , the concept of a probe is still implicitly present in the guise of sampling the density fluctuation smoothed on hubble - sized regions .",
    "indeed , the wavenumber corresponding to the hubble scale satisfies @xmath66 and it will transpire that @xmath25 plays the role of the probe momentum @xmath67 , whereas the expectation values of the scalar fields which characterize the de sitter phase play the role of the bjorken variable @xmath19 .    these ideas will be developed in this section , in the course of which it will be possible to transcribe eqs .",
    " and the strong ordering condition to the theory of density fluctuations from slow - roll inflation . in  [ sec : desitter - ir ] the problem of secular infra - red effects in de sitter correlation functions is outlined , before proceeding to the leading - logarithm resummation of these terms in  [ sec : dglap ] .      the calculation of @xmath64-point correlation functions during a phase of quasi - de sitter inflation , and in particular those for @xmath68 , has been studied intensively over the last several years .",
    "the aim is to compute the expectation value , at time @xmath69 , of some product of fluctuations @xmath70 which begin in the vacuum state , for which the appropriate tool is schwinger s formulation of expectation values in terms of a closed contour of integration over time @xcite .",

    ", the fluctuation simply amounts to shifting the background field by some amount and must therefore evolve coherently with it .",
    "more generally , each of the diagrams in   is typically calculated by working to leading order in quantities of order @xmath5 , and higher powers in the expansion should be expected to be accompanied by powers of @xmath91 which will invalidate the use of perturbation theory after @xmath92 e - folds @xcite .",
    "loop diagrams contribute different infra - red effects .",
    "these are systematic corrections to each of the @xmath64-point graphs which account for processes by which an external particle radiates into new quanta , which later coalesce and exit the diagram by a different external leg .",

    "it is reasonable to suppose that the explanation of these large effects is similar to the large infra - red effects of qcd , with @xmath99 effects resummed into distribution functions and @xmath91 effects resummed into fragmentation functions .",
    "this leads to a highly intuitive picture . indeed , in the case of hadrons , resummation entails considering dressed diagrams with extra soft particles in the initial or final states . in a box of de sitter space",

    "these terms therefore contribute _ formally _ at next - to - leading logarithmic order or below and , if desired , could be included to find the next - order corrections to the dglap equation .",

    "moreover , to avoid complications , let us agree that correlation functions of the fundamental fields are `` observable '' when evaluated at the end of inflation . in practice , the input to standard cosmological perturbation theory would be the correlation functions , evaluated at horizon re - entry , for the curvature perturbation and some number of isocurvature modes , but such issues play no role in the resummation of infra - red effects and can easily be accommodated by standard methods .    with these considerations in mind",

    "in the language of the cascade , a three - point function with one momentum squeezed to zero corresponds at leading order to the forbidden process of tadpole emission , and therefore vanishes .",
    "however , it must be remembered that the hard sub - process , here @xmath198 , was computed in the wrong background .",

    "the dglap equation which describes the radiation process at leading - logarithm order is exactly starobinsky s diffusion equation for the probability density function in stochastic inflation .",
    "it follows that on superhorizon scales one can think of time evolution in a slow - roll phase of de sitter expansion as an increasing refinement of the scale on which features can be resolved .",
    "as we anticipated at the outset , this increasing refinement can be understood as a form of renormalization group flow .",
    "how can we reconcile the stochastic nature of the starobinsky  dglap equation with our experience of the renormalization group in the ultra - violet , which ordinarily leads to screening of masses and coupling constants but not stochastic dynamics ?",
    "when we use the rules of quantum field theory to compute scattering amplitudes or decay rates of point particles in an interacting theory , we imagine the bare degrees of freedom to be surrounded by an unresolved cloud of virtual fluctuations . an impinging particle which probes this cloud at some energy scale can not distinguish short - lived higher - energy fluctuations within the cloud , so we must replace the bare degrees of freedom by the average effect of scattering off the unresolved cloud .",
    "when we integrate the renormalization group from the ultra - violet towards the infra - red we add new modes to the unresolved cloud and average over their contributions , replacing our original point particle description by a new one .",
    "as modes are added to the cloud , the masses and couplings of the point particle are slowly screened as increasing numbers of unresolvable quanta contribute incoherently to the averaging procedure . in the dglap equation , for hadrons and de sitter",
    "equally , we are driving the renormalization group flow in the opposite direction .",
    "in these cases we begin with the existence of an unresolved cloud , and attempt to understand its composition as the probe moves to higher energy scales : in other words , whether we obtain screening or stochastic dynamics is a question of the boundary condition we adopt .",
    "the stochastic character of the dglap equation is a proxy for the inherent quantum mechanical uncertainty with which quanta become resolved from the cloud , but in either case the _ physical _ picture is the same .    in the renormalization group picture ,",
    "time evolution becomes the direction of the renormalization group flow for the simple reason that it is time evolution which causes the probe scale  the hubble scale  to vary .",
    "it is not ordinarily possible to understand time evolution in these terms , because evolution equations are typically second order differential equations and do not admit a renormalization group interpretation .",
    "the crucial ingredient is the slow - roll approximation , which allows the relevant evolution equations to be truncated to first order .",
    "one is immediately led to suspect that the underlying structure which allows such a description is connected to a holographic interpretation of de sitter space , or the proposed `` ds / cft correspondence . ''",
    "there are reasons to believe that a ds / cft correspondence may not exist in the same way as the well - established ads / cft correspondence , but many important features of the ads / cft holographic renormalization group flow are known to have analogues in de sitter space .",
    "these flows have already been shown to reproduce many aspects of the standard theory of inflationary perturbations @xcite .",
    "there appear to be significant obstructions to interpreting a phase of de sitter evolution directly in terms of the parton evolution of some gauge field theory .",
    "although some aspects are quite analogous  the occurence of a dglap regime , or the apparent existence of saturation scales associated the inverse coupling ",
    "some are quite different .",
    "most strikingly , there are no degrees of freedom in the de sitter picture which could play the role of bjorken variables describing the gluons of an underlying gauge theory .",
    "the gluons are expected to play a dominant role at very high energies , resulting in the formation of the so - called _ colour glass condensate _ @xcite . at these energies ,",
    "multiple gluon splittings tend to fill any hadron wavefunction with a universal cascade of soft gluons carrying deeply degraded momenta . in this regime",
    "large effects contributed by @xmath65 logarithms require the dglap equation to be replaced by the so - called balitsky  jimwlk equation or its relatives @xcite . in the case of an @xmath181-symmetric scalar field theory in de sitter space",
    "one could define variables more precisely analogous to the bjorken @xmath19 by setting @xmath201 , where @xmath202 , and for which @xmath203 . a field at sufficiently small @xmath204 has a small expectation value in comparison with other fields whose expectation values are approaching the planck scale , and in this regime one would also expect significant corrections in the de sitter case .",
    "although an underlying gauge theory is lacking in de sitter , it is interesting that one can find a partial , qualitative analogue of the confinement phase transition by which coloured degrees of freedom are softly bound into colourless states at an energy scale around @xmath205 .",
    "this is the phase transition between eternal inflation and slow - roll inflation towards a terminal vacuum @xcite , which starobinsky called the `` useful '' part of inflation in his original paper on the stochastic formalism @xcite .",
    "the division between these phases is marked by the self - reproduction scale , which is accessible to the degree that it sits below the planck mass in many models . in the eternal phase , which we could perhaps loosely imagine as a sort of confined phase for a box of de sitter space",
    ", the partons are strongly interacting and the trajectories of hubble - sized regions in field space mix randomly .",
    "in the terminal phase the partons are weakly interacting and trajectories become collimated , moving on parallel paths in field space .",
    "there is an analogy , too , with the asymptotic freedom of qcd by which the theory becomes non - interacting at high energies : as the coupling @xmath93 decreases , interactions can be described increasingly well by a free scalar field theory without dynamical gravity @xcite .",
    "however , one should remember that all these observations are purely qualitative .    what have we learned from the study of infra - red effects ?",
    "there seem to be two clear conclusions , both of which have already been emphasized in the literature by authors working with different methods .",
    "firstly , in making a prediction for what can be observed in the cmb one should carry out the calculation within a box that is in the neighbourhood of a terminal vacuum , by which is meant that the box as a whole ( up to fluctuations described by the curvature perturbation ) is evolving towards the hypersurface on which inflation ends .",
    "one can certainly get a different answer by calculating within a much larger box , but the difference arises because one includes in the average the possibility that some regions of the box are characterized by scalar vevs which are some way from the terminal vacuum @xcite",
    ". therefore one should replace eq .   by a similar equation in which the distribution function @xmath163 is replaced by the probability",
    "that , given inflation is about to end , the scalar vevs take particular values . for single field inflation this probability is simply a @xmath144-function and the entire infra - red structure decouples from the theory @xcite . where more than one field is present",
    ", there can be a non - trivial effect if inflation can end in different ways at different points in field space , or if one can obtain slightly different predictions by rolling into the same terminal vacuum from different directions .",
    "a special case of these observations applies to the calculation of non - gaussian effects .",
    "although it has been known for a long time that one can obtain significant non - gaussianity from large scale stochastic fluctuations @xcite , such long wavelength phenomena can not be the source of any non - gaussian effects presently observed in the cmb . as new modes fall within our hubble volume",
    "there is the prospect that we may eventually be able to interact with non - gaussian fluctuations on very long wavelengths , but if this possibility exists it would seem to do so only in our long - term future . in making predictions for non - gaussian fluctuations based on selection of specific trajectories in field space",
    ", one should therefore be careful that the trajectory does not intersect a phase of eternal inflation , and can be smoothly glued on to a prescription for exiting inflation .",
    "likewise , if large infra - red loop corrections occur in making predictions for any correlation function , then these will generally require resummation before such correlators can be interpreted as observables .",
    "secondly , since what we can observe is conditioned upon proximity to the end of inflation , it is clear that we can not presently probe the large - scale structure generated by eternal inflation @xcite .",
    "this is like universality in the ultra - violet renormalization group flow , which prevents us from extrapolating the details of quantum gravity near the planck mass from observations made at more pedestrian scales .",
    "for example , if we wish to obtain top - down predictions from an _ a priori _ model , perhaps obtained by construction from string theory or some other model of high - energy physics , then there may exist a landscape of vacua in which inflation can end , and the situation becomes very complicated .",
    "one nave way to find a measure on this landscape would be to allow the scalar expectation values to diffuse over the landscape , and record the frequency with which they fall into terminal vacua .",
    "unfortunately , even this nave approach is a difficult undertaking in its own right , and could easily be complicated by other landscape effects @xcite .",
    "these issues were discussed concretely in refs .",
    "the role of infra - red divergences in this context is to reproduce the measure problem of eternal inflation .",
    "stochastic formalisms for the purpose of computing the non - gaussianity from inflation were in use throughout the 90s @xcite and more recently have been revived by rigopoulos , shellard & van tent @xcite as a means to account for non - linear time evolution of the curvature perturbation in models where isocurvature fluctuations may be present ( see also refs .",
    "they therefore constitute an alternative to the popular @xmath193 formula , although both are based on a separate universe picture @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the stochastic formalism reproduce those of the @xmath193 formula for time evolution , since they both amount to a resummation of terms of the form @xmath206 .",
    "it is now easy to see that the argument of   [ sec : desitter][sec : predictions ] requires resummation of the @xmath207 terms in the @xmath193 formula to reproduce the stochastic component of refs .",
    "we conclude that these two methods for computing non - gaussian correlation functions can be regarded as completely equivalent .",
    "in particular , this apparently implies that the inclusion of a stochastic source does not lead to large non - gaussian signals unless one has implicitly passed to a box in which infra - red effects are important , either because of its large size or because of an interaction with eternal inflation .",
    "i would like to thank the participants at the workshop on _ non - gaussianity from fundamental physics _ ( hosted by the centre for theoretical cosmology , cambridge , in september 2008 ) for many interesting discussions .",
    "in particular , some of the ideas discussed in this paper were developed during conversations with peter adshead , neil barnaby , nicola bartolo , chris byrnes , xingang chen , emanuela dimastrogiovanni , richard easther , eugene lim , yeinzon rodrguez , sarah shandera , martin sloth , andrew tolley , cesar valenzuela - toledo , and filippo vernizzi .",

    " suffer from an operator ordering ambiguity in the term which involves @xmath277 , and ( as discussed in  [ sec : fokkerplanck ] ) is present no matter which method is chosen to obtain the starobinsky  dglap equation .",
    "it corresponds to an arbitrary choice in discretizing any stochastic process , equivalent to the distinction between the it and stratonovich integrals . in eq .",
    "this ambiguity requires a prescription for integrating out the @xmath144-function , after which some fraction of the coherent background evolution @xmath278 can be included in @xmath163 and the remainder in @xmath26 .",

    "this ambiguity is not expected to have significant consequences for inflationary predictions @xcite .",
    "secondly , should we expect corrections to the form of the diffusion equation in a more detailed treatment ? to answer this question , it is useful to observe that in the continuum limit the starobinsky  dglap equation receives _ no _ corrections from higher - order connected correlation functions .",
    "therefore the diffusion equation is unaffected by non - gaussian corrections in the splitting functions at any order .",
    "such corrections are present in loop corrections to @xmath146 , but since these loops are suppressed by extra powers of @xmath93 it is clear that non - gaussian effects do not contribute to the leading - logarithm approximation .",
    "another source of corrections to the dglap equation could have come from _",
    "disconnected _ correlation functions , proportional to two or more powers of a momentum - conservation @xmath144-function .",
    "correlation functions of this sort could contribute in a leading - logarithm approximation because the extra @xmath144-functions each remove one power of @xmath145 .",
    "their effect would be to introduce higher - derivative terms into the starobinsky  dglap equation which correct the diffusion term @xmath279 , completely changing the character of the solutions .",
    "these corrections account for non - local transitions which are not between approximately nearest - neighbour bjorken variables , and would lead to many complications .",
    "such terms can also be encountered in diffusion - type approximations to the hadron dglap equation @xcite .",
    "if the tadpole condition @xmath280 is enforced then disconnected diagrams can not contribute , because to reach leading - logarithm order such a diagram must contain at least one tadpole .",
    "it is fairly clear how this is to be interpreted .",
    "recall that multiplication by a product of disconnected diagrams can be thought of as shifting the vacuum in which we calculate any correlation function .",
    "( indeed , it is precisely to account for dressing by soft quanta , which arrange themselves into disconnected diagrams , for which we wish to use the dglap equation itself . )",
    "inclusion of a background of disconnected diagrams in the splitting functions is tantamount to an admission that further vacuum redefinitions  described in the parton picture by shifts among the bjorken variables  must be accounted for , which does not occur if the splitting functions are computed in the correct background .",
    "accordingly , we can conclude that higher - derivative corrections to the dglap equation are absent in the leading - logarithm approximation .",

    "<S> it is well - known that expectation values in de sitter space are afflicted by infra - red divergences . </S>",
    "<S> long ago , starobinsky proposed that infra - red effects in de sitter space could be accommodated by evolving the long - wavelength part of the field according to the classical equations of motion plus a stochastic source term . </S>",
    "<S> i argue that when quantum - mechanical loop corrections are taken into account the separate universe picture of superhorizon evolution in de sitter space is equivalent , in a certain leading - logarithm approximation , to starobinsky s stochastic approach . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the time evolution of a box of de sitter space can be understood in exact analogy with the dglap evolution of partons within a hadron , which describes a slow logarithmic evolution in the distribution of the hadron s constituent partons with the energy scale at which they are probed .    * keywords * : inflation , cosmological perturbation theory , physics of the early universe , quantum field theory in curved spacetime </S>",
