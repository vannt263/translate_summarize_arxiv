    "spintronics is continuing to attract considerable interest because of its potential application to information technology.@xcite several spintronics devices have been proposed that manipulate spin via spin - orbit coupling ( soc).@xcite in recent years , progress in nanofabrication and growth techniques has made it possible to produce high - quality quantum wires ( qwrs ) and investigate spin physics in semiconductor nanostructures.@xcite the energy spectrum of qwr systems with strong soc has been extensively studied.@xcite it is well known that , even in the absence of an external magnetic field , the rashba@xcite and dresselhaus@xcite socs lift the spin degeneracy in wire subbands at nonzero wave vectors .",
    "the subband structure for quantum - confined valence - band states is particularly interesting since they are subject to an especially strong soc.@xcite    as a long spin relaxation time ( srt ) is desirable for the operation of spintronic devices , many investigations have been performed to better understand the electron spin relaxation in quantum structures,@xcite e.g. , using the single - particle model@xcite or monte - carlo simulations.@xcite however , it was shown by wu _",
    "et al._@xcite that the single - particle approach is inadequate in accounting for the spin relaxation",
    ". a fully microscopic kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) theory , which takes full account of the inhomogeneous broadening from the dresselhaus and/or rashba soc and the effect of scattering , has been developed to study spin relaxation.@xcite cheng _ et al .",
    "_ applied this approach ( excluding the coulomb scattering ) to study electron spin relaxation in qwr systems and showed the feasibility of manipulating spin decoherence.@xcite investigations of spin relaxation of _ holes _ in qwrs are relatively limited,@xcite even though knowledge of hole spin relaxation in @xmath0-type qwrs is important for assessing the feasibility of hole - based spintronic devices.@xcite the spin - relaxation mechanism in hole qwrs can be expected to be quite different from that in electron systems , and 2d or bulk hole systems , due to the strong soc and the complex wire - subband structure .",
    "these effects have not been addressed previously .    in this paper , we investigate hole spin relaxation in a @xmath0-doped ( 001 ) gaas qwr .",
    "an idealized system of quantum wire with rectangular confinements and hard wall potential is considered in our calculation .",
    "first , we obtain the subband structure by diagonalizing the hole hamiltonian including the quantum confinement . here the light - hole ( lh ) admixture is dominant in the lowest spin - split subband , but the heavy - hole ( hh ) admixture becomes also important in higher subbands due to the strong hh - lh mixing . then we investigate the time evolution of holes by numerically solving the fully microscopic ksbes in the obtained subbands , with all the scattering , particularly the coulomb scattering , explicitly included .",
    "we find that the qwr size influences the srt effectively because the soc and the subband structure in qwrs depend strongly on the confinement . when the qwr size increases , the lowest spin - split subband and the second - lowest spin - split subband will get very close to each other at an anticrossing point .",
    "if the anticrossing is close to the fermi surface , the contribution from spin - flip scattering reaches a maximum and , correspondingly the srt will reach a minimum .",
    "moreover , we show that the dependence of the srt on confinement size in qwrs behaves oppositely to the trend found in quantum wells .",
    "it is also found that , when the qwr size is very small , the srt can either increase or decrease with hole density , depending on the spin mixing of the subbands .",
    "however , the behavior of holes in qwrs where the srt increases or decreases with hole density is quite different from the one of lhs in quantum wells with small well width.@xcite these features originate from the subband structure of the qwrs and the spin mixing which give rise to the spin - flip scattering .",
    "the spin mixing and inter - subband scattering are modulated more dramatically in qwrs by changing the hole distribution in different subbands .",
    "we also investigate the effects of temperature and initial spin polarization , showing that the inter - subband scattering and the coulomb hartree - fock contribution can make a marked contribution to the spin relaxation .",

    "therefore , holes populate the @xmath83 subbands only . as pointed out before , the coherent term @xmath119 is proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "as holes are only populating states in the small @xmath27 region where the spin splitting between @xmath83 is negligible , the spin precession between these two states , and thus the inhomogeneous broadening , is very small .",

    "let s look at the energy spectra for a wire with @xmath129  nm and @xmath130  nm in fig .",
    "2 . when the wire width increases , the energy gap between the @xmath83 and @xmath78 becomes smaller , and the spin mixing in the helix subbands increases .",
    "therefore , the contribution from all of the spin - flip scattering increases , and the srt decreases with increasing @xmath3 . from this point of view",

    "let s look at @xmath95 at @xmath131  k for @xmath92  @xmath93 in fig .",
    "one can see that in the case of @xmath132  nm , the lowest two subbands have an anticrossing and @xmath95 is very close to the anticrossing point . from our calculation , we find that all of the spin mixing , including the hh - lh mixing , the mixing between the lh up states and the lh down states , and the mixing between the hh up states and the hh down states , reaches a maximum because of the anticrossing . as a result , this anticrossing point leads to a strong spin - flip scattering and accounts for the minimum of srt in fig .",
    "3(a ) at @xmath133  k as expected .",
    "when @xmath3 keeps on increasing , @xmath95 will move into the larger-@xmath27 region and the anticrossing point will disappear gradually as shown in fig .  2 , and the energy gap between the lowest two helix subbands at the fermi surface gets larger .",
    "therefore , the spin mixing at the fermi surface becomes smaller , and the srt will slightly increase with @xmath3 .",
    "however , when @xmath134  nm , the effect of reducing the energy gap between the lowest two subbands and increasing the spin mixing are more important and the srt decreases with @xmath3 again .",
    "we also plot the srt as a function of @xmath3 at @xmath135  k and @xmath136  k in fig .",
    "one finds that the srt decreases with temperature .",
    "this could be understood as follows : firstly , when the temperature increases , holes are populating the higher-@xmath27 states , for which all of the spin mixings in the @xmath83 and @xmath78 subbands are stronger ; secondly , the strength of total scattering is enhanced .",
    "both effects increase the contribution of spin - flip scattering and speed up the spin relaxation .",

    "5(a ) we plot the srt as a function of @xmath111 at various temperatures and @xmath140  nm . from the figure one can see that , when @xmath141  k , the srt first increases then decreases with @xmath111 . to understand this behavior ,",
    "let s look at the energy spectrum for @xmath140  nm shown in fig .",
    "5(c ) . the dashed line in fig .",
    "5(c ) represents @xmath95 for @xmath142  @xmath93 at @xmath102  k. one can see that the energy gap between @xmath83 and @xmath78 is large because of the small qwr size .",
    "when the temperature is low , @xmath95 only intersects with the @xmath83 subbands and is far away from the @xmath78 subbands .",
    "therefore , holes populate the @xmath83 subbands only .",
    "the main spin relaxation mechanism is from the spin - flip scattering , i.e. , the scattering between @xmath83 subbands .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that the @xmath78 subbands have a maximum at the wavenumber where the @xmath83 subbands intersect with @xmath95 for @xmath143  @xmath93 at @xmath102  k. in the region where @xmath27 is smaller than the intersection point of @xmath144 and the @xmath83 subbands , the energy gap between @xmath83 and @xmath78 subbands increases , and our calculation shows that the spin mixing of the @xmath83 states decreases .",
    "therefore , when @xmath102  k and @xmath145  @xmath93 , the spin mixing at the fermi surface decreases with increase of @xmath111 , and the srt increases with @xmath111 because of the decrease of the spin - flip scattering . in the region where @xmath27 is larger than the intersection point",
    ", the energy gap between @xmath83 and @xmath78 subbands decreases , and the spin mixing of the @xmath83 states increases . as a result ,",
    "the srt increases with @xmath111 when @xmath146  @xmath93 .",
    "the case of @xmath147  k is similar to that of @xmath102  k , but the holes are distributed in a wider @xmath27 region and reach the maximum of the @xmath78 subbands at a smaller @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the srt begins to decrease at @xmath148  @xmath93 .",
    "one can further see that the srt for @xmath102  k is smaller than that for @xmath147  k at small @xmath111 but larger than it at large @xmath111 .",
    "this can be easily understood as when the fermi wavevector is smaller than the wavevector where the maximum of the @xmath78 subbands occurs , the spin mixing decreases with @xmath149 and the srt increases with @xmath149 .",
    "otherwise , the srt decreases with @xmath149 .",
    "we also plot the srt as a function of @xmath111 at @xmath135  k and @xmath136  k in fig .",
    "one finds that the srt decreases with @xmath111 .",
    "this can be understood as follows : firstly , holes are populated at high-@xmath27 states that are larger than the wavevector where the maximum of the @xmath78 subbands occurs , and the spin mixing increases with @xmath111 ; secondly , due to the larger temperature , the holes are also distributed in @xmath78 states .",
    "therefore , the spin - flip scattering includes not only the scattering between @xmath83 subbands , but also the inter - subband spin - flip scattering , i.e. , the spin - flip scattering between @xmath83 and @xmath78 subbands .",
    "the strength of this inter - subband spin - flip scattering is enhanced with the increase of @xmath111 because of the increase of the hole population in @xmath78 states .",
    "both effects increase the contribution of spin - flip scattering and boost the spin relaxation .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) are quite different compared with those of lhs in quantum wells with small well width where the srt decreases monotonically with @xmath111 at low temperature but increases with @xmath111 at high temperature.@xcite the difference originates from the fact that the energy spectrum of the qwr is modulated dramatically by the qwr size , and one can modulate the spin mixing strength by changing the region where holes are distributed . in order to better show this modulation , we also plot the results of @xmath132  nm in fig .",
    "in this situation the energy gap between the lowest two subbands gets smaller as shown in fig.2(c ) , and consequently both the spin mixing and the strength of the inter - subband spin - flip scattering increase with @xmath111 like the case of @xmath150  k in fig .",
    "therefore , the srt decreases with @xmath111 as expected .",

    "we also plot the hole distribution of the @xmath78 subbands .",
    "note the scale of the distribution is on the right side of the figure.,width=340 ]    to see more detail of how the temperature affects the spin relaxation , we plot in fig .",

    "when @xmath100 m@xmath155 , the srt first increases then decreases with @xmath149 for the reason mentioned in the paragraph above .",
    "when @xmath125 m@xmath155 , one can see a fast decrease of the srt around @xmath157  k. to understand this behavior , we plot the hole distribution in the @xmath78 subbands in fig .  6 , from which one can see a fast increase of population in the @xmath78 subbands around @xmath157k , as the energy scale of the gap between the @xmath83 and @xmath78 subbands is close to @xmath158 of @xmath157  k. this fast increase of the hole occupation in the @xmath78 subbands leads to an increase of inter - subband spin - flip scattering which accounts for the fast decrease of the srt around @xmath157  k. to further reveal the contribution of inter - subband scattering , we plot the results which exclude the inter - subband hole - phonon scattering and inter - subband hole - hole scattering as dashed curves in fig .",
    "one finds that the fast decrease of the srt around @xmath157  k disappears .",
    "we also plot the results without the coherent term but including all the scattering as the chain curve .",
    "one can see that when @xmath159  k and the holes are populated at the @xmath83 subbands only , the chain curve coincides with the solid curve for that the coherent term only includes @xmath119 which is negligible . when @xmath160  k and holes populate both the @xmath83 and @xmath78 subbands , there is difference between the chain curve and the solid curve which is due to the inhomogeneous broadening in the coherent term @xmath121 .",
    "this inhomogeneous broadening , together with the inter - subband scattering , can cause spin relaxation as discussed in subsection a. however , the difference between the chain and the solid curves is small .",
    "this indicates that the contribution of this spin relaxation mechanism is not as important as the contribution from the spin - flip scattering .       at different qwr sizes and initial spin polarizations .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) curves are the results obtained for an initial spin polarization @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "@xmath163 : @xmath140  nm ; @xmath154 : @xmath132  nm . @xmath138  k.,width=340 ]    finally , we investigate the initial spin polarization dependence of the spin relaxation . in fig .",
    "7 we plot the srt as a function of hole density for both low and high spin polarizations with different qwr sizes at @xmath138  k. it can be seen from the figure that the srt of the case with high spin polarization is larger .",
    "this originates from the hartree - fock contribution of the hole - hole coulomb interaction , which serves as an effective magnetic field and can effectively reduce the spin relaxation at large spin polarization.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the spin relaxation of holes in @xmath0-type gaas qwrs .",
    "the srt is calculated by numerically solving the fully microscopic kinetic spin bloch equations in the helix spin space .",
    "differing from our previous works in @xmath164-type quantum - well and qwr systems@xcite where the soc is weak and the collinear statistics is good enough , the helix statistics is adopted in this investigation because of the strong soc for holes in qwr system . using this approach ,",
    "we have studied in detail how the hole spin relaxation is affected by the wire size , the hole densities , temperature and the spin polarization .",
    "the confinement potential is assumed to be rectangular hard wall potential with infinite - depth throughout the paper . in real sample",
    ", the srt can be quantitatively different from our results due to the different confinements .",
    "however , the leading features such as the strong hh - lh mixing and the anticrossing points will be retained,@xcite and the qualitative results will remain unchanged accordingly .    we show that when holes are populated at the lowest helix subbands @xmath83 only , the main spin - relaxation mechanism is the spin - flip scattering which is proportional to the spin mixing of the helix subbands . when holes are populated in both @xmath83 and @xmath78 subbands , there are three mechanisms leading to spin relaxation : first , the bare spin - flip scattering ; second , the spin - conserving scattering along with the inhomogeneous broadening ; and third , the spin - flip scattering along with the inhomogeneous broadening . however , the bare spin - flip scattering is still the dominant spin relaxation mechanism .",
    "the qwr size influences the srt effectively because the spin mixing and the subband structure in qwrs depend strongly on the confinement .",
    "when the wire width gets larger , the subbands are closer to each other and the spin mixing of the subbands gets larger , therefore , the srt decreases . especially , in the case of @xmath82  nm , there is an anticrossing point .",
    "if the fermi surface happens to be close to this point , this anticrossing point leads to a strong spin - flip scattering which accounts for a minimum of the srt .",
    "when @xmath88  nm , @xmath89  nm , the anticrossing point at small @xmath27 between the @xmath83 and @xmath78 disappears .",
    "however , at large @xmath27 , the lowest two subbands become very close to each other .",
    "if we take the hole density to be @xmath123  @xmath93 to place the fermi surface at this large @xmath27 region , the srt is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the srt at small wire width because the spin mixing here is very large and the contribution from the spin - flip scattering is very strong .",
    "the hole density influences the srt by modulating the strength of spin mixing and the strength of inter - subband spin - flip scattering . in most of the cases we considered , the strength of spin mixing and the inter - subband scattering increase with @xmath111 as the holes are populated in high @xmath27 states . as a result ,",
    "the srt decreases with @xmath111 .",
    "however , when the confinement is very strong and the energy gap between @xmath83 and @xmath78 is large , there is a small region where the spin mixing decreases with @xmath27 .",
    "if we choose a small @xmath111 and a low temperature to make the holes be distributed in this small region only , one finds that the srt increases with @xmath111 because of the decreasing spin mixing .",
    "the influence of temperature on the srt is similar to the case of the hole density dependence .",
    "the strength of both the spin mixing and the spin - flip scattering increases with @xmath149 , and the srt decreases with @xmath149 .",
    "especially , when the energy scale of the gap between the @xmath83 and @xmath78 subbands is close to @xmath158 , there is a fast increase of the distribution on the @xmath78 subbands , which leads to an increase of inter - subband spin - flip scattering and leads to a fast decrease of the srt .",
    "this decrease of the srt also proves that the inter - subband spin - flip scattering makes a marked contribution to the spin relaxation .",
    "we further show that the hartree - fock term increases with spin polarization and can reduce the spin relaxation .",
