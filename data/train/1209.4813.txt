    "bepc was a single - ring @xmath1 collider that operated in the @xmath5-charm threshold energy region between 2.0  and  5.0  gev with a luminosity of @xmath16@xmath17s@xmath18 . among the early successes included a precise measurement of the mass of the @xmath5 lepton  @xcite that not only improved on the precision of previous measurements by an order - of - magnitude , but also showed that the existing world avearge value was high by about two standard deviations . in the late 1990s , the bes detector was upgraded to the besii detector and this produced another key result that was the precise measurement of the total cross section for @xmath1 annihilation into hadrons ( @xmath6 value ) over the accessible center of mass ( c.m . ) energy range  @xcite .",
    "the precision of these measurements lead to a substantially improved evaulation of the electromagnetic coupling constant extrapolated to the @xmath19-boson mass peak , @xmath20 , which resulted in a significant @xmath2130% increase in the standard model ( sm ) predicted value for the higgs boson mass  @xcite .",
    "besii also discovered a number of new hadron states , including the @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath23  @xcite scalar resonances and a still - unexplained subthreshold @xmath24 resonance produced in radiative @xmath25 decays  @xcite .    between 2005 and 2008 ,",
    "bepc was replaced by bepcii , a two - ring @xmath1 collider with a hundred - fold increase in luminosity , and the besii detector was completely removed and replaced by besiii , a state - of - the - art detector built around a 1  t superconducting solenoid that contains a cylindrical drift chamber , a double - layer barrel of scintillation counters for time - of - flight measurements , and a nearly @xmath26 array of 6240 csi(tl ) crystals for electromagnetic calorimetry .",

    "bepcii operations started in summer 2008 and since then the luminosity has been continuously improving ; now it is @xmath27@xmath17s@xmath18 , quite near the @xmath28 design value .",
    "the besiii detector performance is excellent : the charged particle momentum resolution is @xmath29% ; the @xmath30 energy resolution is 2.5% at @xmath31  gev ; the 6% resolution @xmath32 measurements in the drift chamber plus the @xmath2180  ps resolution time - of - flight measurements is sufficient to identify charged particles over the entire momentum range of interest .",
