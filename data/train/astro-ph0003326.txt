    "the interest in supernovae has risen dramatically with their application to cosmological problems .",
    "their unique capabilities as distance indicators on the cosmic scale have pushed them into the limelight of cosmology .",
    "these objects , however , are interesting and exciting in their own right .",
    "supernova physics relates some of the most complicated physical processes from the explosion mechanisms to nucleosynthesis , radiation transport , and shock physics as well as some of the most intriguing astrophysics ranging from star formation and stellar evolution to cosmic metal enrichment , evolution of galaxies , and the scale and fate of the universe .",
    "their brightness makes them ideal _ stellar _ tracers at large distances and look back times . solving some of the supernova specific problems will hence give us clues on a much larger scale .",
    "stellar explosions have been observed for many centuries .",
    "nonetheless , supernovae are extremely rare and only six of them have been observed over the last millennium in our own galaxy ( clark & stevenson 1977 , murdin & murdin 1985 , van den bergh & tammann 1991 ) .",
    "the number of extragalactic supernova detections has grown continuously .",
    "originally only searched by a few limited experiments ( e.g. zwicky 1965 ) with about a dozen sne detected each year , the topic has taken a big turn with sn  1987a and the emergence of deep coordinated searches for distant supernovae in the last decade .",

    "it has allowed us to conduct detailed studies of specific supernova classes and find the commonalities as well as the individuality among supernovae .",
    "the surge of data has further provided many new constraints for the models .",
    "it has become increasingly clear that two main classes of supernovae ( type  ia _ vs. _ type  ii and type  ib / c ) with physically completely different backgrounds exist .",
    "originally an observational separation according to spectral features ( minkowski 1941 , 1964 , harkness & wheeler 1990 , filippenko 1997a ) the classification scheme has proven to identify physically distinct objects . on the other hand ,",
    "the classification system has not turned out to be sufficient .",
    "several objects defy a clear classification and have forced extensions to the system .",
    "there is , however , a move to a more physical description of individual objects . especially bright , well - observed ,",
    "events have increased our understanding of the explosions .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are now almost universally accepted as thermonuclear explosions in low - mass stars ( trimble 1982 , 1983 , woosley & weaver 1986 ) .",
    "all other known supernova explosions are thought to be due to the core collapse in massive stars .",
    "there are many reviews on ( type ia ) supernovae available .",
    "the most comprehensive books are petschek ( 1990 ) , wheeler , piran , & weinberg ( 1990 ) , woosley ( 1991 ) , mccray & wang ( 1996 ) , bludman et al .",

    "supernovae are classified by their spectrum near maximum light ( see filippenko 1997a for a review on supernova classifications ) .",
    "the type ia supernovae are characterized by the complete absence of hydrogen and helium lines and a distinct , strong absorption line near 6100 , which comes from a doublet of singly ionized silicon with @xmath06347  and 6371 .",
    "hydrogen or helium lines never appear in the spectra of sne  ia at any phase of the evolution .",
    "significant variations have been observed within this scheme , but in general sne  ia can safely be distinguished from any other supernovae ( filippenko 1997a ) .",
    "great care has to be taken to separate the sn  ia from sne  ib / c which can display a similar spectrum at early phases .",
    "secondary classification criteria are the late - phase spectrum dominated by forbidden iron and cobalt lines , light curve shape , color evolution , and host galaxy morphology .",
    "none of these is sufficient by itself , but may provide additional evidence for a classification .",
    "since sne  ia are possibly the main producer of iron in the universe , they provide a clock for the metal enrichment of matter .",
    "the relative long progenitor life times , as compared to massive stars which become core - collapse supernovae , provides a convenient feature in the relative metal abundances of @xmath1elements and iron - group elements ( renzini 1999 ) .",
    "the heating of the interstellar medium , in particular for elliptical galaxies , depends on the sn  ia rates and their energy input ( ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ) .    as explosions of white dwarfs",
    "sne  ia are placed at the end of one of the major stellar evolution channels .",
    "although only a few white dwarfs really explode as sne  ia , they still can provide important information on the binary fraction of stars and the evolution of binary systems both in our galaxy ( e.g. iben & tutukov 1994 , 1999 ) and as a function of look back time ( yungelson & livio 1998 , ruiz - lapuente & canal 1998 ) .",
    "supernovae also play an important feedback role during the early galaxy evolution and might be responsible for substantial loss of material from galaxies ( e.g. wyse & silk 1985 , burkert & ruiz - lapuente 1997 , ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ) and the regulation of the star formation process .",
    "the contribution of sne  ia as opposed to core - collapse supernovae from massive stars is , however , unclear .",
    "recent years have seen sne  ia taking center stage in observational cosmology .",
    "as the momentarily best distance indicator beyond the virgo cluster , they provide the main route to the current expansion rate ( branch 1998 ) and the deceleration of the universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998a , perlmutter et al .",
    "almost all hubble constant determinations are now involving sne  ia in one form or another .",
    "two large hst programs have adopted sne  ia as their prime distance indicator beyond the reach of cepheid stars ( saha et al .",
    "1999 , gibson et al .",
    "2000 , mould et al .",
    "although other secondary distance indicators are still discussed , in most approaches they enter the analyses with lower weight ( mould et al .",
    "it is also gratifying to see that a general convergence of the value of h@xmath2 to within the respective error bars between 60 and 70 km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 has been reached .",
    "the claim , based on sne  ia , for an accelerated universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998a , perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) has triggered an enthralling debate in cosmology .",
    "it will be an important next step to verify that supernova evolution is not mimicking a signal which has been interpreted as a cosmological constant .",
    "other explanations of the supernova result apart from a cosmological constant and based on decaying particle fields have been proposed as well ( for a recent review see kamionkowski & kosowsky 1999 ) .",
    "type ia supernovae are characterized by the absence of hydrogen and helium and the presence of processed material , mostly calcium , silicon and sulphur , in their spectra during the peak phase . at late phases",
    "the spectrum is dominated by emission lines of iron - group elements .",
    "sne  ia further exhibit a distinct light curve shape , extreme luminosity , absence of any appreciable amount of circumstellar material , and a lack of detectable polarization .",

    "collaborative efforts are undertaken by the international supernova network , the variable star network ( vsnet ) , and through the astronomy section of the rochester academy of sciences .",

    "the combination of observations from all sources has played an important role in some of the recent research projects ( e.g. riess et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "the frequency of supernovae carries important information about their parent population and the physical process which drives the explosions .",
    "although the relative importance of this measurement has been recognized , it has been very difficult to derive good numbers for the supernova rates ( for reviews see van den bergh & tammann 1991 , tammann 1994 , strom 1995 ) .",
    "the main problem is the extreme rarity of supernovae which makes statistically significant samples very difficult to come by .",
    "the problem worsens when the rates are split into many supernova and galaxy subtypes leaving very few objects per sampling bin .",
    "the searches have further to consider the time for which supernovae could have been discovered .",
    "the control time is an important parameter which is typically difficult to calculate as it depends on light curve shape , absolute luminosity , and the absorption by dust in the local supernova environment ( tammann 1994 , strom 1995 ) .",
    "supernova rates are normally expressed as the number of supernovae per century per blue unit ( i.e. solar ) luminosity ( typically per @xmath6l@xmath7 ) .",
    "the latter reflects the belief that supernovae are linked to the stellar population which dominates the galaxy light .",
    "the attempt to measure the sn  ia rate per _ h _ luminosity , which traces older stellar populations , seems more reasonable ( van den bergh 1990 ) , if we believe that sne  ia come from long - lived progenitor systems .",
    "unfortunately , there are no good _ h _ luminosities available for large samples of galaxies . since the total luminosity depends on the galaxy distances the supernova rates depend on @xmath8 .",
    "two complementary efforts can be distinguished .",
    "one approach is to collect as many supernovae as possible and then define the galaxy sample from which they emerged ( tammann et al .",
    "this is hampered by the fact that galaxies without supernova enter the sample only according to some selection criteria ( e.g. contained in a given volume ) .",
    "the other approach is to only include supernovae which have been detected in a pre - defined galaxy sample ( cappellaro et al .",
    "this restricts the number of supernovae significantly .",
    "a new approach , which is tailored for more distant searches , is to define a galaxy luminosity function and use this information ( as a function of redshift ) to determine the rates ( pain et al .",
    "1996 , reiss 1999 ) .",
    "this may be the most efficient way to treat this problem avoiding massive redshift surveys which cover all galaxies accessible in the search area and may well require prohibitive amounts of observing time .",
    "other problems affecting sn rates are the internal extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "this extinction depends on the local environment and may differ considerably for the various supernova types .",
    "the extinction of course depends on the parent population of the supernovae .",
    "sne  ia presumably originate in an older population where extinction should be less of a problem ( but see below and section [ sec : diff ] for doubts on the universality of this assumption ) .",
    "unless the age and initial mass function of the supernova parent population is the same as that of the dominant stellar population , the assumption that the _ b _ luminosity may be a good comparison is questionable .",
    "the rates of sne  ia are very low with about 1 event every 500 to 600 years for a galaxy with @xmath6l@xmath7 and a hubble constant of 65  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1997 , reiss 1999 ) .",
    "there is a dependence on galaxy type which shows that sne  ia are observed less often in early type ( elliptical and s0 ) galaxies than in spirals .",
    "this goes against the claim that they emerge from very old stellar populations .",
    "a further puzzling fact questioning the old paradigm is that there seems to be some preference of sne  ia in star forming galaxies to lie in or near spiral arms ( bartunov et al .",
    "1996 ) or at least in their vicinity ( mcmillan & ciardullo 1996 ) which would make them of intermediate age ( @xmath90.5 gyr ) .",
    "the rate in the field and in galaxy clusters seems to vary very little ( reiss 1999 ) .",
    "the rates of distant ( @xmath10 ) supernovae have been derived only for two very small samples ( pain et al .",
    "1996 , reiss 1999 ) .",
    "for the distant supernovae the difficulties in calculating rates are exacerbated by the small number statistics of spectroscopically classified objects .",
    "an additional factor for the distant searches are the exact galaxy luminosities and an approach over some general luminosity functions is required ( reiss 1999 ) .",
    "the restriction to a given filter passband ( mostly the _ b _ band ) becomes questionable as there are significant color changes for distant galaxies .",
    "it is hence not too surprising that the two estimates are not concordant .",
    "larger supernova samples at high redshift have already been observed and new rates will become available soon .",
    "light curves form one of the main information sources for all supernovae .",
    "typically they are observed in the broad - band optical filters following the bessell ( 1990 ) system , which combines the older johnson ( johnson & harris 1954 ) and cousins ( 1980 , 1981 ) filter passbands .",

    "observers usually use the _ b _ maximum as the zero - point for the light curves .",
    "we will follow this practice here as well .",
    "the light curves have been investigated in detail over the last decade .",
    "after the early assumption of a single time evolution ( minkowski 1964 , leibundgut 1988 , leibundgut et al .",
    "1991a ) clear differences emerged when new objects were observed in more detail .",
    "a striking example of the differences has been demonstrated by suntzeff ( 1996 ) with the _ r _ and _ i _ light curves .",
    "earlier indications of deviant objects had been ignored ( phillips et al .",
    "1987 , frogel et al .",

    "excellent reviews of this topic are available ( branch et al . 1995 , renzini 1996 , livio 1999 , nomoto 1999 ) and we refer the reader to the references in these compilations .    the observations of sne  ia",
    "tell us that they emerge from a compact object as is inferred from the light curves , i.e. the short duration of the peak phase . the fast decline and the large leakage of @xmath24rays , although only measured indirectly , imply a small mass of the ejecta as well .",
    "note that this statement implicitly made use of the thermonuclear explosion models ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : theo ] ) . the glaring absence of the most abundant elements in the universe , hydrogen and helium , narrow the selection down to a few highly evolved objects .",
    "also the appearance in elliptical galaxies with their old stellar population hints at significant nuclear processing before explosion .",
    "indirectly these observational results indicate that sne  ia do not emerge from single star systems .",
    "the absence of hydrogen and helium must mean that the star has removed its envelope .",
    "the longevity of the progenitors , at least for sne  ia in elliptical galaxies , and the trigger of the explosion also point to binary systems .    an important piece of information is the rarefied environment in which sne  ia explode .",
    "radio emission is the telltale signature of such circumstellar material , but has not been detected in a single sn  ia .",
    "this also sets limits on mass - loss from companion stars .",
    "a potentially powerful analysis tool would be the detection of narrow h@xmath57 or he emission from gas shed by the companion star .",
    "the best observations to test for such emission have been obtained for sn  1994d without a detection ( cumming et al .",
    "the investigation of local interstellar environments of sne  ia has so far been inconclusive ( van dyk et al .",
    "1999 ) , but there are at least four cases which could lie close or within an area of active star formation .    the rareness of sne  ia is a further indicator of a special stellar evolution scenario leading to these explosions . with so few stars producing sne  ia the selection criterion must be rather severe .    the uniform appearance is often used as an argument for a restrictive progenitor base , but in the light of the recent observations , in particular of the faint objects sn  1991bg and sn  1997cn , this should be investigated again carefully . on the other hand , the strong correlations hint at fairly unique progenitor systems allowing for some variations .",
    "most discussions on sn  ia progenitors try to answer two questions . at what mass does the white dwarf explode ( chandrasekhar or sub - chandrasekhar ) and what is the donor star .",
    "the first question should be answerable with exact determinations of the ni masses ( see   [ sec : ni - mass ] ) and the combination of this energy source with the ejecta energy which can be measured from late - phase line widths ( e.g. mazzali et al .",
    "1998 ) . with the velocities and the column density to @xmath24rays it should be possible to estimate a total ejecta mass .",
    "so far , we have not been able to derive reliable ejecta masses at all .",
    "the binary companion to the white dwarf could be either another white dwarf ( double - degenerate ) , in which case the two would merge due to orbital energy loss by gravitational radiation , or a regular live star which could be either in its giant or main - sequence phase ( renzini 1996 ) . in the second case that star transfers either hydrogen or helium to the white dwarf which burns the material in a steady phase at its surface .",
    "such systems are well known as cataclysmic variables and novae ( in the case of a main - sequence companion ) or symbiotic stars ( where the companion is a red giant ) .",
    "supersoft x - ray sources have been identified as white dwarfs with steady burning hydrogen shells ( see kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 for a recent review ) .",
    "their potential as progenitors of sne  ia depends on the effectiveness with which the white dwarf can increase its mass towards the chandrasekhar mass ( hachisu et al .",
    "1999a , b ) or whether sub - chandrasekhar explosions are possible ( renzini 1996 ) .",
    "whether sne  ia in elliptical galaxies can be explained by such systems is controversial .",
    "the critical parameter is the mass of the companion star . to reach ages of @xmath2310@xmath5810@xmath59  years",
    "the companion can not be more than 0.9 to 1.0  m@xmath60 ( hachisu et al .",
    "for compact binary supersoft sources the companion mass has to be larger than 1.2  m@xmath60 which would make them too short - lived for progenitors in elliptical galaxies ( kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 ) .",
    "the double degenerate progenitor models have rebounded in recent years with the detections of several systems with a life time short enough ( maxted & marsh 1999 ) .",
    "one system with a total mass near the chandrasekhar limit has been found ( koen et al . 1998 ) .",
    "earlier searches for such binaries had been unsuccessful ( e.g. bragaglia et al .",
    "1990 , renzini 1996 ) .",
    "there are several questions connected to such progenitor scenarios as well .",
    "especially the evolutionary path through two common - envelope phases is still very uncertain .",
    "detailed calculations on the final merger are also so far inconclusive and in some cases a collapse to a neutron star is favored ( saio & nomoto 1998 , livio 1999 ) .",
    "another outcome of such mergers would be super - chandrasekhar explosions .",
    "it has been claimed that sn  1991 t with its large ni mass could be explained this way ( fisher et al . 1999 ) .",
    "another possible way to investigate progenitor systems is to determine the supernova rate as a function of redshift ( ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "1995a , madau et al .",
    "1998 , yungelson & livio 1998 , ruiz - lapuente & canal 1998 , dahln & fransson 1999 ) . the average age of the underlying stellar population will influence the number of progenitor systems available at any given epoch .",
    "it is obvious that these rates also depend on the cosmological model , the star formation history , and other observational effects , like dust obscuration ( yungelson & livio 1999 ) or inhibition of supernova explosions ( kobayashi et al . 1998 ) .",
    "there are no indications of changes of the sn  ia rate out to redshifts of 0.5 reported ( reiss 1999 ) , but the data sets are still very limited .    note , however , that we do not have to peer deep into the universe to determine differences in sn rates from different progenitor populations .",
    "the age differences can be worked out in the local neighborhood by comparing the rates in galaxies of different morphological types .",
    "such a prediction from the evolutionary models would be very helpful to explain the comparatively large rate in spiral galaxies ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "of course , any difference between sne  ia at large look back times and in the local neighborhood would indicate differences in the progenitors .",
    "no large differences have been detected so far ( cf . section  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "recent discussions on changes in rise times ( riess et al .",
    "1999c , aldering et al .",
    "2000 ) and possible color evolutions will have to be followed closely in this respect .    without clearer indications from observations",
    "the progenitor question will remain unanswered .",
    "searches will have to concentrate on left overs in any of the progenitor scenarios . in the case of the hydrogen transfer from the companion a thin layer of hydrogen",
    "should still be on the surface of the explosion or in the wind of the companion .",
    "it could possibly be observed as a narrow line .",
    "the double - degenerate case would produce a significant mass range and possibly also asymmetric explosions depending on the accretion of the companion .",
    "once we are in the situation where we can measure the amount of nickel produced in the explosion , we will probe the explosion mechanisms more directly .",
    "since most of the white dwarf is burned to the radioactive @xmath50ni and we are observing the subsequent energy release , we are probing the most sensitive part of the explosion .",
    "observationally the measurement of the nickel mass has become possible recently with the advent of larger telescopes and the development of better radiation diagnostics .",
    "there are two main routes to nickel masses in sne  ia .",
    "one is through the observations of the ashes , i.e. the left over iron from the decays , in the near - infrared and the other by obtaining the total luminosity at peak and the application of ",
    "arnett s law  ( arnett 1982 , arnett et al .",
    "1985 , branch 1992 ) , which states that the energy released on the surface at maximum light is equal to the energy injected by nuclear decays at the bottom of the ejecta .",
    "the reason for this is that the atmosphere is turning optically thin ( pinto & eastman 2000 ) .",
    "it is possible that arnett s law is not exact and the ratio of energy release and input is not exactly unity , e.g. due to asymmetries or multi - dimensional effects .",
    "however , is has to be expected that all supernovae show a fairly uniform behaviour and the systematic differences are likely to be small compared with the uncertainties which arise from extinction and the lack of accurate distances .",
    "the bolometric luminosity has been determined only for very few objects ( vacca & leibundgut 1996 , turatto et al .",
    "1996 , contardo et al .",
    "since the total luminosity observed at maximum equals the instantaneous radioactive decay energy one simply calculates the amount of nickel and its daughter product , cobalt , at this moment . the time between explosion and maximum is an input parameter in this calculation ,",
    "although it does not introduce severe uncertainties ( contardo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the assumed distances and reddening are the critical parameters in all these analyses . they are needed for the conversion of the observed flux to absolute units .",
    "we have listed in table  [ tab : ni - mass ] the nickel masses as derived by contardo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "a third possibility is to calculate an exact energy conversion from the decays and compare this against the observed late light curves .",
    "the latter approach is complicated by the dependence on the exact models and carries large uncertainties due to partially unknown influences from the positron channel in the decay ( axelrod 1980 , cappellaro et al .",
    "1998 , milne et al . 1999 ) .",
    "nickel masses have been derived mostly through the near - infrared observations of [ fe  ii ] and [ co  ii ] lines ( spyromilio et al .",
    "1992 , bowers et al .",
    "these lines have the advantage that they are largely single transitions of low excitation stages and not blended , which is not the case in optical spectra ( axelrod 1980 , kuchner et al .",
    "1994 , mazzali et al .",
    "the low ionization is a further advantage as the atomic data are more reliable than for the higher ionization lines .",
    "critical for this method is the accuracy with which the collision strengths of the lines are known .",
    "the uncertainties , especially for the [ co  ii ] and [ co  iii ] lines , are still substantial .",
    ".absolute _ b _ magnitudes and bolometric luminosities .",
    "the nickel mass is derived from the luminosity for a rise time of 17 days to the bolometric peak .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : ni - mass ]    the determinations of the nickel masses are fairly consistent between the different approaches ( contardo et al",
    "the major uncertainties are the distances to the supernovae , which directly influences the luminosities , both for the lines as well as the bolometric flux .",
    "the detailed theoretical understanding of type ia supernovae is still limited .",
    "two very complicated physical processes are at work in sne  ia explosions .",
    "first there is the explosion mechanism itself , which is still debated and several possibilities are proposed and then there is the complicated , highly non - thermal process of the radiation escape which leads to the observed phenomenon . a recent review of sn  ia theory is presented by hillebrandt & niemeyer ( 2000 ) .",
    "in general it is agreed that sne  ia are the result of thermonuclear explosions in compact stars .",
    "white dwarfs are favored by their intrinsic instability at the chandrasekhar mass and the fuel they provide in carbon and oxygen .",
    "all the arguments for this scenario have been already clearly laid out before 1986 ( woosley & weaver 1986 and references therein ) .",
    "other fuels could be imagined , but all of them have some problems .",
    "they either do not provide enough ( explosive ) energy ( like hydrogen ) or can not synthesize the intermediate - mass elements ( like helium , which detonates ) .",
    "higher elements are in principle possible , but it is well known that o - ne - mg white dwarfs would rather collapse to a neutron star than explode because of the large electron capture effects ( e.g. nomoto & kondo 1991 , gutirrez et al .",
    "1996 ) . the initiation of the burning in the degenerate star is , however , a puzzle .",
    "for many years it was clear that a detonation ( supersonic burning front ) would lead to an overabundance of iron - group elements and not enough of the intermediate - mass elements observed in the spectral evolution during the peak phase .",
    "a deflagration ( subsonic burning ) seemed more appropriate , but it was not clear how to prevent the explosions to turn into a detonation .",
    "the phenomenological model w7 ( nomoto et al . 1984 , thielemann et al . 1986 ) or similar explosions ( woosley & weaver 1986 , 1994b ) enjoy a great popularity as the explosive input model for spectral calculations since they seemed to reproduce the element distribution fairly accurately ( e.g. harkness 1991 , jeffery et al .",
    "1992 , mazzali et al .",
    "1993 , 1995 , 1997 , yamaoka et al .",
    "1992 , shigeyama et al .",
    "the burning speed in this model has , however , never been understood in physical terms .",
    "possible alternatives are the pre - expansion of the white dwarf to lift the degeneracy by a slow deflagration first and have the detonation start later ( khokhlov 1991 ) .",
    "the critical parameters in these models are the density at the transition from deflagration to detonation , the pre - explosion density , the chemical composition ( mostly c / o ratio ) , and the deflagration speed at the beginning of the burning .",
    "the transition density has been proposed as the critical parameter for the nucleosynthesis and hence the amount of ni produced in the explosion .",
    "these delayed - detonation models can reproduce some of the observations ( hflich 1995 , hflich & khokhlov 1996 , hflich et al .",
    "however , their consistency has been questioned recently ( niemeyer 1999 , lisewski et al .",
    "1999a , b ) .",
    "another possibility is that the first explosion in the center fizzles and as the star contracts again , the density and temperatures rise high enough to re - ignite carbon near the center and lead to the explosion ( arnett & livne 1994a , b , hflich et al . 1995 ) .",
    "there are hence several theoretical possibilities to ignite the white dwarf , but it is still not clear which ones are realized in nature . with the variety of sn  ia events observed now , it is possible that sne  ia come from different burning processes",
    ". however , the observed correlations must then be valid across different explosion mechanisms .",
    "once the explosion has started , the flame has to continue burning enough material to unbind the star .",
    "in many calculations this has not occurred and the flame has fizzled .",
    "only recently have some three - dimensional calculations led to weak explosions ( khokhlov 1995 , niemeyer et al .",
    "1996 , reineke et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "an altogether different explosion mechanism on sub - chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs has been explored ( nomoto 1982 , livne 1990 , livne & glasner 1991 , woosley & weaver 1994a , livne & arnett 1995 ) . in this model ,",
    "the explosion is generated at the surface of the white dwarf due to a detonation of he at the bottom of the accretion layer .",
    "this model solved the progenitor problem by allowing explosions well below the chandrasekhar mass near the peak of the white dwarf mass distribution .",
    "difficulties here are the initiation of the explosion and the subsequent ignition of the whole star by a pressure wave .",
    "many of these calculations are still parametric and the details have to be worked out ( cf .",
    "woosley 1997 ) .",
    "it is customary nowadays to explore several of these explosion models to explain the observations ( e.g. leibundgut & pinto 1992 , hflich et al .",
    "1995 , hflich & khokhlov 1996 , hflich et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "another complicated process stands between the explosion models and the observations .",
    "the release of the photons from the explosion is computationally extremely difficult to follow .",
    "the reasons are the continuous change of the energy deposition and the detailed physics of the conversion of the @xmath24rays injected inside the ejecta from the radioactive decays to the low - energy photons observed .",
    "the opacity changes due to the thinning of the expanding ejecta for the high - energy input , but at the same time the high velocities and the abundance of higher elements with their large number of transitions complicates the calculations ( harkness 1991 , hflich et al .",
    "1993 , eastman 1997 , pinto & eastman 2000 ) . the exact treatment is still debated , but it has become increasingly clear that the old assumption of a thermal input spectrum is not tenable . even though sne  ia display a nearly thermal continuum during their peak phase , they are really dominated by the time - dependent photon distribution .",
    "the clearest demonstrations of this fact are the lack of photons in the _ j_-band ( spyromilio et al .",
    "1994 , meikle 2000 ) which is due to the absence of emission lines in this wavelength region and the occurrence of the maximum in different optical filters , which is reversed for most supernovae , i.e. the near - ir filter curves peak before the optical ones ( contardo et al . 2000 , hernandez et al",
    ". 2000 ) .    due to the large opacities in the ejecta the photon degradation proceeds through several channels ( e.g. lucy 1999 , pinto & eastman 2000 ) . since the uv region is blocked by many velocity - broadened iron - group lines ( harkness 1991 , kirshner et al .",
    "1993 ) , the photons are progressively redshifted until the optical depth is small enough for them to escape .",
    "this occurs first in the near - ir and hence the peak is reached earlier at these wavelengths ( meikle 2000 , contardo et al .",
    "however , only in wavelength regions where plenty of line transitions in the outer layers are available is there any significant flux .",
    "nevertheless , the optical spectrum has been modeled rather successfully even with thermal input sources ( harkness 1991 , jeffery et al .",
    "1992 , mazzali et al .",
    "1993 , 1995 , 1997 , nugent et al .",
    "this is possible since the outer layers already encounter a pseudo - thermal input spectrum ( pinto & eastman 2000 ) .",
    "detailed treatment of the nlte effects has been included by several groups ( baron et al .",
    "1996 , pauldrach et al .",
    "1996 , hflich 1995 , hflich et al .",
    "1996 , lucy 1999 , pinto & eastman 2000 ) .    at late phases",
    "the ejecta are optically thin for optical and infrared photons and we see a spectrum dominated by collisionally excited fe and co lines ( axelrod 1980 , ruiz - lapuente & lucy 1992 , spyromilio et al .",
    "1992 , kuchner et al .",
    "1995 , bowers et al .",
    "1997 , mazzali et al .",
    "1998 ) . at these epochs",
    "it has been assumed that the energy of the positrons in the @xmath50co decay is locally deposited .",
    "this has recently been questioned because of the increased slope of the light curves ( ruiz - lapuente & spruit 1998 , cappellaro et al .",
    "1998 , milne et al . 1999 ) .",
    "after about 450 days a thermal instability develops in the ejecta which rapidly cool down from about 3000  k to 300  k. excitation of optical and near - infrared transitions declines rapidly and the cooling continues by fine - structure lines of fe in the mid- and far - infrared .",
    "this is often referred to as the ir catastrophe .",
    "the predictions are that this would happen after about 500 days ( fransson et al . 1996 ) but it has never been observed so far .",
    "it will take a few more years until these problems can be addressed completely .",
    "a closer link between the observations and the models has been pursued by trying to understand the correlations which have been observed .",
    "the light curve decline has been modeled ( hflich et al . 1996 ) and explained as due to differences in the amount of ni produced in the explosion .",
    "also the color dependence could possibly be explained this way .",
    "other issues like the rise time or the occurrence of the secondary peak in the near - ir remain , however , open .",
    "a possible interpretation of the light curve stretching during the peak phase and for the bolometric light curves links the time scales of the ni decay , the diffusion time ( for a constant opacity ) and the age of the supernova ( arnett 1982 , arnett 1999 ) .    by comparing the kinetic energy",
    "as derived from line widths and the measured ni masses it should be possible to derive global parameters of the explosion .",
    "first such steps have been made by mazzali et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , cappellaro et al . (",
    "1998 ) , and contardo et al .",
    "this alternative route will not replace the detailed modeling of light curves and spectra , but may provide a more direct input for the explosion models .",
    "although we can foresee a time when there will be more sne  ia at redshifts above 0.3 than nearby ones , we will have to learn from the nearby samples with their superior data coverage and quality .",
    "the distant supernovae are still observed rather sparsely and lack the wavelength and spectral coverage we can obtain for local events .",
    "the capabilities for detailed supernova studies have increased continuously over the past decade and detailed spectroscopic and photometric data sets will become available at a rapid rate .",
    "this will allow us to address very specific questions and focus on model predictions .",
    "however , simple model predictions have been lacking so far and the complications in the explosion models and the radiation transport have proven to be veritable road blocks .    with the extensive and homogeneous data sets which have become accessible in the last few years the general discussion of global parameters of sne  ia is possible .",
    "the detailed statistics of luminosity , rise times , decline rates , and spectral line evolutions have made the systematic investigations of supernova energetics , explosive nucleosynthesis , and more detailed inferences on progenitors a possibility .",
    "the increased and coordinated access to telescopes of all sizes has brought the field forward substantially . with the statistics on global supernova parameters",
    "the tedious comparison with explosion models has been supplemented .    in the following an attempt is made to assemble the available information from the observations to point out future directions of sn  ia research .",
    "the differences of the various luminosity corrections and absorption determinations ( see section [ sec : diff ] ) are very disconcerting .",
    "they clearly are not due to evolution , but will likely be traced to technicalities of the fits .",
    "the most obvious culprit is the degeneracy of reddening and intrinsic color of sne  ia , which has to be lifted for a reliable measurement .",
    "the discrepancies apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm15_comp ] and discussed in section  [ sec : diff ] are most likely due to this degeneracy .",
    "the influences on the cosmological conclusions drawn from sne  ia will have to be investigated in much more detail and the discussion has already started ( e.g. drell et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the different corrections also play an important role in the exact determinations of the hubble constant ( suntzeff et al .",
    "1999 , jha et al . 1999 ,",
    ". 1999 , gibson et al . 2000 ) and are responsible for the remaining discrepancies .",
    "despite the technicalities of the light curve fitting the variations among sne  ia are real and have to be explained .",
    "it is very interesting to consider the invariants among sne  ia .",
    "each of them tells a different part of the overall story and should help in piecing it together .    with the brighter sne seemingly rising and declining",
    "more slowly this implies that the energy release is retarded throughout the maximum phase .",
    "the width of the peak phase in the bolometric light curve also correlates with the peak luminosity ( contardo et al .",
    "2000 ) and so does the occurrence of the shoulder ( contardo 2000 ) .",
    "the more luminous objects are so through the whole known evolution , i.e. they are emitting more energy than the fainter supernovae .",
    "it is also striking to see that the very luminous sne  ia show the characteristic si  ii line appear relatively late ( typically only after maximum light ) .",
    "the color at maximum is a measure of the opacities in the ejecta .",
    "since these are dominated mostly by lines and not continuum processes , the colors are not a direct indicator of the temperature in the ejecta ( pinto & eastman 2000 ) .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath19 color is very well defined and depends very little on the light curve shape whereas @xmath21 shows a stronger dependence on the decline parameter ( phillips et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the velocities of the ejecta can be measured from the emission lines several months past the explosion ( mazzali et al .",
    "the fact , that they correlate with the light curve decline is remarkable .",
    "the ejecta velocities derived from the nebular lines are an indicator of the ratio of kinetic energy and total mass . strictly speaking",
    ", this only applies exactly for spherically symmetric explosions , but at the late phases any asymmetry should be damped out .",
    "since the decline correlates with the maximum luminosity and this in turn is connected to the ni mass synthesized in the explosion ( arnett 1982 , arnett et al .",
    "1985 , branch 1992 ) we have a direct connection of the explosion strength and a product of the power source of the supernova emission .",
    "more luminous sne  ia also are more powerful explosions .",
    "the ejecta mass of these powerful explosions must be higher as well , as the slower release of the energy can only be achieved by a larger column density .",
    "this immediately rules out a single mass progenitor system .",
    "the host galaxy morphology and the galaxy color provide information on the star formation of the parent population .",
    "sne  ia in elliptical galaxies are on average less luminous than their counterparts in late spirals ( filippenko 1989 , hamuy et al .",
    "1995 , schmidt et al .",
    "also sne  ia in bluer galaxies seem to be brighter ( branch et al .",
    "all of the most luminous objects ( like sn  1991 t ) occurred in spiral galaxies , and most of them suffer reddening in the host galaxy and are possibly loosely connected to star forming regions or spiral arms ( bartunov et al . 1994 ) .",
    "it thus appears as if the more luminous objects are connected to a younger parent population and the fainter sne  ia come from old progenitor systems .",
    "yet , the correction from the decline rates applies to all sne  ia independent of the host galaxy morphology ( schmidt et al .",
    "thus , although the parent population may be different , most likely due to age differences , most , if not all , sne  ia come from the same type of progenitor system .",
    "it has been proposed that the explosion energy depends on the precursor composition and could be observed from samples which span sufficiently long look back times , i.e. shorter progenitor life times ( hflich et al .",
    "1998b , kobayashi et al .",
    "1998 , umeda et al . 1999 ) .",
    "such experiments will require better and more extended data than are currently available .",
    "the question of what is a normal sn  ia has been raised many times in the last few years ( e.g. branch et al .",
    "selections based on color or spectra have been proposed and used .",
    "to what extent such subclassifications describe physical differences is , however , unclear .",
    "the extreme cases of sn  1991bg and sn  1997cn can not yet be accommodated within the simple schemes proposed .",
    "could it be that they emerge from different mechanisms ?",
    "the answer is still outstanding and we need more objects of this sort to investigate .",
    "the nickel mass of individual supernovae differs by up to factors of several ( section  [ sec : ni - mass ] ) . with such large differences ,",
    "it is clear that the explosions are not as uniform as assumed only a decade ago",
    ". it will be an important task for the next years to determine whether these differences are due to different explosion mechanisms ( e.g. double detonations , deflagrations , etc . ) or are variations of a single mechanism ( e.g. the density at transition from deflagration to detonation ( hflich et al . 1996 ) ) .",
    "the distribution of nickel masses may provide a first indication of what the exact distribution of the explosions is .",
    "it has been claimed that most sne  ia emerge from a fairly narrow range of luminosities ( and hence nickel masses ) , but the numbers are still small .",
    "the distribution of the decline parameters has not yet yielded a clear picture ( e.g. drell et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it is of course also possible that we are observing two or more explosion mechanisms , each with variations on its own .",
    "a single explosion mechanism which produces differences of a factor of 10 as observed in the nickel masses ( table  [ tab : ni - mass ] ) has not been proposed yet .",
    "three major questions about sne  ia will have to be solved : the influence of reddening , the progenitor systems and the explosion mechanism .",
    "observationally , reddening should be the easiest to either measure or avoid .",
    "many interesting questions can be addressed with a statistically significant near - ir sample .",
    "the luminosity corrections are smaller in the _ i _ band ( phillips et al .",
    "1999 ) , at late times the near - ir is the prefered region for the determination of the ni mass ( spyromilio et al .",
    "1992 , bowers et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the near - ir hubble diagram will also provide a reddening free determination of the hubble constant .",
    "the reddening law in external galaxies will be another topic which could be addressed by sne  ia observed in the optical and the near - ir .",
    "signatures of sn  ia progenitors should be discovered soon .",
    "either signs of the companion transfer to the white dwarf are detected or possible progenitor systems can be ruled out on statistical grounds .",
    "neither has so far been the case .",
    "dedicated programs for the search of possible progenitor systems are needed .",
    "the constraints on the progenitor models will have to be increased and improved .",
    "the fact that we do not know whether some sne  ia come from sub - chandrasekhar or chandrasekhar mass explosions is embarrassing .",
    "in fact , not even the relative ejecta masses are known .",
    "if the above argumentation is correct ( section  [ sec : disccor ] ) , then we have a first sign of explosions with different masses .",
    "the first direct detection of the @xmath24rays from the nuclear decay of @xmath50ni and @xmath50co would be a major success .",
    "such a detection is within reach of the current instruments on cgro or integral ( hflich et al .",
    "1998a , georgii et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the combination of the @xmath24ray detection with the observed ( uvoir ) bolometric light curve will be a powerful tool to measure the escape fraction and hence the energy release in sne  ia .",
    "statistical studies of the bolometric luminosity of sne  ia will further delineate their true luminosity and hence nickel mass distribution .",
    "with such information it will become possible to decide what the major stellar evolution channels for sne  ia are .",
    "we are entering an interesting phase , where searches will be volume limited even for faint sne  ia and fair samples can be established .",
    "the future is bright for sn  ia research .",
    "the extension to high - redshift searches and the inherent possibility to probe sne  ia over significant look back times offers the opportunity to follow a specific tracer of individual stars over a large fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "this addition to the current supernova research will tell us about the history of stars beyond the cosmological implications championed so far .",
    "parts of this review have been written during visits at the astronomical institute in basel and the stockholm observatory .",
    "i would like to thank a. g. tammann and c. fransson for their hospitality .",
    "many discussions with m. phillips , n. suntzeff , b. schmidt , r. kirshner , a. riess , p. meikle , k. nomoto , w. hillebrandt , and a. filippenko are acknowledged .",

    "<S> the bolometric light curves are a handy tool to investigate the overall appearance of type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the nickel masses derived this way show large variations , which combined with the dynamics from line widths , indicate that the brighter events are also coming from more massive objects .    </S>",
    "<S> the lack of accurate distances and the uncertainty in the correction for absorption are hampering further progress . </S>",
    "<S> improvements in these areas are vital for the detailed comparison of luminosities and the determination of nickel masses . </S>",
    "<S> coverage at near - infrared wavelengths for a statistical sample of type ia supernovae will at least decrease the dependence on the absorption . </S>",
    "<S> some of the most intriguing features of type ia supernovae are best observed at these wavelengths , like the second peak in the light curve , the depression in the _ j _ band , and the unblended [ fe  ii ] lines in the ashes .    to appear in _ the astronomy and astrophysics review _ </S>"
