    "modelling the large - scale quantities in a turbulent flow is very important in many applications , e.g. , fluid and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , rayleigh bnard convection ( rbc ) , rotating turbulence , etc  @xcite .",
    "one such quantity is the magnitude of the large - scale velocity that plays a critical role in physical processes . in this paper",
    "we will quantify this and other related quantities for rbc .",
    "rbc is an idealized version of thermal convection in which a thin layer of fluid confined between two horizontal plates separated by a distance @xmath5 is heated from below and cooled from top .",
    "the properties of rbc is specified using two nondimensional parameters : the rayleigh number @xmath1 , which is the ratio of the buoyancy term and the diffusion term , and the prandtl number @xmath2 , which is the ratio of kinematic viscosity @xmath6 and thermal diffusivity @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "some of the important quantities of interest in rbc are the large - scale velocity @xmath0 or pclet number @xmath8 , and the nusselt number @xmath9 , which is the ratio of the total heat flux to the conductive heat flux .",
    "note that the reynolds number @xmath10 .",
    "the pclet and nusselt numbers are strong functions of @xmath2 , as shown by grossmann and lohse  @xcite ( referred to as gl ) . according to gl scaling , for small and moderate @xmath2 s , @xmath11 , but for large @xmath2 , @xmath12 .",
    "the above scaling have been verified in many experiments  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we derive a general formula for @xmath13 , of which the aforementioned relations are limiting cases , by comparing the relative strengths of the nonlinear , pressure , buoyancy , and viscous terms , and quantifying them using the numerical data .",
    "our derivation of the @xmath13 formula differs from the grossmann and lohse s  @xcite formalism ; comparison between the two approaches will be discussed towards the end of the paper .    before describing the pclet number formula , we briefly discuss the properties of the temperature fluctuations .",
    "we normalize the temperature by the temperature difference between the plates @xmath14 , and the vertical coordinate @xmath15 by the plate distance @xmath5 . the profile of the plane - averaged temperature , @xmath16 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tz ] , exhibits an approximate constant value of 1/2 in the bulk and steep variations in the thermal boundary layer .",
    "it is customary to write rbc equations in terms of the temperature fluctuation from the conduction state , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 with @xmath19 as the temperature profile for the conduction state .",
    "the planar mean of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tz ] .     exhibits a near constant value in the bulk , and steep variations in the thermal boundary layers whose thickness is @xmath22 .",

    "the momentum equation for rbc is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the velocity and pressure fields respectively , @xmath27 is the thermal expansion coefficient , and @xmath28 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "here we have taken the density to be unity . under a steady state",
    "( @xmath29 ) , the acceleration of a fluid parcel , @xmath30 , is provided by the pressure gradient @xmath31 , buoyancy @xmath32 , and the viscous term @xmath33 . for a viscous flow ,",
    "the net force or acceleration is very small , and the viscous force balances the buoyancy .",
    "however , in the turbulent regime , the pressure gradient dominates the buoyancy and viscous forces ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "we quantify these accelerations using numerical data that help us understand the scaling of the pclet number and related quantities for arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the velocity fourier modes @xmath34 due to incompressibility and no - mean flow condition .",
    "hence @xmath35 corresponding to @xmath21 follows a relation : @xmath36 or @xmath37 . therefore ,",
    "in the momentum equation , the fourier modes other than @xmath38 involve @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively ( see appendix ) .     of a fluid parcel that is rising against gravity : ( a ) in the turbulent regime ,",
    "@xmath41 is provided primarily by the pressure gradient @xmath42 ; ( b ) in the viscous regime , @xmath43 with the buoyancy and viscous terms balancing each other .",
    "the direction of the forces are reversed for a descending fluid parcel .",
    "note that buoyancy acts downward for the fluid parcels colder than the background . ]",
    "we solve the rbc equations  @xcite in a three - dimensional unit box for @xmath44 and rayleigh numbers between @xmath45 and @xmath46 on grids @xmath47 and @xmath48 using the finite volume code openfoam  @xcite .",
    "we employ the no - slip boundary condition for the velocity field at all the walls , the conducting boundary condition at the top and bottom walls , and the insulating boundary condition at the vertical walls . for time",

    "our results demonstrate that the dissipation rates in rbc differ from those in unbounded flows due to the walls .",
    "let us estimate the ratio of the total dissipation rates ( product of the dissipation rate and the appropriate volume ) in the boundary layer ( @xmath69 ) and in the bulk ( @xmath70 ) . in the turbulent regime @xmath71 since @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath73 is the thickness of the viscous boundary layers at the top and bottom plates , and @xmath74 is the cross section area of these plates .",
    "the factor 2 is included to account for the dissipation near both the plates .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : du ] ) indicates that @xmath75 for large @xmath76 . in the viscous regime",
    ", the boundary layer spans the whole region ( @xmath77 ) , therefore @xmath69 dominates @xmath78 . also , our formula [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : pe_analy ] ) ] includes both the turbulent and viscous regimes .",
    "earlier grossmann and lohse  @xcite estimated @xmath0 and the nusselt number by invoking the exact relations of shraiman and siggia  @xcite and using the fact that the total dissipation is a sum of those in the bulk and in the boundary layers ( @xmath70 and @xmath69 respectively ) .",
    "our derivation is an alternative to that of gl with an attempt to highlight the anisotropic effects arising due to the boundary layers that yield @xmath56 and @xmath79 .",
    "note that our derivation does not use shraiman and siggia s  @xcite exact relations , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the bulk viscous and thermal dissipation rates respectively .",
    "the agreement between our model and earlier experiments and numerical simulations is remarkable , considering that our prediction is based on cubical box , while the experiments and numerical simulations employ cubical and cylindrical geometry .",
    "this result indicates that the pclet scaling is _ weakly _ dependent on the aspect ratio or geometry , and it can be reasonably well described by the nonlinear equation [ eq .  ( [ eq : u ] ) ] which is based on the scaling of the large - scale quantities .",
    "this is one of the important conclusions of our work as well as that of grossmann and lohse  @xcite .",
    "note however that the discrepancies between the model predictions and the experiments results ( see fig .  [ fig : pe ] ) could be due to weak dependence of pclet number on geometry or aspect ratio .",
    "the above observations indicate that the flow behaviour in rbc differs significantly from the unbounded hydrodynamic turbulence for which we employ homogeneous and isotropic formalism .",
    "interestingly , in turbulent rbc , the buoyancy term is _ nearly _ cancelled by the viscous term .",
    "this feature of rbc could be the reason for the kolmogorov s spectrum in rbc , as reported by kumar _",
    "et al . _",
    "the aforementioned wall effects should also be present in other bounded flows such as in channels , pipes , rotating convection , spheres , and cylinders .",
    "the procedure adopted in this paper would yield similar formulae for the large - scale velocity and the dissipation rate for these systems .    in summary , we derive a general formula for the large scale velocity @xmath0 or the pclet number for rbc that is applicable for any @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our formula provides reasonable fits to the results of earlier experiments and numerical simulations .",

    "[ tab : ra_dependence ] , we also show how the dissipation rate @xmath87 and the temperature fluctuations in rbc get corrections from the usual formulas due to the boundary walls .",
    "our formulae discussed in this paper provide insights into the flow dynamics of rbc .",
