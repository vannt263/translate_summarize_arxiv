    "physics of mott - insulator has been an underlying concept to understand the intrigue phenomena in transition metal oxides such as perovskite - type materials @xcite .",
    "one of the most well - known systems is the high - temperature superconductor with the layered perovskite structure , e.g. la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath1 and la@xmath7ba@xmath8cuo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the perovskites lavo@xmath0 and ytio@xmath0 are also typical mott - insulators with the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ordering , respectively @xcite . generally , mott - insulating states can be understood within the framework of the mott - hubbard model as its name says . when the on - site repulsive coulomb energy between the @xmath3-electrons ( @xmath9 ) is larger than the bandwidth of the @xmath3-states ( @xmath10 ) , the mott - insulating phase appears in contrast to the band insulator where the @xmath3-shell is fully occupied @xcite .",
    "however , there exists many sophisticated situations rather than an ideal situation to be explained simply .",
    "for instance , the layered perovskite ca@xmath11ruo@xmath1 has shown the orbital selective metal - insulator transition @xcite . in sr@xmath11iro@xmath1",
    ", it has been reported that mott insulator develops due to the strong spin - orbit interaction of ir 5@xmath3-electrons @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been well known that the physics of the mott insulating states plays an important role to understand the metallic peroskite cavo@xmath0 and srvo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "mott - insulating a - site ordered perovskite cacu@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ccto ) has attracted much attention in both fundamental science and technological application , since the discovery of the extremely high dielectric constant ( @xmath12 ) in 2000 @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism of the high @xmath12 has not been fully understood yet , and it is still debating whether the high @xmath12 is intrinsic or extrinsic @xcite .",
    "this requires a study to clarify the fundamental properties such as the electronic structure .",
    "recently , we have successfully observed the band dispersion of ccto in the angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments and revealed that ccto is a mott - type insulator caused by the strong correlation effects : the cu 3@xmath3-o 2@xmath4 hybridized bands are shifted toward the lower energy side by @xmath5 1.7 ev and show band narrowing around @xmath62 ev in comparison with the local - density approximation ( lda ) band calculations @xcite .",
    "however , in order to fully understand the mechanism of the mott insulating states in ccto , the electronic structures in both the occupied and unoccupied regions should be investigated . in this paper",
    ", we report the electronic structures of ccto in the occupied and unoccupied regions revealed by photoemission ( pes ) and inverse photoemission spectroscopy ( ipes ) .",
    "the polycrystalline sample of ccto has been synthesized by the conventional solid state reaction technique using caco@xmath0 , cuo , and tio@xmath11 powders .",
    "the well mixed powders with the stoichiometric weights were calcined at 700 @xmath13c for 12 hours .",
    "the pellets pressed by 40 mpa were sintered at 1050 @xmath13c for 24 hours .",
    "these processes have been repeated several times to obtain the high - quality sample .",
    "single phase of ccto was confirmed by the x - ray diffraction pattern .",
    "the pes experiments have been performed at the synchrotron radiation beam line bl5u of uvsor .",
    "the used photon energies ( @xmath14 ) are 30 , 65 , and 90 ev .",
    "the total energy resolution is about 75 mev at @xmath15 = 65 ev .",
    "the ipes experiments have been carried out at hisor , using a stand - alone apparatus with the tunable photon energy mode @xcite .",
    "the used kinetic energies of incident electrons ( @xmath16 ) are 40 and 46 ev .",
    "the energy resolution was set to about 650 mev at @xmath16 = 46 ev .",
    "all measurements have been performed at the room - temperature ( @xmath17 @xmath5 300 k ) .",
    "the clean surface of sample was prepared by _ in situ _ fracturing in the ultra - high vacuum of @xmath5 2 @xmath18 10@xmath19 pa . the fermi - level ( @xmath20 ) in pes and ipes measurements was referred to that of au at 300 k and 10 k , respectively .",

    "this may come from the charging effects of an insulating sample during the measurement process . in spite of that",
    ", the good consistency of the spectral shape with the arpes results indicates that the observed pes spectra are revealing the intrinsic electronic structures of ccto .",
    "the inset shows the enlarged spectrum of the shoulder structure around 2 ev , which was plotted by shifting toward the higher energy side by 0.2 ev to correct @xmath20 .",
    "the peak position can be estimated to be @xmath5 @xmath61.7 ev , and the tail of the band is also observed at @xmath5 @xmath61.2 ev . in the region from @xmath68 to @xmath613 ev , there are two peaks , a around @xmath69 ev and b around @xmath612 ev . these can be considered as multiplet structures of cu 3@xmath3 states hybridized with o 2@xmath4 states as in cuo which is representative of strongly correlated electrons systems @xcite . actually , the valence band of ccto is very similar to that of cuo except for the position of the intense cu 3@xmath3 peak which is located around @xmath63 ev in cuo @xcite .",
    "( it should be noted that most of the ti 3@xmath3 states exist in the unoccupied region and that most of the ca @xmath21-states thinly spread over the whole valence band . )",
    "this means that the electronic structure of cu 3@xmath3 states of ccto is close to that of cuo .",
    "therefore , the two peaks a and b in ccto can be understood on the basis of the interpretation of cuo .",
    "the peak a around @xmath69 ev is the final states of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is a hole of ligands ) , while the peak b around @xmath612 ev comes mainly from the @xmath22 final states @xcite .",
    "it is recognized that the peak b drastically changes with @xmath15 . in the photoemission process",
    ", it is well known that the photoionization cross section ( @xmath25 ) depends on the kinetic energy of photoelectrons , which can be changed with @xmath15 @xcite . in the @xmath15 of 30 - 90 ev",
    ", the @xmath25 of the o 2@xmath4 orbital rapidly increases with decreasing @xmath15 compared to that of the cu 3@xmath3 orbital @xcite .",
    "the intensity of peak b decreases with decreasing @xmath15 and seems to disappear at @xmath15 = 30 ev , while the intensity of peak a does not change with @xmath15 , relatively .",
    "in other words , the relative intensity of peak a to peak b increases with decreasing @xmath15 . from the above argument , we can conclude that the peak a includes a considerable number of o 2@xmath4 states while peak b consists mainly of cu 3@xmath3 states .",
    "this indicates that the cu 3@xmath3-o 2@xmath4 hybridized bands compose the multiplet structures , which are usually considered to come from atomic states .",

    "the solid triangle and arrow indicate the peak position ( @xmath5 1.5 ev ) and the tail ( @xmath5 0.3 ev ) of the upper hubbard band , respectively . , width=264 ]    figure 2 shows the ipes spectra around the ti 3@xmath4 - 3@xmath3 edge .",
    "the cross section of the ti 3@xmath3 states can be largely enhanced around the ti 3@xmath4 - 3@xmath3 edge via the fano - resonance between the standard ipes process and the coster - kronig auger process @xcite .",
    "additionally , it has been reported that the energies of on- and off - resonance ipes are about 46 ev and 39 ev , respectively @xcite . in the off - resonant ipes spectrum ( @xmath16 = 40 ev ) , we observe three features ; a broad shoulder structure in 0 - 3 ev , a relatively intense peak at @xmath5 3.8 ev , and a broad hump structure in 8 - 12 ev .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2 shows the enlarged spectrum around the broad shoulder structure .",
    "the spectral weight is negligible around @xmath20 , indicating an insulating character .",
    "it then begins to increase just above @xmath20 , forming a broad shoulder from 0.5 to 2.5 ev .",
    "the peak position can be evaluated from the midpoint of the broad shoulder ( @xmath5 1.5 ev ) .",
    "when we take into account the energy resolution of 0.65 ev , the tail of the band should exist between 0 to 0.6 ev and its midpoint ( @xmath5 0.3 ev ) is indicated by the arrow . in the on - resonant ipes spectrum ( @xmath16 = 46 ev ) , we find that the peak at @xmath5 3.8 ev is slightly sharper than that of the off - resonant ipes spectrum .",
    "however , it is difficult to extract the ti 3@xmath3 spectrum from the difference between the on- and off - resonant spectra due to the small resonant effects . in order to discover the reason why the resonance is not effective in ccto , further study is necessary .",
    "for our purpose here , we identify elements of the spectral weight by comparing the ipes spectra with the band calculations . in the lower part of fig.2",
    ", we plot the partial density of states ( dos ) of ti 3@xmath3 , ca 3@xmath3 , cu 3@xmath3 , and o 2@xmath4 states obtained from the lda calculations , shifting it toward the higher energy side by about 1.5 ev .",
    "we can recognize that the shifted partial dos reproduces the ipes spectra .",
    "the spectral weight of peak at @xmath5 3.8 ev comes mainly from ti 3@xmath3 states , and the broad hump structure in 8 - 12 ev can be attributed mainly to ca 3@xmath3 states .",
    "moreover , the shoulder structure at @xmath5 1.5 ev consists of a large number of cu 3@xmath3 , o 2@xmath4 states and a small number of ti 3@xmath3 states , which are said to be located around @xmath20 in the prediction of the lda calculations .",

    "the solid triangles and arrows on the spectra indicate the peak position and the tail of the hubbard bands , respectively ( b ) schematic diagram of the strong correlation effects in ccto .",
    ", width=283 ]    finally , we would like to discuss the mechanism of the mott - insulating states in ccto , considering the strong correlation effects . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the pes spectrum at @xmath15 = 65 ev and the ipes spectrum at @xmath16 = 40 ev are plotted together . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "the partial dos of the cu 3@xmath3 and ti 3@xmath3 states obtained from the lda calculations has been also presented in the lower part of fig .",
    "it should be noted that the strong correlation effects can not be fully understood within the framework of the lda calculations in general and have often been discussed by comparing experimental results and lda calculations @xcite .",
    "figure 3(b ) is a schematic diagram , which explains how the electronic structures of ccto are affected by the strong correlation effects .",
    "first , let us discuss the spectra near @xmath20 .",
    "the spectral weights are negligible in both pes and ipes experiments showing the insulating phase , while there exists the dos of the cu 3@xmath3 and small ti 3@xmath3 states , which are hybridized with the o 2@xmath4 states , in the lda calculations .",
    "it is also observed that the shoulder structures at @xmath5 @xmath61.7 ev and @xmath5 1.5 ev are symmetric with respect to @xmath20 as in the other mott - insulators @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the dos near @xmath20 of the lda calculation is separated into the upper hubbard band ( uhb ) at @xmath5 1.5 ev and the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) at @xmath5 @xmath61.7 ev @xcite .",
    "the energy gap ( @xmath26 ) can be estimated to be @xmath5 1.5@xmath270.3 ev from the energy difference between the tails of lhb and uhb . moreover , when we take into account the results of the optical experiments , where @xmath26 is larger than 1.5 ev @xcite , @xmath26 should be @xmath5 1.5 - 1.8 ev . from the above results ,",
    "@xmath9 is estimated to be @xmath5 3.2 ev . the @xmath10 of lhb is @xmath5 1 ev in the pes spectrum , and the @xmath10 of uhb can be estimated to be @xmath5 1.5 - 2 ev considering the experimental resolution in the ipes spectrum .",
    "these values are qualitatively consistent with the simple mott - hubbard model , where @xmath28 .    secondly , let us discuss the spectra in the region from @xmath63 to @xmath66 ev and from 3 to 6 ev . in comparison with the lda calculations ,",
    "the cu 3@xmath3 peak is shifted from @xmath61.5 to @xmath63.8 ev in the occupied region , and the ti 3@xmath3 peak is shifted from 2.4 to 3.8 ev in the unoccupied region .",
    "this seems similar to the behavior of the incoherent states in the simple mott - hubbard picture",
    ". however , ccto looks more complicated .",
    "the observed peak shifts occur far away from @xmath20 and are not directly relevant to the insulating phase .",
    "in addition , the cu- and ti - ions are located in different sites ( the a- and b - sites , respectively ) and that the o - ions are in between them ; a - site ordered perovskites have a crystal structure of the formula aa@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can recognize that the shifts of the cu 3@xmath3 and ti 3@xmath3 peaks appear in pairs and are accompanied by the separation of the hubbard bands .",
    "for the occupied region , it has been reported in the previous arpes studies that the strong correlation effects in the cu 3@xmath3-o 2@xmath4 hybridized bands cause the shift of the cu 3@xmath3 peak toward the lower energy side @xcite . and ,",
    "the uhb and lhb come from not only the cu 3@xmath3-o 2@xmath4 hybridized bands but also small ti 3@xmath3-o 2@xmath4 hybridized bands as discussed in fig .",
    "these indicate that the ti 3@xmath3 electrons hybridized with o 2@xmath4 states are also strongly correlated , which causes the shift of the ti 3@xmath3 peak toward the higher energy side , as in the case of the cu 3@xmath3 electrons . as a result , the cu 3@xmath3 and ti 3@xmath3 electrons hybridized with the o 2@xmath4 states",
    "are strongly correlated , which is responsible for the mott - insulating states and the band shifting in ccto .",
    "we believe that these results will contribute to the understanding of new - type mott - insulators and the duality of the strongly correlated @xmath3-electrons .",
    "the mechanism of mott - insulating behavior of ccto has been investigated by the pes and ipes experiments . in the region from @xmath62 to 2 ev , uhb and lhb , which consist mainly of cu 3@xmath3-o 2@xmath4 hybridized bands , have been observed at @xmath5 1.5 and @xmath5 @xmath61.7 ev , respectively .",
    "the cu 3@xmath3 peak at @xmath5 @xmath63.8 ev and ti 3@xmath3 peak at 3.8 ev are further away from each other than as predicted in the lda calculations . in addition",
    ", the strong @xmath15 dependence of the pes spectrum in the region from @xmath68 to @xmath613 ev indicates that the multiplet structure a around @xmath69 ev includes a considerable number of o 2@xmath4 states .",
    "these results reveal that the strong correlation effects of the cu 3@xmath3 and ti 3@xmath3 electrons , which are hybridized with the o 2@xmath4 states , give rise to the mott - insulating states of ccto .",
