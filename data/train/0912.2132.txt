    "the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres is a quickly maturing field . thus far",
    ", observations have revealed an intriguing range of results that are in turn feeding back into a rapidly evolving theoretical paradigm .",
    "the most fruitful method of investigation to date is the detection of secondary eclipses of hot jupiters  highly irradiated gas giant planets in short period ( 23 day ) orbits . by measuring the relative depths of the secondary eclipse of an exoplanet in multiple bandpasses",
    ", one can reconstruct a low - resolution emission spectrum from the dayside of the planet .",
    "the planet / star flux ratio is highest at infrared wavelengths , due to the thermal emission from the planet .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ has been used to measure the infrared secondary eclipse depths for a growing list of extrasolar planets .",
    "these measurements reveal that the atmospheres span two distinct categories : those with temperature inversions in the upper atmospheres ( hd  209458b , @xcite ; xo-1b , @xcite ; tres-4 , @xcite ; and xo-2b , @xcite ) , and those without ( tres-1 , @xcite ; hd 189733b , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the distinguishing factor between the two classes is the incident flux on the planet , with higher incident flux resulting in gas - phase tio / vo @xcite or non - equilibrium products of photochemistry , as seen in solar system bodies @xcite .",
    "the additional absorber in the upper atmosphere generates the temperature inversion . orbiting an f6 star , with a large stellar radius and high stellar temperature , in a short orbital period ,",
    "hat - p-7b is one of the most highly irradiated hot jupiters , receiving @xmath10  erg  s@xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "it is therefore predicted to have a temperature inversion .    at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the planet / star flux ratio is an order of magnitude less favorable than in the infrared , due to the much lower thermal emission from the planet at the shorter wavelengths , and also the low optical reflectance expected from cloud - free atmosphere models .",
    "although observing at optical wavelengths makes the detection of the secondary eclipse more difficult , it can provide very useful information .",
    "for instance , in the case of hd 209458b , the observed temperature inversion implies the presence of an unknown absorber high in the atmosphere , as mentioned above @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite placed very stringent upper limits on the optical depth of the secondary eclipse using the _ microvariablity and oscillations of stars _ ( _ most _ ) satellite , and concluded that the absorber must have low reflectance . optical secondary eclipses have been detected for corot-1b @xcite and corot-2b @xcite with relatively low significance using the _ corot _ spacecraft , and with high significance for hat - p-7b @xcite using the _ kepler _ spacecraft .",
    "the only detection of an optical secondary eclipse from the ground at the time of submission is for ogle - tr-56b in the @xmath13 band @xcite .",
    "the next step is to combine the optical and infrared secondary eclipse measurements to extend the planetary emission spectrum and refine statements about the atmospheric properties .",
    "prior to the launch of _ kepler _ , observations of hat - p-7b were obtained with the epoch ( extrasolar planet observation and characterization ) component of the nasa _ epoxi _ mission of opportunity .",
    "one of the science goals of this mission was to measure or place meaningful upper limits upon the geometric albedo of a small set of transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "the goal of this paper is to combine the hat - p-7b secondary eclipse measurements made with the _ epoxi _ , _ kepler _ and _ spitzer _ spacecraft to generate a broadband spectrum covering @xmath14 m , and to identify a set of model planetary atmospheres that reproduce the observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : epoxi ] , we describe the _ epoxi _ observations and data analysis ; in section [ sec : spitzer ] , we describe our analysis of the _ spitzer _ observations of hat - p-7 ; in section [ sec : combined ] we combine the results of these two data sets with the published _ kepler _",
    "secondary eclipse measurement and describe the model fits to the final spectrum ; and in section [ sec : future ] we discuss the conclusions of the paper and the extension of this analysis to additional _ epoxi _ targets .",
    "hat - p-7b was the final transiting extrasolar planet target observed with _",
    "epoxi_. we observed eight transits : the first in the ` pre - look ' , an initial two day observation window ( ut 2008 august 8 and 9 ) to refine the pointing , the latter seven observed consecutively in a fifteen day observation run lasting from ut 2008 august 16 to august 31 .",
    "seven secondary eclipses were observed during the run .",
    "we obtained 26,781 observations of hat - p-7 in total .",
    "we observed hat - p-7 with the 30-cm diameter high resolution instrument ( hri ) on - board the _ epoxi _ spacecraft .",
    "we used the 1024@xmath151024 pixel ccd with a clear filter , providing wavelength coverage from 350 to 1000 nm .",
    "the instrument is significantly defocused , with the psf having a fwhm of 9.0 pixels ( 3.7 arcsec ) . due to on - board memory limiting the number of full frame images that could be stored , we observed in two sub - array modes : 128@xmath15128 pixels typically , and 256@xmath15256 pixels during times of select transits and eclipses to minimize pointing losses .",
    "observations were taken nearly continuously , with gaps of approximately 7 hours every 23 days to download the data from the spacecraft .",
    "the data reduction pipeline is detailed in @xcite and summarized here .",
    "we receive calibrated data products from the existing deep impact pipeline @xcite , to which we apply an additional bias correction .",
    "we use psf - fitting to find the position of the target star in each image to within a hundredth of a pixel ; we discard 4850 images at this stage due to the star falling out of the field of view or too close to the edge of the ccd for accurate photometry .",
    "we discard an additional 40 images due to significant ( 15-@xmath5 ) deviations from the model psf , caused by readout smear or radiation events .",
    "we then apply several corrections based on our knowledge of the ccd architecture , including scaling down the flux values in the two rows and two columns that form the internal boundaries at the center of the ccd , which has readout electronics in each of the four corners .",
    "we also scale the counts in images taken in 256@xmath15256 mode to those taken in 128@xmath15128 mode , to account for a systematic flux offset between the two modes .",
    "finally , we divide the images by a flat field generated from a green led stimulator lamp mounted beside the ccd , which corrects for changes in the position - dependent sensitivity that have occurred since the detector was characterized prior to launch .",
    "we obtained these calibration frames ( ` stims ' ) in six short blocks , each of approximately 20 minutes duration , spaced every few days during the observations of hat - p-7 .",
    "each block contained 250 images , and in total we obtained 500 stims in 128@xmath15128 mode and 1000 in 256@xmath15256 mode .",
    "we correct each science frame in a given mode with the stims obtained in that mode .",
    "we perform aperture photometry on the resulting images , using a 10-pixel radius aperture . at this stage",
    "there is still considerable correlated noise in the data , shown as the lower light curve in figure  [ fig : lc ] , due to the time - variable jitter in the spacecraft pointing . for the observations of hat - p-7 this jitter was on the order of 10 arcsec ( 40 pixels ) hr@xmath11 .",
    "we find that the monochromatic green stims are a poor representation of the interpixel sensitivity , which seems to have a color - dependent component , and as a result the pointing jitter introduces correlated noise that we are unable to remove with the calibration frames .",
    "we subsequently use the out - of - transit and out - of - eclipse data to map out the brightness variations with ccd position . for a small random subset ( 6% of the 21684 points in the light curve )",
    "we find an iteratively sigma - clipped mean of the closest spatially neighbouring points , and use these values to generate a surface .",
    "we then fit a 2-dimensional spatial spline to the surface , and correct each point in the light curve by interpolating onto this surface .",
    "we discard an additional 207 frames affected by readout smear or radiation events at this stage , resulting in a final set of 21684 images .",
    "the full corrected light curve is shown as the upper light curve in figure  [ fig : lc ] , with an out - of - transit scatter that is 91% above that expected from poisson noise .",
    "the excess is due to the remaining correlated noise that we have been unable to calibrate , and is higher than the 56% value we attained for the _ epoxi _ observations of gj 436 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hat - p-7 light curve has approximately two - thirds the number of observations of gj 436 , and that these observations are distributed over a larger fraction of the ccd .",
    "both of these effects decrease the robustness of the spatial spline and result in higher residual correlated noise .",
    "there are two ` flare'-type events visible in the light curve , both of which we believe to be instrumental artifacts . the first occurs during the pre - look , at which time one of the four ccd quadrants was affected by a particular systematic flux correlation that was observed for other _ epoxi _ targets . for the remainder of the hat - p-7 observations this systematic effect was not present , and therefore the data obtained during the pre - look in this particular quadrant are not well calibrated by the spline . the second , which can be seen at approximately 18.6 days in figure  [ fig : lc ] , occurs at a time when the star was illuminating a part of the ccd to which it does not return in the course of the hat - p-7 observations .",
    "the spline procedure we describe above therefore fails , since it relies on multiple visits to the same parts of the detector .",

    "we found previously that for the wide _ epoxi _ bandpass the choice of limb - darkening treatment did not systematically affect the results @xcite .",
    "we fit the four coefficients of the non - linear limb - darkening law of @xcite to 17 positions across the stellar limb .",
    "we repeat this fit in 0.2 nm intervals across the 3501000 nm bandpass , weighted for the total sensitivity ( including filter , optics and ccd response ) and photon count at each wavelength .",
    "we calculate the final set of coefficients as the average of the weighted sum across the bandpass , bi - linearly interpolated between the four models , for which we find @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "we first consider the transits observed by _ epoxi_.",
    "we fit each transit with a linear , time - dependent slope using four hours of data before and four hours of data after the transit , to remove any residual instrumental linear trend .",
    "we use the analytic algorithms of @xcite to fit the transit parameters , using @xmath25 as the goodness - of - fit estimator . using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm",
    ", we fit for three geometric parameters : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the planetary and stellar radii respectively ; @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the semi - major axis ; and cos @xmath31 , where @xmath31 is the inclination of the orbit .",
    "we also fit for eight times of transit center for a total of eleven free parameters .",
    "we initially fix the period to the value from the discovery paper @xcite , 2.2047299  days .",
    "we find @xmath32 , @xmath33 and cos @xmath34 . in order to account for the effects of the remaining systematics in the error budget , we use the `` rosary bead '' residual permutation method described by @xcite , with 2000 permutations .",
    "the quoted 1-@xmath5 errors encompass 68% of the permutations .",
    "the light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : binnedlc ] , phased and binned in 5 minute intervals , with the best fit model transit overplotted . using the stellar mass value derived by @xcite , @xmath35 , we find @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath36  deg , which are consistent with and an improvement over the values in the discovery paper",
    ". however , they are moderately inconsistent with the parameters presented in the recently posted @xcite paper ; a rigorous comparison of the results is not undertaken here .",
    "the new _ epoxi _ values and the best fit times of transit center are given in table [ tab : pars ] .",
    "for the transit times , shown in figure  [ fig : ttvs ] , we see no evidence for transit timing variations on the order of 12 minutes , and we use a weighted linear fit to derive a new ephemeris combining the discovery ephemeris and the eight times listed here : @xmath37 , @xmath6  days .",

    "when producing the full hat - p-7 light curve , we use only 6% of the data points to create the 2-dimensional spatial spline , in order to minimize suppression of any additional astrophysical signals in the data , such as transits of additional planets in the system . however , when trying to extract the shallow signal of the eclipses of hat - p-7b , we can make use of all of the data points that are not obtained during those events to increase the robustness of the calibration . for each event , we consider the points that occur within @xmath61 times the transit duration of hat - p-7b from the predicted center of eclipse , resulting in a window of approximately 12 hours duration .",

    "we determine the centers of the apertures by calculating the weighted sum of the flux in a circle of radius 3 pixels positioned at the approximate location of the star .",

    "observations in these shorter wavelength channels are characterized by a position - dependent flux sensitivity @xcite ; we fit for this sensitivity and the eclipse light curve simultaneously .",
    "we generate the light curve with the analytic equations from @xcite with no limb darkening , using the revised hat - p-7b parameters from the _ epoxi _ analysis .",
    "we model the intra - pixel flux sensitivity for both channels with linear and quadratic coefficients in x and y position , as shown in equation [ eq : intra - pixel ] , where the measured flux @xmath69 is a function of the incident flux @xmath70 and position ; adding higher order position terms or time - dependent terms did not significantly improve the final fit .",
    "@xmath71    for each channel , there are seven free parameters in the fit : a constant , a linear and a quadratic coefficient in x position , a linear and quadratic coefficient in y position , an eclipse depth , and a time of center of eclipse . for the fitting",

    "we measure nearly identical eclipse depths and errors for the rosary bead method as for the mcmc method , finding @xmath72% in the 3.6 micron band and @xmath73% in the 4.5 micron band . for the remainder of the paper",
    "we adopt the mcmc eclipse depths and errors .",
    "the 5.8 and 8.0 micron channels show a long timescale time - dependent ( as compared to position - dependent ) flux sensitivity .",
    "the correlation is strongest in the 8.0 micron channel , where an increase in the flux during the course of the observations , referred to as the ` detector ramp ' is evident .",
    "one interpretation of this is an increase in the effective gain of the pixels with time in the 8.0 micron detector .",
    "one successful method for mitigating this ramp is the preflash technique @xcite , where a bright diffuse region is observed immediately prior to the start of the target observations in order to pre - emptively increase the effective gain of the pixels .",
    "for the 8.0 micron observations of hat - p-7 , a 30 minute set of preflash observations , 3648 images in total , were obtained of the hii region gal 075.83 + 00.40 ( @xmath74 20 21 39.5 , @xmath75 + 37 31 04 ) .",

    "we also perform an iterative 3-@xmath5 flux cut over the running median to discard outliers , possibly caused by radiation events , which removes 47 ( 1.9% ) of 2453 images in the 5.8 micron channel , and 51 ( 2.4% ) of the remaining 2106 images in the 8.0 micron channels .",
    "we chose the time - dependent function that minimized the out - of - eclipse scatter , which was a linear function of ln(@xmath77 ) in both channels , where @xmath77 is the time elapsed from the center of the first observed transit , shown in equation [ eq : ln_dt ] .",
    "previous analyses have used quadratic functions of ln(@xmath77 ) @xcite , however by comparison the ramp is attenuated in both channels in these data , and adding higher order functions of time or position - dependent functions did not improve the fit .",

    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows one representative model that provides a best fit to the observations .",
    "the red circles with error bars are the data and the green circles are the bandpass integrated model points .",
    "the red dotted lines show the _ kepler _ and _ spitzer _ bandpasses .",
    "the black curve is the model fit .",
    "the blue dashed curves show two black - body spectra corresponding to 2029  k and 2974  k. the orange dashed curve shows a a black - body spectrum at 2600  k , for reference .",
    "the inset shows a zoom - in of the _ kepler _ point and the model in the 0.4 - 1.0 @xmath99 range .",
    "the cyan and purple curves in the inset show the thermal emission and scattered light , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : pt ] shows the pressure - temperature ( p - t ) profile of the model atmosphere .",
    "we find that all of our best fit models require a thermal inversion to fit the data . a thermal inversion is strongly suggested by the high flux ratio in the 4.5 micron channel of _ spitzer _ compared to the 3.6 micron channel , in addition to the high flux ratios in the 5.8 and 8 micron channels .",
    "the emission features in the 4.5 micron and 5.8 micron channels are due to co and h@xmath96o , respectively .",
    "the features in the 3.6 micron and 8 micron channels are predominantly due to ch@xmath97 .",
    "the molecular mixing ratios ( with respect to h@xmath96 ) for the model shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] , are h@xmath96o = 1.0@xmath100 , co = 1.0@xmath100 , ch@xmath97 = 1.0@xmath101 , and no co@xmath96 .",
    "if we relax the model assumption of thermochemical equilibrium , and allow a ` best fit ' to the data to be defined by 1.25-@xmath5 errors , it is possible to generate suitable models that do not have a thermal inversion .",
    "however , these models require an overabundance of ch@xmath97 in the atmosphere . given the very hot atmosphere of hat - p-7b , thermochemical equilibrium favors a high abundance of co and low ch@xmath97 .",
    "therefore , a non - inversion model fit to data would imply signs of extreme non - equilibrium chemistry @xcite .    for a planet as hot as hat - p-7 , both scattered starlight and planet thermal emission could contribute to the planet flux in the _ kepler _ bandpass @xcite .",
    "the relative amount of scattered starlight and thermal emission depends on the absorbers and scatterers at visible wavelengths : molecular opacities due to tio and vo , atomic opacities due to na and k , and rayleigh scattering mostly from h@xmath96 .",
    "hat - p-7b is too hot for condensates , and without a reflective condensate layer , visible - wavelength photons will be absorbed before they can be scattered , except at very blue wavelengths . even without a rigorous quantitative model , therefore , we can infer that the albedo of hat - p-7b is likely to be low .",
    "our best fit models show a low albedo and include the prominent sources of opacity in the optical .",
    "the model shown gives a geometric albedo of about 0.13 in the _ kepler _ bandpass , and has scattered light dominating at wavelengths blueward of approximately 0.6 microns and the planet s thermal emission dominating redward of approximately 0.6 microns .",
    "the abundances of na and k are free parameters in the model and are found to be 0.01 solar ; similarly the tio / vo abundances are found to be @xmath102 of their solar abundances .",
    "we note that even though tio and vo are expected to contribute to the visible and ir opacity , whether they are responsible for the thermal inversion is not known ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasize that the _ kepler _ data point for hat - p-7b was instrumental in constraining the p - t profile , beyond the constraints placed by the spitzer data alone .",
    "this is particularly true because of the high planet - star flux ratio of hat - p-7b ; in general , a visible - wavelength observation with a lower contrast may not be as useful for constraining p - t profile .",
    "the values of atomic and molecular abundances present in our models are valid in the framework of a 1d averaged day - side atmosphere .",
    "the true values of atomic and molecular abundances , and hence the resulting albedo , in the atmosphere of hat - p-7b depend on the 3d atmospheric structure , and in 3d are degenerate at the resolution of the _ kepler _ data point .",
    "the _ kepler _ phase curve @xcite shows a very inefficient day - night redistribution of absorbed stellar energy .",
    "although energy redistribution is not a focus of this paper , we emphasize that a relatively inefficient day - night redistribution is consistent with , and even required by , our best fit models . we find that approximately 10% of the incident stellar flux is redistributed to the night side , under the assumption that the visible and infrared thermal phase curves will be similar .",
    ", showing a temperature inversion.,width=288 ]",
    "we have assembled a broadband emission spectrum of the highly irradiated dayside of hat - p-7b , extending from 0.358.0 micron .",
    "we find that this spectrum is best reproduced using an atmospheric model with a temperature inversion , supporting the hypothesis that the presence of an inversion layer is related to the absorbed stellar radiation . a census of exoplanet atmospheres at 3.6 and 4.5 micron that is being undertaken as part of the warm _ spitzer",
    "_ program will shed more light on the parameter space between where temperature inversions are present in the atmospheres of the most highly irradiated planets and absent in the less irradiated planets .",
    "this will include full phase curves of hat - p-7 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns , which will further constrain the redistribution and energy budget of the planetary atmosphere .",
    "in addition , as the _ kepler _ observations of hat - p-7 accumulate , the quality of the resulting light curve will be exquisite .",
    "this will not only provide higher constraints on the secondary eclipse and phase curve measurements , but will allow investigation into the variability of the planetary emission properties .    at optical wavelengths , we find that the best fit models predict a low geometric albedo of @xmath4 , which is far less reflective than gas giants in our solar system ( e.g. 0.52 for jupiter ) .",
    "the extremely hot atmosphere precludes the condensation of a reflective layer ( i.e. clouds ) , and our predicted albedo is consistent with those measured for other hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "the _ epoxi _ hat - p-7 secondary eclipse constraint is one of the few opportunities to confirm the _ kepler _ measurement , given that the relative depth of the signal at visible wavelengths is on the order of @xmath102 .",
    "we observed a second transiting exoplanet target in the _ kepler _ field of view with _ epoxi _ , tres-2 , obtaining similar phase coverage to hat - p-7 , and will present those results in a forthcoming paper .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations of tres-2 have been obtained in the four irac bandpasses , and we envision that an analysis of the extended broadband emission spectrum such as that described in this paper will be similarly fruitful in terms of constraining the properties of the planetary atmosphere . further _ epoxi _",
    "targets for which we will provide constraints on the geometric albedo are wasp-3 , tres-3 and hat - p-4 , all of which will have _ spitzer _ irac measurements of the infrared secondary eclipse depths in at least the 3.6 and 4.5 micron channels .",
