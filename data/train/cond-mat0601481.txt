    "coupled pairs of one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains , referred to as two - leg ladders , have been widely investigated within the spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian because they exhibit behavior different from both the isolated 1d chain as well as the two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice . ignoring electron occupations , two different kinds of couplings between the 1d chains , as shown in figs .",

    "1(b ) can also be considered as a 1d chain with the interstack ( intrastack ) couplings corresponding to the nearest neighbor ( next nearest neighbor ) couplings in the 1d chain .",
    "the spin gap in the antiferromagnetic zigzag ladder is nonzero only for the intrastack spin exchange above a critical value @xcite .",
    "nonzero spin gap is also found in the 1/2-filled band rectangular ladder within the hubbard hamiltonian with finite on - site electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction .",
    "@xcite spin gaps and superconducting pair - pair correlation functions in weakly doped rectangular ladders have been investigated within hubbard and t - j models @xcite .",
    "the strong interest in the theory of undoped and weakly doped 1/2-filled band ladders owes its origin to possible connections with theories of high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "whether or not significant spin gap occurs in ladder structures at other commensurate bandfillings is also an interesting question .",
    "the particular commensurate bandfilling that has been investigated so far is 1/4 .",

    "the calculated spin gaps in the thermodynamic limit , obtained from extrapolations , are nonzero for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the one - electron hopping parameters along the ladder rungs and legs , respectively , in agreement with weak coupling renormalization group calculations @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of the extrapolated spin gaps are , however , tiny . furthermore , the uncertainties in the extrapolated spin gaps are rather large in this parameter regime due to finite - size effects , and are comparable to the magnitudes of the spin gaps .",

    "the very large t@xmath11 in the the coupled - stack systems suggest that the mechanism by which the gap opens is probably unrelated to the intrachain spin - peierls transition , which in the 1/4-filled band is tetramerization , or dimerization of the dimerization .",

    "the enormous amount of computational time that would be necessary for performing all the calculations that are reported below makes the finite - system dmrg algorithm impractical in the present case .",
    "we note , however , that in nearly all the cases we discuss below the calculated spin gaps are large and easy to detect .",
    "we also note that the primary purpose of our work is to determine whether or not significant spin gaps are obtained within the dimerized ladder , and the precision required is not the same as within models where the gaps are tiny .",

    "the main difference between @xmath71 and @xmath46 0 is that the spin gap in the latter case is largest for @xmath72 1 , exactly the region where the spin gap is zero for @xmath32 = 0 .",

    "it has been claimed that such mapping can give rung spin exchange in the effective spin ladder larger than the nearest neighbor spin exchange along the legs , even for smaller hoppings along the rungs within the quarter - filled band electron ladder .",

    "indeed , had we performed our calculations self - consistently with e - p couplings that modulated the hopping integrals along the leg bonds , as opposed to with rigid bond - alternation @xmath32 , the amplitude of the bond - dimerization would have decreased with @xmath1 in the @xmath89 region and the coexistence region would have been narrower .",

    "2(d ) , the plots for the infinite system are expected to lie in between the curves for the 12 and 16-site ladders for each @xmath4 .",

    "thus both the electron ladder models would require substantial interchain hopping to give the observed large spin gaps .",
    "the difference between the two models is that while no charge order is expected within the rectangular ladder model for the charge - transfer solids , spin gap in the zigzag ladder is accompanied by strong charge order .",

    "4(a ) are in agreement to the conclusions of references and .",
    "as shown in these papers , because of the coupling between the ladders in @xmath17-nav@xmath12o@xmath18 , the charge order can drive effective bond dimerization along the ladder legs that is manifested in the alternation of intraladder coupling parameters ( there is a subtle difference between reference , which models @xmath17-nav@xmath12o@xmath18 as a system with charge order on only alternate ladders and reference which assumes charge order in every ladder ; this difference is not important in the present context . )",
    "the spin gaps in these references are explained within coupled dimerized spin chain models .",
    "dmrg calculations within the extended hubbard model for two coupled ladders with charge order also find spin gap up on extrapolation @xcite , but by necessity the maximum ladder length ( 20 rungs ) is small here .",
