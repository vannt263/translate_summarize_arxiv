    "in the 8 tev runs , and early 13 tev runs at the large hadron collider , both the atlas and cms collaborations has reported a significant excess of di - photon events with an invariant mass of about 750 gev @xcite .",
    "this is probably the first substantial hint at the lhc for any new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a large number of papers have appeared in the past seven months and a comprehensive list of citations can be found in @xcite .",
    "both the experimental status and the various theoretical approaches have also been nicely reviewed in @xcite . in most of the theoretical explanations ,",
    "the diphoton excess is being caused by a scalar resonance with a mass of 750 gev .",
    "this is being produced by strong interaction ( by the gluon gluon sub - process ) via the triangle loop of heavy vector - like quarks , and then decaying to two photons via the same loop .",
    "the main problem of this mechanism is that one has to assume many vector - like quarks , otherwise the coupling of the vector - like quark with the scalar singlet becomes way non - perturbative .",
    "another interesting approach that has been discussed is the photon initiated sub - process instead of the popular gluon initiated sub - process to produce this singlet scalar @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss di - photon signature of a 750 gev scalar resonance in the framework of a model , a part of which was originally proposed to generate a tiny neutrino mass with effective dimension seven operator @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we add an ew singlet scalar , which is the di - photon resonance , to this model .",
    "photon - photon fusion is the dominant production mechanism for this model at the lhc .",
    "in addition to the sm particles , the model includes an isospin @xmath0 scalar ( @xmath2 ) and two triplet vector - like leptons .",
    "the most general scalar potential includes dimension-3 interactions involving the singlet scalar and @xmath2 .",
    "being induced via loops involving multicharged ( triply , doubly and singly ) isosipn @xmath0 scalars , one expects significant enhancement in @xmath3 coupling .",
    "therefore , it is instructive to study the di - photon signature of the scalar-@xmath4 in the context of recent lhc reports of di - photon excess at 750 gev .",
    "being singlet , the scalar-@xmath4 does not couple to the sm gauge bosons at tree level . moreover , the yukawa interactions involving @xmath4 and the sm fermions are forbidden due to the chiral nature of the sm fermions . therefore , at the lhc",
    ", only production mechanism possible for the scalar-@xmath4 is the photon - photon fusion where the photons in the initial state arises either as a parton in side the proton or proton being electrically charged , radiated from it . though parton density of photon is usually small and photon radiation probability is suppressed by the form factors , the large loop induced @xmath3 coupling could give rise to significant production cross - section at the lhc and hence , di - photon being the dominant decay channel , @xmath4 could explain the lhc observed excess of di - photon events at 750 gev invariant mass .",
    "the model has several interesting predictions , such as other observable modes with cross section at the few @xmath5 level are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , while the contribution to di - jet and @xmath9 modes are very small .",
    "we also emphasize the model can explain both the 750 gev di - photon rate , as well as the tiny neutrino masses .",
    "our model is based on the sm symmetry group @xmath10 . in the fermion sector ,",
    "in addition to the sm fermions , we add two vector - like @xmath11 triplet leptons , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the scalar sector , in addition to the usual sm higgs doublet , @xmath14 , we introduce an isospin @xmath0 scalar , @xmath2 , and and an electroweak ( ew ) singlet , @xmath4 .",
    "the particle contents along with their quantum numbers are shown in the table  [ table1 ] below .",
    "+    .matter , gauge and higgs contents of the model . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented new model for the recent di - photon excess at the lhc .",
    "the uniqueness of the model is that it can explain not only the diphoton excess , but also generate tiny neutrino masses via the see - saw mechanism at the tev scale .",
    "another uniqueness of the model is that the diphoton excess is generated by the two photon induced subprocess .",
    "the model has a sm singlet scalar which is the diphoton resonance , and a weak isospin @xmath0 scalar with multiply charged particles circulating in the loop for the production as well as the decay .",
    "the model satisfies all the constraints associated with the diphoton events .",
    "it also predicts the other observable final states to be @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 and almost no dijet resonance and very tiny cross sections for @xmath9 .",
    "all these predictions can be tested in the upcoming runs with higher luminosity at the lhc .",
