    "the existence of phase diagrams depending on the strength of the substrate potential in a lattice gas model for multilayer adsorption , have been shown by benyoussef and ez - zahraouy [ 5 ] .",
    "the wetting and layering transitions are caused by the competition between short - ranged attractions and long - ranged repulsions in systems like langmuir monolayers and adsorbed monolayers [ 6 ] .",
    "these transitions have also been found , under the effect of the geometry of the system , in the case of the double wedge wetting [ 7 ] in magnetic films , and the wetting behavior of associating binary mixtures at attractive walls [ 8 ] .",
    "we showed recently , in ref . [ 9 ] , the existence of these transitions under the effect of the surface coupling , when using the mean field theory .",
    "+ on the other hand , many recent studies showed that indirect interactions can lead to the formation of nano - structures at surfaces [ 10 ] mediated by the structure and the geometry of the film .",
    "monte carlo simulations [ 11 ] and subsequently derived mean field theories [ 12 ] , showed the existence of higher island densities than those expected by standard nucleation theory .",
    "it is shown that several experimental works , e.g. [ 13 ] , supports these predictions , such as the deposition of @xmath5 on mica substrates at a high temperature [ 14 ] . + a small variation of the preparation conditions may considerably change the obtained magnetic structure and allows the investigation of atomic structure as well as the magnetic domain structure of several nanostructured systems [ 15,16 ] .",
    "however , lenz and lipowski [ 17 ] showed that the morphology of wetting layers on structured surfaces is determined by the geometry of the underlying surface domains , and that the wetting layer exhibits several distinct morphologies .",
    "+   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   + our aim in this work is to study the effect of the inhomogeneity of substrate on the wetting transitions of a spin-@xmath0 ising film when a surface magnetic field is applied on alternate clusters of the surface .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath6",
    ", we describe the model and the method used : monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . in section",
    "@xmath7 we present results and discussions .",
    "+   +   +   +   +   +   + the system we are studying , illustrated by fig .",
    "1 , is a magnetic thin film formed with @xmath8 layers coupled ferromagnetically .",
    "each layer is a square of dimension @xmath9 spins . @xmath10 and @xmath11 stand for the number of spins in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions , respectively .",
    "a surface magnetic field @xmath2 is acting only on alternate clusters of spins of the surface @xmath14 .",
    "this is represented , in fig . 1 , by symbols",
    "@xmath15 for alternate clusters of dimension @xmath16 .",
    "whereas @xmath2 is absent for the remaining alternate clusters of dimension @xmath17 .",
    "these clusters are represented by symbols @xmath18 .",
    "+ the hamiltonian governing this system is given by @xmath19 where , @xmath20 are the random spin variables and +   +   +   +   + the surface magnetic field @xmath21 , is applied only on sites @xmath22 of the surface @xmath14 , and distributed alternatively , : @xmath23 +   +   + @xmath24,\\ ] ] +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   + a preliminary study showed that the topologies of the phase diagrams are similar ( with different numerical values ) when the film thickness varies from @xmath25 , when the number of spins of each layer varies from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ; where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number , of spins of each layer , in the @xmath12 and @xmath28directions , respectively . +   + taking into account the above considerations we give numerical results in this paper for a film with @xmath8 layers and @xmath27 spins for each layer .",
    "we mean by an island , a set of negative spins surrounded by positive ones . in all the following , our interest will be concentrated on the mean size of islands ( msi ) and the average number of islands ( ani ) .",
    "the different phases are determined by values of the average number of islands and their mean sizes as following : + * the pwtd phase is characterized by : @xmath29 and @xmath30 . + * the pwpd phase is present for : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "+ * the pwtc phase corresponds to : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "+ however , in the particular case of the non wet phase , we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( which is the total number of spins of each layer ) .",
    "we note that in this particular case , although positive spins are completely absent in the layer , we assume that this situation corresponds to a unique island .",
    "a sketch of the geometry of the system we are studying , is presented in fig .",
    "1 . in order to outline the behaviour of the as a function of the external magnetic field , we plot in figs . 2a and 2b , these parameters , for a surface magnetic field @xmath37 and a temperature @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "2a corresponds to the surface @xmath14 , whereas fig .",
    "2b is plotted for the last layer @xmath39 .",
    "it is found that , for the surface @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "2a ) and the last layer @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "2b ) , when decreasing the external magnetic field from @xmath41 , exhibits two islands for @xmath42 , with a rapid increasing of the number of negative spins in each layer , as it is illustrated by curve . for @xmath38 and @xmath43 , the increases rapidly and the undergoes a local maximum",
    "when decreasing the magnetic field @xmath1 so that @xmath44 the average number of islands of the surface stabilizes at @xmath45 , whereas it drops suddenly to one cluster formed with negative spins , in the case of the last layer @xmath40 . in the case of the surface ,",
    "the undergoes a large local plateau corresponding to the value @xmath46 , followed by the apparition of a unique island for @xmath47 .",
    "this scenario is absent in the case of the last layer @xmath40 , fig .",
    "2b , where the islands are rapidly connected to each other for @xmath48 .",
    "on the other hand , the increasing surface magnetic field effect , on island formation is illustrated by figs .",
    "3a and 3b for a fixed temperature @xmath38 for several values of the surface magnetic field : @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , for small values of the external magnetic field , @xmath51 , the increasing surface magnetic field @xmath2 is not felt at this `` higher '' temperature value @xmath52 . while , for @xmath44 , the increasing surface magnetic field amplitude is to produce a large step of mean size island value @xmath46 , see fig .",
    "it is worth to note that this step disappears for very small surface magnetic field values . concerning the average number islands ( ani ) , the same arguments still valid when increasing the surface magnetic field amplitude @xmath2 , fig .",
    "the islands are rapidly connected to each other for very small values of @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the existence of three regions of island configurations in the plane @xmath53 , for @xmath40 and a fixed surface magnetic field @xmath50 .",
    "these three different regions are : the totally wet ( tw ) region , the no wet region ( nw ) and the partially wet region . in the latter case , see in fig .",
    "4 , the existence of three distinct island configurations , namely ; the ( pwtd ) configurations where the layer is partially wet with a total disconnection of the islands ; the ( pwpd ) configurations in which the layer is partially wet with a partial disconnection of the islands ; the ( pwtc ) configurations corresponding to a partially wet layer with totally connected clusters .",
    "indeed , at low temperature values , only the totally wet ( tw ) phase for @xmath54 , and the non wet ( nw ) phase for @xmath55 are present . at higher temperature values ,",
    "provided that @xmath3 is kept less than the critical value @xmath56 , the partially wet phase occurs .",
    "starting from the totally wet phase ( tw ) , present for positive values of @xmath1 , the decreasing of the external magnetic field ( from @xmath57 to negative values ) , gives rise to the phase ( pwtd ) showing totally disconnected configuration of islands .",
    "this phase is followed by the ( pwpd ) phase in which the configuration of islands are partially disconnected when @xmath43 . for @xmath58",
    ", the partially wet phase ( pwtc ) where the islands are totally connected to each other , is reached . decreasing the magnetic field",
    "@xmath1 more and more , the non wet phase @xmath59 is found and persists for @xmath60 .",
    "+   +   +   +   + in order to more clarify these findings , we plot in figs . 5a and 5b , different island configurations in different regions of the phase diagram for the different layers of the film .",
    "+ indeed , fig .",
    "5a , shows that , for @xmath50 , @xmath38 and @xmath61 , the first layer @xmath14 + ( pwtc ) .",
    "the second layer @xmath62 belongs to ( pwpd ) , whereas the third layer @xmath63 is in the ( pwtd ) .",
    "on the other hand , when maintaining the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 constant , and varying only the external magnetic field , a given layer undergoes different configurations belonging to different regions : totally connected ( pwtc ) , partially disconnected ( pwpd ) and totally disconnected ( pwtd ) .",
    "this situation is illustrated by fig .",
    "5b for the last layer @xmath64 . indeed , for @xmath61 this layer is in the ( pwtc ) .",
    "for @xmath65 the configuration of this layer ( pwpd ) ; and when @xmath66 the islands of this layers are completely disconnected from each other so that this configuration belongs to ( pwtd ) region .",
    "the numerical values given in this work correspond to @xmath27 .",
    "however , a preliminary study showed that when @xmath67 and @xmath38 the partially disconnected region ( pwpd ) is located in the interval @xmath68 .",
    "hence , the finite size effect and thermodynamic limit is to enlarge partially wetting regions ( pw ) .",
    "moreover , the formation of islands in each layer leads to the formation of the three dimensional islands ( @xmath4-islands ) .",
    "the superposition of these @xmath69-island of adjacent layers leads to the formation of such @xmath4-islands in the film .",
    "for example , fig.5a shows these @xmath4-islands , when superposing the layers @xmath70 over each other .",
    "this situation is more outlined , for example , in the rectangle of coordinates in the rectangle @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the layers @xmath70 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the superposition of these islands constitute a three dimensional island in the bulk of the film .",
    "however , the height of the formed islands depends on the values of temperature , surface and external magnetic fields . in the example of fig .",
    "5a , some island heights are close to 4 .",
    "a preliminary study showed that the island height decreases with decreasing values of @xmath2 , for fixed values of temperature @xmath3 and external magnetic field @xmath1 . to complete this study , the frequency distribution of different configurations ,",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "6 . this figure shows the corresponding frequency island size distributions , for the totally disconnected region ( pwtd ) , for the layers @xmath14 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 when the temperature is fixed at @xmath38 , the surface magnetic field is @xmath50 and @xmath74 .",
    "the different scenarios presented by the system concerning the inhomogeneity substrate effect on the distribution of cluster sizes and number of existing clusters are presented .",
    "indeed , the mean size cluster of negative spins undergoes a local maximum before exhibiting first and second steps . the plateau of the first step increases with increasing surface magnetic field values .",
    "we have studied the effect of the inhomogeneity of a substrate on the wetting transitions of a spin-@xmath0 ferromagnetic ising thin film under the effect of an alternate surface magnetic field @xmath2 acting on alternate clusters of the surface , using monte carlo simulations . in the partial wetting region",
    "each layer exhibits three different configurations namely : partial wetting with totally disconnected cluster ( pwtd ) , partial wetting with partially disconnected clusters ( pwpd ) and partial wetting with totally connected clusters ( pwtc ) . on the other hand",
    ", we found that increasing the surface magnetic field leads to the disconnection of some connected clusters in the ( pwpd ) region .",
    "furthermore the @xmath4-islands occur for strong surface magnetic field values",
    ". moreover , the distributions of the cluster size , in each layer of the film , are also computed .",
