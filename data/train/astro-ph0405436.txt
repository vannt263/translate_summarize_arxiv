    "evidence for a radio jet was first detected between april 1984 and may 1985 , coincident with a strong radio outburst and a substantial decline in the visual magnitude @xcite .",
    "subsequent radio and optical observations confirmed the extended emission as arising from a jet @xcite , and also revealed that the jet position angle on the sky changes with time , suggesting that the jet axis precesses with a period of @xmath3  d @xcite .",
    "changes in the fast optical flickering in 1997 , after a jet was produced , have also suggested a direct connection between the accretion disk and jet production in ch cyg @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission was first conclusively detected from ch cyg by _ exosat _ on 1985 may 24 , at a flux of @xmath4 ( 0.022.5  kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent _ asca _ observations revealed a complex x - ray spectrum which could be fit either with multiple thermal components @xcite or a single - temperature thermal spectrum attenuated by an ionized absorber @xcite .",
    "here we describe analysis of a _",
    "observation in which we detect , for the first time , the x - ray jet in ch  cyg .",
    "we analyzed an observation of ch  cyg  acquired between 2001 march 27 06:22 and 20:02 ut , by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the observation was made in timed / faint mode with the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) in place , although the source flux was too low to obtain a high signal - to - noise grating spectrum ( the first - order count rate was @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus , we did not consider the dispersed spectra for our analysis .",
    "the ccds are sensitive to photons in the 0.210  kev energy range , and have a pixel size of @xmath6 .",
    "the zeroth - order image fell on the s3 ( backside - illuminated ) chip of the acis - s array .",

    "we measured the radial surface brightness profile of the simulated zeroth - order image , and the resulting point - spread function is shown as a grey ribbon in fig .",
    "[ radial ] .",
    "we also measured the observed radial profile of ch  cyg , both in the southern region where the source is extended , and over the rest of the image excluding this region ( see fig . [ jet ] ) .",
    "the extension we observed in the binned zeroth - order image ( fig . [ jet ] ) is apparent as an excess above the radial surface brightness profiles of both the simulated image and the non - southern directions of the observed images .",
    "we extracted 43 photons from the extended southern region , excluding photons within @xmath17 of the centroid position .",
    "the probability of observing this many photons , given the extent of the simulated point source and assuming poisson statistics , is @xmath18 , corresponding to a significance of @xmath19 .",
    "the position angle of the extended emission ( measured anticlockwise through east from north ) of the principal component of the photon distribution was @xmath20 , consistent with contemporary measurements of the ch  cyg  jet from vla / merlin radio and hst optical measurements @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the extension observed in the _ chandra _ image is due to x - ray emission from the jet in ch  cyg .",

    "we found an acceptable fit with a c - statistic ( appropriate for low - count per bin regimes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of 4.0 , below which fell only 6% of 1000 monte - carlo simulated spectra .",
    "extrapolating this model beyond the _ chandra _ energy limits , we estimate an unabsorbed bolometric flux of @xmath28 , giving a jet luminosity of @xmath29 .",
    "we also fit the total zeroth - order spectrum , taking photons from within a circle of radius @xmath30 around the centroid position .",
    "we used photons from an annulus 5@xmath31 from the centroid position as background .",
    "the spectrum exhibited two broad peaks , around 1 and 5 kev , as well as a narrow 6.64  kev line ( fig .",
    "[ spectral ] ) , similar to the earlier asca observation @xcite .",

    "53% of 1000 monte - carlo spectral simulations gave a lower value , indicating a statistically acceptable fit .",
    "the spectral parameters were roughly consistent with the asca values . by extrapolating this plasma - model spectrum beyond the _ chandra _ energy limits , we derive an intrinsic ( neglecting line - of - sight absorption ) bolometric flux of @xmath4 , giving a luminosity of @xmath32 ( for a distance of 245  pc ) . this luminosity is more than an order of magnitude smaller than typical values from earlier x - ray measurements of ch  cyg(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "the extended x - ray emission in ch  cyg  can be naturally explained by the collision of a collimated outflow of material with surrounding nebular gas .",
    "outflow velocities for ch  cyg  have been estimated as 600@xmath33 and @xmath34 in 1984/1985 ( @xcite and references therein , and @xcite respectively ) , and @xmath35 in 1998 - 2000 @xcite . for a typical outflow velocity of @xmath36 ,",
    "the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions give @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the shock velocity and @xmath39 is the flow speed in the jet ) for a strong shock .",
    "the temperature behind the shock , @xmath40 , would then be @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath43 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath44 is the proton mass , and we have assumed that the gas is ideal .",
    "a plasma with a post - shock temperature of @xmath45  k produces x - rays in the 4 - 5 kev range ; although we have insufficient jet x - ray photons to perform formal spectral fitting , we detect x - ray - jet photons at these energies . the data are thus consistent with material heated in a strong shock .",
    "softer x - ray photons are also detected from the jet .",
    "the time scale for hot plasma to adiabatically cool by flowing out from behind the shock is given roughly by the width of the jet divided by the sound speed .",
    "for the jet parameters of ch  cyg , this time is a few months .",
    "thus , the lower - temperature jet emission ( photons around 1 kev ) could be due to material that has expanded perpendicular to the flow of the jet .",
    "alternatively , a range of temperatures could arise from multiple shocks in the jet .    adopting @xmath46 and a jet size of @xmath13 on 2001 march 27",
    ", we can estimate the epoch of jet production . for @xmath47  pc ,",
    "we derive a mean proper motion for the jet of @xmath48 .",
    "the extended @xmath49 emission is therefore consistent with having been produced by material that was ejected in mid-1998 . at that time , ch  cyg  underwent a transition into an optical high state ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of extended radio emission in 1995 by @xcite suggests that a      jet ejection also occurred in association with a transition to the optical high state in 1992 .",
    "the other two jet ejections , in 1984/85 @xcite and 1997 @xcite , were associated with transitions from high to low optical states .",
    "thus there appear to be at least two different scenarios in which jets can be produced in ch  cyg .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of x - ray binaries , which can produce discrete ejections in association with x - ray state changes , possibly in response to an extreme physical change in the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the only other symbiotic star currently known to have an x - ray jet is r  aqr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "compared to ch  cyg the r  aqr jet is both more extended on the sky ( @xmath50 for the r aqr southern jet compared to @xmath13 for ch  cyg ) and physically larger ( roughly 6000  au compared to roughly 1000  au for ch  cyg ) .",
    "although the measured jet fluxes for the two sources are comparable , @xcite found that few of the jet x - ray photons from r  aqr had energies greater than 1 kev .",
    "the r  aqr jet spectrum revealed emission lines at 400 and 550 ev and was generally consistent with a shocked plasma out of ionization equilibrium ( the plasma temperatures for the northeastern and southwestern jets were found to be @xmath51 k and @xmath52 k respectively ) .",
    "a follow - up _ chandra _ observation of r  aqr revealed that the northern r  aqr x - ray jet is expanding at a velocity of @xmath53 ( e. kellogg , private communication ) .",
    "@xcite compiled and modeled the full spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of r  aqr , and found that the jet emission is due to a combination of photoionization and shock heating . in units of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is radiation frequency and @xmath56 is flux density , the r  aqr jet emission is strongest in the uv , weakest in the radio , and in between for the x - rays . in fig .",
    "[ sed ] we plot both the sed data compiled for r  aqr by @xcite and that for ch  cyg  obtained from the literature and our work in the x - rays .",
    "the jet seds for r  aqr and ch  cygare quite similar , despite r  aqr appearing to have a slower shock speed , slightly lower post - shock temperatures , and a larger size .",
    "this similarity suggests that other symbiotic - star jets might also be expected to emit x - rays .",
    "in addition to symbiotic - star jets , two other types of non - relativistic jet have been detected in the x - rays : protostellar jets ( in herbig - haro objects ) and collimated outflows from the central stars or binaries in planetary nebulae ( pne ) . in both cases",
    ", the x - rays also appear to be due to shock heating as the outflowing material collides with surrounding gas .",
    "in the two known x - ray - bright protostellar outflows ( hh2 , @xcite ; and yl1551  irs5 = hh  154 , @xcite ) , the jet x - ray luminosities are a few times @xmath57 ergs ( similar to ch  cyg  and r aqr ) and the jet plasma temperatures are @xmath58 k. @xcite summarized six observations of pne by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , four of which revealed diffuse x - ray emission with temperatures of a few time @xmath59 k. these four pne all show evidence for high - velocity , collimated flows @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that a hidden binary companion within each of these pne accrete from the agb - star wind and produce an x - ray jet .",
    "they note that the x - ray production mechanism would thus be similar to that in the protostellar outflows mentioned above , and the symbiotic star r  aqr .",
    "in fact , an additional pne with x - ray - jet emission , menzel 3 , is known to contain a symbiotic pair at its center @xcite .",
    "the links between the x - ray jets in symbiotic stars , protostellar outflows , and pne are thus quite compelling .",
