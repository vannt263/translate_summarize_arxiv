    "it has become increasingly clear that the growth of central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and their host spheroids are closely related since the mass of the smbh correlates well with the properties of the hot stellar component of the host galaxy , e.g. the galactic velocity dispersion ( @xmath7-@xmath8 ) , the luminosity / mass of the spheroidal component of the host galaxy ( e.g. magorrian et al .",

    "in contrast , the @xmath104 values for local classical qsos and high - redshift bright qsos are almost an order of magnitude larger than the local @xmath110 value . for these objects , the central smbh masses increase much faster than their host spheroids compared to the local scaling .",
    "it is interesting to note that the four relatively faint high - redshift co detected qsos ( smm 04135 , f 10214 , cloverleaf and rxj 124913 ) have high @xmath102 values that are close to or even larger than those of local ir qsos , thus the growth of their black hole may be slower than that of high - luminosity qsos .    according to the scenario first pointed out by sanders et al .",

    "the different efficiencies of gas accretion to central smbh ( @xmath99 ) between the ir qsos and local classical qsos and the high - redshift brightest qsos then fit well into a picture where the qso luminosity reaches the maximum when the star formation at the central @xmath6 kpc decreases to a few tenths of its peak value and no longer dominates the energy output ( as indicated by the @xmath112 value ) .",
    "such an evolutionary path has also been discussed for agns in smgs by alexander ( 2009 ) and is broadly consistent with the simulation results of hopkins ( 2011 ) .",

    "<S> this suggests that , similar to ulirgs , the far - infrared emissions of all qsos are mainly from dust heated by star formation rather than by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , confirming similar findings from mid - infrared spectroscopic observations by _ spitzer_. a correlation between the agn - associated bolometric luminosities and the co line luminosities suggests that star formation and agns draw from the same reservoir of gas and there is a link between star formation on @xmath6 kpc scale and the central black hole accretion process on much smaller scales . </S>"
