    "although it has been more than 80 years since the formulation of schrdinger s equation , there is still no black - box computationally efficient treatment of strong correlations in electronic structure theory .",
    "strong correlations , also known as static or non - dynamic correlations , appear from exact and near - degeneracies in the wave function that render the one - determinant hartree - fock ( hf ) picture qualitatively incorrect . by `` computationally efficient '' , we mean an effective one - electron theory with mean - field computational cost .",
    "of course , exact diagonalization of the molecular hamiltonian in the hilbert space of the problem ( a method known as full configuration interaction or fci ) includes all strong correlations but it is impractical except for the smallest systems because of its combinatorial computational cost .",
    "other high accuracy models involve at least @xmath0 computational effort , where @xmath1 is the number of orbitals .",
    "the method presented in this paper accomplishes the goal of being an effective one - electron theory with mean - field computational cost , accurately describing strong correlations ( and more ) of finite systems in a black - box manner .",
    "we derive and implement a wave function method named projected quasiparticle theory ( pqt ) based on symmetry - projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations .",
    "all symmetries ( particle number , spin , spatial , and complex conjugation ) are here deliberately broken and restored in a self - consistent approach .",
    "we start , that is , with a symmetry broken single slater determinant , and then restore the symmetry via projection to obtain a multi - determinantal wave function which is variationally superior .",
    "projection methods on a deformed ( _ i.e. _ broken symmetry ) hfb state have been used in nuclear physics for many years.@xcite unlike those used in quantum chemistry,@xcite these projections are based on the generator coordinate method.@xcite in particular , number projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb ) is perhaps most widely used because the attractive character of the nucleon - nucleon interaction usually leads to hfb solutions that have lower energy than hf . the work that we here present builds upon the number projection formalism of sheikh and ring.@xcite we expand and develop their technique to include many molecular symmetries",
    "not previously considered .",
    "phfb is a variational problem where a deformed quasiparticle determinant @xmath2 is optimized in the presence of projection operators @xmath3 which can represent a collection of symmetries .",
    "sheikh and ring@xcite realized that the energy arising from this minimization ( see below ) can be expressed as a functional of the hfb regular density matrix and anomalous density matrix .",
    "thus , this problem can be solved by diagonalization of an effective hamiltonian matrix . here , we extend their work and consider projections onto eigenfunctions of the particle number , spin rotation ( both @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , complex conjugation , and spatial symmetry operators .",
    "in essence , we here present a method where all symmetries in the molecular wave function@xcite may be _ deliberately _ broken and variationally restored .",
    "this includes both continuous ( infinite dimension ) such as spin rotation and discrete group representations such as spatial symmetry and complex conjugation ; the latter two had not been considered previously .",
    "the resulting mathematical problem of variation - after - projection ( vap ) seems formidable at first glance , yet as we show below , it can be converted into essentially one of diagonalization of an effective one - quasiparticle hamiltonian with mean - field computational cost .",
    "alternatives to the diagonalization approach that we pursue are discussed in the nuclear physics literature.@xcite",
    "the research presented here was motivated by recent work in our group . in a series of papers@xcite ,",
    "we have proposed constrained - pairing mean - field theory ( cpmft ) , a method for dealing with strong correlations . by introducing a fictitious attractive pairing interaction between electrons in an active space , cpmft accounts for strong correlations and",
    "properly dissociates molecules into fragments with correct spatial and spin symmetries .",
    "cpmft is black - box but does not have a wave function ; it is in practice a one - particle density matrix functional whose two - particle density matrix is not n - representable but whose energy can be optimized via an effective hfb diagonalization problem.@xcite hfb breaks particle number symmetry , so cpmft requires a chemical potential for controlling electron number .    in its singlet - paired version,@xcite cpmft is intimately connected with unrestricted hf ( uhf).@xcite its lagrange multipliers for constraining pairing interactions within an active space inspired the resolution of an old problem : how to obtain the rohf wave function within an uhf framework.@xcite this is essentially a constrained variation problem of spin - projection of an unrestricted determinant .",
    "we should note that in open - shell cases , spin symmetry breaking occurs spontaneously when using unrestricted orbitals .",
    "on the other hand , when dealing with singlet states , it does not matter if the restricted hf ( rhf ) wave function is stable or unstable ; in both cases the vap wave function originating from a uhf guess becomes multireference in nature .",
    "this is akin to `` deliberate '' symmetry breaking followed by a restoration step . in other words ,",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking ( due to so - called `` hf instabilities '' ) is not a necessary condition in vap schemes .",
    "curiously , cpmft can be interpreted as deliberate number symmetry breaking ( triggered by hfb with a fictitious attractive interaction ) , followed by a symmetry restoration step generated by its energy and two - particle density matrix definition.@xcite    the lessons learned with cpmft and our desire to develop a _ wave function _",
    "theory for strong correlations , steered us into projection schemes .",
    "number projected hfb ( also known as projected bardeen - cooper - schrieffer or pbcs ) is widely discussed in textbooks@xcite and yields the antisymmetrized geminal power ( agp ) wave function of quantum chemistry , a model that has been extensively studied.@xcite as shown here , projected hfb can be used not only to optimize agp wave functions with singlet geminals ( singlet pairing ) but also to optimize broken symmetry geminals which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been done before . when all symmetries are broken , the resulting projected wave function is of multireference character , one that permeates the entire hilbert space of the problem . by this , we mean that every slater determinant built from the natural orbitals of our broken symmetry determinant is allowed to overlap with our projected wave function .",
    "remarkably , the projected wave function accomplishes this feat with a linear number of parameters in an implicit factorization scheme driven by the variational principle .    viewed in their natural orbital basis ,",
    "closed - shell singlet - paired agp wave functions belong to the seniority zero sector of the hilbert space of the problem and suffer from known drawbacks.@xcite seniority is here defined as twice the number of broken electron pairs in a determinant ( _ i.e. _ , the number of singly occupied spatial orbitals ) . for more details about the seniority concept and its use in electronic structure theory , see ref . .",
    "spin projection on top of number projection forces the wave function to permeate to all seniority sectors . by deliberatively breaking spin symmetry and forcing @xmath6 and @xmath7 spatial orbitals to be different , all electron pairs are broken and spin contamination is introduced . in our case , however , spin projection operators in the hfb context restore the correct quantum numbers for uhf ( @xmath4 ) and generalized hf ( ghf ) ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) orbitals and density matrices . in ghf",
    "the spin orbitals are linear combinations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 spin , yielding a density matrix with all spin blocks populated ( usually referred to as noncollinear configuration ) .",
    "access to the triplet pairing channel is required if spin symmetry is to be broken and the broken symmetry wave function has hfb character.@xcite we note in passing that the spin projection method developed in this work provides a solution to the extended hartree - fock method of lwdin and mayer@xcite and goddard s gf method@xcite , albeit accomplished simultaneously with number projection .",
    "both number and spin projection operators ( or their generalization in the case of non - singlet spin ) can be written as integrals over gauge angles in the generator coordinate approach that we employ.@xcite the restoration of these symmetries is mathematically accomplished here via discretization of the gauge integral over modest size grids .",
    "the corresponding symmetries are u(1 ) for number and su(2 ) [ homeomorphic to so(3 ) ] for triaxial noncollinear spin - projection .",
    "restoration of discrete symmetries like point group ( space ) and complex conjugation yield wave functions that are linear combinations of the generalized agp wave functions discussed above .",
    "complex conjugation is an antiunitary symmetry@xcite and its restoration requires special consideration , as discussed below .",
    "the effective one - electron phfb hamiltonian includes both fock and pairing pieces that depend on transition density matrices that are defined over the gauge grid .",
    "these transition density matrices yield via gauge integration a correlated and factorizable two - particle density matrix .",
    "computationally , the most expensive step of phfb requires that the two - electron integrals be contracted with the transition density matrices at every grid point , so the computational scaling of this generalized form of phfb is comparable to the mean - field cost of single reference hf times the number of grid points , which we show below is fairly insensitive to the size of the system . depending on basis set , system size , and energy gap",
    ", this computational cost@xcite will be @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the entire myriad of linear scaling tools ( including alternatives to diagonalization ) is of course available to help further reduce this computational cost to @xmath10.@xcite the integration over grid points is trivially parallelizable .    remarkably , the phfb wave function presented in this work can be obtained with mean - field computational cost even though its multireference character permeates the entire fci space .",
    "the fundamental reason behind this feat resides in a projected energy expression that is of hfb form and can be solved for by a standard hfb diagonalization .    from a mathematical perspective",
    ", the results here obtained are supported by an implicit coherent state representation of non - orthogonal wave functions out of which the component of desired symmetry can be projected while simultaneously satisfying the variational principle.@xcite the class of multireference wave functions studied in this work , which can be written as a quasiparticle density matrix functional , have remained completely unexplored in electronic structure theory .",
    "the only previously known density matrix functional that has an accompanying wave function is hartree - fock .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the main equations of our method , deferring details to the appendix .",
    "a number of benchmark results are then presented and discussed followed by concluding remarks .",
    "fundamentally , our multireference wave functions are simply the result of projection from a broken symmetry quasiparticle determinant .",
    "we will provide a few necessary details of quasiparticle theory here ; the interested reader should consult one of the many textbooks available on the subject.@xcite the quasiparticle creation operators that we use are obtained by a bogoliubov - de gennes transformation of the standard electron creation and annihilation operators : @xmath11 a quasiparticle determinant can then be written as @xmath12 where @xmath1 is the dimension of the single - particle basis and @xmath13 is the empty state . note that this quasiparticle determinant dwells in fock space rather than in hilbert space . in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method ,",
    "one variationally minimizes the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 defining the quasiparticle orbitals .",
    "given the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 , one can form the hermitian density matrix @xmath16 and the antisymmetric anomalous density matrix @xmath17 we remind the reader that the _ unprojected _ hfb wave function converges to hf in cases where the two - body interaction is repulsive , as in electronic structure",
    ".    it may be instructive to write the hfb determinant in a slightly different manner .",
    "in the so - called hfb `` canonical '' ( natural orbital ) basis , the quasiparticle determinant is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a normalization factor and @xmath20 .",
    "the product runs over the @xmath21 orbitals defining the subspace over which the hfb wave function is allowed .",
    "usually , @xmath22 , but this is not always the case . indeed , if @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of electrons , then the number projected hfb corresponds exactly to hf . note that @xmath21 is known in the agp literature as the _ rank _ of the geminal . in writing eqn .",
    "[ eqn : agp ] , we have used the indices @xmath25 and @xmath26 to represent the orbitals that are paired .",
    "typically the paired orbitals are chosen to be @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the two spin orbitals formed from the same spatial orbital . when this is so , the projected hfb wave function is manifestly of seniority zero .",
    "however , one can choose to pair orbitals differently , a point to which we shall return later .    from the form of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : agp ] it is clear that the hfb determinant contains contributions from states of many different particle numbers , and that for each particle number , number projection of hfb yields a linear combination of many determinants . in fact , when @xmath29 the number projected unrestricted hfb yields a linear combination of _ every _ determinant , which is what we mean when we say that the projected hfb wave function permeates hilbert space . pairing the spatial orbitals @xmath27 and @xmath28 instead yields a projected hfb wave function which is a linear combination of every determinant of seniority zero . in either case , each determinant has its own coefficient , but those coefficients are determined by the hfb parameters @xmath30 . in other words",
    "the coefficients of the different determinants are factorized .",
    "approximate wave functions such as quasiparticle determinants need not possess the same symmetries as the exact solutions .",
    "in fact , constraining the variationally optimized state to preserve certain symmetries can only lead to higher energy solutions as this reduces the variational manifold , a fact now known as lwdin s _ symmetry dilemma_.@xcite    projection operators can be used to restore symmetries of the hamiltonian from a broken - symmetry approximate wave function , thus avoiding the symmetry dilemma .",
    "one can use the projection operators in two ways :    * in the projection - after - variation ( pav ) scheme , one optimizes a broken symmetry wave function , and then performs a single - shot symmetry restoration with the projection operator . * in the variation - after - projection ( vap ) scheme , the optimization is carried out in the presence of the projection operator .",
    "that is , one minimizes the expectation value of the projected wave function with respect to variations of the underlying deformed state .    in most cases",
    "vap is preferred since it uses all the variational flexibility available and avoids the artifactual phase transitions associated with symmetry breaking of the underlying wave function , which may become more pronounced when using the pav scheme.@xcite nonetheless , carrying out the full variational optimization with the vap scheme may lead to equations that become significantly more involved than solving the original variational problem.@xcite in finite systems , quantum fluctuations incorporated in the vap scheme lead to multireference wave functions that remove all artifactual phase transitions due to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this will be clear in the dissociation curves presented below .",
    "we note in passing that in the thermodynamic limit ( _ infinite _ systems ) , vap and pav based on a mean - field state do not improve the energy over that of the broken symmetry mean - field solution.@xcite the focus of this paper is on finite systems only .    in the special case when the deformed state is a quasiparticle determinant ,",
    "it turns out that the vap equations , though involved , can be solved in a straightforward manner .",
    "the nuclear physics literature contains a large number of _ approximate _",
    "solutions.@xcite exact solutions to certain specific vap problems in nuclear physics have also been discussed@xcite but not always fully implemented .",
    "the projection operators employed here are based on the generator coordinate method@xcite and are very different from the traditional approach in quantum chemistry due to lwdin.@xcite we note that the `` variation after mean field projection in realistic model spaces '' of schmid and collaborators share common features with out formalism , though the authors do not optimize the projected hfb state via diagonalization of a hermitian matrix as we do.@xcite to the best of our knowledge , projection methods have been applied to the electronic problem only twice,@xcite and then only with model hamiltonians .    given a hermitian operator @xmath31 which commutes with the hamiltonian , we can choose eigenfunctions of an approximate hamiltonian such as hf or hfb to also be eigenfunctions of @xmath31 .",
    "if we break @xmath31-symmetry ( that is , if our wave function is chosen to not be an eigenfunction of @xmath31 ) , we can construct a corresponding unitary operator @xmath32 with parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath33 is a gauge angle over which we will integrate and @xmath34 is the desired eigenvalue of @xmath31 .",
    "integration over @xmath33 will then yield a projection operator @xmath3 which projects eigenstates of @xmath31 with eigenvalue @xmath34 out of the the symmetry - broken wave function , provided that all eigenvalues of @xmath31 are rational .",
    "we sketch the main ideas below for particle number projection as an example .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 is a quasiparticle determinant . as a quasiparticle determinant ,",
    "it is completely specified by its density matrix @xmath36 and anomalous density matrix @xmath37 , and is a linear combination of particle number eigenstates :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the number operator .",
    "we emphasize that the number eigenstates @xmath40 are _ multideterminantal wave functions _ rather than being single determinants .",
    "then consider the unitary operator @xmath41 .",
    "its action on @xmath35 is to produce other quasiparticle determinants : @xmath42 we can project out the component @xmath43 with particle number @xmath44 by multiplying by the weight function @xmath45 and integrating .",
    "that is , @xmath46 we will write @xmath47 which is the projection operator onto the number eigenstate of interest .",
    "now , the energy we wish to minimize is simply @xmath48 where we have used the fact that @xmath49 is hermitian , idempotent , and commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "the matrix elements in the numerator and denominator can be , in principle , expressed entirely in terms of the projection operator and the density matrices @xmath36 and @xmath37 associated with @xmath35 .",
    "we then simply minimize @xmath50 with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath37 subject to the constraint that they are compatible with a quasiparticle determinant , and the result defines the vap energy and wave function .",
    "projections onto eigenstates of other operators follow a qualitatively similar pattern , though with significant differences in the details .",
    "in general , given a hermitian constant of motion ( symmetry ) , it is always possible to construct a unitary operator like that in eqn .",

    "the interested reader is referred to one of the textbooks in the field.@xcite      here we wish to briefly review the projection operators we will use .",
    "we wish to take a fairly general form , to make what follows as transparent as possible .    when the generators in which we are interested are continuous , the projection operators we consider can be expressed as @xmath51 where we wish to project onto the @xmath52 eigenstate of the operator @xmath53 .",
    "the precise form of the weight @xmath54 depends on the operator @xmath53 and also on the eigenstate @xmath55 .",
    "the rotation operator @xmath56 similarly depends on the symmetry operator @xmath53 .",
    "if the generator is instead discrete , the integration is replaced by a summation .",
    "the rotation operator @xmath56 acts on a deformed or broken symmetry state in such a way that    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and where @xmath59 commutes with @xmath53 and thus with @xmath56 .",
    "in other words , @xmath56 acts on the deformed state , preserving the norm and matrix elements of commuting observables up to an overall phase factor . typically , @xmath56 will be unitary , but it may instead be antiunitary .",
    "we point out that the rotated states form a nonorthogonal set that can be overcomplete , in the same manner as are coherent states .",
    "in fact , as we have already noted , the success of this approach is based on an underlying coherent state representation.@xcite    in this paper we will consider four types of projection operators associated with particle number , spin rotation , point group symmetry , and complex conjugation .",

    "we refer the reader to the exposition of the angular momentum projection operators in ref . .",
    "note that if the underlying reference state is an eigenfunction of @xmath68 ( a collinear state ) , as is usually the case , then the integrations over @xmath6 and @xmath75 are trivial and the projection operator becomes @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is wigner s small d - matrix.@xcite note also that in restoring invariance to the axis of spin quantization we also force the wave function to be an eigenfunction of @xmath67 .",
