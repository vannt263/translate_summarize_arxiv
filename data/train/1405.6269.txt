    "bok globules are the most suitable sites for studying the evolution and formation of isolated low mass stars @xcite .",
    "aligned dust grains in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the bok globule polarize the radiation through dichroic extinction . the grains are aligned with their short axis preferentially aligned with the local magnetic field , resulting in a polarization parallel to the field , as projected onto the plane of the sky ( lazarian et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "optical polarimetric observations of dark cloud can give information about the magnetic field orientation in the low density edge regions of clouds , whereas the polarimetric observation in the infrared and submillimetre range can map the field orientation in the higher density central regions of the clouds .",
    "thus the resulting polarization map outlines the geometry of the magnetic field lines projected onto the plane of the sky , which in turn helps to study the relationship between structure kinematics , and embedded magnetic field during various stages of star formation ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , vrba , coyne & tapia ( 1981 ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite modeled the observed variation in polarization with extinction along different lines of sight , in terms of a magnetic field with distinct random and uniform components .",
    "@xcite argued that most of the observed fall - off in @xmath7 is due to the turbulence of the magnetic field in the medium .",
    "@xcite predicted that @xmath8 @xmath9 a@xmath10 , which is closed to the observed dependence .",
    "it has been investigated later that jones model may not be applicable to individual clouds .",
    "@xcite studied the dust grain alignment in the taurus dark cloud ( tdc ) and showed a strong systematic trend in polarization efficiency with extinction which can be expressed by a power law @xmath8 @xmath9 a@xmath11 , in the magnitude region ( 0 @xmath12 25 ) .",
    "they explained this phenomenon of decrease in polarization with increase in extinction by considering a number of factors ( poor grain alignment , grain growth , and or changes in grain shape or composition ) .",
    "@xcite also did a detailed study of interstellar polarization efficiency toward molecular clouds to understand the grain alignment mechanism in different regions of interstellar medium .",
    "they studied the dependence of polarization efficiency on visual extinction by probing background field stars , and found that this dependency can be well expressed by a power law @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the optical depth ) .",
    "@xcite also showed that , among all the available grain alignment models , the radiative torque mechanism could more efficiently explain the observed polarization in the quiescent regions of the cloud .",
    "in this work , we have probed cb56 , cb60 and cb69 at the v - band , with a scientific goal to measure the optical polarization of the stars background to the globules and to map the magnetic fields within these globules .",
    "the extinction of field stars in each cloud are estimated using a standard technique suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the extinction of each field stars in the cloud and background star polarization will help to understand the dynamical behavior of the cloud .",
    "some works on cloud cb56 and cb60 were reported by a few investigators .",
    "both near infrared imaging and millimetre dust emission of cb60 were studied by @xcite and @xcite respectively and found that it is about 1500 parsec(pc ) away from the sun . @xcite",
    "also studied the millimetre dust emission of cb69 and reported a distance of 500pc .",
    "this is only marginally smaller than the distance of 600 pc derived by @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite mapped the magnetic fields within cb56 at r - band .",
    "this article is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the observational procedures and details of the data reduction techniques are discussed in section 3 .",

    "polarimetric observation of three bok globules cb56 , cb60 and cb69 , have been made at the v - band with exposure time of 900 seconds , using 2-m telescope of girawali observatory at inter university center for astronomy and astrophysics ( iucaa ) , pune ( igo , latitude : 19@xmath165@xmath17 n , longitude : + 73@xmath1640@xmath17 e , altitude = 1000 m ) , india on 4th and 5th march , 2011 .",

    "1 , 3 , 7 , 12 , 13 and 17 have @xmath30 , so they may be considered to be located background of the cloud .",
    "however , the @xmath18 of stars with serial no . 2 , 4 , 8 , 10,and 11 , lies within @xmath25 and @xmath26 , so they may be either within the cloud or located background to the cloud .",

    "@xcite have probed 248 small molecular clouds ( mostly bok globules ) , using deep iras photometry and @xmath34co spectroscopy . comparing their co peak line temperature and co line width",
    "they have divided those clouds into three types a , b , and c. the a type cloud contains the maximum number of clouds ( 74@xmath35 of 248 clouds ) where gas temperature are cool ( @xmath368.5k ) and with little turbulent gas motion .",
    "the b type cloud has unusually warm temperature , but with narrow line width and the c type cloud has quite a broad line width , implying unusual dynamic activity , whereas the gas temperature are cool .",
    "it is observed from @xcite that cloud cb56 and cb69 are identified as a type cloud , and cb60 as b type cloud .",
    "figures 5a5f represent the distribution of _ p _ and @xmath37 in the v - band , for the field stars observed in the bok globules : cb56 , cb60 and cb69 .",
    "cloud cb56 has two iras sources ( 07125 - 2503 ; 07125 - 2507 ) where its major axis has a position angle of 170@xmath38 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mean value for polarization and their position angle for the cb56 field stars are @xmath39 = 1.08@xmath40 , and @xmath41= 150.94@xmath42 with a standard deviation of @xmath43 = 0.56@xmath40 and @xmath44 = 10.09@xmath45 respectively .",
    "the polarization vector of most of the stars is aligned in a common direction which indicates the local magnetic field of the cloud . the alignment of polarization vectors in local magnetic field is quite expected as a type clouds show less dynamical activities and turbulence .",
    "thus , they have better alignment of the grains .",
    "it is further noticed from fig .",
    "1 that the direction of the local magnetic field of the cloud is almost parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "thus we can infer that the field direction in this cloud is similar to that of the galactic field .",
    "further , significant variation in the polarization value of star 18 ( please see table 4 ) from mean polarization value , suggests that it may be located either within the cloud or maybe located background to the cloud .",
    "it is worth mentioning that bvr magnitudes are not available for this star , so it is not possible to comment its location from photometry .    from figure [ fig2 ]",
    ", it can be seen that the polarization vectors in cb60 ( b - type cloud ) seem to be directed in some common direction of the local magnetic field of the cloud .",
    "the direction of local field ( @xmath46 ) is not aligned in the direction of gp ( 40@xmath38 ) which represents that the magnetic field within the cloud is different from the galactic field .",
    "also it is to be noted that b type cloud has some unusual warm temperature .",
    "it has three iras sources ( 08026 - 3122 ; 08029 - 3118 ; 08022 - 3155 ) ( @xcite ) . the average polarization and their position angle of the cb60 field stars are @xmath39 = 1.30@xmath40 , and @xmath41= 155.15@xmath42 with a standard deviation of @xmath43 = 0.94@xmath40 and @xmath44 = 10.67@xmath38 respectively .",
    "the polarization value of star 9 is unusually high from mean polarization value ( please see table 5 ) , which is also a known variable star v517 pup .",
    "it can be observed from figure [ fig3 ] that for the cloud cb69 ( a type cloud ) the polarization vectors are well aligned but the general direction is not along the direction of the gp ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this cloud has six iras sources ( 16594 - 3315 , 16595 - 3311 , 16586 - 3304 , 16589 - 3315 , 16590 - 3313 , 16590 - 3305 ) ( @xcite ) . the average polarization and their position angle of the cb60 field stars are @xmath39 = 2.00@xmath40 , and @xmath41= 155.8@xmath42 with a standard deviation of @xmath43 = 1.12@xmath40 and @xmath44 = 13.06@xmath38 respectively .",
    "the degree of linear polarization varies ( lower / higher ) depending on the location of the stars in the cloud .",
    "similar variation ( alignment / non - alignment ) of the polarization position angle with gp are generally observed depending on the membership of the stars ( i.e. foreground / background / within the cloud ) .",
    "thus , the efficiency of polarization depends on both , the properties of dust grain and on the environment in which they exist .",
    "so the study of variation of the background star polarization with extinction ( a@xmath21 ) and polarization efficiency ( defined as @xmath48/a@xmath21 ) , can help us in understanding the nature of the dust and the magnetic field associated with the dark cloud ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the alignment of non spherical dust grains are generally measured by the ratio of degree of polarization produced for a given amount of extinction ( @xmath20/a@xmath21 ) , also known as the _ polarization efficiency _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the linear polarization of 180 nearby stars in u , b , v and r bands where they studied the relation of the maximum polarization @xmath49 with the color excess @xmath18 at a wavelength @xmath50 , and found that the polarization efficiency along different line of sight varies within an upper limit : @xmath51/e(b - v)@xmath52 9.0 @xmath35 mag@xmath53 .",
    "@xcite calculated the theoretical upper limit of the polarization efficiency of the grains due to selective extinction which is @xmath52 14@xmath35 mag@xmath54 .",
