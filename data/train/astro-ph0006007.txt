    "a substantial basis of the galaxy formation theory has been founded by several pioneering works in 1970s ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the theory predicts that the galactic scales are basically determined by atomic cooling of hydrogen and partially helium .",
    "the pregalactic evolution is elegantly summarized on the _ cooling diagram _ for virialized objects .",
    "moreover , the origin of the hubble type has been attributed to the dissipativeness of the collapse , which is regulated by the efficiency of star formation .",
    "if the star formation proceeds after most of the gravitational energy is dissipated , the pregalactic clouds will evolve into spiral galaxies .",
    "this is a paradigm of the so - called _ dissipational galaxy formation _ ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , an early star formation episode leads to the _ dissipationless galaxy formation _ ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , ending up with the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , the key mechanism which physically controls the star formation efficiency has been hitherto unsolved .",
    "very recently , susa & umemura ( 2000 ) ( hereafter su ) propose that the self - shielding against uv background radiation regulates the star formation in pregalactic clouds .",
    "the star formation processes in primordial gas have been explored by many authors with _ ab initio _ calculations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the key physics is the radiative cooling by h@xmath0 line emission , because h@xmath0 is the only coolant for primordial gas at @xmath1 k. su have studied the efficiency of h@xmath0 cooling in collapsing clouds exposed to uv background radiation , because it is significant after the reionization of the universe , probably at @xmath2 ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "su have found that if a cloud undergoes the first sheet collapse at higher redshifts ( @xmath3 ) , then the cloud is quickly shielded against the uv background and consequently cools down due to the efficient formation of h@xmath0 .",
    "resultantly , it leads to an early burst of star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "the shielding is retarded for a later collapsing cloud at @xmath4 , resulting in the dissipational galaxy formation . as a result ,",
    "the bifurcation branch of the self - shielding is corresponding to the boundary between the dissipationless and dissipational galaxy formation . in this _ letter _",
    ", this novel bifurcation theory is confronted with the observations of elliptical and spiral galaxies to elucidate whether the theory is practically successful or not .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the bifurcation theory . here , the cosmological parameters are assumed to be @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 with usual meanings .",
    "originally , the sheet collapse was pursued with two initial parameters , i.e. , the mean density ( @xmath8 ) and the thickness ( @xmath9 ) . here",
    ", the initial parameter space is translated into the baryonic mass [ @xmath10 and the collapse epoch ( @xmath11 ) by assuming the initial stage is close to the maximum expansion of a density fluctuation . in the region ( a ) in figure 1 ,",
    "a pregalactic cloud is self - shielded against the external uv in the course of the sheet collapse , so that the cloud cools down below @xmath12k and undergoes efficient star formation .",
    "hence , it is expected to evolve into an early type galaxy with a large bulge - to - disk ratio ( b / d ) due to the dissipationless virialization . in the region ( b ) , the cloud is not self - shielded during the sheet collapse , but will be self - shielded through the shrink to the rotation barrier .",
    "this leads to the retarded star formation , and thus the virialization would proceed in a fairly dissipative fashion . as a result , a late type ( small b / d ) galaxy would be preferentially born .",
    "the region ( c ) represents the forbidden region of the collapse due to the jeans stability .",
    "su have considered only baryonic component , because , in the later collapsing phase , the cooling sheet is dominated by baryons , not by the diffuse dark matter .",
    "then , if the uv background is constant , the bifurcation mass scale is given as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the uv background intensity in units of @xmath15 . however , the dark matter potential may affect the evolution in the early phase of collapse .",
    "if we take this effect into account maximally , the jeans length is reduced by a factor of @xmath16 . with this jeans scale ,",
    "the bifurcation mass is changed to be @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the practical bifurcation mass would be between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "also , su have assumed the uv intensity to be independent of time .",
    "practically , the intensity seems to evolve .",
    "here we include the effect of the evolution of uv background radiation .",
    "we assume @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "this dependence is consistent with the uv intensity in the present epoch ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the value inferred from the qso proximity effects at high redshifts ( @xcite ; giallongo et al .",
    "1996 ) . as for @xmath24",
    ", two extreme models are employed .",
    "the first one is ( a ) the exponentially damping model , @xmath25 $ ] ( @xcite ) , and the second one is ( b ) the constant extrapolation model , @xmath26 . in figure [ fig1 ] , these two extreme models are shown .",
    "the difference emerges especially at @xmath27 .",
    "here , based upon the observational data , we attempt to assess the total baryonic masses of ellipticals as well as spirals and their collapse epochs . then , the observed galaxies are compared with the theory in the bifurcation diagram .    to begin with ,",
    "we evaluate the baryonic masses from b - band luminosities for ellipticals and from i - band luminosities for spirals with the mass - to - light ratio ; @xmath28l / f _ * ,   $ ] where @xmath29 is the total stellar mass and @xmath30 is the mass fraction of stellar component in the total baryonic mass . the mass - to - light ratios @xmath31 are obtained theoretically as well as observationally .",
    "based on the chemical evolution theory ( @xcite ) , the @xmath31 at b - band for ellipticals is @xmath32 .",
    "this value is consistent with the observational estimates of @xmath33 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the luminosity - dependent values given by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 at i - band for spirals is 3.37(sa ) , 2.91(sb ) , 1.79(sc ) , and 1.33(sd ) based on the code developed by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) with the s1 model in arimoto , yoshii , & takahara ( 1992 ) .",
    "these are also consistent with the observed data in rubin et al.(1985 ) .",
    "@xmath30 is theoretically calculated by the population synthesis model to be 0.963(sa ) , 0.908(sb ) , 0.462(sc ) , and 0.125(sd ) , while basically @xmath34 for ellipticals . with the estimated baryonic masses",
    ", we can assess the total masses as @xmath35 .",
    "next , we estimate the collapse epochs with the help of virial theorem . for the purpose",
    ", we use the observed 1-d velocity dispersion .",
    "we assume that the system is spherical and the dark halo has isothermal distributions after the virialization .",
    "we suppose a density perturbation as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the comoving radial coordinate and @xmath38 is a function which satisfies the normalization as @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being the comoving radius of the perturbed region .",
    "@xmath41 is the spatially averaged @xmath42 in the volume @xmath43 .",
    "summing up the initial kinetic energy and gravitational energy , we have the initial total energy of the perturbed region as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial redshift , @xmath46 is the contribution from the peculiar velocities , and @xmath47 is the total mass enclosed within the comoving radius @xmath40 .",
    "the factor @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 . in the linear regime ,",
    "@xmath51 around a density peak ( @xcite ) , where @xmath52 denotes the index of the cdm power spectrum .",
    "then equation ( [ eqn : defg2 ] ) is readily integrated to give @xmath53 .",
    "we assume @xmath54 throughout this paper , because it is the case for galactic scales in cdm cosmologies .",
    "the total energy of an observed galaxy is derived in terms of the virial theorem ; @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the 1-d internal velocity dispersion of the galaxy . assuming the energy conservation , i.e. , @xmath57",
    ", we have @xmath58    on the other hand , the time when the outer boundary of a perturbation collapses is analytically obtained ( @xcite ) as @xmath59 finally , using equations ( [ eqn : econ ] ) and ( [ eqn : tff ] ) , we have the collapse epoch as @xmath60 by equating this time with the hubble time @xmath61 , @xmath62 can be translated into the collapse redshift , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , it turns out that the velocity dispersion is a key quantity to determine @xmath11 .",
    "we use the observed stellar velocity dispersion as @xmath56 for elliptical galaxies .",
    "also , for some luminous ellipticals , @xmath56 is estimated by the x - ray temperature @xmath63 as @xmath64 .",
    "the estimation by x - ray gives typically twice the optical estimation , being probably the maximal assessment of @xmath65 .",
    "for spiral galaxies , we interpret the asymptotic rotational velocity into the velocity dispersion by the relation @xmath66 .",
    "the basic data on the luminosities and the velocity dispersions are taken from the table of faber et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for 332 ellipticals .",
    "the galaxies are selected from the original sample on the condition that the surface brightness , angular size , and velocity dispersion are measured .",
    "the x - ray data for 12 ellipticals are adopted from the table in matsumoto et al .",
    "further , for 468 spiral galaxies , we combine the i - band luminosities from mathewson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the asymptotic rotation velocities from persic & salucci ( 1995 ) .",
    "we pick up the galaxies whose asymptotic velocities [ @xmath67 as in persic & salucci ( 1995 ) ] are given .",
    "thus the number of galaxies is smaller than the original one .",
    "in figure [ fig2 ] , the bifurcation theory is confronted with observations . in this figure ,",
    "cosmological parameters are assumed as @xmath5 , @xmath68 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "all of these values are plausible in the light of the recent observations , although the value of @xmath69 parameter is still controversial . the small filled triangles and open circles represent respectively the observed elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "the open stars are the x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "we find that the two types of galaxies are successfully divided by the theoretical bifurcation mass scale .",
    "this implies that the self - shielding against uv background radiation is practically related to the origin of the galactic morphology .",
    "the difference between model a and b is not so significant , although model a predicts a bit more ellipticals than observed .",
    "also , it is worth noting that few spiral galaxies reside above the bifurcation mass scale , whereas there are a noticeable number of elliptical galaxies which seem to have formed at lower redshift epochs than predicted by the present theory . since a condition for constant velocity dispersion gives a relation @xmath70 in this diagram , most of discrepant low - redshift ellipticals turn out to be relatively luminous galaxies with higher stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "intriguingly , gonzalez ( 1993 ) has reported , using strengths of @xmath71 and [ mgfe ] indices , the evidence for intermediate - age populations in elliptical galaxies .",
    "in addition , it has been argued that the galaxy merger with burst - like star formation can lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ; barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1996 ; @xcite ) .",
    "also , shier & fischer ( 1998 ) suggest , by studying stellar kinematics of starbursting infrared - luminous galaxies with obvious morphological signatures of merger , that they can be progenitors of elliptical galaxies with high stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "thus , the discrepant low - redshift ellipticals might not be of primordial collapse , but could be a category of merger remnants .    in figure [ fig2 ] , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 cdm density perturbations normalized by cobe data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are also plotted .",
    "we find that elliptical galaxies form typically from @xmath75 perturbations and spirals do from @xmath76 peaks .",
    "if we change the cosmology , the results alter to some degree , because the bifurcation mass , the cdm spectra and the data points of elliptical , and spiral galaxies are relatively changed .",
    "the main change of figure [ fig2 ] comes from changing @xmath77 .",
    "the collapse epoch @xmath78 for the observational data is dependent upon @xmath77 as roughly @xmath79 for @xmath68 universe .",
    "this dependence is mainly due to the evaluation of dark mass in a galaxy .",
    "for instance , if we employ @xmath80 ( although it is unlikely ) , @xmath81 becomes almost 2.5 times smaller than the estimates in figure [ fig2 ] . in this case , the theory and the observational data seem perceptibly discrepant with each other . on the other hand , figure [ fig2 ] is insensitive to the cosmological constant parameter @xmath82 . in fact , even if we employ @xmath5 and @xmath83 , the relative position between the bifurcation mass and observations remains almost unchanged , although the correspondence between cdm fluctuations and observations shifts from @xmath75 to @xmath84 for ellipticals . in this case , the theory is in a good agreement with the observations .",
    "further details of the dependences on the cosmological model will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the present results are also intriguing from a view point of the statistics of galaxies .",
    "bardeen et al . (",
    "1986 ) have shown that higher @xmath85 peaks reside preferentially in denser regions rather than in low - dense regions . as a result , the so - called density morphology relation can be explained as a natural consequence of the bifurcation theory .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the specific angular momenta @xmath86 of spirals are systematically greater by a factor of @xmath87 than @xmath86 of ellipticals in the same mass range ( @xcite ) .",
    "based upon the tidal origin of the angular momentum , we expect @xmath88 , where @xmath89 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if ellipticals form from @xmath75 and spirals do from @xmath76 , then we anticipate @xmath90 .",
    "we appreciate the comments by the anonymous referee which helped us to improve the paper .",
    "we thank m. nagashima who kindly provided the data of mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we also thank y. kanya and r. nishi for useful information and comments .",
