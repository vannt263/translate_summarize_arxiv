    "dense qcd is of much relevance to compact stars and current heavy ion collisions .",
    "this subject has been intensely studied in the past decade following the observation that at asymptotic densities qcd matter may turn to a color superconductor due to asymptotic freedom  @xcite . at very large @xmath1",
    "there is evidence that the overhauser effect takes over with the formation of density waves  @xcite .",
    "indeed , at weak coupling the high degeneracy of the fermi surface causes quark - quark ( antiquark - antiquark ) pairing of the bcs kind with different color - flavor arrangements , while at large number of colors quark - antiquark pairing of the overhauser kind is favored . in strong coupling ,",
    "first principle calculations are elusive and the two pairings may compete .    to address the issue of strongly coupled qcd at large @xmath1 in dense matter",
    "we explore in this paper the holographic principle . in recent years",
    ", the gauge / string duality has provided a framework for addressing a number of problems in strong coupling where little is known from first principles in the continuum .",
    "to do so , we consider a model for holographic qcd recently discussed by sakai and sugimoto . in the limit @xmath5 , chiral symmetry in qcd",
    "is generated by immersing @xmath6 d8-@xmath7 into a d4 background in 5 dimensions where supersymmetry is broken by compactification ( kaluza - klein mechanism with @xmath8 scale ) .",
    "the induced dbi action on d8 yields a 4 dimensional effective theory of pions and infinitly many vector mesons where the @xmath8 scale plays the role of an upper cutoff ( the analogue of the chiral scale @xmath9 ) . at large @xmath1 baryons are skyrmions .    in this paper , we extend the analysis by sakai and sugimoto  @xcite to finite baryon density .",
    "although there have been many papers  @xcite on finite chemical potential in the holographic approach , all involve the r - charge or isospin instead of fermion number .",
    "the difficulty for the fermion number is that the @xmath10 charge for r - symmetry is already dual to the @xmath10 charge of ads reisner - nordstrom black hole charge .",
    "there is no additional @xmath10 in bulk to modify the geometry of the ads black hole . in this paper",
    "we follow the more traditional route of introducing the chemical potential via the nonperturbative induced dbi plus cs action through the external @xmath11 source in sakai and sugimoto chiral model .",
    "specifically , we introduce the baryon chemical potential as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the external vector field in the induced dbi plus cs action . while @xmath14 drops in the dbi part it contributes to the cs part through the wzw as it should .",
    "a redefinition of the vector fields in the sakai - sugimoto model necessary to enforce vector dominance , causes a reshuffling of @xmath14 from the cs to the dbi action as we detail below , with important phenomenological consequences .    in section 2",
    "we review the emergence of the induced effective action on the probe d8 brane from the 5 dimensional d4-brane background , and we detail the contributions of the dbi action to fourth order in the vector fields , as well as the chern - simons part .",
    "the expanded effective action enforces total vector dominance . in section 3",
    "we introduce the baryon chemical potential and details the nature of the effective expansion at finite density . in section 4 ,",
    "we extract the baryon number density , the pressure and the energy density of holographic dense matter . in section 5 , we discuss the pion and leading vector meson parameters and interactions in holographic dense matter .",
    "our conclusions and suggestions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the _ generalized holographic principle _ states that at large @xmath1 maximally supersymmetric and conformal gauge theories in flat d - dimensions are dual to superstring / mtheory on pertinent ads spaces , i.e. for @xmath15 it is @xmath16 and for @xmath17 it is @xmath18 .    to model qcd in @xmath15 dimensions ,",

    "second through another @xmath19 of radius @xmath22 with fermion antiperiodic boundary conditions to break susy . below the cutoff scale @xmath23 , the d=5 broken susy theory behaves as a d=4 gauge theory .",
    "doubly compactified d=6 is the boundary of @xmath24 in which the m - theory reduces to type iia string theory . as a result m5 branes wrapping around the first @xmath19 with radius @xmath25 transmute to d4-branes .",
