    "the discovery of a new family of superconducting materials with fe - as layers in their structure@xcite has triggered a large effort in the condensed matter community .",
    "@xmath4 is a much studied example of this family of compounds .",
    "the @xmath5  k record critical temperature@xcite in @xmath6 is second only to those observed in the cu - oxide family of high temperature superconductors .",
    "in addition , there are several aspects of the physics of the new fe - based superconductors that suggest the possibility of an exotic pairing mechanism at work :     ( 1 ) evidence is accumulating that phonons may not be sufficient to understand the superconductivity of these compounds.@xcite moreover , the importance of correlations between the electrons has been remarked in several investigations.@xcite in fact , it has been claimed that these oxypnictide superconductors may bridge the gap between mgb@xmath7 and the cu - oxide superconductors.@xcite in addition , a pseudogap was detected , similarly as in the cuprates.@xcite coexistence or proximity of magnetism and superconductivity has also been reported.@xcite although the parent undoped compound is not a mott insulator , these results suggest that the influence of electron - electron repulsions can not be neglected .",
    "perhaps the _ intermediate _ range of `` @xmath8 '' , where @xmath9 is the typical hubbard repulsion scale and @xmath10 the typical hopping amplitude in a tight - binding description , is the most representative of the new superconductors .",
    "@xmath9 can not be too large , otherwise the system would develop a gap and the undoped compound would be insulating , contrary to the experimentally observed properties of the undoped limit that suggest bad metallic behavior .",
    "but poor - metal characteristics imply that @xmath9 can not be too small either , otherwise the undoped system would be a good metal .",
    "in addition , the mere presence of a spin - density - wave magnetic state shows that correlations must be important .",
    "( 2 ) several experimental investigations suggest the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap.@xcite this is reminiscent of the nodes that appear in the @xmath11-wave superconducting state of the high - tc cuprates .",
    "however , other investigations indicate nodeless superconductivity.@xcite as a consequence , this issue is still controversial .",
    "( 3 ) the undoped parent compound has long - range spin order in the ground state.@xcite this magnetic state corresponds to spin `` stripes '' having the fe spins along one of the fe - fe crystal axes pointing all in the same direction , and being antiferromagnetically coupled in the perpendicular direction . according to neutron scattering experiments , in laofeas",
    "the transition to this magnetic state occurs at 134  k , and the magnetic moment is 0.36  @xmath12 , which is smaller than anticipated.@xcite for ndofeas,@xcite the critical temperature is 141  k and the magnetic moment is even smaller 0.25  @xmath12 .",
    "however , recently by means of resistivity , specific heat , and magnetic susceptibility measurements , the antiferromagnetic critical temperature of srfe@xmath7as@xmath7 was reported to be as high as 205  k , with a more robust fe magnetic moment of value 1.7  @xmath12.@xcite also , cafe@xmath7as@xmath7 was investigated using neutron diffraction , and a critical temperature 173  k with a moment 0.8  @xmath12 was reported.@xcite thus , although originally it was believed that the undoped material had a very weak magnetic state , the most recent results suggest that the spin striped order may be more robust .    on the theory front , several band - structure calculations have shown that the fermi surface of these and related compounds is made out of two small hole pockets centered at the @xmath13 point , and small electron pockets at the @xmath14 and @xmath15 points , in the notation corresponding to a square lattice of fe atoms.@xcite these calculations have also shown that the 3@xmath11 levels of fe play the dominant role in establishing the properties of these materials near the fermi level . to address theoretically the physics of these compounds , particularly the superconducting state , model hamiltonians are needed and several proposals for the dominant pairing tendencies have been made.@xcite in particular , a two orbital model based on the @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals was recently presented.@xcite several other investigations have addressed this model for the new superconductors , using a variety of approximations.@xcite classifications of the possible superconducting order parameters for the two - orbital model have been made.@xcite as already mentioned , a variety of experimental results suggest that the cooper pairs are spin singlets.@xcite thus , it is important to find the range of parameters leading to spin singlets in model hamiltonians , since several calculations produce either singlet or triplet superconductivity depending on the couplings and bandwidths used .",
    "for this experimentally - based reason , our focus here will be mainly on singlet superconductivity .      in this manuscript , a detailed study of the two orbital model for the oxypnictide superconductors",
    "is carried out using lanczos and pairing mean - field techniques .",
    "this effort provides a comprehensive view of the model , considerably expanding our recent research on the subject@xcite by varying the several couplings of the model and studying the main tendencies .",
    "when two electrons are added to the half - filled ground state , a spin - singlet state that transforms in a non - trivial manner under rotations is shown to dominate in the regime of couplings that is argued to be the most relevant to describe the new superconductors .",
    "in addition , the nodal structure of the superconducting state obtained using these spin - singlet pairs is here studied for this model using the pairing mean - field approximation .",
    "our results are compared with recent arpes experiments , and suggestions to further refine the search for nodes in those experiments are discussed .",
    "currently there is no consensus on what is the minimal model capable of capturing the essential physics of the oxypnictides .",
    "band structure calculations in the local - density approximation ( lda ) indicate that the bands that form the observed electron and hole pockets are strongly hybridized but they have mostly fe-3@xmath11 character.@xcite several authors argue that the hybridization of the fe-3@xmath11 is so strong that all 5 @xmath11 orbitals have to be considered to construct a minimal model .",
    "for instance , a five - orbital model has been proposed.@xcite the tight - binding term respects the feas lattice symmetries and the hopping parameters have been obtained from fittings against the lda calculations .",
    "the parameters used reproduce the fermi surface ( fs ) for the electron doped system ( i.e. electronic density @xmath18 ) but an extra hole pocket around m ( in the notation of the extended brillouin zone ) appears for the undoped case and upon hole doping . for this reason",
    ", the model may not be suitable to study the magnetic properties of the undoped system .",
    "in addition , the number of degrees of freedom in five - orbital models makes its study very difficult using numerical techniques .",
    "however , lda calculations have shown that , although heavily hybridized , the main character of the bands that determine the fs is @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with a small contribution of @xmath19 at the most elongated portions of the electron pockets.@xcite this fact has been the main justification for the proposal of two @xcite and three @xcite orbital models .",
    "the two - orbital model can have its hopping parameters fitted such that the shape of the fs , both in the undoped and electron and hole doped cases , are well reproduced in the reduced or folded bz .",
    "however , it has been argued by some authors @xcite that the two hole - pockets around @xmath13 have to arise from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals that are degenerate with each other at @xmath13 , as obtained in lda . in the two - orbital model ,",
    "one of the hole pockets forms around @xmath20 in the extended bz which gets mapped onto @xmath13 upon folding .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals that form the @xmath20-point pocket are degenerate at @xmath20 and , upon the folding , give rise to higher energy bands at the @xmath13 point .",
    "for this reason one of the hole pockets in the two orbital model may not have the correct linear combination of orbitals , potentially leading to incorrect conclusions .",
    "in addition , it is also argued that the contribution of the @xmath19 orbital to the electron pockets may play an important role that should not be ignored which motivated the proposal of the three - orbital model.@xcite however , the three orbital model can not eliminate a spurious hole pocket around @xmath20 .",
    "thus , a fourth orbital needs to be added to accomplish this task and , again , the number of degrees of freedom makes this model too complex to be studied numerically .",
    "then , the justification for continuing studying a minimal model with just _ two _ orbitals , as carried out in the present manuscript , is the following : _ ( i ) _ the correct shape of the fs is reproduced in the _ reduced _ brillouin zone , both in the doped and undoped cases . _",
    "( ii ) _ the main character of all the bands that determine the fs is @xmath16 and @xmath17 , except for a small portion of the electron pockets that has @xmath19 character . then",
    ", it it worthwhile to understand the role , if any , that this orbital plays in the magnetic and superconducting states . _ ( iii ) _ the two - orbital model is the only one that can be studied exactly with numerical techniques using the minimal size cluster needed for a spin striped state.@xcite thus , we believe that it is very important to establish which properties of the oxypnictides are properly captured by this model , and which ones not .",
    "the role that the correct shape of the fs plays can be investigated as well , and also the pairing symmetry and nodal structure involving only the @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals .",
    "it is interesting to notice that although two superconducting gaps may appear in a two orbital model,@xcite symmetry forces the magnitude of the gaps to be the same in this case.@xcite      the organization of the paper is as follows . in sections ii and iii ,",
    "the two - orbital model is derived .",
    "the emphasis is on the slater - koster ( sk ) procedure to evaluate the hopping amplitudes , but the model derived by this method is more general : it coincides with the two - orbital hamiltonian proposed earlier,@xcite and the values of the hoppings can be obtained also by fitting band - structure calculations.@xcite both sets of hopping parameters will be used in the following sections .",
    "the qualitative aspects of the magnetic and pairing states are shown to be the same for both sets of hopping amplitudes . in section iv ,",
    "results for the ground states of the undoped model ( half - filled ) and the case of two more electrons than half - filling will be discussed using the lanczos technique .",
    "the emphasis is on the dominant magnetic states and on the pairing tendencies , which are either in the spin singlet or triplet channels depending on couplings .",
    "moreover , the spin singlet case is shown to correspond to the @xmath0 representation of the @xmath1 lattice symmetry group of the model .",
    "section v contains a pairing mean - field analysis of the nodal structure of the model .",
    "the two orbitals nature of the problem causes the number and location of the nodes to be a more complex topic than for just one orbital . a qualitative comparison with experiments is included here .",
    "section vi contains our main conclusions .",
    "the possible source of the @xmath0 pairing and the @xmath2 pairing operator are discussed in the appendices .",
    "to study numerically the properties of @xmath21 and related compounds , it is necessary to construct a simple model , one that contains a minimum amount of degrees of freedom but still preserves the main physics of the problem . since all the materials in the family have in common the @xmath22 planes ( x = as , p , ... ) , as a first approximation we will just focus on those planes , similarly as it occurs in theoretical studies of the cu - o planes in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "in addition , band structure calculations@xcite have shown the relevance of the fe @xmath23 levels , and that mainly two bands determine the fermi surface ( see introduction ) . based on these considerations , here",
    "we will include only the @xmath16 and @xmath17 fe orbitals in our discussion . to estimate the hopping amplitudes for the tunneling from one fe to another and , thus , define a tight - binding model",
    ", we will calculate their hybridization with the three @xmath24 orbitals of as following the slater - koster formalism.@xcite from the fe - as hopping integrals , we will calculate the effective fe - fe tight - binding hopping parameters following a standard perturbative approach .",
    "thus , the hopping parameters in this model will be functions of the overlap integrals between the orbitals and the distance between the atoms .",
    "while this procedure is not as accurate as band - structure calculations , it provides a simple to understand approach that has `` ab - initio '' characteristics , can be easily reproduced since the calculations are analytical , and they also illustrate how the geometry of the problem affects the hoppings .     below the plane , while the red open circles are as atoms at a distance @xmath25 above the plane .",

    "an important result is that both sets of hoppings lead to similar qualitative results , both in the undoped case , regarding the magnetic state , as for two electrons added , regarding the pairing tendencies .",

    "a numerical study of the orbital composition of the bands that determine the fs in our two - orbital model indicates that the bands that constitute the pockets are an admixture of @xmath60 and @xmath61 orbitals .",

    "( [ 46a ] ) , @xmath85 is the intraband pairing for band @xmath97 , i.e. , the band with the highest energy ( electron band ) , while the intraband pairing for band @xmath98 ( hole band ) is @xmath99 .",
    "thus , there is a relative phase @xmath100 between the two intraband order parameters . in the standard bcs studies for multiband models",
    ", it is expected that pairs are formed by electrons in the same band.@xcite in the two orbital model , as just discussed , we found intraband pairing but we also obtain _ interband pairing _ with strength @xmath86 .",
    "the possibility of interband pairing has been considered previously in several contexts : ( i ) possibility of @xmath101@xcite , ( ii ) high @xmath101 cuprates,@xcite and ( iii ) heavy fermion systems,@xcite where it was shown that if two bands are very close to each other in the vicinity of the fermi level , interband pairing can occur .",
    "the weaker the pairing potential the closer to the fermi surface the two bands have to be .",
    "when long range pairing develops the brillouin zone gets folded and , as a result , the total number of bands doubles . in this representation , which arises by diagonalizing eq.([42 ] ) with @xmath72 , the two - orbital model has the dispersion shown in fig .",
    "[ dougshadow ] where each band ( panel ( a ) ) and fs ( panel ( b ) ) is represented with a different color and the folded ( unfolded ) portions with dashed ( continuous ) lines .",
    "it can be seen from panel ( a ) that at the fermi level there is only intraband crossing indicated by green circles . however , there is also interband crossing , indicated by the orange boxes , above the fermi energy .",
    "the previous numerical results appear to indicate that the effective coupling is sufficiently strong as to produce interband pairing . in fig .",
    "[ mfdoug ] it can be seen that even a small @xmath80 opens a gap between the two bands that cross away from the fs . in multiorbital models",
    "the opening of these gaps can lower the overall energy.@xcite within the standard bcs approach this result may appear counterintuitive and it could be an artifact of the two - orbital model or of the small system size that we have considered",
    ". however , there are clear indications that most of the fs in the five - orbital model have character @xmath16 and @xmath17@xcite and , in such a case , the only possible pairing operators that respect the symmetry of the feas planes are those that have been considered in our calculations and others.@xcite in fact , none of the 16 pairing operators that combine these two orbitals leads to a purely intraband pairing interaction .",
    "this , of course , could be an indication that other orbitals have to participate in the model but we believe that it is still instructive to consider the nodal structure that results from the pairing operator that was favored numerically within the two - orbital model and attempt to compare the results with experiments .",

    "the corresponding basis function is @xmath181 that transforms according to @xmath3 .",
    "this basis provides a pairing operator with a full gap and which is a spin singlet .",

    "note that this pairing operator corresponds to the @xmath2 pairing since it satisfies @xmath180 and there is no interband pairing .",

    "however , the lanczos numerical calculations presented in the text suggest that in the region of physical interest the undoped ground state has to be connected to the ground state with two extra electrons via a pairing operator that transforms according to @xmath0 and , for this reason , the @xmath2 state is not favored .",
    "it only can prevail in the strong coupling regime of @xmath9 and at the unphysical singular point @xmath157 , @xmath158 where the ground states in the doped and undoped regimes have the same symmetry and are connected by a pairing operator with @xmath3 symmetry .    for completeness ,",
    "let us also consider a @xmath2 pairing operator frequently used in the literature.@xcite in this context it is assumed that @xmath185 which is independent of the momentum .",
    "let us find whether this result is consistent with the symmetry of the two - orbital model . we start with @xmath186 and working backwards the form of @xmath82 is found . by this procedure",

    "the coexistance of pairs with different symmetries can occur only if the ground state with @xmath195 particles and/or the ground state with @xmath196 electrons are / is degenerate or nearly degenerate .",
    "numerically , we have found that the ground states appear to be singlets and connected by an operator with symmetry @xmath0 in the region of physical relevance or @xmath3 in the strong coupling limit . only in the unphysical singular point @xmath158 and @xmath157 states transforming according to @xmath3 , @xmath193 , and",
    "@xmath0 are very close to each other in energy .",
    "summarizing , here it was shown that the @xmath2 pairing operator that pairs electrons along the diagonals of the fe square lattice using the @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals does transform according to the @xmath3 irreducible representation of the @xmath1 group that characterizes the symmetry of the fe - as planes in the pnictides .",
    "numerically we found that this is the pairing symmetry that prevails in the strong coupling region but that in the physical regime the pairing operator must transform according to @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we have observed that the often - used momentum - independent approximation for the @xmath2 operator does not respect the symmetry of the fe as planes .",
