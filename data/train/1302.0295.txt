    "the standard model of particle physics is believed to be an effective theory valid up to energies close to 1  tev .",
    "however , no new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been observed yet , and it is critical to explore a wide range of possible signatures .",
    "a promising avenue lies in final states that involve the heaviest of the particles presumed to be elementary , the top quark .",
    "this document summarizes the status of these searches using the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite detectors at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the results are based on proton - proton collision data corresponding to integrated luminosities between 1  and 5  collected at a center - of - mass energy of 7  tev in 2011 .",
    "the fact that the top quark is the heaviest elementary particle might be a hint that it plays a special role in the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the so - called hierarchy problem refers to the fact that the large quantum contributions to the square of the higgs - boson mass should make the higgs mass many orders of magnitude larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "either there is an incredible , unnatural fine - tuning cancellation or nature chose another mechanism to protect the higgs mass to keep it at the observed low value  @xcite .",
    "many models introduce top partners to cancel these quantum corrections . finally , there are tantalizing hints of new physics in the forward - backward asymmetry in events at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "benchmark signal models are used to define signature - based searches in final states involving one or two leptons ( electrons and muons ) , jets , of which typically one or more are required to be identified as @xmath0-jets , and missing transverse momentum ( ) .",
    "the benchmarks include models of fourth - generation and vector - like quarks  @xcite , top partners in little higgs models  @xcite , as well as non - sm production of four top quarks  @xcite , same - sign top - quark pair ( @xmath1 ) production  @xcite , top+jet resonances in + jet events  @xcite , @xmath2 resonances  @xcite , and flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in single top - quark production  @xcite .",
    "searches for  resonances , third generation supersymmetry and new physics in top - quark decays and properties are covered elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "the experimental approaches are similar between atlas and cms .",
    "searches are based on the l+jets or dilepton  channels .",
    "jets are reconstructed from three - dimensional calorimeter energy clusters using the anti-@xmath3 jet clustering algorithm  @xcite with a radius parameter of @xmath4 for atlas and @xmath5 for cms .",
    "leptons are required to pass quality criteria and to be isolated  @xcite .",
    "the transverse momenta of jets and leptons are typically required to be larger than 20 or 25  gev or more .",
    "multivariate tagging algorithms  @xcite are used to identify @xmath0-jets .",
    "typically , the statistical tool bumphunter  @xcite is used to check for deviations , an excess or deficit , from the background hypothesis . in the absence of a signal ,",
    "cross - section and mass limits are derived for benchmark models using cls  @xcite or occasionally bayesian methods  @xcite .",

    "are assumed to decay with 100% branching fraction to the corresponding final state under study .",

    "data - driven multi - jet background estimates are based on the matrix method and on binned likelihood fits to the  distribution .",

    "alpgen  @xcite ( atlas ) and madgraph ( cms ) are used to model @xmath6+jets in mc simulation .",
    "the composition of the flavor of the quarks produced in association with the @xmath6 boson is measured in the low jet multiplicity bins and extrapolated using mc simulations .",
    "small backgrounds , like the production of single top quarks , boson pairs , + @xmath6 , + @xmath8 , and @xmath8+jets are typically estimated from mc simulations .",
    "the leading systematic uncertainties typically originate from the uncertainty in the jet energy scale , the @xmath0-tagging efficiency , and the  mc modeling . in certain cases",
    "the impact of systematic uncertainties on the sensitivity of the search is reduced by using gaussian constraints or other marginalization techniques , see e.g. ref .  .",
