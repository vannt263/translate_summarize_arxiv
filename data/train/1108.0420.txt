    "submillimetre ( submm ) galaxies ( smgs ) selected based on their 850@xmath7 m fluxes @xcite play an important role in the overall star - formation history of the universe .",
    "they are thought to be the high - redshift counterparts of the most infra - red luminous systems in the local universe such as the luminous infra - red galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultra - luminous infra - red galaxies ( ulirgs ) and progenitors of the most massive ellipticals seen today @xcite .",
    "however , the sensitivities of current generation submm instruments such as laboca biases the detection of smgs to those with cooler dust temperatures therefore missing a population of luminous but hotter starbursts at high redshifts .",
    "submm faint radio galaxies ( sfrgs ) have been proposed as an extension of the smg population to hotter dust temperatures @xcite .",
    "radio observations of sfrgs indicate that they are very similar to smgs in terms of radio morphology and size @xcite .",
    "together , these two populations have a sfr density at redshifts @xmath21 - 3 that is roughly comparable to the rest - frame uv selected population .",
    "these galaxies therefore represent a reasonably complete sample of infrared luminous galaxies at the main epoch of galaxy formation .    the most extensive spectroscopic sample of smgs and sfrgs to date has been presented in @xcite ( c04 and c05 hereafter ) .",
    "this sample has a median redshift of 22.5 with a dip in the numbers below @xmath8 where no strong spectral features fall into the keck - lris window used for redshift identification .",
    "redshifts obtained from the rest - uv analysis of this prodigiously star - forming massive galaxy population , have motivated further observations of these galaxies at multiple wavelengths all the way from the x - ray @xcite through the infra - red @xcite to the millimeter @xcite .",
    "such observations have been succesful in constraining a wide range of physical parameters such as the agn content , masses , sizes , morphologies and merging histories of these galaxies .",
    "the rest - uv spectra themselves are rich in spectral features @xcite that can be used to trace cool interstellar gas in the galaxies in order to look for signatures of outflows .",
    "provided that one can obtain a reasonable estimate of the systemic redshift of the galaxies , numerous absorption lines in the rest - uv can be used to probe the state of the cool atomic gas and characterise _ feedback _ processes in the galaxies .",
    "a wealth of observational evidence now suggests that galactic winds are in fact ubiquitous in galaxies with star - formation surface density , @xmath9yr@xmath1kpc@xmath10 @xcite and the most powerful starbursts can power winds that are approaching the escape velocity of the galaxy .",
    "winds that can escape the galaxy are likely to be responsible for the metal enrichment of the igm and the observed mass - metallicity relation of galaxies @xcite .",
    "there have been extensive studies of galactic scale outflows in local starbursts ranging from dwarfs @xcite to lirgs and ulirgs @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite extended this analysis to optically - selected star - forming galaxies at z@xmath21.5 using stacked spectra from the deep2 survey to demonstrate that outflows are also ubiquitous at high redshifts . at",
    "even higher redshifts , studies of the most luminous lyman break galaxies also show signs of outflowing gas in these systems @xcite and outflow velocities of several hundred kms@xmath1 have been measured in lensed lyman-@xmath11 emitting systems @xcite .",
    "the keck - lris spectra in c04 and c05 did not allow for a study of galactic scale outflows due to the lack of suitable spectral features for systemic redshift determination at the observed wavelengths .",
    "however , numerous individual submm detected galaxies have been studied in detail and shown to drive powerful outflows .",
    "these include n2 850.4 @xcite which shows blueshifted siii and caii interstellar absorption features with a velocity of 700 kms@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite use integral field spectroscopy to identify a highly energetic outflow from the submm galaxy smmj1237 + 6203 at z@xmath22 being radiatively powered by the agn and/or supernovae .",
    "similary , @xcite also show that the lensed starburst smm j14011 + 0252 at z@xmath22.6 is powering a superwind with velocity 350 - 500 kms@xmath1 .",
    "motivated by these previous studies , our objective in the current paper is therefore two - fold .",
    "firstly , we present a spectroscopic catalogue of smgs and sfrgs observed using the keck - ii deimos spectrograph with a view to filling in the _ redshift desert _ at z@xmath121.5 in the c04 and c05 samples .",
    "our galaxies have lower redshifts and lower characteristic luminosities compared to these previous studies thus helping us to characterise both the redshift and luminosity evolution of smg / sfrg properties .",
    "the wavelength window of the deimos spectrograph allows us to identify nebular [ oii ] 3727 emission , which can be used to determine the systemic redshifts of the galaxies as the warm ionized gas from which this emission originates is associated with young stars .",
    "the rest - uv spectra therefore also allow us to search for signatures of outflowing gas in the galaxies in order to compare to both the local starbursts as well as optically - selected star - forming galaxies at similar redshifts to our sample .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "@xmath13 [ sec : obs ] describes our sample selection , spectroscopic observations , galaxy properties derived from broadband photometry and creation of composite spectra . in @xmath13 [ sec : results ] we present the main results of our spectroscopic study including characterisation of the [ oii ] line profiles in the galaxies and derivations of outflow velocities and their dependence on galaxy properties .",
    "we discuss these trends in @xmath13 [ sec : disc ] .",
    "finally in @xmath13 [ sec : conclusion ] we give our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15=0.3 , @xmath16=0.7 and @xmath17=0.7 .",
    "all magnitudes quoted are on the ab system .",
    "we begin with a description of our sample selection and the spectroscopic observations .",
    "c05 have presented the most extensive catalogue of smg redshifts to date with the selection criteria aimed at identifying the bulk of the smg population brighter than s@xmath18=5mjy .",
    "the redshift distribution for these galaxies peaks around @xmath19 with a dip in the numbers below @xmath8 due to keck - lris s spectral coverage .",
    "hotter dust counterparts to these galaxies have also been presented in c04 spanning similar redshifts . with the aim of filling in the _ redshift desert _ in these samples , a redshift survey was carried out using the red - sensitive keckii deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; @xcite ) in order to target emission line galaxies at @xmath20 predominantly through their [ oii ] 3727 emission .",
    "the survey was carried out in 4 fields - hdf - n , lockman hole , sxdf and cfrs03 .",
    "all the targetted galaxies have robust detections in the radio , 850 @xmath7 m fluxes from scuba / jcmt ( see table [ tab : deimos1 ] ) or are detected in _",
    "herschel _ spire catalogues at 250 - 500@xmath7 m @xcite .",
    "radio data in the lockman hole is taken from @xcite and @xcite who identified the counterparts to the submm galaxies in these regions from @xcite .",
    "the radio data for sxdf is from a deeper map from arumugam et al .",
    "( in preparation ) and the submm counterparts are again identified from @xcite . the submm and radio data in the cfrs03 field is taken from @xcite .",
    "radio data in the hdf has been presented in @xcite and @xcite and submm detections in this field are taken from @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made with the keck ii deimos spectrograph on december 23 , 2003 , october 8 - 9 , 2005 , and february 22 , 2005 ( with seeing ranging from 0.6 - 1.0@xmath21 ) and the full sample of z@xmath21.3 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts is presented in table [ tab : deimos1 ] .",
    "the lower resolution mode was used in all cases to gain the widest wavelength coverage , with a grating of 600 lines / mm yielding a resolution of 3 or @xmath2100 kms@xmath1 ( measured from the sky lines ) and a scale of 0.65 / pixel . for a slit in the middle of the mask",
    "the observed wavelength range was 5600 to 9800  .",
    "the [ oii ] doublet is only moderately resolved in a handful of spectra in this setting and this and other red spectral features studied can be affected by proximity to the strong night sky oh recombination lines .",
    "all data was reduced using the deimos - deep2 pipeline @xcite .",
    "the candidate redshifts in all cases are based on identification of [ oii ] 3727 emission in the 2d spectra . in most cases , the redshift",
    "is then corroborated through identification of multiple emission and absorption lines , including subsets of feii(2344 , 2374 , 2383 , 2586 , 2600 ) , mgii(2803 , 2853 ) , h@xmath22(4103 ) , h@xmath23(4340 ) and ca h&k(3933,3969 ) in absorption , and [ neiii](3869 ) , [ nev](3426 ) and [ oiii](4959,5007 ) in emission .",
    "the deimos coverage allows us to target emission lines in galaxies between z=0.71.7 . in this redshift range , the spectroscopic completeness is estimated to be @xmath270% from the fraction of radio ids in the different masks with well - detected spectral features .",
    "redshifts are measured by fitting two gaussians of equal width and intensity centred at 3726.1 and 3728.8  to the blended [ oii ] line observed in most of the spectra .",
    "the [ oii ] redshift errors estimated from adjusting the gaussian fits to give @xmath24 @xmath25=1 are of the order of 60kms@xmath1 .",
    "as much of the paper is concerned with characterising velocity offsets of interstellar absorption lines from [ oii ] , it is important to devise a sensible method of measuring the centroids and widths of the absorption lines . the absorption line profiles are often highly asymmetric with large velocity tails and it is therefore not appropriate to fit gaussians to the line profiles .",
    "the velocities and equivalent widths are instead calculated by measuring the line centroids according to the apparent optical depth ( aod ) formalism of @xcite .",
    "errors in the [ oii ] redshift estimates , poor wavelength calibration at the blue - end of the spectrum and poor s / n could all lead to systematic differences between the [ oii ] and interstellar absorption line redshifts .",
    "redshift errors arising from the gaussian fits to the [ oii ] line have already been discussed .",
    "there are five examples of spectra where , in addition to [ oii ] , several other emission lines such as [ oiii ] , [ neiii ] , [ nev ] and various balmer absorption features are also detected .",
    "we find these features to be shifted by + 10@xmath480 kms@xmath1 relative to [ oii ] .",
    "this shift is within the typical redshift error associated with the gaussian fits .",
    "most of the individual 1d spectra in our sample do not have sufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n ) to be able to conduct a detailed spectroscopic characterisation .",
    "we therefore created composite spectra of various subsamples of galaxies for detailed analysis .",
    "we masked out sky lines in the individual observed frame spectra located at 5577 , 5592 and 6302  .",
    "the spectra were then shifted into the rest - frame using the systemic redshifts derived from a double gaussian fit to the [ oii ] line as described in @xmath13 [ sec : deimos ] .",
    "we defined a continuum using a 9th order polynomial fit in seven wavelength windows in which we do not expect any emission or absorption line features and divided each spectrum by this continuum .",
    "all spectra were then normalised to a common median of 1 in the wavelength range 2650 - 2750  ( a featureless window near the ism absorption line features that we are interested in studying ) .",
    "the spectra are then smoothed by a 5 pixel boxcar ( 1.5 ) in order to reduce noise in the spectra , before co - adding .",
    "the composite spectra are clipped averages of all the individual spectra making up the stack where the clipping procedure is such that 10% of the lowest and highest points contributing at each pixel are rejected from the stack leading to a total of 20% of the pixels being rejected . as can be seen later ,",
    "this procedure can also remove some signal from the composite spectra but due to the presence of significant noise in many of the composites , such a clipping is essential in order to ensure reliable line detections .",
    "errors on these composites are determined from jackknife sampling the individual spectra making up the stack .",
    "our spectroscopic survey was conducted in well - studied fields meaning that our galaxies have ancillary photometric data from optical to radio wavelengths .",
    "these data can be used to derive a range of physical properties such as the star - formation rates , bolometric luminosities , dust temperatures and crude stellar masses of the galaxies .",
    "the star - formation rates are calculated from the @xmath26 radio fluxes as the [ oii ] luminosity is highly dependent on both the metallicity and extinction and therefore not a good proxy for unobscured star - formation .",
    "we use the latest _",
    "herschel _ radio - fir correlation of @xmath27 @xcite to calculate the 8 - 1000@xmath7 m infra - red luminosities from the radio fluxes after k - correcting the radio flux assuming a spectrum with s@xmath28 . the star - formation rate",
    "is then calculated using the relation from @xcite :    @xmath29    in galaxies with strong agn signatures , there will also be some contribution to the radio flux from the agn so the star - formation rates should be taken as upper limits .",
    "both the total infra - red luminosity and the star - formation rates derived for all galaxies are presented in table [ tab : deimos2 ] .",
    "we also calculate the dust temperatures for our smgs using the empirical relation derived by c05 :    @xmath30    these are plotted as a function of the infra - red luminosity in figure [ fig : td ] and compared to the higher redshift smgs from c05 .",
    "as can be seen , the lower luminosity smgs also have cooler dust temperatures on account of their 850@xmath7 m selection which precludes detection of galaxies with hotter dust temperatures @xcite .",
    "-m selection of these sources results in an apparent trend of dust temperature with infra - red luminosity where lower luminosity galaxies are seen to have cooler dust temperatures.,width=321,height=226 ]      we derive stellar masses and corresponding errors for all our smgs and sfrgs using the _ hyperzmass _ code ( micol bolzonella : private communication ) which is based on the sed fitting code for photometric redshift determination , _ hyperz _ @xcite .",

    "b , v , i , z , musyc j , h , k and _ spitzer _ irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0@xmath7 m .",

    "irac photometry for the lockman and cfrs03 fields came from our own general observer ( go ) program as well as from publicly available data from various legacy and guaranteed time observation ( gto ) programs obtained through the _ spitzer science center ( ssc ) _ archive , and was reduced and combined using standard ssc pipeline products .",
    "optical and infra - red photometry for the lockman smgs was taken from the catalogues of @xcite .",
    "the photometry for sxdf smgs was obtained from the catalogues in @xcite , while that of the sfrgs came from @xcite .",
    "the hdf irac and _ hst_-acs photometry came from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use a set of 9 @xcite templates with exponentially declining star - formation histories with timescales , @xmath31 between 0.1 and 30 gyr as well as a constant star - formation history template .",
    "all the templates assume a @xcite imf and are at solar metallicity and we fit extinction values between @xmath32=0 and 6.0 .",
    "mass - to - light ratios in the h - band as well as dust extinction are derived from the best sed fits and the errors quoted represent the 68% lower and upper confidence limits obtained from the full probability distribution associated with the best chi - squared fit .",
    "these errors are very large ( of the order of 1 dex ) in some cases where a poor fit to the photometry was obtained .",
    "the derived stellar masses and dust extinctions for our sample can be found in table [ tab : deimos2 ] .",
    "we caution however that most of our galaxies are highly obscured systems with large degeneracies between age , reddening and star - formation histories .",
    "the actual errors in the stellar masses due to uncertainties in template - fitting and dust extinction are probably therefore considerable .",
    "@xcite for example find stellar masses that are 5@xmath33 lower than those estimated by @xcite for smgs due to difficulties in disentangling the underlying old stellar population in smgs from the recent burst even when correcting to the same imf .",
    "the median stellar mass for smgs in our sample is ( 3@xmath40.2)@xmath3310@xmath34m@xmath0 and for sfrgs , ( 6@xmath40.8)@xmath3310@xmath34m@xmath0 .",
    "if we had instead adopted a constant mass - to - light ratio in the h - band of 5.6 @xcite this would lead to median stellar masses of ( 4@xmath40.2)@xmath3310@xmath34m@xmath0 and ( 2@xmath40.2)@xmath3310@xmath34m@xmath0 for smgs and sfrgs respectively .",
    "the quoted uncertainties reflect the variance in the sample average . for comparison to these values , @xcite measure a median stellar mass of ( 9@xmath41)@xmath3310@xmath34m@xmath0 for smgs with photometric redshift @xmath22.2 while @xcite find a stellar mass of ( 7@xmath41)@xmath3310@xmath34m@xmath0 for a spectroscopic sample at similar redshifts . unlike in @xcite",
    "however , we have not subtracted any agn contribution to the continuum at 8@xmath7 m for the galaxies in our sample so our stellar masses for agn dominated systems should be interpreted as upper limits .",
    "given the large uncertainties in the mass estimates , we conclude that the stellar masses at z@xmath21.3 and z@xmath22 are not significantly different . in all subsequent analysis , we use the stellar masses derived from the full sed fits as presented in table [ tab : deimos2 ] .",
    "a subset of the galaxies in our sample have been classified as agn versus starburst dominated ( alaghband - zadeh et al . , ( in preparation ) ) based on various factors such as x - ray properties , [ nev ] detection and the [ neiii]/[oii ] ratio .",
    "these authors also derive metallicities by considering the [ neiii]/[oii ] ratio as a metallicity indicator @xcite .",
    "the metallicities and classifications derived by these authors are presented in table [ tab : deimos1 ] and will be used to divide galaxies into different subsamples later in the paper .",
    "we note here however , that some of our galaxies appear to have very low metallicities derived from the high [ neiii]/[oii ] ratio .",
    "this high flux ratio could arise from the presence of a strong agn rather than an intrinsically low metallicity galaxy @xcite and the former is more likely as smgs and sfrgs are seen to be very massive systems ( @xmath13[sec : stellarmass ] ) which are likely to already have been enriched to solar metallicities @xcite .",
    "the sample of smgs and sfrgs with secure redshifts that are analysed in this study has been summarised in tables [ tab : deimos1 ] and [ tab : deimos2 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : compare ] we show the redshift distribution for smgs and sfrgs in our sample compared to the higher redshift smgs ( c05 ) and sfrgs ( c04 ) observed with lris .",
    "the smg distribution has been scaled by the total area of each survey - 721 sq arcmins in c05 and 278 sq arcmins in this study .",
    "the sfrg distribution was not scaled as the sfrgs were chosen as mask fillers making it difficult to assess their total survey area and completeness . as such , they are over - represented in this study while being under - represented in c04 relative to c05 .",
    "it can clearly be seen that this spectroscopic sample of smgs and sfrgs helps to effectively fill in the _ redshift desert _ at z@xmath21.5 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : compare2 ] , we also show the redshift versus bolometric luminosity distribution for our galaxies compared to those of c04 and c05 . both this sample and the c04,c05 samples",
    "have been selected in the same manner using their 850@xmath7 m fluxes and radio data . as can be seen in figure [ fig : compare2 ] ,",
    "selecting sources at a constant radio flux allows us to probe lower luminosity populations at lower redshifts .",
    "however , the 850@xmath7 m fluxes of smgs at z@xmath21.5 and z@xmath22 should be reasonably similar due to the effects of the negative k - correction at submm wavelengths .",
    "as the smgs in both this work and c05 were selected based on both their radio and 850@xmath7 m fluxes , the differences in luminosity between the two populations likely arises due to a combination of the radio k - correction and some intrinsic luminosity evolution .          while the s / n in the majority of our spectra is not good enough to be able to detect many interstellar absorption features , the [ oii ] emission line is detected at high significance in almost all the spectra and is the main line used for redshift measurement . in this section ,",
    "we characterise the [ oii ] linewidth in the galaxies in our sample and use these to derive circular velocities and dynamical masses .",
    "the @xmath35-values obtained from fitting two gaussians of equal width to the [ oii ] doublet are tabulated in table [ tab : deimos1 ] .",
    "there were a few sources for which the [ oii ] fit was poor as a result of the line being close to the edge of the spectrum or close to sky line residuals .",
    "while crude redshifts were still derived for these galaxies , the @xmath35-measurement was highly uncertain and therefore not quoted .",
    "these galaxies have been flagged in table [ tab : deimos1 ] .",
    "in addition , a few galaxies show very broad [ oii ] emission . in most cases ,",
    "this is due to the proximity to night sky lines although one galaxy - lock492 - does show some evidence for multiple components in the [ oii ] emission seen in the 2d spectrum .",
    "again , these galaxies have been flagged in table [ tab : deimos1 ] .        where @xmath37 is the radius , @xmath38 is the gravitational constant and @xmath39 is a constant that depends on the galaxy s mass distribution , velocity field as well as the inclination .",
    "@xmath39 is assumed to be 2.1 for a rotating disk @xcite assuming an inclination correction of sin(i)=0.5 @xcite , and @xmath405 for an isotropic virialised system .",
    "we compute dynamical masses for both the isotropic and rotating disk estimators and take the true dynamical mass of the galaxy to be the average of these two estimators . for the radius ,",
    "we assume @xmath41kpc consistent with that found from h@xmath11 observations of smgs @xcite and with the typical size of the [ oii ] emission region in our 2d spectra .",
    "the dynamical masses are presented in table [ tab : deimos2 ] .",
    "the mean dynamical mass is ( 3.0@xmath40.3)@xmath3310@xmath34m@xmath0 for smgs and ( 5.9@xmath40.3)@xmath3310@xmath34m@xmath0 for sfrgs which is consistent with the higher redshift sample of smgs studied by @xcite given differences in assumptions about the constant , @xmath39 .",
    "the error bars on these mean estimates represent the sample variance but there are also significant systematic uncertainties in the computation of these dynamical masses in particular arising from assumptions about the mass distribution in the galaxies as well as their inclination on the sky .",
    "the virial mass estimate detailed above necessarily assumes that [ oii ] emission follows the total mass distribution of the galaxies .",
    "nebular regions in galaxies are often centrally concentrated so this assumption will almost certainly lead to an under - estimate of the total dynamical mass .",
    "in addition , tidal tails from mergers may result in an additional contribution to the dynamical mass from the moment of inertia of the system although the departure from virial is likely to be small in early merger stages .",
    "@xcite find that mergers may lead to a factor of 2 increase in the dynamical mass estimates , likely driven by differences in assumptions regarding the value of @xmath37 for mergers .    in order to aid our comparison of the dynamical and stellar masses ,",
    "we consider the typical sizes of the regions from which the nebular and stellar emission originates . the [ oii ] region has already been seen to extend to @xmath26kpc .",
    "hst studies of z@xmath22 smgs suggest typical half - light radii of 2.8@xmath40.4 kpc in the h - band @xcite .",
    "@xcite measure a slightly larger value of 3.4@xmath40.3 kpc in the k - band from ground - based imaging .",
    "these near infra - red bands are typically used to calculate the mass - to - light ratio for the stellar mass estimates so we can see that the effective stellar mass aperture is around a factor of 2 smaller than the kinematic aperture assumed in the dynamical mass estimates .    in figure",
    "[ fig : masses ] we plot the stellar mass versus the dynamical mass for all our galaxies .",
    "the average dynamical masses are similar to the average stellar masses of smgs and sfrgs computed in @xmath13[sec : stellarmass ] and mostly consistent within the large systematic uncertainties in both mass estimates which we estimate to be of the order of 1 dex .",
    "several of the agn have their stellar masses over - estimated due to excess emission at 8@xmath7 m .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sigma ] , we plot the [ oii ] full - width - half - maximum as a function of the star - formation rate derived from the infra - red luminosities . for reference",
    ", we also plot the h@xmath11 linewidths for the higher redshift sample of smgs from @xcite as well as the [ oii ] linewidths and star - formation rates for optically - selected star - forming galaxies at z@xmath21.5 @xcite .",
    "there is a large scatter in the nebular linewidths for both samples of smgs / sfrgs but they overlap , suggesting that many smgs and sfrgs at redshifts 1.3 have similar dynamical masses to those at redshift 2 . we conclude that while smg bursts are occurring in halos of similar masses at z@xmath21.3 and z@xmath22.2 , the lower redshift smgs are intrinsically less luminous .",
