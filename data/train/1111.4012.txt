    "the balanced homodyne detector ( hd ) is a useful tool in quantum optics and quantum information processing with continuous variables @xcite since it can be used to measure field quadratures of an electromagnetic mode .",
    "these measurements provide information for complete reconstruction of quantum states in the optical domain ( optical homodyne tomography ) .    with developing tools of continuous - wave quantum - optical state engineering @xcite as well as state and process tomography @xcite , the performance requirements for homodyne detectors continue to increase .",
    "the design of hds for time - domain quantum tomography @xcite is based on four main performance criteria : a ) high bandwidth and a flat amplification profile within that bandwidth ; b ) high ratio of the measured quantum noise over the electronic noise ; c ) high common mode rejection ratio ( cmrr ) ; d ) quantum efficiency of the photodiodes .",
    "the _ high bandwidth _",
    "requirement comes from the fact that an hd must be able to measure field quadratures with sufficient time resolution . in the case of pulsed lasers",
    ", this corresponds to the inverse of the repetition rate of the pulses ; in the case of a continuous signal , the required resolution is determined by the duration of the optical mode in which the signal states are produced @xcite .",
    "this is technically challenging because most amplifiers have a limited gain - bandwidth product . increasing the bandwidth implies reducing the gain , which , in turn , increases the effect of the electronic noise .",
    "also the high frequency circuit layout poses a challenge to designers .    within its bandwidth range , the hd must feature a _ flat amplification profile_. if this is not the case , the response of the hd to each individual pulse will exhibit ringing , which degrade the detector s time resolution and distort the measurement .",
    "this requirement also presents a major design challenge .",
    "any non - desirable ambient noises , dark current noises from the photodiodes and the intrinsic noise of the amplifiers fall under the umbrella of _ electronic noise_. the effect of this noise is to add a random quantity @xmath0 to the measurement of the field quadrature @xmath1 .",
    "this effect is equivalent to an additional optical loss channel with transmission @xcite @xmath2 as we show below , the value of @xmath3 depends not only on the characteristics of the detector , but also on the conditions of the measurement in which the detector is used .",
    "a hd must have a _",
    "high subtraction capability _ between the two photocurrents produced by the photodiodes .",
    "this can be expressed as a generalized common mode rejection ratio ( cmrr ) of the balanced detection @xcite .",
    "the cmrr measures the ability of the device to reject the classical noise of the local oscillator @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important in the pulsed case because a low cmrr ( which implies a poor subtraction ) will result in contamination of the signal with the repetition rate of the pulse and harmonics .",
    "additionally , this lack of subtraction capability will make the hd more susceptible to saturation by the amplified signal from the photodiodes .",
    "high cmrr is difficult to achieve because the response functions of the photodiodes are not exactly the same .",
    "therefore a pair of photodiodes with response functions as similar as possible must be chosen .",
    "experimentally , these performance benchmarks can be measured using an electronic spectrum analyzer .",
    "the spectrum of the homodyne output photocurrent gives information about the detector s bandwidth and amplification profile .",
    "observing the output current in the absence of the local oscillator provides information about the magnitude and spectrum of the electronic noise .",
    "the lower bound on cmrr is determined by comparing the hd spectra when both photodiodes are illuminated and when only one is illuminated while the other is blocked .    in the present work , we quantitatively relate the measured electronic spectra to added noise in quadrature measurements .",
    "we show that the limited bandwidth and electronic noise can be translated into equivalent optical losses such as in eq .",
    "( [ etae ] ) .",
    "we show how to estimate and reduce these losses for a specific time - domain experiment .",
    "in fact , in many cases ( particularly , in the continuous - wave regime ) electronic spectral measurements on the hd photocurrent in the presence and absence of the local oscillator are sufficient to precisely calculate the equivalent loss associated with the electronics .",
    "the theoretical discussion in this paper is limited to the effects of the bandwidth and the electronic noise in two practically relevant regimes .",
    "the effect of the non - unitary quantum efficiency on quantum state reconstruction is well known @xcite . a discussion of cmrr has been presented in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we then demonstrate an easy to follow method for the design and construction of a wideband homodyne detector using commercial available components such as low - noise high - speed operational amplifiers and high - bandwidth photodiodes .",
    "aside from high performance benchmarks , a special feature of our detector is its versatility : it is designed and tested to operate in both the continuous - wave or pulsed regimes .",
    "therefore the unit presented here may be useful for a wide range of quantum optics experiments .",
    "balanced homodyne detection consists of overlapping the signal mode carrying the quantum state in question and a strong reference field in a matching mode ( the local oscillator , or lo ) on a symmetric beam splitter .",
    "the two output signals of this beam splitter are directed to the two photodiodes of the hd , where these fields are detected and subtracted . neglecting experimental imperfections , the subtraction photocurrent is then @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the instantaneous field quadrature value in the signal mode , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the local oscillator amplitude and phase , respectively , and @xmath8 is a proportionality coefficient related to the hd amplifier gain .",
    "it is assumed that the local oscillator phase is constant .",
    "the instantaneous quadrature observable can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the time dependent photon annihilation operator@xcite . in a practical hd ,",
    "the relationship between the quadrature measurement and the output current is more complex .",
    "it can be approximated by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the detector s electronic noise and @xmath13 is its response function .",
    "an ideal detector would have @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in practice",
    "these conditions are not met .    as evident from eq .",
    "( [ cprachd ] ) , the impact of the electronic noise is minimized by raising the power of the local oscillator and the amplifier gain . however , practical possibilities of increasing the gain without proportionally increasing the electronic noise are limited .",
    "the local oscillator power must also be restricted to avoid saturation of the photodiodes and eliminating the classical noise @xcite .",
    "therefore in the analysis below we assume @xmath8 and @xmath16 to equal their optimal values for the given experimental setting .      in the continuous regime ,",
    "the amplitude of the local oscillator is a constant : @xmath17 .",
    "we are interested in measuring the quadrature of the signal field associated with a particular ( normalized ) temporal mode function @xmath18 , which we assume real : @xmath19 to that end , we integrate the homodyne photocurrent with a certain weight function @xmath20 , obtaining a _ measured _ quadrature value , @xmath21 in which the last term , @xmath22 corresponds to the electronic noise contribution , which we will discuss later .",
    "first , we discuss the effect of finite detector response function ( bandwidth ) on the quadrature measurement .",
    "equation can be rewritten as @xmath23 where @xmath24 by comparing eqs .",
    "and we find that , by choosing @xmath20 such that @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 , i.e. , the distortions associated with the detector s finite bandwidth are completely eliminated .",
    "this may however be difficult in practice , because the required weight function is a _ deconvolution _ of the temporal mode of interest and the detector s response .",
    "lack of precise knowledge of either of the above may lead to significant errors in deconvolving .",
    "if @xmath27 , the detection efficiency is degraded by the mode matching factor @xcite @xmath28 where the denominator normalizes @xmath29 .",
    "a practically important particular case is when the temporal mode of the signal is known and the finite bandwidth of the detector is neglected , so @xmath20 is set to equal @xmath18 . in fig .",
    "[ mmcvfig ] , the efficiency obtained in this setting is plotted for gaussian @xmath18 and @xmath30 as a function of the detector bandwidth , which , as we show below , is obtained from the fourier transform of the response function . as we see , the detector bandwidth has no significant degrading effect on the measurement ( @xmath31 ) as long as it is comparable to or larger than the inverse temporal width of the signal temporal mode .    .",
    "both functions are assumed gaussian .",
    "[ mmcvfig ] ]    let us now calculate the contribution of the electronic noise to the measured quadrature , so the equivalent efficiency can be estimated .",
    "we start with the electronic spectra of the hd output photocurrent in the absence and in the presence of the local oscillator , with the signal in the vacuum state . according to the wiener - khintchine theorem ,",
    "these spectra are given , respectively , by @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the frequency and the averaging is performed over both time @xmath35 and the quantum ensemble of the vacuum signal state .",
    "the autocorrelation function in the latter equation can be further simplified as @xmath36 because , in the vacuum state , @xmath37 . from the above",
    ", we find @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the fourier image of @xmath30 .",
    "in other words , neglecting the electronic noise , the spectrum of the hd output current in the continuous regime is simply the squared amplitude of the fourier transform of the detector s response function .",
    "note , however , that the response function can not be obtained from this spectrum because inverse fourier transformation also requires data on the phase of @xmath40 .",
    "the response function can be measured directly in the time domain with a pulsed lo as discussed below .",
    "let us now discuss the contribution of electronic noise to quadrature measurements . from eq .",
    "( [ qmeascv1 ] ) , and because in the vacuum state @xmath41 , we can write @xmath42 where the variance of the electronic noise component is given by @xmath43 combining the above two results with eq .",
    ", we find @xmath44 equations and lead us to an important conclusion : by knowing the homodyne output spectra @xmath45 and @xmath46 , as well as the weight function @xmath20 , one can predict the fraction of the electronic noise in the measured quadrature variance in an arbitrary temporal mode .",
    "this , as discussed above , directly translates into an equivalent optical loss .    in the case of a high - bandwidth detector ,",
    "when @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be assumed constant over the support of @xmath47 , we have @xmath48_{\\textrm{signal bandwidth}}.\\ ] ] this quantity , which we call _ clearance _ of the detector s shot noise over the electronic noise , is one of the primary characteristics of any hd circuit .",
    "now let us suppose that the lo is pulsed , with the pulse width much shorter than the time resolution of the electronics . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ cprachd ] ) takes the form @xmath49 where the pulse is assumed to occur at @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the normalized quadrature operator corresponding to the signal mode defined by the shape of the lo pulse , with @xmath52 being the effective amplitude of the local oscillator pulse . in other words , neglecting the electronic noise , the shape of the hd response to a single short pulse is given by the detector s response function .",
    "the quadrature measurement is obtained by integrating the homodyne photocurrent over a certain time interval : @xmath53 with @xmath54 the optimal choice of the integration limits is determined by the bandwidths of the detector s electronic noise and the temporal width of its response function .",
    "when the local oscillator is a train of pulses with repetition period @xmath55 , the hd output current is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the quadrature operator of the @xmath58th pulsed signal mode , with the pulse of interest having index @xmath59 .",
    "if the response function is nonzero over an interval longer than @xmath55 , the quadrature measurement is contaminated by that of the neighboring pulses : @xmath60 where @xmath61 . the sum in eq .",
    "( [ qmeassum ] ) defines a new measured mode whose state is not necessarily identical to that in the @xmath59th pulsed mode .",

    "are negligibly small for @xmath68 : most of the ringings occur _",

    "( [ qmeassum ] ) , and because @xmath69 in the vacuum state , @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the quadrature measurement for the @xmath72th pulse .",
    "the above correlation can be easily obtained experimentally , from which one can determine @xmath73 one then calculates @xmath74 for each experimentally measured quadrature , thereby eliminating contamination from neighboring pulses .",
    "the resulting quadrature values are then renormalized and used in quantum state reconstruction . by means of this technique",
    ", the reconstruction efficiency has been improved in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now use eq .",
    "( [ snu ] ) to determine the spectral power of the hd output in the pulsed regime .",
    "the ensemble average of @xmath75 is a periodic function of time @xmath35 , hence we can write @xmath76 in the vacuum state , @xmath77 accordingly , @xmath78 we see that in spite of the pulsed character of the local oscillator , the hd spectrum is determined by the fourier transform of its response function akin to the continuous case .",
    "an important difference is the multiplication by the pulse repetition rate : when the separation between the pulses is increased , the spectral power reduces proportionally .",
    "in contrast to the continuous regime , in the pulsed case the evaluation of the equivalent efficiency requires knowledge of @xmath30 ; information on the spectra @xmath45 and @xmath46 is not sufficient .",
    "let us , however , consider a practically important particular case when the bandwidth of both the detector s response and the electronic noise greatly exceed the laser repetition rate .",

    "we then have @xmath84 where @xmath85 here",
    "we again took advantage of the high bandwidth of the electronic noise to modify the integration limits .",
    "we also used the fact that the electronic noise @xmath12 is a stationary stochastic process to eliminate the dependence on @xmath86 . substituting eqs .",
    " into eq .",
    "( [ etae ] ) , we find @xmath87 in other words , the shot - to - electronic - noise clearance measured in the pulsed regime yields a too conservative estimate for the equivalent loss associated with the electronic noise in the high - bandwidth limit . in order to minimize this loss",
    ", one needs to choose the integration interval that is as short as possible , but still accommodates the entire detector response function .",
    "however , if the detector bandwidth does not greatly exceed the laser repetition rate , we have @xmath88 and the factor of @xmath89 in the above equation can be neglected .",
    "the exact value for the equivalent loss in this case can not be determined from the spectra because it depends on the shape of the detector s response function @xmath30 .",
    "now we present an efficient wideband hd constructed with easily available components , as well as tips to solve the most common challenges found when building such a device .",
    "we show the results given by our hd in experiments with a pulsed laser source ( 76 mhz repetition rate ) as well as with a continuous wave laser .",
    "these features give our hd a great versatility for applications in different kinds of experiments .",
    "our electronic cicruit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schm ] .",
    "the values and identification names are as noted on the schematic .",
    "provision has been made for a second stage of voltage gain which , however , proved to be unnecessary .",
    "we use a homemade @xmath90 v dc power supply . to avoid possible leakage of any ambient noise to the hd through the voltage supply lines ,",
    "each of them is filtered for both high and low frequencies ( components l1 , l2 , c13 , c14 , c15 , c16 that include a ferrite choke , a 100 @xmath91f electrolytic and a 0.1 @xmath91f ceramic capacitors ) .",
    "the use of long power supply lines in the circuit can create parasitic inductances making the circuit susceptible to instabilities . because it is not possible to make all the tracks short , we perform the filtering in two stages , at the beginning and the end of each power supply track .",
    "the filtered @xmath90 volt supply rails are each further separated into 3 isolated lines by incorporating 3 networks consisting of a fast schottky diode ( for improving the stability of the power supplies ) , a tantalum 6.8 @xmath91f capacitor and a 0.1 @xmath91f ceramic capacitor ( components c1c12 and d3d8 ) . these isolated supplies in turn feed @xmath92 v regulators for the photodiodes ( ic3 and ic8 ) and two pairs of @xmath93 v regulators for the first and second stage operational amplifiers ( ic2 , ic5 , ic4 and ic7 ) .",
    "care has been taken to isolate and regulate the supply voltage for the detectors and amplifiers in order to provide as stable and oscillation free platform as possible .",
    "bypass 0.1 @xmath91f capacitors are located at the regulator outputs very close to the amplifiers ( c18c23 ) .",
    "one of the primary challenges in achieving a high - bandwidth hd is associated with the photodiodes .",
    "their p - n junction has a terminal capacitance which has to be significant for high quantum efficiency of detection .",
    "the feedback resistance of the amplifier will form a low pass filter with the terminal capacitance , thus limiting the high - frequency response of the circuit . furthermore ,",
    "this capacitance combined with other capacitances and inductances in the circuit board can give rise to instabilities and oscillations associated with a low pass filter configuration .",
    "the terminal capacitance of the photodiodes can be reduced by increasing the reverse bias voltage across them .",
    "this , however , increases the dark current that contributes to the electronic noise @xcite .",
    "consequently , special care must be taken for choosing photodiodes with very low capacitance and dark current , as well as for a printed circuit board ( pcb ) design that avoids or compensates any capacitance that could produce oscillations ( instabilities ) in the frequency response of the hd .",
    "we have chosen to use hamamatsu s5972 photodiodes .",
    "this photodiode has a 91% quantum efficiency at a wavelength of 780 nm and a high cut - off frequency ( 500 mhz ) when supplied in a 12 v reverse voltage configuration .",
    "other reasons for this choice include a very low dark current ( 11 pa at 12v reverse voltage ) and a low terminal capacitance ( 2.8 pf at 12v reverse voltage ) .",
    "the amplification circuit starts at the junction of the two s5972 photodiodes , which is the differential sum point for the input to the first stage amplifier .",
    "the amplification of the difference signal is carried out by a single texas instruments opa847 operational amplifier ( op - amp ) in trans - impedance configuration with a trans - impedance gain of 4 k@xmath94 ( ic1 ) .",
    "for testing purposes we place a jumper ( j1 ) in the inverting input of the op - amp . in order to have control of the dc offset of output signal produced by the the op - amp we place in its non - inverting input a capacitor of 0.1 @xmath91f in parallel with a variable resistor of 10 k@xmath94 both connected to ground ( c17 and r4 ) . with the help of the variable resistor we can maintain the dc offset at the zero reference point to avoid saturation in the op - amp .",
    "the optional second stage is designed to use an opa847 in inverting amplifier configuration . j2 and j3 are the positions of its input and feedback resistances .    an important component of the circuit is a custom made variable capacitor ( c24 ) placed in parallel to the feedback resistance r2 .",
    "this capacitor is constructed by twisting two wires with a variable number of twists . by twisting ( or untwisting ) these wires",
    "we can vary their capacitance ; although it is very small , it is enough to change the response of the circuit . in our case",
    "it is used to flatten the spectral response of the hd .",
    "finally , resistors r3 , r5 and r6 are used for impedance matching of the output signal of the amplifier with a 50@xmath94 coaxial connector .",
    "all components are soldered on a specially designed printed circuit board ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pcb ] ) . when designing the layout for the circuit we take the following factors into consideration .    * the tracks on the pcb",
    "are kept as short as possible to avoid parasitic inductances . *",
    "a ground ( gnd ) plane , essential for high frequency circuits , and a double - sided board design are used .",
    "the back side of the pcb is mainly reserved for the gnd plane , with the fewest possible discontinuities .",
    "this separation between tracks and components in one side and gnd on the other minimize possible capacitances between the tracks and the ground plane of the circuit . *",
    "the use of surface mount components is preferred for the high frequency regime of electronics . * in order to provide a mechanically stable platform for the hd , the circuit module is mounted on a 0.25-inch aluminum plate . * to ensure a maximally balanced response , we designed our circuit to be as symmetrical as possible . *",
    "the hd is shielded by a custom - made metal box to avoid any environmental noise impact on the circuit .",
    "* to minimize the parasitic capacitance the two photodiodes were placed closely together in the upper left corner of the board . * due to its relatively large size , the offset adjustment potentiometer ( r4 ) for the first stage is placed at the bottom of the printed circuit board to avoid the issue of having long tracks on the upper side .        ,",
    "after having built the hd we proceed to test its performance . to that end , we place it in the experimental set - up shown in fig .  [",

    "the two beams coming out of the beam splitter are focused into the photodiodes .",
    "the hd is balanced by first adjusting the waveplate in order to equalize the responses of the photodiodes , compensating for a possible difference in their quantum efficiencies , thereby minimizing the spurious signal at the local oscillator repetition rate . a further crucial step in balancing",
    "the hd is to equalize the path lengths of the two beams entering the photodiodes by using a xy translation stage on which the hd is mounted .",
    "this is necessary because the pulses , if arriving at the photodiodes at different times , can lead to subtraction pulse having a bipolar shape . even after these alignment steps , the subtraction may not be perfect due to different capacitances of the two photodiodes .",
    "subsequently , the hd is tested for electronic instabilities and oscillations .",
    "this is done by observing the output signal of the hd ( with the lo power of 6 mw ) with a spectrum analyzer in a range from 100 khz up to 3 ghz .",
    "if present , instabilities produce peaks in the spectral response at frequencies different from the repetition rate of the lo and its harmonics .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive theory and an easy to follow method for the design and construction of a wideband homodyne detector for time - domain quantum measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we show how one can evaluate the performance of a detector in a specific time - domain experiment based on electronic spectral characteristic of that detector . </S>",
    "<S> we then present and characterize a high - performance detector constructed using inexpensive , commercially available components such as low - noise high - speed operational amplifiers and high - bandwidth photodiodes . </S>",
    "<S> our detector shows linear behavior up to a level of over 13 db clearance between shot noise and electronic noise , in the range from dc to 100 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the detector can be used for measuring quantum optical field quadratures both in the continuous - wave and pulsed regimes with pulse repetition rates up to about 250 mhz . </S>"
