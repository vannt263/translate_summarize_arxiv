    "a central problem in the theory of legendrian knots in the standard contact @xmath1-space is to produce effective invariants and understand their geometric meaning .",
    "the first `` classical '' invariants of legendrian knots were the thurston - bennequin and rotation numbers @xcite .",
    "these two invariants classify legendrian knots in the standard contact structure when the underlying smooth knot type is the unknot @xcite , a torus knot , or the figure eight knot @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "these early results raised the question of whether non - isotopic legendrian knots with the same classical invariants exist .",
    "a particular instance of this question was fuchs and tabachnikov s legendrian mirror question @xcite : given a legendrian knot @xmath2 with rotation number zero , is it isotopic to its image @xmath3 under the contactomorphism @xmath4 ?",
    "this map is isotopic to the identity through diffeomorphisms but not contactomorphisms ( it changes the sign of the contact form ) .",
    "new invariants , beginning with legendrian contact homology @xcite and followed by normal rulings @xcite and the knot floer homology legendrian invariant @xcite , have been used to find non - isotopic legendrian knots with the same classical invariants . in this paper , we study the algebraic structure of the legendrian contact homology differential graded algebra ( dga ) and how it can be used to define computable invariants of legendrian knots that are stronger that chekanov s linearization and that detect the geometric property of a legendrian knot not being isotopic to its legendrian mirror .",
    "the legendrian contact homology of a legendrian knot @xmath2 is the homology of a free non - commutative dga @xmath5 over @xmath6 whose differential is nonlinear , so it is extremely hard to exploit directly .",
    "several methods have been devised to extract useful information from the dga .",
    "the most tractable of these is chekanov s method of linearization , which uses an `` augmentation '' @xmath7 to produce a finite - dimensional chain complex whose homology is denoted @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the loss of noncommutative structure , however , means that linearized homology is unable to detect any differences between a legendrian knot and its mirror ; this is also true of another easily computable invariant , a normalized count of augmentations @xcite .",
    "chekanov also defined higher - order linearizations that take nonlinear parts of the differential into account , but these have not yet proved to be any more effective than the original ( order one ) linearization .",
    "still another method , ng s characteristic algebra , retains the nonlinear structure of the dga and can be used to distinguish a legendrian @xmath9 knot from its mirror @xcite , but its practical use is more art than algorithm .    in this paper , we develop a new method of extracting nonlinear information from the dga , namely by defining cup and massey product structures  and even @xmath10 and @xmath0 structures  on the linearized cohomology @xmath11 .",
    "the cup product has already appeared implicitly in the fourth author s investigation of duality for the linearized contact homology @xcite , and we reinterpret duality in terms of the cup product in section  [ ssec : duality ] .",
    "though interesting structurally , the cup products that generate the duality pairing are of no use as invariants .",
    "there exist knots , however , with nontrivial  and noncommutative  cup products that do not contribute to the duality pairing .",
    "in fact , all of the product structures produce nontrivial invariants .",

    "we leave as open problems whether or not the massey product structure on @xmath11 determines the third order linearized contact ( co)homology and whether or not the higher order linearized contact ( co)homologies are stronger invariants than the ( first order ) linearized contact ( co)homology .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : after reviewing some basic definitions in section  [ sec : background ] , we define the @xmath0 and product structures in section  [ sec : prod ] .",
    "we show that the product structures are effective invariants in section  [ sec : invariants ] by proving theorem  [ thm : mir - ex ] .",
    "we also establish theorem  [ thm : cup - duality ] in this section . finally , we prove theorem  [ thm : a - infty - high - order ] in section  [ sec : higher - order ] .",

    "let @xmath45 be the set of immersed disks ( modulo smooth reparametrization ) whose boundary lies in @xmath38 .",

    "finally , each disk in @xmath45 contributes a term to @xmath44 consisting of the product of the generators associated to its negative corners , taken in counterclockwise order starting after @xmath40 .",

    "in particular , if @xmath63 , then @xmath66 is a finite - dimensional chain complex with easily computable homology .",
