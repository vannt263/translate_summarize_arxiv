    "the study of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collision has entered a new era with the successful commissioning of the relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven .",
    "this provides an opportunity to verify the possible occurrence of a phase transition from hadronic matter to deconfined quark matter , where partons are the basic degrees of freedom . at the ( lower ) sps energies , an enhanced production of strangeness , considered to be one of the more robust signatures of quark - hadron phase transition",
    "has already been observed  @xcite .",
    "the initial temperatures likely to be attained at rhic and the lhc are expected to be much larger .",
    "a natural question would now be : how quickly is the strangeness equilibrated , if at all ?    in heavy - ion collisions strangeness is produced abundantly through the partonic interactions if the temperature @xmath0 mev , the mass threshold of this semi - heavy flavour .",
    "the extent of its equilibration would however depend upon such details as the thermal and chemical evolution of the partonic system and the life - time of the hot deconfined phase .",
    "it has recently been shown that the chemical equilibration of the light flavours and the gluons slows down due to the radial expansion@xcite .",
    "it should then be expected that the extent of strangeness - equilibration can also be affected if allowances are made for the likely radial expansion of the plasma .",
    "the present work attempts to get answers to this and related questions .",
    "we limit our discussions to the production and evolution of strangeness during the deconfined phase , whose initial conditions are taken from the self screened parton cascade ( sspc ) model  @xcite , which has formed the basis of a large number of related studies in recent times .",
    "an early work in this direction used the initial conditions obtained from the hijing model and considered only a longitudinal expansion  @xcite . in the following",
    "we closely follow this treatment and extend it to include transverse expansion as well .",
    "our paper has been organized as follows : section ii describes briefly the basic equations of the hydrodynamic and chemical evolution of the partonic gas through the partonic reactions in a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional longitudinal expansion and a ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional transverse expansion .",
    "a brief summary is given in section iii .",
    "we start with the assumption that the early ( semi)hard collisions among partons produce a thermalized partonic plasma .",
    "the high @xmath1 partons produced early in the collision , then provide a colour screened environment for the production of partons having low @xmath1 and the high density of the partons launches the landau pomeranchuk migdal ( lpm ) suppression mechanism to eliminate the collinear singularity in parton fragmentation .",
    "this leads to the the so - called self screened parton cascade model  @xcite and can be used to provide plausible initial conditions for the system .",
    "the subsequent chemical equilibration is then attained through reactions of the type @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution of the system is now controlled by the equation for conservation of energy and momentum of an ideal fluid : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy density and @xmath6 is the pressure measured in the rest frame of the fluid .",
    "the four - velocity vector @xmath7 of the fluid satisfies the constraint @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the distribution functions for partons can be scaled through equilibrium distributions as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the be ( fd ) distribution for gluons ( quarks ) , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the nonequilibrium fugacities , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the mass of the parton .",
    "now one can write the number density , energy density and pressure for a partially equilibrated multi - component partonic plasma  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we also have the colour and spin degeneracy @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass of the quark and @xmath23 s are modified bessel functions .",
    "we take strange quark mass as 150 mev . for massless",
    "quarks these expressions simplify considerably and we have @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath27 , which should be valid for negligible net - baryonic density .",
    "this should be a reasonable approximation at rhic and lhc energies",
    ". the speed of sound ( @xmath28 ) can be obtained from @xmath29 we found it to be close to @xmath30 , as we confine ourselves to @xmath31 200 mev .",
    "we must add that several lattice qcd evaluations suggest  @xcite that @xmath32 so that @xmath33 .",
    "for such a situation the cooling of the plasma would be slower  @xcite and thus a much larger time would be available for equilibration .",
    "we solve the hydrodynamic equations ( [ hydro ] ) with the assumption that the system undergoes a boost invariant longitudinal expansion along the @xmath34-axis and a cylindrically symmetric transverse expansion @xcite .",
    "it is then sufficient to solve the problem for @xmath35 .",
    "the chemical equilibration of the species @xmath36 is governed by the master equation@xmath37 where @xmath38 are the rates which propel the system towards chemical equilibration .",
    "the system would be in chemical equilibrium when @xmath39 so that @xmath40 . as mentioned earlier , the dominant chemical reactions through which the chemical equilibration proceed  @xcite are @xmath3 and @xmath41 .",
    "radiative processes involving quarks have substantially smaller cross sections in perturbative qcd , and quarks are less abundant than gluons in the initial phase of the chemical evolution of the parton gas .",
    "other elastic scattering processes ensure maintenance of thermal equilibrium .    under these assumptions",

    "even though they are well - known and used in a large number of studies we reproduce them in table - i for the sake of completeness and an easy reference .",
    "we have chosen an initial fugacity for the strange quarks as half of that for the light quarks as in ref .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption , which is often made , that the number of flavours is @xmath116 if the mass of @xmath91 quark is taken as zero  @xcite .",
    "we show our results for the longitudinal expansion for rhic ( upper panel ) and lhc ( lower panel ) energies in figure 1 . as the additional parton production consumes energy , the temperature of the partonic plasma drops considerably faster than the ideal bjorken s scaling ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , are initial temperature and time of the parton gas ) represented by the dashed line .",
    "we see that like the light quarks and gluon , the production of strange quarks continues till late in the evolution .",
    "we further note that the extent of equilibration for the strange quarks in comparison to that for the light quarks ( @xmath120 ) rises rapidly and once the temperature falls below about @xmath121 mev ( @xmath122 ) it gets more or less frozen by this time .",
    "thus we conclude that the equilibration of strangeness production may imply the existence of quark matter at a temperature of more than about 300 mev for a time of the order of a few fm/@xmath123 .",
    "the other aspects of variation of @xmath124 and @xmath125 have already been discussed by several authors  @xcite .",
    "we do note that the plasma is not fully equilibrated chemically at either rhic or lhc energies by the time the temperature drops below 200 mev .",
    "we do expect that additional quark production may occur due to gluon fragmentations during hadronisation  @xcite leading to a chemically equilibrated hot hadronic matter .    before giving our results for transverse expansion",
    "we need to specify the profile of the initial energy density and the fugacity of the partonic system . following ref .",
    "@xcite we take the initial energy density as @xmath126^{1/2 } \\theta(r - r),\\ ] ] where @xmath127 is the transverse dimension of the system , @xmath128 is the radial distance , and @xmath129 is the `` average '' initial energy density ( see tab .",
    "the profile plays an important role in defining the boundary of the hot and dense deconfined matter and affects the transverse expansion through the introduction of pressure gradients .",
    "we have further taken @xmath130 as before  @xcite .",
    "any other variation will require an additional parameter .",
    "we give our results for the radial variation of @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath120 in figs . 2 and 3 for rhic and lhc energies , respectively , for various times along the constant energy density contours with @xmath133 .",
    "here @xmath134 is defined  @xcite through @xmath135 .",
    "we see that the fugacities attain their highest values near @xmath136 and rise rapidly first and only slowly later in time .",
    "we also see a result unique to chemical evolution with transverse expansion that the fugacities may even start reducing towards the end of the qgp phase when the radial velocity ( gradient ) becomes very large ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for explanation ) .",
    "we can use our results for the radial variation of the energy density and the fugacities obtained here to estimate the extent of partonic equilibration as a function of the initial energy density . comparing results for this from figures 4 and 5",
    "we note that once the energy density is beyond about 2040 gev , the final fugacities for all the partons increase almost linearly with the square of the energy density .",
    "this is a very interesting result .",
    "let us identify the `` local '' energy density at the radius @xmath128 with the average energy density attained in a non - central collision or with a central collision involving lighter nuclei .",
    "recall that the partonic models suggest that the initial temperature attained in such collisions through the production of minijets varies as @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "this should then imply that the extent of equilibration of strangeness produced would rise as @xmath138 , if we can identify @xmath139 with @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the number of participants . in actual cases",
    "the variation may be somewhat modified from this naive expectation due to the considerations of shadowing and jet quenching  @xcite .    if on the other hand the energy densities etc .",
    "are decided by the considerations of parton saturation  @xcite then the initial temperature would vary as @xmath142 and the energy density as @xmath143 . the results of figs . 4 and 5 would then imply that the extent of strangeness equilibration should increase as the number of participants , @xmath144 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a slight reformulation of the parton saturation model ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that a recent analysis  @xcite of centrality dependence of the extent of strangeness equilibration at cern sps energies in pb+pb collisions gives a linear increase for this with the number of participants .",
    "rafelski and coworkers have studied the strangeness equilibration for more than two decades in various details .",
    "we shall refer to only a recent work by these authors  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the following assumptions have been made which are at variance with our works :    1 .",
    "the light quarks and gluons are assumed to have attained chemical equilibrium ( @xmath145 ) when the evolution of strangeness begins .",
    "a boltzmann approximation is used to describe the phase space distribution of @xmath91-quarks .",
    "the flavour changing process , @xmath146 , has been included .",
    "we have neglected them assuming that the gluon fusion process @xmath147 dominates in a chemically undersaturated plasma .",
    "now in the boltzmann limit the evolution of the @xmath91-quark fugacity can be written from ( [ eq15 ] ) as @xmath148 + \\frac{1}{\\tau } = r^s_2\\frac{n_g}{n_s } \\left ( 1-\\frac{\\lambda_s^2}{\\lambda_g^2}\\right ) .",

    "we see that the @xmath150 and @xmath151 terms in the left hand side here are absent in eq.(11 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the above discussion .",
    "one can thus see that the extent of strangeness equilibration attained in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite is much larger than in the present work .    as a further check",
    ", we have repeated our calculations , assuming @xmath152 with the same energy density as before , ( see table i ) and further taking @xmath153 as in the work of ref .",
    "we found that now our parameter @xmath154 rises to about 0.4 at rhic energies and up to 0.72 at lhc energies , for the case of longitudinal expansion ( see fig .",
    "when the transverse expansion is allowed these numbers reduce to 0.66 at lhc energies and 0.38 at rhic energies , respectively .",
    "we thus realize that the extent of equilibration of strangeness depends sensitively on the initial conditions and also on the evolution mechanism .",
    "wong has studied  @xcite the chemical equilibration of plasma essentially in a formalism similar to that used in the present work , but only with longitudinal expansions .",
    "his values for @xmath155 are also much larger .",
    "we have studied the evolution and production of strangeness through the partonic interactions in a chemically equilibrating and expanding multi - component partonic gas with the initial conditions obtained from sspc model .",
    "we find that most of the strange quarks are produced when the temperature is still more than about 300 mev ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "thus a chemically equilibrated plasma is expected to imply the existence of qgp phase for a duration of several fm/@xmath123 .",
    "we also find approximately that the extent of strangeness equilibration rises linearly with the square of the initial energy density within our approach .",
    "this may help us to obtain the scaling of the initial energy density with the number of participants and distinguish between the minijet and the partonic saturation models of parton production .",
    "it is rather interesting that the charged particle multiplicity in au + au collision at @xmath157 gev measured by the phenix collaboration  @xcite shows a behaviour which is a superposition of two terms , a linear increase with the number of participants and a linear increase with the number of collisions ( which varies as @xmath158 ) .",
