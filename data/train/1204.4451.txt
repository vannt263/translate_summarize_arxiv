    "it is now widely accepted that the central engine of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) consists of an accreting supermassive black hole ( lynden - bell 1969 ; rees 1984 ) . in this framework , the primary x - ray emission of agn is produced through the comptonization of disc photons in a corona of relativistic electrons ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ) , and can be usually described by means of a simple power law . with the increasing quality of the available x - ray spectra , the presence of other components has been progressively revealed .",
    "for instance , in sources not affected by intrinsic absorption , the soft x - ray emission is not invariably accounted for by just extrapolating the main power - law trend to lower energies .",
    "the additional component observed below 2  kev is known as soft excess ( after arnaud et al .",
    "1985 ) , and characterizes a significant fraction ( possibly major ; scott et al . 2011 ) of x - ray unobscured agn .",
    "the physical origin of this feature has to be linked to the properties of the accretion flow , but still represents a controversial issue in spite of the various models proposed in the recent years .",
    "+ in terms of spectral shape , the smoothness of the soft excess is consistent with several interpretations .",
    "direct thermal emission from a standard geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) is usually ruled out through a basic temperature argument , as most agn discs should be too cool to contribute to the x - rays ; yet , given that @xmath0 , it might become important for high accretion rates ( @xmath1 ) and relatively low black hole masses ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is the case for narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) , i.e. the sources within the type 1 population that show the lower full width at half - maximum in their optical permitted lines ( fwhm h@xmath3 km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "as the line width distribution is continuous , the exact boundary is somewhat arbitrary ; none the less , nls1s represent a well - defined subclass with respect to their broad - line counterparts ( bls1s ) due to many distinctive features ( e.g. grupe et al .",
    "in particular , the steep x - ray continuum and the prominent soft excess reveal a close similarity with the high / soft spectral states of black - hole binaries ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) , and further support the speculation of nearly eddington accretion rates in nls1s ( pounds , done & osborne 1995 ) . on the other hand , the usual detection of a soft excess also in bls1s ( e.g. porquet et al .",
    "2004 ) implies that the underlying phenomenon is really widespread .",
    "+ an increase of the disc effective temperature , following the comptonization of the seed photons in a _ cold _",
    "( @xmath5 kev ) , optically thick plasma , may give rise to the observed excess ( e.g. done et al .",
    "this up - scattering is associated with the disc photosphere itself ; a tail of high - energy , non - thermal particles ( coppi 1999 ) can account for the hard power - law component as well . however , the temperature of the putative _ soft _ corona turns out to be virtually constant over several orders of magnitude in black hole mass ( gierliski & done 2004 ) .",
    "the same problem affects the blackbody component in the purely thermal scenario ( crummy et al .",
    "such a universal energy hints at some kind of atomic process .",
    "reflection off the surface of the accretion disc is one of the viable explanations ( fabian et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this picture , the primary x - rays go through substantial reprocessing in the photoionized upper layers of the disc , and emerge as a smooth continuum due to relativistic blurring in the strong gravity regime .",
    "alternatively , it was suggested that the soft excess is a fake emission feature , mimicked by a broad absorption trough at @xmath625 kev ascribed to partially ionized gas along the line of sight ( e.g. middleton , done & gierliski 2007 ) .",
    "the detailed simulations of line - driven accretion disc winds are not fully consistent with the observational evidence , though ( schurch , done & proga 2009 ) .",
    "+ this notwithstanding , warm absorption is very common among type 1 objects , and can hinder the characterization of the soft excess . therefore , the ideal targets to investigate the nature of this component are the brightest seyferts with negligible intrinsic obscuration across their entire spectrum . in this respect ,",
    "the nls1 galaxy tonantzintla  s180 ( @xmath7 , fwhm h@xmath8 @xmath9 km  s@xmath4 ) is one of the most suitable sources . owing to a very low galactic column density ( @xmath10  @xmath11 ; kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) , ton  s180 was the brightest agn detected by the _ euve _ satellite ( wisotzki et al . 1995 ; vennes et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this flux measurement , together with the steep soft x - ray spectra obtained with _ rosat",
    "_ pointed observations ( fink et al . 1997 ) , implied a huge emission peak in the extreme ultraviolet ( uv ) regime .",
    "based on an extensive multiwavelength campaign , turner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derived the broad - band spectral energy distribution of ton  s180 , and confirmed that the bulk of its energy output is released in the @xmath610100 ev range . if present , any x - ray warm absorber is either very weak or highly ionized ( turner et .",
    "al 2001 ; raska et al . 2004 ) , and is not expected to modify significantly the shape of the soft excess .",
    "+ consequently , ton  s180 belongs to the limited sample of sources for which it is possible to probe the physical conditions in the very inner regions , through a comprehensive study of the intrinsic x - ray emission .",
    "disc reflection has been shown to represent a basic ingredient in many of them , e.g. mrk  335 ( larsson et al . 2008 ) , mrk  478 ( zoghbi , fabian & gallo 2008 ) , fairall  9 ( schmoll et al .",
    "2009 ; emmanoulopoulos et al . 2011 ) , ark  120 ( nardini et al . 2011 ) .",
    "indeed , the application of a self - consistent , dual - reflector model over the whole 0.540  kev energy range proved to be highly effective in our recent analysis of the prototypical _ bare _",
    "bls1 galaxy ark  120 . due to its striking properties and its nls1 nature , hence ton",
    "s180 is a perfect target to further test a similar scenario . with this aim , here we review its three highest - quality x - ray spectra taken by _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ between 2000 and 2006 .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the observation log and data reduction .",
    "the spectral analysis is presented in section 3 , while section 4 concerns the discussion of our results and their main implications .",
    "conclusions and final remarks are drawn in section 5 .",
    "ton  s180 was targeted by _ xmm - newton _ twice , on 2000 december 14 and 2002 june 30 .",
    "no significant background flaring occurred during the two observations , resulting in a good integration time for the epic pn camera ( operated in the small - window mode ) of 20.6 and 12.6  ks , respectively .",
    "a deeper monitoring by _ suzaku _ took place on 2006 december 912 , with the source at the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) nominal position ; the net exposure was @xmath6120 ks for the xis and 102  ks for the hard x - ray detector ( hxd / pin ) .",
    "the reduction of event files and the generation of response matrices were carried out following the standard procedures , by using the latest versions of the sas and heasoft packages for the _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ data sets .",
    "the source spectra were extracted from circular regions centred on the target , with radii of 35  arcsec for _ xmm - newton _ images and 4  arcmin for _ suzaku _ , while the background was evaluated over adjacent regions free of significant contamination .",
    "the source and background spectra from the two front - illuminated ( fi ) xis detectors ( xis0 and xis3 ) were eventually merged together .",
    "+ ton  s180 was marginally detected also by the hxd / pin above 10 kev .",
    "the source count rate actually amounts to less than @xmath65 per cent of the total collected events at 1540  kev .",
    "this implies that the reproducibility of the instrumental non x - ray background ( nxb ) , due to charged particles and simulated by the hxd science team with a nominal uncertainty of @xmath63 per cent , may have a substantial impact on the scaling factor between the pin and xis spectra , and consequently on the spectral modelling .",
    "we have tested the nxb accuracy by extracting the pin spectrum during the earth occultation of the source .",
    "we will discuss the selection of the most appropriate nxb file and the implications of this choice in the following ( section  4.3 ) .",
    "+ the results presented in this work concern the 0.510  kev energy range of the epic pn and xis fi spectra ( from which the 1.751.95 kev interval was excluded due to calibration uncertainties ) , while only the 1830  kev band has been conservatively taken into account for the marginal hxd / pin detection .",
    "the mos2 and the back - illuminated ( bi ) xis1 spectra have been checked throughout for consistency .",
    "the xspec v12.7 fitting package has been employed in the spectral analysis . in order to allow the use of @xmath12 minimization , and",
    "considering that the x - ray steepness of ton  s180 leads to non negligible noise at the higher energies , we have re - binned the background - subtracted spectra to a 5@xmath13 significance in each energy channel .",
    "a minimum of 50 counts per bin was instead adopted for the pin data .",
    "all the uncertainties quoted below correspond to the 90 per cent confidence range ( @xmath14 ) for the single parameter of interest ; fluxes and related quantities ( reflection strengths , equivalent widths ) are given at the 1@xmath13 level .",
    "with the exception of the shorter _ xmm - newton _ exposure , the x - ray observations of ton  s180 under review have already been analysed in great detail in previous dedicated works ( vaughan et al .",
    "2002 ; takahashi et al .",
    "these studies explored a wide range of different models to understand the nature of the broad - band x - ray emission of ton  s180 , and specifically of its soft excess .",
    "the strength and shape of this feature is visually indicated by the data / model ratio plotted in fig .",
    "[ rp ] , obtained by fitting a power law over the 25  kev spectral range .",
    "the outcome is clearly model - dependent , but the low - energy upturn as well as complex iron signatures are evident . with no loss of accuracy , we have chosen a common hard photon index to assess the magnitude of the soft excess ; its luminosity of @xmath62.5@xmath15 erg  s@xmath4 represents at least @xmath62025 per cent of the observed 0.510  kev emission . to achieve a straightforward , quantitative comparison among the three spectra of ton  s180 and their general properties , we have first adopted a phenomenological model consisting of a broken power law modified by neutral absorption",
    ", whose column density has been frozen to the galactic value throughout this work ( ` tbabs ` cross sections and solar abundances from wilms , allen & mccray 2000 were assumed ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ t1 ] , and show that this baseline model provides an acceptable description of the data .",
    "both the hard x - ray slope and the energy of the break are very similar in the three cases , and formally consistent within the error bars .",
    "a larger difference is found for the soft photon index , which follows the changes in the strength of the soft excess . in spite of a cumulative @xmath16 , clear structures in the residuals",
    "remain all across the spectra , and mainly in the region of iron k - shell emission and below @xmath61.5 kev .",
    "+    2.33 , 2.37 and 2.34 ) are virtually identical and consistent with each other .",
    "though model - dependent , this sketch reveals the most critical points of the detailed spectral analysis , i.e. the accuracy of instrumental calibrations at the lower energies and the large noise above @xmath65",

    "@xmath17 : soft photon index ; @xmath18 : hard photon index ; @xmath19 : break energy ( kev ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     closely related to the measure of the black hole spin is the presence of a broad iron emission feature , which has been regularly detected in all the x - ray observations of ton  s180 . within a pure reflection frame ,",
    "both the soft excess and the broad component in the iron k@xmath20 line profile arise from the innermost regions of the accretion disc . in a broad - band spectral analysis ,",
    "the best - fitting blurring and ionization parameters are mainly driven by the much larger statistical weight of the soft excess .",
    "a general agreement is expected when the iron feature is fitted separately , though . as mentioned above , this is not always the case , and could represent one of the most serious issues with the reflection scenario .",
    "some residual structure in the @xmath667  kev region is apparent in ton  s180 as well , especially in the two _ xmm - newton _ observations ( fig .",
    "we then focused on the 38 kev spectral range , and applied a simple model consisting of a power law plus a ` laor ` profile .",
    "this allows us to put tighter , independent constraints on the significance of the broad iron line , even if some of its properties have to be assumed .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ t3 ] . by considering its equivalent width",
    ", the line is detected at the 1.7@xmath13 confidence level at most .",
    "this is consistent with all the previous observational records , included those obtained by _",
    "asca _ and _ bepposax_. the profile is very broad but it is difficult to appreciate any asymmetry due to the moderate prominence . in both",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ spectra an equivalent fit can be recovered by replacing the disc line with a gaussian of width @xmath21 . in a keplerian frame , this entails a fwhm broadening of @xmath64  @xmath22 km s@xmath4 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath65060  @xmath23 from a black hole of 10@xmath24 .",
    "interestingly , this is the location of the reflecting clouds that have been recently proposed as the source of the uv emission peak in agn ( lawrence 2011 ) .",
    "+ in conclusion , the broad iron line in ton  s180 is not sufficiently strong to prove its consistency with the soft excess , probably because of the high ionization of the reflecting gas .",
    "the same argument is invoked to explain the lack / faintness of narrow iron lines , whose detection would likely cancel out the observed residuals .",
    "this hints at a range of ionization states across the different spatial scales much more complex than the one simulated in our analysis .",
    "none the less , the tentative discrepancy between the two main disc features remains a pivotal issue of blurred reflection models , and will be addressed in detail in a future work .",
    "the analysis of time variability and its dependence with energy is a powerful , alternative tool either to confirm or to discard any physical interpretation based on spectral modelling . in very favourable conditions",
    ", this complementary approach can even be conclusive in distinguishing between reflection and comptonization scenarios .",
    "this possible discrimination relies upon the detection of time lags among the different x - ray energy bands .",
    "in particular , a delay between the hard x - ray variations and the soft ones at a given time - scale is regarded as the typical reverberation signature , corresponding to the light travel time from the illuminating source to the reflector and back .",
    "evidence for _ negative _ ( soft ) lags has rapidly grown in recent times ( fabian et al .",
    "2009 ; zoghbi et al .",
    "2010 ; de marco et al .",
    "2012 ) , but none was found in ton  s180 down to the limit of 500 s ( vaughan et al . 2002 ) .",
    "+ the timing properties of ton  s180 have already been explored in the dedicated studies mentioned above . in fig .",
    "[ tv ] we reproduce the fractional rms variability amplitude ( @xmath25 ) of the source : this is an indicator of the intrinsic _ noise _ after the measurement uncertainties have been subtracted ( e.g. edelson et al .",
    "2002 ; vaughan et al . 2003 ) .",
    "for ease of comparison among the three observations here we have defined only five energy bands , but our findings are in full agreement with previous works where a finer sampling was adopted .",
    "although the absolute values of @xmath25 are different , roughly scaling in proportion to the length of the single observations , , with @xmath262 ( e.g. lawrence & papadakis 1993 ) , hence the source variability is mostly sensitive to the longer time - scales . ]",
    "the variability patterns are reasonably well matched . while there is no appreciable trend with energy for the two deeper data sets , implying that the spectrum varies in first approximation as a whole , the shorter _ xmm - newton _ monitoring shows a provisional decline . rather than physical ,",
    "this is presumably a statistical / systematic effect .",
    "because of the spectral steepness , the count rate gets rapidly smaller and the weight of poisson noise in the hard bands is considerably larger .",
    "this might result in a decrease of @xmath25 , highly accentuated by both the short exposure and the low flux state characterizing this observation , which lead to the detection of only marginally positive excess variance above 2 kev .",
    "on the other hand , a genuine drop of @xmath25 with energy would be apparently in contrast with a reflection context .",
    "in fact , if the soft emission is a form of reprocessing of hard x - rays , the lower energies should reveal somewhat smoothed variations .",
    "such behaviour is expected whenever the emission in a definite band can be plainly associated with a dominant reflection component , and also applies to the iron region ( e.g. vaughan & fabian 2004 ) and the higher energies , especially in the presence of a prominent compton hump ( which is actually not the case for ton  s180 , see below ) .",
    "+ in general , however , the dependence of @xmath25 with energy does not necessarily have any intuitive interpretation .",
    "both the direct emission and its blurred reflection counterpart yield a broad - band contribution , which gives rise to the typical soft excess plus hard power law shape ( see fig .  [ mc ] ) .",
    "under extreme gravity conditions , their interplay may have quite complicated manifestations in the time domain .",
    "this can be easily verified by rendering explicit the two components within the definition of excess variance itself , and keeping in mind that the x - ray illumination experienced by the disc is much more intense than the one received at infinity . as for ton  s180 , where severe light bending does not seem to be a decisive ingredient , the continuum irradiating the disc is almost identical to the observed , direct power law .",
    "the absence of time delays is still consistent with a source height of several gravitational radii , tightly corresponding to the values inferred from the spectral analysis for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the two perspectives are then compatible with the transitional regime identified by miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) , hinting at a stationary source of varying luminosity .",
    "a distance above the disc @xmath30 ( with a nearly constant reflection opposed to a markedly variable power law ) would instead deliver clearer structures in @xmath25 as well as detectable spectral changes .",
    "this minimal scatter in the variability pattern ( see ponti et al .",
    "2011 ) has a couple of remarkable implications .",
    "first , it justifies a time - averaged spectral analysis like the one performed in this work , as this is fairly representative of the physical state of ton  s180 during each observation .",
    "second , it involves a tight causal connection between the soft and hard x - ray emission , which again fits into a reflection scenario , even if the details are partially obscure .",
    "also some kind of complex , non - thermal comptonization process may be able to account for these properties in a self - consistent way , so we argue that this other option can not be completely ruled out .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the detection of ton  s180 beyond 10  kev is quite critical .",
    "since the hxd / pin is a collimating instrument with no imaging capabilities , the background level can not be derived from the data records themselves . while the cosmic contribution has been simulated according to standard spectral forms ( e.g. boldt 1987 ) , a tuned model of the particle non x - ray background ( nxb )",
    "was provided by the hxd science team . whenever the target is very faint , as for ton  s180",
    ", the pin count rate is dominated by the nxb .",
    "the accuracy of its reproducibility ( typically within @xmath635 per cent ; kokubun et al .",
    "2007 ) is therefore a major factor of uncertainty , which mainly affects the absolute normalization of the high - energy emission of the source . in the present case ,",
    "the pin statistical weight is virtually negligible , and the best fit is driven by the xis spectrum regardless of the model . as a result",
    ", we found a systematic pin offset . by leaving it free to vary ,",
    "we obtain a pin / xis cross calibration of @xmath62.6(@xmath31 ) , against a recommended value of 1.16 .",
    "such disparity can be actually explained once the nxb uncertainty is taken into account .",
    "this point has been already addressed in great detail by takahashi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who eventually introduced a compton - thick partial - covering absorber to retain the nominal nxb .",
    "the latter solution is not strictly required , though .",
    "moreover , it implies a considerable fine tuning in terms of both column density and covering fraction to reproduce the high - energy emission without modifying the spectral shape below 10 kev .",
    "the presence of this heavy absorption component is not envisaged in a _ bare _",
    "seyfert galaxy .",
    "yet the putative hard excess can not be interpreted like a poorly modelled reflection hump , as suggested for ngc  1365 ( risaliti et al .",
    "2009 ; walton et al .",
    "+ we did not pursue this issue further .",
    "instead , we extracted the earth - occulted pin spectrum to test the nxb accuracy .",
    "this is an observational measure of the instrumental background , and was employed throughout our analysis .",
    "the outcome is shown in fig .",
    "there is still some discrepancy , but now the best scaling factor would be @xmath61.9(@xmath32 ) , broadly consistent with the usual values ; the probability of chance improvement following the loss of one d.o.f .",
    "is as high as 25 per cent .",
    "the existence of a hard excess in ton  s180 remains somewhat controversial then , and can only be revealed by forthcoming x - ray missions as _ nustar _ and _ astro - h_.",
    "we have presented the joint spectral analysis of the three highest - quality x - ray observations of the nls1 galaxy ton  s180 , obtained by _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku_. this is one of the brightest sources with negligible intrinsic absorption , and represents an ideal target to investigate the nature of a striking x - ray spectral feature like the soft excess .",
    "even though the observations under review cover a period of several years , the 0.510  kev emission of ton  s180 does not exhibit dramatic variations . in first approximation",
    ", the spectral shape can be described by a broken power law .",
    "the hard photon index ( @xmath332.3 ) is almost constant , with an ordinary value among nls1s ; the soft one is steeper ( @xmath34 ) and more variable , following the strength of the soft excess below @xmath62 kev .",
    "a broad iron fluorescence line hints at reflection from highly ionized material close to the central black hole .",
    "however , this feature is not very prominent , and falls in a noisy region owing to the steepness of the primary x - ray continuum .",
    "conversely , the soft excess emission is remarkable in both strength and shape , challenging a possible origin from the inner disc as a blurred reflection signature . in order to probe the soundness of this scenario ,",
    "we have applied a self - consistent model that provides a successful description of all the different data sets by allowing for a dual - reflector geometry .",
    "the high - ionization component ( @xmath352.8 ) is associated with the disc , and accounts for most of the soft excess .",
    "also involved is a much fainter , neutral component , arising from the reprocessing of the primary radiation at much larger distance from the x - ray source .",
    "the accretion flow extends down to @xmath36 , and this is a compelling evidence in favour of a rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "the substantial degeneracy among the key parameters prevents an accurate determination of the spin and a complete characterization of the central engine , none the less the overall picture is clearly established . +",
    "this work , together with our previous study of the bls1 galaxy ark  120 , confirms that reflection models are extremely effective in reproducing a wide range of x - ray spectral properties .",
    "a uniform analysis of a sizable sample of similar objects is anyway mandatory to uncover the expected correlations ( e.g. between soft excess and broad iron feature , reflection fraction and black hole spin ) and rule out any fine tuning ( e.g. of the disc ionization state and/or inclination ) .",
    "even this kind of effort might not be conclusive if the soft excess is a complex , non - linear combination of all the physical processes that take place in the central regions of active galaxies . in the absence of a universal explanation",
    ", only the next - generation x - ray satellites would have the capabilities to disentangle the different contributions from thermal emission , reflection , scattering and ( possibly ) absorption .",

    "<S> , we review from a reflection perspective the three highest - quality x - ray observations of the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy tonantzintla  s180 , obtained by _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku_. the x - ray spectrum of ton  s180 shows only moderate variations over a time span of several years , suggesting that the same physical process accounts for the bulk of the broad - band x - ray emission at the different epochs , and that the properties of the x - ray source are fairly stable . </S>",
    "<S> we have successfully applied in our spectral analysis a dual - reflector model , consisting of two separate components : one arises from the surface of the accretion disc , is highly ionized and blurred by relativistic effects ; the other is cold , quite faint , and can be associated with a distant reprocessor . due to the strength and the nearly power - law shape of its soft excess emission , ton  </S>",
    "<S> s180 is one of the most challenging sources to test the x - ray reflection scenario . in this work </S>",
