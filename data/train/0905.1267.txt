    "a great deal of attention has been devoted recently to the subject of perfect state transfer ( pst ) in quantum networks .",
    "since an actual quantum processor  would require , in fact , the ability to transfer quantum information between spatially separated interacting systems composing a network , protocols have been established for pst in many different and general contexts . among the several interesting theoretical contributions , aiming to advance the understanding and eventual implementation of a quantum processor ,",
    "the construction of effective two - qubit gates from pst between distant nodes in engineered bosonic and fermionic networks was proposed @xcite .",
    "a general formalism of the problem of pst in networks of any topology and coupling configuration was also developed @xcite .",
    "focusing on spin chains , pst has been pursued in networks extending beyond the nearest - neighbor couplings @xcite , and a class of qubit networks allowing pst of any state in a fixed period of time has been devised @xcite .",
    "the problem of the scaling of errors ( arising from network nonidealities ) with the length of the channel connecting the nodes has been discussed @xcite . in this connection , a protocol for arbitrary pst in the presence of random fluctuations in the coupling strengths of a spin chain",
    "was reported @xcite .",
    "the entanglement dynamics in spin chains subject to noise and disorder has also been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . regarding pst in networks of harmonic oscillators ,",
    "a comprehensive analysis of this subject has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a protocol for high - efficiency transfer of quantum entanglements in translation - invariant quantum chains has been proposed @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the achievements with spin chains , there have been no proposals , until this paper , for arbitrary pst through a network of nonideal harmonic oscillators .",
    "since pst is achieved by appropriate tuning of the intermode coupling and the frequencies of the systems composing the network , the search for the general rules governing these adjustments is of crucial interest . in this regard ,",
    "it is worth noting that the general recipe presented in ref .",
    "@xcite contrasts with the procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite where a degenerate chain of oscillators is considered : all oscillators having the same frequency and interacting with each other with the same coupling strength .",
    "the lack of pst in ref .",
    "@xcite is compensated by a more realistic possibility of implementation of a translation - invariant network , apart from the high efficiency transfer operation reported .",
    "we observe that in the present contribution we also derive general conditions for pst , with the advantage that they are easier to handle mathematically than those outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as well as in spin chains ,",
    "significant advances have been made recently in bosonic networks @xcite .",
    "a general treatment of a network of coupled dissipative quantum harmonic oscillators has been presented recently , for an arbitrary topology , i.e. , irrespective of the way the oscillators are coupled together , the strength of their couplings , and their natural frequencies @xcite . regarding the dissipative mechanism ,",
    "two different scenarios are considered in ref .",
    "@xcite : a more realistic in which each oscillator is coupled to its own reservoir and another with all the network oscillators coupled to a common reservoir .",
    "within such a general treatment of dissipation , the emergence of relaxation- and decoherence - free subspaces in networks of weakly and strongly coupled resonators has also been addressed @xcite .",
    "we finally mention the proposition of a quantum memory for the preservation of superposition states against decoherence by their evolution in appropriate topologies of such dissipative bosonic networks @xcite .",
    "building on the achievements mentioned above , in the present study we develop a protocol for quasi - perfect state transfer ( qpst ) in a linear network of dissipative oscillators . more specifically , we envisage the transfer of a state between ideal sender and receiver oscillators through a linear chain of nonideal transmitter oscillators . by analogy with refs .",
    "@xcite , here we again adopt the general and more realistic scenario where each transmitter oscillator is coupled to a distinct reservoir .",
    "therefore , our goal resembles that of arbitrary pst in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , instead of fluctuations in the couplings of a spin chain , we deal with the fluctuations injected by each of the reservoirs coupled to the transmitter oscillators . anticipating our strategy to achieve qpst despite these sources of nonideality , we adjust the frequency of the sender and the receiver oscillators to be significantly out of resonance with that of the transmitters ; within such an arrangement the state to be transferred occupies the transmitter oscillators only virtually , weakening the undesired effects of their decay mechanisms .",
    "we point out that the recent proposal of a variety of resources for wiring up quantum systems @xcite lends a strongly realistic bias to the possibility of controlling the transfer of information in quantum networks .",
    "following the mastering of the manipulation of the interaction between single atoms and vibrating modes of high - q cavities @xcite and trapped ions @xcite , circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics and photonic crystals seem to enhance the ability to transfer quantum information to a level enabling the implementation of a logic processor @xcite . in this connection , the elaboration of schemes to circumvent the noise injection in the processes of pst in networks of coupled nonideal quantum systems is indispensable , enabling protocols for fault - tolerant information transfer and deepenning our understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena such as entanglement and decoherence .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , by analogy with the developments presented in ref @xcite ,",
    "we introduce our model in which two ideal oscillators are connected by a transmission line of nonideal oscillators .",
    "the master equation describing the network dynamics is presented , together with its solution . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we present a criterion for pst ( qpst ) in ideal ( nonideal ) networks of harmonic oscillators , together with a particular application where the sets of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ensuring pst are derived .",
    "our criterion relies on the definition of matrix @xmath2 , describing the evolution of the system , which serves two purposes : to ensure pst and to compute the exchange time @xmath3 .",
    "the analytical treatment of qpst in small nonideal linear networks of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 oscillators are given in section [ sec4 ] . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we apply numerical procedures to extend our results to large numbers of nonideal transmitters , providing a comprehensive analysis of all the network parameters involved and demonstrating the robustness of our model . finally , we present our concluding remarks in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "before introducing our model for pst , we first revisit the developments in ref .",

    "it is worth noting again that , confining ourselves to a linear dissipative network , the adopted strategy of considering the ideal sender and receiver oscillators significantly out of resonance with the nonideal transmitters , ensures qpst despite the nonidealities of the transmitter line .",

    "the derivation of an analytical expression for @xmath183 in the general case of any @xmath8 is not an easy task . as @xmath8 increases , we find that an involved dependence of the second - order correction @xmath184 on @xmath8 begins to play a significant role .",
    "although the task of identifying this dependence is still a compelling challenge , in the present paper we analyze qpst for large values of @xmath8 numerically , using expression ( [ f ] ) to obtain the fidelity of the transfer process .",

    "we first observe , as expected , that the exchange time @xmath183 increases proportionally to @xmath8 , being around @xmath196 for the case of @xmath172 , in agreement with the analytical result computed in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) .",
    "moreover , as the state to be transferred occupies the virtual nonideal channel for a time interval proportional to @xmath8 , the fidelity of the transfer process decreases with @xmath8 , as displayed in fig .",
    "1 . in fact , for the choice of decay rate outlined above , we show that the fidelity of the transfer process is about unity for the cases @xmath172 and @xmath197 , beginning to exhibit a significant decrease from @xmath198 . we have not found any sensible decrease of the fidelity for the cases @xmath172 and @xmath197 , even for time intervals many orders of magnitude longer than the exchange time .",
    "the shaded regions in the figures follow from the strong oscillations of the probability @xmath187 , coming from the natural frequencies of the oscillators .",

    "as expected , we verify that the exchange times are exactly those of the associated case in fig .",

    "the magnitudes of these secondary peaks follow from the probability of finding the superposition state in the receiver oscillator at the recurrence time , given by @xmath203   = 1/2 $ ] , where @xmath117 and @xmath204 represent the superposition states standing in the first oscillator at @xmath205 and in the @xmath8th one at @xmath206 . in fig .",

    "as expected , in the recurrence time the superposition state recurs back to the sender oscillator .    in fig .",
    "3(a ) we adopt the same parameters as in fig .",
    "1(b ) , except for the smaller value @xmath208 , to illustrate the expected increase in the exchange time .",
    "an interesting feature of this figure is that the fidelity of the transfer process does not depends on @xmath83 , despite the increase in the exchange time , which is around 7 orders of magnitude greater than in fig .",
    "these features are reinforced in fig .",
    "3(b ) where , again with the same parameters as in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we consider the limiting case @xmath209 , which results in a formidable increase in the exchange time of around 28 orders of magnitude , still preserving the fidelity .    with the same parameters as in fig .",

    "4(b ) we use the same parameters as in fig .",
    "4(a ) , except for the coherent state @xmath211 , to show that a larger excitation of the state to be transferred results in a smaller fidelity of the process . in fact",
    ", the decoherence time of a quantum state varies inversely with its excitation , in accordance with the correspondence principle .    finally , to illustrate the advantage of our tunneling - based scheme for state transfer over those where the transfer proceeds non - virtually through all the transmitter oscillators , in fig .",
    "5 we plot the exchange probability @xmath187 against @xmath188 for the case where the sets of parameters @xmath95 and @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) are utilized .",
    "assuming , as in fig .",
    "1(a ) , @xmath212 and @xmath195 , we find that , whereas the fidelity of our tunneling scheme is about unity up to at least 10 times the exchange time @xmath213 , that for the case of fig .",
    "5 decays to around zero for @xmath214 .",
    "in this work we have discussed the problem of state transfer in a linear chain of quantum dissipative harmonic oscillators .",
    "assuming the first and last oscillators to be on - resonant with each other and significantly off - resonant with the transmitter channel running from the second to the last - but - one oscillator we take advantage of the tunneling effect to circumvent the decoherence during the transmission process .",
    "we have assumed ideal sender and receiver oscillators connected by nonideal transmitters .",
    "apart from the significant improvement of the fidelity of our quasi - perfect transfer process compared to those where the transfer proceeds through a non - virtual mechanism , we have presented additional contributions to state transferring processes .    on the basis of a recently presented general treatment of a network of coupled dissipative quantum harmonic oscillators ,",
    "we have also derived a general criterion for pst , whatever the topology of the network , which is applied here to the particular case of a linear chain .",
    "our criterion , given essentially by the commutation relation between the network hamiltonian @xmath53 and the matrix @xmath215 connecting the initial states of the network to those at the exchange time ( when the transfer process is supposed to be accomplished ) , has the advantage of being easier to handle mathematically than that outlined in ref .",
    "in fact , the matrix @xmath2 , defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be used for two purposes : to ensure pst ( or qpst ) and to compute the exchange time @xmath151 , which can also be controlled by manipulating the coupling between the transmitter oscillators . as a matter of fact",
    ", a large detuning between the on - resonant and the off - resonant oscillators ensures not only a high fidelity for the transfer process but also a significant prolongation of the exchange time . in this connection ,",
    "an increase in the coupling between the transmitter oscillators acts to shorten such delays .",
    "the role played by each of the network parameters is analyzed in details in a set of figures presented after the formal development of our scheme .",
    "we thus propose that the tunneling scheme presented here can be useful for transferring quantum states between distant nodes of a quantum circuit without their undergoing a significant coherence decay .",
    "evidently , the control of the network parameters , such as the natural frequencies and coupling strengths of the oscillators , still represents a sensitive issue to be overcome experimentally .",
    "we also point out that recent developments in circuit qed and photonic crystals signal realistic platforms for the experimental implementation of our proposed scheme .",
