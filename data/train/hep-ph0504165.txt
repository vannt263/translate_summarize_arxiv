    "the solar angle @xmath11 is large , @xmath12 , but certainly not maximal ( by about 5 - 6 @xmath13 now @xcite ) .",
    "the third angle @xmath14 is strongly limited , mainly by the chooz experiment , and has at present a @xmath8 upper limit given by about @xmath15 .    in spite of this experimental progress",
    "there are still many alternative routes in constructing models of neutrino masses .",
    "this variety is mostly due to the considerable ambiguities that remain .",
    "first of all , it is essential to know whether the lsnd signal @xcite , which has not been confirmed by karmen @xcite and is currently being double - checked by miniboone @xcite , will be confirmed or will be excluded .",
    "if lsnd is right we probably need at least four light neutrinos ; if not we can do with only the three known ones , as we assume here in the following .",
    "as neutrino oscillations only determine mass squared differences a crucial missing input is the absolute scale of neutrino masses ( within the existing limits from terrestrial experiments and cosmology @xcite,@xcite ) . even for three neutrinos the pattern of the neutrino mass spectrum is still undetermined",
    ": it can be approximately degenerate , or of the inverse hierarchy type or normally hierarchical . given for granted that neutrinos are majorana particles",
    ", their masses can still arise either from the see - saw mechanism or from generic dimension - five non renormalizable operators .    at a more direct level",
    ", we do not know how small the mixing angle @xmath14 is and how close to maximal is @xmath0 .",
    "one can make a distinction between `` normal '' and `` special '' models . for normal models",
    "@xmath0 is not too close to maximal and @xmath14 is not too small , typically a small power of the self - suggesting order parameter @xmath16 , with @xmath17 .",
    "special models are those where some symmetry or dynamical feature assures in a natural way the near vanishing of @xmath14 and/or of @xmath18 .",
    "normal models are conceptually more economical and much simpler to construct .",
    "we expect that experiment will eventually find that @xmath14 is not too small and that @xmath0 is sizably not maximal .",
    "but if , on the contrary , either @xmath14 very small or @xmath0 very close to maximal will emerge from experiment , then theory will need to cope with this fact .",
    "thus it is interesting to conceive and explore dynamical structures that could lead to special models in a natural way .",
    "we want to discuss here some particularly special models where both @xmath14 and @xmath18 exactly vanish .",
    "then the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath19 ( @xmath20,@xmath21,@xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , in the basis of diagonal charged leptons , is given by , apart from sign convention redefinitions : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 stand for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "it is much simpler to write natural models of this type with @xmath26 small and thus many such attempts are present in the early literature .",
    "more recently , given the experimental value of @xmath11 , the more complicated case of @xmath26 large was also attacked , using non abelian symmetries , either continuous or discrete @xcite . in many examples the invoked symmetries are",
    "particularly ad hoc and/or no sufficient attention is devoted to corrections from higher dimensional operators that can spoil the pattern arranged at tree level and to the highly non trivial vacuum alignment problems that arise if naturalness is required also at the level of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "an interesting special case of eq .",
    "( [ ufi1 ] ) is obtained for @xmath29 , i.e. the so - called tri - bimaximal or harrison - perkins - scott mixing pattern ( hps ) @xcite , with the entries in the second column all equal to @xmath30 in absolute value : @xmath31 this matrix is a good approximation to present data .",
    ", to be compared with the latest experimental determination @xcite : @xmath32 .",
    "] it would be interesting to find a natural and appealing scheme that leads to this matrix with good accuracy .",
    "in fact this is a most special model where not only @xmath14 and @xmath18 vanish but also @xmath11 assumes a particular value .",
    "clearly , in a natural realization of this model , a very constraining and predictive dynamics must be underlying .",
    "we think it is interesting to explore particular structures giving rise to this very special set of models in a natural way . in this case",
    "we have a maximum of `` order '' implying special values for all mixing angles : at the other extreme , anarchical models have been proposed @xcite , where no structure at all is assumed in the lepton sector , so that , for example , @xmath14 and @xmath0 are predicted to be in no way special , except that there must be a smallest angle ( probably near to the present bound ) and a largest angle ( expected sizably different from maximal ) .",
    "interesting ideas on how to obtain the hps mixing matrix have been discussed in refs @xcite .",
    "the most attractive models are based on the discrete symmetry @xmath3 , which appears as particularly suitable for the purpose , and were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we start by discussing some general features of hps models .",
    "we then present a new version of an @xmath3 model , with ( moderate ) normal hierarchy , and discuss in detail all aspects of naturalness in this model , also considering effects beyond tree level and the problem of vacuum alignment .",
    "there are a number of substantial improvements in our version with respect to ma in ref .",
    "first , the hps matrix is exactly obtained in a first approximation when higher dimensional operators are neglected , without imposing ad hoc relations among parameters ( in ref .",
    "the equality of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is not guaranteed by the symmetry ) .",
    "the observed hierarchy of charged lepton masses is obtained by assuming a larger flavour symmetry .",
    "the crucial issue of the required vev alignment in the scalar sector is considered with special attention and we present a natural solution of this problem .",
    "we also keep the flavour scalar fields distinct from the normal higgs bosons ( a proliferation of higgs doublets is disfavoured by coupling unification ) and singlets under the standard model gauge group .",
    "last not least , we study the corrections from higher dimensionality operators allowed by the symmetries of the model and discuss the conditions on the cut - off scales and the vevs in order for these corrections to be completely under control .",
    "if the atmospheric mixing angle is really maximal as in the hps ansatz or close to maximal , it seems quite natural to interpret this as the effect of a flavour symmetry .",
    "it would be tempting to think of an approximate flavour symmetry such that @xmath52 arises in the limit of exact symmetry , that is by neglecting all symmetry breaking effects . here",
    "we will show that this is not the case and that , under quite general conditions , we can never obtain @xmath52 as a result of an _ exact _ flavour symmetry .",
    "we assume that this symmetry is a meaningful symmetry , that is it is only broken by small effects , in the real world .",
    "in other words here we exclude symmetries that need breaking terms of order one to describe the observed fermion masses and mixing angles . apart from",
    "that the symmetry can be of whatever type , global or local , continuous or discrete .",
    "being interested in the limit of exact symmetry , we can neglect the sector giving rise to flavour symmetry breaking .",
    "we assume that the fields on which such symmetry acts are the fields of the standard model , plus possibly the right - handed neutrinos , so that our results will also cover the see - saw case .",
    "last , we assume canonical kinetic terms , so that the symmetry acts on the fields of the standard model through unitary transformations .    since the flavour symmetry is broken only by small effects , the mass matrices for charged leptons and neutrinos can be written as : m_e = m_e^0 + ...  ,  m_=m_^0 + ... where dots denote symmetry breaking effects and @xmath53 has rank less or equal than one .",
    "rank greater than one , as for instance when both the tau and the muon have non - vanishing masses in the symmetry limit , is clearly an unacceptable starting point , since the difference between the two non - vanishing masses can only be explained by large breaking effects , which we have excluded , or by a fine - tuning , which we wish to avoid . if the rank of @xmath54 vanishes , than all mixing angles in the charged lepton sector are undetermined in the symmetry limit and @xmath0 is also completely undetermined .",
    "therefore we can focus on the case when @xmath53 has rank one .",
    "if @xmath53 has rank one , then by a unitary transformations we can always go to a field basis where m_e^0= (    ccc 0&0&00&0&00&0&m_^0    )  . as in the original basis , the action of the flavour symmetry on the new field basis is perfectly defined . if @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the unitary matrices that diagonalize @xmath57 and @xmath58 , it will be possible to adopt the parametrization @xcite u_=k_r_23(^_23)p^r_13(^_13)p r_12(^_12 )  , where @xmath59 is the orthogonal matrix representing a rotation in the @xmath60 sector , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "moreover : u_e = r_12(^e_12 )   where the angle @xmath63 is completely undetermined .",
    "the physical mixing matrix is @xmath64 and we find : _",
    "23=^e_12 ^_23 e^i_2 + ^e_12 e^i(+_1 )  .",
    "[ tan23 ] therefore , in general , the atmospheric mixing angle is always undetermined at the leading order .",
    "when small symmetry breaking terms are added to @xmath53 and @xmath57 , it is possible to obtain @xmath52 , provided these breaking terms have suitable orientations in the flavour space . if the breaking terms are produced by a spontaneous symmetry breaking through the minimization of the potential energy of the theory , in general two independent scalar sectors are needed .",
    "one of them communicates the breaking to charged fermions and the other one feeds the breaking to neutrinos .",
    "in such a framework a maximal atmospheric mixing angle is always the result of a special vacuum alignment .    in the literature",
    "there are symmetries predicting @xmath0 large , not necessarily maximal , in the limit of exact symmetry @xcite .",
    "for instance , this is produced by u(1 ) flavour symmetries , when the u(1 ) charges of left - handed leptons and right - handed charged leptons are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 all non - vanishing and different . in the symmetry limit , such an assignment implies ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) : m_e^0 m_e^0= (    ccc 0&0&00&||^2&0&&||^2    )  , and : m_^0 m_^0= (    ccc 0&0&00&||^2+||^2&+0&+&||^2+||^2    )  , with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 independent parameters of the same order of magnitude . if there is no conspiracy among these parameters , the resulting @xmath0 mixing is generically large .    in conclusion ,",
    "a large lepton mixing in the 23 sector is possible as the result of an exact flavour symmetry .",
    "but if we want to reproduce @xmath52 in some limit of our theory , necessarily this limit can not correspond to an exact symmetry in flavour space .",
    "a maximal atmospheric mixing angle can only originate from breaking effects as a solution of a vacuum alignment problem .",
    "our model is based on the discrete group @xmath3 following refs @xcite , where its structure and representations are described in detail .",
    "here we simply recall that @xmath3 is the discrete symmetry group of the rotations that leave a tethraedron invariant , or the group of the even permutations of 4 objects .",
    "it has 12 elements and 4 inequivalent irreducible representations denoted 1 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and 3 in terms of their respective dimensions . introducing @xmath78 , the cubic root of unity , @xmath79 , so that @xmath80 , the three one - dimensional representations are obtained by dividing the 12 elements of @xmath3 in three classes , which are determined by the multiplication rule , and assigning to ( class 1 , class 2 , class 3 ) a factor @xmath81 for 1 , or @xmath82 for @xmath76 or @xmath83 for @xmath77 .",
    "the product of two 3 gives @xmath84 .",

    "@xcite we assigns leptons to the four inequivalent representations of @xmath3 : left - handed lepton doublets @xmath95 transform as a triplet @xmath96 , while the right - handed charged leptons @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 transform as @xmath100 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the flavour symmetry is broken by two real triplets @xmath101 and @xmath102 and by a real singlet @xmath103 . at variance with the choice made by @xcite ,",
    "these fields are gauge singlets .",
    "hence we only need two higgs doublets @xmath104 ( not three generations of them as in ref .",

    "<S> we discuss a particularly symmetric model of neutrino mixings where , with good accuracy , the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath0 is maximal , @xmath1 and the solar angle satisfies @xmath2 ( harrison - perkins - scott ( hps ) matrix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete symmetry @xmath3 is a suitable symmetry group for the realization of this type of model . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a model where the hps matrix is exactly obtained in a first approximation without imposing ad hoc relations among parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial issue of the required vev alignment in the scalar sector is discussed and we present a natural solution of this problem based on a formulation with extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we study the corrections from higher dimensionality operators allowed by the symmetries of the model and discuss the conditions on the cut - off scales and the vevs in order for these corrections to be completely under control . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the observed hierarchy of charged lepton masses is obtained by assuming a larger flavour symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that , under general conditions , a maximal @xmath0 can never arise from an exact flavour symmetry .    0.5 cm    * tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing from discrete symmetry in extra dimensions *    0.2 cm 0.5 cm    guido altarelli   + .1 cm cern , department of physics , theory division + ch-1211 geneva 23 , switzerland + .1 cm and + dipartimento di fisica ` e.  amaldi ' , universit di roma tre + infn , sezione di roma tre , i-00146 rome , italy + .2 cm ferruccio feruglio   + .1 cm dipartimento di fisica ` g.  galilei ' , universit di padova + infn , sezione di padova , via marzolo  8 , i-35131 padua , italy +    0.7 cm    2truecm </S>"
