    "even though more than 60 years have passed since the theoretical prediction of black holes as an astrophysical objects @xcite in some sense they have not been discovered yet .",
    "the features of the black hole ",
    "the compactness ( the size for the mass @xmath1 is close to the schwarzschild one @xmath2 and the mass larger than 3@xmath3  are the necessary , but not the sufficient ones .",
    "the deciding property of the black hole is the presence of the event horizon , instead of with the usual surface . to decide whether it is present in a given compact and massive object it is necessary to detect and study the emission generated very near the event horizon .",
    "it is a very complicated task that can not be easily performed in x - ray binaries and agns due to high accretion rate and so the high optical depth of the accreting gas . at the same time , single stellar - mass black holes , which accrete interstellar medium of low density ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) , are the ideal case for detection and study of the event horizon @xcite .",
    "the analysis of existing data on possible black hole masses and velocities in comparison with the interstellar medium structure shows that in the majority of cases in the galaxy ( @xmath6 ) the accretion rate @xmath7 ca nt exceed @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "black holes usually move supersonically ( at mach numbers 2 - 3 ) .",
    "and only in cold clouds of the interstellar hydrogen ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and at low velocities of motion ( @xmath11 km / s ) the accretion rates may be high and black hole luminosities may reach @xmath12 erg / c . for typical interstellar medium inhomogeneity",
    "the captured specific angular momentum is smaller than that on the bh last stable orbit , and the accretion is always ( with the exception of the case of a black hole in a dense molecular cloud ) spherically - symmetric @xcite .",
    "the accreting plasma is initially collisionless , and it remains so until the event horizon .",
    "the electron - electron and electron - ion free path @xmath13 even at the capture radius is as high as @xmath14 cm .",
    "only the magnetic fields trapped in plasma ( the proton larmor radius at @xmath15 is 10 cm ) make it possible to consider the problem as a quasi - hydrodynamical one ; it is only due to the magnetic field that the particle s momentum is not conserved , allowing particles to fall towards the black hole .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field effectively `` traps '' particles in a `` box '' of variable size , which allows us to consider its adiabatic heating during the fall ; a correct treatment of such a process shows that for magnetized plasma such heating is 25% more effective than for ideal gas due to the conservation of magnetic adiabatic invariant @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the tangential component of electron momentum@xcite .",
    "therefore , the plasma temperature in the accretion flow grows much faster and electrons become relativistic earlier  @xmath18 in contrast to @xmath19 in @xcite and @xmath20 in @xcite .",
    "the accretion flow is much hotter , and our estimation of `` thermal '' luminosity @xmath21 is significantly higher than those of @xcite @xmath22 and @xcite @xmath23 while the optical spectral shape is nearly the same .",
    "the efficiency of accretion as a function of accretion rate is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_efficiency ] .",
    "the basis of our analysis is the assumption of the energy equipartition in the accretion flow ( shvartsman theorem , see @xcite ) .",
    "the straight consequence of this assumption is the necessity of exceeding magnetic energy dissipation with the rate @xmath24    in the previous accretion models the dissipation goes continuously@xcite in the turbulent flow and its mechanism is not examined in details .",
    "we considered conversion of the magnetic energy in the discrete turbulent current sheets @xcite as a mechanism providing such dissipation . at the same time , various modes of plasma oscillations are generated ( ion - acoustic and lengmur plasmons mostly ) , magnetic field lines reconnect and are ejected with plasma from the current sheet and electrons are accelerated .",
    "the latter effect is very important for the observational appearances of the whole accretion flow .",
    "the beams of the accelerated electrons emit its energy due to motion in the magnetic field and generate an additional ( in respect to synchrotron emission of thermal particles ) nonthermal component .",
    "current sheet spatial scales are usually much smaller than the whole accretion flow one and , therefore , the fraction of the accelerated particles is small , and so the total ( significantly nonthermal ) electron distribution @xmath25 may be considered as a superposition of the purely thermal one @xmath26 for the background flow particles and purely nonthermal @xmath27 for the ones accelerated in the current sheets ( this is the approach known as `` hybrid plasma '' , see @xcite ) .",
    "also we assume that for low accretion rates the non - adiabatic heating and radiative energy losses do not change the shape of the thermal component distribution ( while changing its mean energy ) , then @xmath28 note that this distribution is not normalized , and only its shape has physical meaning .",
    "so , for example , the ratio of nonthermal to thermal electron densities at some radius @xmath29 may be expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are integrals of the corresponding distribution functions over the range of @xmath33 .",
    "thermal particle distribution function may be written as @xmath34 where the usual dimensionless expression for temperature @xmath35 is used .",
    "this gives a maxwellian local energy distribution and radial density slope @xmath36 .",
    "to get the temperature profile of the accretion flow let s take into account that the fraction @xmath37 of the magnetic field energy during its dissipation is converted to the energy of the accelerated particles . then , according to ( [ eq_dissipation ] ) , the non - adiabatic heating rate may be expressed as @xmath38    the main mechanism of radiative losses at low accretion rates is synchrotron radiation .",
    "its rate may be written as @xcite @xmath39    for a maxwellian distribution @xmath40    for relatively large accretion rates ( @xmath41 ) it is necessary to take into account the cooling due to inverse compton effect , which converts the part of hot electrons energy to the hard emission .",
    "the rate of inverse compton energy losses is related to the synchrotron one as @xcite @xmath42    taking into account non - adiabatic terms , the energy balance equation per particle may be written for a non - relativistic region of the flow ( @xmath43 ) as @xmath44    for a non - relativistic electron gas @xmath45 , so @xmath46 while for the relativistic one ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( the equipartition condition ) .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath50 .",
    "an analytical solution of this equation in general is very difficult , but for low accretion rates we may neglect the influence of radiative losses and get a solution in the form @xmath51 this expression may be substituted into ( [ eqn_distribution_thermal ] ) to get the final expression for the thermal electron distribution .",
    "the energy evolution of single nonthermal electron is described by @xmath52 where the first term corresponds to synchrotron losses and the second one to adiabatic heating .",
    "analysis of the evolution of electron beams ejected from the current sheets @xcite gives the possibility to compute the @xmath53 and @xmath27 , i.e. the fraction of thermal and nonthermal component contributions to the total one .",
    "the spectra of various components of the accretion flow emission have been computed taking into account relativistic effects of emission propagation near the black hole @xcite .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_spectra ] for various accretion rates . in fig .",
    "[ fig_luminosity_radial ] the integral dependence of the thermal emission of accretion flow on the distance to the black hole is presented .",
    "the large fraction of it is generated inside the 2@xmath15 sphere , and so carries the information very near the event horizon .",
    "an important property of the nonthermal emission is its flaring nature ",
    "the electron ejection process is discrete , and typical light curve of single beam is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_flare_structure ] .",
    "the light curve of each such flare has a stage of fast intensity increase and sharp cut - off , its shape reflects the properties of the magnetic field and space - time near the horizon .    the black hole at a 100 pc distance ( a sphere with this radius must contain several tens of such objects , see @xcite ) looks like a 15 - 25@xmath54 optical object ( due to the `` thermal '' spectral component ) with a strongly variable companion in high - energy spectral bands ( `` nonthermal '' component ) .",
    "the hard emission consists of flares , the majority of which are generated inside a 5@xmath15 distance from the bh .",
    "these events have the durations @xmath55 ( @xmath56 10@xmath57 s ) , a rate of 10@xmath58 - 10@xmath59 flares per second , and an amplitude of 2%-6% . the bh variable x - ray emission may be detected by modern space - borne telescopes .",
    "optical emission consists of both a quasistationary `` thermal '' part and a low - frequency tail of nonthermal flaring emission .",
    "the rate and duration of optical flares are the same as x - ray ones , while their amplitudes are significantly smaller . indeed ,",
    "the contribution of nonthermal component to the optical emission is approximately @xmath60 for @xmath61 , so the mean amplitudes of optical flares are 0.04%-0.12% , while the peak ones may be 1.5 - 2 times higher and reach 0.2% . certainly , it is nearly impossible to detect such single flares , but their collective power reaches 18 - 24@xmath62 and thus may be detected in observations with high time resolution ( @xmath63 10@xmath57 s ) by the large optical telescopes@xcite .    of course , the variability of the bh emission is related not only to the electron acceleration processes described here .",
    "additional variability may be result of the plasma oscillations of different kinds , or other types of instabilities .",
    "the time scale of such variability may be from @xmath64 till @xmath65 , i.e. from microseconds till years .",
    "as it has been already noted , the main indirect observational sign of the isolated stellar mass black hole is the absence of any spectral features in the emission of accreting plasma ( except for interstellar absorption ones ) @xcite . among such objects",
    "are the white dwarfs with featureless spectra ( dc - dwarfs ) and known localization ( as they are usually selected as an objects with known proper motions ) @xcite . on the other hand , in the last years by means of the cross - correlation of surveys of various wave bands ( from radio to gamma ) and the follow - up spectroscopic observations ,",
    "the population of objects with featureless optical spectra and without known localizations , has been detected @xcite .",
    "the latter include the radio objects with continuous optical spectra ( rocoses ) @xcite . for them , as well as for some dc - dwarfs @xcite , the upper limits on the fast optical variability as an observational manifestation of isolated stellar mass black holes",
    "have been derived for the first time @xcite .",
    "this idea became the basis of the observational programme for search for bh on russian 6-m telescope - mania ( multichannel analysis of nanosecond intensity alterations ) @xcite .",
    "recently , some evidences appeared that the isolated stellar mass black holes may be among the unidentified gamma - ray sources @xcite .",
    "the most promising cases are such where the independent estimation of the object mass is possible .",
    "one of such cases is the black hole in a binary system with a white dwarf .",
    "such a binary may be detected by means of its periodic brightness amplification on the tens of seconds time scale due to gravitational microlensing @xcite . by using the technical equipment of sdss ( 23@xmath54 limit in 6 square degree field )",
    "roughly 15 such objects may be detected in 5 years .",
    "it is clear that in such system it is easy to estimate the mass of the black hole , while there is no accretion from the white dwarf onto it , and the black hole interacts with the interstellar medium only .",
    "another case when we may estimate the mass of the black hole are the long macho microlensing events @xcite .    below we present the results of observations of two candidates to the isolated stellar mass black holes .",
    "sample observations of the longest microlensing event macho 1999-blg-22@xcite , a most solid single stellar - mass black hole candidate , have been performed at the special astrophysical observatory of ras in 2003 - 2006 in the framework of the mania experiment@xcite .",
    "we used in observations the multichannel panoramic spectro - polarimeter ( mpsp ) based on position - sensitive detector ( psd ) with 1 @xmath66s time resolution @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mpsp ] ) .",
    "such detectors use the set of multichannel plates ( mcp ) for electron multiplication , and multi - electrode collector to determine its position .",
    "psd used in our observations has the following parameters : quantum efficiency of 10% in the 3700 - 7500 a range , ( s20 photocathode ) , mcp stack gain of @xmath67 , spatial resolution of 70 @xmath66 m ( @xmath68 for the 6-m telescope ) , 700 ns time resolution , @xmath69 pixels with 22 mm working diameter , and the 200 - 500 counts / s detector noise .",
    "the acquisition system used is the `` quantochron 4 - 480 '' spectal time - code convertor with 30 ns time resolution and @xmath67 counts / s maximal count rate .",
    "we combined our data with the archival observations of this region with xmm - newton and hubble acs .",
    "we acquired the upper limits on the black hole x - ray emission on the level of @xmath70 erg / s/@xmath71 .",
    "the hubble acs optical data allow to de - blend the original source detected by @xcite on the level of @xmath72 .",
    "we performed the @xmath73-band photometry of the three stars of the blend and placed an upper limits of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 on the @xmath73-band emission of the bh for the three possible cases .",
    "the parameters derived from the microlensing light curve do nt allow to get the unique value for the distance ( and so , the mass ) to the black hole .",
    "instead , it points to the two possible configurations of the microlensing system , one with the lens at 500 pc ( with @xmath77 ) and the second with 2 kpc distance ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we also studied the intermediate case ( 2 kpc distance , @xmath79 ) .",
    "the predicted observational parameters for these cases , computed according to our model , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_macho_limits ] , with the observational limits overplotted .",
    "our results rule out the case of the near and massive black hole .",
    "the analysis of data from 6-m telescope do not reveal any variable source .",
    "the upper limit on the variable emission component is placed on the @xmath80 level for the @xmath81 - 100 s time scale .",
    "the j1942 + 10 is the radio - loud x - ray object with featureless optical spectrum with @xmath82 .",
