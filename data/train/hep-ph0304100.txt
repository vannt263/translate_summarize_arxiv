    "the rare b - meson decays induced by the flavor  changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) have always been important channels for obtaining information about the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) , testing its predictions at loop level and probing possible new physics .",
    "the observation of radiative penguin mediated processes , in both the exclusive @xmath1@xcite and inclusive @xmath2 @xcite channels have prompted the investigation of the radiative rare b meson decays with a new momentum . among these ,",
    "the semileptonic @xmath3 @xmath4 decays have received a special interest due to their relative cleanliness and sensitivity to new physics as well as ongoing experiments at the two b - factories @xcite .",
    "it is well known that corresponding pure leptonic processes @xmath5 have helicity suppression so that their decay width are too small to be measured for the light lepton modes . in sm",
    "the branching ratio of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "although @xmath8 channel is free from this suppression , its experimental detection is quite hard due to the low efficiency . in @xmath9 decay ,",
    "helicity suppression is overcome by the photon emission in addition to the lepton pair .",
    "therefore , it is expected for @xmath10 decay to have a larger branching ratio and this makes its investigation interesting .",
    "indeed , @xmath10 decays have been widely investigated in the framework of the sm for light and heavy lepton modes @xcite-@xcite , and reported @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the new physics effects in these decays have also been studied in some models , like mssm @xcite-@xcite and the two higgs doublet model @xcite-@xcite , and shown that different observables , like branching ratio , forward - backward asymmetry , etc .",
    ", are very sensitive to the physics beyond the sm .",
    "investigation of the polarization effects may provide another efficient way in establishing the new physics . along this line ,",
    "the polarization asymmetries of the final state lepton in @xmath10 decays have been studied in mssm in @xcite and concluded that they can be very useful for accurate determination of various wilson coefficients .    in a radiative decay mode like ours ,",
    "the final state photon can also emerge with a definite polarization and provide another kinematical variable to study the new physics effects @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will study the rare @xmath14 decay by taking into account the photon polarization .",
    "although experimental measurement of this variable would be much more difficult than that of e.g. , polarization of the final leptons in @xmath15 decay , this is still another kinematical variable for studying radiative decays . in our work",
    "we will investigate sensitivity of such `` photon polarization asymmetry '' in @xmath16 decay to the new wilson coefficients , in addition to the study of total and differential branching ratios with polarized final state photon . doing this we use a most general model independent effective hamiltonian , which contains the scalar and tensor type interactions as well as the vector types ( see eq.([effh ] ) below ) .",
    "we note that in a recent work @xcite we have studied a related mode @xmath17 with a polarized photon in a similar way and showed that the spectrum is sensitive to the types of the interactions so that it is useful to discriminate the various new physics effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the most general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian and the parametrization of the hadronic matrix elements in terms of appropriate form factors .",
    "we then calculate the differential decay width and the photon polarization asymmetry for the @xmath18 decay when the photon is in positive and negative helicity states .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis and discussion of our results .",
    "the matrix element for the process @xmath20 can be obtained from that of the purely leptonic @xmath21 decay .",
    "therefore , we start with the effective hamiltonian for @xmath22 transition written in terms of twelve model independent four - fermi interactions as follows @xcite : [ effh ] h_eff & = & v_tsv_tb^\\ { c_sl |s i _ l b |^+ c_br |s i _ r b |^ + & & + c_ll^tot |s_l _ b_l |_l ^_l + c_lr^tot |s_l _ b_l |_r ^_r + c_rl |s_r _ b_r |_l ^_l + & & + c_rr |s_r _ b_r |_r ^_r + c_lrlr |s_l b_r |_l",

    "we note that several of the wilson coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ effh ] ) do already exist in the sm : in the sm , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are in the form @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the @xmath34 decay , while the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 correspond to @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "therefore , writing c_ll^tot & = & c_9^eff - c_10 + c_ll  , + c_lr^tot & = & c_9^eff+c_10 + c_lr  , we see that @xmath39 and @xmath40 contain the contributions from the sm and also from the new physics .",
    "having established the general form of the effective hamiltonian , we proceed to calculate the matrix element of the @xmath20 decay .",
    "this exclusive decay can receive short - distance contributions from the box , z , and photon penguin diagrams for @xmath41 transition by attaching an additional photon line to any internal or external lines .",
    "as pointed out before @xcite , contributions coming from the release of the free photon from any charged internal line will be suppressed by a factor of @xmath42 and we neglect them in the following analysis . when a photon is released from the initial quark lines it contributes to the so - called `` structure dependent '' ( sd ) part of the amplitude , @xmath43 .",

    "<S> using the most general model independent form of the effective hamiltonian , the rare @xmath0 decays are studied by taking into account the polarization of the photon . </S>",

    "<S> it is also investigated the sensitivity of `` photon polarization asymmetry '' in @xmath0 decays to the new wilson coefficients . </S>",
