    "[ fig : vacua ] are degenerate and different vacua have the same energy .",
    "if they have strings ( intersection of domain walls ) , they must be taken into account in the energy calculation inside the blackhole , not considering the outside part .",

    "if the tail is cut , the outside observer notices that the blackhole ate only even number of @xmath9 charge with some energy increase inside the blackhole but the discrete charge is not increased in the blackhole .",
