    "studying quantum hydrodynamics in an atomic bec subject to an oscillating potential should open up a research area different from helium and other bec cases for the following reasons .",
    "first , since an atomic bec is a clean system free of remnant defects and impurities , it is possible to study the intrinsic nucleation of topological defects .",
    "second , the oscillating potential leads to synergy dynamics of quantized vortices and solitons that have not been previously observed .",
    "linear motion of the potential results in vortex dipoles with _ fixed _",

    "thus the vortices nucleated by the potential enjoy a lengthly migration in the `` sea '' of bec ; the vortices are nucleated from the potential , reconnect , move away from it , reach the surface , head toward the bow and come back to the center . in the following , we illustrate elementary processes related to the synergy dynamics .",

    "a key issue is to understand how quantized vortices are nucleated . for a condensate to have vortices",
    ", it should bring some seeds of the topological defects from somewhere .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the formation of a vortex lattice in a rotating bec @xcite .",
    "rotation nucleates `` ghost vortices '' in the low - density region at the outskirts of the condensate , and they are dragged into the interior to become the usual vortices having the condensate density .",
    "our condensate has to do a similar thing .",
    "ghost vortices can appear in two low - density regions in our system ; one is inside the oscillating potential and the other is at the outskirts of the condensate .",
    "as soon as the potential starts to oscillate , a pair of ghost vortices is nucleated inside the potential and the condensate surface is filled with them .",

    "after a vortex pair is nucleated behind the potential , it has an impulse in the direction of the velocity of the potential .",
    "hence the pair follows the potential in fig.3(a ) .",
    "thereafter the oscillating potential changes the direction of its velocity in fig.3(b ) and it makes a new ghost vortex pair whose direction of impulse is opposite to that of the old pair .",
    "then the ghost pair gets away from the potential , becoming a new vortex pair .",
    "the pair immediately reconnects with the old pair in fig.3(c ) .",
    "this process produces new vortex pairs leaving the potential , and the pairs go toward the surface of the condensate in fig.3(d ) .",
    "the vortex pair escaping from the potential in fig.3(d ) reaches the surface and interacts with many fluctuating ghost vortices there .",
    "the pair divorces , and the two resulting vortices move in opposite directions along the surface .",
    "the motion is caused by the following mechanism .",
    "the normal component of the velocity field at the surface is suppressed when vortices are close to the surface .",
    "this makes the velocity field parallel to the surface , which moves the vortices along the surface .",
    "this motion may be understood shortly by using the idea of image vortices @xcite , though the idea assumes that the boundary is a solid wall and this is not exactly the case .",
    "the most interesting phenomenon in our research is the synergy dynamics between solitons and vortices .",
    "nucleation , collision , and collapse of solitons are observed .",
    "these occur after fig.1(e ) .",
    "a soliton can be identified by its low density and phase jump of about @xmath34 .",
    "figure4(a ) through ( h ) show the nucleation of a soliton , which is peculiar to the dynamics by an oscillating potential . after the process in fig.3(a ) to ( d ) occurs twice in both the right and left regions , the configuration of fig.4(a ) is obtained .",
    "the vortex pairs in the right region in fig.4(a ) get near the surface , and reconnect with other vortices in fig.4(b ) . the vortex pairs are depicted by closed loops with dashed lines . the pairs head toward the center of the condensate in fig.4(c ) .",
    "subsequently , annihilation of a pair occurs as it reaches the center , becoming a soliton in fig.4(d ) . the change from a vortex dipole to a soliton",
    "is related to the nucleation of rarefaction pulse @xcite .",
    "one may think that the edges of the solitons have quantized vortices so that the low density regions inside the closed loops in fig.4(d ) are merely vortex dipoles .",
    "however , there is a clear distinction between a vortex dipole and a soliton , which is obviously seen in the phase profiles ( fig.4(e ) , ( h ) ) corresponding to fig.4(c ) and ( d ) .",
    "figure4(e ) and ( f ) show the phase profiles before and after the annihilation of the dipoles .",
    "their enlarged phase profiles are fig.4(g ) and ( h ) , which show respectively the vortex dipole and the soliton .",
    "figure 4(g ) shows apparently that the dipole has the topological defects in the phase profile , while the soliton in fig.4(h ) does not have such defects and the velocity field around the edges does not have quantized circulation as seen by the arrows referring to superflow .",
    "there remains the velocity field related to quantized vortices outside the edges , whereas the velocity field which tends to cancel the outside flow are induced in the low density region between the edges .",
    "thus we can identify the soliton by checking the density and phase profile .",
    "the collapse of the solitons nucleates vortex pairs in ( a ) to ( d ) of fig.5 .",
    "the solitons in fig.4(d ) have opposite impulse , so that they collide with each other .",
    "however , they pass through each other without changing shape , in accord with the nature of solitons .",
    "the solitons then move toward the surface in fig.5(a ) .",
    "a two - dimensional soliton is unstable , and collapse of the solitons occurs at the surface . as a result , a soliton decays into a vortex pair at the surface , as shown in fig.5(b ) .",
    "these vortex pairs are depicted by closed loops with solid lines . immediately after the collapse ,",
    "the vortex pairs interact with ghost vortices in fig.5(c ) . then , the vortices move toward the bow of the condensate along the surface in fig.5(d ) because of the mechanism described in iv.c .",
    "this process repeats as long as the gaussian potential oscillates .",
    "this sort of transformation between vortex dipoles and solitons has been reported by huang _",
    "it is possible to heat a condensate by an oscillating potential .",
    "we numerically calculate the increase in the total energy , estimating the temperature change by using the specific heat of the equilibrium state of the system .",
    "the change is found to be only @xmath50nk even by the time of the last image in fig.1 .",
    "hence the heating is negligible , and use of the gp model is valid .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations of the two - dimensional gp equation to investigate the dynamics of vortices and solitons in a trapped bec induced by an oscillating potential .",
    "this paper reveals the dynamics characterized by oscillation .",
    "it is essential that the oscillating potential makes vortex dipoles with different charges , which results in the synergy dynamics between vortices and solitons .",
    "the parameters used in these calculations are appropriate to experiments on atomic becs .",
    "we confirm the dynamics not only for the single fixed geometry but also for similar sets of parameters and geometry .",
    "hence , the dynamics obtained in our study should be experimentally observable",
    ". however , the dynamics by the oscillating potential should be dependent on the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "preliminary calculations indicate that a potential with lower amplitude creates more solitons , in contrast to the present result .",
    "in addition , the aspect ratio of the condensate shape should affect the dynamics .",
