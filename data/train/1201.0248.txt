    "entangled states of higher - dimensional systems are of great interest owing to the extended possibilities they provide , which including higher information density coding @xcite , stronger violations of local realism @xcite , and more resilience to error @xcite than two dimensional system . over the past few years , fairish attention has been paid to implement higher - dimensional entanglement with trapped ions @xcite , photons @xcite , and cavity qed @xcite .",

    "recently , remote entanglement between a single atom and a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) was experimentally realized @xcite . but the efficiency is very low due to the photon loss . in this paper , we takes both the advantages of cavity qed and stirap in order to create three - dimensional entanglement state between a single @xmath0 atom and a @xmath0  bec at a distance .",
