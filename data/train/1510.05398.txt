    "the hubbard model is a paradigmatic model system for the description of correlated electrons in solids . despite the simplicity of the model ,",
    "an exact solution is only available in one spatial dimension .",
    "the two - dimensional model is believed to contain the essential ingredients to describe high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "similar to these materials , the model shows antiferromagnetism in its ground state at half - filling and becomes superconducting when sufficiently doped away from half - filling  @xcite .",
    "the lightly doped regime of cuprate materials and the hubbard model are , however , relatively poorly understood . achieving an accurate description of the properties of the hubbard model in this regime",
    "is therefore highly desirable .",
    "recent progress in the development of some numerical methods allowed to achieve agreement between the results in certain parameter regimes , but discrepancies remain for the important intermediate coupling regime at small doping  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "several different states have very similar energies and an accurate determination of the ground state is difficult .",
    "one source of difficulty is the limitation of many numerical methods to relatively small systems .",
    "it therefore seems useful to complement numerical studies of the model with more analytical approaches that have access to low - energy fermi surface instabilities in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one such method is the functional renormalization group  @xcite ( frg ) .",
    "this method treats all interaction channels on equal footing and is thus well suited for the study of competing order .",
    "one of its major successes was the unbiased detection of @xmath2-wave superconductivity in the ground state of the two - dimensional hubbard model at weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "results at weak coupling can not be directly transferred to the cuprates , but allow to understand some qualitative features of their phase diagram in a controlled way . until recently , the applicability of available truncation schemes of the frg flow equations was limited to weak coupling , but this restriction may be removed by using non - trivial starting points for the frg flow  @xcite .",
    "most frg studies for itinerant fermionic systems used a one - loop truncation , in which the fermionic self - energy and the two - particle vertex are renormalized  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the fact that the information on most continuous phase transitions is encoded in the momentum dependence of the vertex , which diverges with the correlation length for certain combinations of momenta , the self - energy was usually neglected .",
    "a few studies investigated the influence of the self - energy on the flow and focused on the parameter region around van hove filling .",
    "a general tendency towards a flattening of the fermi surface was found in an early study slightly above van hove filling , which however neglected the feedback of the self - energy on the flow  @xcite .",
    "more recent studies included the self - energy feedback on the flow , but were mostly restricted to a small region around van hove filling , where interesting effects like competing instabilities or non - fermi liquid behavior may already occur at weak coupling  @xcite . in this parameter regime , it was found that renormalizing the fermi surface has only a very small impact on the flow .",
    "despite the fact that deformations of the fermi surface are important perturbations in two - dimensional systems , their impact on functional renormalization group flows away from van hove filling has not been fully addressed , yet . knowing the impact of the self - energy on frg flows in a broader parameter regime is certainly useful to judge the reliability of flows with perturbative as well as non - trivial starting points .",
    "moreover , the one - loop frg was also applied to model systems for the description of unconventional superconductivity in pnictide and ruthenate materials  @xcite and used to provide an explanation for subtle features in the momentum dependence of the superconducting gap . as these works neglected the fermionic self - energy",
    ", it would be interesting to know how robust their results are if the self - energy were taken into account .    in this work",

    "flows at van hove filling are not changed qualitatively when the fermi surface is renormalized .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for electron fillings below van hove filling . in the presence of antiferromagnetic hot spots , _",
    "i.e. _  intersection points of the fermi surface and the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone , the renormalization of the fermi surface via the self - energy has a sizable quantitative impact on critical scales and shifts the boundaries between regimes with different leading instabilities .",
    "this is caused by a flattening of the fermi surface , which leads to improved nesting and enhances antiferromagnetic fluctuations , thereby enlarging the parameter regime with antiferromagnetism as leading instability .",
    "combining frg flows with a mean - field ( mf ) analysis  @xcite for the magnetic phase diagram , we trace back the large impact of the self - energy on the flow to the presence of a magnetic first - order phase transition .    this paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec : modelmethod ] briefly introduces the hubbard model and the frg .",

    "antiferromagnetic instabilities appear , which were not present in the static approximation .",
    "the increase of critical scales in comparison to the static approximation seems to be a peculiarity of the chosen regulator and should not be misunderstood in the sense that a frequency dependent vertex and self - energy , and in particular a reduced quasiparticle weight , enhance ordering tendencies .",
    "fluctuation contributions are weighted differently in the static and the dynamic one - loop approximation . which one yields smaller critical scales depends on the regularization scheme .",
    "for a smooth multiplicative frequency regulator  @xcite and a sharp multiplicative momentum cutoff  @xcite , it was found for the repulsive hubbard model at van hove filling that the critical scales were smaller in the dynamic than in the static approximation .",
    "for the attractive hubbard model and the same regulator as employed in this work , the static approximation yielded smaller critical scales and superconducting gaps than the dynamic approximation  @xcite . neglecting the frequency dependence of the self - energy ( and thus the renormalization of the quasiparticle weight via @xmath128 ) , but taking the frequency dependence of the vertex into account , yields a further increase of critical scales for all regulators .",

    "[ fig9 ] , we show the variation of the quasiparticle weight @xmath133 along the fermi surface for @xmath66 , @xmath77 and various fermionic densities . in all cases shown ,",
    "the quasiparticle weight is smallest very close to the antiferromagnetic hot spots . at van hove filling , the minimum is slightly shifted away from the saddle point of the fermionic dispersion because the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are incommensurate at low scales .",

    "being minimal at the hot spots is consistent with the behavior of the spin - fermion model at a spin - density wave quantum critical point with ordering momentum @xmath105",
    "it is interesting that the quasiparticle weight is largest for @xmath135 , although the critical scale is lower and the fermi velocities at the hot spots are slightly more antiparallel than at half - filling .     along the fermi surface at the end of the flow for @xmath66 , @xmath77 and various densities .",

    "the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are commensurate , the maximum is located at the antiferromagnetic hot spots . at van hove filling , the maximum is shifted slightly away from the saddle points due to incommensurate magnetic fluctuations . note that a positive @xmath138 yields a reduction of @xmath137 during the flow",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the impact of self - energy effects on functional renormalization group flows away from van hove filling . for the latter filling , which was mostly studied before , our conclusions agree very well with the literature . in particular , fluctuation induced deformations of the fermi surface have a small impact on the flow .",
    "this changes for higher fillings , where antiferromagnetic hot spots exist . in this regime , mostly antiferromagnetic fluctuations lead to a flattening of the fermi surface , which itself amplifies the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "this effect is well known and here we showed that it significantly enhances ordering tendencies to commensurate antiferromagnetism and leads to higher critical scales .",
    "interestingly , for the parameters considered in this work the maximum of critical scales is always shifted towards half - filling .    using a combination of functional renormalization group and mean - field theory",
    ", we showed that self - energy corrections lead to strong shifts of magnetic phase boundaries and can reduce the first order character of antiferromagnetic phase transitions .",
    "the former is the underlying reason for the enhanced ordering tendencies and critical scales as found in the renormalization group flow .    also considering the frequency dependence of the vertex and the self - energy within a dynamic approximation",
    ", we found a further increase of critical scales and enlargement of the parameter region with antiferromagnetic order .",
    "note that the critical scales are nevertheless significantly smaller than in an rpa - type approximation where fluctuations are neglected .    on the question whether deformations of the fermi surface have a qualitative impact on phase diagrams derived from",
    "one - loop functional renormalization group flows , our results suggest that they are indeed important close to first order phase transitions with finite ordering wave vectors as in the case of antiferromagnetism , or in the presence of hot spots . for lower electron densities below and around van hove filling , they seem to be of minor importance .",
