    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is a unifying theme of modern theoretical physics , with applications ranging from statistical physics @xcite to condensed matter @xcite and particle physics @xcite . because of its fundamental relevance in our understanding of nature",
    ", it is important to study simple systems for which the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking can be rigorously established .",
    "probably the simplest system which displays spontaneous simmetry breaking is the ising model in statistical physics , named after e.  ising , who first solved the unidimensional version of the problem @xcite .",
    "this model is defined on a graph , _",
    "i.e. _ on a set of points ( called sites in the following ) equipped with the notion of nearest neighbourhood . a variable @xmath2 , which takes value in the set @xmath3 , is associated to each site @xmath4 of the graph .",
    "we will call `` configuration '' a given assignment of the variables @xmath5 to the graph sites and the energy of a configuration is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 are constants and",
    "@xmath8 denotes the sum on the first neighbour sites . for the sake of the simplicity in the following we will only consider the model defined on an hypercubic lattice in @xmath1 dimensions , which is the most studied case .    for @xmath9",
    "this model describes an uniaxial ferromagnet in an external magnetic field of intensity @xmath10 .",
    "configurations in which most of the nearest neighbour sites are oriented in the same direction are favoured , since they correspond to lower values of the energy .",
    "moreover configurations with the value @xmath11 in most sites are favoured by the interaction with the external magnetic field .",
    "the model with @xmath12 is particularly interesting since the energy is invariant under the transformation @xmath13 by applying this transformation two times we come back to the original configuration , so the symmetry group of the model for @xmath12 is @xmath14 . in the following of this paper",
    "we will be interested just in this @xmath12 case .",
    "we now introduce the average magnetization per site of a configuration , defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total number of sites and @xmath17 is the number of sites with @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear from this definition that @xmath19 is odd under the transformation in , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath19 goes to @xmath20 .",
    "since the energy of two configurations related by the symmetry in is the same , one could think that the statistical average of @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath21 , identically vanishes .",
    "this is true for finite systems , however , in the thermodynamical limit , if @xmath22 the magnetization @xmath23 vanishes only in the high temperature paramagnetic phase . in the low temperature ferromagnetic phase",
    "the value of @xmath24 is not well defined and depends on how the thermodynamical limit is performed . in this case",
    "the symmetry in is said to be spontaneously broken .",
    "the breaking of a symmetry can be thought as a form of thermodynamical instability : the particular value acquired by @xmath24 in the ferromagnetic phase is determined by small perturbations . a conventional way to uniquely define @xmath24 in the broken phase ( where it is called spontaneous magnetization ) is to use an infinitesimal magnetic field : @xmath25 where it is crucial to perform the thermodynamical limit before switching off the magnetic field .",
    "the instability manifests itself in that using @xmath26 in would change the sign of @xmath24 .",
    "a different approach to expose the instability is the use of appropriate boundary conditions : we can for example impose in all the sites @xmath27 on the lattice boundary the condition @xmath28 . in the paramagnetic phase the effect of the boundary conditions",
    "does not survive the thermodynamical limit , while in the ferromagnetic phase their effect is analogous to that of the infinitesimal magnetic field in .    on a finite lattice the mean value of the magnetization @xmath19 can be written in the form @xmath29 where we used the fact @xmath30 , and in order to show that @xmath31 it is sufficient to show that for every @xmath16 we have @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 and @xmath16-independent ) .",
    "the peierls argument is a simple geometrical construction that can be used to prove this bound .",
    "it was introduced for the first time in @xcite and some errors in the estimates used were later corrected in @xcite .",
    "the original formulation referred to the two dimensional ising model , whose solution @xcite was still not known , but the idea of the argument can be adapted also to the general @xmath1 dimensional problem with @xmath34 , which is still an active field of research ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the outcome of the peierls argument for the model in @xmath1 dimensions is an estimate of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a continuous function of @xmath36 ( independent of @xmath16 ) such that @xmath39 .",
    "in particular for small enough @xmath40 we have the bound @xmath41 ( @xmath33 ) , which ensures that @xmath42 and the @xmath14 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the original @xmath0 argument is described in most books on statistical mechanics ( like _ e.g. _ @xcite ,  14.3 ) , however the construction is presented in such a way that the generalization to higher dimension is not immediate : the use of ordered paths in @xmath0 simplifies the proof of some of the estimates but can not be easily generalized to the higher dimensional setting .",
    "moreover the combinatorics needed for @xmath34 appears at first sight to be much more involved than the one required in the two dimensional case . on the other hand",
    "the higher dimensional problem is discussed in specialized books ( like @xcite ) , but the topic is approached from a different and more abstract point of view , out of reach for most of the students of a first course in statistical mechanics",
    ". the consequence could be the ( erroneous ! ) feeling that the peierls argument can be conveniently applied only in the case in which , strictly speaking , it is no more necessary , being the two - dimensional ising model exactly solvable .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by presenting an elementary discussion of the peierls argument in its more general @xmath1-dimensional version .",
    "first of all we present the peierls argument in @xmath0 using a construction scheme of the domains different from the one typically adopted , which can be easily generalized to the higher dimensional case , then we go on to show how to solve the additional problems that arise in the higher dimensional environment . with this aim",
    "we discuss in some detail the @xmath43 problem , where one still has a good geometrical intuition , and finally analyze the general @xmath1 dimensional case , which is at this point an almost trivial extension of the three dimensional one .",
    "we consider a two dimensional square lattice of size @xmath44 ( with lattice spacing @xmath45 ) and fix @xmath28 on the boundary sites @xmath27 .",
    "the peierls contours are introduced by the following procedure :    1 .",
    "draw a unit square on each site @xmath4 with @xmath46 2 .",
    "cancel the edges that appear twice ( _ i.e. _ that separate two neighbour sites @xmath47 with @xmath48 ) 3",
    ".   in the case in which four edges meet at the same point , chop off the corner of the squares in order to remove ambiguities .",
    "an example of the application of this procedure is shown in and it is immediate to show that the following facts are true :    * every contour is a closed non - intersecting curve * every site @xmath4 with @xmath46 is inside at least one contour * the set of the admissible contours is in a one - to - one correspondence with the set of the configurations .",
    "the one - to - one relation in the last property depends on the fixed @xmath28 boundary conditions : the presence of a contour signals a change of sign of the site variable and the @xmath49 assignment on the boundaries uniquely fix the signs .    in a finite lattice",
    "the number of contours of given length @xmath50 is finite , let us denote this number by @xmath51 .",
    "the generic peierls contour can then be denoted by @xmath52 , where @xmath50 is the length of the contour and @xmath53 . if @xmath54 is the area of the contour @xmath55 ( that is the number of sites inside the contour ) we have the following upper bound for the number @xmath56 of sites with @xmath46 present in a configuration : @xmath57 where @xmath58 if @xmath55 occurs in the given configuration and @xmath59 otherwise .",
    "the lower bound of the sum is @xmath60 since this is the minimal length possible for a closed contour , moreover the length of a closed contour has to be even , hence the sum extends on even numbers only . is a simple consequence of the fact that every site @xmath4 with @xmath46 is inside at least one contour : if we sum the area of all the contours that occur in a configuration we get an upper bound for @xmath56 in that configuration .    the next step is to show that @xmath61 has an upper bound of the form @xmath62 , _",
    "i.e. _ that depend only on the length @xmath50 of the contour .",
    "this upper bound can be obtained in the following way : draw the smallest rectangle @xmath63 ( with sides parallel to the boundaries of the lattice ) that contain @xmath64 ( see for an example ) .",
    "the perimeter of @xmath63 is not larger than @xmath50 : if we draw inside @xmath63 a line parallel to one of the axes , this line intersects @xmath63 in two edges , but this line also has to intersect @xmath64 in at least two edges , otherwise @xmath64 would be separated in two disjoint contours or @xmath63 would not be the smallest rectangle containing @xmath64 . if we denote the length of the sides of @xmath63 by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we thus have @xmath67 and @xmath68 . as a consequence @xmath69",
    "it is simple to show that the maximum in the previous equations is reached when @xmath70 ( _ i.e. _ of all the rectangles of fixed perimeter the square is the one with the largest area ) and we conclude that @xmath71 we can now use to modify as follows : @xmath72    in the following we will not be interested on the value of @xmath56 for a single configuration , but on the mean value @xmath73 . from the previous equation",
    "we get @xmath74 and our next task will be to show that @xmath75 , where the function @xmath76 depends only on the length @xmath50 of the path @xmath64 .    the thermal average @xmath77 is defined by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and the sum is extended over the set @xmath80 of configurations that satisfy the @xmath28 boundary conditions . from the definition of @xmath81 we immediately see that its mean value can be rewritten in the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the set of all the configurations in @xmath80 which contain the peierls contour @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath84 be a configuration in @xmath83 and define the configuration @xmath85 as the one obtained from @xmath84 by changing the sign of all the variables associated to sites inside @xmath64 ( an example of such a transformation is given in ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath86 , since the boundary values of the configuration are unchanged , so the set of all the possible @xmath85 is a subset of the collection @xmath80 : @xmath87 and thus @xmath88 from this relation see that @xmath89 and , noting that if @xmath90 we have @xmath91 we obtain the upper bound @xmath92 by using this bound in we get @xmath93 and to finish we need an upper bound for @xmath51 , _ i.e. _ for the number of closed paths of length @xmath50 .",
    "this can be obtained by enumerating the possible ways in which a closed contour of length @xmath50 can be constructed by using @xmath50 edges .",
    "we have @xmath94 possible choices on where to put the first edge ; we will call this choice step @xmath95 .",
    "since we have to build a closed curve , each of the two ending of the first edge has to be connected to other edges and each new edge can be connected in @xmath96 different ways to the previous one .",
    "we now proceed by iteration : at step @xmath97 we add two new edges to the two open endings of the curve obtained at step @xmath98 . once the edge at step @xmath95",
    "is fixed we have at most @xmath99 way to build up the curve up to step @xmath100 .",
    "the length of the curve at step @xmath100 is @xmath101 and when we arrive to the step @xmath102 defined by @xmath103 ( remember that @xmath50 is even ) we have only one possible way to add the last edge to close the curve , so the number of closed curves of length @xmath50 has to be smaller than @xmath104 .",
    "we now note that the same path can be obtained in a similar way by starting from a different edge in the first step , since all the edges of a closed curve are on the same footing , so we arrive to the upper bound @xmath105 by using this estimate in and remembering the definitions in and we finally get @xmath106 this sum is convergent provided @xmath107 and the sum can be performed analytically ( see appendix [ 2dsum ] ) .",
    "the final result is ( @xmath36 is defined in ) @xmath108 which is a bound of the form .",
    "we now consider a three dimensional square lattice of size @xmath109 with lattice spacing @xmath45 .",
    "the peierls contours of the two dimensional case now become surfaces , but their construction proceed along the same line as in the two dimensional case :    1 .",
    "draw a unit cube on each site @xmath4 such that @xmath46 2 .",
    "cancel the faces that appear twice ( _ i.e. _ that separate two neighbour sites @xmath47 with @xmath48 ) 3",
    ".   if ambiguities are present , chop off the corners of the cubes in order to remove them .",
    "when using the @xmath28 boundary condition we have the following properties    * every peierls surface is a closed non - intersecting surface * every site @xmath4 with @xmath46 is inside at least one surface * the set of the admissible surfaces is in a one - to - one correspondence with the set of the configurations .    which are the natural extension of the properties seen in the two dimensional case .",
    "the bound in becomes now @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the general peierls surface composed by @xmath112 elementary squares , @xmath113 is the volume of @xmath111 ( that is the number of sites it contains ) and @xmath114 is the number of closed surfaces of area @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath115 is defined as in the two dimensional case , the lower extremum of the sum on @xmath112 is @xmath116 since this is the smallest area of a closed surface in @xmath43 and the sum extends on even numbers only since the area of a close surface is always even .    to show that , for sufficiently low temperature , a spontaneous magnetization is present we have to found the three dimensional analogs of the bounds , and .    to find the three dimensional version of the procedure used in the two dimensional case has to be slightly modified",
    "let us consider the smallest rectangular parallelogram @xmath63 that contains the surface @xmath111 .",
    "in the three dimensional space it is not true that the area of @xmath63 is not larger than the area of @xmath111 ( a simple counterexample is a donut shaped surface of sufficiently large radius ) , so we need a different constraint to be imposed on the edges @xmath117 of @xmath63 .",
    "we can for example notice that we must have @xmath118 : by using @xmath112 elementary squares to construct a closed surface , the maximum value we can get for @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 or @xmath119 ) is @xmath120 , which correspond to the surface shown in . thus we get @xmath121 proceeding in this way in the two dimensional case we would have obtained @xmath122 , which is weaker than .",
    "the bound in becomes @xmath123 and the proof is completely analogous to one given for the two dimensional case : the transformation @xmath124 now flip all the variables associated to the sites inside the surface @xmath111 and becomes @xmath125    the last ingredient we need is the bound on @xmath114 .",
    "again we can proceed analogously to the two dimensional case , by enumerating the possible ways in which we can put together @xmath112 elementary squares to obtain a closed surface . in the step number one we have @xmath126 possible choices , and the surface",
    "is then built in the following way : at step @xmath100 we add @xmath127 squares to the surface , in such a way to saturate all the free edges present in the step @xmath98 .    here",
    "a little complication arises : in the planar case at every step we always have to add two more elements to the construction , while in the three dimensional case the number of elementary squares to be added is not constant in @xmath100 , and in fact for some configuration this number is not even uniquely determined ( _ i.e. _ it depends on the way the squares are added ) .",
    "this complication is however not serious : an elementary square can be connected to a free edge in at most @xmath96 different ways , so at step @xmath100 , when @xmath127 squares are added , we have at most @xmath128 possibilities . as a consequence ,",
    "if the construction of the surface is completed in @xmath102 steps , the total number of different possibilities is at most @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , independent of the construction details . as in the two dimensional case , in this reasoning we overestimated the total number of different configurations by a factor @xmath112 , since all the squares of a surface can be used as a starting point its construction .",
    "the final bound is thus : @xmath131    > from we can now obtain an upper bound of the form in : @xmath132 this series is convergent provided @xmath133 and the sum can be performed analytically , see appendix [ 3dsum ] , the final result of the computation being @xmath134",
    "the general case of @xmath1 dimensions , with @xmath136 , does not present additional difficulties with respect to the three dimensional setting studied before .",
    "we just need to substitute `` cube '' with `` hypercube '' , `` face '' with `` hyperface '' and `` edge '' with `` hyperedge '' .",
    "the hyperface and hyperedge terms are not conventional but we will use them in order to make evident the similarity with the three dimensional case .",
    "an hyperface is an elementary @xmath137 surface in the @xmath1 dimensional space , _ i.e. _ an hypercube in @xmath137 dimensions . in an analogous way an hyperedge is an elementary @xmath138 surface in the @xmath1 dimensional environment , _",
    "i.e. _ an hypercube in the @xmath138 dimensional space",
    ".    we will consider an hypercubic lattice of linear size @xmath139 and lattice spacing @xmath45 .",
    "the construction of the peierls domains proceeds along the same way as in @xmath43 and the peierls domanis will now be closed non - intersecting hypersurfaces .",
    "again each site @xmath4 with @xmath46 is inside at least a peierls hypersurface and , when the @xmath28 conditions are imposed on the lattice boundary , the set of the admissible hypersurfaces is in a one - to - one correspondence with the set of the configurations .",
    "the generalization of is @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the hyperarea of the peierls surface @xmath142 .",
    "again @xmath141 has to be even and the smallest possible value for @xmath141 is @xmath143 .    to estimate @xmath144 , as in the @xmath43 setting",
    ", we have to find the `` more elongated '' closed hypersurface composed of @xmath141 hyperfaces .",
    "this is given by the @xmath1 dimensional generalization of , for which : @xmath145 as a consequence the bound in becomes @xmath146    the proof of the bound goes on without significant modifications and the final result is again @xmath147    to get an estimate of @xmath148 we just have to notice that , as in the @xmath43 case , in order to build an hypersurface , an hyperface can be connected to a given hyperedge in no more than @xmath96 ways . as a consequence also this estimate goes along the same lines as the one in @xmath43 , the only difference being that in the first step we now have @xmath149 possibilities instead of @xmath126 , obtaining @xmath150    the final bound on @xmath73 for the @xmath1 dimensional problem is thus @xmath151 which , using the substitution @xmath152 and , becomes @xmath153 for general @xmath1 the sum can not be performed in a closed rational form , but , with the substitution @xmath154 , can be rewritten as @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the lerch transcendent function ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite  1.11 , @xcite ) .",
    "the final result is thus @xmath157 which is of the form since the lerch transcendent is regular for @xmath158 .",
    "we presented an elementary discussion of the peierls argument for the case of the @xmath159dimensional ( @xmath22 ) ising model defined on a cubical lattice .",
    "the outcome of this arguments is an upper bound for @xmath160 ( eqs .",
    "( [ 2d_final ] ) , ( [ 3d_final ] ) and ( [ final ] ) ) , which implies for low enough temperature a non - vanishing lower bound for the spontaneous magnetization and thus the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking .    by looking back at the previous exposition we see that , apart from the numerical details , what makes the argument sound is the fact that the `` entropy '' terms @xmath161 and @xmath162 grow as a finite power of @xmath141 , while the `` energy '' term @xmath163 is exponentially dumped by @xmath141 . as a consequence the series in is convergent and the sum vanishes in the large @xmath164 limit .",
    "the failure of this condition is the reason why the argument can not be applied to the one dimensional ising model : in that case the domains are just segments , @xmath161 and @xmath162 still grow with @xmath141 but now @xmath163 is @xmath165independent ( it is just @xmath166 ) .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath73 is now a series which is divergent in the thermodynamical limit and thus useless .",
    "in fact the one dimensional ising model can be analytically solved and no symmetry breaking is found for any positive value of the temperature ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .    as a last remark we note that from the bound in we can get a bound for the critical coupling @xmath167 , which is defined as the coupling at which the system switches from a ferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic state . from",
    "we see that , as far as @xmath168 , the system has to be ferromagnetic , so the critical value @xmath169 must lie outside the region @xmath170 $ ] , where @xmath171 is defined as the smallest positive solution of the equation @xmath172 from @xmath173 we get @xmath174 , where @xmath175 and some numerical values for @xmath176 as a function of @xmath1 are reported in . for comparison ,",
    "the best available determination of the critical point for the three dimensional ising model is @xmath177 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , from which we see that , for @xmath43 , @xmath176 is of the same order of magnitude of @xmath178 . for larger @xmath1 values",
    "this is however no more true .",
    "the behaviour of the critical temperature of the ising model in the limit of large @xmath1 is quite well known : both lower @xcite and upper @xcite bounds are known for @xmath167 and , by the combination of these bounds , one gets ( @xcite ) @xmath179 and thus @xmath167 goes to zero as @xmath1 grows . on the other hand from we see that @xmath180 converges to a non - vanishing limit as @xmath181 .",
    "this is a well known limitation of the peierls argument ( see the introduction of @xcite for a discussion ) , which has to be modified in a non - elementary way to obtain an upper bound for @xmath182 that vanishes in the large @xmath1 limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank pasquale calabrese , maurizio fagotti and silvia musolino for useful comments and discussions .",
    "by changing variable from @xmath50 to @xmath183 we get @xmath184 we introduce the variable @xmath36 defined in and , by using @xmath185 , we obtain @xmath186 which is the result used in the text .      by changing variable from @xmath112 to @xmath187",
    "we have @xmath188 where in the second line we used the definition",
