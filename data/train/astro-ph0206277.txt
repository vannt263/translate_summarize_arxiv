    "magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) can be split into two groups : those in which the magnetic field of the accreting white dwarf is strong enough ( @xmath1 10 mg ) to synchronise its spin period with that of the binary orbital period  the polars , and those with a magnetic field insufficiently strong to achieve this synchronisation  the intermediate polars ( ips ) .",
    "the mcv pq gem is unusual in that it exhibits characteristics of both groups : it shows a strong soft x - ray component ( @xmath250ev ) ( duck et al .",
    "1994 ) , it is polarised in the optical / ir wave - bands ( potter et al .",
    "1997 ; piirola , hakala & coyne 1993 ) and has an estimated magnetic field strength of @xmath0821 mg ( vth , chanmugam & frank 1996 ; potter et al . 1997 ; piirola et al .",
    "1993 )  all of which are characteristics of polars . on the other hand",
    "it shows a spin period of 833.4 sec ( mason 1997 ) and an orbital period of 5.19 hrs ( hellier , ramseyer & jablonski 1994 ) which are typical of ips .",
    "pq gem can therefore be thought of as the first true `` intermediate '' polar ( rosen , mittaz & hakala 1993 ) .",
    "pq gem has been observed using several x - ray satellites ( _ rosat _ , _ ginga _ , _ asca _ & _ rxte _ ) .",
    "the x - ray light curves show a prominent modulation on the spin period , in particular , a pronounced dip in the light curve which is thought to be due to an accretion stream obscuring the main emission region on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "mason ( 1997 ) made a study of the then available x - ray data to determine an accurate ephemeris for pq gem based on timings of the dip .",
    "however , a detailed study of the spectral information contained in the _ asca _ data was not undertaken .",
    "this paper is primarily targeted at reaching a greater understanding of the interplay between the emission sites and absorption which produces the observed modulation of the x - ray light curves .",
    "this is achieved through analysis of the _ asca _ spectral data with supporting evidence from the hard x - ray _ rxte _ light curves .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf is calculated from the _ rxte _ spectral data using the stratified accretion column model of cropper et al .",
    "( 1999 , subsequently cwrk ) .",
    "a fuller report is available in james ( 2001 ) .",
    "_ asca _ was launched in 1993 carrying two x - ray ccd cameras ( sis ) and two imaging gas scintillation proportional counters ( gis ) , and operated until 2000 ( tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) .",
    "the sis detectors covered the energy range of 0.4 kev to 10kev with an energy resolution of 2% at 5.9 kev .",
    "the gis detectors had an energy range of 0.7 kev to 10 kev with energy resolution of 8% at 5.9 kev .",
    "above 8kev the gis had a greater effective area than the sis .",
    "details of the observations of pq gem are given in table [ tab : ainstru ] .",
    "the sis detectors were configured to faint data mode 2-ccd ( high bit rate ) and 1-ccd ( medium bit rate ) clocking modes and the gis detectors were configured to ph - mode .",
    "it is not possible to merge data from the different types of detector or from different sis clocking modes without loss of information .",
    "hence the end product of the data selection and reduction was several data files with effective exposures ranging from 24.736.9ksec .",
    ".details of the _ asca _ observations and data used in the analysis for this paper .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      it is evident from an inspection of the 825 kev spin - phased _ rxte",
    "_ light curve ( figure 2 ) and the spin - phased normalisation in the _ asca _ spectroscopy ( figure 5 ) that they are broadly similar . as this emission",
    "is expected to be at most weakly beamed , this indicates that the variation in intensity is caused by changes in visibility of the x - ray emitting region as the white dwarf rotates .",
    "the phase of maximum emission therefore corresponds to the phase of maximum visibility of the emitting region .",
    "there is possibly a slight phase shift between the two curves , with a clear peak at @xmath3 = 0.2 in the _ rxte _ light curve , and a more extended maximum around 0.2 @xmath4 @xmath3 @xmath5 0.4 in the _ asca _ normalisation , but it is unclear given the uncertainties in the normalisations whether this is significant .",
    "spin phases 0.20.4 also correspond to the phases at which the accretion region in the upper hemisphere is seen most close to face on ( potter et al 1997 , figure 9 ) .",
    "this suggests that this is principle cause of the spin pulse modulation at higher energies .      at lower energies ,",
    "the maximum in the covering fraction of the absorber at @xmath3 = 0.0 is the major effect on the soft x - ray light curve , while the local increase at @xmath3 = 0.6 combined with the decrease in normalisation at this phase to cause the second minimum (  [ phasespect ] ) .",
    "potter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find that accretion occurs preferentially along field lines which thread the disc ahead of the accreting pole ( their figure 12 ) .",
    "material accreting along these field lines can therefore be identified as the source of the absorption at phase 0.0 .",
    "similarly , at @xmath3 = 0.6 , in the absence of absorption by the disc ( cf  [ doccult ] ) , the local increase in covering fraction is likely to be caused by absorbing material along field lines which intersect the line of sight to the lower pole ( potter et al .",
    "1997 , figure 9 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : phspct ] indicates that the change in absorption can be explained _ entirely _ by a change in covering fraction , with the column density of the absorber remaining constant . with reference to figure 9 of potter et al . ( 1997 ) , at @xmath3 = 0.0 , all of the field lines between the disc and the accreting pole will intersect the line of sight . at @xmath3",
    "= 0.2 , those field lines to the leading part of the accretion region will no longer intersect the line of sight , while by @xmath3 = 0.4 , only field lines to the trailing part of the accretion region will do so .",
    "if the column density through accreting field lines is @xmath6 @xmath7 , the observed variation in covering fraction in figure [ fig : phspct ] can be reproduced .",
    "the accretion flow may be more finely fragmented along field lines feeding the leading edge of the accretion region .",
    "this would be expected because finely fragmented material is threaded by the magnetic field more easily than the larger denser inhomogeneities ( e.g. wickramasinghe 1988 ) . from considerations of the packing fraction ,",
    "the line of sight through more finely fragmented material is less likely to pass between gaps in the flow than in the case of the larger inhomogeneities .",
    "this effect would reproduce the high covering fraction at @xmath3 = 0.0 , and its subsequent decrease towards @xmath3 = 0.5 .",
    "the accretion scenario we are proposing fits neither the standard occultation model of king & shaviv ( 1984 ) nor the accretion curtain model of rosen , mason & crdova ( 1988 ) .",
    "the orientation of the accretion region at spin phase maximum is as predicted by the occultation model , but with absorption effects modifying the light curve significantly . in this",
    "it is similar to the `` weak field / fast rotator '' model of norton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with the symmetry of the accretion curtain about the magnetic axis modified by the leading field lines preferentially stripping material from the inner margin of the disc .",
    "the high ( among ips ) magnetic field in pq gem and relatively high inclination and low dipole offset ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 , potter et al .",
    "1997 ) ensure that material on accreting field lines travels far enough out of the orbital plane to pass through the line of sight to the accretion region , causing the observed absorption effects . in this",
    "it differs substantially from ex hya which possesses a magnetic field @xmath5 1 mg .      finally , we check whether the accretion disk can extend close enough to the white dwarf for it to have an affect on the x - ray light curves by obscuring the lower emission region .",
    "using the ghosh & lamb formulation ( li , wickramasinghe & rudiger 1996 ) the radius to the truncated inner edge of the accretion disc , @xmath10 , is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the magnetic moment of the white dwarf .",
    "the magnetic moment can be estimated from the relationship @xmath13 . using the fits to the _ rxte _ data and the model of cwrk we found a best fit to the white dwarf radius , @xmath14 , of @xmath15 cm .",
    "hence , with a magnetic field strength , @xmath16 , of 15 mg ( piirola et al . 1993 , vth et al . 1996 , potter et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath17 g @xmath18 .",
    "the accretion luminosity , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the white dwarf and l@xmath21 is emitted mostly in the x - ray energy band , enables estimation of the accretion rate , @xmath22 .",
    "the unabsorbed spectral model from the analysis of the integrated spectrum (  [ intspct ] ) extrapolated for the energy range 0.001100.0kev gives the x - ray flux at @xmath23erg @xmath24 s@xmath25 which , taking the distance to pq gem of 400pc ( patterson 1994 ) , gives a luminosity of 6.0@xmath26erg s@xmath25 and hence a mass transfer rate rate , @xmath22 , of @xmath27 g s@xmath25 .",
    "this is typical for ips ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath28 cm or @xmath29 may be too large given that an estimate of the distance to the first lagrangian point is @xmath30 200 r@xmath31 ( plavec & kratochvil 1964 ) ( the main uncertainty in @xmath10 is in the magnetic moment @xmath12 ) .",
    "nevertheless it does indicate that with a system inclination of @xmath32 ( potter et al .",
    "1997 ) , the line of sight to the white dwarf surface is likely to be clear of the accretion disc at all spin phases , and this is unlikely to contribute to the cause of the covering fraction variation .      using the radius of the white dwarf , the specific mass accretion rate , @xmath33 , ( 2.3 g @xmath24s@xmath25 cf table [ tab : massfit ] ) and @xmath22 determined above we can derive a fractional accretion area , @xmath34 , of 9.0@xmath35 .",
    "this is within the normal expectation of 0.001@xmath36 0.02 for an ip ( rosen 1992 ) .",
    "however , from the _ rxte _ data @xmath22 = 2.9 @xmath37 g s@xmath25 which implies a fractional area of only 7.1 @xmath38 . refitting the _ rxte _ data to the model in which @xmath33 was fixed at 0.5 , 1.0 and 5.0",
    "g @xmath7 did not give a significant adverse effect on the fit ( @xmath39=0.91 , 0.89 , 0.86 , respectively ) .",
    "table [ tab : mdot ] gives the implied fractional area and @xmath22 for these @xmath33 as well as the results from the spectral fitting .",
    "for a low specific mass accretion rate we find that the implied fractional area is consistent with the lower limit determined using previous observations .",
    "previous determinations of the mass of the white dwarf in pq gem using an emission model fitted to _",
    "ginga _ data ( cropper et al",
    ". 1998 , 1999 ) gave estimates @xmath40 1.1 @xmath41 .",
    "in the case of the ip xy ari , ramsay et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that there was a good correspondence between the estimates given by this model and those from eclipse mapping . in our work",
    "it is found that the _ rxte _ data gives estimates which are very much better constrained than those made with the _ asca _ sis data .",
    "the estimate from our _ rxte _ data of @xmath42 = 1.21 ( 1.16 - 1.28 ) @xmath41 corresponds well to that of 1.21 ( @xmath43 obtained with _ ginga _",
    "although this appears to be unusually high ramsay ( 2000 ) found that the white dwarf in magnetic cvs were biased towards higher masses compared to isolated white dwarfs .",
