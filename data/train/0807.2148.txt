    "baryons form a rich family of particles which have been experimentally studied with high accuracy  @xcite . with the advent of new accelerators and detectors",
    "many properties of baryons containing a heavy quark have been experimentally measured in recent years  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical analysis of these experimental data gives a great deal of information about the structure of qcd and the numerical values of its parameters .",
    "the hypothetical limit @xmath5 for the number @xmath6 of quark and gluon colours in the symmetry group @xmath7 was especially successful for baryons  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this limit is a very powerful tool for the investigation of general properties of gauge interactions .",
    "the information about the spectrum of baryons is contained in the correlator of two baryonic currents and the spectral density associated with it . within the operator product expansion and to leading order in perturbative qcd",
    "the correlator is given by a product of @xmath6 fermionic propagators .",
    "the diagrams of this topology have been studied in some detail  @xcite .",
    "they are rather frequently used in phenomenological applications  @xcite . in general",
    ", these diagrams represent the leading order of the perturbative expansion for the relevant correlation functions . in some cases , though ( especially for the gluon current correlators  @xcite ) , they first appear at next - to - leading order .",
    "complete calculations beyond the leading order have not been done for many interesting cases . in this paper we fill this gap .",
    "we report on the results of calculating the @xmath8 corrections to the correlator of two baryonic currents with one finite mass quark and two massless quarks .",
    "we present analytical results and discuss the magnitude of the @xmath8 corrections for the physically interesting cases . the high energy ( massless quarks ) and near - threshold ( heavy quark effective theory , hqet )  @xcite limits are obtained from our general results as special cases . for these we find agreement with previous results in the literature .",
    "we present analytical results for the moments of the spectral density associated with correlators of baryonic currents .",
    "we briefly discuss the impact of our new results for the baryonic correlators on the phenomenology of baryons .",
    "however , the main aim of this paper is to present the results of the perturbative calculations in some detail and to show how they have been arrived at .",
    "the new technically demanding feature of our calculation is the presence of a finite - mass quark in the correlator which is needed for baryons containing a heavy charm or bottom quark . for the @xmath9-quark",
    "the accuracy of the hqet approximation is rather good .",
    "the exact result will help in controlling the precision of the approximation .",
    "for the @xmath10-quark , however , the accuracy of the near threshold approximation is insufficient for physical applications and the use of the exact formulas is unavoidable .    the massless case has been known since long ago  @xcite and serves as a test of the massless limit of our results .",
    "we mention that the mesonic analogue of our baryonic calculation with one finite mass quark and one massless antiquark was completed some time ago  @xcite and has subsequently provided a rich source of inspiration for many applications in meson physics .",
    "some of the techniques used in this paper have already been usefully employed in the analysis of perturbative corrections to sum rules involving pentaquark states  @xcite .",
    "in this section we present our choice of interpolating currents for baryons containing one heavy quark .",
    "we also introduce two - point correlation functions as the principal tool in our analysis of the static properties of heavy baryons .",
    "finally , we give an outline of the techniques that were used in our calculations .",

    "the interpolating current has the quantum numbers of a @xmath28 baryon .",
    "other baryonic currents with any given specified quantum numbers are obtained from the current in eq .",
    "( [ cur0 ] ) by using the appropriate dirac matrices or strings of dirac matrices .",
    "we first consider the simplest case and take @xmath26 , @xmath29 corresponding to an interpolating current with quantum numbers @xmath30 .",
    "this allows us to explain our techniques and to demonstrate the idiosyncratic features of the calculation . later in the text",
    "we will introduce more general interpolating currents and discuss calculational differences in comparison to those in the simplest case .",
    "the correlator of two baryonic currents can be expanded into a basis of invariant functions .",
    "the form of this expansion depends on the dirac matrices employed . in the simplest case @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath29 there are only two invariant functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the expansion which are defined through @xmath33 in the following we shall refer to the two contributions on the r.h.s . of ( [ def00gen ] ) as the mass and the momentum term , respectively .",
    "note that each of the replacements @xmath34 and @xmath35 leads to the change @xmath36 .",
    "the generic correlation function @xmath37 has a dispersion representation @xmath38 through its discontinuity @xmath39 on the physical cut @xmath40 , @xmath41 the discontinuity can also be written as the imaginary part of the correlation function if the phases are properly chosen , @xmath42 the expression for the discontinuity or spectral density @xmath39 is simpler than the expression for the correlation function @xmath37 itself .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath39 suffices for physical purposes and allows one to recover the whole function @xmath37 through a one - dimensional integral with a simple weight function as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispbasic ] ) .",
    "for this reason we concentrate on calculating the spectral density @xmath39 .",
    "the general strategy is rather straightforward .",
    "the main part of the calculation is done by using a symbolic manipulation program .",
    "one reduces all integrals to some basic master integrals and then one puts them together again to get the result for a particular correlator with any given quantum numbers .",
    "this program has been explicitly realized in our evaluation .",
    "the topology of the nlo diagrams is such that at least one line connecting the initial and final points of the diagram is free . if this line is the massive one , the remaining part of the diagram consists of massless lines and can be integrated analytically . adding the massive line leads to a one - dimensional integration which can be done analytically .",
    "if the massive line is part of the radiative corrections , the basic quantity is a nlo two - point correlator of the meson type with one heavy and one light quark . the spectral density for this nlo correlator is known to be computable .",
    "the fact that we only have one finite mass and a special topology of diagrams in the baryon sector therefore makes the analytical computation feasible .",
    "note that the computation with two different finite masses can still be done but requires a numerical calculation while some limiting cases such as the small mass ratio limit can still be done analytically .    in order to explain our main tools",
    ", we consider the correlation function of the baryonic current , which , up to nlo , can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 are one- and two - line correlators .",

    "if the one - line correlator is massless , the spectral density reads @xmath47 it is not difficult to obtain @xmath39 since @xmath48 is known from mesonic type calculations .",
    "all in all the calculation includes no unknown elements in the sense that all necessary blocks ( prototypes or masters ) are known to be calculable analytically .",
    "the main problem is the reduction of the initial diagrams to prototypes and the assembly of the final results from these building blocks .",
    "this has been done using the computer .    in the next section we present the calculation and results for the lowest spin baryons which means that the dirac matrices in the interpolating currents are just unity or @xmath49 .",
    "in this section we present the results for the simplest choice of the dirac structure of interpolating baryonic currents .",
    "we take @xmath26 and @xmath27 which corresponds to an interpolating current with quantum numbers @xmath28 .",
    "we can in fact omit @xmath49 in the process of the calculation because the effect of @xmath49 can later on be easily accounted for by a simple multiplication in dirac space . in this case the basic baryonic current has the form @xmath50 for this scalar case with @xmath51 , the results for the invariant functions @xmath32 and @xmath31 in eq .",
