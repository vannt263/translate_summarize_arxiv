    "popular models of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) include merging neutron stars ( paczyski 1986 , popham et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) , and merging neutron stars and stellar mass black holes ( paczyski 1991 , popham et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , the location of the recently detected grb afterglows indicates that the bursts may be located in star forming regions ( paczyski 1998 , kulkarni et al .",
    "1998a , b , taylor et al .",
    "1998 , galama et al . 1998 ) .",
    "if this indication is confirmed with the locations of the afterglows detected in the future , then the ns+ns and ns+bh merger scenario will be excluded , as those events are expected to occur far away from the place of their origin ( tutukov & yungelson 1994 , bloom et al 1998 , zwart & yungelson 1998 ) .",
    "still , the mergers are certainly happening , though at the rate estimated to be several orders of magnitude lower than supernova rate ( narayan et al .",
    "1991 , phinney 1991 , van den heuvel et al .",
    "1996 , bloom et al 1998 ) .",
    "it is virtually certain that a violent merger will eject some matter with a sub - relativistic velocity .",
    "the chemical composition of the ejecta must be very exotic as it is formed by a rapid decompression of nuclear density matter .",
    "it is not surprising that this process was suggested to be responsible for some exotic elements ( lattimer & schramm 1974 , 1976 , rosswog et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) . as",
    "most nuclides are initially very neutron rich , they will decay with various time scales .",
    "therefore , we expect a phenomenon somewhat similar to a supernovae type ia , in which the decay of @xmath0 first to @xmath1 , and later @xmath2 is responsible for the observed luminosity .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore the likely light curves following the ns+ns and/or ns+bh mergers .",
    "the neutron star mergers are expected to be among the first sources of gravitational radiation to be detected by the ligo ( abramovici et al .",
    ". it will be very important to detect the same events by other means . in the last several years",
    "a lot of effort went to obtain gamma - ray bursts from the mergers .",
    "however , theoretical attempts are discouraging ( cf .",
    "ruffert & janka 1997 , 1998 , and references therein ) , and the observed locations of the burst afterglows does not favor the merger .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to point out that the mergers are likely to be accompanied with prominent optical transients , which should be detectable with the future supernova searches , and perhaps have already been detected by schmidt et al .",
    "modeling of a ns+ns or a ns+bh merger is very complex , and our knowledge of the outcome is very limited .",
    "therefore , instead of attempting to develop a complete numerical model ( ruffert & janka 1997 , 1998 , and references therein ) we make the simplest possible substitute , a ` one zone model ' of an expanding envelope . while most of the mass falls into the black hole some matter is ejected as a result of the complicated hydrodynamics of the merger , or the powerful neutrino burst , or the super - strong magnetic fields . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the expanding envelope is spherical , its mass @xmath3 is constant with time , and its density @xmath4 is uniform in space and decreases with time .",
    "the surface radius @xmath5 increases at the fixed velocity @xmath6 , i.e. we ignore dynamical effect of the pressure gradient .",
    "therefore , the density throughout is given as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the time from the beginning of expansion .",
    "all complications of the initial conditions : the high temperature , the neutrino burst , and the chemical composition , are absorbed into several input parameters of our models : @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and the energy available for the radioactive decays .",
    "the temperature inside the expanding sphere varies because of several effects : adiabatic expansion , heat generation in radioactive decays , and radiative heat losses from the surface .",
    "let us consider each of these effects .",
    "_ adiabatic expansion . _",
    "the density of expanding envelope rapidly becomes very low , while the injection of a large amount of heat keeps it hot , and radiation energy density dominates gas energy density .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the energy density , @xmath11 is the pressure , @xmath12 is the temperature , and @xmath13 is the radiation constant .",
    "following the first law of thermodynamics the variation of entropy @xmath14 per unit mass is @xmath15    _ radioactive heating . _",
    "assume that the radioactive decay of an element isotopes proceeds on a time scale @xmath16 , and releases a total amount of energy equivalent to a fraction @xmath17 of the rest mass , so the heat generation rate per gram per second is @xmath18 if there are several decaying element isotopes , the total heat generation rate is the sum of that of individual element isotopes .",
    "if there are many decaying element isotopes with different decaying time scales , the summation can be replaced by an integration .",
    "nuclear lifetimes are distributed roughly uniformly in logarithmic intervals in time , thus the total heat generation rate may be approximated as @xmath19    _ radiative losses .",
    "_ the temperature gradient is @xmath20 , the average opacity is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the opacity caused by electron scattering ) , and the radiative diffusion leads to the heat losses from the surface which are approximately given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the stephan - boltzmann constant , @xmath25 is the effective temperature . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the diffusion approximation , which requires that the optical depth of the expanding sphere to be much larger than unity , i.e. @xmath26 . the critical time @xmath27 when the expanding sphere becomes optically thin is given by @xmath28 , thus @xmath29    the overall heat balance is given by @xmath30 combining eqs .",
    "( [ rh]-[l ] ) , we obtain the equation for the variation of internal energy @xmath31    define @xmath32 then eq .  ( [ tem1 ] ) can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 for the case of exponential law decay ; or @xmath35 for the case of power law decay .",
    "define @xmath36 then the luminosity of the black body radiation can be written as @xmath37 the effective temperature is given by @xmath38 all these equations are applicable to the optically thick case , i.e. for @xmath39 .",
    "there are general properties of the eq .",
    "( [ tem2 ] ) which do not depend on the specific form of the radioactive energy generation term , @xmath40 . at the very",
    "beginning of expansion , at the time of the order of a millisecond , the dimensionless time @xmath41 , and the internal energy term @xmath42 is likely to be very large .",
    "the initial evolution is well approximated with the adiabatic expansion , and the radiative heat loss term @xmath43 , and the heat generation term @xmath44 can be both neglected .",
    "the thermal evolution changes when the radioactive heat term becomes important , and it changes again when the radiative heat losses from the surface become important .",
    "however , the initial phase of adiabatic expansion makes the expanding sphere forget its initial thermal conditions .",
    "for this reason , in all the subsequent discussion of the analytical solution the initial conditions are found to be unimportant .      for the case of exponential law decay , @xmath45 is given in eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) . the analytic solution of eq .",
    "( [ tem2 ] ) is @xmath46 + \\alpha\\sqrt{8\\beta\\over3}~y\\left[\\sqrt{3\\over8\\beta}\\left ( \\tau-{4\\over3}\\alpha\\beta\\right)\\right]\\right\\ } , \\label{sol1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dawson s integral @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 @xmath49 is the integral constant which is determined by the initial condition .",
    "the solution is practically insensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "for example , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , the solution ` forgets ' the initial conditions after @xmath54 .",
    "thus @xmath49 is roughly @xmath55.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the luminosity is @xmath56 + \\alpha\\sqrt{8\\beta\\over3}~y\\left[\\sqrt{3\\over8\\beta}\\left ( \\tau-{4\\over3}\\alpha\\beta\\right)\\right]\\right\\}. \\label{lu11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    though these exact solutions are interesting for theories , they are not convenient to be used in practice .",
    "thus here we also give some approximate solutions which are simple and convenient to be used in practice and have clear physical meanings .",
    "we have already defined two time scales : @xmath57 , on which radioactive energy source decays exponentially , and @xmath58 on which the optical depth of the expanding sphere is reduced to one .",
    "there is a third time scale @xmath59 on which photons diffuse out of the sphere .",
    "of particular importance is @xmath60 when the photon diffusion time scale is equal to the radioactivity time scale , and @xmath61 when the photon diffusion time becomes comparable to the expansion time .    if @xmath62 ( thus @xmath63 ) , the evolution of the expanding sphere can be divided into three regimes .",
    "the first regime is from @xmath64 to @xmath65 . in this regime",
    "we may neglect the luminosity in the energy balance , i.e. we may neglect the term @xmath43 in the eq .",
    "( [ tem2 ] ) , and we obtain @xmath66 , \\hskip 1 cm l \\approx { l_0 \\over \\alpha }   \\left [ 1 - ( 1 + \\alpha \\tau ) e^ { - \\alpha \\tau } \\right ] , \\hskip 1 cm t \\ll t_{\\rm r } , \\label{l2}\\ ] ] @xmath67 reaches maximum at @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . the second regime is from @xmath70 to @xmath71 . during this regime , since @xmath72 , the radioactive term @xmath45 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tem2 ] ) can be neglected , the resultant equation describes a radiation system cooling through expanding and radiative processes .",
    "the solution of the resultant equation is @xmath73 where the integral constant is determined by joining this solution with the solution before @xmath70 .",
    "the third regime is for @xmath74 , when the photon diffusion time scale is much smaller than the radioactive time scale .",
    "in such a case , the radiative energy loss is balanced by the energy deposited from radioactive decay , and the luminosity is simply @xmath75 since @xmath76 , for the sub - relativistic case ( @xmath77 ) this third regime happens in the optically thin regime , the radiation given by ( [ sol7 ] ) should be non - thermal .",
    "the peak luminosity is @xmath78 , which goes down as @xmath79 increases .    if @xmath80 ( thus @xmath81 ) , the evolution of the expanding shell can be divided into two regimes .",
    "the first regime is from @xmath64 to @xmath70 . during this period , since @xmath82",
    ", the radioactive source @xmath83 can be approximated by @xmath84 . inserting @xmath84 into eq .",
    "( [ tem2 ] ) , we get @xmath85 the second regime is for @xmath86 , during which the diffusion time scale is much smaller than the radioactive time scale , the radioactive decay energy is balanced by radiative energy loss , and thus the luminosity is given by eq .",
    "( [ sol7 ] ) .",
    "if it is extended into the optically thin regime , the radiation should become non - thermal for @xmath87 .",
    "the peak of the luminosity is roughly at the cross of the light curves given by eqs .",
    "( [ sol7 ] ) and ( [ sol5 ] ) , and the corresponding peak luminosity @xmath88 and time @xmath89 are @xmath90^{1/2 } .\\ ] ] the @xmath88 increases with @xmath79 .    from the above discussion we see that , for @xmath91 , the peak luminosity goes up as @xmath79 increases ; for @xmath62 , the peak luminosity goes down as @xmath79 increases .",
    "thus , the peak luminosity reaches its maximum roughly at @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 , which is comparable with @xmath27 for sub - relativistic case ) , where we have the biggest peak luminosity @xmath94 .",
    "the light curves are shown in fig .  1 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( thus @xmath99 s @xmath100 day , @xmath101 k , @xmath102 erg / s , and @xmath103 ) , and @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "the initial condition is taken to be @xmath110 ( but the results are insensitive to the initial condition ) . since for @xmath111",
    "we have @xmath112 which joins smoothly with @xmath113 , eq .",
    "( [ lu11 ] ) can be formally extended to optically thin region , but we must keep in mind that in optically thin case the radiation is non - thermal .",
    "the evolution of our model with the exponential decay law is shown in the @xmath114 diagram in fig .  2 for the case of @xmath115 .",
    "the numerical results agree very well with our analytical estimates of the parameters important for observers : the time from the beginning of expansion to the peak luminosity , the peak luminosity , the temperature at the peak luminosity , and the time it takes for the luminosity to fall down by a factor 3 from the peak .",
    "the exponential decay model was useful in demonstrating that the very short and very long time scale radioactivity is of little use for generating a large luminosity .",
    "the most efficient conversion of nuclear energy to the observable luminosity is provided by the elements with the decay time scale @xmath57 comparable to @xmath116 , when the expanding sphere becomes optically thin . in reality",
    ", there is likely to be a large number of nuclides with a very broad range of decay time scales .",
    "therefore , it is more realistic to adopt a power law decay model , which automatically selects the most efficient radioactive time scales .    in the case of power law decay , @xmath45 is given with eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "the analytic solution of eq .",
    "( [ tem2 ] ) is @xmath117 where the integration constant @xmath118 is determined by the initial condition .",
    "similar to the case of exponential law decay , in practice the solution is insensitive to the initial condition . in this approximation , we have @xmath119 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity is given by @xmath120    for positive @xmath121 , @xmath122 has the maximum value at @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "thus , the time from the beginning of expansion to the peak luminosity is @xmath125 the peak luminosity is @xmath126 the effective temperature at the peak luminosity is @xmath127 from eq .",
    "( [ lu2 ] ) , the time when the luminosity is down a factor 3 from the peak luminosity is @xmath128 , which is in the optically thin epoch for the sub - relativistic case ( @xmath129 ) . for the optically thin case ,",
    "the luminosity of the ( non - thermal ) radiation from the expanding shell is roughly given by @xmath130 , which is formally the asymptotic form of eq .",
    "( [ lu2 ] ) for @xmath86 [ @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ lu2 ] ) can be formally extended to the optically thin region , where the radiation is non - thermal .",
    "the time from the peak luminosity to the luminosity down a factor 3 from the peak is roughly given by @xmath133    fig .",
    "3 shows light curves drawn from eq .",
    "( [ lu2 ] ) with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath134 , and @xmath97 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 respectively .",
    "4 shows the evolution of the expanding shell in the @xmath114 diagram for the case of @xmath97 .",
    "note that the peak luminosity is proportional to @xmath137 , and the shape of the light curve , and all the time scales , are independent of @xmath137 [ cf .",
    "( [ lu2 ] - [ lu6 ] ) ] .",
    "our model is so simple , that it can provide only an order of magnitude estimate of the peak luminosity and the time scale of a transient event that is likely to follow a violent merger of two neutron stars or a merger between a neutron star and a stellar mass black hole .",
    "the eqs .",
    "( [ lu2 ] - [ lu6 ] ) , and figs .  3 and 4",
    "provide a convenient representation of our model , and a simple relation between the poorly known input parameters : the mass of the ejecta @xmath3 , their velocity @xmath6 , and the fraction of rest mass energy available for radioactive decays , and the observable parameters .",
    "note , that for a plausible set of input parameters the transient reaches peak luminosity @xmath138 , corresponding to the bolometric luminosity of @xmath139 , i.e. in the bright supernova range .",
    "however , the duration of the luminous phase is likely to be only @xmath140 day , i.e. much shorter than a supernova .",
    "the duration can be extended if the ejecta have a large mass and expand slowly [ cf .",
    "( [ lu3 ] ) ] .",
    "while there are many improvements our model requires , the single most important is a quantitative estimate of the abundances and the lifetimes of the radioactive nuclides that form in the rapid decompression of nuclear density matter .",
    "it is possible that rosswog et al .",
    "( 1998 ) may readily provide this improvement .",
    "as the frequency of such events is expected to be @xmath141 times lower than the supernova rate ( narayan et al .",
    "1991 , phinney 1991 , van den heuvel et al .",
    "1996 , bloom et al 1998 ) , they may be detected soon in the supernovae searches .",
    "the merger events are likely to be hotter than supernovae , which can make them easier to detect at large redshifts .",
    "the dust extinction which affects some supernovae is not likely to be a problem , as the mergers are expected far from star forming regions , many of them ( perhaps most of them ) outside of parent galaxies ( tutukov & yungelson 1994 , bloom et al 1998 , zwart & yungelson 1998 ) .",
    "it is very intriguing that the high redshift supernova search ( schmidt at al .",
    "1998 ) revealed mystery optical transients which typically have no host galaxy , as would be expected of neutron star mergers . in principle",
    "it should be fairly straightforward to test our suggestion by measuring future mystery events in at least four photometric bands , so that at least three colors would be available . in the optically thick phase",
    "our model would follow a locus occupied by ordinary stars in the color - color - color diagram , evolving along a line corresponding to a fixed redshift and changing effective temperature .",
    "as soon as the expanding matter becomes optically thin the colors would deviate significantly from the area occupied by any star with a more or less normal photosphere ."
