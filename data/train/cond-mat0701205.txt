    "fundamental properties and potential applications of carbon - based structures are of interest in emerging nanoelectronic applications .",
    "particularly promising is graphene , which is a planar atomic layer of carbon atoms bonded in a hexagonal structure .",
    "graphene is the two - dimensional version of graphite , and a single - wall carbon nanotube can be thought of as graphene rolled into a tube @xcite .",
    "only recently has it become possible to fabricate ultrathin graphite , consisting of only a few graphene layers @xcite@xcite , and actual graphene @xcite@xcite . in graphene ,",
    "the energy - momentum relationship for electrons is linear over a wide range of energies , rather then quadratic , so that electrons in graphene behave as massless relativistic particles ( dirac fermions ) with an energy - independent velocity .",
    "graphene s band structure , together with it s extreme thinness , leads to a pronounced electric field effect @xcite , @xcite , which is the variation of a material s carrier concentration with electrostatic gating .",
    "this is the governing principle behind traditional semiconductor device operation , and therefore this effect in graphene is particularly promising for the development of ultrathin carbon nanoelectronic devices .",
    "although the electric field effect also occurs in atomically thin metal films , these tend to be thermodynamically unstable , and do not form continuous layers with good transport properties .",
    "in contrast , graphene is stable , and , like its cylindrical carbon nanotube versions , can exhibit ballistic transport over at least submicron distances @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that graphene s conductance has a minimum , non - zero value associated with the conductance quantum , even when charge carrier concentrations vanish @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the interaction of an electromagnetic current source and graphene is considered .",
    "the electromagnetic fields are governed by maxwell s equations , and the graphene is represented by a conductivity surface @xcite that must arise from a microscopic quantum - dynamical model , or from measurement .",
    "the method assumes laterally infinite graphene residing at the interface between two dielectrics , in which case classical maxwell s equations are solved exactly for an arbitrary electrical current .",
    "related phenomena are discussed , such as plane - wave reflection and transmission through graphene @xcite , and surface wave excitation and guidance , which is relevant to high - frequency electronic applications .",
    "it is found that the relative importance of the interband and intraband contributions to the conductivity dictate surface wave behavior @xcite , and that surface wave propagation can be controlled by varying the chemical potential .",
    "although at this time only graphene samples with lateral dimensions on the order of tens of microns have been fabricated , the infinite sheet model provides a first step in analyzing electromagnetic properties of graphene .",
    "it is also relevant to sufficiently large finite - sized sheets , assuming that electronic edge effects and electromagnetic edge diffraction can be ignored . in the following all units",
    "are in the si system , and the time variation ( suppressed ) is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the imaginary unit .",
    "figure 1 depicts laterally - infinite graphene lying in the @xmath6 plane at the interface between two different mediums characterized by @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 , where all material parameters may be complex - valued .",
    "the graphene is modeled as an infinitesimally - thin , local two - sided surface characterized by a surface conductivity @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is radian frequency , @xmath13 is chemical potential , @xmath14 is a phenomenological scattering rate that is assumed to be independent of energy @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is temperature .",
    "the conductivity of graphene has been considered in several recent works @xcite@xcite , and here we use the expression resulting from the kubo formula @xcite,@xmath17 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the charge of an electron , @xmath19 is the reduced planck s constant , @xmath20 is the fermi - dirac distribution , and @xmath21 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "we assume that no external magnetic field is present , and so the local conductivity is isotropic ( i.e. , there is no hall conductivity ) .",
    "the first term in ( [ gsc ] ) is due to intraband contributions , and the second term to interband contributions .",
    "for an isolated graphene sheet the chemical potential @xmath13 is determined by the carrier density @xmath22,@xmath23 where @xmath24 m / s is the fermi velocity .",
    "the carrier density can be controlled by application of a gate voltage and/or chemical doping .",
    "for the undoped , ungated case at @xmath25 k , @xmath26 .    the intraband term in ( [ gsc ] ) can be evaluated as@xmath27 for the case @xmath28 , ( [ intralr ] ) was first derived in @xcite for graphite ( with the addition of a factor to account for the interlayer separation between graphene planes ) , and corresponds to the intraband conductivity of a single - wall carbon nanotube in the limit of infinite radius @xcite . with @xmath29 , it can be seen that @xmath30 and @xmath31 . as will be discussed",
    "later , the imaginary part of conductivity plays an important role in the propagation of surface waves guided by the graphene sheet @xcite .",
    "the interband conductivity can be approximated for @xmath32 as @xcite,@xmath33 such that for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 with @xmath37 . for @xmath34 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 is complex - valued , with @xcite@xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 .      for any planarly",
    "layered , piecewise - constant medium , the electric and magnetic fields in region @xmath43 due to an electric current can be obtained as @xcite@xcite@xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the wavenumber and electric hertzian potential in region @xmath43 , respectively . assuming that the current source is in region 1 , then@xmath47 where the underscore indicates a dyadic quantity , and where @xmath48 is the support of the current . with @xmath49",
    "parallel to the interface normal , the principle greens dyadic can be written as @xcite@xmath50 where@xmath51 and where @xmath52 is a radial wavenumber and @xmath53 is the unit dyadic .",
    "the scattered green s dyadics can be obtained by enforcing the usual electromagnetic boundary conditions @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( a / m ) and @xmath56 ( v / m ) are electric and magnetic surface currents on the boundary . for a local model of graphene in the absence of a magnetic field and associated hall effect conductivity , @xmath57 is a scalar .",
    "therefore @xcite , @xmath58 and ( [ bcme ] ) becomes @xmath59 using ( [ ffp ] ) , the boundary conditions on the hertzian potential at @xmath60 are@xmath61 @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in the absence of magnetic contrast ( e.g. , if @xmath65 ) and surface conductivity , boundary conditions ( [ ccg1])([ccg4 ] ) are identical to the hertzian potential boundary conditions presented @xcite .    enforcing ( [ ccg1])([ccg4 ] ) and following the method described in @xcite , the scattered green s dyadic is found to be@xmath66 where the sommerfeld integrals are@xmath67 @xmath68 , with@xmath69   } { z^{h}z^{e } } , \\label{rtcn3}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reduce to the previously known results as @xmath70 .",
    "the green s dyadic for region 2 , @xmath71 , has the same form as for region 1 , although in ( [ sgf3 ] ) the replacement@xmath72 must be made , where @xmath73   } { n^{2}z^{h}z^{e}}. \\label{r4}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as in the case of a simple dielectric interface , the denominators @xmath74 implicate pole singularities in the spectral plane associated with surface wave phenomena .",
    "furthermore , both waveparameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , lead to branch points at @xmath77 , and thus the @xmath52-plane is a four - sheeted riemann surface . the standard hyperbolic branch cuts",
    "@xcite that separate the one proper sheet ( where @xmath78 , such that the radiation  condition as @xmath79 is satisfied ) and the three improper sheets ( where @xmath80 ) are the same as in the absence of surface conductivity @xmath57 .",
    "in addition to representing the exact field from a given current , several interesting electromagnetic aspects of graphene can be obtained from the above relations .",
    "normal incidence plane - wave reflection and transmission coefficients can be obtained from the previous formulation by setting @xmath81 in ( [ rtcn ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) . to see this , consider the current @xmath82 where @xmath83 or @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and where @xmath86 .",
    "this current leads to a unit - amplitude , @xmath87-polarized , transverse electromagnetic plane wave , normally - incident on the interface .",
    "the far scattered field in region 1 , which is the reflected field , can be obtained by evaluating the spectral integral ( [ sgf3 ] ) using the method of steepest descents , which leads to the reflected field @xmath88 , where the reflection coefficient is @xmath89 . in a similar manner , the far scattered field in region 2 , the transmitted field ,",
    "is obtained as @xmath90 , where the transmission coefficient is @xmath91 .",
    "therefore,@xmath92 where @xmath93 is the wave impedance in region @xmath43 . the plane - wave reflection and transmission coefficients obviously reduce to the correct results for @xmath94 , and in the limit @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 as expected .    in the special case @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 where @xmath101 ohms .",
    "the reflection coefficient agrees with the result presented in @xcite for normal incidence .",
    "pole singularities in the sommerfeld integrals represent discrete surface waves guided by the medium @xcite@xcite . from ( [ rtcn])([rtcn3 ] ) and ( [ r2])([r4 ] ) , the dispersion equation for surface waves that are transverse - electric ( te ) to the propagation direction @xmath102 ( also known as @xmath103-waves )",
    "is@xmath104 whereas for transverse - magnetic ( tm ) waves ( @xmath105-waves),@xmath106 in the limit that @xmath98 , @xmath107 agree with te and tm dispersion equations in @xcite    the surface wave field can be obtained from the residue contribution of the sommerfeld integrals .",
    "for example , the electric field in region @xmath108 associated with the surface wave excited by a hertzian dipole current @xmath109 is@xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the term @xmath114 leads to exponential decay away from the graphene surface on the proper sheet ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the surface wave mode may or may not lie on the proper riemann sheet , depending on the value of surface conductivity , as described below . in general , only modes on the proper sheet directly result in physical wave phenomena , although leaky modes on the improper sheet can be used to approximate parts of the spectrum in restricted spatial regions , and to explain certain radiation phenomena @xcite .",
    "noting that @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the relative material parameters ( i.e. , @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 is the free - space wavenumber , then if @xmath65 ( @xmath122 ) the te dispersion equation ( [ zh ] ) can be solved for the radial surface wave propagation constant , yielding@xmath123 if , furthermore , @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , then ( [ ksw1 ] ) reduces to @xmath126 for the case @xmath127 , then ( [ zh ] ) leads to@xmath128    considering the special case of graphene in free - space , setting @xmath129 , @xmath130 if @xmath57 is real - valued ( @xmath131 ) and @xmath132 , then a fast propagating mode exists , and if @xmath133 the wave is either purely attenuating or growing in the radial direction . however , in both cases @xmath134 from ( [ zh ] ) , and so @xmath135 is violated .",
    "therefore , for isolated graphene with @xmath57 real - valued ( i.e. , when @xmath136 , at low temperatures and small @xmath13 ) , all te modes are on the improper riemann sheet . the fast leaky mode may play a role in radiation from the structure .",
    "if the conductivity is pure imaginary , @xmath137 , then @xmath138 and a slow wave exists . in this case @xmath139 and if @xmath1 then @xmath140 and the wave is a slow surface wave on the proper sheet .",
    "this will occur when the interband conductivity dominates over the intraband contribution , as described in @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath2 , which occurs when the intraband contribution dominates , the mode is exponentially growing in the vertical direction and is a leaky wave on the improper sheet .    more generally , for complex conductivity , @xmath141 and therefore if @xmath2 the mode is on the improper sheet , whereas if @xmath1 a surface wave on the proper sheet is obtained .",
    "tm waves are governed by the dispersion equation ( [ ze ] ) . for general material parameters",
    "this relation is more complicated then for the te case , and so here we concentrate on an isolated graphene surface ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "then , @xmath142 and @xmath143 if @xmath57 is real - valued then @xmath140 is violated and tm modes are on the improper riemann sheet .",
    "if conductivity is pure imaginary , then @xmath138 and a slow wave exists .",
    "since @xmath144 , if @xmath1 then the wave is on the improper sheet , and if @xmath2 the mode is a slow surface wave on the proper sheet . for complex conductivity ,",
    "@xmath145 and therefore if @xmath2 ( intraband conductivity dominates ) the mode is a surface wave on the proper sheet , whereas if @xmath146 ( interband conductivity dominates ) the mode is on the improper sheet .    in summary , for isolated graphene",
    "a proper te surface wave exists if @xmath1 , resulting in the radial wavenumber ( [ tesw ] ) , and a proper tm surface wave with wavenumber ( [ tmsw ] ) is obtained for @xmath2 .",
    "the same conclusions hold for graphene in a homogeneous dielectric . for graphene with @xmath147 ,",
    "no surface - wave propagation is possible .",
    "note that this only refers to wave - propagation effects ; dc or low - frequency transport between electrodes can occur , leading to electronic device possibilities .",
    "in fact , in devices not based on wave phenomena , the absence of surface waves is usually beneficial , as spurious radiation and coupling effects , and the associated degradation of device performance , are often associated with surface wave excitation .",
    "the degree of confinement of the surface wave to the graphene layer can be gauged by defining an attenuation length @xmath148 , at which point the wave decays to @xmath149 of its value on the surface .",
    "for graphene embedded in a homogeneous medium characterized by @xmath15 and @xmath150 , @xmath151 , leading to @xmath152 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath153 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "when normalized to wavelength,@xmath154 obviously , strong confinement arises from large imaginary conductivity , as would be expected .",
    "in this section , some results are shown for surface wave characteristics of graphene in the microwave and infrared regimes . in all cases @xmath155 mev , @xmath156 k , and",
    "an isolated graphene surface ( i.e. , when the surrounding medium is vacuum ) is considered .",
    "the value of the scattering rate is chosen to be approximately the same as for electron - acoustic phonon interactions in single - wall carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "we first consider the case of zero chemical potential at microwave and far - infrared wave frequencies .",
    "2 shows the complex conductivity , tm surface - wave wavenumber ( [ tmsw ] ) , and attenuation length ( [ atntm ] ) . in this case",
    "the intraband conductivity is dominant over the interband contribution , and so @xmath2 , such that only a tm surface wave can exist .",
    "the dispersion of the complex conductivity follows simply from the drude form ( [ intralr ] ) . at low frequencies the tm surface wave",
    "is poorly confined to the graphene surface ( @xmath157 ) , and therefore it is lightly damped and relatively fast ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) . as frequency increases into the far - infrared , the surface wave becomes more tightly confined to the graphene layer , but becomes slow as energy is concentrated on the graphene surface .",
    "the conductivity can be varied by adjusting the chemical potential , which is governed by the carrier density via ( [ cd ] ) .",
    "the carrier density can be changed by either chemical doping or by the application of a bias voltage .",
    "3 shows the interband and intraband conductivity as a function of chemical potential for @xmath159 @xmath150ev ( @xmath160 ghz )",
    ". as expected , the conductivity increases with increasing chemical potential , associated with a higher carrier density @xmath22 . because intraband conductivity is dominant , @xmath3 remains negative as chemical potential is varied , and therefore only a tm surface wave may propagate .",
    "the insert shows the real part of the intraband conductivity ( the dominant term ) on a linear scale , showing the linear dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath13 .",
    "since the tm surface - wave is not well confined to the graphene surface at lower microwave frequencies , it undergoes little dispersion with respect to chemical potential .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , where the tm wavenumber and attenuation length are shown as a function of chemical potential at @xmath159 @xmath150ev . because of the simple form for the tm surface - wave wavenumber ( [ tmsw ] ) , the wavenumber and attenuation length merely follow the conductivity profile .    however , at infrared frequencies moderate changes in the chemical potential can significantly alter graphene s conductivity , and , significantly , change the sign of its imaginary part .",
    "5 shows the various components of the graphene conductivity at @xmath161 ev ( @xmath162 thz ) , and in fig .",
    "6 the total conductivity ( interband plus intraband ) is shown . from ( [ inter ] ) , at @xmath163 an abrupt change in @xmath39 occurs when @xmath164 , which in this case is @xmath165 ev , denoted by the vertical dashed lines in the figures . since the associated fermi temperature is several thousand k , the @xmath25 behavior qualitatively remains the same at @xmath166 k , although the discontinuity is softened due to the higher temperature .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath167 less than approximately @xmath168 ev , @xmath169 dominates over @xmath170 and @xmath1 , so that only a proper te surface wave mode exists .",
    "outside of this range , only a tm surface wave propagates .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "7 , where it can be seen that the tm mode is moderately dispersive with chemical potential , especially in the region of the sign change in @xmath3 near @xmath171 ev , since the tm surface wave is fairly well confined to the graphene surface ( @xmath172 ) .  in the region where @xmath3 is positive ,",
    "the te mode exists but is poorly confined to the graphene surface , and so it is essentially nondispersive and very lightly damped .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the attenuation length @xmath173 follows simply from the form of @xmath3 via ( [ atnte ] ) .    in fig .",
    "8 the conductivity is shown as a function of frequency in the infrared regime for a fixed value of chemical potential , @xmath174 ev , at @xmath166 k. the dispersion behavior of the conductivity follows simply from ( [ intralr ] ) and ( [ inter ] ) .",
    "the point @xmath164 occurs at @xmath175 ev ( @xmath176 thz ) , whereupon the interband contribution dominates and @xmath3 becomes positive ( the intraband contribution varies as @xmath177 for @xmath178 , and so becomes small at sufficiently high infrared frequencies ) . for comparison ,",
    "the @xmath25 result is also shown .",
    "9 shows the tm and te wavenumbers and attenuation lengths for the conductivity profile given in fig .",
    "8 . for @xmath179",
    "ev only a tm surface wave exists since @xmath2 , and for @xmath180 ev only a te surface wave exists due to @xmath1 . from fig .",
    "8 it is clear that above @xmath181 ev , @xmath182 , and so@xmath183 the tm mode is tightly confined to the graphene surface , and from ( [ krtma ] ) it can be seen that in vicinity of the transition point at @xmath175 ev , where @xmath184 , @xmath185 will be large and the tm mode will be highly damped . just to the right of the transition , from ( [ krtea ] ) the te wavenumber is predominately real , and so the te mode is very lightly damped . from ( [ atnte ] ) it is clear that @xmath186 , and so the te mode is not well confined to the surface in this frequency range .",
