    "in this paper we develop a procedure , called spherical alteration , for modifying handle decompositions of manifolds in ways that permit useful applications .",
    "the strategy is geometrically quite simple , but at the same time more drastic than the traditional techniques of handle slides , introductions and cancellations of complementary handle pairs , and the carving out and inserting of existing handles . in order to obtain the intended applications , each alteration of a handle",
    "is accompanied by associated alterations of related submanifolds . taken together , these moves constitute the process of spherical alteration .",
    "since there are several variables involved , a full description of the procedure is a bit technical  we save that for section [ section : spherical alteration ] . in some sense ,",

    "_    _ ( b ) as an added bonus , our proof of theorem [ introth : epc ] provides a new twist on the existence proof for plus cobordisms  an argument that requires very little discussion of bundles and framings .",
    "_    we will further exhibit the usefulness of the spherical alteration technique by proving a generalization of theorem [ introth : epc ] .",
    "that generalization is motivated by ongoing work on ends of noncompact manifolds .",
    "it and a similar application of spherical alteration , also presented here , play key roles in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these latter two applications are not obtainable by the nonconstructive approach to theorem [ introth : epc ] used in @xcite .",
    "in this section we provide brief reviews of several topics and introduce a good deal of notation to be used later in this paper .",
    "those topics are :    * intersection numbers between submanifolds , * surgering surfaces to disks and 2-spheres , * perfect groups and ` near perfect ' subgroups , * basics of handle theory , and * unbased spheres as elements of homotopy groups .    throughout this paper",
    "we work in the category of piecewise - linear manifolds ; analogous results in the smooth and topological categories may be obtained in the usual ways .",
    "one of the simplest types of intersection number is defined when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are closed , connected , oriented submanifolds of the interior of an oriented @xmath11-manifold @xmath12 .",

    "an important such case occurs when one of the submanifolds , say @xmath10 , is a @xmath47-sphere ; there we salvage ` well - definedness '  by requiring that @xmath27 be the unique arc of @xmath10 running from @xmath48 to @xmath14 in the orientation preserving direction .",
    "another useful variation occurs when the fundamental group of @xmath9 or @xmath10 includes trivially into the that of @xmath12 , in which case that submanifold need not be simply connected .",
