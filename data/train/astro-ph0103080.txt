    "ae aqr has been classified ( see , e.g. , p94 , ",
    "2.4.2 ) as member of the dq her or intermediate polar ( ip ) cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) . such cvs are binary star systems in which a rotating magnetic white dwarf ( playing the role of `` primary '' ) and a late - type main - sequence star ( playing the role of `` secondary '' ) are adjusted in a highly confined orbit ( i.e. , orbit with orbital separation less than a few solar radii ) .",
    "the secondary extends out to its critical roche equipotential surface and small motions of thermal origin in its atmosphere lead to gas flow ( through the inner lagrangian point of the binary ) into the potential well of the primary",
    ". this gas forms an accretion disk , which is an efficient machine at converting gravitational energy to radiation and heat , and at redistributing angular momentum .",
    "the accretion disk is disrupted at the alfvn radius and , eventually , the accretion flow is channelled towards the poles of the primary through magnetic columns ( p94 ,  2.1 ) .",
    "however , ae aqr is characterized by some unusual properties .",
    "we mention here its violent flaring activity , with recurrence timescale @xmath7 , from the ultraviolet ( uv ) ( e&94 ,  ",
    "24 ) to the radio frequencies ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also remarkable that its spin period , @xmath8 ( the shortest one among ips ) , has been detected and verified over a wide range of frequencies , from the optical ( @xcite ) to the @xmath9-rays ( @xcite , m&94 ,   23 , 6 ) .",
    "further unusual properties of ae aqr are discussed by , e.g. , i95 (  1 ) , whg95 (  1 ) , c&96 (  1 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* (   2 , 45 ) ) , i97 (  1 ) , k&97 (  1 ) , and wkh97 (  1 ) .    concerning the subject of the present investigation , emphasis is given on the puzzling rapid spin - down time rate , @xmath0 , reported by dj&94 (   67 , table 4 ) .",
    "the implications of such a spin - down have been discussed by several investigators ( see , e.g. , dj&94 ,  8 ; whg95 ,  1 ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b&96 ,  4 ) ; i97 ,  ",
    "13 ; i98 ,  ",
    "25 ) . especially in i97 (  1.2 ) , the so - called `` spin - down problem '' is defined clearly .",
    "in particular , when calculated classically , the observed spin - down time rate @xmath10 implies a spin - down power of the white dwarf ( i97 , eq . [ 1 ] ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the moment of inertia of the white dwarf in units of @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are expressed in units of @xmath10 and @xmath16 , respectively . comparing @xmath17 with the observed luminosities ( see , e.g. , i97 , table 1 ) , we realize that it exceeds the uv @xmath1 and x - ray @xmath2 luminosities of ae aqr by a factor @xmath5 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the basic postulate of the ip model concerning the accretion nature of the primary s radiation ( for details on this issue , see i95 ,  2.3 ) , and exactly this contradiction has been termed as `` spin - down problem '' .    in the following two sections , we shall discuss some scenarios proposed for solving this problem ; we shall also describe the scenario considered in the present investigation .",
    "it is of interest , at this point , to mention some models concerning the magnetic , radiating , and accreting properties of ae aqr ; although some of these models are not directly connected to the spin - down problem , they help us to have a better understanding of the whole matter . in i95 (   23 , table 1 ) , the state of the primary ( under the basic assumption that it is a white dwarf ) is taken to be simultaneously as ejector , propeller , and accretor .",
    "then the spin - down power may be lost in the form of relativistic stellar wind ejected from the surface of the white dwarf ( ejector ) or transmitted to the accretion flow near the alfvn surface ( combination of accretor and propeller ; see also eh96 ,  4.3 ) .    in k&97 (",
    " 8) , it is concluded that if the rapidly rotating white dwarf in ae aqr has a surface magnetic field of @xmath18 , then magnetic pumping is a serious candidate for the particle acceleration needed to explain the observed radio outbursts .",
    "magnetic pumping ( k&97 ,  4 and references therein ) is one of a number of stochastic particle acceleration mechanisms , known also as fermi - type mechanisms , whose essential property is the combination of a particle interaction with a spatial or temporal change in the magnetic field  which causes the particle energy to change  with a randomizing process ( see also eh96 ,  5 ) .",
    "wkh97 (   23 , 6 ) discuss in detail the so - called `` diamagnetic blob model '' ( for some related topics of interest , see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . according to the authors , the discrepancy between the large spin - down power of the white dwarf and the observed luminosity of the system is explained by the kinetic energy carried away by the ejecta .",
    "this model does also predict a magnetic dissipation time rate @xmath19 .",
    "there are some processes that may be triggered by such dissipation , but they could account for only @xmath20 percent of the dissipated energy .",
    "a significant fraction of this energy may go into particle acceleration and production of @xmath9-rays .    in i97 ,",
    "a neutron star model is proposed for the primary in ae aqr .",
    "the author concludes that , in the frame of the wind - fed accretor model , there are no particular problems with the interpretation of the observed spin - down time rate of the primary ( remember that the moment of inertia of a neutron star is @xmath21 orders of magnitude less than that of a white dwarf ) .",
    "however , this scenario reveals a very intriguing problem ( i97 ,  4 ) : if the primary in ae aqr is indeed a neutron star , why its appearance in the optical uv is very likely to that of an accreting white dwarf ?    in a subsequent investigation , ikhsanov ( i98 ,  3 ) recognizes that , in spite of some progress , the origin of the observed spin - down of the primary in ae aqr can not be regarded as well understood so far ; in this situation the investigation of alternative possibilities ( if they exist ) remains important . in this view , the author ( i98 ,  ",
    "45 ) discusses a pulsar - like white dwarf model in a binary system .",
    "in particular , he explores the possibility to solve the spin - down problem of ae aqr within the `` ejector approach '' , assuming that the major part of the rotational kinetic energy of the white dwarf is spent in the generation of low frequency magnetodipole waves and particle acceleration .",
    "as the author discusses , the main consequence of this approach is a relatively strong magnetic field of the white dwarf , which makes this model to differ radically from previous ones .",
    "the estimated magnetic moment ( @xmath22 ) is @xmath23 orders of magnitude greater than those of previous models ; and the question arising concerns the consistency of such an estimate with corresponding observations ( see i98 ,  5 for interesting details and references therein ; especially , @xcite , @xcite , b&96 ) .",
    "recently , ikhsanov ( i99 ) describes a scenario according to which `` magnetic amplification '' can be achieved by the action of differential rotation , appearing , in turn , as consequence of gravitational waves ( and resulting angular momentum loss ) ; if so , then the magnetic field inside the star winds up , on a timescale of @xmath24 , up to @xmath25 and the star spins down predominantly due to magneto - dipole waves and particle acceleration .",
    "furthermore , in the framework of the pulsar - like white dwarf model ( as in i98 , i99 ) , @xcite suggests the existence of a dead disk around the white dwarf magnetosphere . the main feature that makes the suggested model different from those previously discussed , is the hot boundary layer at the inner disk radius . due to this feature",
    ", the model sheds new light to some puzzling properties of ae aqr .",
    "@xcite , in order to explain the multiwavelength emission from ae aqr , propose a model on the basis of the assumption that the compact component of this binary system consists of a white dwarf with a surface field length of @xmath26 , rotating through a clumpy ring near the circularization radius . after a detailed analysis , they conclude that the whole reservoir of the spin - down power has gone into the production of very high - energy particles and @xmath9-ray emission .",
    "finally , @xcite point out that the electromagnetic dipole radiation with surface magnetic field @xmath27 and the propeller action with accretion time rate @xmath28 are unable to account for the observed spin - down torque .",
    "so , the authors propose that the spin - down power does not transform into the observed electromagnetic radiation and they consider the gravitational radiation emission as an alternative spin - down mechanism .",
    "the authors remark that this mechanism could be an attractive one since the resulting spin - down power does not need to go into the observed electromagnetic radiation , which effectively avoids the long standing question of nondetection of the observed large spin - down power .",
    "in the present paper , we try to resolve the spin - down problem in terms of intrinsic properties ( like angular momentum , moments of inertia , differential rotation , and magnetic field ) of the primary in ae aqr .",
    "in particular , we propose an axisymmetric , differentially rotating , magnetic , white - dwarf model with its surface magnetic field causing a slow `` secular spin - down '' ( to be distinguished from the fast spin - down observed now ) and , accordingly , a slow `` secular angular momentum loss '' .",
    "this model participates simultaneously in the accretional activities of the binary system ae aqr ; and , apparently , its secular activities are screened by its accretional activities as long as the former remain weak in comparison with the latter . under certain circumstances ,",
    "however , such secular activities can cause certain quite intense phenomena . in this view",
    ", we shall try to document the aspect that the fast spin - down of the primary in ae aqr , observed now , belongs to such a category of phenomena . in particular , we shall give numerical results showing that such fast spin - down may be the result of a nonaxisymmetric transition from an initial axisymmetric differential rotation state to a terminal nonaxisymmetric rigid rotation state , due to turn - over of the magnetic symmetry axis with respect to the invariant angular momentum axis ( the latter taken to be the @xmath29 axis ) .",
    "our results mainly show that a fast spin - down does not always imply a large spin - down power ; instead , under certain circumstances as this of turning over , the spin - down power corresponding to a large spin - down time rate ( as that observed in ae aqr ) is @xmath23 orders of magnitude less than that estimated classically .",
    "we shall use hereafter definitions and symbols identical to those in @xcite .    according to the so - called `` turn - over scenario '' ( hereafter tov scenario ) ,",
    "the model undergoes an axisymmetric `` early evolutionary phase '' , during which the combined effect of rotation and ( toroidal plus poloidal ) magnetic field derives configurations with moment of inertia along the rotation axis @xmath30 ( coinciding with the symmetry axis ) , @xmath31 , greater than the moment(s ) of inertia along the other two principal axes @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 ; i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "at some particular time , however , which signals the beginning of a `` late evolutionary phase '' , secular angular momentum loss yields configurations with @xmath36 ( relation valid for a particular angular momentum @xmath37 ) and , after that particular time , configurations with @xmath38 when @xmath39 .",
    "thus , a `` dynamical asymmetry '' is established in the sense that the moment of inertia along the rotation axis becomes less than the moment(s ) of inertia along the other two principal axes .",
    "this inequality is due to the action of toroidal magnetic field , which tends to derive prolate configurations ; while , on the other hand , rotation and poloidal magnetic field tend to derive oblate configurations .",
    "eventually , secular decrease of rotation due to surface magnetic field gives rise to dynamical asymmetry , @xmath40 .",
    "however , dynamically asymmetric configurations tend to turn over spontaneously , so that to subsequently rotate along axis with moment of inertia greater than @xmath31 .",
    "they become , therefore , `` oblique rotators '' ; the well - known `` perpendicular rotator '' is an oblique rotator with `` turn - over angle '' ( or , equivalently , `` obliquity angle '' : the angle of the magnetic symmetry axis with respect to the invariant angular momentum axis ) , @xmath41 , equal to @xmath42 .",
    "the reasons causing turn - over of dynamically asymmetric configurations have been studied by several investigators ( see , especially , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter mt72 ) ) ; details on this issue are given in  6 .    within the framework of tov scenario , we shall study the case in which the terminal nonaxisymmetric rigidly rotating model becomes perpendicular rotator on a `` turn - over timescale '' , @xmath43 , comparable with the `` period timescale '' , @xmath44 ; i.e. , @xmath45 . although any intermediate oblique model with @xmath46 undergoes a complicated rotation along axis passing through the center of mass but not coinciding with one of its principal axes ( mt72 ,  ",
    "23 ) , the terminal model rotates along its @xmath32 principal axis , which axis is now coinciding with the invariant angular momentum axis taken , in turn , to be the @xmath29 axis .",
    "apparently , its angular momentum vector remains equal to that of the starting model ( mt72 ,  ",
    "12 ) , while its angular velocity vector obtains same direction with that of the starting model ( coinciding with the angular momentum direction ) but different magnitude .    during the turn - over phase ,",
    "the turn - over angle increases spontaneously up to @xmath42 on timescale @xmath43 , since the rotational kinetic energy of the model decreases from a higher level with turn - over angle @xmath47 to a lower level with turn - over angle @xmath48 . at this level , the model reaches the state of least energy consistent with its prescribed angular momentum and magnetic field .",
    "accordingly , the excess energy due to the differential rotation field of motions , defined by the angular velocity component @xmath49 along the ( spontaneously turning over ) @xmath30 principal axis ( coinciding , in turn , with the magnetic symmetry axis ) , is dissipated down to zero under the action of turbulent viscosity in the convective regions of the model ( mt72 , ",
    "thus , differential rotation along the @xmath30 principal axis decreases down to zero and all of its effects disappear .",
    "furthermore , it seems difficult for an oblique model to sustain differential rotation along its @xmath32 principal axis mainly due to the destructive action of the poloidal magnetic field ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mmt90 ,  ",
    "13 ) ; also , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m92 ,   1 , 5 - 6 ) ) .",
    "in simple words , in a model with magnetic field symmetry axis inclined with respect to the rotation axis , i.e. , @xmath50 , nonuniform rotation in the electrically conducting stellar material shears the field and generates magnetic torques .",
    "as a result , there is a competition between the efforts of the magnetic stresses to remove rotational nonuniformities , and those of the rotational velocities to bury and destroy magnetic flux . if , then , the magnetic field and the electrical conductivity have appropriate values ( issues to be discussed in  7 ; see , e.g. , mmt90 ,  4 ; also , m92 ,  6 ) , then the magnetic field prevails and removes all the nonuniformities of rotation .",
    "consequently , the terminal model rotates rigidly along its @xmath32 principal axis with angular velocity @xmath51 .",
    "however , differential rotation behaves like a `` rotational kinetic energy capacitor '' and its decrease down to zero discharges all this excess energy ( since the rigidly rotating perpendicular rotator has a much lower `` rotational kinetic energy capacity '' ) .",
    "hence , differential rotation decrease leads to releasing the excess rotational energy on a `` differential rotation decrease timescale '' , @xmath52 , .",
    "our task here is to verify that the corresponding energy release time rate is @xmath53 times less than that estimated by equation ( [ eq : tdot ] ) .    in detail",
    ", we assume that the model of tov scenario undergoes a nonaxisymmetric transition from its axisymmetric drs to its nonaxisymmetric perpendicular rrs .",
    "the starting model has mass @xmath54 , angular momentum @xmath55 such that @xmath56 , rotational kinetic energy @xmath57 , spin period @xmath58 , magnetic perturbation parameter @xmath59 , and magnetic flux @xmath60 .",
    "the terminal model has same mass , @xmath61 , same angular momentum , @xmath62 , and same magnetic flux , @xmath63 .",
    "if so , then the fitting between the starting model and the terminal model of such a `` nonaxisymmetric drs - to - rrs transition '' ( nxdrt ) can proceed through the magnetic perturbation parameter @xmath64 of the terminal model .",
    "the equations @xmath65 @xmath66 give , for various values @xmath64 of the magnetic perturbation parameter , the corresponding angular velocity component @xmath51 along the @xmath32 principal axis ( with moment of inertia @xmath67 ; details on the calculation of this quantity are given in  5 ) and the rotational kinetic energy @xmath68 .",
    "if , furthermore , nxdrt takes place under constant magnetic perturbation parameter , @xmath69 ( which seems to be a plausible assumption ) , then the system of equations ( [ eq : lrr])([eq : trr ] ) gives the proper values for @xmath51 , @xmath68 , and the period , @xmath70 , of the terminal model .",
    "then an estimate of the timescale @xmath71 needed for the spin period to increase from the value @xmath72 to the value @xmath73 is @xmath74 and an estimate for the nxdrt power is @xmath75 in view of tov scenario , therefore , the spin - down problem is drastically simplified , since , as our numerical results reveal , the nxdrt power is @xmath53 times less than the classically estimated spin - down power of equation ( [ eq : tdot ] ) .    finally , the following remark is of interest . in order to keep computations within the two - dimensional framework of the so - called `` complex - plane iterative technique '' ( cit ) ( gp99 ,  3 and references therein )",
    ", we simulate the terminal rigidly rotating models by a constant - mass sequence of magnetic models with zero rotation ( i.e. , with rotational perturbation parameter @xmath76 ) along the @xmath30 principal axis . apparently , all the members of this nonrotating magnetic constant - mass sequence are prolate along the @xmath30 principal axis .",
    "thus , our computations retain acceptable reliability , in describing the phenomenon under consideration , as far as the component @xmath49 of @xmath77 remains small with respect to the component @xmath51 , the turn - over angle @xmath41 remains near @xmath78 , and the angle @xmath9 of the angular velocity direction with respect to the angular momentum direction remains small . for the perpendicular rotator we have @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ; thus , the perpendicular rotator can be described reliably by the simulation adopted .",
    "the axisymmetric model , initially used in tov scenario , is computed by ( the two - dimensional ) cit . in a previous investigation ( ( * ? ? ? * hereafter g91 ,  3 ) ) , cit has been developed and used for computing rotating visco - polytropic models ; this term indicates that the differential rotation of such models results from the particular equations governing the viscosity of their material .",
    "cit has been extended for computing rotating white dwarfs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gp94 ) ) , and rotating white dwarfs with toroidal magnetic field ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gp97 ) ) . recently ( gp99 )",
    ", cit has been further extended for computing rotating white dwarfs distorted by both toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "an almost complete set of quantities involved in the computations is given in gp99 ( table 1 ) .",
    "as we have already clarified , in the present paper we shall use definitions and symbols identical to those in gp99 .",
    "the algorithm of cit is analyzed in g91 (  3 ; see also gp99 , fig .",
    "the structure and the rotational behavior of the axisymmetric model is identical to that of gp94 (  2 ) .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field , @xmath82 , is defined as in gp97 (  2 , eqs .",
    "[ 2.1][2.2 ] ; see , also , gp99 , eq . [ 2.7 ] ) ; the poloidal magnetic field , @xmath83 , is defined as in gp99 (  2 , eqs .",
    "[ 2.8][2.9 ] ; @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath29 are the cylindrical coordinates ) . on the base of these definitions and , also , of the units and the corresponding dimensionless quantities defined in gp99 ( table 1 )",
    ", some straightforward algebra shows that @xmath86 \\sqrt{h } s              \\left ( \\phi^2 - \\frac{1}{y_0 ^ 2 } \\right)^\\frac{3}{2 }              { \\bf u}_{\\varphi } { \\rm , } \\ ] ] @xmath87 @xmath88 \\sqrt{\\frac{h}{\\beta_{*}^2 } }                 \\left ( - 3 s \\phi \\sqrt{\\phi^2 - \\frac{1}{y_0 ^ 2 } }                  \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\zeta } \\right ) { \\rm , } \\ ] ] @xmath89 \\sqrt{\\frac{h}{\\beta_{*}^2 } }           \\left ( 2 \\left ( \\phi^2 - \\frac{1}{y_0 ^ 2 } \\right)^\\frac{3}{2 } +           3 s \\phi \\sqrt{\\phi^2 - \\frac{1}{y_0 ^ 2 } }            \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial s } \\right ) { \\rm , } \\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the dimensionless cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath92 is the well - known white - dwarf length unit ) . for configurations declining slightly from sphericity , we can use the approximative expressions @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the dimensionless modified spherical coordinates ( taken together with the angle @xmath85 ; on the other hand , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath85 are the usual spherical coordinates ) .    the average surface poloidal magnetic field @xmath99 where the subscript @xmath100 denotes the average over this coordinate , is somewhat prescribed to the value @xmath101 by either the theory or the observations .",
    "so , there is need to define a `` surface zone '' with `` base '' at ( dimensionless ) radius @xmath102 , say . for white - dwarf models ,",
    "a common practice is to consider that the points below the boundary where electrons become degenerate  i.e. , the `` transition layer ''  are located at distance @xmath102 from the center ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter st83 ,  4.1 ) ) .",
    "so , the transition layer coincides with the base of the surface zone .",
    "the temperature at this transition layer ( which is in turn equal to the interior temperature ) , @xmath103 , is given in terms of the luminosity , @xmath104 , the mass , @xmath105 , and the composition , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , appearing either explicitly or through the quantities @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the `` mean molecular weight '' and @xmath112 the `` mean molecular weight per free electron '' , both measured in proton masses ( see , e.g. , st83 ,  2.3 ) . in particular , @xmath103 is given by the relation ( st83 , eq .",
    "[ 4.1.11 ] ) @xmath113 with corresponding density at the transition layer ( st83 , eq .",
    "[ 4.1.10 ] ) @xmath114 thus , the radius @xmath102 results as root of the nonlinear algebraic equation @xmath115 or , equivalently , @xmath116 which can be solved by a standard algorithm of numerical analysis .",
    "the fitting between the prescribed average surface poloidal magnetic field , @xmath101 , and the `` proper poloidal magnetic parameter '' , @xmath117 , can proceed through the nonlinear algebraic equation @xmath118 which , for prescribed @xmath119 , can be solved by a standard algorithm of numerical analysis and give @xmath117 as root .",
    "concerning the computation of constant - mass sequences , the white dwarf case is quite different to the polytropic case . in the polytropic case",
    ", one can construct a constant - mass sequence simply by keeping a particular fixed value for the fundamental model parameter @xmath120 , i.e. , for the polytropic index ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; also , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a constant - mass sequence of white dwarfs consists of models with properly varying fundamental model parameter @xmath121 or , equivalently , @xmath122 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the central density @xmath123 depends explicitly on @xmath121 through the well - known relation @xmath124 thus , a rotating magnetic white dwarf may attain a specific mass only for a specific combination of the fundamental model parameter @xmath121 and the rotational perturbation parameter @xmath125 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that white dwarfs with given @xmath122 may not be able to attain a specific mass at all , since there are lower and upper mass limits ; namely , the lower mass is that of a nonrotating nonmagnetic model , and the upper mass ( for given magnetic perturbation parameter @xmath119 ) is the mass of a critically rotating model .    in order to compute constant - mass sequences of white dwarfs ,",
    "we use cit in an iterative algorithm , called `` search for specific mass '' ( ssm ) .",
    "this algorithm finds the value @xmath126 for which a model with given @xmath122 and @xmath119 has a specific mass @xmath105 .",
    "alternatively , ssm can find the value @xmath127 for which a nonrotating model ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) with given @xmath122 has a specific mass @xmath105 . using ssm we can compute several constant - mass rotating sequences of white dwarfs . by calculating the angular velocity and the angular momentum of each member of a rotating sequence",
    ", we can plot the curve @xmath128 corresponding to a specific mass .",
    "however , in order to construct `` complete curves '' , we need to know the extrema of the fundamental model parameter @xmath122 , for which the sequence can still attain the specific mass .",
    "the maximum value @xmath129 corresponds to the rightmost point of the curve @xmath128 , that is , to an almost critically rotating model . a model with slightly larger",

    "can not attain the desired mass , since its lowest mass is greater than the desired one .    to calculate the extrema of @xmath122 we have developed the so - called `` search for extrema of the basic model parameter '' ( seb ) .",
    "starting from an intial guess for each extremum , this algorithm uses ssm iteratively to calculate the corresponding extrema .",
    "alternatively , seb can find the corresponding extrema of @xmath122 for a constant - mass nonrotating sequence , by properly adjusting the magnetic perturbation parameter @xmath119 .    to summarize , the computation of a rotating magnetic constant - mass sequence of white dwarfs consists of the following procedure .",
    "first , we specify certain values for the mass @xmath105 , the magnetic perturbation parameter @xmath119 , and the differential rotation reduction factor @xmath131 .",
    "alternatively , we take @xmath76  nonrotating magnetic constant - mass sequence  and we use in the fitting procedure a varying @xmath119 .",
    "second , we use seb to calculate the corresponding @xmath130 and @xmath129 .",
    "third , we use ssm to compute several models within the already specified range of values . by these results",
    "we can study the behavior of the corresponding curve @xmath128 .",
    "alternatively , we can study the full range of values @xmath132 for which a nonrotating magnetic sequence retains constant mass .",
    "the quantity @xmath67 , involved in equations ( [ eq : lrr])([eq : trr ] ) , denotes the moment of inertia of the perpendicular rotator along its rotation axis @xmath32 .",
    "the problem of calculating this moment is three - dimensional , since the equilibrium structure of the perpendicular rotator is represented by an ellipsoidal figure .",
    "thus , a systematic numerical treatment of this subject consists in developing an iterative three - dimensional method , like that of @xcite , for computing equilibrium structures distorted by both rotation and magnetic field .",
    "our plan ( for the near future ) is to modify and extend cit in order to obtain the `` three - dimensional cit '' ( 3dcit ) , able to make the job required . at present , however , 3dcit is not available .",
    "so , there is need to obtain a reliable estimate of @xmath67 by implementation of the existing `` two - dimensional cit '' ( 2dcit ) .",

    "first , the study by tt86 (  8) gives negative answer to this question , unless turbulent viscosity is also involved in the process .",
    "second , however , mmt88 (  1 , 4 ) argue that differential rotation  unless it is such that all parts of any poloidal field line have same angular velocity ( situation known as `` isorotation '' )  will produce a toroidal field from the poloidal field .",

    "the difficulty is that , on the one hand , dynamical asymmetry increases with the toroidal magnetic field ( i.e. , with the magnetic perturbation parameter @xmath119 ) and , on the other hand , efficiency in interchanging angular momentum decreases as @xmath119 increases ( that is , @xmath367 decreases as h increases ) . in view of this remark and to the extent that our problem concerns mainly the behavior of the starting model , the right title for the present section seems to be :",

    "<S> the white dwarf ( i.e. , the primary ) in the ae aqr binary star system is observed to spin down at a steady time rate @xmath0 , while at the same time its uv @xmath1 and x - ray @xmath2 accretion luminosities seem to remain almost unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this is a contradiction , however , since the classically estimated spin - down power due to decrease of rotational kinetic energy @xmath3 , @xmath4 , exceeds the accretion luminosity of the primary by a factor @xmath5 and , as a dominating power , should lead either to observable luminosity changes or to other detectable effects . </S>",
    "<S> this so - called `` spin - down problem '' can be relaxed under the assumption that the primary is now in a phase of rapidly decreasing its differential rotation under constant angular momentum , undergoing a nonaxisymmetric transition  i.e. , turning over its magnetic symmetry axis with respect to its angular momentum axis and eventually becoming a perpendicular rotator  from a `` differential rotation state '' ( drs ) to a `` rigid rotation state '' ( rrs ) on a relatively short `` nonaxisymmetric drs - to - rrs transition timescale '' . </S>",
    "<S> if so , then the estimated spin - down power , @xmath6 , becomes comparable to the observed luminosities and the spin - down problem is drastically simplified . in this paper , we present a detailed numerical study of such a `` turn - over scenario '' , which study mainly points out the fact that an observed large spin - down time rate does not always imply a large spin - down power . </S>"
