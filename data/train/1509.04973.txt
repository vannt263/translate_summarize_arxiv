    "the gel solutions are prepared according to the recipe published previously @xcite and cured in home - built glass containers ( 70 mm x 50 mm x 40 mm ) .",
    "the inner walls of the containers are grafted with a thin layer ( @xmath55 nm ) of polydimethyl siloxane chains so that the gel solution contacted the walls at 90@xmath6 to ensure that the surface of the cured gel is flat .",
    "all the experiments are performed after two hours of gelation . for the estimation of the shear modulus of the gel , we use a linear elastic model in order to ensure consistency of quantification for all the gels .",
    "the shear modulus is determined from the resonant mode of vibration of a gel slab confined between two parallel glass slides @xcite .",
    "steel spheres ( density 7.8 g / cc , diameters 1 - 10 mm ) are gently placed one by one on the gel surface and its side - view image is captured by a camera .",
    "dissipative processes within the gel dampen any oscillations , and the spheres sink until they become stagnant in the polyacrylamide gel , the whole process taking only fractions of a second .",
    "the depth of submersion , @xmath1 , is measured from the upper surface of the gel till the base of sphere , that denoting the net downward displacement due to the inclusion of the spherical particle by the surface ( fig.[fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the cells are large enough to avoid any finite boundary effects , including the side walls and the bottom .",
    "the measurement of depth for each sphere is made in the central region of the container .",
    "after each measurement , the sphere is gently removed from the gel using a magnet , held slightly away from the free surface .",
    "we wait for a few minutes between each measurement that ensures there is no memory of the position of the previous sphere inside the gel .",
    "if the bead is too small and the gel is stiff @xcite , the surface bends slightly under the weight of the bead and @xmath7 ( fig.[fig : schematic]-a ) . by increasing the bead radius or decreasing the elastic modulus ,",
    "the particle submerges itself to a considerable depth inside the gel .",
    "the surface of the gel wraps around the particle and closes to create a line singularity connecting the particle to the free surface of the gel ( fig.[fig : schematic]-b ) .",
    "strings of tiny air bubbles appear in this thin channel , which soon coalesce and escape through it while the channel further closes due to the auto - wetting forces of the gel s surface . if the surface of the gel is premarked with ink spots , it is easy to visualize that the surface of the gel becomes appreciably stretched while the sphere sinks through the gel while being still connected to the free surface via a thin channel",
    ". it is also possible to release ink inside the gel in the form of thin vertical lines with the help of a fine needle , which bend toward the sphere in a dramatic way when the sphere is released inside the gel demonstrating a substantial amount of tensile strain developed in the gel network due to the inclusion of the bead .",
    "these basic experiments were reported in a previous article @xcite , but without a detailed analysis . here",
    "we report a detailed set of experiments , in which the shear modulus of the gel was varied from 13 pa to about 3000 pa .",
    "+ prior to subjecting these experimental results to a comparison with a theoretical analysis , we needed to verify how meaningful it is to consider only the effect of elasticity by ignoring the surface tension of the gel in predicting the depth of submersion of the bead and how reversible is the deformation of the gel .",
    "first question is partly philosophical that rests upon the distinction between surface free energy @xmath8 and surface tension .",
    "the latter differs from the former by surface stress @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the surface strain . as the major constituent of these amorphous gels is water , we expect that the surface stress is negligible .",
    "in fact , several recent studies that measured surface tensions of various amorphous soft polymers strongly suggest that their surface tensions are practically same as their surface free energies @xcite .",
    "thus we need to figure out only if the surface free energies of the gels play any role .",
    "part of the answer can be obtained by comparing them with the equivalent spring constant of the sample .",
    "the latter can be obtained by slightly raising the height of the bead by an electromagnet and releasing it so that the bead undergoes an under - damped oscillation and reaches the neutral position . for three gels ,",
    "in which the beads were completely submerged , the equivalent spring constants were estimated from the frequency of oscillation to be 0.2 n / m , 5.6 n / m and 13 n / m , which increase systematically with their shear moduli ( 13 pa , 140 pa and 360 pa ) .",
    "fig.[fig : reversibility]-a shows a typical profile of such an oscillation . comparing these spring constants with the surface tension ( 0.07 n / m ) of water ,",
    "we conclude that the contribution of surface tension can be safely neglected for all the gels used in this study except , perhaps , for the lowest modulus gel for which the spring constant is three times that of the gel s surface tension .",
    "however , when a bead is completely submerged in the gel , any variation of the height of the sphere does not alter the area and the excess energy of the free surface of the gel .",
    "we thus believe that the surface tension spring does not play a significant role in determining the depth of submersion of the sphere as long as it is completely engulfed by the gel .",
    "further support to this viewpoint , i.e. the dominant role of the elasticity over surface tension was gathered from the experiment described below that also exemplified the reversibility of the softest gel ( @xmath11 13 pa ) employed in our experiments .",
    "+ by varying only the system temperature , the elastic modulus of polyacrylamide gels changes , which increases with temperature .",
    "a thin layer of paraffin oil is poured over the gel to avoid its surface from drying .",
    "the temperature of the gel is monitored by placing a thermometer inside an identical sample of gel in a similar sized container , placed inside the oven .",
    "after the gel is heated to 70 @xmath6c , a 5 mm diameter steel sphere is released into it through the layer of paraffin oil .",
    "the depth of the sphere is measured at this temperature while it is in the oven . as the gel is gradually cooled , the sphere sinks deeper inside it .",
    "we wait for an hour between acquiring data for the depth of sphere at each temperature to allow the gel to equilibrate reasonably well . after the gel",
    "is cooled to about 5 @xmath6c , it is heated again that decreases the depth of the embedded steel sphere ( heating cycle , fig.[fig : reversibility]-b ) . the depth of submersion of the sphere plotted as a function of the temperature for both the cooling and the heating cycles ( fig.[fig : reversibility]-b ) shows that there is a little hysteresis in this system , in that the difference in the depths of the sphere for a given temperature is within 5% .",
    "we conclude that the deformations of the gel generated by a bead are predominantly reversible and controlled by elastic forces .",

    "the upper white region of this inset shows the data points for beads that were completely below the surface of the gel .",
    "when we non - dimensionalize the depths as well as the radii of each bead in each gel by the material lengthscale @xmath13 defined as @xmath14(fig.[fig : data ] ) , where @xmath15 is the shear modulus of the gel , @xmath16 is the effective density of the buoyant spheres , and @xmath17 is the gravitational acceleration , we see that all the data cluster around a mean master curve with two distinctive asymptotic limits . for each sphere - gel system , @xmath16 was precisely estimated from the image on the basis of the archimedes principle of buoyancy analogous to the scenario for floatation on a liquid @xcite .",
    "the normalized data can be divided more or less into two regimes : one with the non - dimensional radii @xmath18 and other one with @xmath19 with an intermediate transition regime .",
    "we fit the non - dimensional depths as a function of the non - dimensional radii for the regime @xmath18 with the power law function @xmath20 with adjustable parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath22 and find @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the error bars are obtained from a @xmath25 confidence limit analysis .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath18 , the depths as a function of the radii follows @xmath3 within the error limits . on careful examination of the experimental points corresponding to large deformations , i.e. @xmath26 , we find that the data corresponding to the two softest gels ( @xmath27 13 pa and 25 pa ) are shifted from the rest of the data due to their multiplicative factor ( @xmath22 ) being significantly larger than the rest of the data for the other gels .",
    "this indicates that the lengthscale @xmath13 , which is defined with the elastic linear properties of the sample , is therefore not sufficient to describe the whole data accurately , and non linear effects have to be taken into account .",
    "we conclude that all the data in this regime ( @xmath19 ) can not be investigated together .",
    "it is more appropriate to investigate the data for each gel composition separately _ i.e , _ for a given non - linear material stress - strain relationship . by fitting the data for the two softest gels ( @xmath27 13 pa and 25 pa ) where all the beads are completely engulfed , with the power law function , we find that @xmath28 ( see lower inset of fig.[fig : data ] ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the exponents for the fits for the gels ( @xmath32 ) in the intermediate regime lie between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "thus , from the experimental observations , we infer that in the limit of @xmath0 significantly greater than @xmath13 , the general trend is close to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is in the range of 1.4 - 1.5 , within the error limits .",
    "thus , we conclude that the power law observed ( @xmath3 ) in the gels of higher shear moduli is closer to the regime already studied before what one would expect with an analogy with the elastic stokes equation in the hookean limit . what is astounding is the observation of @xmath37 in the case of the gels where @xmath38 for each tested bead radius . in order to interpret these novel observations in the ultra - soft gels ,",

    "from the outset , a motivating picture of the problem can be gleaned from the comparison of the potential energy of the bead in the gravitational field and the energy of the elastic deformation of the gel . in the limit of hookean deformation ,",
    "an analogy with the stokes equation suggests that the elastic energy is of the form @xmath46 , which is to be compared with the gravitational potential energy @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to the scaling : @xmath3 .",

    "the @xmath1-derivatives of @xmath179 and @xmath158 are therefore equal giving the scaling law valid for @xmath180 , for a given elastic material : @xmath181 note that the beads has been assumed to be spherical although this is not a crucial point in this theory : if it is compact with all typical lengths of the same order @xmath0 the previous scaling arguments apply .",
    "the theoretical analysis presented above provides an understanding _ sui generis _ of the experimentally observed scaling law .",
    "+ the elastic material being chosen ( so that the proportionality constant @xmath129 is fixed ) , this law predicts the scaling behaviour of the downshift of spheres with different radii and/or different densities .",
    "these predictions are in quantitative agreement with the observations : one observes experimentally a scaling law with an exponent close to @xmath161 for the radius , and the prefactor is not only related to the linear elastic properties ( @xmath15 ) , but also to non - linear features of the elastic material .",
    "these non - linear features being _ a priori _ distinct from one gel to another one , this explains why plotting @xmath182 as function of @xmath183 for different gel compositions yields to different curves .",
    "the prefactor in the scaling law depends not only on the shear modulus of the solid , but also on the elastic behaviour at large deformations , in agreement with the experiments ( @xcite ) .",
    "this provides a way to assess some characteristics of elastic materials under large strains , as strain stiffening properties . + the range of applications of the derived scaling goes far beyond the description of the elasto - buoyancy phenomenon .",
    "for instance , it can be directly checked that the recent indentation experiments performed on various types of compliant gels , by fakhouri et al @xcite , are in quantitative agreement with our prediction , however their very naive model based on the neo - hookean equation , misses the driving non - linearities .",
    "+ in this paper , we have shown that the exponent @xmath161 for the radius is independent of the strain - stress relation provided that the increase in the elastic energy density ( @xmath94 ) with the strain is stiff enough .",
    "generic behaviors for elastic materials undergoing large and complex deformations can therefore be identified , going beyond scaling arguments that is blind to the crucial effect of strain stiffening .",
    "this work sheds new light on the mechanics of extremely large elastic deformations that are crucial in various emerging techniques that even encompass an important procedure such as the computer - assisted surgery involving human organs @xcite , which are indeed non - linear materials and undergo large deformations . in all these important fields , an ideal neo - hookean model is used that , according to our current work , is not valid _ sensu stricto_. the danger is that one may miss the divergences of the solution that is inherent in the ideal neo - hookean model because the full solution is not used .",
    "the work presented here is a panacea to the possible pitfalls that one may embark upon in studying extreme deformations of non - linear materials , thereby also offering possible benchmarks for numerical simulations and even opportunities to formulate new simulations methods ."
