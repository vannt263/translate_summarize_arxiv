    "the cleanliness of the sample surfaces was first checked by the disappearance of a typical structure related to cr oxides .",
    "we could also check the degree of contamination from the magnitude of the xmcd signal , because its amplitude grew and finally saturated when the sample surface became clean enough .",
    "we considered that the unscraped or contaminated surface was covered with antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic compounds such as cr@xmath7o@xmath5 , which hardly contribute to the xmcd spectrum .",

    ". therefore one can assume that the te @xmath52 core absorption spectrum behaves like a background for the cr @xmath0 core absorption structures and the observed xas spectra in the present photon energy range mostly reflect the cr @xmath0 core absorption .",
    "however , the broad hump at 600 - 605 ev can be still assigned to the te @xmath57 absorption mainly because the observed xmcd asymmetry is negligible in this energy region .",

    ", it is found that the observed xmcd signals with opposite helicities of the incident lights are quite symmetric with respect to the zero line as shown by the solid and dashed lines .",
