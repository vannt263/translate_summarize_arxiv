    "random numbers are widely used in many applications such as cryptography , scientific simulations , and lotteries .",
    "the basic characteristics of true random numbers include unpredictability , irreproducibility and unbiasedness .",
    "most of true random number generators are based on physical systems , in which the quantum random number generator ( qrng ) is an important approach with randomness coming from the indeterministic nature of quantum physics . over the last two decades ,",
    "various qrng schemes have been proposed and implemented @xcite .",
    "for instance , a beam splitter scheme @xcite by measuring the path selection of single photons has been often used especially in the early stage of the development , and commercial qrng products based on this scheme can be found in the market such as the idq quantis that can generate a random bit rate of 4 mbps .",
    "time measurement schemes @xcite by measuring and digitizing the arrival time of single photons have been recently proposed . in such schemes ,",
    "the random bit rate can in principle be improved by multiple times compared with the beam splitter scheme , depending on the time resolution .",
    "experiments have demonstrated that the random bit rates using this scheme can reach round 100 mbps @xcite .",
    "however , in both of the above schemes , the speed is mainly limited by the count rates of single - photon detectors .    bit rate is the key parameter to characterize the performance of qrng . to significantly increase the speeds of qrngs ,",
    "new schemes have been recently proposed including vacuum state fluctuations @xcite and quantum phase fluctuations @xcite . in the scheme of quantum phase fluctuations @xcite ,",
    "conventional photodetectors rather than single - photon detectors are used to measure quantum effects .",
    "the photons coming from a laser originate from two mechanisms , i.e. , stimulated emission and spontaneous emission . in the standard quantum optics model , photons from stimulated emission are normally assumed to have fixed phases , whereas photons from spontaneous emission have random phases .",
    "thus , the total phase of photons emitted from the laser always fluctuates over time .",
    "when the laser is operated around its threshold level , the ratio between spontaneous and stimulated emissions could be high enough for measurement , which implies that quantum noise may dominate the phase fluctuations in this scenario . once phase fluctuations are converted into intensity fluctuations",
    ", the quantum phase noise can be easily measured using classical photodetectors and hence quantum randomness is generated .",
    "since photodetectors are much faster than single - photon detectors , bit rates of qrngs by measuring quantum phase fluctuations could be considerably high . recently",
    ", the toronto group have experimentally demonstrated qrngs with bit rates of 500 mbps @xcite and 6 gbps @xcite using the scheme of quantum phase fluctuations .",
    "however , these rates are still not high enough for some applications .",
    "for instance , given a 10 ghz clocked quantum key distribution ( qkd ) system @xcite , it requires roughly a 40 gbps random bit stream .",
    "hence , developing a high - speed and low - cost qrng for such qkd system is highly required .    in this paper",
    ", we report a 68 gbps qrng based on the scheme of quantum phase fluctuations .",
    "the key device in our qrng system is an actively stabilized interferometer .",
    "one output port of the interferometer is monitored by an optical power meter , which sends feedback signals in real - time to precisely tune a phase shifter in one arm of the interferometer . in this way ,",
    "the interferometer can be stable even without temperature control .",
    "the phase fluctuations of photons are converted into intensity fluctuations , which are then measured with a high - speed photodetector .",
    "the voltage amplitudes of the photodetector are digitalized as raw random data with a maximum sampling frequency of 10 ghz , which is higher than previous implementation with one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we then develop a model for our qrng system to evaluate the min - entropy of the raw random data , and apply toeplitz - matrix hashing for randomness extraction @xcite .",
    "after post - processing , all the random bit streams can well pass the standard randomness tests .",
    "phase fluctuations , or phase noise in the frequency domain , of photons emitted from a laser originate from spontaneous emissions and are random in nature , which can be used as a quantum random source .",
    "most importantly , phase fluctuations are measurable via an interferometer by converting phase into intensity .",
    "however , quantum phase fluctuations are often mixed with classical noise . to make the readout easier",
    ", the ratio between quantum noise and classical noise should be as high as possible . in this experiment ,",
    "when the laser is operated at the threshold level quantum noise will be dominant .",
    "after modeling and quantifying the contribution of quantum noise , quantum random bits are finally generated .",
    "+    the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "a 1550 nm laser diode is driven by constant current with thermoelectric cooling control . the continuous wavelength ( cw ) laser is operated slightly above its threshold .",
    "photons emitted from the laser enter a homemade michelson interferometer .",
    "the interferometer consists of a 3-port circulator , a 50/50 beam splitter ( bs ) , a phase shifter ( ps ) and two faraday rotator mirrors ( frms ) .",
    "the time delay of about 3.735 ns between the two arms of the interferometer is much smaller than the coherence time of laser .",
    "with such a configuration , two frms can effectively remove polarization effects , which makes the interferometer polarization - insensitive .",
    "the interferometer has two output ports , i.e. , out1 and out2 , as shown in fig .",
    "out1 is monitored by an optical power meter ( pm ) .",
    "the measured results of the pm are uploaded to a computer , in which a proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) algorithm is implemented .",
    "the pid program sends feedback signals to an open - loop piezo controller ( pc , thorlabs mdt694b ) to precisely tune the ps in real - time .",
    "in such a way , phase stabilization in the interferometer could maintain at a high level and conventional temperature control for the interferometer is not required any more .",
    "[ fig1]b shows a typical measurement result of optical power at out1 over 20 minutes . the nearly straight line in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b indicates that the interferometer itself is stable and slight fluctuations could be regarded as classical noise .",
    "out2 is detected by a 15 ghz photodetector ( pd , eot et3500f ) .",
    "the voltage output of the pd is sampled by an 8-bit analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) in a 12 ghz oscilloscope ( agilent dsa91204a ) and raw data are generated . due to the memory limit in the oscilloscope ,",
    "20.5 mpoints or 164 mbits are acquired each time to form one raw data file . for a sampling rate of 10 gsa",
    "/ s , the corresponding data acquisition period is 2.05 ms . the raw data is then transferred to a computer for post - processing .",

    "[ fig1]a , the ps in the interferometer is constantly tuned such that @xmath7 is @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is an integer ) .",
    "since @xmath10 is small , we have @xmath11 therefore , the phase fluctuation of the laser source can be measured directly by the intensity of the interferometer output .",
    "in addition to the signals from phase fluctuations , the variance of the photodetector output also contains background noise , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the linear response constant between the optical input signal and the photodetector voltage output .",
    "meanwhile , as discussed previously the total phase fluctuations can be divided into signals from quantum fluctuations ( q / p ) and classical ones ( c ) @xcite , @xmath14 finally , there are three contributions to the measured intensity variance , @xmath15 in practice , by changing the laser power @xmath16 , the parameters of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 can be estimated via data fitting . here , @xmath20 is the quantum signal of interest that should be maximized , compared with the classical counterpart @xmath21 . with randomness extraction ,",
    "one can remove the correlation between classical noise and the final random bits .",
    "the amplitude variances of the pd output are measured by precisely tuning the ld power from minimum to 10 mw .",
    "the pd output is sampled by a high - speed oscilloscope with different sampling rates .",
    "the time delay of the interferometer and the sampling time interval are two free variables that appear in the min - entropy evaluation model @xcite .",
    "taking into account that the bandwidths of pd and adc are 15 ghz and 12 ghz , respectively , the maximum sampling rate in the experiment is chosen as 10 gsa / s .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the signal variance responses to the laser power with four different sampling rates are highly consistent , where the minor differences are caused by the access noise of the measurement , such as the bandwidth and resolution of the oscilloscope .",
    "the measured values are then fitted , according to eq .  , to obtain the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
