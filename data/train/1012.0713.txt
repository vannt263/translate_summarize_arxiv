    "in a recent series of papers @xcite it was shown that the principal part of the dirac hamiltonian in 3 + 1 dimensions emerges naturally from a construction of quantum gravity in a semi - classical limit . in this paper",
    "we resolve some important details which were left open in @xcite .",
    "the construction from which the dirac hamiltonian emerges is a spectral triple over a configuration space of connections @xcite . via ashtekar variables @xcite this configuration space",
    "is related to gravity . since a spectral triple is the basic ingredient in a noncommutative geometry this construction represents a metric construction over a space of connections .",
    "more specifically , the triple involves an algebra of holonomy loops represented as bounded operators on a separable hilbert space on which a dirac type operator acts .",
    "the latter resembles a functional derivation operator .",
    "the spectral triple is constructed on a projective system of ordered cubic lattices .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the interaction between the algebra of holonomy loops and the dirac type operator reproduces the structure of the poisson bracket of general relativity when formulated in terms of ashtekar variables .",
    "this means that the spectral triple construction encodes the kinematics of quantum gravity .",
    "then , in @xcite , certain semi - classical states were constructed on which the principal part of the dirac hamiltonian in 3 + 1 dimensions emerges from the expectation value of the abstract dirac type operator . however , in @xcite no explanation as to why the semi - classical states had their particular form was found .",
    "this question was addressed in @xcite where a somewhat modified set of semi - classical states were found .",
    "these states have the particular property that they evade a certain dependency on a basepoint which turns up in the algebra of holonomy loops .",
    "these new states lead , however , to a classical expression which only formally equals the dirac hamiltonian .    in this short paper",
    "we show that a minor modification of the argumentation in @xcite does lead to the emergence of the principal part of the dirac hamiltonian in a semiclassical limit . + the paper is organized as follows : sections 2 - 5 give a review of known results . in section 2",
    "we introduce a noncommutative @xmath6-algebra of holonomy loops and a spectral triple construction over this algebra .",
    "the underlying space is an infinite dimensional space of generalized connections and the construction is based on an infinite system of nested lattices . in section 3",
    "we link this construction to canonical quantum gravity in the sense that the spectral triple construction captures the kinematics of quantum gravity .",
    "section 4 is concerned with the construction of states which in a certain sense smear the basepoint , at which the product between loops in the algebra is defined , over the infinite lattice .",
    "these states are then combined with coherent states , which we introduce in section 5 , to form semiclassical states which , in section 6 , are shown to give a dirac operator in 3 dimensions in a semiclassical limit . in section 7",
    "we show that a minor generalization of these states entail the principal part of the dirac hamiltonian in 3 + 1 dimensions in the same semi - classical limit .",
    "let @xmath7 be an ordered system of 3-dimensional , finite , cubic , oriented lattices where @xmath8 is the symmetric subdivision of @xmath9 as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "these lattices can be viewed either as abstract combinatorial graphs or , as we will do in the subsequent sections , in terms of a cubulation of a compact 3-manifold @xmath10 .",
    "consider first a single lattice @xmath11 in @xmath12 .",
    "denote by @xmath13 and @xmath14 the vertices and edges in @xmath11 where @xmath15 should be understood as a map @xmath16 which connects adjacent vertices @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 in @xmath11 . denote by @xmath19 the reversed edge .",
    "let @xmath20 be a compact lie - group and let @xmath21 be a map which assigns an element in @xmath20 to each edge @xmath15 @xmath22 satisfying @xmath23 denote by @xmath24 the space of such maps .",
    "note that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of edges in @xmath11 . choose a vertex @xmath27 in @xmath11 which is called the basepoint .",
    "a sequence of edges @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is called a loop ( based in @xmath27 ) and a product between two loops @xmath30 and @xmath31 is given by gluing them at the basepoint @xmath27 @xmath32 two loops are considered equal if they differ by a trivial backtracking @xmath33 and an involution of a loop @xmath34 is given by its reversal @xmath35 which satisfies @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this set of loops in @xmath11 form a group .",
    "consider now formal , finite series of loops in @xmath11 @xmath38 with the obvious product and involution .",
    "these formal series form a @xmath6-algebra , which we denote by @xmath39 , and which has a natural norm given by @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the matrix norm in @xmath20 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 . the algebra @xmath39 is naturally represented as bounded operators in the hilbert space @xmath44 where @xmath45 is with respect to the haar measure on @xmath20 and where @xmath46 is the size of a matrix representation of @xmath20 , by @xmath47 here @xmath48 acts by matrix multiplication on the factor @xmath49 .",
    "notice that this representation of @xmath39 need not be faithful .",
    "the spectral triple construction presented here works for a general compact lie group @xcite .",
    "however , we shall in the following assume that @xmath50 and choose its fundamental representation , i.e. m=2 .",
    "let us now return to the full system of graphs @xmath12 . with the above construction we have to each graph @xmath8 in @xmath12 an associated space @xmath51 and an algebra @xmath52 represented in a hilbert space @xmath53 of states over @xmath51 .",
    "we take the appropriate projective and inductive limits @xmath54 thus , the algebra @xmath55 is generated by loops running in the infinite lattice @xmath12 represented as bounded operators on the separable hilbert space @xmath56 . to obtain a spectral triple construction over @xmath57",
    "we need to construct a dirac type operator @xmath58 which interacts with the algebra @xmath55 .",
    "it turns out that the construction of such an operator requires some work .",
    "the key issue is to ensure that the dirac type operator , which is a composition of dirac type operators @xmath59 acting in the intermediate hilbert spaces @xmath60 , is compatible with projections between spaces @xmath61 and @xmath62 and corresponding embeddings between hilbert spaces @xmath60 and @xmath63 .",
    "this requirement is non - trivial and restricts the choice of @xmath58 .",
    "here we shall simply state the result and refer to @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "consider again the level of the single graph @xmath8 which is obtained by @xmath64 subdivisions of the first lattice .",
    "let @xmath65 be the hilbert space @xmath66 which is obtained from @xmath67 by adding the clifford bundle @xmath68 .",
    "this step requires a choice of a left and right invariant metric on @xmath20 . again , take the inductive limit to obtain @xmath69 next , choose an orthonormal basis @xmath70 of the lie algebra of the @xmath71th copy of @xmath20 in @xmath51 and denote by @xmath72 the corresponding left - invariant vector fields .",
    "denote by @xmath73 the corresponding elements in the clifford algebra .",
    "consider the operator @xmath74 where @xmath75 means clifford multiplication and where @xmath76 are real parameters . in ( [ d ] )",
    "the sum runs over all the copies of @xmath20 assigned to edges in @xmath11 .",
    "however , this assignment of copies of @xmath20 now differs from what is described above and corresponds to a particular change of variables in @xmath51 . for details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath77 are compatible with embeddings of hilbert spaces and thus entails a consistent operator @xmath58 acting on the limiting hilbert space @xmath78 .",
    "it turns out that the triple @xmath79 satisfies the requirements of a _ semi - finite spectral triple _ whenever the infinite sequence @xmath80 approaches infinity @xcite . to have a spectral triple",
    "means that @xmath81 the resolvent @xmath82 is compact and @xmath83 that the commutator of @xmath58 with an element in the algebra is bounded .",
    "semi - finite _ spectral triple means that the first requirement is satisfied up to a trace , which means that a certain infinite degeneracy in the spectrum of @xmath58 is integrated out .",
    "here , this degeneracy comes from the action of the infinite dimensional clifford algebra acting in @xmath78 . for details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we now turn to ashtekars formulation of general relativity in terms of connections @xcite .",
    "this formulation takes its outset in the adm formulation and is thus based on a foliation of space - time in terms of a family of space - like 3-manifolds @xmath84 .",
    "the ashtekar variables consist connection .",
    "the real case corresponds either to the euclidean setup or to a formulation where the constraints have a more complicated form .",
    "here we shall ignore this important issue and stick with the real connection .",
    "] of a @xmath85 connection @xmath86 and a densitized frame field @xmath87 .",
    "these variables come with a poisson bracket @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the gravitational constant .",
    "in addition to this there is a set of three constraints , the hamilton , diffeomorphism and gauss constraints .",
    "consider now an alternative set of variables which are dual to the ashtekar variables .",
    "we trade the connection @xmath90 for holonomy transforms @xmath91 of the connection along curves @xmath92 in @xmath84 and we trade the frame field @xmath93 for fluxes @xmath94 of the frame field through surfaces @xmath95 in @xmath84 .",
    "the poisson bracket of these alternative variables reads @xmath96 where the curve @xmath92 is composed of @xmath97 and @xmath98 which ends and begins , respectively , at the surface @xmath95 .",
    "the bracket vanishes if @xmath95 fails to intersect @xmath92 and the sign of the bracket is determined by the orientation of @xmath95 relative to @xmath92 .",
    "these loop and flux variables play a pivotal role in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that the interaction between the dirac type operator @xmath58 and the algebra @xmath55 quantizes the bracket ( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "this means that the algebra @xmath55 can be interpreted as an algebra of holonomy loop operators , and that the left invariant vector fields @xmath99 in @xmath58 can be interpreted as flux operators corresponding to infinitesimal surfaces sitting at the endpoints of the edges @xmath15 .",
    "we shall return to this point in section 5 .",
    "furthermore , if we view the lattices in @xmath12 as embedded in a 3-manifold @xmath10 , and consider the space of smooth @xmath85 connections is a space of connections in a trivial bundle over @xmath10 . ] on @xmath10 , then one can show that @xcite @xmath100 which means that the completion @xmath57 separates the configuration space @xmath101 of connections .",
    "this result mirrors a key result in loop quantum gravity based on a system of piece - wise analytic graphs in @xmath84 ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "thus , these results show that the spectral triple @xmath102 carries information which captures the kinematics of quantum gravity .",
    "the algebra @xmath55 comes with a dependency on the basepoint @xmath103 .",
    "had we instead chosen to work with a commutative algebra of traced holonomy loops this dependency would not show up . to see this",
    "consider first two different basepoints @xmath27 and @xmath104 and two corresponding algebras @xmath105 and @xmath106 associated to these basepoints .",
    "the relationship between @xmath105 and @xmath106 is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a path in @xmath8 which connects @xmath27 and @xmath104 .",
    "if we take the trace in ( [ backback ] ) the conjugation with @xmath109 vanishes due to the cyclicity of the trace and thus the traced algebra is independent on the choice of basepoint .    in the following",
    "we will identify states in @xmath65 which show a certain degree of independency on the choice of basepoint . to introduce these states consider first the commutator between @xmath77 and @xmath110 , which we calculate to @xmath111 = \\sum_a    a_i   { \\bf e}_i^a g_i \\sigma^a = : -   a_i \\mathrm{i } \\sqrt{3 } v_i\\;. \\label{commu}\\ ] ] notice that the operator @xmath112 is not unitary . to obtain a unitary operator we add an extra term to @xmath112 @xmath113 and check that @xmath114 . given an element @xmath115 we compute @xmath116 where we write @xmath117 and where @xmath118 denotes the trace over the clifford algebra .",
    "thus , conjugating with either @xmath112 and @xmath119 singles out the trace of @xmath34 . in the first case",
    "the non - tracial part is suppressed with a factor @xmath120 , in the second case the non - tracial part of @xmath34 is absent altogether .",
    "next , let again @xmath121 be a path in @xmath8 and define two associated operators by @xmath122 both @xmath123 and @xmath124 are easily seen to form two families of mutually orthogonal operators labelled by paths in @xmath8 @xmath125 due to the presence of the clifford algebra elements in @xmath123 and @xmath124 . here",
    "@xmath126 equals one when the paths @xmath127 and @xmath128 are identical and zero otherwise .",
    "consider now states in @xmath65 of the form @xmath129 where the sum runs over vertices @xmath130 in @xmath131 where a path @xmath132 connects the basepoint @xmath27 with a vertex @xmath130 .",
    "also , @xmath133 denotes an element in @xmath134 associated to the vertex @xmath130 .",
    "later , upon taking a certain continuum limit , @xmath133 will be seen to represent a ( weyl ) spinor degree of freedom at the point @xmath130 .",
    "@xmath135 is a state in @xmath65 which does not depend on the choice of basepoint @xmath27 in the sense that the expectation value of an element @xmath34 in @xmath52 on this state will depend only on the trace of @xmath34 @xmath136    the states ( [ sss ] ) may alternatively be constructed using the operators @xmath123 . in this case the non - tracial part of the expectation value of the algebra will only vanish upon taking the continuum limit which will be introduced in the following .",
    "however , the main results of this paper concerning the dirac hamiltonian holds also for such alternative states .",
    "before we proceed we recall the results for coherent states on compact connected lie groups that we are going to use . for simplicity",
    "we will only consider various copies of @xmath85 .",
    "this construction uses results of hall @xcite , and is inspired by the articles @xcite .",
    "first pick a point @xmath137 in the phase space of ashtekar variables on a 3-manifold @xmath10 .",
    "the states which we construct will be coherent states peaked over this point .",
    "consider first a single edge @xmath138 and thus one copy of @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath139 be a basis for @xmath140 .",
    "there exist families @xmath141 such that @xmath142 and @xmath143 where @xmath144 , and @xmath145 denotes the inner product hereon ; @xmath146 denotes the right endpoint of @xmath138 , and the index `` @xmath46 '' in the @xmath147 refers to the direction of @xmath138 .",
    "the factor @xmath148 is due to the fact that @xmath99 corresponds to a flux operator with a surface determined by the lattice @xcite .",
    "corresponding statements hold for operators of the type @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a polynomial in three variables , and @xmath151 is a smooth function on @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath152 the states @xmath153 have further important physical properties which we are however not going to use at the present stage of the analysis . also , the precise construction of these states , in particular the choice of complexifier @xcite , is irrelevant for the results presented in this paper .",
    "let us now consider the graph @xmath8 .",
    "we split the edges into @xmath154 , and @xmath155 , where @xmath156 denotes the edges appearing in the @xmath64th subdivision but not in the @xmath157th subdivision , and @xmath158 the rest .",
    "let @xmath153 be the coherent state on @xmath85 defined above and define the states @xmath159 by @xmath160 and @xmath161 finally define @xmath162 to be the product of all these states as a state in @xmath163 .",
    "these states are essentially identical to the states constructed in @xcite except that they are based on cubic lattices and a particular mode of subdivision .    in the limit @xmath164 these states produce the right expectation value on all loop operators in the infinite lattice .",
    "the purpose of this and the subsequent section is to analyse a semi - classical approximation of the spectral triple construction ( [ spec ] ) .",
    "we will show that the expectation value of @xmath58 on the particular states constructed in section 4 gives , in a certain limit , the dirac operator in 3 dimensions and , with a certain modification , the dirac hamiltonian in @xmath165 dimensions .",
    "consider first the states @xmath166 composed by the states ( [ sss ] ) and the coherent states introduced in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , we will restrict the series @xmath80 of parameters in @xmath58 : we now require all @xmath76 s associated to edges appearing in the @xmath167th subdivision but not in the @xmath168th subdivision to be equal . with this restriction",
    "the parameters @xmath76 represent a scaling degree of freedom .",
    "we find @xmath169 where @xmath130 and @xmath170 denote start and endpoint of an edge @xmath138 and where the sum runs over edges appearing in the @xmath64th but not in the @xmath157th subdivision .",
    "expand @xmath171 according to @xmath172 where `` @xmath46 '' is again the direction of the edge @xmath138 .",
    "this expansion is permitted whenever we apply the coherent states and take the continuum limit @xmath164 together with the semi - classical limit @xmath173",
    ". then equation ( [ hmmmmm ] ) gives @xmath174 where we set @xmath175 and write @xmath176 .",
    "crucially , obtaining ( [ hmmm ] ) requires that we fix the free parameters @xmath177 to @xmath178 .",
    "thus , the expectation value of the dirac type operator @xmath58 on the states ( [ dadada ] ) renders , in a combination of a semi - classical limit and a continuum limit , the expectation value of an ordinary dirac operator on a manifold @xmath10 .",
    "the expression ( [ hmmm ] ) is formulated with respect to a certain coordinate system which emerges from the graphs @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the cubic lattices in @xmath12 can , in this specific limit , be interpreted as an emergent coordinate system . in particular",
    ", this coordinate system is exactly the coordinate system in which the classical ashtekar variables are formulated .",
    "notice that in order to obtain expression ( [ hmmm ] ) we had to fix the parameter @xmath179 .",
    "thus , the freedom which we encountered when we constructed the dirac type operator @xmath58 is eliminated in order to obtain a sensible semi - classical limit .",
    "notice also that @xmath147 is the densitized dreibein @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the dreibein and @xmath182 is the determinant of the 3-metric @xmath182 given by the dreibein .",
    "this means that the inverse measure @xmath183 arises naturally in ( [ hmmm ] ) .",
    "the states ( [ sss ] ) and ( [ dadada ] ) are not the most general states on which the action of the algebra @xmath184 is independent of the basepoint . in this section",
    "we show that generalizations of ( [ sss ] ) which still satisfy ( [ indy ] ) lead naturally to the dirac hamiltonian in @xmath165 dimensions .",
    "consider the modified operators @xmath185 where @xmath186 is an arbitrary , self - adjoint two - by - two matrix associated to the edge @xmath138 . following the recipe of section 4 we",
    "first construct the corresponding operators @xmath187 as well as the corresponding states @xmath188 one finds that the expectation value of @xmath58 on these modified states gives @xmath189 where we wrote @xmath186 as @xmath190 with @xmath191 referring to the point which @xmath138 singles out in this limit . here , @xmath192 and @xmath193 are seen to give the lapse and shift fields . in ( [ hmmmdi ] )",
    "we have omitted certain zero - order terms .",
    "equation ( [ hmmmdi ] ) is thus seen to equal the principal part of the dirac hamiltonian in @xmath165 dimensions .",
    "thus , the states ( [ nichols ] ) can be interpreted as one - particle states on which the dirac type operator @xmath58 gives the hamiltonian in the semi - classical approximation .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this interpretation .",
    "the result ( [ hmmmdi ] ) holds only if the matrices @xmath186 are unitary , which means that the lapse and shift fields are normalized as a 4-vector .",
    "it is possible to introduce the lapse and shift fields in a different manner .",
    "for instance , they might emerge from a polar decomposition of an element in @xmath194 which in turn could come from a construction which operates with two copies of @xmath85 assigned to each edge .",
    "this option would not put any restrictions on the lapse and shift fields .",
    "alternatively , in @xcite we suggest a different construction involving a generalized dirac type operator . which construction is better",
    "must be determined through a deeper understanding of the spectral triple construction .",
    "notice , that the coherent states @xmath162 are , in the limit where @xmath64 approaches infinity , no longer states in the hilbert space @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , in this limit combined with the semiclassical approximation , an action of the diffeomorphism group , which is clearly absent at the level of a finite graph , emerges .",
    "thus , one may speculate what structure these coherent states generate and whether this structure carries an action of the diffeomorphism group .",
    "we suspect that this might be the true object of interest here and that the lattices simply serve as an intermediate step towards a continuum construction .    finally",
    ", having now established the existence of one - particle states it should be determined whether the hilbert space @xmath78 also involves many - particle states .",
