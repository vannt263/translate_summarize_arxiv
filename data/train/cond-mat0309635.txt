    "the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in disordered systems @xcite is a complex problem , complete and accurate treatment of which requires that the effects of localization and the electronic correlations be taken into account simultaneously and on equal footing .",
    "the main difficulty in constructing such a model lies in the fact that near the mit strong coulomb interactions can not be treated perturbatively and thus render single - particle models unrealistic .",
    "carriers that are localized by the disordered potential can not screen the coulomb interactions as well as the mobile ones , therefore in disordered systems the  correlations play an important role and must be included in the picture of the mit .    far from the transition , theoretical models have successfully described the effects due to the interactions in the conductivity @xmath8 and density of states ( dos ) @xmath3 .",
    "the transport conductivity of a metallic material with strong coulomb correlations as a function of temperature follows a power law : @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite on the insulating side , the interactions modify the exponent of the temperature dependence of the variable range hopping ( vrh ) conductivity from @xmath11 in the noninteracting case @xcite to @xmath12 : @xmath13 . @xcite in the density of states , on either side of the mit , interactions generally cause the depletion of states near the fermi energy . in  the metallic regime",
    "the correlations are manifested as a  square - root dip in the dos : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the correlation energy , @xmath16 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath17 is the mean free path , and @xmath18 is planck s constant .",
    "@xcite in an insulator with thermally activated variable range hopping conductivity , the interactions lead to the  opening of a  soft gap with a quadratic ( in 3d case ) energy dependence , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the dielectric constant and @xmath21 is the electronic charge .",
    "the width of the coulomb gap @xcite @xmath22 is determined by @xmath20 and the noninteracting density of states @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "the presence of the features due to the coulomb interactions in the conductivity and the dos of disordered systems near the mit has been well established experimentally . the usual way to investigate",
    "the transition is to study a set of samples with different dopant concentrations near the critical one .",
    "@xcite in these samples one can measure the transport conductivity and in some cases , the tunneling conductance , which is believed to be approximately proportional to the dos . features described above , such as vrh with @xmath12 exponent , the coulomb gap in the dos on the insulating side , the square root of t conductivity dependence and the square root cusp in the dos have been observed in various experiments performed on crystalline @xcite and amorphous samples .",
    "@xcite    amorphous systems have an advantage over the crystalline materials for the mit studies , since they undergo the transition at doping concentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than the crystalline materials ( roughly @xmath25 versus @xmath26 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the fermi temperature @xmath27 of amorphous systems is much higher than in the crystalline ones , and @xmath28 is much lower .",
    "while it becomes inappropriate to think in terms of single particles , it is convenient to use the terminology to identify the conditions where these correlation effects dominate . for amorphous systems the region where the ioffe - regel localization criterion @xcite @xmath29 is valid ( here @xmath30 is the fermi wave vector )",
    "is significantly expanded , and the maximum critical conductivity @xmath31 ) , where @xmath32 is the concentration , can reach @xmath33  ( @xmath34cm)@xmath35 at @xmath36 @xmath37 , as opposed to @xmath38  ( @xmath34cm)@xmath35 in the crystalline doped semiconductors .",
    "@xcite therefore , in amorphous materials one can probe the transition much deeper in the critical regime at accessible temperatures .    in some materials it is possible to observe the mit in a  single sample and tune it by varying an external parameter , such as magnetic field , @xcite stress , @xcite or illumination .",
    "@xcite this approach is preferable to studying multiple samples , because it eliminates the undesirable scatter in the sample parameters , inevitable when using a discrete set of samples .",
    "for this reason , magnetically doped amorphous materials , such as @xmath0-gd@xmath1si@xmath2 ( gdsi ) and tb@xmath1si@xmath2 , @xcite are particularly suited for the studies of the mit . in these materials besides the structural disorder , there is an additional degree of disorder associated with random orientation of the ionic magnetic moments , which can be controlled by the magnetic field .",
    "when the magnetic moments of the impurity ions are aligned by the external field , the disorder in the system is reduced , and the mobility edge @xmath39 is lowered .",
    "@xcite this promotes delocalization of carriers and increases the conductivity of the material .",
    "therefore a single sample with the concentration slightly below critical and thus insulating can be continuously driven through the mit into the metallic state by an external magnetic field .",
    "it is also possible to probe the density of states ( dos ) simultaneously with the transport properties of these materials by studying the tunneling of quasiparticles through a thin oxide barrier between the material in question and a metallic electrode .",
    "these experiments enable one to track the changes that occur in the dos at the transition and to separate them from the mobility effects , which both contribute to the conductivity .",
    "insulating and metallic behavior can be defined as follows .",
    "the sample is an insulator , if its conductivity @xmath40 extrapolated to zero temperature vanishes : @xmath41 . if @xmath42 is finite , the sample is on the metallic side of the transition . in gdsi",
    "the mit occurs at @xmath43 of gd in zero magnetic field .",
    "near this critical doping value , @xmath42 is very sensitive to the slight variations of @xmath44 .",
    "a sample doped slightly below the critical level at low temperature shows a large positive magnetoconductivity and can be continuously driven through the transition by the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite near the mit the amorphous gdsi has been extensively studied : its structure , @xcite transport conductivity , @xcite tunneling conductance , @xcite specific heat , @xcite magnetization , @xcite infrared absorption , @xcite spin polarization , @xcite and the hall effect , @xcite have been investigated in detail . it has been shown that the magnetic field plays a role similar to increasing the gd concentration @xmath44 and increases the conductivity while raising both the free carrier concentration and the density of states , which appear to grow towards the metallic side in a coordinated way . @xcite in further work the density of free carriers has been found to vary linearly with magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    the results of tunneling measurements @xcite indicate that deep in the metallic regime , yet at @xmath45 still below the ioffe - regel condition , the dos of gdsi has @xmath46 dependence with a non - vanishing @xmath47 .",
    "tunneling conductance curves @xmath48 at different constant magnetic fields are approximately parallel to each other with only @xmath47 increasing with field . on the insulating side",
    "these experiments are limited by the increasing resistance of the gdsi film .",
    "when the resistance of the insulating gdsi film over the area of the tunnel junction becomes comparable with the resistance of the junction itself , the voltage drop occurs both over the junction and the film , so that the bias voltage can not be considered a true energy coordinate . in samples which become conducting in magnetic field , the dos shows a soft gap near zero bias with somewhat weaker than @xmath49 dependence and @xmath47 vanishing at low fields .",
    "the tunneling data also suggest that in the transition region the dos evolves continuously from insulating , showing a soft gap at zero bias , to metallic , with a square root cusp , upon increasing magnetic field . near the mit",
    "the dos at the fermi level @xmath47 has been shown to depend on magnetic field as @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite the models for the dos described above that are valid far from the transition , can not be applied in the critical region and can not be properly merged at the critical concentration .",
    "it is not known how the dos evolves from the insulating form to the metallic one .",
    "it  is therefore highly desirable to be able to tune a single sample through the mit and measure its transport and tunneling properties as close to the transition as possible .",

    "the bias voltage , at which the inflection occurs , decreases with increasing field , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : secderiv ] .    the significance of these data , we believe , is the indication that the crossover from metallic @xmath91 behavior to insulating @xmath110 behavior is continuous and we can not identify from the tunneling data a `` critical point '' that marks the transition .",
    "we emphasize that this study probes the sample very close to the mit with high resolution .",
    "this is achieved for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the transition is continuously tuned with applied field , and secondly , the region of study is well below the ioffe - regel condition . we have observed similar behavior in the tunneling characteristics of all samples studied to date in the vicinity of the mit .",
    "in fact , the @xmath48 data at different fields for different samples can be scaled to form one `` master set '' of curves , progressively changing their shape from insulating to metallic , correlated with the sample conductivity .",
    "the results of the tunneling experiments can be summarized as follows .",
    "the dos evolves gradually and continuously with increasing magnetic field from an insulating to a metallic shape .",
    "the coulomb correlation gap , associated with the insulating behavior , shrinks as the field increases . at these fields , transport experiments on the sample",
    "already show metallic transport conductivity .",
    "zero bias tunneling conductance grows as a strong ( quadratic ) function of the applied field . for samples very close to the transition",
    ", one can observe a situation , where the tunneling conductance is vanishingly small , and the transport conductivity is already appreciable .",
    "this is a result we did not expect , as we anticipated that @xmath3 and @xmath45 would vanish together at the transition .",
    "we conclude that the effects in the density of states @xmath3 that are associated with the insulating regime persist well into the metallic regime .",
    "observation of a measurable metallic conductivity simultaneously with an apparent absence of the extended states at the fermi level appears paradoxical at first sight .",
    "nevertheless , a situation where this is possible can be easily pictured .",
    "consider a strongly disordered system approaching the mit from an insulating side .",
    "when at the transition a small fraction of all carriers becomes delocalized , the current may flow via a very small number of conduction paths among the disordered sites .",
    "conductivity due to these paths is much higher than that due to the rest of the carriers , which are still localized and participate in transport by the thermally activated variable - range hopping . at low temperature",
    "the contribution of the localized carriers to the conductivity is exponentially small compared to the contribution of the extended states , despite the fact that the former constitute an overwhelming majority among all carriers .",
    "the overall conductivity therefore will be determined by the few , high mobility extended carriers . on the other hand , the dos that is observed in an experiment , such as ours , reflects an average number among all microscopic states in the sample at a given energy , thus its magnitude will be determined by the dominating species . near the transition",
    "a small number of carriers possess a metallic dos with @xmath115 and @xmath116 , however a vast majority of states still show an insulating type of dos with a parabolic energy dependence and a vanishing @xmath47 . when summed over all microscopic states with appropriate weights proportional to the numbers of each species , the contribution to the dos of the localized states overwhelmingly prevails over that of the metallic ones , and as a result , at the transition the total dos appears to be insulating . in this case the dos at @xmath117 at the mit is likely to vanish .",
    "as the sample is driven towards the metallic regime and the number of the extended carriers grows , the dos acquires an intermediate shape , i.e. , it shows features due to both insulating and metallic species simultaneously .",
    "gradually the signatures of the metallic behavior begin to take over larger and larger range of energy , until eventually they dominate the whole dos . at the same time , while the sample is tuned into the metallic regime , its conductivity rapidly increases and exhibits metallic behavior .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that in the same conditions , the transport experiments will place this sample on the metallic side of the transition , while in the tunneling measurements it will appear as an insulator .",
    "it could be argued that this description is a percolation transition on an atomic scale and that a percolation threshold in a two component system in 3 dimensions should occur at a fractional concentration of @xmath118 ( for site percolation in a diamond structure ) .",
    "@xcite however this transition must take into account in addition to the natural inhomogeneity at the atomic scale , the strong correlations that are ignored in a classical model .",
    "indeed , while we resort to a single particle picture of mobility and density of states for descriptive reasons , we must remind ourselves that this transition is believed to be driven by the correlations which are not single particle effects .",
    "we believe that these current experiments show that thinking in terms of independent particles in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition , despite the convenience of using such pictures , is an oversimplification .",
    "further theoretical work may be able to put these experimental results on a solid footing within the correlation - based models .",
