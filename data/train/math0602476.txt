    "the art of juggling has been around for thousands of years . over the past quarter of a century , the interplay between juggling and mathematics has been well studied .",
    "there has even been a book @xcite devoted to this relationship , dealing with several combinatorial ideas .",
    "numerous juggling software is also available ; in particular , lipson and wright s elegant and wonderful _",
    "@xcite program helped motivate much of this paper .",
    "most of the information useful to juggling can be accessed via the _ juggling information service _",
    "webpage  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to construct and study a map from juggling sequences to topological braids .",
    "an early form of this idea providing motivation can be found in the work of tawney @xcite , where he looks at some classic juggling patterns .    in our discussion",
    ", we remove everything that is not mathematically relevant .",
    "thus , assume the juggler in question is throwing identical objects , referred to as",
    "_ balls_. by convention , there are some basic rules we adhere to in juggling .    1 .",
    "the balls are thrown to a constant beat , occurring at certain equally - spaced discrete moments in time .",
    "2 .   at a given beat , at most one ball",
    "gets caught and then thrown instantly .",
    "3 .   the hands do not move while juggling .",
    "4 .   the pattern in which the balls are thrown is periodic , with no start and no end to this pattern .",
    "throws are made with one hand on odd - numbered beats and the other hand on even - numbered beats .",
    "a throw of a ball which takes @xmath0 beats from being thrown to being caught is called a _ @xmath0-throw_. condition",
    "j5 implies that when @xmath0 is even ( or odd ) , a @xmath0-throw is caught with the same ( or opposite ) hand from which it was thrown .",
    "thus , a @xmath1-throw starting in the left hand would end in the right hand @xmath1 beats later , while a @xmath2-throw starting in the left hand would end back in the left hand after @xmath2 beats . in this notation ,",
    "a @xmath3-throw is a placeholder so that an empty hand can take an action , where no ball gets caught or thrown on that beat .",
    "the following definition from @xcite is used to embody some of the rules above .",
    "[ d : functiondef ] a _ juggling pattern _ is a bijection @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 . a _ juggling sequence _ ( or a _ site swap _ ) is the sequence @xmath7 arising from a juggling pattern .",
    "the number @xmath8 is the _ throw value _ at time @xmath9 , and the number @xmath10 associated to a juggling pattern is its _",
    "period_. thus , a juggling sequence is simply used to keep track of successive throw values . under this terminology ,",
    "the sequence @xmath11 yields the @xmath10-ball _ cascade _ for @xmath10 odd , and the @xmath10-ball _ fountain _ for @xmath10 even ; the @xmath10-ball _ shower _ is given by the @xmath12 pattern .",
    "a juggling sequence can be represented graphically in several ways .",
    "a common way is the _ juggling diagram _ , with the height of the balls in the vertical direction drawn with respect to time .",
    "figure  [ f:51diag ] shows the juggling diagram of the @xmath13 sequence , the lines in this diagram corresponding to the path of the juggled balls traced out over time .     sequence . ]",
    "we denote odd and even numbered beats by solid and open circles , distinguishing the two hands .",
    "the juggling pattern associated to the @xmath13 sequence is @xmath14 it is straightforward to realize that the number of balls used in a juggling pattern @xmath15 is the number of orbits determined by @xmath15 .",
    "for example , the sequence @xmath13 is a @xmath16-ball pattern , as seen in figure  [ f:51diag ] .",
    "a natural question to ask is which sequence of numbers provide valid juggling sequences .",
    "buhler , eisenbud , graham and wright @xcite provide an elegant criterion .",
    "@xcite [ t : graham ] a sequence @xmath17 of nonnegative integers is a valid juggling sequence if and only if    1 .",
    "the average of the collection @xmath18 is some integer b , and 2 .",
    "@xmath19 is a permutation of  @xmath20 .    in this case",
    ", the sequence describes a valid @xmath21-ball juggling sequence .",
    "with the goal of constructing braids in mind , a slightly different graphical representation is preferable . in the jugglers terminology , this is called the _ ladder diagram _ , with the distance between the hands shown in the vertical direction , drawn with respect to time .",
    "figure  [ f:51ladder ] shows the ladder diagram of the @xmath13 sequence , where one hand is the bottom line and the other is the top .     sequence . ]",
    "the viewer is looking at the juggler from above , and the straight lines correspond to the path of the juggled balls traced out over time .",
    "these paths are the parabolic arcs which appear in the juggling diagram shown in figure  [ f:51diag ] above .",
    "indeed , from basic physics , the height of a @xmath0-throw is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "thus , it is easy to show for a crossing appearing in a ladder diagram , a line representing the trace of ball @xmath23 will _ cross over _ a line representing the trace of ball @xmath24 if and only if @xmath23 has a higher throw value than @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ f:51braid ] shows the _ braid diagram _ of the @xmath13 sequence , which encodes crossing information into the ladder diagram .     sequence . ]",
    "the _ physics _ of juggling is quite interesting .",
    "we refer the reader to the pioneering work of magnusson and tiemann @xcite for details , where dwell times , error margins and angle variations are discussed .    before proceeding ,",
    "two problematic situations need to be addressed , both involving collisions of balls under our simplistic model .",
    "first , interactions between odd throws of the same value need to be discussed .",
    "as mentioned above , basic physics guarantees that odd throws of differing values will not collide in our model . however , physics also implies two odd throws of the same value which cross in the juggling diagram will collide in reality .",
    "this is because both will have the same throw height , proportional to the square of their throw value ( and also from reasons involving symmetry ) .",
    "thus , under a simplistic juggling model , the classic juggling sequence @xmath25 ( the @xmath16-ball cascade ) can not be juggled without the balls colliding in midair .",
    "the second problem involves interactions between even throws .",
    "for example , under our juggling model , a classic juggling sequence such as @xmath26 ( called the _ @xmath2-ball fountain _ ) can not be juggled without the balls colliding in midair .",
    "since a @xmath2-throw is even , it is thrown vertically in the air , to be returned to the same hand in @xmath2 beats .",
    "thus any other even throw from the same hand will cause a collision if it is not thrown far enough apart in time .",
    "this is certainly true of @xmath26 .",
    "both of these problems can be resolved by adding a bit of realism to our juggling model .",
    "one lesson learned from actual juggling is that the hands move slightly during catches and throws .",
    "indeed , a catch is made by moving the corresponding hand slightly out of standard position , away from the other hand . after being caught , the ball",
    "is then carried temporarily as it is moved slightly in ( closer towards the other hand ) before release .",
    "thus , the following changes are made to the juggling rules , resulting in a modified model .",
    "1 .   at a given beat , at most one ball gets caught ( slightly before the beat ) and then thrown ( slightly after the beat ) .",
    "the hands move slightly such that a ball is caught on the outside and thrown from the inside .",
    "we show that this minor modification is enough to resolve the collision issues present .",
    "in order to quantify our measurements , we introduce _ dwell _ and _ carry _ values .",
    "the dwell value @xmath27 is the amount of time ( measured with respect to the beat of the throws ) a ball is held between catching it and throwing it .",
    "the carry value @xmath28 is the distance each hand moves from catching to throwing . for our purposes , let @xmath29 and @xmath30 , both being very small values of our choosing .",
    "figure  [ f : proof ] provides the ladder diagram of the basic set - up : two odd @xmath0-throws are examined with dwell and carry values .",
    "the difference of beats between the second ball thrown and the first ball caught is denoted by @xmath31 , with an actual difference of @xmath32 taking the dwell value into consideration .",
    "let @xmath33 be the difference in time between the throw of the second ball and the intersection of the two paths from the perspective of the ladder diagram .",
    "we can calculate the actual value of @xmath33 by solving for the intersection of the two lines , obtaining @xmath34 where @xmath35 we need to find out which ball will be higher at this point of intersection .        since the height is parabolic , with maximum height reached at the midpoint of the throw distance , we need to compute which throw is closest to the midpoint value at the intersection .",
    "the second throw has horizontal distance @xmath33 .",
    "the first throw has horizontal distance @xmath36 to the point of intersection . from symmetry , this is the same height as a distance of @xmath37 the midway distance of maximal height is @xmath38 .",
    "since we are assuming @xmath39 and since @xmath0 and @xmath31 are natural numbers , then by the archimedean principle we can choose a value for @xmath28 such that @xmath40 .",
    "thus , @xmath41 in other words , the first ( earlier ) throw will have a higher height than second ( later ) one at the crossing .",
    "notice the arguments above carry through when @xmath42 .",
    "however , for the sake of realism , we choose a small positive value for @xmath27 .",
    "[ t : collide ] for a given juggling sequence , the balls will not collide for a small enough choice of carry value @xmath43 .    any crossing in the ladder diagram will be of two kinds : one between two throws ( figure  [ f : oddeven]a ) or one between a throw and a carry ( figure  [ f : oddeven]b ) .",
    "any crossing of the latter kind is easily resolved , since the line traced out by a carry ( the movement of a hand carrying a ball ) has height zero .",
    "thus , only crossings between two throws @xmath44 and @xmath45 need to be addressed .",
    "when @xmath46 , the @xmath44-throw will cross above the @xmath45-throw since the balls will have different heights proportional to the square of their throw values .",
    "when @xmath47 is odd , the argument outlined above ( for small enough @xmath43 value ) will guarantee that the earlier of the two throws will cross over the latter .",
    "if @xmath48 is even , the throws will never cross since they travel along parallel trajectories .",
    "the last possibility is when one value is odd and the other even , as shown in figure  [ f : oddeven]a . here , as @xmath49",
    ", this intersection will occur arbitrarily close to when the odd throw is caught ( at height zero ) while the even throw is still in the air .",
    "thus for a small enough value of @xmath50 , the balls will not collide .",
    "indeed , all crossing issues can be resolved due to the theorem above ; figure  [ f:345braid ] shows an example , the braid diagram of the @xmath51 sequence .     sequence . ]    the rest of the paper will mostly be concerned with crossings of odd throws of differing values .",
    "thus , although dwells and carries can occur in our juggling model , we will henceforth visually represent the braid diagrams without them .",
    "braids have a rich history in mathematics , appearing in numerous areas .",
    "we refer the reader to adams ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) for an elementary introduction to this subject .",
    "roughly , an _",
    "@xmath10-braid _ is a set of @xmath10 disjoint arcs running between two vertical bars where every vertical plane between the two bars must intersect each arc exactly once .",
    "the endpoints of the arcs are given an ordered labeling . starting with a trivial @xmath10-braid ,",
    "let @xmath52 denote the braid where the strand at the @xmath53-th position crosses _ over _ the strand at the @xmath54-st position .",
    "similarly , let @xmath55 represent the braid with the crossing of the strand at the @xmath53-th position _ under _ the @xmath54-st position .",
    "since any braid can be obtained by repeatedly crossing adjacent strands , every braid can be expressed as a _ word _ , an ordered collection of @xmath56 elements .",
    "the @xmath10-braids have an algebraic group structure , where the composition map of two braids @xmath57 simply attaches the @xmath10 ordered endpoints of the arcs of @xmath58 to the @xmath10 starting points of the arcs of @xmath59 .",
    "we denote the group of @xmath10-braids by @xmath60 , calling it the _ braid group_. in actuality , elements of the braid group are _ equivalence classes _ of braids .",
    "the following theorem by artin ( 1926 ) gives the relations needed to identify isomorphic braids :    the braid group @xmath60 is generated by @xmath61 with the relations :    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath63  if  @xmath64 .",
    "a natural operation to perform on braids is their _ closure _ , identifying the endpoints of the strands of the braids .",
    "the result after closing a braid is a _ solid torus braid _ , a braid in a solid torus where each meridional disk intersects each strand of the braid exactly once . removing the restriction of being in a solid torus allows a closed braid to become a _ link _ in @xmath65 .",
    "markov ( 1935 ) introduced two new relations which algebraically encapsulate our discussion .",
    "let @xmath66 be a word in @xmath60 .    1 .",
    "( conjugation ) @xmath67 .",
    "2 .   ( stabilization ) @xmath68  where @xmath69 .",
    "the braid group up to the conjugation relation describes the solid torus braids .",
    "the braid group up to both conjugation and stabilization describes links .",
    "thus , the set of all solid torus braids ( and links ) can be generated by @xmath56 elements and their inverses .",
    "the smallest part of the juggling diagram which can be used to tile it is called the _",
    "fundamental chamber_. more precisely , a juggling sequence has _ exact period _ @xmath10 if it does not have another period @xmath70 for a divisor @xmath70 of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , a fundamental chamber for a juggling sequence with exact period @xmath10 has length @xmath71 when @xmath10 is odd and @xmath10 when it is even .",
    "this asymmetry between odd and even length patterns arises from throwing from right and left hands . after an odd number of throws , the next throw will be from the opposite hand ; thus , doubling the pattern will be the first repeatable set of throws that ends on the correct hand .",
    "let @xmath72 be the map from juggling sequences to solid torus braids , defined by taking the closure of a fundamental chamber of the braid diagram .",
    "theorem  [ t : collide ] guarantees @xmath72 to be well - defined .",
    "note that there is no canonical map from juggling sequences to braids .",
    "the translation of the fundamental chamber produces alterations of the starting and ending points of the braid . indeed , taking the closure of the chamber removes all ambiguity , resulting in solid torus braids .",
    "figure  [ f : knots ] shows examples of @xmath72 evaluated on sequences @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . a fundamental chamber in each braid diagram is shaded . by placing the solid torus braids in @xmath65 ( allowing stabilization ) , then @xmath73 maps to the unknot and @xmath74 maps to the trefoil .",

    "@xmath74 . ]",
    "the natural question is to ask which links arise from juggling patterns . the following is the key result , the proof of which will consume most of the remaining paper .",
    "[ t : bigthm ] the map @xmath72 is surjective .",
    "this , along with markov s theorem , results in the following :    for every link , there exists a juggling sequence which maps to the link .",
    "our method of attacking theorem  [ t : bigthm ] is by constructing a juggling pattern for every solid torus braid .",
    "we begin with the trivial solid torus @xmath10-braid , which will serve as a building block . before providing the juggling pattern ,",
    "it is first described from the perspective of the balls ( or strands of the braid ) .",
    "the first ball of the @xmath10 balls is thrown at a constant beat of @xmath16 units , being thrown at @xmath75 .",
    "the second ball is thrown at a constant beat of @xmath76 units , being thrown at @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 and let @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "in general , the @xmath0-th ball is thrown at a constant beat of @xmath81 , being thrown at time @xmath82 .",
    "we denote this pattern as @xmath83 , where @xmath10 corresponds to the number of balls thrown .    figure  [ f : in ] shows the braid diagrams for @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "we refer to the strand traced out by the @xmath0-th ball as the _ @xmath0-strand_.    , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . ]",
    "notice how a given strand always crosses over or always crosses under any another strand .",
    "the juggling pattern can then be defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 . here , @xmath0 keeps track of the balls and @xmath90 the beats in which the @xmath0-th ball is thrown .",
    "the function @xmath91 is a valid juggling pattern .",
    "we need to show that eq .",
    "satisfies the two criteria set forth in theorem  [ t : graham ] .",
    "the set of beats in which ball @xmath0 is thrown ( with throw length @xmath81 ) is @xmath92 where @xmath89 . when @xmath93 , then @xmath94 and this is clearly the smallest such positive value of @xmath70 for which this property holds . thus , there are @xmath95 throws of length @xmath81 .",
    "taking the average of all the throw lengths yields @xmath96 meeting the first criteria .",
    "so the number of balls in this pattern is @xmath10 , as desired .    for the second condition",

    ". since all throws of a given ball @xmath0 are of the same height @xmath81 , from theorem  [ t : collide ] , the @xmath0-strand will cross over all @xmath102-strands , when @xmath103 and cross under all @xmath102-strands when @xmath104 .",
    "this results in the trivial solid torus braid .",

    "[ t : swap ] @xmath114 is a juggling sequence .",
    "the two conditions of theorem  [ t : graham ] need to be satisfied .",

    "the _ sites _ @xmath122 and @xmath123 in which the balls land will _ swap _ positions . indeed , the site swap terminology derives its name from this property .    in our context ,",
    "when attempting to construct the generators of the braid group , the creation of a crossing is simply an extension of this idea of swapping sites .",
    "starting with the identity braid @xmath83 , the strands to be crossed are chosen and two of their throws are manipulated ( swapped ) , creating a crossing in an otherwise trivial braid .",
    "figure  [ f : trivial ] shows a part of the braid diagram of @xmath91 , where only the @xmath0 and @xmath124 strands are depicted .",

    "this alteration provides the appropriate crossing needed , and provides the proof of theorem  [ t : bigthm ] .    choosing the starting position of the fundamental chamber of @xmath170 yields an ordering of the _ position _ of the strands , determining @xmath66 .",
    "this ordering is _ not necessarily _ the ordering of the @xmath10 balls , which are used to label the strands .",
    "this is crucial to note , since a site swap switches the _ strand _ formed by the @xmath0 ball with the _ strand _ formed by the @xmath124 ball .",
    "however , since our elements are solid torus braids , we have the ability to slide our strands in the solid torus to the appropriate order ( due to conjugation by markov s theorem ) .",
    "although our construction allows us to prove all links can be juggled , it is far from realistic or efficient .",
    "the throw values were chosen in powers of 3 ( a prime ) in order to make transparent the construction of a valid juggling sequence , along with isolating crossings of two strands .",

    "since @xmath185 is a @xmath186-ball pattern , the ball index of the trefoil must be two .",
    "moreover , @xmath25 guarantees a throw index of three for the trefoil .",
    "an underlying issue to this problem is understanding @xmath72 .",
    "we have only been able to prove that @xmath72 is surjective , not knowing much more about the map itself .",
    "based on the figures above , _ up to conjugation _ , @xmath72 maps @xmath187 the first word is an element in the solid torus braid with three strands ; the last three have four strands .",
    "thus , an algorithmic description of this map is needed , not based on crossing information in figures but on values of the juggling sequences .",
    "the version of a juggling pattern used here is sometimes referred to as _ vanilla site swap_. allowing multiple jugglers , simultaneous throws , and varying throws ( reverse juggling ) can be encoded into more complicated models ; polster ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) provides a nice introduction to these ideas .",
