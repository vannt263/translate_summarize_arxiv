    "all the @xmath1 cross sections and the @xmath0 cross sections below 180 mev / c , open circles and solid circles , respectively , were measured by the obelix collaboration @xcite and the @xmath0 cross sections above 180 mev / c , solid triangles , were measured by brckner et al .",
    "@xcite using a different experimental setup .",
    "the figure shows that the results in the two momentum ranges join very smoothly and that above 200 mev / c there are no observed differences between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 cross sections , although the former contains contributions of i=0 and i=1 isospin states whereas the latter is a pure i=1 isospin state .     and @xmath1 on the proton , see text for references .",

    "however , the increase of the cross sections for the @xmath0 is much stronger than the increase for @xmath1 , resulting from the coulomb focusing effect which has been observed in annihilation cross sections of @xmath0 on nuclei @xcite . for very strong absorption which is typical of antiproton interactions , the ` black disk ' cross section @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the radius ,",

    "it is therefore concluded that at very low energies the major differences between @xmath0 and @xmath1 annihilation on the proton are due to the coulomb focusing effect .",
    "having demonstrated that the differences between low energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 annihilation cross sections on the proton are fully explained by the coulomb focusing effect , we turn to the @xmath1 annihilation cross sections on six nuclear targets between c and pb @xcite .",
    "here it is impossible to compare directly between experimental results and we use an optical potential to calculate cross sections for @xmath0 on the same targets and at the same energies as for the @xmath1 measurements . only an outline is presented here as more details are given in @xcite .    for very low energies of interest we begin by analyzing the extended and precise experimental results for strong interaction effects in antiprotonic atoms , adopting the ` global ' analysis of 90 data points across the periodic table done a decade ago @xcite .",

    "the minimum in @xmath33 is obtained for a value of the parameter @xmath36 which implies values of @xmath37 in agreement with the great majority of results regarding these differences , obtained by a variety of methods @xcite . in @xcite",
    "similar results are presented for a gaussian interaction .",
    "it is worth noting that the rms radii involved and the strong interaction parameters @xmath38 are the same , within errors , for the two interaction models .",
    "the above optical potential was shown in @xcite to reproduce very well angular distributions for elastic scattering of @xmath0 by c , ca and pb at 300 mev / c .",

    "in fact , the momenta where the ratio of the calculated @xmath0 to @xmath1 cross sections is 2 are in remarkable agreement with table [ tab : coul ] , showing the dominance of coulomb focusing at low momenta .",

    "figure [ fig : nbarssn ] shows the single measured @xmath0 cross section and the seven experimental @xmath1 cross sections in relation to the calculated annihilation cross sections from the present optical potential .",
    "the figure suggests that measured @xmath1 cross sections around 100  mev / c are larger than the corresponding @xmath0 cross sections , which is at variance with the results for a proton target as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbarnbarp ] .",
    "coulomb focusing ( table [ tab : coul ] ) suggests that the @xmath1 annihilation cross sections on sn are expected to be a factor of 3 _ smaller _ than the corresponding @xmath0 cross sections near 100  mev / c .",
    "total annihilation cross sections for antiprotons and antineutron on the proton show smooth variation with energy between lab momenta of 50 and 400  mev / c .",
    "the marked increase of the @xmath0 cross sections relative to the @xmath1 ones below 200  mev / c is fully consistent with the effect of coulomb focusing . above that momentum",
    "the cross sections for the two types of projectile are practically identical , suggesting that annihilation cross sections at low energies are insensitive to isospin effects .",
    "phenomenological optical potentials reproduce well all the available results for @xmath0-nucleus interaction from antiprotonic atoms to elastic scattering and annihilation cross section up to 600  mev / c , with no evidence for an isovector term .",
    "consequently this potential is used to calculate annihilation cross sections , and comparisons with the measured @xmath1-nucleus cross section reveal unexpected features of coulomb effects .",
    "no explanation for this result is known at present .",
    "direct comparison between experimental cross sections without the help of a model is currently possible only for a single measurement on sn ( in addition to the many results for a proton target ) and that shows the @xmath1 cross section to be larger than the @xmath0 one .",
