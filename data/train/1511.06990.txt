    "exploring the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in external magnetic field has recently attracted a lot of interest , such as the presumable presence of the strong magnetic field in the neutron star or magnetar , an early stage of heavy ion collisions , and some topics related to physics on the early universe .",
    "for instance , in off - central heavy ion collisions , the scale of the magnetic field reaches up to about a few hundreds of mev , which could also be related to dynamics of quark - gluon plasma . in this respect ,",
    "several fascinating qcd phenomena in the magnetic field have been proposed : the chiral magnetic effect , the magnetic catalysis or inverse magnetic catalysis , and so forth .",
    "more on striking and exotic magnetic phenomena involves hadron physics : some of studies implies that vector meson ( rho meson ) can condense due to the presence of a strong magnetic field , which is naively expected from the landau - quantized mass of charged particles with spin 1 . in this respect ,",
    "several works have been done based on effective models for qcd  @xcite , and also some objection against the rho meson condensation from current lattice simulation has been reported , say , in ref .",
    "@xcite . understanding",
    "the qcd in magnetic field is therefore getting excited not only on the field theoretical ground , but also on some phenomenological aspect involving other research fields .    in this paper , we discuss the magnetic responses of vector meson masses based on a chiral effective model including vector mesons as gauge bosons of some gauge symmetry : it is so called the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) model  @xcite . setting the background photon gauge to be a constant magnetic field , and employing the lightest two - flavor system including the pion , rho and omega mesons in the spectrum",
    ", we evaluate the effective masses influenced under the magnetic field in a way of the derivative / chiral expansion established in the hls model .    at the leading order , the g - factor of the charged rho meson",
    "is fixed to be 2 , implying that the rho meson at this order is dealt with , just like a point - like spin-1 particle .",
    "going beyond the leading order , we find anomalous magnetic interactions of the charged rho meson .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment arises from @xmath1 terms , and its magnitude can be manifestly controlled in the derivative / chiral expansion .",
    "it turns out that up to @xmath1 the charged rho meson tends to become massless .",
    "more remarkably , nontrivial magnetic - dependence of neutral mesons emerges from @xmath1 terms of the hls model .",
    "this is tied with the significant mixing among neutral mesons under the magnetic field , breaking the spin and lorentz invariance . as a consequence ,",
    "we observe the dramatic enhancement of the omega meson mass , which is testable in future lattice simulations .",
