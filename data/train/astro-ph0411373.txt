    "a current sheet structure with reversed magnetic fields can be seen everywhere in the universe . among",
    "the magnetic field dissipation processes in the current sheet , magnetic reconnection may be the most popular one . breaking the topology of magnetic field lines , it releases the magnetic energy into particles kinetic energy in a relatively short time - scale ( several to several tens of an alfvn transit time @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the half thickness of the current sheet and @xmath3 is the typical alfvn speed ) .",
    "it plays an essential role in solar terrestrial sites such as the earth s",
    "magnetotail @xcite and source regions of the solar flare @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is expected in astrophysical sites such as active galactic nuclei @xcite and pulsar winds , especially their well - studied example of the crab nebula @xcite . in case of the crab nebula , energy conversion in a relativistic wind of @xmath0 plasmas",
    "has been a long - standing problem ( the so - called the `` @xmath4-problem '' , where @xmath4 is the ratio of the poynting flux energy to the particle kinetic flux ) @xcite . the wind is originally poynting - dominated ( @xmath5 ) close to the neutron star @xcite ; but",
    "it is kinetic - dominated near the termination shock ( @xmath4 is far less than the unity ; @xmath6 by @xcite and @xmath7 by @xcite ) .",
    "recently , relativistic magnetic reconnection in the striped current sheets has been discussed as the most possible dissipation mechanism @xcite .",
    "the properties of relativistic reconnection in @xmath0 plasmas have been investigated by an analytical study @xcite and by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "one of the most important features of relativistic reconnection is the generation of non - thermal particles due to direct acceleration by dc electric field around the @xmath8-type region @xcite .",
    "however , the above discussion is based on a two - dimensional picture of reconnection .",
    "instabilities in a cross - field plane are also of critical importance to understanding a realistic current sheet problem that includes reconnection . does reconnection grow faster than cross - field instabilities ?",
    "is reconnection the fastest dissipation process ? in the case of non - relativistic ion - electron plasmas ,",
    "the following instabilities have been discussed : the lower hybrid drift instability ( lhdi ) @xcite , the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) @xcite , and the drift kink instability ( dki ) @xcite .",
    "they lead to plasma heating and particle acceleration as well as the triggering of reconnection .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to search for the basic properties of such cross - field instabilities and of the non - thermal particle generation in a relativistic @xmath0 current sheet . in this letter ,",
    "we report our 2d simulations in a cross - field plane of a relativistic @xmath0 current sheet and we report a new acceleration process related to the relativistic drift kink instability ( rdki ) @xcite .",
    "the simulation code used here is a three - dimensional particle - in - cell code .",
    "the system size is composed of 1 ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 256 ( @xmath10 ) @xmath9 512 ( @xmath11 ) grids .",
    "we consider periodic boundaries in the @xmath8 , @xmath10 directions , and we periodically set two simulation boxes in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "the typical scale of the current sheet @xmath2 is set to 10 grids , so that the y boundaries are located at @xmath12 , and the z boundaries are located at @xmath13 .",
    "we take the relativistic harris model as the initial current sheet .",
    "the magnetic field , the density of plasmas and their distribution functions are described by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 $ ] , respectively . in the above equations",
    ", @xmath17 is the magnitude of magnetic field in the lobe ( background region ) , @xmath18 is the number density of plasmas in the current sheet , @xmath19 are the drift velocities for each species ; @xmath20 for positrons , @xmath21 for electrons , @xmath22 is the lorentz factor for @xmath23 [ @xmath24^{-1/2}$ ] ] , @xmath25 is the particle energy , @xmath26 is the relativistic four velocity of @xmath27^{-1/2 } \\cdot \\bm{v}$ ] and @xmath28 is the temperature . in the first simulation , we set @xmath29 and @xmath30 . we set no driving force to excite instabilities , so that instabilities arise from thermal noise .",
    "we set no background plasmas .",
    "the total energy is conserved within an error of @xmath31 throughout the simulation run .",
    "snapshots at three characteristic stages of the simulation are presented in figure  [ fig : kink ] .",
    "the three left panels in figure  [ fig : kink ] show color contours of the plasma density at ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 , ( @xmath34 ) @xmath35 and ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37 , where time is normalized by the light transit time @xmath38 .",
    "the three middle panels show color contours of the electric field @xmath39 at the corresponding time ; the white lines show contours of @xmath40 .",
    "the three panels show the particles energy spectra for the whole simulation .",
    "the horizontal axis shows the particles energy normalized by @xmath41 .    as shown in the top three panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] , we observe a kink - type modulation of the current sheet .",
    "we confirmed that this is a signature of the rdki , a relativistic extension of the dki , which is a long - wavelength , current - driven instability in a thin current sheet . in the top middle panel , one can see the typical structure of @xmath39 components of the polarization of electric fields of rdki .",
    "the sign of @xmath39 is positive in the yellow regions , while it is negative in the blue regions .",
    "two types of regions appear alternatively along the current sheet and they are anti - symmetric with the neutral plane ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath43 direction using the lobe magnetic fields and the observed sign of @xmath39 is consistent with the @xmath11-displacement of the plasma bulk motion .",
    "the symmetric @xmath44 components are also observed and their values are a little less than or comparable to those of @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath45 components are negligible .",
    "since the system is uniform in the @xmath8 direction , there is no electrostatic @xmath45 fields .",
    "after @xmath46 , the instability turns into its non linear stage .",
    "the three middle panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] are snapshots of the current sheet at @xmath47 .",
    "the current sheet is strongly folded within a zone of @xmath48 . due to the @xmath11-displacement by rdki ,",
    "red ( originally yellow ) regions , where @xmath49 , are placed in a row around the neutral plane ( @xmath50 ) in the midmost panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] .",
    "the total kinetic energy in the system has increased by 30% at this time .",
    "importantly , we observe a clear sign of the particle acceleration in a high - energy tail in the energy spectrum of the middle - right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] .",
    "we will discuss the acceleration process later .",
    "the kinked - shape of the current sheet is not stable , because fragments of the anti - parallel currents ( @xmath51 ) pull each other .",
    "as they start to collide , the system turns into the `` mixed '' stage .",
    "the snapshots at this stage are presented in the bottom three panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] at @xmath52 . due to the enhanced diffusion by sheet collisions ,",
    "the total kinetic energy has increased by 170% at this time . in the energy spectrum of the bottom - right panel",
    ", one can recognize both a remnant of the non - thermal tail and global plasma heating .",
    "finally , the mixed current sheet slowly evolves into the broadened current sheet , which is 3 - 4 times thicker than the initial state .",
    "the saturated level of the total kinetic energy is 330%-340% at @xmath53 or later .",
    "the spectrum looks unchanged from the mixed stage ; one can still observe the non thermal tail .",
    "now , we again take a look at the instability during its linear stage . the observed growth rate ( @xmath54 )",
    "is plotted as a function of @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ fig : growth ] , where @xmath56 is the wavenumber and @xmath57 is the gyro frequency @xmath58 .",
    "the growth rate and wave length of the most dominant mode of rdki are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "we have also calculated eigen functions and their growth rates of the rdki , by linearizing relativistic two - fluid equations .",
    "the theoretical growth rates for the present case are shown as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : growth ] .",
    "the simulation results are consistent with them except for shorter wavelength of @xmath61 , where the instability is suppressed by kinetic effects .",
    "we observe a slight signature of the relativistic drift sausage instability ( rdsi ) along with rdki .",
    "however , rdsi is less influential on the current sheet deformation and particle acceleration .",
    "note that no velocity - shear - driven mode such as khi is excited , ant that is because there is no velocity shear between drifting plasmas in the current sheet and empty background plasmas . also note that lhdi is not excited in an @xmath0 case , because there is no delay of a positron s response to an electron s .",
    "next , we discuss an acceleration mechanism that is found at the non linear stage of rdki . by analyzing trajectories of highly accelerated particles , we found that the main site of particle acceleration is the central channel around @xmath62 , where the current sheet was originally located . for simple discussion",
    ", we call this channel the `` acceleration channel ( ac ) '' .",
    "we illustrate the acceleration mechanism in schematic views in fig .",
    "[ fig : accel ] . in the upper view",
    ", the structure of the polarization of @xmath39 fields at the linear stage are illustrated .",
    "they are anti symmetric with respect to @xmath11 and both positive and negative regions are alternatively located along the sheet .",
    "passing through their meandering orbits , some particles can resonate with the @xmath39 fields .",
    "some of them gain their energy and others lose their energy . at the non - linear stage , due to the @xmath11-displacement of the current sheet ,",
    "the positive @xmath39 regions are now located around the ac .",
    "nside the positive @xmath39 regions , typical values of the fields are @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "contrary to the reconnection @xcite in which @xmath65 in an acceleration site , the value of @xmath66 is less than unity inside the positive @xmath39 regions , and so low - energy particles travel into the @xmath67 direction .",
    "however , fewer populations of high - energy particles can travel across the positive @xmath39 regions , because their larmor radii @xmath68 are larger than the half - wavelength of rdki ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "they gain their energy from the electric field @xmath39 , cross the current sheet and move into the neighboring positive @xmath39 regions . since @xmath68 becomes larger as particles gain more energy ( @xmath70 in non - relativistic case and @xmath71 in relativistic case ) , accelerated particles usually satisfies the crossing condition of @xmath72 in the following positive @xmath39 regions . in this way , they are successively accelerated in the ac , passing through multiple positive @xmath39 regions into the @xmath73 direction .",
    "the above condition can be interpreted as the `` trapping condition '' inside the ac .",
    "higher accelerated particles tend to stay in the ac , because larger @xmath68 prevents them from escaping .",
    "this is why the non - thermal tail is enhanced in the energy spectrum .",
    "we think this type of enhanced acceleration can be found in any kink - type instability in a thin current sheet , as long as its wavelength is comparable to a particle s larmor radius . for example , it may be applicable to acceleration of ions , when a thin current sheet of ion - electron plasmas is modulated by khi .",
    "the folded structure evolves into the mixed stage when its @xmath11-displacement ( @xmath74 ) is nearly the same as the half - wavelength of rdki ( @xmath75 ) . assuming that @xmath76 is typically @xmath77 in the positive @xmath39 regions , the time scale of the non - linear stage ( @xmath78 ) is approximated by @xmath79 .",
    "after the system turns into the mixed stage , a few number of high - energy particles and a lot of low - energy particles in the current sheet interact with the positive @xmath39 regions . then the magnetic fields are dissipated in a time - scale of tens of @xmath80 .",
    "roughly speaking , the magnetic field energy is consumed by joule heating of the @xmath39 fields and the total current @xmath81 in the broadened current sheet .",
    "the magnetic energy stored between the folded curves is approximated by @xmath82 .",
    "we assume that the average value of the electric fields @xmath83 , where the factor 0.5 represents the fact that positive @xmath39 is not uniform in the ac .",
    "the total current @xmath81 is represented by the zeroth order current @xmath84 .",
    "thus the dissipation time scale ( @xmath85 ) is approximated by @xmath86 .",
    "next , we briefly compare rdki and magnetic reconnection @xcite . in table",
    "[ table ] , the parameters for several simulation runs of rdki and for relevant runs of reconnection are presented . throughout",
    "the simulation runs , we calculate the ratio of the non - thermal kinetic energy to the total kinetic energy ( @xmath87 ) and their maximum values in time are presented in table  [ table ] . in case of run",
    "d3 , @xmath88 is not resolved by our method .",
    "the maximum energies ( @xmath89 ) are also presented in table  [ table ] . in the case of rdki ,",
    "the highest energy particles run in the ac into the @xmath73 direction with the light speed during the non - thermal stage and the mixed stage .",
    "their maximum energies are estimated by @xmath90 and the estimated values agree with the simulation results . in three cases of reconnection",
    ", the evolution seems to be restricted by the periodic system size of @xmath91 , because two outflow jets travel into the @xmath92 direction .",
    "due to this restriction , the upper limits of particle energy are estimated by @xmath93 in table  [ table ] in reconnection cases .",
    "however , the obtained maximum energies ( @xmath89 ) by reconnection are far larger than the maximum energies by rdki . from the viewpoint of field dissipation ( e.g. striped pulsar winds )",
    ", rdki can dissipate more magnetic energy .",
    "the linear growth rates of the energy conversion ( @xmath94 ) are presented in table 1 .",
    "generally speaking , rdki grows _",
    "faster _ in a relativistic current sheet ( @xmath95 ) and it converts @xmath96 times as much energy as the initial kinetic energy in the current sheet in a time scale of @xmath85 . moreover , rdki spontaneously occurs everywhere in the @xmath8 direction , while single reconnection requires a wide spatial range in the @xmath8 direction in order for the outflow jets to escape .",
    "therefore , even in runs r3 and d3 , in which rdki grows slower , reconnection takes twice as long to dissipate the same amount of the magnetic energy as rdki . on the contrary , reconnection is the more favored candidate as the origin of non - thermal particles .",
    "it produces more non - thermal energy of @xmath88 than rdki as a result of the high ratio of @xmath87 .",
    "our initial results of a three - dimensional simulation show that rdki occurs almost uniformly in the current sheet . also ,  @xcite have presented their three - dimensional results of triggered reconnection .",
    "they have referred to the importance of rdki in the three - dimensional case and a signature of a two - dimensional - like rdki is observed outside the reconnection region . in case of multiple current sheets structure , such as striped pulsar winds , there are several possibilities of enhanced field dissipation .",
    "if the distance between two currents is less than the critical distance of @xmath97 , the two current sheets collide with each other and 90% or more of the magnetic energy will be dissipated into the particle energy . in typical cases , @xmath98 7 - 8 , but its dependency on @xmath28 or @xmath23 should be further investigated .",
    "we also note that the secondary rdki takes place in the broadened current sheet in some occasions .",
    "let us summarize this letter .",
    "first , we investigate the rdki in a thin @xmath0 current sheet .",
    "second , we find a new acceleration process that uses a folded structure of a current sheet .",
    "the unique point of this process is that ac electric fields evolve into a dc acceleration channel .",
    "third , due to the enhanced acceleration , a non - thermal particles are produced .",
    "fourth , comparison with reconnection shows that rdki is more favorable to dissipate the magnetic energy in the current sheet structure .",
    "we believe that rdki provides a crucial clue to the energy dissipation problem in the current sheets in the universe , including striped pulsar winds .",
