    "wigner introduced his famous quasiprobability density function on phase space in order to consider semiclassical approximations to the quantum evolution of the density matrix @xcite . for a system with one degree of freedom and classical hamiltonian h = p^2/2 m + v(q ) , [ hamiltonian1 ] he found for the evolution of the wigner function @xmath0 , w(q , p , t)_t = v(q)w(q , p , t)_p -w(q , p , t)_q -\\ { v(q)w(q , p , t)_ppp -v(q)w(q , p , t)_qpp . .",

    "[ wigner_evolution1 ] here we have introduced the notation @xmath1 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath4 , _ etc . _ the first two terms on the rhs in ( [ wigner_evolution1 ] ) define the classical liouvillean evolution , while the terms of order @xmath5 define the first semiclassical approximation to the full quantum evolution of the wigner function , and so on .",
    "following the subsequent works of groenewold @xcite and moyal @xcite , we now recognize the rhs of ( [ wigner_evolution1 ] ) as the expansion in ascending powers of @xmath6 of the star , or moyal , bracket of the hamiltonian @xmath7 and the wigner function @xmath8 , \\{h , w } _",
    "= h(j/2)w , j= - , w_t=\\{h , w}_=hjw - hj^3w+o(^4).[star_bracket1 ] here the superscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the janus operator @xmath11 indicate the directions in which the differential operators act .",
    "the leading term @xmath12 in the last equation represents the poisson bracket of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and corresponds to the first two terms on the rhs in ( [ wigner_evolution1 ] ) .",
    "all this is very well known .",
    "it is a central ingredient of the so - called phase space formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite , where operators on hilbert space are mapped into functions on phase space , and in particular the density operator is mapped into the wigner function .",
    "less well known is that , in a completely analogous way , classical mechanics can be reformulated in hilbert space @xcite , with the classical liouville density mapped into a quasidensity operator @xcite that we have called elsewhere @xcite the groenewold operator .",
    "the evolution of this operator in time is defined by what we have called @xcite the odot bracket , and the expansion of this bracket in ascending powers of @xmath6 defines a series of semiquantum approximations to classical dynamics , starting with the quantum commutator .    in this way",
    ", we explore the classical - quantum interface in a new way , approaching classical mechanics from quantum mechanics , which is now regarded as a first approximation .",
    "so we stand on its head the traditional approach , which approaches quantum mechanics from classical mechanics , regarded as a first approximation .",
    "in order to see how this works , we recall firstly @xcite that the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics is defined by the weyl - wigner transform @xmath13 , which maps operators @xmath14 on hilbert space into functions @xmath15 on phase space , a = w(a),a = a(q , p ) , [ ww_transform1 ] and in particular defines the wigner function @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the density matrix defining the state of the quantum system .",
    "then ( t)=tr((t ) a)=a(q , p)w(q , p , t)dqdp = a(t ) , w(q , p , t)dqdp=1,[averages1 ] but @xmath8 is not in general everywhere nonnegative ; it is a quasiprobability density function .    in more detail ,",
    "@xmath15 is defined by first regarding @xmath14 as an integral operator with kernel @xmath18 in the coordinate representation , and then setting a(q , p)=w(a)(q , p)= a_k(q - x/2,q+x/2)e^ipx / dx . [ ww_transform2 ] the transform of the operator product on hilbert space then defines the noncommutative star product on phase space , ( ab)=ab , [ star_product ] leading to the star bracket as the image of @xmath19 the commutator , ( [ a , b]/i)=(ab - ba)/i=\\{a , b}_. [ star_bracket ] it can now be seen that the quantum evolution of the density matrix _ t= [ h , ] , [ quantum_evolution ] is mapped by the weyl - wigner transform @xmath13 into the evolution equation for the wigner function w_t=\\{h , w } _ [ wigner_evolution3 ] as in ( [ star_bracket1 ] ) , so leading to the sequence of semiclassical approximations as described in the introduction . in ( [ quantum_evolution ] ) , @xmath20 is the quantum hamiltonian operator , so that @xmath21 . in order to define semiquantum approximations to classical dynamics , we begin by considering the inverse weyl - wigner transform @xmath22 , which maps functions @xmath15 on phase space into operators @xmath14 on hilbert space , so enabling a hilbert space formulation of classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "we have a_k(x , y)= w^-1(a)_k(x , y)= a([x+y]/2,p)e^ip(x - y)/dp , [ ww_inverse ] which defines the kernel of @xmath14 , and hence @xmath14 itself , in terms of @xmath15 . in particular the groenewold operator @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "then a(t)=a(q , p)dqdp = tr(ag(t))= , ( g(t))=1,[g_properties ] but @xmath25 is not nonnegative definite in general ; it is a quasidensity operator .",
    "it can be seen that the development so far is completely analogous to the development of the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics",
    ". we can use @xmath22 to map all of classical mechanics into a hilbert space formulation @xcite . to complete the story , we need to say what happens to the classical evolution of the liouville density _",
    "t = hj[poisson ] under the action of @xmath22 .",
    "obviously the lhs maps into @xmath26 ; the question is , what happens to the poisson bracket on the rhs .",
    "to proceed , we note firstly by analogy with the definition of the star product that we can define a commutative odot product of operators on hilbert space    = w^-1(ab ) .",
    "[ odot_product ] this is an interesting product , quite distinct from the well known jordan product of operators , which is also commutative . unlike the jordan product ,",
    "however , this odot product is associative .",
    "some of its other characteristic properties have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "next we note that @xmath27 so that ^-1 ( a_q)=[p , a]=a_q , , [ q_derivative1 ] where @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , we define ^-1 ( a_p)=[a , q]=a_p , ^-1 ( a_qp ) = [ [ p , a],q]=a_qp , etc .",
    "[ q_derivative2 ]    then ^-1 ( ajb)= a_q _ p - a_p_q = [ a , b ] _ , , [ odot_bracket ] which defines the odot bracket as the inverse image of @xmath29 the poisson bracket .",
    "from the poisson bracket it inherits antisymmetry and a jacobi identity .",
    "our next task is to find an expansion of the odot bracket in ascending powers of @xmath6 , analogous to the expansion ( [ star_bracket1 ] ) of the star bracket , in order to define a sequence of semiquantum approximations to classical dynamics .",
    "we set m= ( ) , [ moyal_operator ] so we can write for any two functions @xmath15 and @xmath30 , \\{a , b}_=amb , [ moyal_operator2 ] and note therefore that ^-1(amb)=[a , b ] .",
    "[ transform_moyal ] next we write the poisson bracket as ajb = amb [ inverse_series1 ] and , noting that = 1+^2/6 + 7 ^ 4/360-",
    " [inverse_series2 ] we obtain from ( [ transform_moyal ] ) and ( [ q_derivative2 ] ) that ^-1(ajb)=[a , b ] -([a_qq , b_pp ] -2[a_qp , b_qp ] + [ a_pp , b_qq])+o(^3 ) .",
    "[ poisson_expansion1 ] now we can answer the question raised at the end of section 2 . applying @xmath22 to both sides of ( [ poisson ] ) ,",
    "we obtain _",
    "t=[h , g ] -([h_qq , g_pp ] -2[h_qp , g_qp ] + [ h_pp , g_qq])+o(^3 ) .",
    "[ g_expansion1 ] thus we see the evolution of @xmath25 in hilbert space , which is equivalent to the classical evolution of the liouville density @xmath31 in phase space , is given as a series in ascending powers of @xmath6 .",
    "keeping successively more terms in the series , we define a sequence of approximations to the classical evolution .",
    "note that the lowest order term is just the quantum evolution , which now appears as the lowest order approximation to classical dynamics . as we add more and more terms",
    ", we have the possibility to explore the classical - quantum interface starting from the quantum side .",
    "this is completely complementary to what we normally do with semiclassical approximations to quantum mechanics .",
    "j.g . wood and",
    "i have explored semiquantum and semiclassical approximations for simple nonlinear systems with one degree of freedom @xcite . rather than hamiltonians of the form ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) , we considered @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the simple harmonic oscillator hamiltonian h_0 = p^2/2 m + m^2q^2/2 , [ sho_hamiltonian ] and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are constants .",
    "these have the advantage that they are analytically tractable , but still show characteristic differences between the classical and quantum evolutions @xcite .",
    "in particular we considered    h_2=h_0 ^ 2/e,_2= ( n^2 + n + 1/4 ) , h_3=h_0 ^ 3/e^2,_3= ^2 ( n^3 + 3n^2/2 + 2n + 3/4 ) , _ 0=(n+1/2),=/e,[hamiltonians ] with @xmath36 in each case , and @xmath37 the usual oscillator number operator .",
    "as an initial liouville density on phase space , we took a gaussian @xmath31 for which the initial groenewold operator @xmath24 equals a true density operator , namely the density operator for a pure coherent state .",
    "differences between the classical and quantum evolutions of such an initial state , with the hamiltonians @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , are immediately apparent in the phase space plots fig .",
    "[ whorl_fig ] and fig .",
    "[ quant_gaussian_fig ] . under the classical evolution",
    ", the density stays positive everywhere , but develops  whorls , \" whereas under the quantum evolution , the density ( wigner function ) becomes negative on some regions ( shown in white ) and is periodic @xcite .",
    "conversely , under the classical dynamics , the groenewold operator @xmath25 develops negative eigenvalues @xcite , whereas under the quantum evolution , such an initial pure - state density operator stays positive definite , with eigenvalues @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "simliar remarks apply with the hamiltonians @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "there is no nontrivial semiquantum or semiclassical approximation  in between \" the classical and quantum dynamics for the hamiltonians @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "each of the series ( [ star_bracket1 ] ) and ( [ g_expansion1 ] ) has just two terms in this case . for the series ( [ star_bracket1 ] ) , the leading term defines the classical evolution , and adding the next term produces the full quantum dynamics .",
    "similarly , for the series ( [ g_expansion1 ] ) , the leading term defines the quantum evolution , and adding the next term produces the full classical dynamics .    to see interesting differences",
    "betweem semiclassical and semiquantum approximations , we considered @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for which there are three terms in each of the series ( [ star_bracket1 ] ) and ( [ g_expansion1 ] ) .",
    "thus we can compare the classical evolution and the first semiclassical approximation to quantum dynamics , and also the quantum evolution and the first semiquantum approximation to classical dynamics . in fig .",
    "[ cubic ] we plot the expectation values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 in the classical and semiclassical cases , calculated at each time using the liouville density @xmath31 or the wigner function @xmath8 as in ( [ averages1 ] ) , and also the expectation values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the quantum and semiquantum cases , calculated at each time using the density operator @xmath17 or the groenewold operator @xmath25 as in ( [ g_properties ] ) . from our results",
    "it is already clear that semiquantum and semiclassical approximations provide different information about the interface between classical and quantum behaviours .",
    "these expectation values compare  classical - like \" properties of the different evolutions .",
    "we also considered  quantum - like \" properties of the diferent evolutions , in particular the largest and smallest eigenvalues of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the classical and semiclassical cases , and the largest and smallest eigenvalues of @xmath17 and @xmath25 in the quantum and semiquantum cases .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ cubic_eigenvalues ] .",
    "semiquantum mechanics opens a new window on the interface between classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "our investigations of examples as described above have not yet gone very far , but already we can say that semiquantum approximations show characteristic differences from semiclassical approximations for a given nonlinear system . more details are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to explore the nature of semiquantum approximations for other systems .",
    "for example , from the classical hamiltonian @xmath7 as in ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) , we obtain = p^2/2 m + v(q ) , [ hamiltonian2 ] and substituting in ( [ g_expansion1 ] ) , we get for the evolution of the groenewold operator in such cases _ t= [ p^2/2 m + v(q),g ] -[v(q),g_pp]+o(^3 ) , [ groenewold_evolution1 ] which is to be compared with wigner s famous formula ( [ wigner_evolution1 ] ) for the evolution of the wigner function . the implications of ( [ groenewold_evolution1 ] ) for various important choices of @xmath50 , in particular exactly solvable cases , should be examined .    of even more interest",
    "of course are systems with more degrees of freedom that show chaos at the classical level . for such systems it should be particularly interesting to consider differences in the spectral properties of @xmath25 at different times in different approximations , in classically chaotic or integrable regimes , as well as the different behaviours of expectation values of important phase space variables .",
    "we hope to investigate some of these problems .",
