    "silica aerogels are highly porous solids obtained by sol - gel process @xcite .",
    "their very open structure consists of a delicate , highly ramified backbone network of randomly interconnected thin silica strands , formed by aggregation of small silica clusters @xcite .",
    "mechanically robust , they exhibit very low densities , thermal conductivities , dielectric constants and sound velocities , as well as poor chemical reactivity and large specific areas . despite high synthesizing costs and difficulties , they have been commercially produced for civil and military use and they have found applications in thermal insulation , manufacture of materials and coatings , catalysis , gas storage and filtering , cerenkov radiation detection , etc . in science ,",
    "their unique properties make them attractive for cutting - edge studies in optics , acoustics , chemical physics , low - temperature physics , nuclear physics , space investigations , laser tests , microelectronics , electrical engineering , life sciences and bioengineering @xcite .",
    "the density and microstructure of the aerogels can be precisely controlled by adjusting the growth chemistry @xcite .",
    "this makes them particularly suited for a variety of investigations on bulk , film or layer systems in weakly confined random geometries .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to the study of phase transitions in aerogel @xcite , in particular with helium at low temperature  to probe statistical and quantum effects @xcite .",
    "the silica network provides a structural disorder background  to the fluid where it is imbedded , but occupies only a very small fraction of the sample volume .",
    "recently , extremely high ( up to 99.5% ) porosity aerogels have been used to study impurity scattering effects on unconventional pairing states in superfluid @xmath0 @xcite and changes of critical exponents in superfluid @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "strong modifications of the phase diagram occur when the correlation length of the order parameter in the fluid becomes comparable to that of aerogel .",
    "the microstructure of the samples used in the experiments must hence be characterized at the appropriate length scales , that range from nanometers ( 15@xmath580  @xmath6 in superfluid @xmath0 @xcite , 3@xmath5100  @xmath6 in superfluid @xmath4 @xcite ) to tens of microns ( mean free path , mfp , of unpaired @xmath0 quasiparticles at low pressure and temperature @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast with vycor glass or porous gold , for instance , there is no single or dominant length scale to characterize the distribution of pores and silica in aerogel .",
    "aerogel is known to be fractal at very small scales , a feature revealed both by small angle scattering ( sas ) measurements with x rays or neutrons , and computer simulations of the growth process @xcite .",
    "self - similar structures range over correlation length scales from a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers ( depending on catalysis conditions and kinetics of the gelation process ) , above which the medium appears to be fairly homogeneous .",
    "actual homogeneity at microscopic level , and relevance of a description solely based on the fractal dimension and one correlation length parameter , are  key issues for the interpretation of all physical measurements @xcite , acutely debated in the case of superfluid @xmath0 and @xmath4 in aerogel @xcite .",
    "discrepancies between experimental results are common and , most generally , tentatively attributed to unknown sample - to - sample microscopic variations ( due to growth conditions , or insufficient characterization @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , meso- or macroscopic inhomogeneities may develop during sample preparation , mounting , or use at low temperature ( due to mechanical or thermal stress @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , conventional techniques such as mercury intrusion porometry , thermoporometry , or nitrogen adsorption / desorption , are not suitable to characterize the aerogel pore structure accurately @xcite .    nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )",
    "is an established noninvasive technique to characterize porous media on a microscopic  scale @xcite .",
    "gas probes are of particular interest , because they can easily penetrate the porous matrix and exhibit fast diffusion rates that are conveniently varied over a wide range of values by pressure control .",
    "compared to other inert species , @xmath0 may be considered as an ideal candidate probe for diffusion measurements : this spin-1/2 atom has long intrinsic relaxation times , and a resonance frequency fairly insensitive to most changes of its local environment @xcite .",
    "suitable sensitivity is usually achieved using both high pressure and high magnetic field @xcite to compensate for the low density of the gas . with laser optical pumping techniques , high nuclear polarizations ( hyperpolarizations )",
    "can be achieved independently of the magnetic field strength , and very high magnetization densities are obtained even at low pressures .",
    "submillimetric imaging and diffusion measurements of hyperpolarized gases in free or confined spaces have been demonstrated both at high and low magnetic field @xcite , and used for various purposes including _ in vivo _ characterization of the lung alveolar airspaces for medical applications @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we use hyperpolarized @xmath0 nmr to non - destructively probe the void spaces in high porosity silica aerogels identical to those used in most low - temperature experiments . with probe gas mfp s ranging from a fraction of micrometer to a few tens of micrometers",
    "when pressure is varied , this technique yields a unique type of information on the structure of these materials .",
    "we had previously performed preliminary measurements on aerogel samples to test the feasibility of room temperature nmr investigations @xcite .",
    "they suggested a non - uniform distribution of density of silica strands in this system , in contrast , for instance , with the single quasiparticle mfp value obtained by spin diffusion measurements in @xmath0-@xmath4 dilute solutions @xcite . we have now undertaken a more extended investigation to confirm this result , using an improved experimental setup . in this article , we report on a systematic study over a broader range of gas pressures that has been carried out to probe several samples of custom - made and commercially produced aerogels . our former conclusions @xcite are confirmed .",
    "we show that all aerogels exhibit the same qualitative behavior , characterized by a pressure dependence of the gas diffusion coefficient that excludes a description of the aerogel by a single characteristic length .",
    "significant differences are observed between the various samples , that do not correlate with the specified aerogel porosities and may rather be associated to differences in growth conditions .",
    "we also propose a phenomenological description of gas diffusion in aerogel based on broad power - law distributions of mfp s .",
    "their main features are quantitatively derived from the nmr data analysis , and discussed on the basis of computer calculations .",
    "six samples of aerogel with 97% and 98.5% nominal porosities have been studied .",
    "one is custom made , and all others come from specialized manufacturers .",
    "sample m is a 98.5% open custom - made aerogel prepared by hydrolysis and polymerization of tetramethoxysilane , dilution in acetonitrile , gelation after addition of ammonia , and supercritical drying in an excess of solvent to preserve the delicate structure @xcite . because of the base catalyzing",
    ", the gelation process is believed to be diffusion - limited aggregation of small silica clusters ( 1@xmath53  @xmath6 in diameter ) .",
    "this type of aerogel , used in many low - temperature experiments , has been fairly characterized at small length scales using experimental ( scanning and transmission electron micrography , sem  and tem ; sas of x rays and neutrons ) and numerical ( diffusion - limited cluster aggregation , dlca , growth models ) techniques @xcite .",
    "the nanostructure of computer - generated aerogels , nicely reproducing that of real samples probed by sem / tem and sas , can be most conveniently visualized ( see , e.g. , @xcite for 2d or 3d images ) and statistically analyzed . on custom - made 98.5% samples similar to ours , sas of x rays",
    "shows a fractal - like distribution of silica extending up to a length scale of 65@xmath5100  @xmath6 @xcite , from which a purely geometrical mfp on the order of 270  @xmath6 can be calculated @xcite . in a comparable dlca model ( 98.2% porosity ) ,",
    "the very dilute aerogel structure is found to be organized so that half of the widely open volume lies farther than 10  @xmath6 from some silica , while none of it is farther than 35  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recently , path - length distributions have been analyzed in simulated aerogels using randomly sampling straight - line trajectories @xcite , and finite - size hard spheres displacements to mimic experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "the estimated @xmath0 quasiparticle mfp significantly exceeds in aerogel that of a randomly distributed medium of identical volume density ( 180 and 120  @xmath6 , respectively , for a 98.5% open sample @xcite ) .",
    "aerogel m has been grown in a cylindrical glass container ( inner diameter 12  @xmath7 , height 37  @xmath7 ) partly filled with a set of three glass tubes ( diameter 6@xmath84  @xmath7 , height 30  @xmath7 , and axes parallel to that of the container ) .",

    "viewed through these new flat ends , the aerogels are perfectly transparent and display no macroscopic flaw .",
    "all four samples are enclosed in tightly fitting pmma containers ( apart from a 0@xmath51  @xmath7 gap left open for the trapezoidal sample j@xmath14 ) .    an empty pmma container , identical to that of aerogel a ( diameter 12.5  @xmath7 , height 10.8  @xmath7 ) , is used as a reference cell for free diffusion measurements .",

    "a 0.7@xmath201.1-@xmath7 teflon tube is inserted into the tygon filling tube to reduce the dead volume .",

    "the experiment was actually performed with @xmath211 mfp s ranging from 90 to 3.5  @xmath148 ( measurements were also repeated with @xmath22 gas , for mfp s ranging between 30 and 1  @xmath148 , and a similar behavior has been observed ) .",
    "furthermore , this analysis correlated with an intriguing `` significant pore volume ( detected ) throughout the measuring range of the instrument from 2 to 200  @xmath6 '' ( by nitrogen desorption isotherm technique ) @xcite . hence , the upper and lower boundaries of the continuous pore size distribution assumed for the high porosity aerogel specimens investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite are quite comparable to those derived in the present nmr  work for @xmath0 ( self-)diffusion mfp s , using the power - law distribution model presented in section  [ section5.2 ] .",
    "in summary , laser optical pumping has been combined with low field nmr to nondestructively probe high porosity aerogel samples , by spin - echo diffusion measurements with hyperpolarized @xmath9gas .",
    "analysis of the diffusion data has been based on a statistical description of the gas motion inside the solid matrix .",
    "restricted diffusion has been related to @xmath212 mfp changes induced by interactions between the probe atoms and the sparsely distributed silica strands , a gas kinetics approach particularly suited to the widely open aerogels under study .",
    "the experimental findings are satisfactorily accounted for , assuming broad mfp s distributions inside the aerogels with ranges and power - law probability weights that are determined from the pressure dependence of the measured effective diffusion coefficients .",
    "the conclusions drawn from our study support the idea that these high porosity aerogels are not well - defined systems . it may hence contribute to cast doubt on simple models and interpretations of low - temperature physics experiments , and fosters the growing concern that they may not be ideal host media when high control of induced confinement and disorder is required .",
    "moreover , some aspects of the methodology and experimental techniques that have been used may be directly applied , or extended , to a variety of other porous systems , as follows .    in our work",
    ", a buffer gas  ( @xmath22 ) has been used to slow down @xmath0 diffusion in the aerogel void spaces , and to achieve a significant increase of the pressure measurement range .",
    "this is applicable in all systems where the gas pressure can not be increased _",
    "ad libitum_. for instance , diffusion imaging of inhaled hyperpolarized @xmath0 gas is currently used to observe in human lungs spatial variations of alveolar size related to physiology @xcite , posture @xcite , respiratory conditions @xcite , or disease @xcite .",
    "operation at atmospheric pressure being mandatory _ in vivo _ , mixing with biologically inert heavy buffer gases may be advantageously used to enhance contrast for such studies ( e.g. , @xmath213 decreases the @xmath0 diffusion coefficient by a factor up to 4 at 1 bar , depending on dilution ) but also , more generally , to reduce diffusion - weighted attenuation by encoding gradients for improved snr sensitivity and image quality @xcite .    using hyperpolarized @xmath0 ,",
    "we have been able to probe our aerogel samples over a very broad range of diffusion lengths with the same measurement  technique .",
    "this provides a powerful alternative to standard nmr approaches , often limited by technical aspects ( e.g. , acquisition rates , gradient amplitudes or ramping times ) , provided that the pressure can be directly varied by several orders of magnitude in the porous medium .",
    "application to denser silica aerogels is straightforward , but may be considered as well for other rigid porous systems allowing fast gas diffusion .",
    "for instance , diffusion measurements could be considerably extended _ in vitro _ , using fixed lungs with preserved air spaces @xcite , to bridge the gap between conflicting _ in vivo _ lung investigations performed on time scales ranging from a few milliseconds to tens of seconds ( using gradient echo @xcite , spin echo @xcite and spin tagging @xcite techniques ) , and to clear up  the link between @xmath0 nmr data and airways structural characteristics @xcite .",
    "laser polarization of the probe gas actually yields high snrs to perform highly accurate nmr measurements in a variety of model systems ( single pores @xcite , rocks @xcite or packed glass beads @xcite ) .",
    "the technique yet requires that a sufficiently large nuclear polarization is preserved inside the porous medium .",
    "this potentially limits the type of materials that can be probed , at least in the static mode operated here .",
    "however , for materials with moderately low specific relaxation times , continuous flow techniques can be used to maintain a suitable stationary magnetization , through replenishment by freshly polarized gas .",
    "most demonstrations involve hyperpolarized xenon gas so far @xcite , but flow measurements are also very easy to perform with the compact @xmath0 gas production system described in section  [ section2.3 ] .    finally , a specific interest of operation at low magnetic field may be emphasized .",
    "interpretation of nmr diffusion data is known to crucially depend on adequate background gradient compensation , but also on the predominance of applied gradients over internal ones . in our work ,",
    "local - field inhomogeneities due to the aerogel matrix were irrelevant for the analysis of the measurements . but nmr studies with hyperpolarized gas are highly sensitive , and they may equally reveal weak bulk magnetic susceptibility effects ( e.g. , the influence of glass containers at high field @xcite ) or artifacts generated by dominant susceptibility - induced field gradients  ( e.g. , in ventilation imaging at 1.5 @xmath214 @xcite ) .",
    "operation at low or ultralow field can be very helpful to separate the effects of applied and local gradients for improved quantitative understanding in complex porous systems , as recently demonstrated in lungs @xcite .",
    "sample m has been kindly prepared for us by norbert mulders in moses chan s laboratory at pennstate university .",
    "similar custom - made aerogels are used for low - temperature experiments at upenn , cornell and northwestern universities , and several other places .",

    "the probe atoms are strongly confined inside the aerogel , but diffuse freely ( hence , much faster ) in these void spaces .",
    "if the contribution of such diffusion `` shunts '' to the spin - echo attenuation is significant , the global effective coefficient @xmath147 extracted from the nmr data must differ from that of the bulk aerogel .",
    "shunt effects are quantitatively assessed , and discussed as a function of the volume fraction of open void spaces .",
    "the second section provides examples of computed effective diffusion coefficients in bulk aerogel , for a few kinds of broad mfp distributions .",
    "results are successively presented for gaussian , bimodal , and exponential distributions .",
    "they contrast strongly with those obtained with the power - law distributions used in the article , that satisfactorily describe the experimental diffusion data .",
    "experimentally , the void spaces open to @xmath0 diffusion may be large cracks that have developed inside the aerogel samples , or gaps between the bulk material and the container walls for aerogel samples that do not fill up the whole cell volume .",
