    "finding analytic means of calculating details of the energy spectrum of strongly interacting many - body systems has long been a goal of theoretical physics , with applications from low energy scales in condensed matter physics to high energy particle physics . in particular",
    ", accurate calculations of the ground state energy are important to settle issues relating to the character of the ground state , or vacuum state , itself .",
    "while there has arisen a range of theoretical tools to tackle problems that can not be treated by perturbation theory , many suffer from the effects of uncontrolled approximation to the extent that each , alone can not be trusted to give a reliable answer .",
    "it is only when several independent methods point in the same direction , that one can confidently state something about the character of a system .",
    "examples include mean field theories neglecting correlations in fluctuations thereby reinforcing a tendency to order ; exact diagonalisation and monte - carlo studies , at zero temperature , on relatively small clusters and the extrapolation to the bulk limit ; finite temperature monte - carlo simulation of somewhat larger systems , but at temperatures above the interesting low energy scales .    in this paper",
    "a simple fundamental relationship is found between the tri - diagonal form of the hamiltonian and the ground state energy density .",
    "a general theorem is proved for the ground state energy density in terms of the coefficients generated by the lanczos method , evaluated in a limiting process incorporating convergence of the lanczos iterates and the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the lanczos method is based on the following recursion : starting from an appropriate trial state , one recursively generates new basis states with repeated application of the hamiltonian @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . at the @xmath5th iteration of this recursion",
    "the hamiltonian matrix in the new basis of states is given by the tri - diagonal , @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the power of the lanczos phenomenon is that the dimension of the tri - diagonal basis , required to describe the low - lying states of the system , determined by the recursion level is significantly smaller than the original basis .",
    "the outermost eigenvalues of @xmath11 rapidly converge to those of the hamiltonian . in computing the lanczos coefficients , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , exactly one",
    "is usually restricted to an early termination of the recursion in the analytic case treating large systems , or to small systems in a numerical calculation taken to complete convergence . to date all methods ,",
    "however the lanczos basis has been generated , require the numerical diagonalisation of the tri - diagonal @xmath11 matrices for the ground state energy . in this paper we will demonstrate how the diagonalisation can be carried out analytically for extensive systems , thereby providing a solution for the ground state energy density in terms of the tri - diagonal form . by introducing a new parameter , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the size of the system , the asymptotic forms @xmath2 and @xmath3 are related to the ground state energy by @xmath17 \\ .\\ ] ]",
    "using the initial state , @xmath18 , one forms hamiltonian moments , and from these the connected moments , @xmath19 the connected moments encapsulate the essential physics of the system because they scale with the size of the system , @xmath6 , as @xmath20 here @xmath6 is a quantitative measure of the size of the system whether it be the number of sites in a lattice of localised spins , or the volume in a continuum model with itinerant particles .",
    "although this form is restricted to the ground state or vacuum sector of the model , generalisations can be easily made to excited states .",

    "the connection between the lanczos tri - diagonal form of the hamiltonian and the associated system of orthogonal polynomials is simple .",
    "the characteristic polynomial @xmath32 of the lanczos tri - diagonal matrix representation satisfies the following recursion relation : @xmath33 which in turn defines @xmath34 as an orthogonal polynomial , the zeros of which are the eigenvalues of the @xmath11 matrices .",
    "the analytic forms for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 define a special class of orthogonal polynomials relevant to the many - body problem which are distinguished by a certain dependence on the size parameter @xmath6 .    for the orthogonal polynomials",
    "@xmath35 satisfying the recursion relation @xmath36 there exits a powerful theorem by van doorn@xcite on the lower bound on the lowest zero which has been generalised by ismail and li@xcite to include an upper bound to the largest zero . simply stated ismail and li s result is the following : if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the smallest and largest zeros respectively of @xmath39 with @xmath40 then they are bounded by the interval @xmath41 where @xmath42 and the bound sequence is given by @xmath43.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression for @xmath44 , @xmath45 is a chain sequence .",

    "only a technical difference occurs with this theorem in that @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    for finite @xmath6",
    "the termination of the lanczos recursion occurs at some @xmath55 when the sector of hilbert space , determined by the trial state , has been exhausted . in general the basis of states",
    "grows faster than any linear enumeration with @xmath6 .",
    "taking the minimum of @xmath56 to occur at some @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , the asymptotic forms for @xmath0 and @xmath1 give the leading order behaviour of the lowest energy level as @xmath59.\\ ] ] since @xmath60 , to maximise the rhs of the above expression with respect to the chain sequence we may choose the maximal constant chain sequence@xcite @xmath61 we can now obtain the ground state energy density , @xmath62 , in the bulk limit : @xmath63 in the @xmath28 limit , we also have @xmath64 giving @xmath65 , and it is straightforward to establish that in general @xmath66 is obtained by finding the greatest lower bound with respect to @xmath29 . the ground state energy density of the general extensive many - body problem in the bulk limit",
    "is therefore @xmath67.\\ ] ]",
    "as a first illustration of this exact analytic diagonalisation of extensive systems we consider the purely mathematical model defined by the tri - diagonal form @xmath68 the lowest eigenvalue in the @xmath28 limit is @xmath69 = \\left({r\\over 2}\\right)^{r/(1-r)}\\,\\left(1-r\\right ) + 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 .",
    "the minimum occurs at @xmath71 .",
    "it is a straightforward matter to numerically diagonalise this system for increasing @xmath6 to demonstrate the convergence of the numerical results to the analytic expression .",
    "the results of this exercise are shown in figure 1 ( for a typical case @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) where we plot the error , defined as the difference from the exact value , of numerical diagonalisations for increasing @xmath6 .",
    "the approach to the analytic solution is clear as @xmath28 .",
    "secondly we compare the the analytic diagonalisation with numerical results using the truncated lanczos coefficients given by the plaquette expansion .",
    "we do this here for the case of the anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg chain , for which the expansions have been derived to high order using the classical @xmath74 state as the trial state .",
    "this state is an poor choice for the isotropic heisenberg model but is sufficiently simple to allow the computation of moments up to @xmath75 . employing the traditional analysis of the plaquette expansion",
    "the @xmath11 matrices are diagonalised numerically for increasing chain size @xmath6@xcite . in figures 2 and 3",
    "we demonstrate the approach of the numerical diagonalisation for the ground state to the analytic expression as the @xmath28 limit is approached .",
    "we show the two typical cases which can occur due to the truncation of the expansions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "figure 2 corresponds to an order of the plaquette expansion for which @xmath76 has no minimum  a point of inflection develops , reflecting the fact that the expansion naturally breaks down at some large enough value of @xmath29 .",
    "figure 3 shows a case where a minimum develops  the numerical values for the lowest eigenvalue in the large volume limit match onto the value of at the minimum .",
    "we must emphasis that the plaquette expansion is a series expansion of the exact lanczos coefficients about @xmath77 and truncated , and is therefore only reliable for small @xmath29 .",
    "the error involved grows rapidly with @xmath29 which can occur with either sign , and thus the large @xmath29 behaviour of the truncated approximations bear no relation to the exact behaviour .",
    "because of this we do nt expect that at every order at which the truncation is made , that a minima would arise .",
    "we have found an expression for the ground state energy density for the extensive many - body problem which is completely general and , since the hamiltonian was diagonalised exactly , is non - perturbative .",
    "given the hamiltonian in tri - diagonal form the expression can be used immediately .",
    "so far , the exact analytic transformation of a system to tri - diagonal form has not been achieved for any examples of solvable systems .",
    "this state of affairs may change as the theorem proved here gives impetus to efforts in this direction .",
    "however , an immediate approximate tri - diagonalisation of the general problem does exist in the plaquette expansion and studies of the usefulness of this method with better trial states also merits further work .",
    "the analytic nature of this expansion uncovered the existence of the scaled lanczos iteration parameter @xmath78 and the asymptotic forms @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the exact problem .",
    "an interesting extension of this work is to consider a similar analysis on excited states .",
    "an indication that the solution for the mass - gap of the general extensive many - body system may in fact be possible is the fact that the mass - gap of the first order plaquette expansion has already been solved analytically@xcite .",
    "such a generalisation is presently under active investigation .",
