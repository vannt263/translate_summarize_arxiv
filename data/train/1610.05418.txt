    "heavy flavor physics may provide many details of the standard model , such as information of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , the intrinsic structure of the strong interaction , the possible evidences of new physics beyond the standard model , and so on .",
    "investigation of heavy @xmath4 or @xmath5 mesons or baryons appeals much interest both in experiment and theory .",
    "there are many research work on the @xmath0 baryon in the past years . in experiments , data of the process",
    "@xmath6 have been presented and improved in fairly good accuracy .",
    "early in 2013 the bell collaboration at kekb measured the first model independent branching ratio @xmath7@xcite .",
    "this measurement improved the precision of the absolute branching ratios of other decay modes of the @xmath0 baryon .",
    "next in 2015 the besiii collaboration reported the first absolute measurement of the branching ratio of the semileptonic decay process @xmath8@xcite . later in 2016 ,",
    "the besiii collaboration gives the improvement of the @xmath0 decay modes , including the process @xmath9@xcite .",
    "many theoretical analysis have been devoted to the topic , including the covariant quark model@xcite , the light - cone qcd sum rules@xcite , the su(3 ) flavor symmety@xcite , the relativistic quark model@xcite , and other models@xcite .    from the quark level , there are two main modes in the heavy - light semiletonic decay channels of the c - quark - contained baryon in the tree level , which are @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , they correspond to the final baryons @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the case of the @xmath0 baryon decay modes . it is known that the decay amplitude is suppressed by the ckm matrix element @xmath14 , so the decay rate of the mode @xmath15 is expected to be much smaller than that of @xmath16 due to the fact @xmath17 .",
    "it may be the main reason that this mode is not measured experimentally yet to date .",
    "however , the lifetime of the neutron is much larger than that of the @xmath12 baryon , so it may be expected to test the process more accurately in experiment in spite of its small decay rate .    in the fundamental particle level",
    ", the process @xmath1 can be divided into two parts . on the hadron side , we need to consider the weak decay process @xmath11 via the @xmath18 boson , while on the lepton side the @xmath18 boson decays into @xmath19 . in calculations with",
    "effective theory , the leptonic part can be calculated with conventional field method , while the hadron part , which is generally parameterized to form factors , need to be analyzed with the consideration of the nonperturbative effect .",
    "light - cone qcd sum rules is a useful nonperturbative method@xcite . when starting from the correlation function which is the matrix element of the current - current interaction between vacuum and the final state , the decay quark fields are contracted , while the other ones between the vacuum and the final state can be expanded on the light - cone , which is related to the nonperturbative effect of the qcd .",
    "generally the nonperturbative effect can be parameterized with some general functions which do not rely on any specific processes .",
    "we call these functions light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "light - cone distribution amplitudes denote the distribution of the hadron momentum on the partial particles .",
    "therefore , the prediction with this method depends on the precision of the light - cone distribution amplitudes of the related particle .",
    "the light - cone distribution amplitudes of the neutron has been examined for a long time . since the beginning of this century",
    ", many efforts have been devoted into the light - cone distribution amplitudes of the nucleon @xcite and the strange octet baryons@xcite .",
    "it is referred the paper @xcite for detailed overview .",
    "these lcdas have been well used in analyzing the qcd related processes of the baryons@xcite and give fairly accurate predictions .",
    "the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : sumrule ] is devoted to the derivation of the sum rules of the weak decay form factors . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , the sum rules are analyzed numerically and the main results are presented in this section .",
    "a brief summary is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the effective hamitonian of the weak decay process @xmath1 is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fermi constant , @xmath22 is the ckm matrix element , @xmath23 , @xmath5 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the field operators of the @xmath23 , @xmath5 , @xmath26 and @xmath25 particles . the main aim of this paper is to deal with the hadronic part which can be parameterized to the heavy - light quark transition form factors .    in accordance to the standard procedure of the light - cone qcd sum rules ,",
    "the derivation of the sum rules of the form factors starts from the following two - point correlation function between vacuum and the final state @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the current to interpolate the @xmath0 baryon and @xmath30 is the current to describe the weak interaction in the quark level . in this paper",
    "we use the current defined on the light - cone to interpolate the @xmath0 baryon field @xmath31 the coupling constant of the baryon is defined by the matrix element of the interpolating current ( [ intcurrent ] ) between the vacuum and the baryon state : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the light - cone vector with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 determines the normalization of the leading twist neutron distribution amplitude .    considering the quantum numbers of the baryons and the lorentz structure of the current , the weak transition form factors of the @xmath0 to the neutron are defined as follows : @xmath36n(p).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the form factors , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the spinors of @xmath0 and the neutron , respectively . on the hadronic level ,",
    "the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) is calculated by inserting a complete set of baryon states which have the same quantum numbers as @xmath0 . by using the transition invariance and integrating the coordinate variables ,",
    "the hadronic part is obtained as @xmath41n(p)+ ... ,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath42 denotes the resonance and continuum contributions .",
    "the form factors @xmath43 and @xmath44 vanish in the representation due to the conservation of the vector current .    on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) can be calculated by being expanded on the light - cone @xmath34 . with the light - cone distribution amplitudes presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) is calculated on the qcd level as @xmath45    in the above results , the abbreviates are used as : @xmath46 where the distribution amplitudes with a ",
    "tilde \" are defined as @xmath47    next , considering the quark - hadron duality and the borel transformation , the two representations are matched to get the sum rules of the form factors . in the processes",
    "the following formula are used : @xmath48e^{-s_0/m_b^2},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the final sum rules of the form factors are @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "the most important inputs in the light - cone qcd sum rules are the light - cone distribution amplitudes of the hadron . in the following analysis",
    ", we use the definitions and the nonperturbative parameters presented in refs .",
    "we do not show them explicitly in the paper , and those interested in the contents are referred to the references above .",
    "there are still some other parameters which need to be determined . in the numerical analysis",
    ", we adopt the masses of the charm quark , the neurton and the @xmath0 baryon as @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the coupling constant @xmath35 defined in eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) is another important parameter to be determined . in the following analysis we use the estimate obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , to derive the sum rules , two artificial parameters , the continuous threshold @xmath57 and the borel mass @xmath58 , are introduced .",
    "the threshold @xmath57 is the parameter to be used to represent the continuous contribution by integrating the spectral density in the area above it . in the viewpoint of the physical content",
    ", the threshold is related to the first excited state of the considered hadron , the neutron .",
    "additionally , the result should not depend on the threshold two much . in the work ,",
    "we choose the value in the region @xmath59 .",
    "another parameter , the borel mass , is determined with the requirement that both higher twist contributions and higher resonance contributions are suppressed , and the sum rules do not depend on the borel mass too much in the working region simultaneously .",
    "making use of the light - cone distribution amplitudes presented in ref.@xcite , we show the dependence of the form factors on the borel parameter at the squared momentum transfer @xmath60 in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "the results indicate that in this window the sum rules meet the above requirement and are plat on the borel parameter .",
    "we plot the @xmath61 dependence of the form factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 with the borel mass being chosen as @xmath64 in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "when calculating the correlation function in the quark level , we need expand it on the light - cone . the higher twist contribution is suppressed by a factor @xmath65 compared with the lower twist one .",
    "therefore the expansion is only reliable in the region where @xmath66 is large enough . in other words ,",
    "the sum rules can only be used in some range of the momentum transfer . in order to get the form factors in the whole dynamical region , we fit the sum rules with the dipole formula @xmath67 tab .",
    "[ fit ] presents the fitting values of the coefficients with the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 . with the fitted coefficients ,",
    "the form factors can be extrapolated to the whole dynamic region .    .",
    "the dipole formula fit for the form factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the semileptonic decay of the @xmath0 baryon is a useful channel to test the standard model and the intrinsic structure of the strong interaction .",
    "considering the recent development in experiment on the decay modes of @xmath0 , we investigate the weak transition form factors of the channel @xmath1 in the framework of light - cone qcd sum rules .",
    "we present the form factors on the momentum transfer in the region where the sum rules are valid .",
    "furthermore , we fit the form factors with dipole formula and extrapolate them into the whole dynamic region .",
    "the differential decay width is presented in the whole dynamic region with the fitted parameters .",
    "the total decay width is obtained by integrating the differential decay width in the dynamic range @xmath70 to be @xmath2 and the branching ratio is estimate in aid of the mean life time of the @xmath0 baryon to be @xmath3 .",
    "the results show that this decay mode is fairly large and deserved to be measured in experiments .",
