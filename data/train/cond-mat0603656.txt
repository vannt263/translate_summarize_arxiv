    "the instability results from the interaction between the sand bed profile , which modifies the fluid velocity field , and the flow that modifies in turn the sand bed as it transport grains .",
    "let us consider a flat and symmetric bump as that shown in figure  [ instabilitymechanism ] .",
    "the fluid is accelerated on the upwind ( stoss ) side and decelerated on the downwind side .",
    "this is schematized by the flow lines in this figure : they are closer to each other above the bump .",
    "this results in an increase of the shear stress @xmath11 applied by the flow on the stoss side of the bump .",
    "conversely , @xmath11 decreases on the lee side . assuming that the maximum amount of sand that can be transported by a given flow  the _ saturated _ sand flux ",
    "is an increasing function of @xmath11 , erosion takes place on the stoss slope as the flux increases , and sand is deposited on the lee of the bump .",
    "if the velocity field was symmetric around the bump , the transition between erosion and deposition would be exactly at the crest , and this would lead to a pure propagation of the bump , without any change in amplitude ( we call this the ` @xmath12 ' effect , see below ) .",
    "in fact , due to the simultaneous effects of inertia and dissipation ( viscous or turbulent ) , the velocity field is asymmetric ( even on a symmetrical bump ) and the position of the maximum shear stress is shifted upwind the crest of the bump ( the ` @xmath13 ' effect ) .",
    "in addition , the sand transport reaches its saturated value with a spatial lag , characterized by the saturation length @xmath4 .",
    "the maximum of the sand flux @xmath14 is thus shifted downwind the point at which @xmath11 is maximum by a typical distance of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the criterion of instability is then geometrically related to the position at which the flux is maximum with respect to the top of the bump : an up - shifted position leads to a deposition of grains before the crest , so that the bump grows .    the above qualitative arguments can be translated into a precise mathematical framework , see e.g. @xcite . for a small deformation of the bed profile @xmath15 , the excess of stress induced by a non - flat profile can be written in fourier space as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the shear that would apply on a flat bed and @xmath18 is the wave vector associated to the spatial coordinate @xmath19 . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are dimensionless functions of all parameters and of @xmath18 in particular .",
    "the @xmath12 part is in phase with the bed profile , whereas the @xmath13 one is out of phase , so that the modes of @xmath20 and @xmath11 of wavelength @xmath0 have a spatial phase difference of the order of @xmath21 .",
    "this shift is typically of the order of @xmath22 of the length of the bump as @xmath12 and @xmath13 are typically of the same order of magnitude .",
    "expressions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 have been derived by jackson and hunt @xcite in the case of a turbulent flow . as shown by kroy _",
    "@xcite , @xmath12 and @xmath13 only weakly ( logarithmically ) depend on the wavelength so that they can be considered as constant for practical purpose .",
    "if the shear stress is below the dynamical threshold @xmath23 , no transport is observed , hence the sand flux is null . above this threshold ,",
    "one observes on a flat bed a saturated flux @xmath24 which is a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the fact that a wind of a given strength can only transport a finite quantity of sand is due to the negative feedback of the grains transported by the fluid on the flow velocity profile ",
    "the moving grains slow down the fluid .",
    "this saturation process of the sand flux is still a matter of research @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a review discussion . for our present purpose , we need a first order but quantitative description of the saturated flux . following @xcite , rasmussen _",
    "wind tunnel data @xcite are well described by the relationship : @xmath25 @xmath26 is gravitational acceleration .",
    "the prefactor @xmath27 has been adjusted to fit the data and is reasonably independent of the grain size @xmath6 .",
    "the equivalent of the relation ( [ tau ] ) for the saturated flux on a modulated surface @xmath28 can then be written as @xmath29 where , by the use of relation ( [ qdetau ] ) , the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 simply verify @xmath32 .    as for any approach to an equilibrium state , there exists a relaxation length  or equivalently a relaxation time  scale associated with the sand flux saturation .",
    "this was already mentioned by bagnold who measured the spatial lag needed by the flux to reach its saturated value on a flat sand patch @xcite .",
    "a saturation length @xmath4 in dune models has been first introduced by sauermann _",
    "@xcite , where the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath11 and in particular its divergence as @xmath33 has been put phenomenologically in the description . in fact , the saturation length should _ a priori _",
    "depend on the mode of transport  at least we are sure that it must exist in all the situations where there is an equilibrium transport . as there can be different mechanisms responsible for a lag before saturation ( delay to accelerate the grain to the fluid velocity , delay due to the sedimentation of a transported grain @xcite , delay due to the progressive ejection of grains during collisions , delay for the negative feedback of the transport on the wind , delay for electrostatic effects between the transported grains and the soil , etc ) , the dynamics is dominated by the slowest mechanism so that @xmath4 is the largest among the different possible relaxation lengths . in the aeolian turbulent case , there exists a detailed theoretical analysis @xcite providing the dependence of the saturation length on the shear velocity ( @xmath34 in figure  [ lsat ] ) .",
    "the curve roughly presents two zones . very close to the threshold , the slowest process is the ejection of grains during collision .",
    "it is thus natural to have a divergence of the saturation length at the threshold @xcite as the replacement capacity crosses @xmath35 ( see the calculation of the dynamical threshold in appendix ) .",
    "from just above the threshold ",
    "say for @xmath36  the saturation length gently increases ( roughly linearly ) with @xmath37 .",
    "however , in the field , the mean wind strength varies from day to day , as seasons goes by . for practical purposes   e.g. photograph analysis   it is thus of fundamental importance to define an effective saturation length , independent of the wind velocity",
    ". fortunately , the velocity rarely exceeds @xmath38 , so that , in the range of interest , the velocity dependence on @xmath4 is subdominant .",
    "our first important conclusion is thus that even though it should be remembered that @xmath4 slightly depends on @xmath39 in lab experiments , the dominant parameters are the grain size @xmath6 and the sand to fluid density ratio .",
    "the theoretical analysis @xcite shows that @xmath4 scales on the drag length @xmath40 , which is the length needed for a grain in saltation to be accelerated to the fluid velocity .",
    "it is worth noting that this inertial effect is however _ not _ the mechanism limiting the saturation process ( see above )",
    ". using the results of a field experiment performed in the atlantic sahara of morocco @xcite , the prefactor between @xmath4 and @xmath3 can be computed and gives : @xmath41 this result is also consistent with bagnold s data @xcite .",
    "note that the saturation length has never been measured directly in other situations ( neither under water nor in high / low pressure wind tunnels ) .",
    "the linear stability analysis of the coupled differential equations of this framework has been performed in @xcite . in particular , the wavenumber corresponding to the maximum growth rate is given by @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{kmax}\\ ] ] for typical values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 determined in the barchan dune context @xcite , we have @xmath43 . note that we have @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 is independent of @xmath17 and @xmath23 . using measurements in water ( subaqueous ripples ) , in air ( aeolian dunes ) and in the co@xmath2 atmosphere of mars and of the venus wind tunnel ,",
    "we now investigate the scaling relation between @xmath46 and @xmath3 .",
    "to do so , we need to first solve the controversy concerning the size of saltating grains on mars .",
    "the determination of the typical size of the grains participating to saltation on martian dunes is a challenging issue .",
    "first , the dunes seem to evolve very slowly or may even have become completely static .",
    "second , no sample of the matter composing the bulk of the dunes is available .",
    "third , we do know from the observation of dunes on earth that they can be covered by larger grains that do not participate to the transport in saltation . with the two rovers opportunity and spirit",
    ", we now have direct visualisations of the soil @xcite , and in particular of clear aeolian structures like ripples or nabkhas .",
    "unfortunately , these structures did not lie on the surface of a dune .",
    "we thus analyze the available photographs , assuming that , like on earth , the size of the grains participating in saltation does not vary much from place to place .",
    "the photographs freely accessible online are not of sufficiently good resolution to determine the shape and the size of each grain composing the surface .",
    "besides , one has to be careful when analyzing such pictures as part of what is visible at the surface corresponds to grains just below it and partly hidden by their neighbours .",
    "we have thus specifically developed a method to determine the average grain size in zones where the grains are reasonably monodispersed , when the resolution is typically larger than @xmath47 pixels per grain diameter .",
    "this measure can be deduced from the computation of the auto - correlation function @xmath48 of the picture , which decreases typically over one grain size .",
    "more precisely , we proceed with the following procedure : + @xmath34 the zones covered by anything but sand ( e.g. gravels or isolated larger grains ) are localized and excluded from the analysis .",
    "+ @xmath34 because in natural conditions the light is generally inhomogeneous , we perform a local smoothing of the picture with a gaussian kernel of radius @xmath49 .",
    "the resulting picture is subtracted from the initial one .",
    "+ @xmath34 we compute the local standard deviation of this image difference with the same gaussian kernel and produce , after normalisation , a third picture @xmath50 of null local average and of standard deviation unity .",
    "+ @xmath34 the auto - correlation function @xmath48 is computed on this resulting picture , averaging over all directions : @xmath51    figure [ granulo]a shows the curve @xmath48 obtained from a series of photographs of aeolian sand sampled on a terrestrial dune .",
    "for all the resolutions used ( between @xmath35 and @xmath52  pix/@xmath6 ) , the data collapse on a single curve , which is thus characteristic of the sand sample .",
    "the top inset shows the distribution of size , weighted in mass , in log - log representation .",
    "it presents a narrow peak around the @xmath53 value .",
    "the autocorrelation function decreases from @xmath35 to @xmath54 over a size of the order of @xmath53 ( lorenzian fit ) .",
    "this is basically due to the fact that the color or the gray level at two points are only correlated if they are inside the same grain .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the autocorrelation curve is a function of @xmath55 only . as a matter of fact",
    ", photographs of two samples of comparable polydispersity are similar once rescaled by the mean grain diameter .",
    "we will thus use the curve obtained with aeolian sand sampled on earth as a reference to determine the size of martian grains .",
    "figure  [ granulo]b shows the autocorrelation curve obtained from the colour image taken by the rover spirit at its landing site .",
    "@xmath48 decreases faster than the reference curve but by tuning the value of the martian @xmath53 , one can superimpose the mars data with the solid line fairly well . from this picture as well as a series of gray level photographs taken by the rover opportunity , we have estimated the diameter of the grains composing these aeolian formations to @xmath56 m .",
    "the first measurement of martian grain sizes dates back to the viking mission in the 70s .",
    "on the basis of thermal diffusion coefficient measurements , edgett and christensen have estimated the grain diameter to be around @xmath57 m and at least larger than those composing dunes on earth @xcite .",
    "this size corresponds to larger grains than saltons such as those shown in the top inset of figure  [ granulo]b . in agreement with our findings , wind tunnel experiments performed in",
    "` martian conditions ' @xcite have shown that grains around @xmath58 m are the easiest to dislodge from the bed .",
    "we shall come back to this point later on .",
    "several theoretical investigations of the size of aeolian martian grains have been conducted , starting with the work of sagan and bagnold @xcite . in that paper",
    "the authors argue that , as mars is a very arid planet , the cohesion forces due to humidity can be neglected and proposed a cohesion - free computation which predicts that very small grains ( typically of one micron ) may be put into saltation .",
    "miller and komar @xcite also followed this cohesion - free approach and proposed static threshold curves with no turnup on small particle size .",
    "it was soon realized that cohesion forces can occur for reasons other than humidity   namely van der waals forces   and several authors proposed ( static ) transport threshold curves with a peaked minimum around @xmath58 m @xcite . however in these papers , cohesion is treated in an empirical fashion , with the assumption that van der waals forces lead to an attractive force proportional to the grain diameter with a prefactor independent of @xmath6 .",
    "we have recomputed the martian transport diagram ( figure  [ shieldsmars ] ) using a new derivation of the transport thresholds .",
    "it takes into account the hysteresis between the static and dynamic thresholds , the effect of viscosity and   in a more rigorous way   the effect of cohesion . as this derivation , although consequent and original , is not the central purpose of the present paper which is devoted to the test of the dune scaling law , we have developed and discussed it in appendix .",
    "we wish to solely discuss here the figure  [ shieldsmars ] , which is useful to prove that the @xmath59 m sized grains can be transported in saltation .",
    "the first striking feature of the martian transport diagram is the huge hysteresis between the dynamic and static thresholds .",
    "compared to aeolian transport on earth ( figure  [ shieldswaterair ] in the appendix ) for which the static threshold is typically @xmath60 above the dynamic threshold , they are separated on mars by a factor larger than @xmath47 .",
    "quantitatively , if the static threshold is very high compared to the typical wind velocities on mars ( @xmath61 km/h at @xmath62 m above the soil ) , the dynamical threshold is only of the order of @xmath63 km/h at @xmath62 m . from images by the mars orbiter camera ( moc ) of reversing dust streaks , jerolmack _",
    "_ @xcite have estimated that modern surface winds can reach velocities as large as @xmath64  km / h .",
    "looking at figure  [ shieldsmars ] , it can be seen that at such velocities , most of the grain below @xmath58 m can be suspended and that even millimetric grains can be entrained into saltation . even in less stormy conditions",
    ", sand transport should not be as unfrequent as one could expect , even though the large amplitude of the hysteresis implies an intermittency of sand transport .",
    "this suggests that martian dunes are definitively active .",
    "keeping in mind that the wavelength @xmath0 that spontaneously appears when a flat sand bed is destabilized by a turbulent flow scales on the flux saturation length , the aim of the paper is to plot @xmath0 against @xmath3 in the different situations mentioned in the introduction : aqueous ripples , waves on aeolian dunes , both on earth and mars , fresh snow dunes and microdunes in the venus wind tunnel  numerical values of the parameters corresponding to these different situations are summarized in table [ tab_compare ] .",
    ".comparison of different quantities ( gravity @xmath26 , initial wavelength of bed instability @xmath0 , diameter of saltons @xmath6 as well as fluid and sediment densities @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) in the air ( earth ) , in the martian and venus wind tunnel co@xmath2 atmospheres and in water . as the temperature at the surface of mars can vary by an amplitude of typically @xmath67  k between warm days and cold nights , the density of the atmosphere displays some variation range .",
    "[ tab_compare ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our reference data point in figure [ dunes_scalingmtw ] ( aeolian dunes on earth ) has been obtained after an extensive work on barchan dunes in the atlantic sahara of morocco . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that perturbations such as wind changes generate waves at the surface of dunes by the linear instability described above .",
    "direct measurements of the wavelength are reported in figure  [ histo]a in an histogram .",
    "they give @xmath68  m for waves on the flanks of medium sized dunes ( solid line ) and @xmath69  m on the windward side of a mega - barchan ( dashed line ) , where some pattern coarsening occurs .",
    "m was measured independently in the same dune field , and these aeolian grains of @xmath71 m lead to a drag length of @xmath72  cm .",
    "the study of small scale barchans under water @xcite provides the second data point : measurements give @xmath73  cm with glass beads of size @xmath74 m , a size which leads to a drag length of @xmath75 m .",
    "this point is the only one in the literature for which it is specified that : ( i ) the wavelength has been measured during the linear stage of the instability ; ( ii ) the sand bed destabilizes in a homogeneous way and not starting at the entrance of the set - up , due to strong disturbances there ; ( iii ) the height of the tank is much larger than the wavelength .",
    "we have added three other underwater points in figure  [ dunes_scalingmtw ] , from coleman and melville s data @xcite.the slight discrepancy with the straight line ( these points are all above the line ) can be explained by the three points risen above : it may be induced from @xcite that ( i ) the initial stage is not clearly resolved ; ( ii ) the waves seem to nucleate on defects as if the transition was sub - critical ; ( iii ) the flume is only @xmath76  m deep , a height which is comparable to the observed wavelengths .",
    "recent photos of martian dunes @xcite such as that in figure  [ comparmarsterre ] lead to an estimate of the value of @xmath77  m on mars .",
    "we focused on the dunes found in craters of the southern hemisphere . for comparison ,",
    "we have measured wavelengths on dunes in several craters ( e.g. rabe , russell , kaiser , proctor , hellespontus ) and also produced a histogram restricted to kaiser crater , see figure  [ histo]b . as for the drag length",
    ", we used the value for the grain diameter estimated in the previous section .",
    "the density of martian grains is similar to or slightly higher @xcite than that of terrestrial grains .",
    "the value of the density of the martian atmosphere however varies within some range as the temperature on mars surface can change by an amplitude of typically @xmath67  k between warm days and cold nights . in the end",
    ", it gives a value of @xmath3 between @xmath78 and @xmath79  m.    the fourth data point is obtained from greeeley et al.s experiment in a high pressure co2 wind tunnel @xcite , which gives for @xmath3 a value we expect on venus .",
    "the observed wavelength first decreases from @xmath80 cm to @xmath81 cm with the wind speed from @xmath82 to @xmath83 and then increases up to @xmath84 cm at @xmath85 . above this value",
    ", the flat sand bed was again found to be stable . although some of these features are reminiscent of the @xmath4 curve discussed above ( figure  [ lsat ] ) , this series of experiments is also questionable : nothing is reported about the nature of the destabilization ( homogeneous appearance of the pattern or not ) nor on the maturity of the pattern when the wavelength was measured ( coarsening ? ) .",
    "remarkably , the crude averaged of the provided data lies on the master curve , even though the smallest wavelength is less than half the predicted value .    as for the venus wind tunnel ,",
    "the fifth data points are not very precise and correspond to fresh snow dunes formed on antartic sea ice and on baltic sea ice .",
    "the typical wavelength @xmath0 of transverse dunes ( for instance in figure  [ barchans_snow]*(a ) * ranges from @xmath86  m to @xmath27  m @xcite . whenever barchan dunes form , they are typically @xmath52  m to @xmath87  m long and are separated by @xmath88  m ( see figure  [ barchans_snow]*(b)*. this is very similar with aeolian ones , although snow barchan dunes look more elongated .",
    "the determination of @xmath3 is more problematic as the snow density rapidly increases once fallen .",
    "snow dunes are rather rare and probably form only at the surface of ice by strong wind , when the snow can remain fresh and not very cohesive . to get the numbers , we have used the measurements performed close to the antartic dunes by massom _",
    "although one may find somehow disappointing that on the graph of figure  [ dunes_scalingmtw ] these data points are located very close to the aeolian sand dunes , they are particularly interesting as they show that one can keep the same @xmath0 by changing simultaneously @xmath66 and @xmath6 in a compensating way .    globally , we obtain a consistent scaling law @xmath89 that covers almost five decades ( figure  [ dunes_scalingmtw ] ) .",
    "we wish to emphasize again that we do not claim to capture all the dependences on this plot , but that @xmath3 is the dominant scaling factor .",
    "as shown in figure  [ lsat ] , we expect subdominant dependences on the wind speed , on finite size effects , etc ... note that this analysis explains for example why martian dunes whose sizes are of the order of a kilometer are not ` complex ' or ` compound ' as their equivalents on earth @xcite . following our scaling relation , they correspond to the small terrestrial dunes and the whole dune field on the floor of a crater should rather be considered as a complex martian dune .",
    "a ` similarity law ' for the size of ( developed ) dunes with @xmath4 was schematically drawn by kroy _",
    "@xcite , supported by the existence of centimetric barchans under water @xcite .",
    "however , this similarity was announced to fail with martian dunes .",
    "in fact , the scaling of large dunes ( i.e. whose sizes are much larger than the elementary length @xmath0 ) with @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) is far from obvious as the size selection of barchans involves secondary instabilities related to collisions and fluctuations of wind direction  @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to end this section with the prediction of the wavelength at which a flat sand bed should destabilize on titan where ( longitudinal or seif ) dunes have been recently discovered @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere there is approximately four times denser than on earth , and the grains are believed to be made of water ice @xcite .",
    "computing the threshold curves ( not shown ) , one observes that the dynamical and static thresholds are almost identical and that the minimum of threshold shear stress is reached for @xmath90 m . using this size for the grain diameter a density ratio of the order of @xmath91",
    ", we find a centimetric drag length .",
    "following the scaling law of figure [ dunes_scalingmtw ] , this would lead to a dune wavelength between @xmath35 and @xmath92 meters .",
    "note that , unfortunately , this is well below the resolution of cassini radar .",
    "now that we have this unique length scale at hand for dunes , it is interesting to address the question of the corresponding growth time scales and propagation velocities . the linear stability analysis",
    "@xcite tells that the growth rate @xmath93 and the propagation velocity @xmath94 of bedforms are related to the wavenumber @xmath95 as @xmath96 where @xmath24 is the saturated sand flux   assumed constant   over a flat bed . in order to make these relations quantitative for the bedforms on earth and mars , we need an effective time averaged flux @xmath97 . recall from equation ( [ qdetau ] )",
    "that @xmath24 can be related to the shear velocity @xmath37 . for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that there is sand transport ( @xmath98 ) a fraction @xmath99 of the time and that the shear stress is then constant and equal to @xmath100 .",
    "the time averaged sand flux can thus be effectively expressed as @xmath101 the values of the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 which come into equation ( [ sigmaetcdek ] ) depend on the excess of shear above the threshold as @xmath102 .",
    "the timescale over which an instability develops is that of the most unstable mode .",
    "this means that @xmath93 and @xmath94 should be evaluated at @xmath103 ( see equation ( [ kmax ] ) ) and thus scale as : @xmath104 using meteorological data and measurements of the average dune velocities , we estimated that @xmath105 is between @xmath9 to @xmath106  m@xmath107/year @xcite and @xmath108 between @xmath109% and @xmath110% .",
    "this gives an effective value @xmath111 between @xmath112 and @xmath92 .",
    "calculating explicitly the prefactors , we get a growth time @xmath113  weeks and @xmath114  m / year , values which are consistent with direct observation .",
    "note that time scales for individual fully developed dunes depend on their size , but are also proportional to @xmath115 @xcite .    in order to compare these terrestrial values to those on mars",
    ", we need to estimate the different factors which come into the expressions ( [ sigmadek2 ] ) and ( [ cdek2 ] ) .",
    "recall that , on earth , for grains of @xmath116 m , we have @xmath117 m/s . the corresponding value for the @xmath59 m sized martian grains can be found on figure  [ shieldsmars ] and reads @xmath118 m/s .",
    "the mars to earth ratios for the fluid and grain densities , as well as the gravity acceleration are known . as discussed in the calculation of the transport thresholds ( see appendix )",
    "one expects that @xmath119 is of order unity and for simplicity we simply take @xmath120 .",
    "finally , the most speculative part naturally concerns the value of @xmath121 . assuming that the winds on mars are similar to those on earth",
    ", we computed on our wind data from atlantic sahara the fraction of time during which @xmath122 m/s and got @xmath123 .",
    "this value corresponds to few days per year and is probably realistic as , besides , the soil of mars is frozen during the winter season . with these numerical values , we find that @xmath124 is smaller than @xmath125 by more than five decades .",
    "in other words , the typical time over which we could see a significant evolution of the bedforms on martian dunes is of the order of tens to hundreds centuries .",
    "similarly , the ratio @xmath126 is of the order of @xmath127 .",
    "note that these mars to earth time and velocity ratios are proportional to @xmath121 , so that larger or smaller values for this speculative parameter do not change dramatically the conclusions , the main contribution being the density ratio to the power @xmath92 or @xmath47 ( see equations ( [ sigmadek2][cdek2 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , as some satellite high resolution pictures definitively show some evidence of aeolian activity ",
    "e.g. avalanche outlines  it may well be that the martian dunes are fully active but not significantly at the the human scale .",
    "as for the last section , we would like to conclude the paper with a summary of the status of the numerous hypothesis and facts we have mixed and discussed .",
    "although coming from recent theoretical works , it is now well accepted that the wavelength @xmath0 at which dunes form from a flat sand bed is governed by the so - called saturation length @xmath4 . however , the dependences of @xmath4 with the numerous control parameters ( shields number , grain and flow reynolds numbers , galileo number , grain to fluid density ratio , finite size effects , etc ) is still a matter of debate . in this paper , we have collected measurements of @xmath0 in various situations that where previously thought of as disconnected : subaqueous ripples , micro - dunes in venus wind tunnel , fresh snow dunes , aeolian dunes on earth and dunes on mars . we show that the averaged wavelength ( and thus @xmath4 ) is proportional to the grain size times the grain to fluid density ratio .",
    "this does not preclude sub - dominant dependencies of @xmath4 with the other dimensionless parameters .",
    "in each situation listed above , we have faced specific difficulties .",
    "+ _ subaqueous ripples    _ the transport mechanism under water , namely the direct entrainment by the fluid , is different from the four other situations",
    ". the saturation process could thus be very different in this case .",
    "the longest relaxation length could for instance be controlled by the grain sedimentation , as recently suggested by charru  @xcite . as there is also negative feedback of transport on the flow",
    ", the destabilization wavelength would be larger than our prediction .",
    "the formation of subaqueous ripples has remained controversial mostly because the experimental data are very dispersed .",
    "most of them suffer from finite size effects ( water depth or friction on lateral walls ) , from uncontrolled entrance conditions leading to an inhomogeneous destabilization , or from a late determination of the wavelength after a pattern coarsening period .",
    "for the furthest left data point only , we are certain that all these problems were avoided . + _ ` venus ' micro - dunes    _",
    "this beautiful experiment gives the most dispersed data of the plot .",
    "part of it may be due to the defects listed just above .",
    "the complex variation of the wavelength with the wind speed observed experimentally could be interpreted as a sub - dominant dependance of the saturation length on the shields number .",
    "however , not only the size of the dunes changes but also their shapes .",
    "this is definitely the signature of a second length scale at work .",
    "+ _ fresh snow dunes    _ on the basis of existing photographs , we have clearly identified snow dunes pattern resembling sand aeolian destabilization ones .",
    "they form under strong wind , on icy substrate .",
    "the obvious difficulty is that the precise state of the snow flakes during the dune formation involves complex thermodynamical processes that do not exist in the other cases .",
    "+ _ aeolian dunes on earth    _ although the instability takes place in the field under varying wind conditions , the resulting wavelength is very robust from place to place and time to time .",
    "we consider this point as the reference one in the plot .",
    "+ _ martian dunes    _ the specific difficulty of the martian case does not come from the wavelength measurements , as the available photographs are well resolved in space , but rather from the prior determination of the diameter @xmath6 of the grains involved .",
    "the controversy comes from early determinations based on thermal diffusivity measurements , concluding that dunes are covered by large ( @xmath57 m ) grains .",
    "such large grains would lead to a significant shift of the data point towards the right of figure  [ dunes_scalingmtw ] .",
    "a large part of this paper is consequently devoted to an independent determination of @xmath6 , based on the analysis of the martian rovers photographs .",
    "our determination is very different : @xmath128 m .",
    "we have computed the sand transport phase diagram with more subtleties than in the available literature ( including in particular hysteresis and cohesion ) and shown that this size corresponds to saltating grains .",
    "a directly related controversial point was the state of the martian dunes ( still active or fossile ) .",
    "we have shown that moderately large winds can transport the grains ( the dynamical threshold is much lower than the static one ) but that the characteristic time scale over which dunes form is five orders of magnitude larger than on earth .

    "this study was financially supported by an ` aci jeunes chercheurs ' of the french ministry of research .",
    "we have directly measured the grain diameter ( @xmath128 m ) in martian ripples photographed by the rovers .",
    "we then made the double assumption that ( i ) the grains composing the martian dunes are of the same size and that ( ii ) these grains participate to saltation transport whenever the wind is sufficiently strong . in order to support hypothesis ( ii ) , we have computed the transport thresholds in the martian conditions .",
    "we find that the grains which move first for an increasing wind are around @xmath129 m in diameter .",
    "the full discussion of the transport thresholds is however too heavy to be incorporated into the body of the article , mainly devoted to the dune wavelength scaling law .",
    "we give below a short but self - sufficient derivation of the scaling laws for the static and dynamic transport thresholds .",
    "we consider the generic case of a fluid boundary layer over a flat bed composed of identical sand grains . for given grains and surrounding fluid , the shear stress @xmath11 controls the sand transport.the dominant mechanism for grain erosion depends on the sand to fluid density ratio . in dense fluids grains",
    "are directly entrained by the flow whereas in low density fluids grains are mostly splashed up by other grains impacting the sand bed .",
    "two thresholds are associated to these two mechanisms : starting from a purely static sand bed , the first grain is dragged from the bed and brought into motion at the static threshold @xmath130 .",
    "once sand transport is established , it can sustain by the collision / ejection processes down to a second threshold @xmath131 .",
    "the sand transport thus presents an hysteresis ",
    "responsible for instance for the formation of streamers .",
    "finally , when the fluid velocity becomes sufficiently high , more and more grains remain in suspension in the flow , trapped in large velocity fluctuations .",
    "although there is no precise threshold associated to suspension , one expect that these fluctuations becomes dominant for the grain trajectories when the shear velocity @xmath132 is much larger than the grain sedimentation velocity @xmath133 .",
    "the behaviour of these thresholds in the martian atmosphere , as well as in water and air , with respect to the grain diameter is summarized in figures [ shieldsmars ] and [ shieldswaterair ] , and we shall now discuss how to compute these curves .",
    "[ [ an - analytic - expression - for - the - turbulent - boundary - layer - velocity - profile ] ] an analytic expression for the turbulent boundary layer velocity profile ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in the dune context , the flow is generically turbulent far from the sand bed and the velocity profile is known to be logarithmic .",
    "however , our problem is more complicated as we have to relate the velocity @xmath134 of the flow around the sand grains ( i.e. the velocity at the altitude , say , @xmath135 that we call @xmath136 in the following ) to the shear velocity @xmath37 .",
    "depending on the grain based reynolds number , there either exists a viscous sub - layer between the soil and the fully turbulent zone , or the momentum transfer is directly due to the fluctuations induced by the soil roughness .",
    "the first step is thus to derive an expression for the turbulent boundary layer wind profile valid in the two regimes , far or close to the bed .",
    "to do so , we express the shear stress as the sum of a visous and a turbulent part as @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath139 the von krmn constant and @xmath140 the aerodynamic roughness rescaled by the grain diameter @xmath6 . the shear stress is constant all through the turbulent boundary layer and equal to @xmath141 .",
    "let us define the grain reynolds number as : @xmath142 and a non - dimensional distance to the bed : @xmath143 note that @xmath144 is tends to @xmath35 on the sand bed and that it is equal to @xmath145 at the center of the grain . with this notations , the differential equation ( [ tauv+t ] )",
    "can be rewritten under the form : @xmath146 which is easily integrated into : @xmath147_{\\bar{z}=1}^{\\bar{z}=z}. \\label{windprofile}\\ ] ] performing expansions in the purely viscous and turbulent regimes , one can show that a good approximation of the relation between the shear velocity @xmath37 and typical velocity around the grain @xmath136 is given by @xmath148      the bed load ( tractation ) threshold is directly related to the fact that the grains are trapped in the potential holes created by the grains at the sand bed surface . to get the scaling laws ,",
    "the simplest geometry to consider is a single spherical grain jammed between the two neighbouring ( fixed ) grains below it , see figure  [ threshold]a .",
    "let us first discuss the situation in which the cohesive forces between the grains are negligible and the friction at the contacts is sufficient to prevent sliding .",
    "it can be inferred from figure  [ threshold]a that the loss of equilibrium occurs for a value of the driving force @xmath149 proportional to the submerged weight of the grain : @xmath150 , where @xmath66 is the mass density of the sand grain , and @xmath65 is that of the fluid  which is negligible with respect to @xmath66 in the case of aeolian transport . as @xmath149 is proportional to the shear force @xmath151 exerted by the fluid ,",
    "the non - dimensional parameter controlling the onset of motion is the shields number , which characterises the ratio of the driving shear stress to the normal stress : @xmath152 the threshold value can be estimated from the geometry of the piling , and depends on whether rolling or lifting is the mechanism which makes the grain move .",
    "finally , the local slope of the bed modifies the threshold value as traps between the grains are less deep when the bed is inclined .",
    "in particular , its value must vanish as the bed slope approaches the ( tangent of the ) avalanche angle .",
    "we here ignore these refinements which can be incorporated into the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see section [ instab ] ) .    at the threshold ,",
    "the horizontal force balance on a grain of the bed reads @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a friction coefficient , and @xmath155 the drag coefficient which is a function of the grain reynolds number . with a good accuracy",
    ", the drag law for natural grains can be put under the form : @xmath156 with @xmath157 and @xmath158 for natural sand grains @xcite .    at this stage , we introduce the viscous size @xmath159 , defined as the diameter of grains whose free fall reynolds number @xmath160 is unity : @xmath161 it corresponds to a grain size at which viscous and gravity effects are of the same order of magnitude . we define @xmath162 as the fluid velocity at the scale of the grain normalised by @xmath163 . from the three previous relations , we get the equation for @xmath164 : @xmath165 which solves into @xmath166 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the expression of the static threshold shields number is finally : @xmath167      for small grains , the cohesion of the material strongly increases the static threshold shear stress .",
    "evaluating the adhesion force between grains is a difficult problem in itself .",
    "we consider here two grains at the limit of separation and we assume that the multi - contact surface between the grains has been created with a maximum normal load @xmath168 , see figure  [ threshold]b .",
    "the adhesion force @xmath169 can be expressed as an effective surface tension @xmath170 times the radius of curvature of the contact , which is assumed to scale on the grain diameter : @xmath171 this effective surface tension is much smaller than the actual one , @xmath172 , as the real area of contact @xmath173 is much smaller than the apparent one @xmath174 .",
    ": @xmath175 the apparent area of contact can be computed following hertz law for two spheres in contact under a load @xmath168 : @xmath176 where e is the young modulus of the grain @xcite . to express the real area of contact , we need to know whether the micro - contacts are in an elastic or a plastic regime . within a good approximation",
    ", @xmath173 can expressed in both cases @xcite as : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the young modulus @xmath179 ( elastic regime ) or the hardness @xmath180 ( plastic regime ) of the material .",
    "altogether , we then get : @xmath181    in order to bring into motion such grains , the shear must be large enough to overcome both weight and adhesion , so that , for @xmath182 ( i.e. the weight of one grain ) the critical shields number is the sum of two terms and takes the form of @xmath183,\\ ] ] with @xmath184 note that , by contrast to the references @xcite , we find that the adhesive force finally scales , for @xmath185 with @xmath186 and the critical shields number with @xmath187 ( instead of exponents @xmath35 and @xmath188 respectively )",
    ".      the dynamical threshold can be defined as the value of the control parameter for which the saturated flux vanishes . fitting the flux _",
    "vs _ shear velocity relation , one can measure the dynamical threshold in a very precise way ( see for instance the analysis in @xcite of the data obtained by rasmussen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the wind velocity profile is almost undisturbed at the dynamical threshold .",
    "the shear stress threshold is thus achieved when the velocity that a grain acquires after a single jump is just sufficient to eject on average one single grain out of the bed after a collision ( unit replacement capacity criterion ) .",
    "the impact velocity at this dynamical threshold is thus proportional to the trapping velocity i.e. the velocity needed for a grain to escape from its potential trapping ( see quartier _",

    "in order to get a reasonable transport diagram on mars , we have first tuned the different parameters controlling the dynamic and static thresholds to reproduce _ within the same model _ the underwater and aeolian data ( figure  [ shieldswaterair ] ) .",
    "for the friction coefficient @xmath154 , we have simply taken the avalanche slope for typical aeolian grains @xmath193 . as already found in @xcite ,",
    "the rescaled soil roughness @xmath140 is higher than the value found by bagnold .",

    "the value of @xmath195 , the impact velocity needed to eject statistically one grain rescaled by the trapping velocity , is adjusted to @xmath86 .",
    "the restitution coefficient was adjusted to @xmath196 . for obvious reasons it is possible to obtain almost the same curves with different pairs ( @xmath195 , @xmath197 ) .",
    "finally the cohesion length @xmath198 was tuned to @xmath199 m , which is consistent with the above calculation .",
    "we see in figure  [ shieldswaterair ] that the agreement is excellent both in the aeolian and underwater cases . due to the low density ratio in water ,",
    "the collision process is completely inefficient . as a consequence ,",
    "the dynamical threshold is well above the static one : the only erosion mechanism is the direct entrainment of grains by the fluid ( tractation ) . on the other hand , the static threshold ",
