    "during their first ascent along the red giant branch ( rgb ) , low - mass stars are known to experience extra mixing in their convectively stable radiative zones , between the hydrogen burning shell ( hbs ) and the bottom of the convective envelope ( bce ) .",
    "this occurs above the bump luminosity ( @xcite ) , after the hbs has crossed and erased a chemical composition discontinuity left behind by the bce at the end of the first dredge - up ( fdu ) . as a result , the atmospheric @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio and , in metal - poor stars , carbon abundance resume their post - fdu declines with increasing luminosity .",
    "extra mixing is needed to explain the observed low carbon isotopic ratios in evolved stars with initial masses up to @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "another abundance anomaly that has also been associated with the start of rgb extra mixing at the bump luminosity is the lithium enrichment that has been detected in a small fraction ( 12% ) of k giants ( @xcite ) . to produce @xmath3li via the @xmath3be mechanism ( @xcite ) , extra mixing has to be nearly three orders of magnitude faster in these stars than in other low - mass red giants above the bump luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of the origin of li enrichment in k giants has recently been addressed again by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter krl ) .",
    "they observed 2000 k giants with determined hipparcos parallaxes and found that 15 of them are li - rich .",
    "however , the most interesting new result is that many of these li - rich k giants are located well below the bump luminosity , close to the red horizontal - branch clump region of the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) , where the low - mass stars should arrive much later , after they will have experienced the he - core flash .",
    "the newly discovered li - rich k giants also exhibit very low @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratios , approaching the equilibrium value for the cn cycle in four of them .",
    "analysing these data , krl have proposed that the lithium enrichment in these k giants occurred during the he - core flash rather than at the bump luminosity .    in this letter",
    ", we present an alternative explanation ; namely , we assume that these stars have already reached the bump luminosity and , therefore , that rgb extra mixing is now operating in their radiative zones .",
    "however , for some reason , presumably because of their very rapid internal rotation , this mixing is so efficient that not only can it trigger the @xmath3be mechanism , but its driving force or associated heat transport can also modify the radiative zone s thermal structure , resulting in a temperature gradient that is closer to the adiabatic one . in this case",
    ", a bump - luminosity star in which such enhanced extra mixing has just started should make an extended zigzag on the hrd towards much lower luminosities , comparable to those of red clump stars , before resuming its ascent along the rgb ( @xcite ) .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by a striking resemblance between the photometric and chemical composition peculiarities of the primary ( red - giant ) components of the rs cvn binaries and the li - rich k - giants studied by krl .",
    "the rs cvn binaries are close stellar systems in which the primary components are low - mass red giants . in many cases ,",
    "the rs cvn giant components have synchronized their spin and orbital periods and , as a result of their fast rotation caused by the tidal spinning up , they show signatures of chromospheric activity ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite have noted a remarkable photometric peculiarity intrinsic to the rs cvn giants and other k - giants in tidally locked binaries  most of them reside on the lower rgb , below the bump luminosity .",
    "@xcite have shown that , after having reached the bump luminosity , a low - mass star will make a long excursion towards much lower luminosities if the temperature gradient @xmath4 in its radiative zone increases and takes a value between the radiative and adiabatic temperature gradients , @xmath5 .",
    "such a deviation of @xmath6 from @xmath7 can be explained in two ways . on the one hand",
    ", a rotational distortion of level surfaces in the radiative zone leads to an increase of @xmath8 to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the ratio of the equatorial centrifugal acceleration to gravity divided by 3 , and @xmath11 is its critical value at which the roche equipotential surface breaks up at the equator ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is this effect that was proposed by @xcite to be responsible for the photometric peculiarity of red giants in tidally locked binaries . on the other hand , fast differential rotation and its related",
    "hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic instabilities can be driving mechanisms for extra mixing in stellar radiative zones ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "besides chemical elements , this extra mixing should also transport heat .",
    "the efficiency of the latter process in the standard mixing length theory is estimated by the quantity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the rate ( diffusion coefficient ) of extra mixing , @xmath14 is the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath15 is the factor determined by the geometry of the fluid elements . in this case , the temperature gradient lies between @xmath7 and @xmath16 , and its value is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the giant components of the rs cvn binaries selected by us from the paper of @xcite for comparison and the li - rich k giants discovered by krl both have nearly solar metallicities and masses close to @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we compare their positions on the hrd ( the red and blue star symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) with the evolution of two stellar models calculated for the solar heavy - element and helium mass fractions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and initial masses @xmath22 and @xmath2 ( the black and green curves in the same figure ) .",
    "the neighbouring open symbols along the evolutionary tracks are separated by one million years .",
    "their concentrations on the green curve at low @xmath23 are increased at the bump luminosity , @xmath24 , and at the red clump , @xmath25 . before the star has evolved beyond the bump luminosity",
    ", its radiative zone contains a strong gradient of the mean molecular weight , @xmath26 , that is believed to prevent any extra mixing .",
    "the blue star symbols are all located below the bump luminosity , in a region of the hrd that the standard evolutionary track ( the green curve ) of a low - mass red giant with a chemically uniform radiative zone can reach only after the he - core flash .",
    "this explains why krl have inferred that both the production of li and the reduction of the carbon isotopic ratio in their li - rich k - giants occurred during the he - core flash .    however , the @xmath3be mechanism of surface li enrichment requires strongly enhanced extra mixing with a rate ( diffusion coefficient ) increased by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to that of canonical extra mixing operating in the majority of rgb stars above the bump luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "we surmise that such mixing or its associated fast rotation should modify @xmath6 in the radiative zone bringing its value closer to @xmath16 .",
    "the red curve originating from @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] shows a bifurcation of the evolution of the @xmath2 star after the bump luminosity caused by our assumption that the start of enhanced extra mixing with @xmath27@xmath28s@xmath29 in this star has initiated a convective heat transport in its radiative zone with the efficiency @xmath30 .",
    "it is seen that the star spends quite a long time at luminosities close to those of the li - rich k - giants .",
    "we have assumed that the enhanced extra mixing has the same maximum depth , @xmath31 , as the canonical one ( @xcite ) . before the hbs , advancing in mass outwards , has crossed the chemical composition discontinuity left behind by the bce at the end of the fdu , the mixing is allowed to operate only in the chemically uniform zone between the bce and the current location of the discontinuity at @xmath32 .",
    "note that it is the increase of @xmath6 , not the effect of mixing , that forces the star to make the extended zigzag .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] also shows that the region occupied by the majority of tidally locked giants in close binaries , including the rs cvn giant components ( red star symbols ) , is reached by the evolutionary u - turn of the @xmath22 star ( red curve ) when @xmath33 .",
    "the parameter values @xmath27@xmath28s@xmath29 , @xmath31 , and @xmath30 lead to both li enrichment + 12 $ ] , where @xmath34 is the number density of the corresponding nucleus . ] and reduction of the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio consistent with those reported by krl for the li - rich k giants ( solid red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , an increase of the efficiency of convective heat transport to @xmath33 shifts the hrd location of the li enrichment and , especially , that of the @xmath0c/@xmath1c sharp decline to the edges of their corresponding observational domains ( dashed red curves in the same figures ) . therefore ,",
    "if our hypothesis is correct , @xmath35 should be close to 0.75 and not exceed 1 by much .",
    "a similar value of @xmath35 is needed to explain the photometric peculiarity of red giants in tidally locked binaries , including the rs cvn giant components ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) . @xcite have predicted that some of these stars , those that have already reached the bump luminosity and are now making extended zigzags towards lower luminosities as a result of their fast rotation , should have carbon isotopic ratios smaller than the standard post - fdu value of @xmath0c/@xmath36 .",
    "recently , two such stars have actually been found ( @xcite ) ; the chromospherically active rs cvn - type stars @xmath37and ( hd222107 ) and 29 draconis ( hd160538 ) are located below the bump luminosity but have @xmath0c/@xmath38 and 16 , respectively .",
    "when comparing the li - rich k giants with the rs cvn binaries , it is important to bear in mind that a hunt after the former is biased towards finding the stars that have already reached the bump luminosity and are now experiencing enhanced extra mixing , while a search for the latter selects both the pre- and post - bump luminosity stars .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the third rs cvn - type star , 33 piscium , studied by the same group does not show signatures of extra mixing ( @xcite )",
    ". it would be interesting to measure carbon isotopic ratios in the following rs cvn stars : hd19754 , hd182776 , hd202134 , hd204128 , and hd205249 .",
    "they have relatively high ( for red giants ) projected rotational velocities ( @xmath39kms@xmath29 ) and probably strongly increased atmospheric abundances of na and al ( @xcite ) , which might be a manifestation of enhanced extra mixing ( @xcite ) .    for comparison , green curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] show the evolutionary changes of the li abundance and @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio at the surface of the @xmath2 star produced by the fdu ( before the bump luminosity ) and thermohaline convection driven by @xmath40he burning that reduces @xmath41 in the tail of the hbs after the bump luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rate of the latter is approximated by @xmath42k$ ] ( @xcite ) with the observationally constrained value of the aspect ratio , @xmath43 , of a fluid element , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are its length and diameter .",
    "note that direct numerical simulations of the @xmath40he - driven thermohaline convection in a bump - luminosity red giant give an estimate of @xmath46 , which does not support the hypothesis that it is the principal mechanism of rgb extra mixing ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the majority of low - mass red giants , that are experiencing extra mixing above the bump luminosity , the observed evolutionary changes of their surface chemical composition are reproduced reasonably well either with the above - mentioned thermohaline diffusion coefficient @xmath47 that uses @xmath48 , or with the diffusion coefficient @xmath49@xmath50 and appropriately chosen mixing depth , e.g. @xmath31 ( @xcite ) . for the radiative zone of our @xmath2 bump - luminosity model ,",
    "these diffusion coefficients are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] ( the green and black curves ) .",
    "their corresponding efficiencies of heat transport are negligibly small .",
    "therefore , in the majority of cases , the ( canonical ) rgb extra mixing should not lead to noticeable changes in the evolution of these stars on the hrd .    on the contrary , the value of @xmath27 @xmath28s@xmath29 , that is required to understand the origin of li - rich k giants in our models , results in @xmath51 , at least in the inner half of the radiative zone ( compare the red and blue curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : f4 ] ) , therefore such ( enhanced ) extra mixing has to be accompanied by an efficient heat transport .",
    "we have shown that the increase of @xmath35 to a value between 0.75 and 1 also helps to explain the photometric peculiarities intrinsic to both the majority of red giants in tidally locked binaries , including the rs cvn stars , and the li - rich k giants studied by krl .",
    "however , post - bump luminosity stars with @xmath52 would make zigzags that are too lengthy , in conflict with observations . this disagreement can be resolved if , following @xcite , we assume that the enhanced extra mixing is produced by highly anisotropic turbulence whose associated chemical and heat transport in the horizontal direction strongly dominates over those in the vertical direction , @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that , in this case , @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] , while the expression @xmath56 still holds . in the standard",
    "mixing length theory , @xmath30 and @xmath33 correspond to @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "for the anisotropic turbulent mixing , we obtain @xmath59 , assuming that @xmath60 and @xmath61 . at the same time",
    ", we can still get the observationally supported value of @xmath62 , provided that @xmath63 , or @xmath64 .",
    "this means that , for @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] ) , we need @xmath66 to keep @xmath67 close to 0.75 .",
    "interestingly , @xcite has used a similar ratio of @xmath68 to @xmath13 for the rotation - driven turbulent diffusion to make his model of magnetic braking of solar rotation consistent with observational data .",
    "moreover , the same order of magnitude ratios @xmath69 were obtained for radiative zones of bump luminosity red giant models by @xcite who took into account self - consistently the transport of angular momentum by rotation - driven meridional circulation and shear turbulence .",
    "given that @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the radiative zone of a bump - luminosity red giant , the maximum deviation of @xmath6 from @xmath7 that can be achieved at the break - up rotation corresponds to @xmath72 , which is too small to reproduce the extended zigzags presumably made by the li - rich k giants and rs cvn giant components .",
    "however , this conclusion is based only on the analysis of the modification of the temperature gradient by the rotational distortion .",
    "it ignores the fact that effects of rotation are also incorporated in other equations of stellar structure ( @xcite ) . with all the effects taken into account",
    ", @xcite were actually able to construct the evolutionary track of a @xmath22 star whose post - bump luminosity zigzag reached the hrd domain occupied by the rs cvn binaries .    comparing the green and red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] , we infer that the @xmath40he - driven thermohaline convection could be responsible for the observed li enrichment only if the aspect ratio of its fluid elements were as large as @xmath73 . at present",
    ", we consider this highly improbable .",
    "the more likely interpretation from our point of view is that the li enrichment in the stars studied by krl and their location on the lower rgb below the bump luminosity are both caused by their fast internal rotation and its associated turbulent mixing and heat transport .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the fact that surface rotation velocities of field stars with @xmath74 remain constant as they evolve on and away from the main sequence ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that only the most rapidly rotating stars , of which a handful have @xmath75 kms@xmath29 , become li - rich and make extended zigzags after the bump luminosity .",
    "our hypothesis does not exclude the possibility of li enrichment above the bump luminosity in a red giant that has been spun up as a result of its engulfing an orbiting giant planet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only possible scenario in which a substantial mixing of h - rich material occurs during the he - core flash is the `` hydrogen injection flash '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "the he ignition starts off - center , which leads to the formation of a he convective shell . for this scenario to work ,",
    "convection from the he - burning shell must penetrate into the hbs . in the mesa stellar evolution code , such penetration , also known as convective overshooting , is modeled by the exponentially decaying diffusion coefficient @xmath76 $ ] , where @xmath77 is the pressure scale height , and @xmath78 is a convective diffusion coefficient estimated using a mixing - length theory at the radius @xmath79 near the convective boundary ( @xcite ) .",
    "our computations of the he - core flash in the @xmath22 star show that h can be injected into the he convective shell only when @xmath80 .",
    "this exceeds the observationally constrained value of @xmath67 by nearly an order of magnitude ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "besides , given the discussed similarities between the li - rich k giants studied by krl and the rs cvn giant components and the fact that the latter stars are definitely on the lower rgb , because otherwise they would have undergone a common - envelope event with their close binary companions , we believe that these stars are in the same evolutionary phase .",
    "it should also be noted that the inclusion of convective overshooting in main - sequence stars would shift the maximum initial mass of the solar - composition stars that experience the he - core flash from @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "our hypothesis could eventually be tested by asteroseismology because high - precision photometry capable of measuring g - mode oscillations in red giants allows `` to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen - shell - burning stars ( period spacing mostly @xmath8350 seconds ) and those that are also burning helium ( period spacing @xmath83100 to 300 seconds ) '' ( @xcite ) ."
