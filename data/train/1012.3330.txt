    "the discovery of superconductivity in 2001 in the intermetallic compound mgb@xmath2 , with a critical temperature @xmath12 k @xcite , has motivated a lot of theoretical and experimental studies in order to understand the origin and characteristics of the relatively high @xmath11 in this material .",
    "it is now generally accepted that mgb@xmath2 is a phonon - mediated superconductor , and that the high transition temperature arises due to a combination of several peculiar features in its electronic structure and electron - phonon coupling , which conspire to produce a superconducting state with multiple gaps @xcite .",
    "its electronic band structure in the vicinity of the fermi energy consists of two bonding @xmath13 bands corresponding to in - plane @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) hybridization in the boron layer and two @xmath16 bands ( bonding and anti - bonding ) formed by hybridized boron @xmath17 orbitals .",
    "a substantial part of the electron - phonon coupling has its origin in the interaction of states at the @xmath13-band fermi surfaces with one specific phonon mode , the b - b bond stretching mode with @xmath18 symmetry at the @xmath19 point @xcite .",
    "in addition , mgb@xmath2 possesses two distinct superconducting gaps associated with the @xmath13 and @xmath16 fermi surfaces .",
    "this superconducting state can be described within a multiband version of the eliashberg theory where the pairing interaction is split into intra- and interband contributions @xcite .    in the search for related compounds with similar outstanding superconducting properties , only a few variants of mgb@xmath2 have been found . among them , two alloy systems could be successfully synthesized based on the partial substitution of mg by al @xcite and b by c @xcite , respectively .",
    "both substitutions provide electron doping to the alloy and lead to a reduction of @xmath11 . for mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath2 and mgb@xmath3c@xmath4 , loss of superconductivity",
    "is found for @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite , respectively . a correlation between the @xmath11 reduction and the filling of the hole - type @xmath13-bands as a function of al - doped content",
    "was found by _ first principles _ calculations within the virtual - crystal approximation @xcite . in parallel with the reduction of @xmath11 also a decrease of the superconducting gaps @xmath9 and @xmath10 has been observed . for single crystals as well as polycrystals al doping",
    "was found to decrease both @xmath13 and @xmath16 gaps monotonically , which , however , stay distinguishable even for @xmath11 as low as 10 k @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that the interband scattering @xmath23 remains small even at high doping levels , and is insufficient to produce a merging of the @xmath13 and @xmath16 gaps .",
    "on contrast , for the c - doped system , contradictory experimental results have been reported with respect to the question if the superconducting gaps merge as a function of doping @xcite . in all experiments a decrease of both gaps with c doping was observed .",
    "there are point - contact tunneling @xcite , point - contact spectroscopy @xcite and photoemission spectroscopy @xcite measurements that show a clear difference between the @xmath13 and @xmath16 gaps at all doping levels . however , there exists also point - contact spectroscopy measurements @xcite that suggest a merging of the gaps at @xmath24 k ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this was then interpreted as a doping - induced increase of the interband scattering @xmath23 , which tends to reduce gap anisotropies .    from the theoretical point of view , many investigations have been performed to study the doping dependence of the structural @xcite , electronic @xcite , vibrational @xcite and superconducting properties @xcite of the mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath2 and mgb@xmath3c@xmath4 systems using different approximations for the simulation of the alloys , like the supercell approach @xcite , the rigid band approximation ( rba ) @xcite , the virtual - crystal approximation ( vca ) @xcite , the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite , and the korringa - kohn - rostoker coherent potential approximation ( kkr - cpa ) @xcite . however , in particular for the supercell and cpa approaches , the studies have been limited to a few al or c concentrations only , because these calculations are computationally very demanding , especially if one is interested in very low ( close to mg or b ) or high ( close to al ) concentrations .",
    "additionally , in these approaches the symmetry of the original system is lost , which complicates the interpretation and understanding of experimental results as a function of doping .    in this paper",
    ", we present a study of the electron - phonon and superconducting properties of mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath2 and mgb@xmath3c@xmath4 within the framework of density functional theory @xcite using the self - consistent virtual - crystal approximation ( vca ) @xcite .",
    "we calculate the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) properties such as the eliashberg function , @xmath26 , and the e - ph coupling constant , @xmath27 , within the two - band model as a function of doping . by solving the two - band eliashberg gap equations on the imaginary axis",
    "we obtain the superconducting gaps , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the value of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath5 or @xmath7 for the mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath2 and mgb@xmath3c@xmath4 alloys , respectively .",
    "the evolution of these quantities is analyzed and discussed in connection with changes in the electronic and vibrational properties .",
    "the calculations were performed with the mixed - basis pseudopotential method ( mbpp ) @xcite . for mg / al and b / c norm - conserving pseudopotentials",
    "were constructed according to the vanderbilt description @xcite .",
    "details of pseudopotentials , basis functions and calculational aspects for ground - state and phonon properties can be found in a previous publication @xcite .",
    "the mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath2 and mgb@xmath3c@xmath4 alloys were modeled in the self - consistent virtual - crystal approximation ( vca ) @xcite .",
    "the vca is implemented within the mbpp method @xcite by generating new pseudopotentials with a fractional nuclear charge at the mg or b site for each @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively ( al : @xmath28=12+@xmath5 and c : @xmath28=5+@xmath7 ) , and by adjusting the valence charge accordingly @xcite . from our previous results for the electronic and vibrational properties @xcite the screened electron - phonon matrix elements",
    "were calculated via density functional perturbation theory @xcite , which are the key elements of the eliashberg theory @xcite .",
    "the calculations employ the pbe version of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite , and are performed at the optimal lattice parameters for each doping level @xcite .",
    "eliashberg functions for all band combinations where obtained by standard fourier interpolation of quantities calculated with a dense @xmath29 @xmath30-point mesh and a @xmath31 @xmath32-point mesh .",
    "the original four - band eliashberg functions are projected onto an effective two - band model by averaging over the two @xmath13 and the two @xmath16 bands , respectively .",
    "the partial and total eliashberg functions are given by the following expressions ,    @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the band indices @xmath13 or @xmath16 , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the partial ( total ) electronic density of states at the fermi level ( per atom and spin ) , and @xmath39 is the e - ph matrix element for scattering of an electron from a bloch state with momentum @xmath40 to another bloch state @xmath41 by a phonon @xmath42 ( @xmath43 indicates the branch index and @xmath44 is the phonon frequency ) .",
    "in a similar way , the partial and total e - ph coupling parameters ( @xmath45 ) are expressed as follows ,    @xmath46    @xmath47    within the two - band model , there are three independent contributions to @xmath26 : two intraband ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) and one interband @xmath50 . with the knowledge of @xmath26 , the two - band eliashberg gap equations @xcite on the imaginary axis were numerically solved in order to obtain the gap values and @xmath11 for each given al or c concentration , respectively .",
    "this procedure has been previously used in similar studies of undoped mgb@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the solution involves four non - linear coupled equations for the matsubara gaps @xmath51 and the renormalization functions @xmath52 ,    @xmath53n^{j}_{\\delta 1}(i\\omega_m),\\ ] ]    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the heaviside function , and @xmath56 is the coulomb pseudopotential , @xmath57 a cutoff frequency ( chosen as @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , is the discrete set of matsubara frequencies .",
    "the pairing interaction is contained in the kernel    @xmath61    and we defined the following quantities : @xmath62    @xmath63    in order to keep the number of adjustable parameter to a minimum , we approximated the coulomb pseudopotential matrix @xmath64 , which is a two - by - two matrix in the case of the two - band model , by a diagonal form proposed earlier @xcite as @xmath65 .",
    "( ref . ) .",
    "however , we tested another form used in previous publications ( refs . ) where the diagonal elements are considered to be different between them additionally off - diagonal ones are included , nevertheless they are much smaller than the diagonal ones",
    ". results in section iii were practically the same for both forms , except for a slight reduction of @xmath10 by 10% . ]",
    "the gap values were identified with @xmath66 , which corresponds to the point on the imaginary axis which is closest to the real axis .",
    "test calculations solving the eliashberg equations on the real axis indicated that this approximation is accurate on the level of 1% or better .",
    "based on our previous results for the electronic and vibrational properties @xcite , we have calculated the electron - phonon coupling quantities of the two - band model ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath67 ) for the ranges @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the al- and c - doped systems , respectively .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the evolution of the eliashberg functions , the total spectra and the four components @xmath26 ( @xmath67 ) of mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath2 for six al concentrations in the superconducting regime ( @xmath700.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.55 ) . we observe that for mgb@xmath2 ( @xmath71 ) the largest contribution to the total spectral function comes from the @xmath49 component , where the main peak centered at approximately 70 mev corresponds to frequency of the @xmath18-phonon mode .",
    "the @xmath48 spectrum has its main contribution from the high - frequency phonon region related to the @xmath72-phonon mode , while the interband contribution , @xmath73(@xmath74 ) , is concentrated in the region between 50 and 70 mev .",
    "we note that , although the @xmath49 part represents the main contribution to the total spectra , the other components can not be neglected in a proper quantitative description of the e - ph coupling and of the superconducting properties .    from the evolution of spectral functions for mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "1 ) we observe that almost all components are reduced by al - doping , but the largest changes are exhibited by @xmath75 .",
    "its main peak shifts to higher frequencies and its area is reduced at the same time until it practically vanishes for @xmath76 .",
    "this doping level is close to the region where the loss of superconductivity has been observed experimentally ( @xmath77 ) @xcite .",
    "the reduction of @xmath75 indicates the loss of intraband e - ph coupling between the @xmath13 states and the bond - stretching phonon modes and has its origin in the continuous filling of the @xmath13 bands , which is completed at @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the shift to higher frequencies is due to the hardening of the @xmath18-phonon mode as @xmath5 increases , a phenomenon discussed previously @xcite . similar to @xmath49 , the @xmath74 interband contribution",
    "is also reduced as a function of @xmath5 and almost disappears at @xmath76 .",
    "on contrast , the @xmath73 contribution shows an slight increase around 50 and 70 mev , and the @xmath48 contribution at higher frequencies strengthens slightly with doping , but the position of its main peak is almost unaffected . in recent electron tunneling spectroscopy measurements on al - doped thin films",
    "@xcite , this general behavior of the eliashberg function indeed has been observed , supporting our results .    in fig .",
    "2 we present the results for the eliashberg functions of mgb@xmath3c@xmath4 for six c concentrations in the superconducting region of the alloy ( @xmath790.0 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.125 , 0.15 , and 0.175 ) .",
    "the different components of @xmath80 exhibit the same trends with increasing c concentration as those found for the al - doping .",
    "however the shape of the spectras are different and the changes take place at lower concentrations . when comparing the two alloys , one should take into account that the number of doping - induced electrons per unit cell is given by @xmath5 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "even with this factor of two , the vanishing of the @xmath49 and @xmath73 contributions at @xmath82 occurs at a much smaller doping level than for al - doping ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the dramatic reduction of @xmath75 at @xmath83 correlates also with the complete filling of the @xmath13-bands on mgb@xmath3c@xmath4 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 calculated total and partial contributions for @xmath45 as well as for @xmath84 are shown .",
    "for mgb@xmath2 the calculated values are @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this @xmath90 value is very close to the experimental one by geerk _",
    "_ @xcite ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "@xmath84 partial contributions for mgb@xmath2 are @xmath92 states ev@xmath93/spin and @xmath94 states ev@xmath93/spin , which are very similar to those calculated earlier by liu _",
    "_ @xcite and golubov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . as seen from fig .",
    "3 , the main contribution to the e - ph coupling ( @xmath45 ) in undoped mgb@xmath2 comes from the @xmath49 component . among the different contributions of the e - ph coupling",
    ", @xmath95 shows the largest changes on doping with a reduction of @xmath96 ( comparing the boundary concentrations )",
    ". the other components also decrease with doping , albeit at different scales , ranging from the nearly constant behavior of @xmath97 and @xmath98 to an almost complete vanishing of @xmath99 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath90 monotonically decreases with doping .",
    "doping - induced changes in the coupling constants can arise from changes in the partial density of states or from changes in the e - ph matrix elements . in order to distinguish between these two possibilities , we plotted in fig .",
    "4 the ratios @xmath100 and @xmath101 . indeed ,",
    "a relationship @xmath102 and @xmath103 can easily be derived from eq . 1 under the assumption of momentum - independent e - ph matrix elements .",
    "the ratios @xmath104 for the interband ( @xmath97 , @xmath99 ) as well as for the intraband @xmath98 couplings remain practically constant as a function of doping for both alloys , indicating that the corresponding e - ph matrix elements are approximately independent of doping",
    ". however , for the ( @xmath49 ) intraband coupling , the ratio exhibits a stronger variation with doping , in particular for al doping , which signals a clear doping dependence of the e - ph matrix elements . in this case , a simple scaling with the partial density of states would be inappropriate to describe the doping dependence of @xmath95 .    to solve the eliashberg gap equations , we determined the single remaining parameter , the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath105 , by the requirement that for undoped mgb@xmath2 the experimental transition temperature of @xmath106k @xcite is reproduced . for a cutoff frequency @xmath107 we found @xmath108",
    "the resulting temperature dependence of the superconducting gaps is shown in fig . 5 and compared with available experimental data @xcite .",
    "the gap values for @xmath109 k are @xmath110 mev and @xmath111 mev , respectively , in good agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the same two - band eliashberg approach was adopted for the alloys mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath2 and mgb@xmath3c@xmath4 keeping @xmath112 at the obtained value for undoped mgb@xmath2 .",
    "the doping dependence of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for both alloys is presented in fig .",
    "6 and compared with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the calculations reproduce the experimental trends that both gaps and @xmath11 decrease with increasing al or c doping . beside this common feature",
    "the two alloys exhibit also striking differences .",
    "the first concerns the doping range where superconductivity exists .",
    "@xmath11 goes to zero close to the critical concentration for which the @xmath13-band is completely filled ( @xmath113(al)@xmath114 , @xmath115(c)@xmath116 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , superconductivity vanishes significantly faster on c doping than on al doping , even when taking into account that one should compare doping levels @xmath117 as discussed above .",
    "the second difference relates to the shape of the @xmath11 versus doping curves . for al doping",
    ", @xmath11 initially drops fast and develops a longer tail , whereas for c doping @xmath11 is only slowly reduced initially , while it exhibits a steeper drop towards the critical concentration where @xmath11 vanishes .",
    "a similar difference in shape is also observed for the larger gap .",
    "as both alloys are electron - doped systems , these differences indicate the importance of the doping site for the superconducting properties . as explained in refs . , the origin of this difference can be traced back to the distribution of the extra charge introduced by doping . in the al - doped system an important portion of the extra electrons",
    "is located in the interplanar region , and only a small fraction in the boron planes .",
    "in contrast , for c doping the extra charge mainly remains in the area between the b atoms within the boron plane , exactly in the region of the @xmath13-bonds .",
    "therefore , the extra charge introduced by c doping is more effective in reducing the number of holes in the @xmath13-band and has a stronger influence on the phonon frequencies , in particular , on the hardening of the @xmath18 mode .",
    "consequently , c doping leads to a faster decrease of the e - ph coupling and of the superconducting properties as compared to al doping .",
    "the various experimental data sets for @xmath11 and the gaps plotted in fig . 6 exhibit a clear spread indicating a large dependence of the superconducting properties on the sample preparation methods and on the physical conditions of the measurement procedure itself .",
    "in addition , an accurate determination of the actual doping concentration in these alloys is complicated and far from trivial .",
    "furthermore , there is so far no consensus about the behavior of the gaps for larger c doping . while some experiments suggest a merging of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 gap at @xmath25 @xcite , others find two distinct gaps even for the highest doping levels @xcite . within these experimental uncertainties ,",
    "our calculations agree quantitatively with the data for both alloys .",
    "in particular , the different doping regimes are obtained in a natural way .",
    "we recall that our study involved only a single free parameter , @xmath118 , which was fixed for the undoped system and which does not directly affect the doping dependence or the gap anisotropy .    in agreement with experimental data ,",
    "the present calculation predicts for both alloys a stronger influence of doping on the @xmath13 gap , which follows approximately the doping dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "on contrast , the @xmath16 gap remains rather stable and only slowly decreases on doping .",
    "this is at variance with a previous _ ab initio _",
    "study based on the fully anisotropic gap equations by choi _",
    "@xcite , where doping was modeled by simply introducing excess electrons . for a moderate doping level of @xmath119 ( @xmath120 )",
    ", they found a severe degradation of the @xmath16 gap while the @xmath13 gap was more robust .",
    "this failure of a rigid - band - like type approach indicates that a more self - consistent site - dependent treatment of the doping is required for a proper description of the superconducting properties in doped mgb@xmath2 .",
    "two previous computational studies @xcite of the superconducting properties of mgb@xmath2 alloys adopted a scaling scheme to describe the doping dependence .",
    "the eliashberg functions for the undoped compound were scaled taking into account the doping dependence of @xmath84 and of the @xmath18 phonon frequency .",
    "as such an approach does not discriminate between the doping sites , kortus _",
    "_ @xcite argued that the differences observed for al and c doping are due to a larger interband scattering for c than for al doping .",
    "the present study , however , demonstrates that the difference between al and c doping appears naturally within the vca approach , without the need to introduce another free parameter such as the interband scattering , as long as the influence of doping on the structure and on the lattice dynamics is properly taken into account .",
    "we have performed a _",
    "first - principles _ study of the electron - phonon coupling and superconducting properties for the mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath2 and mgb@xmath3c@xmath4 alloys as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively , by combining the self - consistent virtual - crystal approximation and the two - band eliashberg model . for undoped mgb@xmath2 ,",
    "the eliashberg function possess a main peak at around 70 mev related to the @xmath18-phonon mode coming from the @xmath49 contribution , and a sharper peak at 90 mev which originates largely from the @xmath48 contribution , and is related to the @xmath72-phonon mode .",
    "the total coupling constant @xmath121 agrees with the experimental value of @xmath122 as deduced from tunneling measurements . for the alloys we found that @xmath123 depends very sensitively on doping .",
    "it exhibits pronounced changes both in shape and in position of its main peaks , which renders any attempt to derive it from the spectrum of undoped mgb@xmath2 via scaling procedures very unreliable",
    ". the calculated evolution of the eliashberg functions compare well with recent electron tunneling spectroscopy measurements on al - doped thin films .",
    "the e - ph coupling parameter and its different contributions decrease as a function of doping for both alloys . although both al and c dopants donate electrons , the e - ph coupling exhibits a clear dependence on the doping site , which is also reflected in @xmath80 . with",
    "the coulomb pseudopotential fixed for the undoped compound , we could reproduce the experimental doping dependence of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for both alloys .",
    "the observed differences between al and c doping , like the doping range of superconductivity , are naturally obtained in the present vca approach , without the need to invoke other factors , as , e.g. , interband scattering .",
    "these results emphasize that a quantitative description of the superconducting properties of the two mgb@xmath2 alloys require a proper treatment of the doping at least on the level of vca , and suggest that interband scattering plays only a minor role .",
