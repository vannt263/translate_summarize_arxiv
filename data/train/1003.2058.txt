    "a fundamental understanding of the physical processes controlling the complex space- and time - dependent behavior of the carrier dynamics in reduced dimensions is essential to assess the technological potential of a variety of nanomaterials for future high - speed electronic devices . such assessment , however , requires both experimental and theoretical techniques by which high - frequency material properties , such as the dynamic ( ac ) conductance , can be measured or calculated .",
    "experimentally , much progress has been made in developing techniques to probe the rf response of nanomaterials . among these nanomaterials ,",
    "carbon nanotubes have received much attention due to their exceptional electronic transport properties at dc,@xcite and the hope that these carry over to high frequencies .",
    "measurements of the high - frequency characteristics of carbon nanotube field - effect transistors ( ntfets ) @xcite indicate little decrease in performance up to gigahertz ( ghz ) frequencies .",
    "in addition , the carrier dynamics in the terahertz ( thz ) regime was recently probed using time - domain techniques , suggesting that the carrier dynamics is determined by single - particle rather than plasmonic properties.@xcite    theoretically , the problem of time - dependent transport has been approached using a variety of techniques such as scattering matrix theory , @xcite floquet methods,@xcite boltzmann transport theory,@xcite and nonequilibrium green functions ( negf).@xcite even though the negf technique has become to some extent the standard in modeling electronic quantum transport , its application to time - dependent problems has been mainly focused on simplified few - level models , @xcite or to few - atom one - dimensional wires or molecules.@xcite while such model systems are invaluable to gain insight into the basic dynamic processes of simple quantum systems , it can be difficult to relate them to more realistic devices for three main reasons .",
    "first , the self - consistency between the charge and the potential is needed to properly determine the operation of the device in the presence of dynamic potentials .",
    "second , it is necessary to capture the rather complex dielectric environment of real devices .",
    "third , most approaches have focused on applying time - dependent signals at the source - drain , _",
    "i.e. _ transport terminals , @xcite rather than at the gate , a _ non - transport _ terminal .",
    "physically , non - transport terminals do not supply the device region with charge , unlike source - drain contacts , but are coupled to the device channel only through the ( self - consistent ) dynamic potential , which plays a similar role as the pumping potential in the field of parametric pumping.@xcite    in this work , we make a first step towards solving this problem and develop a linear response theory for ac quantum transport employing nonequilibrium green functions solved self - consistently with poisson s equation , when a time - dependent signal is applied at the gate terminal .",
    "we apply the approach to a ntfet and determine its high - frequency response , showing that the approach can not only describe time - dependent , single - particle quantum transport effects , but also is able to capture the plasmonic excitations of the device .",
    "the program of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we detail the formal theory for ac quantum transport and derive an effective dyson equation describing the dynamics of the system for a time - harmonic signal at a non - transport terminal .",
    "special attention is given to the practical calculation of the frequency - dependent charge density for which we develop a computationally efficient scheme , a prerequisite for calculating the self - consistent ac response of larger systems , as we have demonstrated previously.@xcite in sec .",
    "iii , general expressions for the ac particle current and associated conductance are derived along with a brief outline of the current partitioning scheme , @xcite and how it applies to a multi - terminal device with non - transport terminals . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply the theory to a ntfet .",
    "there , we discuss details of the significance of the operation mode of the device , and the self - consistent feedback between charge and potential for collective excitations .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec . v.",
    "in this section we describe the development of the ac approach , which consists of three steps : 1 ) definition of the model hamiltonian of the total system , 2 ) formulating the quantum dynamics and non - equilibrium statistics in terms of green functions in the energy domain , and 3 ) self - consistent calculation of the ac charge and potential .",
    "we begin by specifying the hamiltonian operator of the system . as usual , the total system is divided into three isolated regions following the partitioning scheme of caroli and co - workers@xcite the hamiltonian of the entire infinite system is written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian for the device region , @xmath2 refers to the two semi - infinite leads , and @xmath3 couples the device region to the leads . in a site representation",
    "the device hamiltonian is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 refer to fermionic creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath9 .",

    "the electron - electron interaction is approximated on the hartree level and has two components @xmath11 and @xmath12 , cf .",
    "eq  ( [ eq : hamdevu ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath13 represents a spatially - varying , but time-_independent _ electrostatic potential , such as the one present when calculating the dc properties and leads to a renormalization of the onsite energies @xmath14 .",
    "the new physics studied here originates from the presence of an _ a priori unknown _ time- and space-_dependent _ potential @xmath15 induced by externally applied time - dependent fields . as further discussed below , both @xmath13 and @xmath15 must be determined separately by solving poisson s equation in a self - consistent manner . in general , the approach allows to investigate the dynamic response beyond the hartree approximation of the coulomb interaction by including exchange and correlation functionals@xcite calculated self - consistently .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two contacts to the left and right ( @xmath16 ) of the device reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are fermionic creation and anihilation operators for a particle in terminal @xmath20 in state @xmath21 .",
    "we note that equations ( [ eq : hamdev0 ] ) , ( [ eq : hamdevu ] ) , and ( [ eqhamcon ] ) differ from those considered previously where a time - dependent source - drain bias is considered , in which case the onsite energy @xmath22 of the contacts become time - dependent rather than the ones of the device .",
    "finally , the hamiltonian @xmath23 couples the device sub - space with the semi - infinite source and drain reservoirs , and allows for a physical exchange of particles through the device - contact interface .",
    "therefore , the tunneling hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eqhamtun ] ) describes only the coupling between the device and _ transport _ terminals , but not to _ non - transport _ terminals .",
    "the next step is to describe the carrier dynamics within the device scattering region using green functions .",

    "in addition , whenever regular functions appear with green functions in the same equation , we also omit the spatial dependence on the regular functions .",

    "in our case , the self - energy @xmath30 can be divided into three contributions @xmath31 the first term @xmath32 is the contact self - energy and corresponds to the quantum - transport open - boundary conditions connecting the device region with the semi - infinite source and drain contacts .",
    "the second term is a scalar potential and represents the internal response of the device to externally applied time-_independent _ fields .",
    "the third term is the prominent feature in the ac theory presented here , and describes the _ dynamic _ response of the device due to external time-_dependent _ fields .",

    "this implies that the induced potential @xmath33 distorts only the device scattering region , while the contacts remain in steady - state .",
