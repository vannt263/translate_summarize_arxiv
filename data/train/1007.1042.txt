    "m33 is a suitable galaxy for studies of its stellar constituents .",
    "+ there have been a number of m33 cluster catalogs published since the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "an extensive and complete catalog can be found in the work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sm ) , which merged all of the modern catalogs compiled before 2007 .",
    "the catalogs that have appeared after the publication of sm have been incorporated into the web - based version of the sm catalog .",
    "this updated version of the catalog contains 595 candidates of which 349 are confirmed clusters based on _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and high - resolution ground - based imaging .",
    "the most recent work in this field corresponds to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zkh ) using the megacam camera on cfht .",
    "this study presents a catalog of 4,780 extended sources in a 1 deg@xmath6 region around m33 which includes 3,554 new candidate stellar clusters . +",
    "as pointed out by sm , the sample of clusters in m33 suffers from significant incompleteness . while _",
    "hst _ and its several instruments have been successfully used in the search for star clusters , the small field of view permits surveys only over a limited region of the galaxy . with the most recent contribution of zkh , this area has been increased to 1 deg@xmath6 centered on m33 . however , as we discussed in @xcite , the zkh catalog has largely overestimated the number of clusters , due to a possible systematic misidentification , where only around 40@xmath7 of the 3554 proposed candidates are likely to be actual stellar clusters . for these reasons",
    "we have undertaken the present study .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations and data reduction while section 3 discusses the adopted search method and the integrated photometry of the clusters .",
    "the analysis of the photometric properties and comparison with other galaxies are in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 presents a summary .",
    "the observations for the present study were obtained using the queue service observing mode at the 3.6 m canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the data are available on - line through _ the canadian astronomy data centre _ archive and were obtained as part of `` the m33 cfht variability survey '' @xcite .",
    "the images were taken using the megacam / megaprime wide - field mosaic imager which contains 36 individual ccds that combine to offer nearly a full @xmath0x @xmath0 field of view with a high angular resolution of 0.187pixel@xmath8 .",
    "megacam operates with a set of griz filters very similar to those of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) but a slightly different near - uv filter called u@xmath9 .",
    "this filter was designed to maximize the capabilities of the instrument at short wavelengths and its effective wavelength is @xmath2 200 @xmath10 redder than the standard u filter .",
    "all of the archival images were pre - processed by the cfht s elixir project .",
    "this pipeline includes the standard steps of overscan and bias subtraction , flat - fielding , fringe correction , masking of bad pixels and merging of amplifiers .",
    "the elixir project also provides a preliminary photometric calibration for each image . + in order to facilitate the search for cluster candidates , only the best available images were analyzed consisting of 15 u@xmath9 , 15 g , 14 r , 28 i and 3 z. median seeing values of all analyzed images are @xmath1 0.8  in g , r and i filters and @xmath2 0.6  in u@xmath9 and z. prior to the data analysis , each field of 36 individual ccds were combined into a single master image .",
    "this process was done using the software module swarp 2.16.14 of the terapix pipeline which is mainly dedicated to the processing of megacam data .",
    "this specific module involves resampling of the individual images as well as co - adding the different exposures in an optimum way so that the point - spread function ( psf ) is not distorted ( * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "each final combined master image was divided into two sub - fields , including an overlapping area , to deal with the spatial variability of the psf .",
    "+ the m33 images are extremely crowded making the construction of point - spread functions quite challenging . in order to perform accurate standard profile - fitting photometry , we used daophot / allstar routines @xcite in an iterative way .",
    "first , we found all of the stars on each image and produced small - aperture photometry for them .",
    "we then used the daophot / pick routine to select a set of 1000 reasonable candidates to be used as psf stars .",
    "after deleting those with bad pixels nearby , we subtracted the stars with surrounding neighbors to help isolate the psf stars . the resulting list of more than 500 stars , in all cases ,",
    "was used to create a psf for each of the images .",
    "the shape of the psf was made to vary quadratically with position on the frame . to improve the psf",
    ", we created an image where all the neighbors and stars that do not fit the first psf were subtracted , obtaining an improved second - generation psf over this subtracted image .",
    "appropriate aperture corrections were calculated from isolated unsaturated bright stars with photometric errors smaller than 0.01 mag .",
    "since the correction varies with radius from the center of the images , a polynomial fit was applied to the aperture corrections in order to obtain the final instrumental magnitudes .",
    "all frames were matched using daomatch / daomaster routines to obtain common stars in all filters .",
    "following @xcite , the photometric calibration provided by the elixir pipeline was applied using the zero - point values . in addition and to deal with the differences between u@xmath9 and u , we applied the equations from @xcite to transform the photometry from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . + the integrated magnitudes and colors for each candidate cluster",

    "@xcite , we have adopted an aperture radius of 2.2  for the magnitude measurements and 1.5  for the colors .",
    "the background sky is always determined in an annulus with an inner radius of 3.5  and an outer radius of 5.0  .",
    "no aperture corrections have been applied to the extended objects , such as the star cluster candidates .",
    "once again , these magnitudes have been photometrically calibrated to the sdss standard system . to derive accurate positions of the clusters and to estimate properties such as ellipticity and full width at half maximum ( fwhm )",
    ", we have applied the sextractor v2.5.0 @xcite image classification algorithm .",
    "our detection method is based on the fact that at the distance of m33 , non - stellar objects are expected to be more extended than the psf . after subtracting the stellar psf from all of the sources in our frames , extended objects",
    "leave a doughnut - shaped appearance , as they are under - subtracted in the wings and over - subtracted in the center .",
    "we have used daophot / allstar @xcite to produce residual images free of all psf sources .",

    "[ mosaic ] shows original and residual images of different types of extended objects .",

    "however , from the 349 guaranteed clusters listed in the updated sm catalog , our catalog only recovers 204 objects implying missing objects mostly in the center of the galaxy , not surprising since the method is less effective in extremely crowded regions .",
    "+ comparison with the similar study of zkh reveals unexpected discrepancies . from the total 1,752 common objects between both catalogs , only 124 sources were classified as candidate clusters by both authors . as @xcite argue , the total number of true cluster candidates in the zkh catalog is not likely to be larger than @xmath2 40%",
    "this suggests a systematic misidentification in the candidate object pattern or a defective psf subtraction .",

    ", @xcite found a large population of @xmath1 10 myr star clusters with strong nebular emission , similar to the one found in the present study .",
    "the main galaxies that make up hgc 31 are disrupted under the presence of strong gravitational interactions and show tidal structures .",
    "the star cluster candidates with nebular emission appear throughout hcg31 , specifically concentrated in the interaction regions .",
    "the existence of these very young star clusters seems to be the consequence of active recent and ongoing star formation in hgc 31 .",
    "the similarities between the m33 cluster system and that of hgc 31 , which is a strongly interacting environment , support two important assertions .",
    "first , the finger - like feature is a genuine characteristic and not an artificial effect due to the contamination of our cluster sample .",
    "second , the past interactions between m33 and m31 have likely had significant impact on the properties of the m33 cluster system , especially the youngest clusters .      in order to analyze the spatial distribution of clusters with different ages ,",

    "this partition minimizes the contamination of the old ( red ) clusters by the young clusters in the finger - like feature which exhibit integrated colors that are redder than expected . in order to place the cluster density distribution in the context of the field stars , we have made use of the @xcite star catalog constructed over the same megacam / cfht images used in the present study .",
    "[ cumulative ] shows the cumulative radial distributions of the young and old cluster populations as compared with the blue ( young ) and red ( old ) field star populations .",
    "blue clusters follow a spatial distribution similar to the blue field stars .",
    "the distribution also suggests that younger ( bluer ) clusters are more centrally concentrated as compared with older ( redder ) clusters .",
    "the red clusters are more dispersed in a wider region than the bluer ones , indicating that the majority of the red ( old ) clusters likely belong to the halo while the bluer ( younger ) clusters generally belong to the disk of m33 .",
    "analysis of these distributions using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k  s ) test shows that there is a greater than 99.9@xmath7 chance that the old cluster population is significantly different than the young cluster population .",
    "[ radial_distribution ] shows the radial density distribution of our entire cluster sample .",
    "the filled circles show the cluster density profile versus deprojected radius , assuming our adopted distance modulus of @xmath18=24.69 , while the open circles show the confirmed clusters from sm for comparison .",
    "the small dots correspond with the radial density distribution of the field stars where the solid line represents the best polynomial fit .",
    "the star density distribution has been scaled to match the cluster density in the region between r=0.6  2 kpc where both distributions are likely to have similar completeness levels .",
    "+ inside @xmath2 0.8 kpc , the cluster profile presents a decrease in density , suggesting some level of incompleteness .",
    "the cluster profile outside of @xmath2 2.5 kpc could be reproduced by a power - law where the most distant clusters are located at @xmath2 15 kpc ( 63 arcmin ) from the center of the galaxy .",
    "confirmed clusters from sm show that the m33 cluster system seems to be more centrally concentrated than the field stars , however no other galaxy has been found with this characteristic @xcite .",
    "our radial profiles , shown in fig . [ radial_distribution ] , have reduced the discrepancy between the clusters and field stars but the former are still more centrally concentrated than the latter as shown by the cumulative distributions in fig .",
    "[ cumulative ] . the pronounced decrease at @xmath2 15 kpc in the cluster and field - star density distributions suggest that this distance may represent the outer edge of both distributions . for a given radial bin in the outer region of the galaxy ,",
    "the density of clusters is significantly lower than the density of stars .",
    "we note the possibility that the cluster and stellar samples may have different completeness properties . in order to minimize the potential impact of incompleteness",
    ", we restrict the comparison of these samples to the region outside @xmath2 0.8 kpc from the center of the galaxy . if the incompleteness of our sample is the reason for the differences between the cluster and field star radial profiles , then we would expect a random bias or perhaps a larger incompleteness toward the center of the galaxy .",
    "however , the analysis shows a significantly lower density of clusters between r = 3  9 kpc than in the inner region between r=0.8  3 kpc .",
    "the ratio of stars to clusters is determined not only by the formation processes but also by the destruction processes . if we assume that the formation of star clusters and the formation of stars in a galaxy are correlated , then fig .",
    "[ radial_distribution ] suggests that the cluster system in m33 has suffered from destruction or depletion of clusters at specific radii .",
    "tidal interactions when passing through the disk or near massive objects such as giant molecular clouds could produce tidal shocks that lead to the ultimate destruction of a cluster ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the dynamical evolution of these clusters is needed to reveal the level of influence of these interactions in the disruption process .",
    "other environment effects such as interactions between m33 and m31 can also play a role in the depletion or disruption of clusters at preferred galactocentric distances .",
    "@xcite discovered the presence of four new outlying star clusters in m33 which have large projected radii of 38  113 arcmin ( 9.6  28.5 kpc ) .",
    "based on the asymmetry in the distribution of these outer clusters , they suggest the possibility that interactions with m31 may have dramatically affected the population of m33 star clusters .",
    "regardless of the source of this anomaly , we would need an additional @xmath2 350 clusters between r=3  9 kpc in order to match the stellar density in the same region of the galaxy .",
    "if we rescale the density of stars to match the cluster density in the outer region , a notable excess of clusters occurs at r @xmath1 4 kpc .",
    "this scenario is highly unlikely since dynamical destruction processes are more effective near the central region of a galaxy .",
    "the short lifetime of such a young sample of clusters also makes the cluster migration scenario implausible",
    ". no case has been found in which the cluster density exceeds the star density in the inner region of a galaxy .",
    "future follow - ups of this sample will test the validity of the depletion phenomenon that could have widespread repercussions for our understanding of m33 s formation and evolution .",
    "we present a wide - field photometric survey of m33 extended objects using cfht/ megacam images .",
    "the resultant catalog contains 2,990 extended sources , including 599 new candidate stellar clusters and 204 previously identified clusters .",
    "we have investigated the photometric properties of the cluster sample , performing _ ugriz _ integrated photometry and using their morphological parameters . based on the properties of confirmed star clusters , we select a sub - sample of 246 highly probable objects .",
    "analysis of multicolor photometry of the candidate clusters reveals a wide range of colors including a finger - like feature in the color - color diagrams that deviates from the expected direction of evolution .",
    "color distributions of the cluster sample reveal a unimodal distribution .",
    "a comparison of the radial density distribution for the field stars and our cluster sample suggests that the m33 cluster system suffers from a depletion of clusters at all radii .",
    "color - color diagrams also reveal a gap in the distribution of star clusters similar to the gap detected among lmc clusters .",
