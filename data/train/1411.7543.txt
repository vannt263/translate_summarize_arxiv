    "surface states play an extremely important role in the physics of topologically nontrivial states of matter , such as the topological insulators @xcite and the weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "e.g. the nonzero conductivity of the topological insulators is saturated by topologically protected gapless excitations .",
    "the hallmark of the weyl semimetal phase is the emergence of the fermi arc in the spectrum of surface states , which is an open line of zero energy surface states joining the projections of the bulk weyl nodes onto the boundary brillouin zone .",
    "a beautiful argument relating 3d weyl semimetals and 2d @xmath0 topological insulators shows that fermi arcs are also topologically protected @xcite .",
    "the aim of these notes is to provide a simple ( and hopefully pedagogical ) derivation of the spectrum of surface states within the low - energy effective model of topological insulators and weyl semimetals , which is nothing but the continuum dirac hamiltonian . in section ( [ sec : surface_states_general ] ) we start with a general recipe for computing the spectrum of surface states , introducing the wave function of an ideal insulator as the boundary condition for the wave functions of any surface state .",
    "we then consider the simplest example of the surface states of a 3d @xmath0 topological insulator , modelled by a dirac hamiltonian with a negative mass term .",
    "in section [ sec : bs_mua ] we consider the spectrum of surface states of a massive dirac hamiltonian with weyl nodes which have different energies . in this case",
    "the surface states only exist if the dirac mass term is negative , as for @xmath0 topological insulators .",
    "the dispersion relation of the surface states is simply the isotropic dirac cone with the fermi velocity which decreases as the energy separation between the weyl nodes grows .    in section",
    "[ sec : bs_b ] we study surface states of a dirac hamiltonian with the momentum separation between the weyl nodes . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : fermiarcs_massless ] we consider the simplest case of massless dirac fermions and demonstrate the existence of the fermi arc in the surface state spectrum .",
    "after that we consider massive dirac fermions and find that the surface states interpolate in a nontrivial way between the fermi arc - like and the dirac cone - like dispersion relations . in particular , surface states exist only in a finite range of momenta in the surface brillouin zone for all nonzero values of the dirac mass and the momentum separating the weyl nodes . when the momentum separation between the weyl nodes is equal to the dirac mass , the spectrum of surface states becomes purely one - dimensional .",
    "in these notes we will consider the single - particle three - dimensional dirac hamiltonians of the following form @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the dirac @xmath3-matrices , @xmath4 label spatial coordinates and @xmath5 is some hermitian matrix with two spinor indices which might in general depend on the coordinates .",
    "for example , the dirac mass term corresponds to @xmath6 .",
    "the dirac hamiltonians of such a general form provide a reasonably accurate low - energy description of 3d @xmath0 topological insulators and weyl semimetals .    in the following we will consider the hamiltonian ( [ dirachamiltoniangeneral ] ) as a low - energy description of some crystal which hosts dirac quasiparticles and which fills the infinite half - space @xmath7 such that there is a flat boundary at @xmath8 between the crystal and the vacuum .",
    "moreover , we assume that at @xmath9 and @xmath10 the matrices @xmath11 do not have any coordinate dependence , and denote @xmath12 for @xmath7 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "we are then interested in the surface states of the hamiltonian ( [ dirachamiltoniangeneral ] ) confined to the plane @xmath8 , in a sense that their wave functions decay as @xmath15 for @xmath16 and as @xmath17 for @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "for real crystals there should be also a factor of fermi velocity @xmath21 in front of the derivative term in ( [ dirachamiltoniangeneral ] ) .",
    "however , it can be absorbed into the rescaling of @xmath5 and the energy spectrum , and is not important for the following discussion .",
    "since the system is translationally invariant in the @xmath22 plane , we can partially diagonalize the hamiltonian in the plane wave basis @xmath23 .",
    "we then get the following equation for the eigenstates of @xmath24 : @xmath25 where small latin indices are used to label the two transverse coordinates : @xmath26 . from the last equation above we immediately conclude that the coefficients @xmath27 which determine the decay of the wave function of the surface state away from the surface are the eigenvalues of the constant , space - independent @xmath28 matrices @xmath29 the corresponding eigenvectors are the dirac spinors @xmath30 , for which we assume the normalization @xmath31 . the solution of the equation ( [ eigenstateequationgeneral ] ) can be then written in the following general form : @xmath32 the normalization condition for the wave function ( [ boundarystategeneralwf ] ) reads @xmath33 in addition , in order to satisfy the equation ( [ eigenstateequationgeneral ] ) we have to require the continuity of the wave function across the boundary at @xmath8 , which gives the condition @xmath34 . taking into account that @xmath30 are by definition normalized to unity , we conclude that the absolute values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 should be equal , and that the spinors @xmath37 and @xmath38 should be equal up to a phase : @xmath39 with @xmath40 .    we thus conclude that the surface states exist if one can find such @xmath41 that the two matrices @xmath42 have matching eigenvectors @xmath39 for which the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath27 satisfy @xmath19 , @xmath20 .      in practice , one is often interested in the surface states which live on the boundary between some topologically nontrivial material and the vacuum , which can be thought of as an `` ideal '' insulator .",
    "since we know that in the vacuum the electrons are described by the dirac hamiltonian with a huge ( as compared to typical scales in condensed matter physics ) mass of @xmath43 , we can model the vacuum electron hamiltonian as the dirac hamiltonian ( [ dirachamiltoniangeneral ] ) with @xmath44 , assuming that the typical electron momenta and energies are much less than @xmath45 . strictly speaking",
    ", we should also take into account that inside the crystal the electron moves with a fermi velocity @xmath21 , and outside - with the speed of light . at the level of the eigenstate equations ( [ eigenstateequationgeneral ] ) ,",
    "however , the difference of the fermi velocities will only result in a rescaling of @xmath45 by @xmath21 , which will still be very large as compared to other scales in the problem .",
    "we will therefore assume that at @xmath14 we have a vacuum , and calculate the eigenstate of the corresponding matrix @xmath46 in ( [ mmatrixdef ] ) with positive real part of the eigenvalue , assuming @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "writing the matrix @xmath46 and its eigenstate @xmath49 in the chiral block form , we obtain the following eigenstate equation : @xmath50 or , individually for each of the chiral components @xmath51 , @xmath52 : @xmath53 where we have denoted @xmath54 . combining the two above equations",
    ", we can express @xmath55 in terms of @xmath41 as @xmath56 .",
    "we have taken into account that the real part of @xmath55 should be positive and denoted @xmath57 . from ( [ iieigenequationblock2 ] )",
    "one can also read off the general form of the eigenstates of @xmath46 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the normalization factor and @xmath60 is an arbitrary normalized two - component weyl spinor which can have some momentum dependence .",
    "taking into account the smallness of @xmath41 and @xmath61 as compared to @xmath45 , we can write @xmath62 . we can also neglect @xmath41 and @xmath63 in the second component of ( [ iieigenequationblock2 ] ) .",
    "we conclude therefore that in the limit @xmath64 the eigenstates @xmath38 of @xmath46 have the following form : @xmath65 we call this spinor `` the wave function of an ideal insulator '' .",
    "we see that its form is completely independent of the momentum @xmath61 , the energy @xmath41 and the electron mass . by virtue of the continuity of the wave function at the boundary of material ,",
    "we conclude that all the surface states of any material bounded by the vacuum should have this structure .",
    "the nontrivial properties of the surface states are then encoded in the nontrivial momentum dependence of the weyl spinor @xmath60 .",
    "from now on we will always assume that the nontrivial material occupies the half - space at @xmath7 , and the vacuum is at @xmath14 . to shorten the notation , from now on we",
    "will also omit the subscript @xmath66 for the quantities characterizing the wave functions at @xmath7 as well as the surface momentum @xmath67 from the arguments of the wave functions .      in order to illustrate the application of the above formulae on the simplest possible example , in this subsection we consider the surface states of a 3d @xmath0 topological insulator , which at low energies can be modelled by the dirac hamiltonian with a negative mass term @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the eigenstate equation for the matrix @xmath69 has the same form as in ( [ iieigenequationblock1 ] ) with the replacement @xmath70 , and the corresponding eigenstates read @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath59 is some normalization constant . at the surface of the topological insulator",
    "this wave function should be equal to the wave function ( [ idealinsulatoreigenstate ] ) of an ideal insulator .",
    "these boundary conditions immediately lead to the following linear equation for @xmath73 : @xmath74 the consistency condition for these linear equations yield the equation from which one can find the energies @xmath41 of the surface states : @xmath75 note that for this solution the real part of @xmath76 is only negative if the dirac mass @xmath68 is negative , that is , if our material has a nontrivial @xmath0 topological index with respect to the vacuum , which we have characterized by the ideal insulator wave function ( [ idealinsulatoreigenstate ] ) .",
    "of course only the relative sign of the dirac mass in the vacuum and in the material is important , and the assumption that the dirac mass in the vacuum is positive is merely a conventional choice @xcite .",
    "we thus see that the dispersion relation of the surface states of a 3d @xmath0 topological insulator is simply the dirac cone with unit fermi velocity : @xmath77    substituting now the expressions ( [ eigenstate3_ti ] ) into ( [ eigenstate2_ti ] ) , we immediately see that the weyl spinor @xmath73 is the eigenstate of the spin operator @xmath63 : @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath79 encodes the spin polarization of the surface states , we conclude that for 3d @xmath0 topological insulators the spin of the surface states is always aligned with the momentum .",
    "this is the famous spin - momentum locking mechanism , which prevents backscattering of surface states at impurities which can not flip the spin ( e.g. the non - magnetic impurities ) . indeed",
    ", the back - scattered wave should have opposite orientations of both the momentum and the spin , but the processes of spin flips are highly suppressed in the absence of magnetization .    for completeness ,",
    "let us also remark that in real 3d topological insulators the spin of the surface states is actually not aligned , but rather perpendicular to the momentum .",
    "this is simply the consequence of the fact that for real 3d @xmath0 topological insulators the kinetic term in the effective dirac hamiltonian should be written as @xmath80 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this specific permutation of @xmath81 and @xmath82 indices in the dirac hamiltonian is a direct reflection of a strong spin - orbital coupling , an important feature of all topological insulators .",
    "however , as long as one is interested only in the energy spectrum of the surface states , one can use the form @xmath83 which is common in high - energy physics and which only differs from @xmath80 by a redefinition of pauli @xmath84-matrices .",
    "let us now consider a more nontrivial example of a massive dirac hamiltonian for which the left- and the right - handed weyl nodes have different energies .",
    "such hamiltonian might serve as a low - energy effective theory of a weyl semimetal with broken parity @xcite .",
    "in particular , such a material should support the chiral magnetic effect @xcite . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that the energies of the weyl nodes are @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the chiral chemical potential @xcite .",
    "we now consider the case when the space at @xmath14 is an ideal insulator ( see the above section ) , and the space at @xmath7 is characterized by some mass term @xmath68 and the chiral chemical potential @xmath86 . in this case the bulk hamiltonian in momentum space and the corresponding matrix @xmath11 in ( [ dirachamiltoniangeneral ] ) have the form @xmath87 the bulk energy spectrum which corresponds to such a dirac hamiltonian is @xmath88 the eigenvalue equation for the matrix @xmath69 in ( [ mmatrixdef ] ) in this case has the form @xmath89 or , in a component - wise form @xmath90 for simplicity , we assume now that we are interested in the low - energy excitations with @xmath91",
    ". then the compatibility condition for the equations ( [ eigenstateequation_mua_components ] ) leads to the following two values of @xmath76 with negative real parts : @xmath92 where we assume that @xmath93 .",
    "we see that in the presence of the chiral chemical potential @xmath86 @xmath94 acquire some nonzero imaginary part .",
    "moreover , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are now complex conjugate . remembering that the wave functions of the surface states depend on the `` depth '' coordinate @xmath97 as @xmath98 , we conclude that now the wave functions of the surface states should exhibit some oscillations as they decay at large @xmath97 .    by a direct substitution one can check that @xmath99 and @xmath100 should be proportional to the eigenvectors @xmath101 of the operator @xmath102 : @xmath103 where in the last line we have used the identity @xmath104 which follows from ( [ lambda_mua ] ) . up to normalization @xmath101 can be written as @xmath105 using ( [ eigenstateequation_mua_components ] ) , we can now find the eigenvectors of @xmath69 which correspond to the eigenvalues ( [ lambda_mua ] ) : @xmath106 since @xmath107 , @xmath108 are the two independent eigenstates of @xmath69 with negative real parts , the wave functions of surface states can be expressed as some linear combination of @xmath107 : @xmath109 . in order to satisfy the continuity of the wave function , we have to require that at @xmath8 @xmath110 is equal to the ideal insulator wave function ( [ idealinsulatoreigenstate ] ) .",
    "this immediately leads to the following equations : @xmath111 using now the explicit form of @xmath101 , we arrive at the following system of equations for @xmath112 : @xmath113 these equations are compatible if @xmath114 the real values of @xmath41 at which this equation is satisfied are the energies of the surface states . using the explicit form of @xmath115 from ( [ psi_mua ] ) and @xmath116 from ( [ eta_components_mua ] ) , after some algebra",
    "we can rewrite the above equation as @xmath117 taking into account that @xmath95 and @xmath96 are complex conjugate and that @xmath68 , @xmath41 , @xmath118 and @xmath86 are real , one can easily see that the above equation is equivalent to @xmath119 from the first equation it becomes obvious again that the surface states only exist if @xmath120 .",
    "this means that surface states only exist if the weyl semimetal is simultaneously also the @xmath0 topological insulator .",
    "these features in fact do not contradict each other , since the dispersion relation ( [ bulk_spectrum_mua ] ) features both the weyl nodes at the energies @xmath121 and the gap of size @xmath122 centered around @xmath123 . while the conventional ohmic conductivity vanishes at zero temperature because of this gap ,",
    "the chiral magnetic conductivity is still nonzero due to the existence of weyl nodes @xcite .    in order to find the energies @xmath41 of surface states",
    ", we have now to solve the equation @xmath124 squaring both the r.h.s . and the l.h.s . of this equation",
    "we finally arrive at the following dispersion relation for the surface states in the presence of chiral chemical potential : @xmath125 we see that the dispersion relation at nonzero chiral chemical potential is still the dirac cone , and the only effect of the chiral chemical potential is to decrease the fermi velocity @xmath126 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fermi velocity of the surface states appears to be different ( and larger for @xmath127 ) than the bulk fermi velocity @xmath128 , which according to ( [ bulk_spectrum_mua ] ) is equal to @xmath129",
    "in this section we consider the case of dirac hamiltonian with momentum separation between the weyl nodes .",
    "such a hamiltonian provides a low - energy effective description of time - reversal breaking weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "physically , momentum separation between the weyl nodes can be achieved , for example , by magnetic doping of a 3d topological insulator @xcite .",
    "direct signatures of the momentum separation between the weyl nodes are the anomalous hall effect @xcite as well as the existence of the fermi arc in the spectrum of surface states - an open line of topologically protected zero energy states which joins the projections of the bulk weyl nodes onto the surface brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "we first illustrate the emergence of the fermi arc states in the simplest case of massless dirac fermions with weyl nodes at different momenta , and then consider the more general and complicated case of massive dirac fermions . while similar calculations were presented in @xcite , here we extend the analysis of the surface states also to the case when absolute value of the dirac mass is so large that the weyl nodes no longer exist and explicitly follow the interpolation between the fermi arc - like and the dirac cone - like dispersion relations .      for massless dirac fermions with weyl nodes at @xmath130 the bulk hamiltonian in the momentum space and the corresponding matrix @xmath11 in ( [ dirachamiltoniangeneral ] )",
    "have the form @xmath131 where we assume that @xmath132 .",
    "fermi arcs appear in the spectrum in this case if the boundary of the weyl semimetal is parallel to the @xmath22 plane , that is , exactly in the case which we consider .    with @xmath11 given by ( [ phiplus_farcs ] ) , the equations for the eigenstates @xmath133 of @xmath69 can be written as @xmath134 from these equations , we find two independent solutions with negative real @xmath76 : @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are some normalization factors .",
    "taking into account that for the vacuum boundary conditions ( [ idealinsulatoreigenstate ] ) @xmath138 , we can write the following equation for the general solution which should be representable as some linear combination of @xmath139 and @xmath140 : @xmath141 after some simple algebraic transformations we find the following equation for @xmath41 : @xmath142 or , in somewhat more explicit form @xmath143 it is now easy to guess the following solution to this equation : @xmath144 this is the fermi arc solution .",
    "we see that there is a line of zero energy joining the projections of the bulk weyl nodes onto the surface momentum space .",
    "the dispersion relation is effectively one - dimensional in the direction perpendicular to the separation between the weyl nodes .",
    "moreover , surface states only exist in a finite strip in momentum space with @xmath145 .",
    "we now consider the more general case of massive dirac hamiltonian with the time - reversal breaking terms of the form ( [ phiplus_farcs ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the momentum - space bulk hamiltonian and the matrix @xmath11 in ( [ dirachamiltoniangeneral ] ) have the form @xmath146 the bulk dispersion relation of this hamiltonian is @xcite : @xmath147 physically , such hamiltonian describes a @xmath0 3d topological insulator with magnetic doping which explicitly breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it is important to note that the distance between the weyl nodes is now @xmath148 rather than @xmath149 .",
    "thus the dirac mass term tends to move the weyl nodes together and eventually annihilates them if @xmath150 .",
    "if the dirac mass @xmath68 is negative , this situation corresponds to the 3d topological insulator for which the magnetic doping is still small compared to the topological mass gap @xmath68 .",
    "let us now study the surface states for such a hamiltonian .",
    "partly this has been done in @xcite , but here we extend the analysis also to the case of large negative dirac masses with @xmath151 in order to see how the dirac cone dispersion relation ( [ dirac_cone_2d ] ) typical for the surface states of 3d topological insulators transforms into the fermi arc - like dispersion relation ( [ energy_farcs ] ) typical for weyl semimetals as the parameter @xmath152 is tuned across the critical value @xmath153 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the matrix @xmath69 now has the form @xmath154 or , in a component - wise form @xmath155 substituting the first equation into the second one , we obtain the following equation for @xmath99 : @xmath156 } - k^2 + \\lambda^2 - m^2 \\right ) } \\phi = 0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see thus that @xmath99 should be the eigenstate of the operator @xmath157 } - i \\lambda { \\left [ \\sigma_z , { b \\!\\!\\!/ } \\right ] } $ ] , which can be written as the following @xmath158 matrix : @xmath159 the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath160 , with @xmath108 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors have the following form , up to normalization : @xmath161 where in the last line we have used the explicit expression for @xmath76 in terms of @xmath84 ( [ lambda_b ] ) , given below . substituting this expression for @xmath162 into the first equation ( [ eigenstateequation_b_components ] ) , we also find @xmath163 : @xmath164 substituting the eigenstates of @xmath165 into ( [ eigenstateequation_b_phi1 ] ) , we obtain the following equation for @xmath76 : @xmath166 the solutions of this equation with negative real part are given by @xmath167 the square root in the brackets ( inside the outer square root ) can in principle have an arbitrary sign . in order to match the expression for the component @xmath116 of @xmath162 given by the last line of ( [ phi_sigma_b ] ) , we have to set this sign to @xmath168 , assuming that @xmath169 .",
