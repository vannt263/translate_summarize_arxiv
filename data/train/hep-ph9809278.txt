    "pion interferometry is expected to provide important information about the space - time picture of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "it has already proved to be a sensitive tool for the detection of the collective motion of the matter created in the course of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to show that under favorable circumstances , interferometry is capable of detecting the difference between various mechanisms of freezeout which is the last transient phase before the regime of free streaming of hadrons .",
    "the effect we rely upon is entirely due to real interactions at the freezeout stage , and its magnitude may serve as a measure of these interactions .",
    "we predict that the normalized two - particle correlator of _ non - identical _ pions ( and even for pairs like @xmath0 , @xmath1 , etc . )",
    "must differ from the reference unit value at any difference @xmath2 of the pions momenta .",
    "the normalized correlator of identical pions does not approach unity at large @xmath2 and slightly exceeds value of 2 at @xmath3 .",
    "( in the idealized model which is used in this paper to _ demonstrate _ these effects , they are small . )",
    "the second goal is to discuss the effect of the multiparticle final states on the one- and two - pion inclusive spectra .",
    "we demonstrate that the contribution of these states depends on the microscopic dynamical mechanism of freezeout .",
    "we explicitly show that the effect of the multi - particle final states is limited by the actual range of the interactions at the freezeout stage .",
    "no particles , which are causally or ( and ) dynamically disconnected from the two - pion inclusive probe , can contribute this effect .",
    "our general conclusion is that the problem of the analysis of hbt data can not even be posed without reference to an explicit dynamical model .",
    "finally , our model may serve as a prototype of a realistic dynamical mechanism of freezeout , provided that the preceding stage of evolution is a hot gas of hadrons .",
    "our results can be used for the simulation of truly quantum two - pion distributions with the input from the event generators based on semi - classical dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : sn1 ] , the effect is explained at the introductory level .",
    "we pose the problem of interferometry ( in its most rigorous form ) as a problem of a quantum transition specified by the observables and the initial data in sec .",
    "[ sec : sn2 ] .",
    "[ sec : sn3 ] deals with the formulation of the pion interferometry problem and the results of calculations for the hydrodynamic theory of multiple production . a more realistic model of freezeout , which incorporates some elements of hadron kinetics ,",
    "is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : sn4 ] .",
    "the analytic answer for the model - based calculations is obtained by the end of this section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sn5 ] , we discuss the effect of multi - pion final states on the inclusive two - pion spectrum and speculate about physical phenomena that may lead to the increase of the effect .",
    "a practical issue of the event generator , with the built - in bose - einstein correlations , is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sn6 ] .",
    "the simplest and most popular introductory explanation of the principles of hbt interferometry is as follows : the amplitude to emit ( `` prepare '' ) the pion at the point @xmath4 and to detect it with the momentum @xmath5 is @xmath6 . ,",
    "which allows for two complementary interpretations : ( i ) the particle is _ prepared _ with momentum @xmath7 and _ detected _ at the point @xmath8 , or , equivalently , ( ii ) the particle is _ prepared _ at the point @xmath8 and _ detected _ with the momentum @xmath7 .",
    "the same interpretation remains valid for the entire hierarchy of the multi - particle wave functions , @xmath9 , etc .",
    "] for a system of two pions prepared at points @xmath4 and @xmath10 , and detected with the momenta @xmath5 and @xmath11 , the transition amplitude ( wave function ) is a superposition of two indistinguishable amplitudes , @xmath12 and for a system of distributed pion sources , the two - particle inclusive spectrum is @xmath13\\big\\}~. \\label{eq : e1.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this scheme carries an implicit assumption that the pions are truly independently _ created _ in the state of free propagation .",
    "unfortunately , in the literature , this property is mostly taken for granted , though in the real world , it takes place only in very special occasions .",
    "for example , independence of pion production in nuclear collisions has been used to describe bose - einstein correlations at bevalac energies when the excited nuclear matter is dominated by nucleons @xcite . in that case , the bremsstrahlung of pions , that accompanies scattering of nucleons , was suggested to provide independent pion sources .    at rhic energies ( 100 gev / nucleon )",
    ", we anticipate that the nuclear matter before the freezeout is totally dominated by pions and only very few nucleons are expected in the central rapidity region .",
    "there is a long - standing conjecture that the last form of the matter , before the freezeout , is a hot expanding hadronic gas .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the main type of interaction at the freezeout stage is the binary collisions of pions .",
    "therefore , the free propagation of any pion starts after it has experienced the `` last '' collision in the hadronic gas , and there is no really independent free pion production .",
    "indeed , in this case , at least four particles are involved in the interference process , because at least two particles appear in the final state in each binary collision . if two pions ( say , @xmath14 ) are detected , then there are at least two more undetected particles emerging from two different collisions , and these particles may be identical as well .",
    "thus , we encounter an additional ( hidden ) interference which affects the measured inclusive two - particle cross section",
    ". moreover , even if the detected particles are different ( e.g. , @xmath15 ) , their partners still may be identical ( e.g. , the process @xmath16 takes place at the coordinate @xmath4 , and @xmath17 takes place at the coordinate @xmath10 ) .",
    "therefore , if the last interaction is the binary collision in the pion gas , the nave scheme ( [ eq : e1.1 ] ) has to be modified . in this modified case",
    ", there are four interfering amplitudes , @xmath18 the expression for the two - particle spectrum thus becomes more complicated , @xmath19~\\big\\}~ ,    \\label{eq : e1.4 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and contains _ three _ interference terms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the first interference term corresponds to the familiar `` opened '' interference in the subsystem of the detected pions .",
    "it is present only if the detected pions are identical .",
    "the two other terms describe the `` hidden '' interference in the subsystem of undetected pions which , however , are unavoidable partners of the detected pions in the process of their creation in the final states .",
    "these terms are present even if the detected pions are different .",
    "in fact , we deal with the _ dynamically generated _ situation when the system of two pions is described by a density matrix and not by the wave function .",
    "when the dynamics of the system is driven by binary collisions , the two pions just can not be found in a pure state !    a full scenario of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is still absent and an understanding of the quantum kinetics from microscopic quantum field theory , rather than from semi - classical approach , is only beginning to emerge .",
    "currently , the most self - consistent scenario is based on an assumption that equilibration happens very early .",
    "then it becomes possible to appeal to the equation of state of nuclear matter at various stages of the scenario , starting from the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and ending up with the hadronic gas ( as is done , e.g. , in ref.@xcite . )",
    "if this is not the case ( no hadronic gas occurs ) , the pions may be created in the course of hadronization and immediately freely propagate . in this situation , it is more likely that the pions are created independently . thus , the difference between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e1.1 ] ) , ( [ eq : e1.2 ] ) and ( [ eq : e1.3 ] ) , ( [ eq : e1.4 ] ) becomes of practical importance .",
    "pion interferometry provides a tool which is capable of distinguishing between these two scenaria . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sn5 ] , we argue that the effect of hidden interference may become even stronger if the system approaches the freezeout stage with the `` soft '' equation of state when the correlation length is long ( as is , e.g. , in the vicinity of a phase transition ) .    furthermore , it is easy to understand that the correlations due to the hidden interference exist even , e.g. , between pions and protons , protons and neutrons , etc .",
    "all these effects , which may carry significant information about the freeze - out dynamics , require ( and deserve ) special study , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we insist that it is highly desirable ( though not easy ) either to measure all these correlation effects or to establish their absence at a high level of confidence .",
    "both results are important since they would allow one to constrain the full self - consistent scenario of heavy - ion collisions which is absent now .",
    "these constraints may also affect theoretical predictions of the photon and dilepton yields in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "a precise definition of observables is extremely important , because the hbt interferometry does not allow one to pose the mathematically unambiguous inverse problem . in general",
    ", we have to formulate a model and compare the solution with the data , relying on common sense and physical intuition .",
    "the full set of assumptions that accompany the formulation of the model is never articulated in full .",
    "particularly , the question about the nature of states in which the particles are created is never discussed .",
    "however , this is the key issue .",
    "interferometry is a consequence of the interference , and , in quantum mechanics , the latter can not be even addressed without direct reference to the quantum states .",
    "indeed , interference takes place every time when , with a given initial state , there are at least two alternative histories of evolution to a given final state .",
    "the wave function is nothing but a transition amplitude between the two states .",
    "hbt interferometry studies the two - particle wave functions ( or , more precisely , the two - particle density matrix ) .",
    "therefore , the most natural way to avoid any ambiguity is to pose the whole problem as a problem of a quantum transition . )",
    "@xcite , where this approach was first used for photon interferometry of the qgp . there , the photon emission was due to the processes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and the identical gluons or quarks of the final state would interfere as well , if they had not become the constituents of the thermalized system . ]",
    "equations ( [ eq : e2.6 ] ) and ( [ eq : e2.7 ] ) are universal in a sense that the standard observables of interferometry are expressed in terms of their heisenberg operators . in order to make them useful",
    ", we have to specify both the evolution operator @xmath30 and the initial data embodied in the density matrix @xmath46 . in other words , the theory that claims to have any predictive power must incorporate physical information about the freezeout dynamics .",
    "two models which reflect our current vision of the heavy - ion scenario , are explored in the next two sections .",
    "the simplest and the most nave model of freezeout has been explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to have a reference point for the discussion of the more involved situation detailed in the next section , we review this model below with new updated emphases .",
    "in fact , this model is not dynamical .",
    "no microscopic mechanism of free pion production is specified .",
    "we just declare the pion field to become free after some time ( or , in a more intelligent way , starting from some space - like surface @xmath47 ) .",
    "this is what is done technically , but certain assumptions must be kept in mind .",
    "first , up to the freezeout surface @xmath47 , the system is assumed to be a continuous medium which obeys relativistic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath47 corresponds to some critical temperature @xmath48 at which all interactions that maintained the local thermal equilibrium in the expanding medium are switched off .",
    "consequently , we assume the pion distribution over the momenta ( not in phase space ! ) at this moment to be ( almost ) thermal .",
    "it is incorporated into the initial data for the future free propagation .",
    "second , the correlation length along @xmath47 is finite and much less than the total size of the system which is a dynamical consequence of the interactions before the freezeout . in order to incorporate this property into the nave picture of the instantaneous freezeout",
    ", we must consider the whole system as a collection of boxes ( fluid elements ) filled by free particles which are opened when their world lines reach @xmath47 .",
    "third , even though we may wish to disregard the quantum nature of the pions in the fluid expansion phase , we have to account for it when we pose the problem of interferometry .",
    "in other words , the pions have to be produced in certain _ states_. this ( perhaps , most important ) goal is also achieved if we mimic freezeout by the model of the opening boxes .      in order to avoid any misunderstanding ,",
    "we remind the reader that the quantum - mechanical measurement of some observable , by definition , includes the procedure of averaging over an ensemble .",
    "a single element of this ensemble carries no quantum - mechanical information . following ref.@xcite",
    ", we can argue that the inclusive measurement explores all quantum mechanical fluctuations which can dynamically develop before the moment of measurement and are consistent with the detector response . from this point of view , nothing but a causal chain of real interactions can affect the detector response , and only dynamical histories can interfere .",
    "there is a significant difference between the cases when one- , two- , or three - particle inclusive distributions are measured .",
    "each of these measurements is unique in a sense that they are all _ mutually exclusive _ even if they are obtained from the same ensemble of multiparticle events .",
    "for example , if the three - pion distribution is measured ( i.e. , the average over an ensemble is accomplished ) , then the integration over the momentum of the third pion does not result in the two - pion inclusive distribution  @xcite .",
    "this example reflects a qualitative difference between classical and quantum distributions .",
    "the former are defined immediately in terms of _ probabilities _ while the later are defined via _ transition amplitudes _ with the probabilities playing the secondary role .",
    "the same conclusions follow from the field - theory formalism we employ .",
    "the interference emerges as a strict consequence of the commutation relations ( [ eq : e3.7 ] ) which incorporate a distinctive property of the hydrodynamic model to localize the freezeout point for each pion independently .",
    "we start from the quantum operator ( [ eq : e2.8 ] ) of the measured observable and trace the two - pion signal back to its origin .",
    "eventually , we arrive at the square of the symmetrized two - pion amplitude , once again , regardless of the total number @xmath73of pions in a particular event .",
    "the states with many pions are completely accounted for in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e2.5 ] ) and ( [ eq : e2.7 ] ) and , consequently , in ( [ eq : e3.8 ] ) and ( [ eq : e3.10 ] ) . however , they can contribute to the one- and two - pion observables only via real interactions which are absent in our oversimplified model of a nave freezeout . a more realistic example with the interaction is considered in the next section .    in eq.([eq : e3.10 ] ) , we seemingly encounter a problem .",
    "if , e.g. , the first of the integrals is considered as the delta - function which sets momenta @xmath75 and @xmath76 equal , then the value of the second one is not obvious .",
    "it occurs that the second integral over the volume @xmath55 becomes @xmath77 to prove this , we need more physical information . the interferometry would have been impossible if we could have traced each pion back to the coordinate of its emission or , in other words , if we could have built an `` optical image '' of the source . according to the rayleigh criterion , the latter is possible only if @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , we may observe interference only provided the last inequality does not hold .",
    "thus we have @xmath79 , which proves ( [ eq : e3.11 ] ) .    in the continuous limit , by introducing an auxiliary `` emission function '' @xmath80 , @xmath81 the expressions for the one- and two - particle inclusive spectra can be rewritten in a form which is convenient for numerical computations : @xmath82 and @xmath83~ ~ ~ ,",
    "\\label{eq : e3.16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , these equations were used to study interferometry for several types of one  dimensional flow . here",
    ", we are interested only in the case of the boost - invariant geometry which must be very close to the reality of rhic .",
    "indeed , any scenario initiated with a strong lorentz contraction ( up to 0.1  fm ! ) of the nuclei can not possess a scale associated with the initial state .",
    "hence , both at classical and quantum levels , the system must evolve with the preserved boost - invariance . in terms of the hydrodynamic theory of multiple production @xcite ,",
    "the absence of scale in initial data of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations immediately leads to the bjorken self - similar solution @xcite as the only possible solution .",
    "recent analysis of quantum fluctuations at the earliest stage of heavy - ion collisions @xcite indicates the same .",
    "the overlap of lorentz - contracted nuclei converts them into a system of modes of _ expanding plasma _ with the global boost - invariant geometry .",
    "this is a single quantum transition and it is not compatible with the picture of gradually developing parton cascade @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis of two - pion correlations , in the picture of `` nave freezeout , '' from the phase of expanding hot pion gas was done in refs .",
    "one of the predictions of these studies , the so - called @xmath84-scaling of the pion and kaon correlators , was confirmed by the data of the na35 and na44 collaborations @xcite obtained from au - au collisions at sps energies ( @xmath8510  gev / nucleon ) .",
    "these data carry two important messages .",
    "first , even when the nuclei are lorentz - contracted only up to the size of 1  fm , this is almost enough to bring about the boost invariant regime of collective flow .",
    "there is no doubts that this picture will be even more pronounced at rhic .",
    "the second , less trivial consequence of the observed @xmath84-scaling is that _ the freezeout is sharp _ ; if the creation of the final - state pions were extended in ( local ) time , the @xmath84-scaling would vanish @xcite .",
    "thus , addressing the pion production at rhic , we have every reason to rely on two facts : ( i ) the hadronic matter before the freezeout forms a collective system , and ( ii ) this system is in the state of the self - similar boost - invariant expansion .    for the immediate goals of this study ,",
    "an advantage of the intensive longitudinal flow is that it provides a window in the phase - space of the two pions where the effect of the hidden interference ( explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : sn1 ] , and computed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : sn4 ] ) is most visible .",
    "this window corresponds to the measurement of the transverse size of the longitudinally - expanding pipe using pairs of pions with the same rapidity . in this way",
    ", we employ a distinctive feature of the hydrodynamic - type sources to localize the emission spectrum . the required localization in rapidity",
    "is achieved by choosing pions with large transverse momenta ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this has a very simple physical explanation .",
    "if the emitting system is kinetically equilibrated ( or even sufficiently chaotized ) then the mean energy per particle is limited from above . thus , in the rest - frame of a fluid element , the particles with large transverse momenta can have , on average , only small longitudinal momenta . in other words , such particles",
    "are effectively frozen into the collective hydrodynamic motion in the laboratory frame .- scaling and the qualitative basis for the saddle - point calculations below . ] measuring there longitudinal rapidity after freezeout , we are most likely to measure the longitudinal rapidity of the fluid at the emission site .",
    "two remarks are in order :    \\1 .",
    "the shape of the correlator given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e3.21 ] ) and ( [ eq : e3.22 ] ) is manifestly non - gaussian .",
    "thus , it is plausible to get rid of the intermediate gaussian fit and to use these equations to fit the data as the first step .",
    "\\2 . a main deficiency of the correlator ( [ eq : e3.21 ] )",
    "is that the possible transverse expansion has not been taken into account .",
    "this is not easy to do since the initial data in the transverse plane are , as yet , poorly understood and the amount of matter involved in the collective transverse motion at the freezeout stage may vary depending on the initial conditions , equation of state , etc .",
    "we consider this issue still open .",
    "since the goal of this paper is to demonstrate a physical effect , we shall limit ourselves , in what follows , with the @xmath130 interaction term . in this case , we are able to do most calculations analytically , which is necessary in order to understand the interplay of the many parameters .",
    "more involved calculations will require a realistic description of the @xmath115-scattering and monte - carlo computation of multiple integrals .",

    "our last remark is about the possibility of the induced emission of pions . to address this question",

    "if we deal with the measured states , then the symmetrization is solely due to the measurement .",

    "this is the basic idea behind the laser .",
    "if the pions are produced with space - like separation , then stimulated emission is impossible .",

    "a complexity stemming from an additional interference makes simulations more challenging .",
    "we address this issue below .    over the last decade , many computer codes which are supposed to mimic the particle yields in heavy - ion collisions have been developed .",
    "these codes rely on classical propagation of the particles in hadronic cascades .",
    "they do not describe the quantum properties of the measurement which lead to the interference of amplitudes .",
    "at best , the output of an event generator is the list of particles with one - to - one correspondence between their momenta and the coordinates of their emission .",
    "such a list is equivalent to a complete optical image of the source .",
    "therefore , there are no alternative histories in the free propagation .",
    "an `` afterburner '' has to be added to incorporate quantum effects .    in order to recover the alternative histories and thus simulate the two - pion correlations in a model with independent pion production",

    "they are necessary to recover the two - pion amplitude @xmath211 ( see eq .",

    "the requirement that the quantum mechanics of the last interaction , which forms the two - pion spectrum , must be recovered , follows from first principles and can not be removed . in some particular cases , one may take a short cut and weaken the requirements of the complete description .",
    "however , every precaution should be taken that the initial state of the interfering system is described as a _",
    "quantum state_.    finally , we have to mention that in the literature , another kind of correlation function , which has been introduced @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) in connection with the problem of simulation of bose - einstein correlations in multi - pion events , is widely discussed .",
    "the algorithmic definition of this object ( which is different from the inclusive differential distribution used in this paper ) has several steps : ( i ) the events are sorted by the total number @xmath73 of pions in the event .",

    "i.e. , the @xmath73-pion amplitude is fully symmetrized and its squared modulus is averaged over the subset of events with this given @xmath73 .",
    "( iii ) all but two arguments of @xmath212 are integrated out , which results in a set of two - pion correlators @xmath213 , still dependent on @xmath73 .",
    "( iv ) this set is averaged over @xmath73 , in order to obtain @xmath214 .",
    "we could not find a quantum observable which would correspond to this correlator .",
    "we also could not establish a direct connection between this correlator and the parameters of the emitting system .",
    "in this paper , we show that precise measurements of two - particle correlators , both for identical and non - identical particles , may uncover important information about the freezeout dynamics . a reliable theoretical prediction for the magnitude of these correlations",
    "can be made only within the framework of an elaborated scenario of the heavy - ion collision which is currently absent .",
    "data may be very helpful for the theoretical design of the fully self - consistent scenario .",
    "it is equally important to measure the magnitude of the effect of hidden interference or to establish its absence at a high level of confidence . from this point of view ,",
    "our calculations carry an important message that there are no theorems which require the normalized two - pion correlator to approach unity for large differences of momenta .",
    "neither should it take the value of 2 at @xmath3 .",
    "the latter value is the norm ( charge ) of the state with two identical pions in a _",

    "two final - state pions are described by a density matrix . for the same reason , the normalized correlator of non - identical pions should not equal 1 . moreover , the correlator should not equal 1 even for the couples like @xmath0 , @xmath1 , etc .",
