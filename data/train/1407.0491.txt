    "read - once branching programs ( robps ) is a well known representation of boolean functions .",
    "oblivious robps , better known as ordered binary decision diagrams ( obdds ) , is a subclass of robps , very well known because of its applications in the area of verification @xcite .",
    "an important procedure in these applications is transformation of a cnf into an equivalent obdd .",
    "the resulting obdd can be exponentially larger than the initial cnf , however a space efficient transformation is possible for special classes of functions .",
    "for example , it has been shown in @xcite that a cnf of treewidth @xmath0 of its primal graph can be transformed into an obdd of size @xmath3 .",
    "a natural question is if the upper bound can be made fixed - parameter i.e. of the form @xmath4 for some constant @xmath2 . in @xcite we showed that it is impossible by demonstrating that for each sufficiently large @xmath0 there is an infinite class of cnfs of treewidth at most @xmath0 whose smallest obdd is of size at least @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we report a follow up result showing that essentially the same lower bound holds for non - deterministic robps ( nrobps ) .",
    "in particular we show that there is a constant @xmath6 such that for each sufficiently large @xmath0 there is an infinite class of cnfs of treewidth at most @xmath0 ( of their primary graphs ) for which the space complexity of the equivalent nrobps is at least @xmath1 .",
    "note that nrobps are strictly more powerful than robps in the sense that there is an infinite class of functions having a poly - size nrobp representation and exponential robp space complexity @xcite . in the same sense ,",
    "robps are strictly more powerful than obdds , hence the result proposed in this paper is a significant enhancement of the result of @xcite .",
    "we believe this result is interesting from the parameterized complexity theory perspective because it contributes to the understanding of parameterized _ space _ complexity of various representations of boolean functions .",
    "in particular , the proposed result implies that robps are inherently incapable to efficiently represent functions that are representable by cnfs of bounded treewidth .",
    "a natural question for further research is the space complexity of read @xmath2-times branching programs @xcite ( for an arbitrary constant @xmath2 independent on @xmath0 ) w.r.t . the same class of functions .",
    "to prove the proposed result , we use monotone @xmath7-cnfs ( their clauses are of form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath7 distinct variables ) .",
    "these cnfs are in one - to - one correspondence with graphs having no isolated vertices : variables correspond to vertices and @xmath7 variables occur in the same clause if and only if the corresponding vertices are adjacent .",
    "this correspondence allows us to use these cnfs and graphs interchangeably .",
    "we introduce the notion of distant matching width ( dmw ) of a graph @xmath11 and prove @xmath7 theorems .",
    "one of them states that a nrobp equivalent to a monotone 2-cnf with the corresponding graph @xmath11 having dmw at least @xmath12 is of size at least @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant dependent on the max - degree of @xmath11 .",
    "the second theorem states that for each sufficiently large @xmath0 there is an infinite family of graphs of treewidth @xmath0 and max - degree @xmath15 whose dmw is at least @xmath16 for some constant @xmath17 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the main theorem immediately follows from replacement of @xmath12 in the former lower bound by the latter one .",
    "the strategy outlined above is similar to that we used in @xcite .",
    "however , there are two essential differences .",
    "first , due to a much more ` elusive ' nature of norbps compared to that of obdd , the counting argument is more sophisticated and more restrictive : it applies only to cnfs whose graphs are of constant degree . due to this latter aspect , the target set of cnf instances requires a more delicate construction and reasoning .    due to the space constraints ,",
    "some proofs are either omitted or replaced by sketches .",
    "the complete proofs are provided in the appendix .",
    "in this paper by a _ set of literals _ we mean one that does not contain an occurrence of a variable and its negation . for a set @xmath18 of literals",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the set of variables whose literals occur in @xmath18 . if @xmath20 is a boolean function or its representation by a specified structure , we denote by @xmath21 the set of variables of @xmath20 . a truth assignment to @xmath21",
    "on which @xmath20 is true is called a _ satisfying assignment _ of @xmath20 .",
    "a set @xmath18 of literals represents the truth assignment to @xmath19 where variables occurring positively in @xmath18 ( i.e. whose literals in @xmath18 are positive ) are assigned with @xmath22 and the variables occurring negatively are assigned with @xmath23 .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 a function whose set of satisfying assignments consists of @xmath25 such that @xmath26 is a satisfying assignment of @xmath20 .",
    "we call @xmath24 a _ subfunction _ of @xmath20 .",
    "we define a non - deterministic read once branching program ( nrobp ) as a connected acyclic read - once _ switching - and - rectifier network _ @xcite .",
    "that is , a nrobp @xmath27 implementing ( realizing ) a function @xmath20 is a directed acyclic graph ( with possible multiple edges ) with one leaf , one root , and with some edges labelled by literals of the variables of @xmath20 in a way that there is no directed path having two edges labelled with literals of the same variable .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 the set of literals labeling edges of a directed path @xmath29 of @xmath27 .",
    "the connection between @xmath27 and @xmath20 is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath29 be a path from the root to the leaf of @xmath27 .",

    "it is not hard to see that the traditional definition of nrobp as a deterministic robp with guessing nodes @xcite can be thought as a special case of our definition ( for any function that is not constant @xmath23 ) : remove from the former all the nodes from which the @xmath22 leaf is not reachable and relabel each edge with the appropriate literal of the variable labelling its tail ( if the original label on the edge is @xmath32 then the literal is positive , otherwise , if the original label is @xmath33 , the literal is negative ) .",
    "we say that a nrobp @xmath27 is _ uniform _ if the following is true .",
    "let @xmath14 be a node of @xmath27 and let @xmath34 and @xmath35 be @xmath7 paths from the root of @xmath27 to @xmath14",
    ". then @xmath36 .",
    "that is , these paths are labelled by literals of the same set of variables . also , if @xmath29 is a path from the root to the leaf of @xmath27 then @xmath37 .",
    "thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between the sets of literals labelling paths from the root to the leaf of @xmath27 and the satisfying assignments of @xmath20 .    *",
    "all the nrobps considered in sections 3 - 5 of this paper are uniform .",
    "* this assumption does not affect our main result because an arbitrary nrobp can be transformed into a uniform one at the price of @xmath38 times increase of the number of edges .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we provide the transformation and its correctness proof in the appendix .",
    "we use the construction described in the proof sketch of proposition 2.1 of @xcite .    for our counting argument we need a special case of nrobp where _ all _ the edges are labelled",
    ", each node is of out - degree at most @xmath7 and @xmath7 out - edges of a node of degree exactly @xmath7 are labelled with opposite literals of the same variable .",
    "we call this representation _ normalized free binary decision diagram _ ( nfbdd ) .",
    "we need additional terminology regarding nfbdd .",
    "we say that each non - leaf node @xmath14 is _ labelled _ by the variable whose literals label its out - edges and denote this variable by @xmath39 .",
    "further on , we refer to the out - going edges of @xmath14 labeled by , respectively , positive and negative literals of @xmath39 as _ positive _ and _ negative _ out - going edges of @xmath14 .",
    "the heads of these edges are respective _ positive _ and _ negative _ out - neighbours of @xmath14 ( if both edges have the same head then these out - neighbours coincide ) .",
    "note that given a labelling on nodes , there will be no loss of information if all the positive edges are labelled with @xmath32 and all the negative edges are labelled with @xmath33 : the information about the labelling variable can be read from the tail of each edge and hence only the information about the sign of the labelling literal is needed .",
    "it follows that , for instance an obdd with all the nodes from which the @xmath40-leaf can not be reached being removed is , in essence , an nfbdd .",
