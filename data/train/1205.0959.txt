    "cryptography is certainly one of the most advanced applications of quantum technologies . within this field ,",
    "the most studied primitive is quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , which is the art of distributing a secret key to two distant parties , alice and bob , in an untrusted environment controlled by an adversary , eve @xcite .",
    "the security of qkd lies on the idea that an adversary trying to acquire some information about the secret key will necessarily introduce some noise in the quantum communication between alice and bob .",
    "a consequence of this idea is that if the quantum channel is too lossy or noisy , then it can not be used to distill a secret key .",
    "this limits the maximum transmission distance between the legitimate parties .",
    "developing qkd protocols resistant to losses and noise is therefore of great practical importance .    among qkd protocols ,",
    "those encoding information in the amplitude and phase of coherent states @xcite have the advantage of only requiring off - the - shelf telecom components , as well as being compatible with wavelength - division multiplexing @xcite , making an interesting solution for robust implementations @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "these continuous - variable ( cv ) protocols have been proven secure against arbitrary attacks provided that they are secure against collective attacks @xcite .",
    "this latter condition is in particular met for all cv protocols without postselection for which gaussian attacks are known to be optimal within collective attacks @xcite .",
    "protocols with postselection on the other hand @xcite , where alice and bob only use part of their data to extract a secret key , can increase the robustness of qkd to losses and noise but at the price of more involved security proofs .",
    "in particular , their security is only established against gaussian attacks @xcite , or when an active symmetrization of the classical data is applied @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the use of a noiseless linear amplifier ( nla ) @xcite on the detection stage as a way to increase the robustness of cv qkd protocols against losses and noise .",
    "first , it should be noted that while amplifiers can effectively recover classical signals , they only offer limited advantages when working on quantum signals , as amplification is bound to preserve the original signal to noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite .",
    "this implies that ordinary linear amplifiers , as those realized by optical parametric processes @xcite , can only find limited applications in the context of qkd @xcite .    on the other hand , a _",
    "nla can in principle amplify the amplitude of a coherent state while retaining the initial level of noise @xcite .",
    "thus , when only considering its successful runs , the nla can compensate the effect of losses and could therefore be useful for quantum communication @xcite , and to establish the nonlocal nature of quantum correlations thanks to a loophole - free bell test @xcite .",
    "the availability of such a device has stimulated intense experimental activity over the past years , demonstrating the implementation of approximated versions @xcite , which have provided solid proof - of - principle .",
    "the question arises if these more sophisticated devices can deliver a compensation of losses with a success rate such that it may represent a useful tool for quantum cryptography . here",
    "we address this problem , by investigating the advantages and limitations of the most general nla device , without making assumptions on the particular realization .",
    "we find a regime in which the nla leads to an improvement of the maximum transmission distance attainable on a noisy and lossy gaussian channel . because of the non - deterministic nature of the nla , the security proofs considered here are similar to those concerning protocols with postselection , that is , they hold against gaussian attacks , or collective attacks provided an additional symmetrization of the classical data is performed .",
    "we consider explicitly the case for the most common protocol for continuous - variable qkd , designed by grosshans and grangier ( gg02 ) @xcite . in",
    "its prepare - and - measure ( pm ) version , alice encodes information in the quadratures of coherent states which are then sent to bob through the untrusted quantum channel .",
    "alice chooses her preparation @xmath2 from a gaussian distribution for the two quadratures having zero mean and variance @xmath3 .",
    "bob randomly decides whether to measure the @xmath4 or the @xmath5 quadrature , using homodyne detection .",
    "alice and bob finally extract a secret key from the correlated data by performing classical data manipulation and authenticated classical communication .",
    "this protocol offers a simple experimental implementation @xcite and is secure against finite - size collective attacks @xcite as well as arbitrary attacks in the asymptotic limit of arbitrary long keys @xcite .",
    "this protocol can be reformulated in an entanglement - based version ( eb ) , in terms of entanglement distribution between alice and bob @xcite : the two parties initially share a two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "alice performs an measurement on her mode , which projects the other mode on a coherent state .",
    "the outcome of alice s measurement is random , but with a probability distribution depending on @xmath8 .",
    "although the eb version does not correspond to the actual implementation , it is fully equivalent to the pm version from a security point of view , and it provides a more powerful description for establishing security proofs against collective attacks through the covariance matrix @xmath9 of the state shared by alice and bob before their respective measurements . in the case of a gaussian channel with transmittance @xmath10 , and input equivalent excess noise @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the variance of the thermal state @xmath16 related to the modulation variance by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the input equivalent noise due to losses .",
    "this matrix contains all the information needed to establish the secret key rate for collective attacks @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mutual information shared by alice and bob given by shannon s theory @xcite , and @xmath21 is the holevo bound for the mutual information shared by eve and bob ( see appendix [ appendixholevo ] ) . the reconciliation efficiency @xmath22 accounts for the fact that in practical implementations of this protocol , alice and bob do not have sufficient resources to reach the shannon limit .",
    "steady progress has been made in recent years on the problem of error correction for cv qkd @xcite and today procedures based on modern error correcting techniques achieve @xmath23 for a large range of snr @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the use of a nla in the gg02 protocol . as usual , we will perform the security analysis of the eb version . here , we restrict ourselves to the case of a gaussian quantum channel , that is eve",
    "is limited to performing gaussian attacks . since the secure key rate of the protocol depends only on the covariance matrix of alice and bob @xmath9 , it is sufficient to compute it in presence of the nla .    in this modified version of the protocol , alice and",
    "bob implement gg02 as usual but bob adds a nla to his detection stage , before his homodyne detection , which is here assumed to be perfect . then , only the events corresponding to a successful amplification will be used to extract a secret key .",
    "this scheme is therefore very similar to protocols with postselection .",
    "since the output of the nla remains in the gaussian regime , we can look for equivalent parameters of an epr state sent through a gaussian noisy channel .",
    "their derivation is explained in detail in appendix [ appendixeffectiveparameters ] , where it is shown that the covariance matrix @xmath24 of the amplified state is equal to the covariance matrix @xmath25 of an equivalent system with an epr parameter @xmath26 , sent through a channel of transmittance @xmath27 and excess noise @xmath28 , without using the nla .",
    "those effective parameters are given by : @xmath29     sent through a gaussian channel of transmittance @xmath10 and excess noise @xmath11 , followed by a successful amplification , has the same alice - bob covariance matrix than a state @xmath30 sent through a gaussian channel of transmittance @xmath27 and excess noise @xmath28 , without the nla . ]",
    "this identification easily provides the secret information @xmath31 corresponding to the successful amplification , since eq .",
    "[ secretkey ] can be used with the effective parameters : @xmath32    those parameters can be interpreted as physical parameters of an equivalent system if they satisfy the physical meaning constraints @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath8 is a global factor in the expression of @xmath26 , the first condition is always satisfied if @xmath8 is below a limit value : @xmath36 as @xmath27 and @xmath28 do not depend on @xmath8 , the parameter @xmath26 can be considered as independent of those two parameters , keeping in mind that this simply sets the value of @xmath8 .",
    "the second and the third conditions are satisfied if the excess noise is smaller than 2 , and if the gain is smaller than a maximum value given by eq .",
    "[ gainmax ] , and plotted on fig .",
    "[ gmax ] .     against the losses in db .",
    "the analysis of the equivalent state allows us to compare the secret key rate obtained with and without an ideal nla .",
    "the comparison must be performed for a given channel with fixed losses @xmath10 and excess noise @xmath11 , as those parameters can not be controlled by alice or bob . however , since the relevant quantity is the maximum secret key rate achievable over this channel , alice is allowed to optimize her modulation variance @xmath3 ( or equivalently , the parameter @xmath8 ) in order to maximize the secret key rate .",
    "the secret key rate without the nla is given by @xmath38 ( eq . [ secretkey ] ) .",
    "the secret key rate with the nla @xmath39 is obtained by multiplying the secret key rate for successful amplifications @xmath40 by the probability of success @xmath41 .",
    "if the nla has a sufficient dynamics to neglect distortions , we can assume that @xmath41 is constant .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption if @xmath22 , since in that case the optimal value of @xmath3 is not infinite . the precise value of @xmath41 will depend on practical implementations , and is not important is our study , since it only acts as a scaling factor and does not change the fact that a negative secret key rate can become positive with a nla .",
    "therefore , @xmath42    in appendix [ appendixproba ] , we show that the probability of success for a nla of gain @xmath0 is upper bounded by @xmath43 .",
    "we can therefore use this bound , keeping in mind that the relevant conclusion which can be taken is only whether the secret key rate is positive or not . both secret key rate with and without the nla",
    "are computed using the formulae given in appendix [ appendixholevo ] .",
    "since the expression of @xmath44 is relatively difficult to manipulate , we perform a series expansion at the first order in @xmath10 , which corresponds to the strong losses regime ( appendix [ appendixdlholevo ] ) .",
    "the approximate secret key rate is given by eq .",
    "[ dlholevo ] .",
    "its expression gives us an intuition about two important behaviors : first , since @xmath10 appears inside the expansion and not only as a global factor , it explains why there can be a maximum transmission distance , or equivalently a value @xmath45 for which the secret key rate becomes null .",
    "second , in this regime , the effect of the nla is simply to replace the transmittance @xmath10 by @xmath46 , the other physical parameters being the same .",
    "hence , it is clear that the losses are reduced , which will increase the maximum distance of transmission .",
    "let us prove those statements more precisely . from eq .",
    "[ dlholevo ] , we find an analytical value of @xmath45 when @xmath47 ( _ i.e _ without the nla ) , @xmath48 this expression clearly tends to 0 when @xmath11 tends to 0 , which shows that there is no maximum transmission distance without excess noise .",
    "interestingly , there is a maximum transmission distance as soon as the excess noise @xmath11 is non zero , even if the reconciliation efficiency @xmath49 equals 1 .",
    "when @xmath49 decreases or when @xmath11 increases , this maximum transmission distance decreases .",
    "there is no limitation of the distance of transmission only when @xmath50 , and in that case eq .",
    "[ dlholevo ] takes a simple form : @xmath51 this shows that for strong losses without excess noise , the secret key rate using the nla with the most optimistic probability of success is the same as the secret key rate without the nla , and is always positive if @xmath8 is optimized .",
    "@xmath45 can also be optimized ( _ i.e. _ minimized ) by optimizing @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , the optimal value @xmath52 depends only on @xmath49 , as shown by eq .",
    "[ betaopt ] .",
    "the same calculation with a nla of gain @xmath0 shows that : @xmath53 therefore , the losses for which the secret key rate is zero are increased by : @xmath54    let us stress that this result does not depend on the probability of success of the nla , which simply acts as a scaling factor for the secret key rate .",
    "hence , even for a more realistic probability of success , the nla increases the maximum distance of transmission in the same way .",
    "those results are compared with numerical results for the full expressions of @xmath44 and @xmath39 , on fig .",
    "[ schemaebpm3 ] and [ contourplot ] . for both figures ,",
    "the secret key rate is computed without the nla and with a nla of gain @xmath55 ( which is in the allowed region of fig .",
    "[ gmax ] ) .     for the series expansion , and on @xmath26 for the the numerical expression .",
    "the numerical curves are in excellent agreement with the analytical expansions .",
    "as explained in the main text , the secret key rate with the nla is very optimistic due to the probability of success @xmath43 , and hence its curve gives only information on its positivity .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xcite . ]     for the series expansion , and on @xmath26 for the numerical expression . for low losses , we see that the first order expansion is not enough , whereas it is in excellent agreement with the numerical curve for strong losses .",
    "the reconciliation efficiency is @xmath57 @xcite . ]",
    "those figures clearly show that the secret key rate stays positive for losses increased by @xmath58 db .",
    "[ contourplot ] also shows that for given losses , the secret key rate stays positive for a higher value of excess noise .",
    "however , the gain in excess noise depends on the losses , and does not have a simple analytical expression .",
    "another important remark concerns the optimal gain .",
    "if the transmission can be intuitively increased by increasing the gain , this is not always the case for the secret key rate , as shown on fig .",
    "[ keyratevsgain ] .",
    "the first reason is the competition between the decreasing probability of success @xmath43 and the potential increase of the secret key rate for the successfully amplified states .",
    "the second reason is due to the dependance on the gain of the effective parameters ( eq . [ parametreseffectifsmain ] ) : the higher the gain , the higher @xmath27 , but also the higher @xmath28 .",
    "if the gain is too high , it is thus possible that the effective excess noise @xmath28 would be too important , for the transmittance @xmath27 , to give a positive @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 , losses@xmath6130 db . with a gain @xmath47 ,",
    "the secret key rate is negative .",
    "the nla can increase the secret key rate to positive values when the gain is increased up to a certain value , however if the gain is too important the secret key rate decreases and becomes negative again .",
    "the reason is that the effective excess noise becomes too important for the effective transmittance.,width=302 ]",
    "in presence of excess noise , the secret key rate of the gg02 protocol against gaussian collective attacks always becomes negative for a certain distance of transmission .",
    "we have shown that the noiseless linear amplifier can increase this distance by the equivalent of @xmath62 db of losses .",
    "we have also shown that for given losses , the protocol is more robust against excess noise .",
    "our calculation of the secret key rate with the amplifier was based on an effective system for which the security proofs are well established .",
    "this approach could also find applications in other quantum communication protocols involving an epr state sent through a quantum channel , followed by a noiseless amplifier .",
    "in particular , it could be applied to other cv qkd protocols , for instance protocols using squeezed states or with a heterodyne detection @xcite    a further work would be to consider the experimentally demonstrated schemes of the nla , which are only valid approximations of the ideal nla up to a certain number of photons .",
    "if the state can be well approximated by this truncation , so that the gaussian approximation still holds , the results presented in this paper are still valid . on the other hand ,",
    "if the gaussian approximation does not hold anymore , security proofs are more complicated to manipulate .",
    "this problem lies beyond the scope of the present work , and deserves further investigation .",
