    "the temperature induced phase transition in the n - component scalar field theory ( o(n)-model ) has been investigated by many authors .",
    "the interest to this problem results , in particular , from the importance of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and symmetry restoration at finite temperature in various modern field theoretical models of elementary particles including different content of scalar fields .",
    "the present status of this problem is characterized by a general opinion that the phase transition in the o(n)-models ( including n=1 ) is of second order ( see , for instance , the standard text books @xcite . )",
    "this conclusion results mainly from the non perturbative methods - lattice simulations , average action ( flow equation ) methods , large - n expansion @xcite . in opposite ,",
    "a first order phase transition was found in the most perturbative approaches @xcite . here , the key problem - the necessity of resummation of the infrared divergences of a series in the coupling constant - has been overcome by applying the super daisy resummation .",
    "however , after that another problem - the lack of the smallness of the effective expansion parameter near the phase transition - remains .",
    "this observation prevents conclusive results from the resummed perturbation theory and it leaves room for the expectation that a further resummation of the perturbation expansion is able to weaken the first order character of the expansion making it a second order at the end . in recent papers @xcite by an auxiliary - mass method it was found that the phase transition in either the @xmath2- or the @xmath3-model is of second order .",
    "moreover , it was also stated in ref .",
    "@xcite that in perturbation theory at the two - loop level the phase transition is also of second order when diagrams beyond the super daisy type are taken into account . because of the importance of these results we shall discuss them in more detail in what follows",
    "here , we note that the effective potential calculated by this method has an imaginary part in its minimum which means an inconsistency of the calculation procedure adopted .    in our previous paper @xcite within the @xmath2-model we developed as a new method the combination of the gap equation resulting from the second legendre transform with the condition of the free energy considered as a function of the condensate to be in an extremum .",
    "this allows for the exclusion of the condensate value from the gap equation and results in considerable simplifications .",
    "for instance , in the super daisy approximation we obtained very simple explicit formulas showing clearly a first order phase transition .",
    "we applied our method to a certain class of graphs beyond this approximation and obtained an increase of the first order character of the transition .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize our method to the @xmath3-model . again , in the extrema of the free energy , we exclude the condensate from the gap equations which form a set of two equations for the higgs and goldstone field masses .",
    "we consider in detail both , the super daisy resummation and the next class of graphs beyond .",
    "we find that the phase transition is of first order for any finite @xmath0 turning into a second order one in the limit of @xmath0 goes to infinity . at the same time",
    ", the observed phase transition is very close to a second order one and differs from it in the next - to - leading order in @xmath1 for finite but large @xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by calculating a certain class of graphs beyond the super daisy approximation in the @xmath3-model , namely those which correspond to the next - to - next - to - leading order for large @xmath0 . here",
    "we are left with a mostly numerical approach to the gap equations confirming the qualitative stability of our previous results . the diagram mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite is also included in the carried out resummations .",
    "its influence is discussed in the last section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we collect the basic formulas of the resummation method based on the second legendre transform together with our method to consider the gap equations in the extrema of the free energy . in the third section we consider the case corresponding to the super daisy approximation . in the fourth section the summation of the bubble chain diagrams",
    "is carried out .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "some technical material is banned into the appendix .",
    "we consider a scalar @xmath0-component field theory in @xmath4 dimensions in the euclidean space - time .",
    "the action reads [ action ] s[]&=&x ( 12 ( x)*k*(x)-((x))^4 ) , where @xmath5 is the kernel of the free action .",
    "the sign is chosen so that the vacuum green functions are given by the functional representation [ z ] ze^w = d  e^s , where @xmath6 is the functional of the connected green functions .",
    "it is connected by the relation [ w ] w =- ft with the free energy @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the theory at finite temperature @xmath8 in the matsubara formalism so that the loop integrations are given by [ tr ] tr_p = t_l=-^ with the momentum @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath11 is here a condensed notation for @xmath0 scalar fields , @xmath12 . in the action eq .",
    "the following summation over the internal indices is assumed : @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the present paper , we perform a standard renormalization procedure at zero temperature .    the second legendre transform is introduced as follows .",
    "consider as an arbitrary functional argument the full propagator @xmath15 , instead of being the free one [ freeprop]=-k^-1 , then the functional @xmath6 is a functional depending on @xmath15 : @xmath16 $ ] . here and in the following",
    "we denote a functional dependence by squared brackets in opposite to the dependence of a function on its argument .",
    "so , for example , in momentum representation , @xmath15 is a function of the momentum @xmath17 : @xmath18 , whereas @xmath16 $ ] is not , of course . in this sense",
    "the action eq .",
    "is also a functional of @xmath11 : @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "now , the second legendre transform results in the representation [ wallg ] w = s[0]+12 tr -12 tr ^-1 + w_2 [ ] of the connected green functions , where @xmath15 is subjected to the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation [ sdallg ] ^-1(p)=^-1-(p ) . here ,",
    "@xmath20(p)$ ] is the functional of all self energy graphs with no propagator insertions , [ sigallg ] ( p)=2 w_2(p ) , where @xmath21 is the functional derivative , see , e.g. , @xcite for details .",

    "the above formulas are written in condensed notations .",
    "so , they are valid for any theory with any number of fields .",
    "below , we will write down them explicitly in the @xmath3-model .",
    "but before doing that we introduce the spontaneous symmetry breaking by turning the sign of the mass term in the free propagator , @xmath23 in @xmath24 so that it reads now @xmath25 in the momentum representation . then , on the tree level , the minimum of the energy is on the shifted fields , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the field condensate .",
    "after that we change the notations according to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the higgs field and @xmath30 are the goldstone fields which are symmetric under the residual @xmath31 symmetry .    in terms of the new variables the action reads [ sef ] s[,]&= & dx \\",

    "again , the summation over the internal indices is assumed . in momentum representation ,",
    "the corresponding free propagators are [ freep ] _ = p^2+_^2 _ = p^2+_^2 .",

    "the sd - equations form a set of @xmath0 equations which are equivalent to one equation due to the symmetry . in the considered case of the broken symmetry ,",
    "two equations remain : [ sd2 ] ^-1_(p)&=&^-1_-_(p ) , + ^-1_(p)&=&^-1_- _ ( p ) , where following the self energy functionals are given by [ sigon ] _ ( p)&=&2 , + _ ( p)&= & . here , the simple relation @xmath38 was taken into account .    at sufficiently high temperature",
    "the symmetry is restored .",
    "this means that the value of the condensate is zero , @xmath39 , and the masses of the higgs and the goldstone fields are equal , @xmath40 .",
    "then the sd - equations reduce to one equation , eq . .",
    "at low temperature , the symmetry is broken and @xmath27 is non zero .",
    "the masses are different and we have to consider two equations , eqs . .",
    "then , the free energy is the function of the condensate @xmath27 .",
    "it has a minimum at @xmath41 which can be seen already on the tree level .",
    "it may have more extrema . in that case due to the continuity of the free energy as a function of @xmath27 an additional extremum for @xmath41",

    "but they vanish by means of the sd - equations . in eq . , @xmath45 denotes the derivative with respect to the explicit dependence on @xmath27 entering through the vertex factors .",
    "demanding now the derivative given by eq . to vanish , [ nulll]=0",
    ", we obtain the following equation , [ v ] v^2=m^2 - 3 _",
    "-_+2 , which has to be considered together with the sd - equations .",
    "in order to proceed it is necessary to make approximations .",
    "first of all , we put the momentum @xmath17 in the sd - equations equal to zero , @xmath46 , that is , we turn to the corresponding gap equations .",
    "this is reasonable because we are interested in the infrared behavior and the gap in the spectrum is the decisive quantity .",
    "so we make the ansatz [ betam ] _ & = & p^2+m_^2 + _ & = & p^2+m_^2 for the propagators and consider the sd equations at @xmath46 . the assumption connected with this approximation is that the behavior of the propagator is mostly the same for the full solution and for , that the behavior for mediate momenta is not essential and that the important information is contained in the gap , i.e. , in @xmath47 and in @xmath48 .",
    "we note that in the super daisy approximation the corresponding contribution to @xmath49 is independent of @xmath17 and the approximation becomes an exact relation .",
    "the next approximation concerns the functional @xmath50 . here , we restrict ourselves to graphs with at most two insertions of the trilinear vertex . in analytic notation",
    "we have [ w2app0 ] w_2 [ _ , _ ] & = & w_2^sd+d+v^2+o(v^4 ) . contributions proportional to @xmath51 and higher powers of @xmath42",
    "are dropped .",
    "furthermore , we wrote down explicitely the lowest graphs , i.e. , the graphs with one vertex , and introduced the notation @xmath52 for the remaining ones . by construction , the graphs in @xmath52 do not contain @xmath27-dependent vertices and have at least two vertices .",

    "we rewrite the first gap equation , eq .",
    ", in the form [ ge2a]m_^2= 2(1- ) ( m^2-_^(0 ) -_^(0 ) + 2 ) , where we took the relation @xmath57 into account .",
    "then , by means of eq . , we rewrite eq . as [ mv]v^2= ( 1- ) ^-1 . the second gap equation can be rewritten in a similar way .",
    "first we insert @xmath27 from eq . in its first appearance and from eq . in its second one .",
    "we obtain finally [ ge2b ] m_^2= ( _ ^(0 ) -_^(0 ) ) - + 2(- ) . in this way",
    "all necessary general formulas are collected . in the next sections",
    "we will proceed with more specific approximations .",
    "the super daisy approximation ( sometimes the corresponding diagrams are called also cactus or foam diagrams ) is the result of summing up all graphs containing lines closed up over one vertex .",
    "it is known that this resummation is equivalent to take in the functional @xmath50 , eq . ,",
    "the contribution of @xmath53 , , only .",
    "so , we have to put in the formulas given in the preceding section @xmath58 .",

    "now we insert @xmath70 from into the first equation in formula , [ gesdbi ] m_^2&= & 2m^2 -+ 2m_+m_(m _ ) .",
    "this equation can be written down as a fourth order algebraic equation . but",
    "for a moment let us rewrite it formally by solving as a quadratic equation for @xmath47 keeping @xmath70 , [ 2eqf ] m_=. for @xmath72 we have a solution for the upper sign which is clearly the mass in the minimum of the free energy .",
    "hence the solution with the lower sign describes a maximum .",
    "this mass vanishes for @xmath73 ( taking into account eqs . and ) .",

    "it can be easily plotted and is shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "we have chosen @xmath74 in order to make the details near the phase transition better visible .",
    "but we can obtain the basic properties of this solution in the follwing way .",

    "we observe that for small @xmath8 there is one solution . at @xmath73",
    "a second solution appears and at some temperature @xmath75 both solutions merge and disappear .",
    "so @xmath75 has to be interpreted as the upper spinodal temperature . in this way",
    "we observe a first order phase transition .",
    "once we have an algebraic solution of the gap equations , we can give an algebraic expression for @xmath75 .",
