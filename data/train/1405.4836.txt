    "a basic problem in differential geometry is to find `` best '' or `` canonical '' metrics on smooth manifolds .",
    "the most famous example is the classical uniformization theorem , which says that every closed 2-dimensional manifold admits a metric with constant curvature , and moreover this metric is essentially unique in its conformal class .",
    "calabi s introduction of extremal khler metrics  @xcite is an attempt at finding a higher dimensional generalization of this result , in the setting of khler geometry .",
    "there are of course other ways in which one could attempt to generalize the uniformization theorem to higher dimensional manifolds .",
    "one possibility is the yamabe problem in the context of conformal geometry .",
    "this says  @xcite that on a closed manifold of arbitrary dimension , every conformal class admits a metric of constant scalar curvature .",
    "moreover this metric is often , but not always , unique up to scaling . a different generalization to 3-dimensional manifolds is given by thurston s geometrization conjecture , established by perelman  @xcite . in this case",
    "the goal is to find metrics of constant curvature on a 3-manifold , but this is too ambitious .",
    "instead it turns out that every 3-manifold can be decomposed into pieces each of which admits one of 8 model geometries .",
    "the search for extremal khler metrics can be thought of as a complex analogue of the yamabe problem , where we try to find canonical representatives of a given khler class , rather than a conformal class . in both cases",
    "the effect of restricting the space of metrics that we allow results in the problems reducing to scalar equations involving the conformal factor , and the khler potential , respectively .",
    "we will see , however , that in contrast with the yamabe problem extremal metrics do not always exist , and in these cases one can hope to find a canonical `` decomposition '' of the manifold into pieces somewhat reminiscent of the geometrization of 3-manifolds .    in order to define extremal metrics , let @xmath0 be a compact complex manifold of dimension @xmath1 , equipped with a khler class @xmath2 .",
    "denote by @xmath3 the set of khler metrics in the class @xmath4 .",
    "an extremal metric is a critical point of the calabi functional @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scalar curvature of @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the average of @xmath6 with respect to the volume form @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath8 is independent of the choice of @xmath10 .",
    "calabi  @xcite has shown that @xmath7 is an extremal metric if and only if the gradient @xmath11 is a holomorphic vector field .",
    "since most complex manifolds do not admit any non - trivial holomorphic vector fields , most extremal metrics are constant scalar curvature khler ( csck ) metrics .",
    "a particularly important special case is when the first chern class @xmath12 is proportional to the khler class @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a csck metric , then it follows that @xmath15 and so @xmath7 is a khler - einstein metric .",
    "it is known that any two extremal metrics in a fixed khler class are isometric ( see chen - tian  @xcite ) , which makes extremal metrics good candidates for being canonical metrics on khler manifolds . on the other hand ,",
    "not every khler class admits an extremal metric , the first examples going back to levine  @xcite of manifolds which do not admit extremal metrics in any khler class .",
    "the basic problems are therefore to understand which khler classes admit extremal metrics , and what we can say when no extremal metric exists .",
    "the most interesting case of the existence question is when @xmath16 is the first chern class of a line bundle , and consequently @xmath0 is a projective manifold . in this case",
    "the yau - tian - donaldson conjecture predicts that the existence of an extremal metric is related to the stability of the pair @xmath17 in the sense of geometric invariant theory . in section",
    "[ sec : kstab ] we will discuss two such notions of stability : k - stability , and a slight refinement of it which we call @xmath18-stability .    as a consequence of work of tian  @xcite , donaldson  @xcite , mabuchi  @xcite , stoppa  @xcite , stoppa - szkelyhidi  @xcite , paul  @xcite , berman  @xcite , and others ,",
    "there are now many satisfactory results that show that the existence of an extremal metric implies various notions of stability . the converse direction , however , is largely open . in section",
    "[ sec : existence ] we will discuss two results in this direction .",
    "one is the recent breakthrough of chen - donaldson - sun  @xcite on khler - einstein metrics with positive curvature , and the other is work of the author on extremal metrics on blowups .    finally in section",
    "[ sec : noextremal ] we turn to what is to be expected when no extremal metric exists , i.e. when a pair @xmath17 is unstable .",
    "it is still a natural problem to try minimizing the calabi functional in a khler class , and we will discuss a conjecture due to donaldson relating this to finding the optimal way to destabilize @xmath17",
    ". we will give an example where this can be interpreted as the canonical decomposition of the manifold alluded to above .",
    "over the years i have benefited from conversations about extremal metrics with many people .",
    "in particular i would like to thank simon donaldson , duong phong , julius ross , jacopo stoppa , richard thomas and valentino tosatti for many useful discussions .",
    "the work presented in this survey was partially supported by the nsf .",
    "it is a conjecture going back to yau ( see e.g. @xcite ) that if @xmath0 is a fano manifold , i.e. the anticanonical line bundle @xmath19 is ample , then @xmath0 admits a khler - einstein metric if and only if @xmath0 is stable in the sense of geometric invariant theory .",
    "tian  @xcite introduced the notion of k - stability as a precise candidate of such a stability condition and showed that it is necessary for the existence of a khler - einstein metric .",
    "donaldson  @xcite generalized the conjecture to pairs @xmath17 where @xmath20 is an ample line bundle , not necessarily equal to the anticanonical bundle .",
    "more precisely , donaldson formulated a more algebraic version of k - stability , and conjectured that k - stability of the pair @xmath17 is equivalent to the existence of a csck metric in the class @xmath21 .",
    "we start by giving a definition of donaldson s version of k - stability .",
    "a _ test - configuration _ for @xmath17 of exponent @xmath22 is a @xmath23-equivariant , flat , polarized family @xmath24 over @xmath25 , with generic fiber isomorphic to @xmath26 .",
    "the central fiber @xmath27 of a test - configuration has an induced @xmath23-action , and we write @xmath28 for the infinitesimal generator of this action on @xmath29 . in other words , the eigenvalues of @xmath28 are the weights of the action .",
    "there are expansions @xmath30    given a test - configuration @xmath31 of exponent @xmath22 for @xmath17 as above , its futaki invariant is defined to be @xmath32 the norm of @xmath31 is defined by @xmath33 where the factor involving @xmath22 is used to make the norm unchanged if we replace @xmath34 by a power .    with these preliminaries , we can give a definition of k - stability .",
    "[ defn : kstab ] the pair @xmath17 is k - stable if @xmath35 for all test - configurations @xmath31 with @xmath36 .    the condition @xmath37 is required to rule out certain `` trivial '' test - configurations .",
    "an alternative definition by li - xu  @xcite requires @xmath38 to be a normal variety distinct from the product @xmath39 , but the condition using the norm @xmath40 will be more natural below , when discussing filtrations .",
    "the central conjecture in the field is the following .",
    "[ conj : ytd ] suppose that @xmath0 has no non - zero holomorphic vector fields .",
    "then @xmath0 admits a csck metric in @xmath21 if and only of @xmath17 is k - stable .    when @xmath0 admits holomorphic vector fields which can be lifted to @xmath34 , then it is never k - stable according to the previous definition , since in that case one can find test - configurations with total space @xmath41 , with a non - trivial @xmath23-action whose futaki invariant is non - positive . in this case",
    "a variant of k - stability , called k - polystability , is used , which rules out such `` product test - configurations '' and is conjecturally equivalent to the existence of a csck metric , even when @xmath0 admits holomorphic vector fields . a further variant of k - stability , called relative k - stability , was defined by the author  @xcite , and it is conjecturally related to the existence of extremal metrics . in relative k - stability",
    "one only considers test - configurations which are orthogonal to a maximal torus of automorphisms of @xmath0 in a suitable sense .",
    "let @xmath42 .",
    "the family of conics @xmath43 for @xmath44 gives a test - configuration @xmath31 for @xmath17 of exponent 2 , degenerating a smooth conic into the union of two lines ( see figure  [ fig : tc ] ) .",
    "a small computation gives @xmath45 .",
    "it is not surprising that this is positive , since the fubini - study metric on @xmath46 has constant scalar curvature .",

    "indeed they construct examples where the existence of an extremal metric is equivalent to the positivity of a certain function @xmath49 on an interval @xmath50 , while relative k - stability only ensures that @xmath49 is positive at rational points @xmath51 .",
    "it is thus natural to try to work with a completion of the space of test - configurations in a suitable sense in order to detect when this function @xmath49 vanishes at an irrational point .",
    "this motivates the the author s work  @xcite on filtrations .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the homogeneous coordinate ring of @xmath17 .",

    "if @xmath56 , and @xmath57 has degree @xmath58 piece @xmath59 , then @xmath60 .",
    "3 .   @xmath61 .",
    "witt nystrm  @xcite showed that every test - configuration for @xmath17 gives rise to a filtration .",
    "in fact the rees algebra of the filtration is the coordinate ring of the total space of the test - configuration . on the other hand given any filtration @xmath31 of the homogeneous coordinate ring of @xmath17",
    ", we obtain a flag of subspaces @xmath62 of the degree @xmath22 piece @xmath63 for all @xmath64 . in turn , such a flag gives rise to a test - configuration of exponent @xmath22 for @xmath17  by embedding @xmath0 into projective space using a basis of @xmath65 , and acting by a @xmath23-action whose weight filtration is given by our flag .",
    "therefore any filtration @xmath31 induces a sequence of test - configurations @xmath66 , where @xmath66 has exponent @xmath22 .",
    "it is natural to think of @xmath31 as the limit of the @xmath66 , and thus to define @xmath67 where the limit can be shown to exist .",
    "the main difference between filtrations arising from test - configurations , and general filtrations , is that the rees algebras of the latter need not be finitely generated .    in terms of filtrations",
    "we define the following stability notion , which is stronger than k - stability .",
    "the pair @xmath17 is @xmath18-stable , if @xmath35 for all filtrations of the homogeneous coordinate ring of @xmath17 satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "in view of the examples of apostolov - et .",
    "al . that we mentioned above",
    ", it may be that in the yau - tian - donaldson conjecture one should assume @xmath18-stability instead of k - stability .",
    "one direction of this modified conjecture has been established by boucksom and the author  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : khatstable ] suppose that @xmath0 has no non - zero holomorphic vector fields .",
    "if @xmath0 admits a csck metric in @xmath21 , then @xmath68 is @xmath18-stable .",
    "the analogous result for k - stability was shown in stoppa  @xcite , building on work of donaldson  @xcite which we will see in theorem  [ thm : callower ] , and arezzo - pacard  @xcite which we will discuss in section  [ sec : existence ] . in the proof of theorem  [ thm : khatstable ]",
    "the main additional ingredient is the use of the okounkov body  @xcite .",
    "note that when @xmath69 , then related results were shown by tian  @xcite and paul - tian  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that a result analogous to theorem  [ thm : khatstable ] can be shown for extremal metrics along the lines of @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss two special cases , where the yau - tian - donaldson conjecture has been verified .",
    "we first focus on khler - einstein metrics , i.e. when @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath70 , or @xmath71 , then the celebrated work of yau  @xcite implies that @xmath0 admits a khler - einstein metric , and a stability condition does not need to be assumed ( see also aubin  @xcite for the case when @xmath72 ) .    in the remaining case , when @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath0 is fano , it was known from early on ( see e.g. matsushima  @xcite ) that a khler - einstein metric does not always exist , and yau conjectured that the existence is related to stability of @xmath0 in the sense of geometric invariant theory .",
    "tian  @xcite found all two - dimensional @xmath0 which admit a khler - einstein metric , and in @xcite he formulated the notion of k - stability , which he conjectured to be equivalent to the existence of a khler - einstein metric .",
    "the main difference between tian s notion of k - stability and the one in definition  [ defn : kstab ] is that tian s version of k - stability only requires @xmath74 for very special types of test - configurations with only mild singularities . in particular",
    "their futaki invariants can be computed differential geometrically using the formula futaki  @xcite originally used to define his invariant . by the work of li - xu",
    "@xcite it turns out that in the fano case tian s notion of k - stability is equivalent to the a priori stronger condition of definition  [ defn : kstab ] .",
    "recently , chen - donaldson - sun  @xcite have proved conjecture  [ conj : ytd ] for fano manifolds :    suppose that @xmath0 is a fano manifolds and @xmath75 is k - polystable .",
    "then @xmath0 admits a khler - einstein metric .    to construct a khler - einstein metric ,",
    "the continuity method is used , with a family of equations of the form @xmath76,\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is a smooth divisor in the linear system @xmath78 , and @xmath79 $ ] denotes the current of integration .",
    "more precisely , a metric @xmath80 is a solution of @xmath81 if @xmath82 on @xmath83 , while @xmath80 has conical singularities along @xmath77 with cone angle @xmath84 .",
    "one then shows that equation  [ eq : conecont ] can be solved for @xmath85 for some @xmath86 ( see donaldson  @xcite for the openness statement ) , and the question is what happens when @xmath87 .",
    "one of the main results of the work of chen - donaldson - sun is , roughly speaking , that along a subsequence the manifolds @xmath88 have a gromov - hausdorff limit @xmath89 which is a @xmath90-fano variety , such that the divisor @xmath91 converges to a weil divisor @xmath92 , and @xmath89 admits a weak khler - einstein metric with conical singularities along @xmath92 ( defined in an appropriate sense )",
    ". moreover , there are embeddings @xmath93 and @xmath94 into a sufficiently large projective space , such that the pairs @xmath95 converge to @xmath96 in an algebro - geometric sense . in this case",
    "either @xmath96 is in the @xmath97-orbit of the @xmath95 in which case we can solve equation   for @xmath98 , or otherwise we can find a test - configuration for @xmath99 with central fiber @xmath100 to show that @xmath101 is not k - stable .",
    "note that here one needs to extend the theory described in section  [ sec : kstab ] to pairs @xmath99 resulting in the notion of log k - stability  @xcite .",
    "the fact that a sequence of solutions to equation   has a gromov - hausdorff limit which is a @xmath90-fano variety originates in work of tian  @xcite on the 2-dimensional case , and it is essentially equivalent to what tian calls the `` partial @xmath102-estimate '' being satisfied by such a sequence of solutions .",
    "this partial @xmath102-estimate was first shown in dimensions greater than 2 by donaldson - sun  @xcite for sequences of khler - einstein metrics , and their method has since been generalized to many other settings : chen - donaldson - sun  @xcite to solutions of ; phong - song - sturm  @xcite for sequences of khler - ricci solitons ; tian - zhang  @xcite along the khler - ricci flow in dimensions at most 3 ; the author  @xcite along aubin s continuity method ; jiang  @xcite using only a lower bound for the ricci curvature , in dimensions at most 3 .",
    "note that tian s original conjecture on the partial @xmath102-estimate is still open in dimensions greater than 3  namely we do not yet understand gromov - hausdorff limits of fano manifolds under the assumption of only a positive lower bound on the ricci curvature .    to close this subsection",
    "we mention a possible further result along the lines of chen - donaldson - sun s work .",
    "as we described above , if @xmath0 does not admit a khler - einstein metric , then a sequence of solutions to equation   will converge to a weak conical khler - einstein metric on a pair @xmath103 as @xmath87 .",
    "suppose @xmath104 .",
    "we can think of this metric as a suitable weak solution to the equation @xmath105\\ ] ] for @xmath98 on the space @xmath89 . since the pair @xmath103 necessarily has a non - trivial automorphism group",
    ", we can not expect to solve this equation for @xmath106 , however it is reasonable to expect that we can still find weak conical khler - ricci solitons , i.e. we can solve @xmath107,\\ ] ] for some range of values @xmath106 , with suitable vector fields @xmath108 fixing @xmath92 .",
    "an extension of chen - donaldson - sun s work to khler - ricci solitons , generalizing phong - song - sturm  @xcite , could then be used to extract a limit @xmath109 as @xmath110 , with yet another ( weak ) conical khler - ricci soliton , and so on .",
    "based on this heuristic argument we make the following conjecture .",
    "we can solve equation   up to @xmath111 by passing through finitely many singular times , changing the pair @xmath103 each time .",
    "at @xmath111 we obtain a @xmath90-fano variety @xmath112 admitting a weak khler - ricci soliton .",
    "moreover , there is a test - configuration for @xmath101 with central fiber @xmath112 .",
    "a further natural expectation would be that the khler - ricci soliton obtained in this way is related to the limiting behavior of the khler - ricci flow on @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , according to the hamilton - tian conjecture ( see tian  @xcite ) , the khler - ricci flow is expected to converge to a khler - ricci soliton with mild singularities .",
    "beyond the khler - einstein case there are very few general existence results for csck or extremal metrics .",
    "one example is the case of toric surfaces , where conjecture  [ conj : ytd ] has been established by donaldson  @xcite , with an extension to extremal metrics by chen - li - sheng  @xcite . in this section",
    "we will discuss a perturbative existence result for csck metrics on blow - ups .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is a csck metric on a compact khler manifold @xmath0 , and choose a point @xmath113 .",
    "for all sufficiently small @xmath114 the class @xmath115 - \\epsilon^2 [ e]\\ ] ] is a khler class on the blowup @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the blowdown map , and @xmath118 $ ] denotes the poincar dual of the exceptional divisor . a basic question , going back to work of lebrun - singer  @xcite , is whether @xmath116 admits a csck ( or extremal ) metric in the class @xmath119 for sufficiently small @xmath120 .",

    "one way to overcome this issue is to try to solve a more general equation of the form @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a khler metric and @xmath158 . the operator @xmath49 is constructed so that if @xmath159 and @xmath160 is in the stabilizer of @xmath132 , then @xmath157 is an extremal metric , which has constant scalar curvature if @xmath161 .",
    "at the same time the linearization of @xmath49 is surjective .",
    "one can then show that for sufficiently small @xmath120 , for every point @xmath135 we can find a solution @xmath162 of the corresponding equation .",
    "the search for csck metrics is then reduced to the finite dimensional problem of finding zeros of the map @xmath163 since if @xmath164 , then we have found a csck metric on @xmath116 in the class @xmath119 .",
    "more generally to find extremal metrics we need to find @xmath132 such that @xmath165 .",
    "at this point it becomes important to understand better what the map @xmath166 is , and for this one needs to construct better approximate solutions than our crude attempt @xmath128 above . in turn",
    "this requires more precise expansions of the metrics @xmath125 and @xmath7 than what we had in equations and . for the burns - simanca metric ,",
    "according to gauduchon  @xcite we have @xmath167,\\ ] ] where @xmath168 , while for the metric @xmath7 we have @xmath169,\\ ] ] where @xmath170 and @xmath171 are quartic and quintic expressions .",
    "essentially @xmath170 is the curvature of @xmath7 at @xmath132 , while @xmath171 is its covariant derivative at @xmath132 .",
    "the way to obtain better approximate solutions than @xmath128 is to preserve more terms in these expansions rather than multiplying them all with cutoff functions . in practice",
    "this involves modifying the metric @xmath7 on the punctured manifold @xmath172 and @xmath125 on @xmath127 to incorporate new terms in their khler potentials that are asymptotic to @xmath173 and @xmath174 respectively .",
    "the upshot is that we can obtain an expansion for @xmath166 which is roughly of the form @xmath175 for some @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the moment map for the action of @xmath153 on @xmath0 , and @xmath178 is its laplacian . at this point",
    "one can exploit the special structure of moment maps to show that if @xmath179 is in the stabilizer @xmath180 , and @xmath120 is sufficiently small , then there is a point @xmath181 in the orbit of @xmath132 under the complexified group such that @xmath182 .",
    "since @xmath116 is biholomorphic to @xmath139 in this case , we end up with an extremal metric on @xmath122 . under the k - polystability assumption this extremal metric",
    "is easily seen to have constant scalar curvature .    finally ,",
    "if @xmath183 for any @xmath181 and sufficiently small @xmath120 , then the kempf - ness principle  @xcite relating moment maps to git stability can be exploited to find a @xmath23-action on @xmath0 which induces a destabilizing test - configuration for @xmath116 .",
    "there are several interesting problems which we hope to address in future work .    1",
    ".   one should extend theorem  [ thm : stabblowup ] to the case when @xmath140 and to general extremal metric . in principle",
    "both of these extensions should follow from a more refined expansion of the function @xmath166 than what we have in equation  , but it may be more practical to find a different , more direct approach .",
    "2 .   can one obtain similar existence results for blow - ups along higher dimensional submanifolds ?",
    "if @xmath0 is an arbitrary compact khler manifold , is it possible to construct a csck metric on the blowup of @xmath0 in a sufficiently large number of points ?",
    "this would be analogous to taubes s result  @xcite on the existence of anti - self - dual metrics on the blowup of a 4-manifold in sufficiently many points .",
    "see tipler  @xcite for a related result for toric surfaces , where iterated blowups are also allowed .",
    "even if @xmath0 does not admit an extremal metric in a class @xmath21 , it is natural to try minimizing the calabi functional . that this is closely related to the algebraic geometry of @xmath17",
    "is suggested by the following result , analogous to a theorem due to atiyah - bott  @xcite in the case of vector bundles .",
    "[ thm : callower ] given a polarized manifold @xmath17 , we have @xmath184 where the supremum runs over all test - configurations for @xmath17 with @xmath36 , and @xmath185 is an explicit dimensional constant",
    ".    donaldson also conjectured that in fact equality holds in .",
    "when @xmath0 admits an extremal metric @xmath186 , then it is easy to check that @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the product configuration built from the @xmath23-action induced by @xmath189 . in other words equality",
    "holds in in this case .",
    "when @xmath17 admits no extremal metric , there is little known , except for the case of a ruled surface  @xcite where we were able to perform explicit constructions of metrics and test - configurations to realize equality in .",
    "note that in the case of vector bundles the analogous conjecture is known to hold ( i.e. equality in ) by atiyah - bott  @xcite over riemann surfaces , and jacob  @xcite in higher dimensions .    to describe our result ,",
    "let @xmath190 be a genus 2 curve , and @xmath191 , where @xmath192 denotes any degree one line bundle over @xmath190 .",
    "for any real number @xmath193 , we have a khler class @xmath194 on @xmath0 , defined by @xmath195 + m[s_0],\\ ] ] where @xmath196 , [ s_0]$ ] denote poincar duals to the homology classes of a fiber @xmath49 and the zero section @xmath197 .",
    "up to scaling we obtain all khler classes on @xmath0 in this way .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath198 , in @xcite we observed 3 qualitatively different behaviors of a minimizing sequence for the calabi functional in @xmath194 .",
    "there are explicitly computable numbers @xmath199 and minimizing sequences @xmath200 for the calabi functional in @xmath194 with the following properties :    1 .",
