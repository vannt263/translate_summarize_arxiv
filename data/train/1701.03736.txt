    "there are several factors which could explain this anomalously high [ cii]/co(21 ) line ratio , including the metallicity , age , and degree of fractionation of the molecular clouds in 3c368 .",
    "moving toward the core of a molecular cloud from its surface , a transition is made from c@xmath35 to co as carbon - ionizing and co - dissociating photons are extincted by dust .",

    "if the dust - to - gas ratio follows metallicity , then it follows that the penetration depth of these carbon - ionizing photons can be very large in a low - metallicity ism , making the co core relatively small compared to the c@xmath35 envelope , and leading to large [ cii]/co ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the co emitting core of a molecular cloud retreats as the metallicity decreases , the size of the molecular region , defined by the transition from h to h@xmath77 , does not .",
    "this transition from h to h@xmath77 is set by the self shielding of h@xmath77 molecules , and is therefore metallicity independent .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the low metallicity case is unlikely for 3c368 , which has a stellar mass of @xmath2 3.6@xmath510@xmath6@xmath7 @xcite . at the current star formation rate",
    ", it would take @xmath2 10@xmath78years to accumulate such a stellar population . assuming that each star formation episode lasts @xmath2 10@xmath64 @xmath10 10@xmath79years , 3c368 would have been through @xmath2 10 @xmath10 100cycles of star formation , making a low metallicity ism seem improbable .",
    "additionally , 3c368 lies on the  galaxy main sequence \" for a source at redshift 1.131 ( using the definition of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , furthering the idea that a low metallicity ism is not responsible for the lack of co in this case .    a different scenario which could be used to explain the lack of co is that the ism in 3c368 may be highly fractionated into small cloudlets .",
    "such a fractioned ism would have modest extinction to the core of individual cloudlets , allowing for considerable c@xmath35 emission with relatively little co emission .",
    "since the upper limit from our co observations show that the line is suppressed from the expected value by more than 12@xmath5 , the co emitting cores of the molecular clouds in 3c368 must correspondingly be more than @xmath80@xmath5 smaller in radius than the entire clouds . taking a@xmath66 @xmath2 3 , or a corresponding column density of 6@xmath510@xmath81cm@xmath19 , as the co depth , and our fitted pdr density of @xmath2 7,500@xmath29",

    "yet another possible explanation for the lack of co in 3c368 is that the molecular clouds in the galaxy may be chemically young . @xcite",
    "have shown that c@xmath35 recombines with free electrons to form c@xmath83 in less than @xmath2 0.1myrs , while the subsequent formation of co from the neutral atoms can take significantly longer , @xmath2 1@xmath103myrs",
    ". it could be that we are observing these molecular clouds before they have had the chance to form an appreciable amount of co.    the work of @xcite suggests that a chemically young ism may be possible here .",
    "cloudlets within a clumpy ism , moving relative to one other , can periodically shield each other from the intense uv radiation field present in the ism . in this scenario ,",
    "the [ cii ] which we observe would originate from the surfaces of dense cloudlets exposed to the intense uv field .",
    "the co emitting cores of the cloudlets would retreat toward the center each time they were exposed to the full uv field , and then take an appreciable time to reform after the next shielding event .",
    "this effect would be particularly pronounced if the cloudlets were small , and hence much of their volume was penetrated by uv photons between shielding events , as seems to be the case here .",
    "a testable prediction of this model would be the existence of considerable [ ci ] emission , since c@xmath35 recombines quickly after the shielding event is initiated .",
    "for this reason , we plan to do follow up observations of 3c368 in [ ci ] , in order to try and resolve the mystery of the missing co.",
    "in an effort to answer some of the remaining questions pertaining to 3c368 , we have been awarded alma time to observe the [ cii ] 158@xmath0 line , at 0@xmath152 spatial resolution , to determine the extent of star formation in this source .",
    "the models which we have employed here predict star formation extended over kilo - parsec scales , which , if correct , will appear in the alma observations as an extended source over @xmath210beams .",
    "in addition to the ionized carbon line , we have also been awarded time to observe the [ ci ] 609@xmath0 line in 3c368 ( the 370@xmath0 line is blocked by the atmosphere ) .",
    "we expect that if the molecular clouds in the galaxy are indeed chemically young , the neutral carbon line will be very bright when compared to our co line upper limit , since the co would not have had sufficient time to form .",
    "we have observed the fine - structure lines constituting the  oxygen toolkit \" in 3c368 , including the [ oi ] 63@xmath0 , [ oiii ] 52@xmath0 and 88@xmath0 , and [ oiv ] 26@xmath0 lines . using these oxygen lines together with archival fine - structure neon lines in the mid - infrared ,",
    "we have modeled the h ii regions in 3c368 , using the models of @xcite , and found them to be ionized by starbursts headed by o8 stars , with an age of @xmath2 6.5myr .",
    "this age is comparable to the estimated age of the latest episode of agn activity in 3c368 , determined by the propagation of the radio lobes .",
    "given the rate of star formation that we are witnessing in 3c368 , with the alignment of the optical and radio axes , and estimated age of both the starburst and most recent epoch of agn activity , this source is a strong candidate for further study in the field of galaxy - bh coevolution .",
    "we have also modeled the pdrs in 3c368 , and found them to be consistent with star formation spread over kilo - parsec distance scales .",
    "however , we have not detected any co in 3c368 .",
    "our 3@xmath16 limit for the co(21 ) line is < 0.201jykms@xmath9 , or equivalently < 7.3@xmath510@xmath22wm@xmath19 , a level 12@xmath5 smaller than the value expected from standard pdr models .",
    "the lack of co emission may be due to a low - metallicity , highly fractionated , or possibly chemically young ism .",
    "we find that the most likely explanation is that the ism is highly fractionated into small clouds , perhaps as a result of the interactions between agn winds and the star forming molecular clouds , making it appear chemically young .",
