    "as supercooled liquids approach their glass transitions , one observes a very sharp increase in their viscosities and structural relaxation times .",
    "the physical mechanism underlying this slow dynamics remains controversial  @xcite .",
    "some theories , particularly the random first - order transition theory  @xcite , propose that glassy systems are approaching some kind of thermodynamic phase transition , with associated collective ( slow ) dynamics .",
    "the existence of such phase transitions can be probed by computing the free - energy of a pair of coupled copies ( or replicas ) of the system , and searching for a transition as a function of both temperature and coupling strength .",
    "these transitions link an equilibrium - like phase where the replicas are different from each other ( the liquid ) to one where they become very similar ( the glass )  @xcite .",
    "the similarity bewteen the configurations is measured by an overlap variable , which is the order parameter for the transition .",
    "an alternative approach , that of dynamical facilitation  @xcite , links glassy behaviour to a dynamical `` space - time '' phase transition .",
    "this transition is explored through distributions of time - integrated observables , which quantify activity in the dynamics  @xcite . based on these distributions ,",
    "one may infer the existence of transitions between an active dynamical phase ( the equilibrium liquid ) and an inactive phase ( the non - equilibrium glass ) .",
    "the order parameter for these transitions is the dynamical activity .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate plaquette spin models of glasses  @xcite , for which both overlap - fluctuations and dynamical activity - fluctuations can be analysed , by a combination of analytical and computational methods .",
    "we concentrate on two models , whose relaxation behaviour is similar to that of the facilitated east model  @xcite  their relaxation times increase faster than an arrhenius law at low temperatures , but the equilibrium relaxation time is finite at all positive temperatures , diverging only as @xmath2 .",
    "we present evidence that these models support _ both _ dynamic and thermodynamic phase transitions . in the thermodynamic case we consider a coupling between two _",
    "annealed _ replicas , and transitions _ occur only for non - zero ( positive ) values of the coupling_.    we argue that these results provide a connection between the ( apparently quite different ) ` thermodynamic ' and ` dynamic ' theories of the glass transition .",
    "this connection is built on the idea of metastability , which is intrinsically connected to glassy behaviour .",
    "the formation of a metastable state in a finite dimensional system requires that small perturbations in that state do not grow : the system prefers to relax back into the metastable state .",
    "this stability to small perturbations may be described in terms of an interfacial cost that acts to penalise local perturbations .",
    "different theories ascribe different origins to these interfacial costs , which might be either static or dynamic , depending on the system of interest , and the kinds of fluctuation being considered .",
    "however , the existence of these interfacial costs seems quite generic , and may be useful for rationalising different kinds of phase transition in these systems .",
    "the main results of this work are as follows .",
    "we analyse the triangular plaquette model ( tpm ) in two spatial dimensions  @xcite , and a three - dimensional variant of this model , which we refer to as the square pyramid model ( spym ) . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we show that two ( annealed ) coupled replicas of these systems can be mapped to a single replica in a magnetic field , and we derive some useful features of this single - replica system , which place constraints on the kind of phase transitions that can occur .",
    "some of these results were derived in previous work  @xcite , but our analysis contains several new insights . in section",
    "[ sec : numeric - field ] , we show numerical evidence that the tpm in a magnetic field supports a phase transition in the @xmath3-ising universality class .",
    "it then follows from the mappings in section  [ sec : theory ] that the coupled replicas of these systems also support a similar phase transition . in section  [ sec : s - ens - tpm ] , we show that the tpm also supports dynamical `` space - time '' phase transitions , similar to those in  @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : spym ] , we introduce the spym , and show evidence that it supports phase transitions in the coupled replica setting , and dynamical space - time phase transitions . finally in section  [ sec : discuss ] , we discuss the relationships between the thermodynamic and dynamical phase transitions that we have found , and we consider the consequences of these results for theories of the glass transition .",
    "we consider plaquette spin models defined in terms of classical ising spins on regular lattices , with energy functions of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 with @xmath6 indicating a lattice site ( @xmath7 ) , and where the interactions are in terms of products of spins @xmath8 around the _ plaquettes _ @xmath9 of the lattice .",
    "see  @xcite for a more general overview of the relevant properties of these systems . on a square lattice ,",
    "one labels each square plaquette with an index @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the set of four spins on the vertices of plaquette @xmath9 .",
    "this construction is easily generalised to higher dimensions : for a cubic lattice and cubic `` plaquettes '' , each term in the energy would involve eight spins .",
    "this motivates us to define plaquette variables @xmath11 .",
    "an interesting model in this class is the tpm  @xcite , where the lattice is triangular and the interactions are between triplets of spins in the corners of upward pointing triangles , @xmath12 our analysis rests on a correspondence between configurations of the spin variables @xmath13 and the plaquette variables @xmath14 .",
    "if we first consider rhombus - shaped systems whose linear size is an integer power of @xmath15 , with periodic boundaries , then there is a one - to - one mapping between spin configurations and plaquette configurations .",
    "( it is clear that every spin configuration corresponds to a unique plaquette configuration , but the existence of a spin configuration corresponding to _ every _ plaquette configuration is less trivial @xcite . ) for systems of different sizes or with different boundary conditions , the correspondence is not perfectly one - to - one , but these deviations turn out to be irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit . in section  [ sec : spym ] below , we will also discuss the spym , a three - dimensional model with the same one - to - one correspondence , on the body - centred cubic ( bcc ) lattice .    in cases where the one - to - one mapping holds",
    "exactly , the fully polarised state @xmath16 is the unique ground state of ( [ e ] ) . in terms of the plaquette variables ,",
    "the ground state is @xmath17 , and the elementary excitation is a `` defect '' , @xmath18 .",
    "two - body spin correlations vanish in these models  @xcite , although higher - order spin correlations are finite and allow access to a growing length scale at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "also , since there is a one - to - one mapping between spins and plaquettes , the thermodynamic properties of these models are those non - interacting binary plaquette variables @xcite , or a free gas of ` defective ' plaquettes ( with @xmath19 ) .    however ,",
    "while the thermodynamic properties of plaquette models are trivial , their ( single spin - flip ) dynamics is not .",
    "this effect arises because flipping a single spin @xmath13 changes the states of all of the plaquettes in which it participates .",
    "the plaquette dynamics is therefore `` kinetically constrained '' , possibly leading to complex glassy dynamics at low temperatures .",
    "this is what occurs for example in the tpm whose dynamical properties are similar to those of the east facilitated model @xcite , displaying `` parabolic '' super - arrhenius relaxation , dynamic heterogeneity , and other characteristic features of the glass transition @xcite .      to probe thermodynamic overlap fluctuations , we consider two coupled replicas of a plaquette model  @xcite .",
    "the energy function of the combined system is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the spin configurations in the replicas @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the overlap , @xmath25 measures how similar the two copies are , and the strength of their coupling given by its conjugate field @xmath26 .",
    "the coupling ( [ e2 ] ) is denoted _ annealed _ since both replicas are allowed to fluctuate on an equal footing .",
    "the case of _ quenched _ coupling , in contrast , involves one of the replicas being frozen in an equilibrium configuration . here",
    "we will only consider the case of annealed coupling which is easier to treat both analytically and numerically . hence the partition function for these two coupled replicas is @xmath27 where the sum runs over the configurations @xmath28 : that is , over all @xmath29 and all @xmath30 . here and in the following",
    ", we sometimes set @xmath31 where there is no ambiguity [ for example , the left hand side of ( [ z2 ] ) should strictly be @xmath32 but we suppress the dependence on @xmath33 , for simplicity ] .     and",

    "such phase transitions were investigated in  @xcite : the plaquette models considered there support a single critical point that occurs at some point @xmath70 on this line , with first - order phase coexistence occurring on the part of the line with @xmath71 .    from the above mapping",
    ", these transitions correspond to phase transitions in the coupled replica system : the first - order transition line separates a state with low overlap ( small @xmath72 ) from one with high overlap ( large @xmath72 ) . for the coupled replicas ,",
    "the self - dual line is @xmath73 this situation , where the self - dual line for the coupled - replica system contains a first - order transition region and a critical point , was proposed for the tpm in ref .",
    "we present numerical evidence for this situation in section  [ sec : numeric - field ] below .",
    "in this section , we explore some further consequences of the results derived thus far .",
    "first , we note that the relation ( [ wz2q2 ] ) means that for a coupled replica system at parameters @xmath74 , the probability of a particular configuration of the overlap variables @xmath75 is the same as the probability of finding the configuration @xmath48 for a single system in a field , with parameters @xmath76 . from a numerical perspective",
    ", the single system in a field is much simpler to simulate , and the result ( [ wz2q2 ] ) means that such a simulation provides direct access to all observables based on the overlap variables .",
    "( this result is much stronger than a mapping at the level of free energies . )",
    "second , for a geometical interpretation of the duality relation ( [ z2d2 ] ) , we refer to figure  [ fig - tpm - layer ] .",
    "the original coupled system can be thought of as a lattice consisting of two parallel layers , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the duality relation ( [ z2d2 ] ) may be interpreted as a mapping between two different two - layer systems , where the plaquette energy scale in one model determines the interlayer coupling in the other , and vice versa .",
    "[ fig - tpm - layer](b ) illustrates this situation , in which the interlayer ` bonds ' in the original system intersect the intralayer plaquettes in the dual system , and _ vice versa_.",
    "this geometrical way of seeing the duality easily generalises to other lattices and plaquette interactions .",
    "axis is a symmetry line , there is a critical point indicated by a circle , with a first - order ( phase coexistence ) line for large @xmath77 , indicated by a solid line .",
    "selected lines of constant @xmath77 are indicated by dotted lines .",
    "( b )  the corresponding situation for the tpm in a field . on the solid / dashed line ( [ self - dual - field ] )",
    ", the system has a discrete ( @xmath78 ) symmetry : a critical point and phase coexistence both occur on this line , as indicated .",
    "the dotted lines are obtained from ( [ eq : jh0 ] ) for three different values of @xmath79 , and correspond to the lines of constant @xmath77 in panel ( a ) . near the critical point , they indicate the direction of the most relevant renormalisation group flow . ]",
    "third , the duality relation for a plaquette model in a field can be used to analyse the behaviour of its free energy in the vicinity of a ( presumed ) critical point",
    ". given ( [ equ : dual ] ) , it is useful to define the `` singular part '' of the free energy of a plaquette model in a field @xmath80 we assume that a critical point exists somewhere on the self - dual line , and that this critical point is in the ising universality class , as is found generically  @xcite ( see also below ) . we can then consider a renormalisation group flow near the critical point , which will have two relevant directions in the @xmath81 plane .",
    "one of these relevant directions corresponds to the ferromagnetic coupling @xmath77 of an associated ising model ; the other to a magnetic field @xmath82 in the ising model .    for the plaquette model , the relation ( [ equ : dual ] )",
    "is associated with a symmetry that will be spontaneously broken at the phase transition .",
    "hence , the relevant direction that corresponds to the ising coupling must be the one that preserves the self - dual symmetry : this direction lies along the self - dual line .",
    "however , it will be useful in the following to also identify the direction that corresponds to the ising field @xmath82 . to accomplish this",
    ", we define a family of curves in the @xmath81 plane that correspond to lines of constant @xmath77 in the ising system .",
    "the family of curves is parameterised by the points @xmath83 where they cross the self - dual line .",
    "the curves are invariant under the duality transformation ( just as lines of constant @xmath77 are invariant under the ising symmetry transformation @xmath84 . )",
    "furthermore , the singular part of the free energy , calculated along each curve , is an even function of @xmath85 ( just as the ising free energy is even in @xmath82 , for constant @xmath77 ) .",
    "the relevant family of curves is given by the formula @xmath86 the dual of any point on a line @xmath87 is easily verified to be @xmath88 , which also satisfies ( [ eq : jh0 ] ) , confirming that the line is invariant .",
    "it then follows from ( [ equ : dual ] ) that @xmath89 is a symmetric function of @xmath85 .",
    "the resulting situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ising - tpm ] .",
    "the significance of the curves ( [ eq : jh0 ] ) is that they give the direction of the most relevant rg flow at the critical point .",
    "the most natural order parameter for the phase transition is then obtained by taking a derivative of the free energy along these lines , for which @xmath90 we therefore define the order parameter @xmath91 = m - 2n_d\\sinh j , \\label{m}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the magnetisation , and @xmath93=\\frac12 \\sum_\\mu ( 1-\\tau_\\mu)$ ] is the number of defective plaquettes .",
    "a key advantage of this order parameter is that only even cumulants of @xmath94 may show singular behaviour at phase transitions : the odd cumulants can be shown to depend only on derivatives of the non - singular @xmath95 term in the free energy .",
    "the use of this order parameter also accounts automatically for `` field - mixing ''  @xcite when analysing critical properties .",
    "we performed numerical simulations of the tpm in a field , to analyse its phase behaviour . working always on the self - dual line ( [ selfdual ] ) we use continuous time monte carlo simulations  @xcite to sample a reweighted boltzmann distribution @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a bias function .",
    "we measure the resulting distribution @xmath98 of the magnetisation , but we choose the function @xmath97 so that this sampled distribution does not include any deep minima ( free energy barriers )  @xcite .",
    "the ` true ' distribution @xmath99 associated with the unbiased model is then easily obtained as @xmath100 .",
    "figure  [ fig - tpm - field](a ) shows numerical evidence that for large @xmath66 ( and small @xmath54 ) , the self - dual line is associated with a first - order phase transition : see also ref .",
    "the figure shows the distribution @xmath101 of the magnetisation density @xmath102 , for three state points on the self - dual line . at large @xmath66",
    "the distribution is bimodal , characteristic of first - order coexistence . a typical configuration at these conditions is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , showing coexistence of low- and high-@xmath103 regions , separated by sharp interfaces , as expected for a first - order transition . based on smaller systems ,",
    "a previous study  @xcite speculated that phase separation would not occur for the tpm in a field , but our results show that this does indeed occur large enough systems are considered .",
    "given the mapping ( [ wz2q2 ] ) , fig .",
    "[ fig - tpm - field](b ) is also a representative configuration of the overlap between two coupled replicas , for suitable @xmath74 .     ising universality class for the tpm and the @xmath104 ising universality class for the spym . ]    as @xmath66 is decreased ( or equivalently , temperature and field are increased ) along the self - dual line , the bimodality in @xmath99 becomes less pronounced and eventually disappears .",
    "[ fig - tpm - field](a ) indicates that the first - order line terminates at a critical point @xmath70 with @xmath105 . to identify the universality class of this phase transition , we performed a finite - size scaling analysis , using the order parameter @xmath94 defined in ( [ m ] ) .",
    "note that if all spins are up , one has @xmath106 and @xmath107 , giving @xmath108 . on the other hand , in a state with @xmath109",
    "then @xmath110 and @xmath111 , at low temperatures this gives @xmath112 .",
    "in general , one expects a crossover between these two limits as @xmath54 is increased from @xmath113 , with the crossover occuring near @xmath114 .",
    "figure 2(c ) shows the distribution of the order parameter @xmath94 at our numerically estimated critical point , @xmath115 , for various system sizes @xmath116 .",
    "these distributions are rescaled to have a mean of zero and a variance of unity : the variable @xmath117 .",
    "the key point is that the shapes of the curves do not depend on the system size , as expected at a critical point .",
    "these critical distributions are universal : fig .",
    "[ fig - tpm - field](c ) also shows the corresponding data for a two - dimensional ising model at the critical point  @xcite .",
    "the distributions match well , indicating that the system is in the ising univerality class .",
    "we also calculated the ratio of the susceptibilities @xmath118 at criticality , for the system sizes @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we find @xmath121 .",
    "theory predicts that this ratio should scale as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the exponent associated with the field conjugate to the order parameter  @xcite . for @xmath3-ising universality",
    ", one has @xmath124 which yields a prediction of @xmath125 for the ratio of susceptibilities .",
    "hence , these results are also consistent with @xmath3-ising universality .",
    "bringing together these results , we arrive at the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - eps - phase ] .",
    "we re - introduce the temperature @xmath126 as an explicit parameter and plot the phase diagrams as a function of @xmath127 and @xmath128 since this is conventional representation in supercooled ( glassy ) liquids .",
    "the form of this phase diagram was proposed in  @xcite",
    ". however , the results here are not consistent with the arguments presented in that work for the location and universality class of the critical point .",
    "our finding that the critical point is in the ising class is interesting , since this is the expected result from other general arguments @xcite , and what is observed in simulation of coupled liquids @xcite .",
    "however , a key feature of the plaquette models is that the first - order transition line does not intersect the @xmath129 axis except at @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "the tpm falls into a category of glassy models that are thermodynamically simple but where glassy behaviour arises because of non - trivial dynamical pathways to the equilibrium state at low temperature @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dynamics of the tpm @xcite is closely related to that of a two - dimensional east model @xcite .",
    "many kinetically constrained models , including the east model , display dynamical phase transitions  phase transitions in the space of trajectories  between a phase with a high dynamical activity , @xmath131 , and one with low dynamical activity @xcite . for these lattice models , the activity @xmath131 is defined as the total number of configuration changes in a trajectory @xcite . by coupling a field @xmath132 to the dynamical activity one can define the so - called @xmath132-ensemble ( also known as the exponentially biased or tilted ensemble ) where the probability of obtaining a trajectory @xmath133 of total time extension @xmath134 , is re - weighted by its activity @xcite @xmath135 here @xmath136 is the probability of the trajectory @xmath137 in the @xmath132-ensemble , @xmath138 is the unbiased probability of this trajectory ( the one generated by the actual dynamics of the system ) , and @xmath139 is the moment generating function of the activity @xmath131 , in effect a partition sum for trajectories . for long times",
    "@xmath139 takes on a large - deviation form @xcite , @xmath140 where @xmath141 plays the role of a dynamical free - energy , and is the scaled cumulant generating function of the activity .",
    "the mean time - intensive activity of trajectories in the @xmath132-ensemble , @xmath142 where the average is w.r.t .  the ensemble , can thus be obtained from @xmath143 .",
    "dynamical  or `` space - time ''  phase transitions manifest as singularities in @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "we also define the susceptibilty @xmath144    like the east model , the dynamical relaxation of the tpm is hierarchical , due to energy barriers to relaxation that are logarithmic in the linear size of relaxing regions @xcite .",
    "this in turn leads to a `` parabolic '' @xcite super - arrhenius law for the typical relaxation time in equilibrium as a function of temperature .",
    "given the similar dynamical properties of the tpm and the east model dynamics , a natural question is whether the tpm also displays active - inactive `` space - time '' transitions .    in order to answer this question",
    "numerically we make use of transition path sampling ( tps ) @xcite to efficiently sample trajectories in the @xmath132-ensemble . for the purposes of numerical efficiency we exploit the fact that different trajectory ensembles can be defined by fixing different dynamical quantities , such that for long trajectories these distinct ensembles become equivalent @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to what occurs with standard configuration ensembles in equilibrium statistical mechanics in the large size limit .",
    "we consider in particular the @xmath145-ensemble introduced in @xcite , that is , the ensemble of trajectories with fixed number of configuration changes , i.e.  activity , @xmath131 but where the overall trajectory time extension @xmath134 fluctuates .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath132-ensemble above is one where trajectories are of fixed overall time but their activity fluctuates . for large @xmath131 and @xmath134 these ensembles can be shown to be equivalent @xcite . for the case of the tpm",

    "one expects both @xmath154 and @xmath155 to be independent of @xmath116 , so the sharper crossover at @xmath152 is again consistent with an underlying phase transition . ]",
    "in order to explore whether the static and dynamical transitions found above for the tpm are present in dimensions other than two it is of interest to generalise the tpm to higher dimensions .",
    "one of the reasons is that if one wishes to consider plaquette models to study `` quenched '' coupled replicas  @xcite or `` random pinning ''  @xcite the distinction between two and three dimensions may be very significant , due to the inability of two - dimensional systems in random fields to support first - order static transitions @xcite .",
    "here we introduce a three - dimensional model that is similar to the tpm .",
    "the model we consider is defined on a three - dimensional body - centred cubic ( bcc ) lattice .",
    "the `` plaquettes '' are upward - pointing square - based pyramids , each containing five spins . considering the standard bcc unit cell ,",

    ". however , these deviations from the one - to - one correspondence are irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "if the trajectory length @xmath134 is less than the time required for escape from the metastable state , similar inactive trajectories can be generated with unbiased ( @xmath186 ) dynamics , by taking initial conditions from low - energy metastable states .",
    "transformation of such a trajectory into a _",
    "typical _ equilibrium trajectory involves the introduction of an active space - time bubble , which subsequently grows to macroscopic size .",
    "the connection with metastability arises because if one introduces a small active bubble within an inactive trajectory , one expects to incur a cost in probability ( if this were not the case , the state would not be metastable since it would readily relax back to equilibrium ) . as in the case of overlap fluctuations , the critical bubble size and the probability barrier increase as @xmath132",

    "evidence for phase coexistence induced by @xmath132 and @xmath72-fields have both been presented in atomistic models  @xcite . by contrast , in kinetically constrained models , dynamical phase coexistence can be induced by the @xmath132-field  @xcite but there is no such transition as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "metastable states do exist in these systems  @xcite , so phase coexistence at positive @xmath132 may be expected , as argued above .",
    "however , this metastability does not lead to a phase coexistence for any positive @xmath72  the reason is that the `` dynamical '' metastability that occurs in kcms appears because thermal noise only generates a certain subset of the overlap fluctuations that are possible within the metastable state .",
    "if all fluctuations in the overlap are possible , one finds that localised low - overlap regions grow easily in these systems .",
    "this means that there is no barrier between active and inactive states in the coupled - replica construction .",
    "it is only within the dynamical @xmath132-ensemble that the metastability becomes apparent , due the restriction on the kinds of fluctuation that are generated by the thermal noise .    finally , it is important to note that the inactive and high - overlap states in figs .",
    "[ fig - eps - phase ] and  [ fig - spym - s - ens ] are structurally distinct from their equilbrium counterparts .",

    "such system of @xmath194 coupled replicas has an energy @xmath195 using the methods of refs .  @xcite it is easy to prove that the partition sum of the @xmath185-dimensional problem also has an exact duality : @xmath196 where we have assumed periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction , and @xmath197 and @xmath198 are related again by .",
    "similar results were found in @xcite for other classes of plaquette models . given this duality",
    "we expect the phenomenology of this many - replica system to be similar to that of two replicas , except that any phase transitions should be in the @xmath185-dimensional ising universality class ( assuming that both longitudinal and transverse dimensions are taken to infinity in the thermodynamic limit ) .",

    "this in turn can be related to the generator of ( imaginary time ) quantum evolution in the usual manner @xcite when the transverse coupling is large and the longitudinal one small [ @xmath203 , so that @xmath204 , with @xmath205 where @xmath206 the hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) generates dynamics in the transverse direction . while it is not derived from a stochastic operator it has the basic features of the generator @xcite for the dynamical ensemble defined in ( [ s - ens ] ) : an off - diagonal part ( the @xmath207 terms ) that perform configuration changes and a diagonal part ( the @xmath208 ) plaquette terms associated to the escape rate .",

    "plaquette spin models have several features that make them attractive for studies of the glass transition .",
    "as we have shown here , exact results can be derived , which guide numerical studies of phase behaviour and many - body correlations .",
    "the models are also computationally much less demanding than atomistic models of supercooled liquids , so that ( for example ) finite size scaling over a large range of system sizes can be performed , to analyse phase transitions",
    ". the equilibrium relaxation of the models follows a dynamical facilitation scenario , in which point defects play a central role .",
    "however , there are strong many - body correlations , and the statistics of overlap fluctuations are rich and complex , as anticipated in the theory of franz and parisi  @xcite . in this sense , the models provide a bridge between different theories . indeed ,",
    "as argued in  @xcite , one might describe plaquette models by a modified form of rfot , but with two important caveats : ( i ) the analogue of the kauzmann transition occurs at zero temperature in these models ( ii ) the interfacial cost associated with growing droplets of a new state within a typical equilibrium state scales logarithmically in the droplet size ( not as a power law as anticipated by rfot ) .",
    "looking forward , we hope that further work on plaquette models ( particularly in @xmath212 ) will show to what extent mean - field  @xcite and rfot ideas can be modified to apply in this setting .",
    "we can imagine that the apparently different physical pictures envisaged by thermodynamic and dynamical theories of the glass transition  @xcite might _ both _ be applicable in these models .",
