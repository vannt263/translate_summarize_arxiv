    "the mass of a star is a key factor in determining the stellar evolution .",
    "low - mass stars developing a degenerate core can evolve to the white dwarf stage .",
    "evolutionary models of massive stars , with the main sequence mass exceeding @xmath3 show that their evolution proceeds through sequences of consecutive stages of nuclear burning until the iron core is formed .",
    "the formation of @xmath4 nucleus , with the maximum binding energy per nucleus , indicates the beginning of the end of massive star s life as a normal star .",
    "the interior composition of a massive star in a very advanced stage of evolution prior to core collapse reveal a shell structure .",
    "each shell has different chemical composition of gradually heavier elements .",
    "after the nuclear fuel is exhausted in a star , nuclear fusion in the central part of the star can no longer supply enough energy to sustain a high thermal pressure .",
    "the obtained theoretical models of the evolved massive stars indicate that they develop central iron cores of mass @xmath5 with the electron gas as the dominant source of pressure . both thermal pressure and the pressure of degenerate electron gas attempt to support the core and determine the following equation of state of the innermost region of the star @xcite @xmath6 in this equation @xmath7 is the electron concentration , @xmath8 is the density , @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath10 is the adiabatic exponent .",
    "owing to the high temperature of the core the adiabatic exponent is close to the critical value 4/3 and the core become dynamically unstable .",
    "the collapse of the core is accelerated by the combination of two mechanisms @xcite : reactions of electron capture and photodisintegration of iron - peak nuclei into @xmath11 particles @xmath12 .",
    "iron dissociation is an endothermic reaction , the energy cost equals 124.4 mev , which comes from the kinetic energy of nuclei and electrons and decreases their thermal pressure .",
    "the resulting pressure deficit is compensated by a further contraction of the core .",
    "electron capture occurs on nuclei and on free protons , diminishes the electron fraction @xmath13 and also leads to pressure deficit . as a consequence the core collapse sets in and the star undergoes supernova explosion , ejecting a large part of its mass .",
    "dynamical conditions in the central region of the star split the core into two separate parts : homologously collapsing inner core and the free falling outer one .",
    "after the inner core reaches the density comparable with the nuclear density , the equation of state stiffens , nuclear forces are expected to resist compression and stop the collapse .",
    "the bounced inner core settles into a hydrostatic configuration in the dynamical time scale of milliseconds . at the boundary between the inner core and",
    "the supersonically falling outer core a pressure wave , which originates from the center , become a shock wave .",
    "the shock wave travels into the outer core through the material that is falling towards the center .",
    "this outgoing shock dissociates the iron nuclei into protons and neutrons .",
    "the shocked region attains high temperature at comparatively low densities . under these conditions",
    "electron degeneracy is not high and relativistic positrons are thermally created .",
    "the thermal energy is carried out by neutrinos which are produced in the following reactions @xmath14 , @xmath15 . within the shock and in the region behind the shock the velocity of the infalling matter",
    "is significantly reduced and the falling matter eventually settles onto the newly formed protoneutron star .",
    "electron neutrinos produced in @xmath16 carry out electron - type lepton number .",
    "deleptonization in the outer envelope proceeds faster than that in the inner core . after stellar collapse",
    "the electron lepton number is trapped inside the matter .",
    "the collapse of an iron core of a massive star leads to the formation of a core residue , namely a proto - neutron star which can be considered as an intermediate stage before the formation of a cold compact neutron star .",
    "after the core collapse the electron lepton number is trapped inside the matter .",
    "this leads to large electron neutrino @xmath17 chemical potential .",
    "evolution of a proto - neutron star which proceeds owing to the neutrino and photon emission causes the star change itself from a hot , bloated object into a cold compact neutron star and can be described in terms of separate phases starting from the moment when the star becomes gravitationally decoupled from the expanding ejection . through the events which lead up to the formation of a neutron star , two limiting cases can be distinguished : the very beginning stage characterized by the low entropy density @xmath18 ( in units of the boltzmann s constant ) , unshocked core with trapped neutrinos @xmath19 and low density , high entropy outer layer .",
    "the final stage is identified with a cold deleptonized object ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "these two distinct stages are separated by the period of deleptonization when the neutrino fraction decreases from the nonzero initial value ( @xmath21 ) which is established by the requirement of the fixed total electron lepton number at @xmath19 , to the final one characterized by @xmath22 .",
    "the presented model of a nascent neutron star is constructed under the assumption that the star can be divided into two main parts : the dense core and the outer layer . as it was stated above , at the very beginning of a proto - neutron star evolution neutrinos",
    "are trapped on the dynamical time scale within the matter both in the core and in the outer layer .",
    "the estimated electron lepton fraction ( @xmath23 ) at trapping , with the value of @xmath24 and the assumption of constant entropy , allows one to specify the star characteristics at the conditions prevailing in the star interior . assuming the evolutionary scenarios presented in the paper by prakash et al.@xcite the following stages in the life of a proto - neutron star have been distinguished :    * stage 1 : the post bounce phase - the bounced inner core settles into a hydrostatic configuration . under the assumption of very low kinetic energy of the matter behind the shock also the structure of the outer envelope",
    "can be approximated by hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "thus a proto - neutron star model immediately after the collapse can be constructed basing on the following physical conditions : the low entropy core @xmath18 with trapped neutrinos @xmath25 is surrounded by high entropy @xmath26 outer layer also with trapped neutrinos .",
    "the energy is carried out from a proto - neutron star by neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors whereas lepton number is lost by the emission of electron neutrinos which are produced in the @xmath27 process @xmath16 .",
    "deleptonization in the outer envelope proceeds faster than that in the inner core . *",
    "stage 2 : deleptonization of the outer layer is completed .",
    "the physical conditions that characterized the whole system are as follows : the core with the entropy @xmath28 and @xmath25 and the deleptonized outer envelop with @xmath28 and @xmath22 .",
    "* stage 3 : during this stage the deleptonization of the core takes place , after which the core has neutrino - free , high entropy @xmath28 matter .",
    "thermally produced neutrino pairs of all flavors are abundant , and they are emitted with very similar luminosities from the thermal bath of the core . * stage 4 : cold , catalyzed object .",
    "the solution of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation of tolman , oppenheimer and volkov which allows one to construct a theoretical model of a proto - neutron star and to specify and analyze its properties demands the specification of the equation of state .",
    "the mean field approach to the relativistic theory of hadrons has been used extensively in order to describe properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "the degrees of freedom relevant to this theory are nucleons interacting through the exchange of isoscalar - scalar @xmath29 , isoscalar - vector @xmath30 , isovector - vector @xmath8 and the pseudo - scalar @xmath31 mesons . in the relativistic mean",
    "field approach nucleons are considered as dirac quasiparticles moving in classical meson fields . the contribution of the @xmath31 meson vanishes at the mean field level .",
    "the chiral effective lagrangian proposed by furnstahl , serot and tang constructed on the basis of effective field theory and density functional theory for hadrons gave in the result the extension of the standard relativistic mean field theory and introduced additional non - linear scalar - vector and vector - vector self - interactions .",
    "this lagrangian in general includes all non - renormalizable couplings consistent with the underlying symmetries of qcd and can be considered as the one of the effective field theory of low energy qcd . applying the dimensional analysis of georgi and manohar @xcite , @xcite and the concept of naturalness one can expand the nonlinear lagrangian and organize it in increasing powers of the fields and their derivatives and truncated at given level of accuracy @xcite . in the high density regime in neutron star interiors when the fermi energy of nucleons exceeds the hyperon masses additional hadronic states",
    "are produced @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus the considered model involves the full octet of baryons interacting through the exchange of @xmath29 mesons which produce the medium range attraction and the exchange of @xmath30 mesons responsible for the short range repulsion .",
    "the model also includes the isovector mesons @xmath32 . in order to reproduce attractive hyperon - hyperon interaction two additional hidden - strangeness mesons , which do not couple to nucleons ,",
    "have been introduced , namely the scalar meson @xmath33 ( denoted as @xmath34 ) and the vector meson @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "if the truncated lagrangian includes terms up to the forth order it can be written in the following form :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 . the covariant derivative @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 whereas @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the field tensors @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 denotes baryon mass whereas @xmath46 @xmath47 are masses assigned to the meson fields , @xmath48 is the nucleon mass .",
    "there are two parameter sets presented in the original paper by furnstahl et al @xcite , @xcite g1 and g2 which have been determined by calculating nuclear properties such as binding energies , charge distribution and spin - orbit splitting for a selected set of nuclei @xcite . for the purposes of this paper",
    "the g2 parameter set has been chosen .",
    "calculations performed with the use of this parameter set properly reproduce properties of finite nuclei and make it possible to compare the obtained results with the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) calculations for nuclear and neutron matter above the saturation density . the dbhf method results in a rather soft equation of state in the vicinity of the saturation point and for higher densities .",
    "calculations performed on the basis of the effective fst lagrangian with the use of the g2 parameter sets predict similar , soft equation of state . due to the fact that the expectation value of the @xmath8 meson field is an order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath30 meson field , the lagrangian function ( [ lag1 ] ) does not include the quartic @xmath8 meson term .",
    "in addition , as this paper deals with the problem of infinite nuclear matter the terms in the lagrangian function in the paper @xcite involving tensor couplings and meson field gradients have been excluded .",

    "the scalar meson coupling to hyperons can be calculated from the potential depth of a hyperon in the saturated nuclear matter @xcite @xmath69 the considered model does not include @xmath70 hyperons due to the remaining uncertainty of the form of their potential in nuclear matter at saturation density @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the scalar sector",
