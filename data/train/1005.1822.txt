    "the study of exactly soluble field theories has always received a good deal of attention in the hope that they might shed some light on more realistic theories .",
    "one such model is the schwinger model or quantum electrodynamics for massless fermions in two space - time dimensions @xcite .",
    "it serves as an important tool in illustrating various ( related ) field theoretical concepts such as mass generation , dynamical symmetry breaking , charge shielding or fermion trapping @xcite .",
    "more recently , the schwinger model and its extensions have been used as toy models for studying baryon number violating processes @xcite . since the semiclassical expansion in the standard model breaks down at the interesting energies or temperatures ,",
    "it is important to compare the realistic calculations to the corresponding ones for simpler models . as simple soluble models which , for the problem at hand , have features identical to the standard model ,",
    "the non - linear sigma model @xcite and the schwinger model ( coupled to a scalar field ) @xcite have been considered .",
    "the influence of an external gravitational field on the ultra - violet and infra - red properties of the model has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "this problem is not completely solved up to now but the partial results indicate that qualitatively all long - distance features of the flat - space - time solution persist in curved backgrounds .    the zero - temperature schwinger model has been solved some time ago by using operator methods @xcite and more recently in the path integral formulation @xcite .",
    "some properties of the model ( e.g. the non - trivial vacuum structure ) are more transparent in the operator approach and others ( e.g. the role of the chiral anomaly ) are better seen in the path integral approach .    when studying the finite temperature @xmath1-sigma model coupled to fermions ( as a relevant model for the @xmath2-number violating processes in the electro - weak theory @xcite ) we realized that no satisfactory solution of the simpler finite - temperature schwinger model is available , at least in the path integral approach .",
    "therefore we decided to investigate the schwinger model at finite temperature and in particular determine the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate by using functional integral methods .",
    "to study the temperature effects we solve the schwinger model on the two - dimensional torus to avoid the infra - red divergences , which sometimes plague the analysis of two - dimensional gauge theories .",
    "previous finite - volume solutions of @xmath3 have clarified various aspects of the model . for example the role of the nonintegrable phase factor @xmath4 has been understood by studying the model on a cylinder , that is by considering the zero - temperature model where the spatial dimension is given by a circle @xcite .",
    "recently the schwinger model has been solved in the path integral approach on the 2-dimensional sphere and the role of the fermionic zero modes has been emphazise @xcite .",
    "also it has been considered on a 2-dimensional disk assuming the most general ( local ) self - adjoint boundary conditions for the fermions @xcite",
    ".    however , these geometries are not the proper ones to study finite temperature effects .",
    "for that we must assume that the fields are ( anti)-periodic in the time direction with period @xmath5 . in order to justify the manipulations below ( in particular the treatment of the grassmannian integrals ) we prefer to work on a finite space - time volume such that the relevant wave - operators possess discrete spectra .",
    "thus we assume that the spatial extension of space - time is finite as well and consider the schwinger model on a torus @xmath6\\times [ 0,l]$ ] with volume @xmath7 .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions in the spatial direction . only at the end of our calculations",
    "do we let the spatial extension @xmath8 tend to infinity .",
    "the only other solution of the schwinger model on the torus we are aware of , besides assuming periodic boundary conditions for dirac - khler fermions instead of finite temperature ones , concentrated mainly on finding and discussing the fermionic zero - modes @xcite . also , our trivialization of the @xmath9-bundle over the torus is different from the one in @xcite but is very convenient for determining the explicit spectrum of the dirac operator .",
    "our main results are the analytic form of the ( zero - mode truncated ) effective actions and zero - modes in the various topological sectors , the two - point green function of @xmath10 on the torus and as a consequence the explicit formulae ( 5.9 ) , ( 5.10 ) and ( 5.12 ) for the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate @xmath11 .",
    "we find that @xmath12 is equal to @xmath13 for @xmath14 , in agreement with the zero - temperature solutions [ 7,9 ] , and tends to @xmath15 for temperature large compared to the induced photon mass @xmath16 .",
    "our high temperature result differs by a factor @xmath17 from the only other ( formal ) finite temperature path integral solution we are aware of @xcite .",
    "also , the torus calculation nicely splits the chiral anomaly responsible for the non - vanishing condensate , into its high- and low energy parts .",
    "the first ( coming from the gauge invariant ultraviolet regularisation ) only affects the numerical value of @xmath11 , whereas the latter ( coming from the chiral asymetry of the zero - energy sector ) is responsible for the non - zero @xmath11 .",
    "this is the reason why ordinary perturbation theory , although leading to the correct @xmath18-contribution via the wellknown anomaly graph , fails to predict a non - vanishing condensate . at the end",
    "we obtain analytic expressions for ( thermal ) wilson loop correlators and in particular their temperature dependence as well as the gauge invariant fermionic two - point functions .",
    "in this section we recapitulate briefly the euklidean schwinger model @xcite , using functional methods .",
    "we emphasize the less known features involved when considering the model on a torus instead on the plane .",
    "the schwinger model is defined by the action @xmath19=\\ha\\int d^2x\\,e^2-\\int d^2x\\,\\pb i\\di\\psi,\\eqno(1.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath20 note that in two space - time dimensions the electric charge has the dimension of an inverse length , contrary to the situation in four dimensions .",
    "the model is superrenormalizable and requires no infinite renormalization besides a trivial redefinition of the zero energy density .",
    "the generating functional for the green functions is @xmath21={\\cal c}^{-1}\\int \\cd a\\cd \\pb\\cd \\psi \\;e^{-s[a,\\pb,\\psi]-s_{gf}[a ] + \\int d^2x \\big(a_\\mu j^\\mu+\\be \\psi+\\pb\\eta\\big)},\\eqno(1.2)\\ ] ] where @xmath22 $ ] contains the terms due to gauge fixing and @xmath23 resp .",
    "@xmath24 are @xmath25-number and grassman - valued currents respectively .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath26 is chosen such that @xmath27=1 $ ] .",
    "first we evaluate the fermionic path integral @xmath28=\\int \\cd \\pb\\cd \\psi \\;e^{\\int \\pb i\\di \\psi + \\int d^2x \\big(\\be \\psi+\\pb\\eta\\big)},\\eqno(1.3)\\ ] ] and treat the photon-field as external field in this first step .    on the torus the dirac operator may possess normalizable zero - modes , @xmath29 , and",
    "thus we must allow for such fermionic zero modes in the path integral ( 1.3 ) .",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath30 ( our notation will become clear later on ) normalizable zero - modes @xmath31 .",
    "in addition there are an infinite number of excited modes @xmath32 with eigenvalues @xmath33 .",
    "the number of zero - modes can be determined as follows :    first we note that since @xmath34 anti - commutes with the dirac operator the excited modes come in pairs @xmath35 so that @xmath36 and @xmath37 have eigenvalues @xmath38 and @xmath39 and are orthogonal to each other .",
    "it follows that the contribution of the excited states to the ( supersymmetric ) partition function @xmath40 vanishes . thus the partition function is just the index @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of right handed ( chirality @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 the number of left handed ( @xmath45 ) zero modes .",
    "on the other hand , inserting the small- @xmath46 expansion ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath47 one immediately obtains the index theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath48 which relates the index @xmath49 of the dirac operator to the flux of the electric field .",
    "this formula already shows that there are zero - modes for non - vanishing fluxes @xmath50 . also note that on the torus the flux is quantized in integer muliples of @xmath51",
    "this is really a consequence of the single valuedness of the fermionic wave function ( cocycle condition).the pairing property ( 1.4 ) does not hold for the zero - modes .",
    "indeed , they can be chosen to have fixed chirality since @xmath34 commutes with the dirac operator on the subspace spanned by the zero modes . also ( 1.4 ) would not be valid for the excited modes if we would impose chirality - violating boundary conditions as in @xcite .",
    "but ( anti ) periodic boundary conditions are compatible with the transformation @xmath52 and the identity ( 1.4 ) holds in the present situation.to determine @xmath42 and @xmath44 separately we decompose the gauge potential as @xmath53 that is into a global `` instanton''-type potential @xmath54 with constant field strength , @xmath55 and a local fluctuation @xmath56 about the instanton .",
    "the subtraction of the constant term in ( 1.7 ) is necessary since on the torus the laplacian has the constant zero - mode and is invertible only on functions which integrate to zero . using @xmath57 it is now easy to see that @xmath58 which shows that the number of fermionic zero - modes is independent of @xmath59 and hence is the same for @xmath60 and @xmath54 .",
    "but for the instanton potentials @xmath54 @xmath61 and since @xmath62 is a non - negative operator , all zero modes are either right- or left - handed for non - vanishing fluxes . only in the zero - instanton sector @xmath63",
    "can it happen that there are both right- and left - handed zero modes .",
    "for example , for a vanishing gauge potential there is one right - handed and one left - handed zero mode .",
    "what we have shown then is that for @xmath64 there are exactly @xmath65 zero modes .",
    "if the flux is positive they are all right - handed , else they are all left - handed .    after having counted the number of zero modes we proceed by expanding the electron-field in an adapted orthonormal eigen - base as @xmath66 and similarly @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 split into a zero - mode part and an excited part . inserting this decomposition into ( 1.3 ) and using @xmath69 the grassmannian integral over the @xmath70 s",
    "can easily be done since the action does not depend on them .",
    "this way one finds for the zero - mode contribution to ( 1.3 ) @xmath71 the remaining @xmath72-integration is performed by shifting the @xmath72 s ( and similarly the @xmath73 s ) according to @xmath74 after this shift the @xmath72 integration yields @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the determinant with the zero - eigenvalues omitted and @xmath77 is the green function on the space orthogonal to the zero modes .",
    "clearly this function obeys the differential equation @xmath78 is the projection kernel on the zero - mode subspace .",
    "due to the pairing property of the excited modes the excited green function anti - commutes with @xmath34 : @xmath79 inserting now ( 1.10 ) into the path integral for the ( fermionic ) partition function ( 1.3 ) we end up with @xmath80=\\prod_1^{\\vk}\\,(\\bar\\eta,\\psi_p)(\\pb_p,\\eta)\\ ; \\;e^{-\\int\\bar\\eta(x ) g_e(a;x , y)\\eta(y)}\\;{\\det}^\\pr(i\\di).\\eqno(1.12)\\ ] ] thus to determine @xmath81 for a fixed potential we need to compute the @xmath30 zero - modes of the dirac operator , the determinant of @xmath82 with the zero - modes omitted and the excited green function .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) fermionic @xmath83-point functions for a given @xmath60-field are now obtained by differentiation with respect to the external currents @xmath84",
    "@xmath85 \\vert_{\\be = \\eta = 0}\\eqno(1.13)\\ ] ] using ( 1.12 ) in this formula we can immediately read off that    1 .   the fermionic partition function @xmath86={\\det}(i\\di)\\eqno(1.14)\\ ] ] which enters in the normalization constant @xmath26 in ( 1.2 )",
    "is only non - zero if the dirac operator possesses no zero modes that is for gauge field with vanishing flux .",
    "the @xmath17-point functions are non - zero only if @xmath60 admits either no or one zero - mode , that is for @xmath87 or @xmath88 and then @xmath89 from ( 1.11c ) it follows that the expectation values of @xmath90 , where @xmath91 are the chiral projections , are non - vanishing only for @xmath88 in which cases the dirac operator has one zero mode @xmath92 of chirality @xmath93 , and then @xmath94 the higher @xmath83-point functions are obtained similarly .",
    "for example , for the @xmath95-point functions only gauge potentials with no , one or two zero modes contribute .",
    "in particular for the expectation value of the operator with ( chiral ) charge zero @xmath96 only the trivial sector with no zero - modes yields a non - vanishing result .",
    "this explains why earlier solutions of the schwinger model on the plane ( in which the non - trivial sectors have been neglected ) yield the correct result for this expectation value and thus ( via clustering ) the correct result for the chiral condensate .",
    "note that the excited fermionic green function does not appear in the expectation values ( 1.16 ) , and this simplifies the computation of the chiral condensate considerably .",
    "more generally , the expectation values of the charge @xmath97 operators @xmath98 are non - zero only for potentials with fluxes @xmath99 , and then only the zero modes and effective actions , but not the excited green functions occur in the expectation values .",
    "in this section we compute the @xmath59-dependence of the effective actions @xmath100 for the general gauge potentials ( 1.7 ) by integrating the chiral anomaly .",
    "since there are some subtleties when zero - modes are present we derive the local @xmath59-dependent part of the effective actions , although some of our arguments are not new @xcite.to determine the @xmath59-dependence of the effective actions we consider the one - parametric family of dirac - operators @xmath101 which interpolates between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and calculate the variation of the zeta - function regularized determinants @xcite @xmath104 the zeta - function is defined as as the analytic continuation of @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the @xmath70-dependent excited eigenvalues of the squared dirac operator , to the whole complex @xmath107-plane . using ( 2.1 ) in the feynman - hellman formula",
    "@xmath108 the variation of the zeta - function can be written as @xmath109 this can be further rewritten as a mellin transform @xmath110 where the trace is only to be taken over the excited states . inserting the asymptotic expansion ( 1.5 ) from which we must subtract the projection density @xmath111 ( see ( 1.11b ) onto the zero modes we find @xmath112 to integrate over @xmath70 we observe that the zero - modes of @xmath113 and @xmath114 are related as @xmath115 with the negative sign in the exponent for right - handed and the positive sign for left - handed zero - modes .",
    "these modes are in general not orthonormal , and the normmatrix @xmath116 is not the identity so that the projection density reads @xmath117 now it follows from ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) that @xmath118 and this formula can be used to integrate the anomaly equation ( 2.3 ) from @xmath119 to @xmath120 .",
    "together with ( 2.2 ) we end up with @xmath121 which is the ( almost ) factorization of the determinants into a global , @xmath54-dependent , and local , @xmath59-dependent , part .",
    "the factorization is not complete since @xmath122 still contains a coupling between the instanton potential @xmath54 and the local fluctuation @xmath123 via ( 2.4 ) .",
    "since @xmath124 in ( 1.7 ) depends on both @xmath50 and @xmath59 , there is also an apparent coupling in the last factor in ( 2.7 ) .",
    "however we shall see later that not all functions @xmath59 are permitted and that for the allowed ones this factor does not depend on @xmath50 . also note that the local part does not depend on the geometry of the torus .",
    "in particular the induced photon mass @xmath125 is the same as on the infinite plane .      with the factorizations ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.7 ) of the zero modes and effective actions into local and global factors",
    "the problem of finding the @xmath17-point functions ( 1.16 ) ( or @xmath83-point functions of charge @xmath97 operators ) reduces to the problem of computing the zero modes and effective actions for the instanton potentials @xmath54 . for",
    "that we need to know the explicit form of these potentials.an instanton potential can always be decomposed as @xmath126 with constant @xmath127 .",
    "the least trivial term proportional to @xmath50 yields the constant field strength and corresponds to a particular trivialization of the @xmath9-bundle over the torus . in other words ,",
    "the gauge potentials at @xmath128 and @xmath129 are necessarily related by a non - trivial gauge transformation @xmath130 accordingly the fermionic wave functions transform as @xmath131 these boundary conditions must be supplemented by the finite temperature boundary conditions in the @xmath132-direction @xmath133 the constant terms in ( 3.1 ) are the harmonic pieces of the gauge potential . even in the trivial sector @xmath87",
    "they yield the ( dynamical ) nonintegrable phase factors @xmath134\\eqno(3.3)\\ ] ] for loops which wind @xmath135-times around the torus in the @xmath132 direction and @xmath136-times in the @xmath137-direction.the last term in ( 3.1 ) is a pure gauge term and will drop out at the end of the calculations.now we consider the sector with @xmath87 and those with @xmath64 in turn :      in this sector @xmath138 is simple and possesses the double degenerate eigenvalues ( of course , the spectrum is not affected by the gauge term in ( 3.1 ) ) @xmath139 the corresponding zeta - functions @xmath140 are the generalized epstein functions @xcite . applying the poisson - resummation formula the derivative at @xmath141",

    "we have adopted the conventions in @xcite for the theta - functions : @xmath144(z , i\\tau)=\\sum_{z}e^{-\\pi\\tau(n+a)^2 + 2\\pi i(n+a ) ( z+b)}.\\eqno(3.5c)\\ ] ] taking the degeneracy of the eigenvalues into account , the zeta - function regularized determinants ( 2.2a ) in the sector with no zero modes are @xmath145(0,i\\tau)\\big\\vert^2.\\eqno(3.6)\\ ] ]      we have seen that the excited eigenmodes of the dirac operator come in pairs with opposite eigenvalues . since @xmath34 commutes with the squared dirac operator the chiral projections @xmath146 of these modes are eigenmodes of @xmath147 .",
    "thus the excited eigenmodes of the squared dirac operator come in pairs as well and two partners have the same energies @xmath148 but opposite chiralities .",
    "we have also shown that there are exactly @xmath149 chiral zero modes of the dirac operator and hence of @xmath147 . since @xmath150 in ( 1.19 ) differs only by the constant @xmath151 in the two chiral sectors , the @xmath30 zero modes with chirality , say @xmath152 , are at the same time excited modes with energies @xmath151 and chirality @xmath153 . due to pairing there are also @xmath30 excited modes with chirality @xmath152 , and so on .",
    "thus @xmath62 possesses the following spectrum @xmath154 note that , contrary to the situation in the zero - instanton sector , the spectrum does not depend on the harmonic part @xmath155 of the gauge potential @xmath54.the zeta - function is now proportional to the ordinary riemann zeta - function and one obtains @xmath156 for the determinant of the non - zero eigenvalues .    inserting ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.8 ) into ( 2.7 )",
    "we end up with the following formulae for the determinants in the sectors with @xmath30 zero modes : @xmath157 @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the theta - function in ( 3.6 ) and we have expressed @xmath124 in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath50 ( see ( 1.7 ) ) and made the dependence on the dimensionful electric charge explicit ( recall that @xmath125 ) .",
    "according to ( 2.4 ) we only need to evaluate the zero - modes of @xmath62",
    ". also we shall only consider expectation values of gauge invariant operators and thus may set the gauge part in ( 3.1 ) to zero . since the gauge potentials ( 3.1 ) do not depend on time",
    "the eigenmodes should be proportional to @xmath160 .",
    "the finite temperature boundary conditions ( 3.2c ) then require that the momentum is quantized as @xmath161 with integer @xmath162 . if we further eliminate the @xmath163-part of the instanton potential we are lead to the following ansatz @xmath164 for the zero modes . inserting this ansatz into the zero mode equation @xmath165 yields @xmath166 which shows that @xmath167 is the ground state wave function of a harmonic oscillator and thus @xmath168,\\eqno(4.1)\\ ] ] where we have used the index theorem ( 1.6 ) .",
    "these functions do not obey the boundary condition ( 3.2b ) but the correct eigenmodes can be constructed as superpositions of them . for that one",
    "notes that @xmath169 so that the sums @xmath170 obey the boundary conditions and thus are the @xmath30 required zero - modes of the dirac operator .",
    "the overall factor normalizes these functions to one ( the norm can be computed by using 4.2 ) ) . also",
    ", modes with different @xmath162 are orthogonal to each other , so that the system ( 4.3 ) forms an orthonormal basis of the zero - mode subspace .",
    "these functions can be written in terms of jacobi theta functions as ( we drop a constant phase ) @xmath171}\\;\\ ; \\theta\\big[{x^1/l+(p\\!-\\!a_0)/k\\atop k x^0/\\beta+a_1}\\big](0,i\\vk\\tau ) , \\eqno(4.4)\\ ] ] where @xmath172 has been introduced in ( 3.5a ) .",
    "since these modes are orthonormal the determinant of the norm matrix @xmath173 in ( 3.9 ) is just one .",
    "the unnormalized zero modes which enter the normmatrix @xmath174 can now be obtained from the zero modes ( 4.4 ) by the transformation ( 2.4 ) with @xmath175 .",
    "these completes our discussion of the zero - mode sector .",
    "we have computed all @xmath30 zero modes of @xmath103 explicitly in terms of jacobi - theta functions.for the two - point functions of interest ( 1.16 ) only the sector with one zero mode contributes , and since then the normalized zero mode is just @xmath176 , the normalization constant cancels with @xmath174 in ( 3.9 ) so that @xmath177 where @xmath178 are the theta - functions in ( 4.4 ) with @xmath179 and @xmath180 : @xmath181(0,i\\tau ) \\eqno(4.5b)\\ ] ] ( we used that the modulus of this function is unchanged if the sign of the `` lower parameter '' is changed ) and the @xmath182 sign refers to the chirality of the zero modes.our trivialization of the @xmath9 bundle which leads to the form ( 3.1 ) of the instanton potential differs from the one chosen in @xcite and so do our zero modes .",
    "but one can show @xcite that the modes in @xcite are obtained from our modes ( 4.4 ) by the corresponding change of trivialization , as required .      after having solved the fermionic integration we are now left with the functional integrals over the @xmath60-field . in particular we shall evaluate the two point functions @xmath183 where @xmath124 is given in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath50 in ( 1.7 ) .",
    "clearly , since the integrands are expressed in terms of @xmath184 it is natural to change the integration variables from @xmath60 to these variables.first one notes that there is a one to one correspondence between @xmath124 and @xmath185 .",
    "this becomes a one to one correspondence to @xmath186 if we demand that @xmath59 is orthogonal to the kernel of @xmath187 , that is if it integrates to zero .",
    "second , for given @xmath186 the nonintegrable phase factors ( 3.3 ) are in one to one correspondence to the phases @xmath188 , and thus to the @xmath127 modulo @xmath189 .",
    "furthermore , from @xmath190 we see that there is also a one to one correspondence between the divergence of @xmath60 and functions @xmath191 which integrate to zero .",
    "to summarize : we have shown that the transformation @xmath192 defined in ( 1.7 ) and ( 3.1 ) , is one to one.next we need to calculate the jacobian of this transformation .",
    "this is conveniently done by expanding all fields in eigenmodes of @xmath193 , e.g. @xmath194 where @xmath195 is excluded because of the constraint on @xmath59 in ( 5.2 ) . in terms of the coefficients the transformations ( 1.7 ) and ( 3.1 )",
    "read for @xmath87 @xmath196 @xmath197 and the jacobian of this transformation is just @xmath198 and thus independent of the dynamical fields . in the nontrivial sectors labelled by @xmath49",
    "we can write @xmath199 and the above transformation applies then to @xmath123 , so that @xmath200 since in expectation values the same jacobian appears in the numerator and denominator we may neglect @xmath201 in what follows .",
    "also , gauge invariant operators ( like in ( 5.1 ) ) are independent of the gauge function @xmath191 and the integration over the @xmath202 drops in expectation values as well ( in our decomposition @xmath203 corresponds to the ghost free lorentz gauge ) . inserting ( 3.9 ) and ( 4.5a ) into ( 5.1 )",

    "let us now derive the low - and high temperature limits in turn : to study the low temperature limit of the chiral condensate we regularize the indiviudal sums in ( 5.9b ) as @xcite @xmath229 - 4 mm @xmath230 where @xmath231 is eulers constant .",
    "the difference is finite as @xmath107 tends to zero and inserting it into ( 5.9 ) and ( 5.10 ) yields @xmath232 where the last integral represents ( up to a sign ) just the last sum in ( 5.11 ) .",
    "this altenative representation of the chiral condensate for @xmath233 has been derived in the bosonised schwinger model on the cylinder in @xcite .",
    "since the integral @xmath234 tends to zero for low temperatures we find @xmath235 and this is the well known result for the zero temperature schwinger model @xcite.to study the high temperature limit we observe that @xmath236 tends to zero as @xmath237 or if the temperature is big compared to the induced photon mass . in this region @xmath238 thus the chiral condensate vanishes exponentially fast for @xmath239.for the intermediate temperatures @xmath240 we must retreat to numerical methods to evaluate the infinite sum which defines the function @xmath241 appearing in ( 5.10 ) .",
    "the result of the numerical calculations are depicted in figure 1.note how the function @xmath242 resembles the behaviour of an order parameter in a system which suffers a second order phase transition .",
    "however , the chiral condensate does not really vanish at any finite temperature , it tends to zero only exponentially , contrary to the phase transition case .",
    "thus in a strict sense the chiral symmetry remains broken at all finite temperature .",
    "in this section we determine the correlation functions of wilson loops , products of the field strength , thermal wilson loops and gauge invariant fermionic two - point functions .",
    "clearly , for the purely bosonic operators only the zero - instanton sector yields non - vanishing expectation values . since in this sector @xmath243harmonics@xmath244",

    "it follows then that at low temperature the interaction between two charges is exponentially small      the expectation values of a string of thermal wilson loops @xmath270 depend on the harmonics because a thermal wilson loop has winding number one . since @xmath271 the @xmath155-integral for a string of @xmath272 loops becomes @xmath273 the remaining @xmath59-integration yields @xmath274.\\ ] ] inserting the explicit form of @xmath253 ( see above ( 5.7 ) ) one finds the following one- and two - point functions @xmath275 @xmath276 where @xmath277 denotes the function @xmath278 the normalized higher n - point functions @xmath279 are then just products of the normalized two - point function @xmath280 since @xmath281 is to be intepreted as the ( zero energy subtracted ) free energy of @xmath272 static charges at positions @xmath282 , ( 6.10 ) shows that the free energy of @xmath272 charges is just the sum of the free energies of the individual pairs.for @xmath233 the one and two - point functions ( and thus the @xmath272-point functions ) simplify to @xmath283 in complete agreement with the analytically continued one and two - point functions obtained via bosonization in @xcite . note in particular",

    "note that contrary to the bosonic correlators which fall off exponentially due to the mass gap in the spectrum , the chiral fermionic @xmath17-point function falls of like @xmath303 .",
    "this is due to the zero mode fermionic states in the hilbertspace .    in a next step",
    "we will increase the complications by considering the case of again infinite volume but finite temperature .",
    "this time however we must assume the difference of the two arguments of the two - point function to be strictly spacelike ( eg : @xmath304 ) for then the integral on the r.h.s . of ( 6.15 )",
    "vanishes again .",
    "this becomes clear if we notice that now only `` timelike '' derivatives of the bosonic green function appear and these are zero for @xmath304 as can be seen using the sum representation of @xmath294 ( above ( 5.6 ) ) .",
    "hence we have again reduced the problem to the computation of @xmath294 . however , as in the case of coinciding arguments ( chiral condensate ) we could nt find simple expressions representing the infinite sums for finite temperature .",
    "therefore we again retreat to numerical methodes to evaluate ( 6.15 ) .",
    "the results are despicted in figure 2 .",
    "we will not reproduce here the lengthy formulas but emphasize that for non - zero temperature and for @xmath305 , @xmath306 falls of like @xmath307 $ ] .",
    "this is the expected behaviour at large temperature .",
    "returning to ( 5.6 ) and noting that @xmath308 is left invariant under an exchange of @xmath72 with @xmath8 , and that the same is true for @xmath309 , we may view ( 5.10 ) as dependence of the zero - temperature chiral condensate on the spatial extension @xmath8 .",
    "thus figure 1 can be intepreted as the change of @xmath310 due to finite ( spatial ) size effects . in particular ,",
    "if the compactified spatial size shrinks to zero , the chiral condensate behaves as @xmath311 and vanishes exponentially ( and non - analytically ) .    in the decomposition ( 5.4 ) of the bosonic path integral we have integrated over different @xmath9-principal bundles labelled by the index @xmath49 .",
    "we have assumed that the relative normalization between functional integrals with different @xmath49 is one . to recover the @xmath312-vacuum structure @xcite",
    "we must allow for a relative phase @xmath313 between the sectors @xmath49 and @xmath314 ( similarly as in the path integral for a particle on a punctured plane ) .",
    "then the expectation values @xmath315 would pick up the phases @xmath316 and thus the right hand sides of ( 5.10 ) and ( 5.12 - 14 ) would be multiplied by @xmath317 .",
    "the same happens if one adds the explicit @xmath312-dependent term @xmath318 to the classical action ( 1.1 ) .    in the conventional path integral solution of the schwinger model on the plane the zero - temperature result ( 5.13 )",
    "is derived indirectly , via clustering of the @xmath95-point function ( 1.17 ) .",
    "this seems to be necessary since a ( naive ) direct calculation of the chiral condensate yields the wrong result @xmath319 .",
    "this may not come as a surprise since one integrates only over potentials with vanishing fluxes and on the other hand we have seen that on the torus only configurations with fluxes @xmath320 contribute to the expectation value ( 5.13 ) . integrating over all gauge potentials should yield the correct result ( 5.13 ) .",
    "more precisely , on the plane a gauge potential can be decomposed as @xmath321 where @xmath54 is a vortex field @xmath322 and @xmath56 a local fluctuation with vanishing flux about the vortex potential .",
    "one can show that @xmath114 possesses exactly @xmath30 zero modes , where @xmath30 is the integer part of @xmath323 @xcite ( besides these zero modes there is also a resonance state ) .",
    "since only potentials with @xmath324 contribute to the chiral condensate one obtains @xmath325}\\tr\\big(\\psi^\\dagger p_+\\psi\\big ) } { \\int\\limits_{-1\\leq\\phi\\leq 1}d\\phi \\;\\rho(\\phi ) \\int\\cd\\phi\\ , e^{-\\gamma[\\phi]}},\\eqno(7.4)\\ ] ] where we have allowed for a jacobian @xmath326 of the transformation ( 5.2 ) ( without harmonics @xmath155 ) . again the effective action @xmath250 contains two pieces , namely a local part coming from the chiral anomaly and a global vortex determinant .",
    "since on the plane there are nt different topological sectors it would be interesting to see how the @xmath312-parameter emerges in such a calculation .      10 j. schwinger , _ phys . rev .",
