    "the kepler system is the simplest realistic example of a coupled two body system , and belongs to the few systems that can be solved exactly within the framework of newtonian gravity .",
    "it consists of two pointlike objects , characterized only by their masses , and interacting with the gravitational field .",
    "unfortunately , within the framework of general relativity , the two body problem not only lacks of an exact solution .",
    "it is not even well defined , because einstein gravity in four spacetime dimensions does not admit pointlike matter sources .",
    "clearly , this makes general relativity so interesting .",
    "but the obvious drawback is the absence of a simple but still realistic toy model , which is sometimes very useful .",
    "the kepler system is , in a sense , the hydrogen atom of gravity .",
    "the situation is different in three spacetime dimensions , where einstein gravity is not only a much simpler field theory @xcite .",
    "it also admits pointlike matter sources @xcite , and even a more or less straightforward canonical quantization @xcite .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations in three dimensions require the spacetime to be flat outside the matter sources .",
    "there are neither gravitational waves , nor local gravitational forces .",
    "however , the spacetime becomes curved if matter is present .",
    "the simplest example of a non - trivial spacetime is the gravitational field of a massive pointlike particle .",
    "the spacetime is the direct product of a real line with a conical space .",
    "the particle is sitting at the tip , and the deficit angle of the cone is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the rest mass of the particle , and @xmath2 is newton s constant .    in units where the velocity of light is one , @xmath2 has the dimension of an inverse mass or energy .",
    "the inverse @xmath3 is the planck mass .",
    "it is a classical quantity in the sense that @xmath4 is not involved in the definition .",
    "there is thus a certain amount of curvature on the world line of a point particle , which is proportional to its mass .",
    "but this is just a very simple conical singularity in an otherwise flat spacetime .",
    "there is a simple way to visualize a spacetime containing a single point particle .",
    "one starts from a flat three dimensional minkowski space and cuts out a _",
    "wedge_. a wedge is a subset which is bounded by two timelike half planes , whose common boundary is a timelike geodesic .",
    "this geodesic becomes the world line of the particle .",
    "the two half planes are mapped onto each other by a certain isometry of minkowski space .",
    "it is a lorentz rotation about the world line , and the angle of rotation is @xmath0 .",
    "the region inside the wedge is taken away , and the points on the two half planes are identified , according to the lorentz rotation . the result is a locally flat spacetime with a conical singularity on the world line . for a massless particle",
    ", the same procedure can be applied to a pair of half planes , whose common boundary is a lightlike geodesic .",
    "they are then mapped onto each other by a null rotation .",
    "the kepler spacetime contains two particles , and therefore we have to apply this procedure twice .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ wdg ] .",
    "[ wdg ]    unless one of the particles has a deficit angle which is bigger than @xmath5 , hence a mass above @xmath6 , every possible two particle spacetime can be constructed in this way .",
    "the geometry of the spacetime only depends on the relative motion of the particles , which can be read off immediately from the relative orientation of the two world lines in minkowski space .",
    "it is therefore possible to get an overview of all possible spacetime geometries very easily .",
    "however , there are also some problems with this simple construction .",
    "first of all , it does not work for masses bigger then @xmath6 , although such spacetimes do exist . in this case",
    ", the half planes defining the boundary of the wedges must be replaced by curved surfaces , as otherwise the wedges overlap .",
    "but this is actually not a serious problem .",
    "the more serious problem has to do with the asymptotic structure of the spacetime at infinity .",
    "the region far away from the particles is split into two segments in figure  [ wdg ] .",
    "each segment is a subset of minkowski space .",
    "but on the wedges we have to apply non - trivial transition functions , relating the minkowski coordinates on one side to those on the other side .",
    "to find out what the spacetime looks like at infinity , it would be nicer to have a single coordinate chart covering this region .",
    "there is in fact a particular reason why we are interested in the asymptotic structure of the kepler spacetime . in order to quantize it in the end",
    ", we first have to set up a proper classical hamiltonian formulation .",
    "this requires a proper definition of an action principle for the underlying field theory of einstein gravity . and",
    "this again requires some kind of asymptotical flatness condition to be imposed on the metric at infinity @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic structure of the kepler spacetime depends crucially on the relative motion of the particles . if they are moving slowly , then far away from the particles the spacetime is also conical .",
    "it looks almost like the gravitational field of a single particle , whose mass is equal to the sum of the two masses of the real particles .",
    "the rest frame of this _ fictitious _ particle can be identified with the _ centre of mass frame _ of the universe .",
    "if the particles are moving faster , the apparent mass of the fictitious particle has to be replaced by the total energy of the system .",
    "it also receives a spin , which represents the total angular momentum . but still , the universe looks like a cone at infinity , and this cone defines the centre of mass frame .",
    "something strange happens when the relative motion of the particles exceeds a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "the definition of a centre of mass frame then breaks down , and the asymptotic structure of the spacetime is no longer conical .",
    "even more peculiar , the spacetime then contains closed timelike curves @xcite . clearly , these are very interesting features of such a simple two particle spacetime .",
    "but for our purpose we have to exclude them , again because we want to set up a proper hamiltonian framework .",
    "this requires a well defined causal structure of the spacetime .",
    "otherwise the hamiltonian , or adm formulation can not be applied to general relativity .",
    "it requires the existence of a foliation of the spacetime by spacelike slices @xcite    in order to get rid of these problems , we have to go over from the simple construction of the kepler spacetime in figure  [ wdg ] , to a slightly more sophisticated one , which focuses more on the asymptotic structure of spacetime at infinity .",
    "the basic idea is , first to fix the asymptotic structure of the spacetime , and then insert the particles . in figure  [ wdg ] ,",
    "the sequence is the other way around .",
    "the world lines are inserted first , then the actual spacetime is constructed , and finally the asymptotic structure can be read off by looking at the region at infinity . the transition from this picture to an alternative description of the kepler spacetime , based on its asymptotic structure ,",
    "is explicitly carried out in @xcite .",
    "there we also give a comprehensive overview of all those spacetimes that admit the definition of a centre of mass frame .",
    "somewhat schematically , the alternative construction of a two particle spacetime is shown in figure  [ tip ] .",
    "one starts from a big cone , cuts off the tip , and identifies the cut lines , which are two geodesics , such that a conical surface with two tips arises .",
    "the three dimensional version of this construction yields the kepler spacetime , although the technical details are a little bit more involved .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that the original cone immediately defines the centre of mass frame of the universe , as seen by an observer at infinity , and independent of the way the particles are inserted .",
    "moreover , we will be able also introduce position and momentum coordinates of the particles , referring to the centre of mass frame defined by the big cone .    in this way",
    ", the kepler system can effectively be treated like a simple two particle system in a fixed three dimensional background spacetime , although the technical details are again slightly more involved .",
    "the phase space becomes a finite dimensional manifold , and the kinematical and dynamical properties of the kepler system are finally encoded in the usual way , in the symplectic structure , or the poisson bracket , and the hamiltonian .",
    "the phase space structure is very similar to a system of two special - relativistic point particles in a flat minkowski space , restricted to the centre of mass frame . and in fact , it is possible to take the limit @xmath7 , where the gravitational interaction is switched off , and then the kepler system reduces to this free particle system .",
    "the article is therefore organized as follows . in section",
    "[ free ] , we shall only study the free particle system .",
    "of course , there is nothing new about this to be learned , expect perhaps the relativistic definition of a centre of mass frame , which is in this form not a very common concept .",
    "it is actually a centre of energy frame , but we shall stick to the more familiar notion of a centre of mass . after imposing the appropriate restriction on the phase space , we shall go through the usual canonical programme . starting from the classical hamiltonian framework ,",
    "we perform a phase space reduction , derive and solve the classical equations of motion , and finally we quantize it , deriving the energy eigenstates and the spectra of certain interesting operators .",
    "the idea behind this preparation , using a well known and very simple toy model for our real toy model , is to keep the conceptual aspects apart from the technical aspects .",
    "the conceptual aspects are , for example , the definitions of the various phase spaces , the way the mass shell constraints are imposed , the principle idea of the phase space reduction , and finally also the quantization methods . at the classical level , the free particle system also provides a nice toy model for the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity within the adm framework .",
    "this is indicated in figure  [ rpp ] . at the quantum level",
    ", we are going to consider two alternative quantization methods , the schrdinger method applied to the reduced classical phase space , where all gauge symmetries are removed , and the dirac method applied to an extended phase space , where the dynamics of the system is defined by a generalized mass shell constraint .",
    "all these concepts can then be applied to the kepler system in the very same way .",
    "it is therefore useful first to explain them using a much simpler model .",
    "the more technical aspects are then the modifications that we have to make when the gravitational interaction is switched on .",
    "they are divided into a classical part in section  [ class ] , and a quantum part in section  [ quant ] . in the classical section",
    ", we shall first look at the kepler spacetime itself , in the way explained above and described in figure  [ tip ] . we shall mainly focus on a geometric point of view , without going into any technical details and proofs .",
    "all these details can be found in the previously mentioned and more comprehensive article @xcite .",
    "it includes , in particular , the precise transition from figure  [ wdg ] to the alternative description in figure  [ tip ] .    in a certain sense ,",
    "the kepler spacetime is a _ deformation _ of the free particle spacetime , with newton s constant being the deformation parameter . at any stage of the derivation we can always get back to the free particle system by taking the limit @xmath7",
    "this can be used as a cross check at various points , and sometimes it is even possible to set up general rules , telling us how to deform the free particle system to obtain the corresponding structures of the coupled system .",
    "this also applies to the phase space of the kepler system , which is the subject of the second part of section  [ class ] .",
    "it is a _ deformed _ version of the free particle phase space .",
    "the interesting point is thereby that gravity affects the symplectic structure of this phase space , and not only the hamiltonian , which is otherwise the typical feature of interactions between point particles .",
    "the actual derivation of the deformed symplectic structure will not be given in the article .",
    "we should however emphasize that this derivation is a very important point .",
    "we do not want to make any special or unmotivated assumptions .",
    "instead , the only assumption that enters the definition of the kepler system is the following .",
    "the kinematical and dynamical features of the gravitational field are completely defined by the einstein hilbert action .",
    "all the relevant phase space structures can then be derived from this action principle , by a straightforward phase space reduction .",
    "however , apart from the symplectic structure , all other features of the phase space can more or less be inferred from geometric considerations .",
    "we shall therefore restrict to these geometrical aspects here , and refer to @xcite for the derivation of the symplectic structure for a more general multi particle system .    in the last part of section  [ class ]",
    ", we will go through the whole canonical programme once again , deriving and solving the classical equations of motion , and briefly describing the various kinds of trajectories . at this point",
    ", we can actually forget about the general relativistic nature of the system , and treat it as if it was a simple two particle system living in a three dimensional background spacetime . or , if we do not want to give up the general relativistic point of view completely , we may at least stick to the adm picture , and consider the kepler system as a space which evolves in time .",
    "as shown in figure  [ emb ] , the phase space variables define the geometry of space at a moment of time , and this geometry changes with time . effectively , the particles are moving in a two dimensional space .",
    "we can also think of a typical scattering process , and define quantities like incoming and outgoing momenta , and scattering angles .    in the quantum section , we will first try to apply the same quantization methods that we also applied to the free particle system .",
    "we ll find that the straightforward schrdinger quantization fails , due to some peculiar features of the deformed classical phase space and its symplectic structure .",
    "this already indicates that there are some new effects to be expected , which are due to the gravitational interaction , and which are fundamentally different from other interactions .",
    "the dirac method however works .",
    "it is possible to set up a well defined operator representation , and to quantize and solve the constraint equation , which is a generalized klein gordon equation .",
    "a similar equation has also been found for a somewhat simpler single particle system @xcite .",
    "we can solve this constraint equation , and finally we are able to express the energy eigenstates of the kepler system explicitly as wave functions on a suitably defined configuration space .",
    "suitably thereby means that the wave function has the usual physical interpretation as a probability amplitude for the particles in space . or",
    ", once again , if we want to stick to the general relativistic point of view , it is a probability amplitude for certain geometries of space .",
    "we have in this sense a simple example for a truly quantized general relativistic system .",
    "the quantum state gives us probabilities for geometries .",
    "but nevertheless , it is somewhat more intuitive to consider the wave function as a probability amplitude in an ordinary space .",
    "the space is thereby the configuration space of the two particles in the centre of mass frame . and",
    "it is also useful to have in mind the usual picture of a scattering state in quantum mechanics .",
    "the energy eigenstates are parameterized by two quantum numbers .",
    "the inverse radial wavelength at infinity represents the eigenvalue of the incoming and outgoing momenta of the particles . and",
    "the inverse angular wavelength represents the eigenvalue of the angular momentum .",
    "the latter is quantized in steps of @xmath4 , and the radial momentum turns out to have a positive continuous spectrum .",
    "the energy , or the frequency of the wave function , only depends on the radial quantum number .",
    "so far , these are the typical features of scattering states in quantum mechanics . however , the energy spectrum is bounded from below and from above .",
    "this is actually not surprising , because the total energy contained in a three dimensional universe is bounded from above by @xmath8 , which corresponds to the maximal deficit angle @xmath9 of a conical spacetime .",
    "the lower bound for the total energy is the sum of the rest masses of the particles , which is also not surprising .",
    "what is remarkable , however , is that the radial momentum of the particles is nevertheless unbounded .",
    "for very large momenta of the particles , the total energy of the kepler system approaches the upper bound @xmath8 .",
    "this behaviour has also been found for a single particle , where the upper bound is half as big , thus @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the relation between the spatial momentum of the particles in the centre of mass frame , and the total energy of the system is shown in figure  [ dsp ] , where it is compared to the corresponding free particle energy .",
    "the energy of the kepler system is always smaller than the free particle energy .",
    "the difference is a kind of gravitational binding energy . at the quantum level , this has the strange consequence that the wavelength of the wave function in space can be arbitrarily small , but the frequency is bounded from above .    finally , we shall then look at the wave functions themselves .",
    "unfortunately , it is hardly possible to read off any physically interesting information directly from the analytic expressions .",
    "they are somewhat complicated , involving hypergeometric functions .",
    "we shall therefore look at the graphical representations of some typical wave functions .",
    "they are shown in the figures  [ wav0 ] through  [ wav3 ] , both for the free particles and the kepler system .",
    "we shall thereby find the following interesting features . at large distances ,",
    "the gravitational interaction has almost no effect .",
    "we have the typical scattering wave function , which is a superposition of an ingoing and an outgoing radial wave .",
    "the only difference between the free and the coupled system is a phase shift , which indicates that some interaction takes place when the particles are closer to each other .    at small distances however , which are of the order of the _ planck length _ @xmath10 , the wave function changes drastically .",
    "we typically find that the particles avoid to be at the same point in space .",
    "we even find that under certain very general circumstances , it is impossible for the particles to get closer to each other than a certain minimal distance .",
    "it is of the order of ten to hundred planck lengths , and depends on the rest masses of the particles and their statistics . in three spacetime dimensions ,",
    "there are not only bosons and fermions , but also _ anyons _ , and there is also a generalized statistics if the particles are not identical @xcite .",
    "all this can be taken into account very easily when the quantization is performed .",
    "the finite lower bound for the distance of the particles in space arises whenever the particles are not two bosons , and it is maximal for two identical fermions .",
    "referring again to the scattering picture , it is reasonable to say that due to this minimal distance , it is impossible to probe the structure of spacetime at small length scales , even if we increase the momentum of the particles unboundedly .",
    "this is exactly the kind of limit that quantum gravity is expected to impose on the ability to look at small length scales in spacetime .",
    "another feature of our toy model is closely related to this , but a little bit more general .",
    "even if the particles are further apart than the minimal distance , it is still impossible to localize them within a box that is smaller than a certain size .",
    "more precisely , it is impossible to find a quantum state where the relative position of the particles in space is arbitrarily sharp at a given moment of time , even if the distance between the particles is many orders of magnitude above the planck scale .",
    "both features indicate that the quantized spacetime in which the particles are living obtains a kind of foamy structure .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to derive a more explicit and intuitive _ spacetime spectrum _",
    ", like the one for the single particle system in @xcite .",
    "but in principle , we have a very similar situation , and this is also expected to arise in a more realistic , or even in a fully consistent theory of quantum gravity in higher dimensions .",
    "hence , although the kepler system is only a very simple toy model , some principle effects of quantum gravity can be seen .",
    "these are really quantum gravity effects , because they disappear not only at the classical level , hence in the limit @xmath11 , whatever this precisely means , but also in the well defined limit @xmath7 , where the gravitational interaction is switched off .",
    "finally , a nice feature of this toy model is that , once the reduction to a two particle system in three dimensions is accepted , everything else can be derived exactly and without any further assumptions .",
    "it is possible to keep the assumptions and simplifications clearly apart from the mathematics and the physical conclusions .",
    "there are no hidden points were additional , say , intuitive assumptions must made .",
    "the _ only _ assumption that enters the definition of the kepler system as a toy model is the einstein hilbert action with the appropriate matter terms for the particles , which is assumed to define the dynamics of the gravitational field .",
    "this is the concept on which the derivation of a general multi particle phase space is based in @xcite .",
    "the point where this assumption enters this article , is the definition of the symplectic structure in section  [ class ] .",
    "before we switch on the gravitational interaction , let us consider a system of two uncoupled relativistic point particles @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) in flat , three dimensional minkowski space . as a vector space",
    ", we identify this with the spinor representation @xmath14 of the three dimensional lorentz algebra .",
    "the twelve dimensional _ kinematical _ phase space is spanned by the positions @xmath15 and the momentum vectors @xmath16 of the particles , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is an orthonormal basis given by the usual gamma matrices ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "further conventions and some useful formulas regarding the vector and matrix notation are given in the appendix .",
    "we have the usual symplectic potential @xmath19 , from which we read off the poisson brackets , @xmath20 the hamiltonian @xmath21 is a linear combination of the two mass shell constraints @xmath22 , with lagrange multipliers @xmath23 as coefficients , @xmath24 the _ physical _ phase space is a subset of the kinematical phase space , which is defined by the mass shell constraints and the positive energy conditions , @xmath25 the world lines are parameterized by a common , unphysical time coordinate @xmath26 , and the hamiltonian generates the time evolution with respect to this coordinate , @xmath27 the freedom to choose the multipliers @xmath28 corresponds to the gauge freedom to reparameterize the world lines .",
    "finally , there are some conserved charges which are of interest , namely the total momentum vector and the total angular momentum vector , @xmath29 } .\\ ] ] the associated rigid symmetries are the translations and lorentz rotations of the world lines with respect to the _ reference frame _ , which is defined by the coordinates of the embedding minkowski space .",
    "so far , this is the standard hamiltonian formulation of a special - relativistic two particle system .",
    "since we are only interested in the relative motion of the particles , we shall now impose some further restrictions on the phase space variables .",
    "provided that the total momentum vector is positive timelike , there always exists a reference frame where @xmath30 we call this the _ centre of mass _ frame .",
    "there is only one special situation where a centre of mass frame does not exist .",
    "if both particles are massless and if they move with the velocity of light into the same direction , then the total momentum is lightlike .",
    "these special states are excluded in the following .    in the centre of mass frame ,",
    "the rigid symmetries are reduced to a two dimensional group of time translations and spatial rotations about the @xmath31-axis .",
    "the associated charges are the total energy @xmath32 and the spatial angular momentum @xmath33 .",
    "it is also allowed to speak about an absolute time , defined by the @xmath31-axis , and an absolute space orthogonal to it , defined by the @xmath34-axes in minkowski space .",
    "essentially , we have a non - relativistic system , although the dynamical properties of the particles are still relativistic .",
    "we can use this to impose a gauge condition , which restricts the way the world lines are parameterized .",
    "it is reasonable to choose the parameterization such that @xmath35 at each moment of time @xmath26 , the particles are then located on the same equal time plane , as indicated in figure  [ rpp ] .",
    "we can think of an adm like foliation of the embedding minkowski space by equal time planes .",
    "the planes are labeled by an adm time coordinate @xmath26 , and each plane represents an instant of time in the centre of mass frame . for the moment",
    ", we do not require the adm time @xmath26 to be related in any way to the absolute time in the centre of mass frame .",
    "hence , there is still one gauge degrees of freedom left , which is compactible with the gauge condition ( [ rpp - eqt ] ) .",
    "this is a simultaneous reparameterization of both world lines .",
    "[ rpp ] .    from the phase space point of view",
    ", the various restrictions can be regarded as additional constraints .",
    "all together , we have seven constraints . the two mass shell constraints ( [ rpp - mss ] ) , the gauge condition ( [ rpp - eqt ] ) , and four independent spatial components of the definition ( [ rpp - com ] ) of the center of mass frame .",
    "note that the time components of these equations are definitions of the phase space functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "since we have an odd number of constraints , it is clear that at least one of them is a first class constraint , which generates the simultaneous time evolution of the two particles as a gauge symmetry .",
    "the other six are second class constraints , as we are now going to show .    to easiest way to do this is to eliminate six of the seven constraints , and to show that the reduced symplectic structure is still non - degenerate .",
    "we do this by introducing new phase space variables , which are similar to the usual non - relativistic centre of mass coordinates and momenta of a two particle system .",
    "the general solution to the equation @xmath36 can obviously be written as @xmath37 the new variables @xmath38 are the energies of the particles , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are polar coordinates defining the spatial momentum and its direction .",
    "the rotating unit vector @xmath41 is introduced in ( [ gamma - rot ] ) .",
    "it defines the angular direction @xmath40 in minkowski space , thus in this case the direction of motion of the particles in the centre of mass frame .    to express the mass shell constraints in terms of these variables",
    ", it is convenient to replace the mass parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 by a total mass @xmath44 and a relative mass @xmath45 , @xmath46 without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath47 .",
    "the special cases are @xmath48 , where both particles have the same mass , and @xmath49 , where at least one particle is massless .",
    "the same redefinition can be applied to the energy variables , @xmath50 where the inequality represents the positive energy condition for both particles .",
    "the mass shell constraints ( [ rpp - ham ] ) are then given by @xmath51 they can be simplified by taking the following linear combinations , @xmath52 let us solve the constraint @xmath53 for @xmath54 , so that @xmath54 becomes a simple function of @xmath32 , @xmath55 what remains is a single mass shell constraint , which can be written as @xmath56 we ll see later one that this is just a somewhat unusual way to write the familiar relation between the momentum and the energy of two relativistic point particles .",
    "the positive energy condition becomes a non - trivial condition to be imposed on @xmath32 , namely @xmath57 note that this implies @xmath58 , so that the various places where @xmath32 appears in the denominator are not problematic .",
    "all together , the momentum vectors are parameterized by three independent variables @xmath32 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "they have an immediate physical interpretation as the total energy , the spatial momentum , and the direction of motion of the particles in the centre of mass frame .",
    "the positions @xmath59 are subject to the constraints @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    ". the general solution can be parameterized by three other variables @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , so that @xmath65 the radial coordinate @xmath66 represents the relative position of the particles in space , and @xmath64 is the spatial orientation .",
    "it is also useful to introduce the relative position vector @xmath67 , which is going to have a generalization for the interacting particles later on .",
    "the _ clock _",
    "@xmath62 represents the absolute time in the centre of mass frame .",
    "it is the @xmath31-coordinate of the equal time plane in figure  [ rpp ] .",
    "so far , it is an arbitrary function of the adm time @xmath26 , because we are still free to choose the parameterization of the world lines , and thus the labeling of the equal time planes by the unphysical coordinate @xmath26 .    using all this",
    ", we can solve the equation @xmath60 , and express the result in terms of the new phase space variables , @xmath68 the relativistic version of the centre of mass frame is thus actually a centre of energy frame . at each moment of time , the centre of energy is located on the @xmath31-axis in figure  [ rpp ] . but",
    "nevertheless , let us stick to the notion centre of mass frame .",
    "the crucial point is that the positions of the particles are , like the momenta , specified by three independent variables .",
    "we have the clock @xmath62 , the relative position @xmath63 , and the orientation @xmath64 .    to see that the six eliminated constraints were second class constraints , we have to compute the reduced symplectic potential",
    ". inserting ( [ rpp - mom - mvk ] ) and ( [ rpp - pos - xt ] ) into ( [ rpp - pot - pois ] ) gives @xmath69 to simplify this , we replace the polar momentum coordinates @xmath39 and @xmath40 by cartesian coordinates @xmath70 they define the _ radial _ and _ angular _ momentum .",
    "one can easily verify that @xmath33 indeed satisfies @xmath60 , so it coincides with the previous definition .",
    "moreover , inserting this into ( [ rpp - mom - mvk ] ) gives @xmath71 this tells us that @xmath72 is the component of the momentum parallel to the relative position , and @xmath73 is the component orthogonal to it .",
    "this is the usual definition of a radial and angular momentum .",
    "if we use @xmath74 and @xmath33 as the basic phase space variables , then the expression to be inserted into the mass shell constraint ( [ rpp - ef ] ) is @xmath75 and finally , the symplectic potential simplifies to @xmath76 this defines a non - degenerate symplectic structure @xmath77 , and we read off the following non - vanishing poisson brackets , @xmath78 from this it is immediately obvious that @xmath32 is the charge associated with time translations @xmath79 , and @xmath33 is the charge associated with spatial rotations @xmath80 .",
    "what remains from the hamiltonian is a single mass shell constraint @xmath81 , and a multiplier @xmath82 , which is some not further interesting linear combination of the original multipliers @xmath28 , @xmath83 it is still an unphysical hamiltonian .",
    "its value is zero for physical states , and it generates the time evolution with respect to the unphysical adm time @xmath26 , which is formally a gauge transformation . except for the reduced symmetry group , this looks very much like the hamiltonian description of a single relativistic point particle .",

    "it is this feature that we are going to exploit in the following , treating the two particle system in the centre of mass frame as if it was a single particle system .",
    "of course , this is a well know way to solve a two particle system in non - relativistic mechanics , and we ll see that it also works for this almost trivial relativistic system",
    ".      we can also go over to an effectively non - relativistic formulation , where no constraint and no gauge symmetry is left .",
    "we just have to impose another gauge condition .",
    "the most natural one is to require the adm time @xmath26 to coincide with the absolute time @xmath62 in the centre of mass frame .",
    "this provides another constraint , and together with the mass shell constraint we get a new pair of second class constraints , @xmath85 let us assume that the function @xmath86 can be inverted .",
    "we can then define a four dimensional _ reduced _ phase space @xmath87 it is just the usual non - relativistic phase space of the relative motion of two particles in a plane . to derive the symplectic structure and the hamiltonian on @xmath88 , we have to take into account that the constraints ( [ rpp - gauge - con ] ) are explicitly time dependent .",
    "this implies a mixing of the hamiltonian and the symplectic structure when we perform the reduction .",
    "we have to consider the extended symplectic potential on @xmath89 , @xmath90 to obtain the reduced structures on @xmath88 , we insert the solutions to the equations @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and write the result as a combination of the reduced symplectic potential @xmath93 and the reduced hamiltonian @xmath94 , @xmath95 note that the last term in ( [ rpp - epot - ext ] ) vanishes , because the constraint @xmath96 is now identically satisfied .",
    "what comes out is @xmath97 the poisson brackets of the remaining variables are unchanged , and they are the usual non - relativistic ones .",

    "nevertheless , the scattering picture is quite useful .",
    "there will by a real scattering when the gravitational interaction is switched on .",
    "the constant of motion @xmath148 has a useful interpretation in this picture .",

    "more precisely , consider the pair of canonically conjugate variables @xmath149 replacing @xmath74 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath150 also represents the distance between the particles in space , but @xmath151 is now the momentum which is canonically conjugate to it , in contrast to @xmath74 which is not exactly conjugate . for the trajectories derived above , we have @xmath152 in the limit @xmath153 , or equivalently @xmath154 , we have @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",

    "the eigenvalue of @xmath39 is then the inverse radial wavelength of the wave function at spatial infinity . at the classical level , @xmath119 is the momentum of the incoming and outgoing particles in the scattering process .",
    "a special situation arises when @xmath157 .",
    "then , according to ( [ rpp - orb - con ] ) , we have either @xmath129 or @xmath158 . the first case",

    "of course , such a trajectory only exists when both particles are massive , as otherwise we must have @xmath123 , because massless particles can not be at rest .",
    "the more interesting case is @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath123 .",
    "the argument of the @xmath164 is then ill defined .",
    "but we can still consider the trajectory as a limit . in the limit @xmath165 and @xmath166 , with @xmath119 and all other integration constants fixed ,",
    "we get @xmath167 the crucial point is now that the limit still depends on @xmath168 , thus on the direction of the limit .",
    "but if we change the definition of the integration constants slightly , we may also write @xmath169 where the sign no longer matters . clearly , this is just the definition of a straight line through the origin of the polar coordinate system .",
    "the particles approach each other from a direction @xmath145 , touch each other at @xmath170 without interaction , and separate again into the opposite direction @xmath146 .",

    "let us now , finally , perform the quantization of the free particle system .",
    "the most straightforward way is to start from the reduced classical phase space @xmath171 with symplectic potential ( [ rpp - pot - red ] ) , @xmath172 this is an unconstrained formulation .",

    "the parameter @xmath181 is some fixed real number .",
    "it represents a quantization ambiguity that typically arises when the classical phase space is not simply connected @xcite .",
    "a special case occurs when the two particles have the same mass .",
    "they can then be regarded as identical , and replacing @xmath175 with @xmath182 already takes us back to the same state . in this case",
    ", we have the stronger relation @xmath183 and the parameter @xmath181 defines the statistics of the particles . if @xmath181 is an even integer , then the particles are called _ bosons _ , and for odd integers they are called _",

    "there is no spin statistics theorem for this simple toy model .    for non - integer values of @xmath181 , the particles are usually called _ anyons _",
    "anyons can only arise in three spacetime dimensions . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the fundamental group of the phase space of two identical particles is @xmath184 rather than @xmath185 , which implies that @xmath181 has to be an integer , which is even for bosons and odd for fermions .",
    "another special feature in three spacetime dimensions is that the non - trivial phase factor in ( [ rpp - stat ] ) also shows up when the particles are not identical . slightly abusing the language",

    "we should also note that the operators for @xmath74 and @xmath33 are uniquely defined by the commutation relation , up to redefinitions that can be compensated either by a phase transformation of the wave function , or by redefining the periodicity condition ( [ rpp - stat ] ) .",
    "in other words , the statistics parameter @xmath181 is the only relevant quantization ambiguity .    to derive the energy eigenstates let us first consider the operator  @xmath190 , of which the hamiltonian @xmath191 is a function .",
    "we choose the hermitian ordering @xmath192 in the representation  ( [ rpp - sch - qs ] ) , @xmath190 is then proportional to the usual laplacian in the polar coordinates , @xmath193 to make @xmath190 self - adjoint , a boundary condition at @xmath179 is needed .",
    "following @xcite , we choose this condition so that the wave function remains finite at @xmath179 .",
    "the normalized eigenfunctions are then parametrised by two quantum numbers , @xmath194  and  @xmath195 , and given by the bessel functions of the first kind , @xmath196 they are normalized so that @xmath197 as expected , the quantum number @xmath194 is the inverse radial wavelength of the wave function at infinity .",
    "we already expected the eigenvalues of @xmath39 to have this property , because for large distances of the particles the momentum @xmath39 is equal to the canonical radial momentum @xmath198 .",

    "it fulfills the same periodicity condition as the wave functions , hence ( [ rpp - stat ] ) or ( [ rpp - stat - id ] ) , depending on whether the particles are identical or not .",
    "the momentum eigenstates @xmath206 are also the energy eigenstates .",

    "the schrdinger quantization of the free particles system is completely straightforward and gives the expected result .",
    "there is not much more to be said about this very simple dynamical system .",

    "the states which are annihilated by the operator @xmath218 and satisfy the positive energy condition @xmath219 are those where the quantum numbers are related by the dispersion relation @xmath223 .",
    "a general physical state is given by @xmath224 where @xmath211 is again the wave function in momentum space .",
    "it is useful to split off a radial wave function and write the result as @xmath225 where @xmath226 we shall later compare this radial wave function to that of the kepler system , and from this we will be able to read off the basic effects of quantum gravity in this toy model .",
    "formally , the physical wave functions ( [ rpp - dir - wave ] ) in the dirac approach are exactly the same as ( [ rpp - sch - wave ] ) in the schrdinger approach .",
    "there is only the following conceptual difference .",
    "the wave function in the dirac approach is not a solution to the time dependent schrdinger equation , but a solution to a generalized klein gordon equation , thus a constraint equation . in the schrdinger formulation ,",
    "the wave function depends by definition on the physical time @xmath26 , whereas in the dirac formulation , the time dependence is encoded implicitly in the dependence of the wave function on the eigenvalue @xmath215 of the clock , which is one of the classical phase space variables .    in the dirac approach , there is no time evolution of the state with respect to the adm time @xmath26 , because this is an unphysical coordinate .",
    "the hamiltonian annihilates all physical states , and the schrdinger equation is void . to say something about the physical time evolution in the dirac quantization",
    ", we have to refer to an operator that represents a clock .",
    "the free particle system is in this context a nice toy model to explain how the problem of time arises in quantum gravity , and how it can be solved by considering operators representing physical clocks @xcite .",
    "now we are going to switch on the gravitational interaction .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , we shall first consider an alternative way to construct the kepler spacetime , which includes the definition of a centre of mass frame , based on the asymptotic structure of the spacetime far away from the particles .",
    "we shall thereby focus on the geometrical aspects , and skip all technical details and proofs .",
    "they can be found in @xcite .",
    "we shall then introduce a set of phase space variables .",
    "they provide position and momentum coordinates , similar to those of the free particles .",
    "but at the same time they also specify the geometry of space at a moment of time , thus providing the of adm variables of general relativity .    on the phase space spanned by these variables",
    ", we can then introduce a hamiltonian and a symplectic potential .",
    "the former can be inferred from some straightforward geometric considerations .",
    "the latter can only be derived from the full theory of einstein gravity as a field theory .",
    "as this is not part of this article , we can here only refer to the general derivation of the phase space structures for a multi particle model in @xcite . on the given phase space",
    ", we can then derive and solve the equations of motion , and finally we shall briefly discuss the various trajectories and compare them to the free particle trajectories .",
    "to explain the definition of the centre of mass frame , and to show how the phase space variables of the kepler system specify the geometry of space , it is useful first to consider a simplified example",
    ". let us assume that the particles are at rest with respect to each other , so that the spacetime is static .",
    "it is then possible to introduce a globally defined absolute time coordinate @xmath227 , and the spacetime can be foliated by the surfaces of constant @xmath228 . in the following , a letter with a tilde always denotes a coordinate on the spacetime , whereas all other symbols are configuration or phase space variables , or functions thereof .    in the static spacetime ,",
    "the surface @xmath228 represents an instant of time , like the equal time planes for the free particle system in figure  [ rpp ] .",
    "all slices have the same geometry , and the spacetime is just the direct product of a fixed space with a real line .",
    "the einstein equations require this space to be locally flat , and there must be two conical singularities , representing the particles .",
    "in other words , the space is a conical surface with two tips . we denote them by @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "the deficit angles at the tips are equal to @xmath229 .",
    "what we would like to find is a suitable set of configuration variables , describing the geometry of such a surface .",
    "and we are also looking for an appropriate definition of a centre of mass frame .",
    "[ tip ]    for this purpose , we embed the conical surface in a special way into a euclidean plane , as shown in figure  [ tip ] .",
    "the first step is to introduce a geodesic @xmath181 , which connects the two tips @xmath230 and @xmath231 on the conical surface .",
    "there is always a unique such geodesic , because apart from the two tips there is no curvature . when the conical space is cut along the line @xmath181 , it becomes a surface with a hole in the middle .",
    "the points @xmath12 are located on a circular boundary . as shown in figure  [ tip](a ) , the resulting surface is a subset of an ordinary cone , with a certain region around the tip taken away .",
    "the total deficit angle of the big cone is the sum of the deficit angles at the tips @xmath12 , thus @xmath232 .",
    "let us introduce on the big cone a polar coordinate system @xmath233 , so that @xmath234 defines the radial distance from the tip , and @xmath235 is an angular coordinate with a period of @xmath9 .",
    "including the absolute time @xmath227 as a third coordinate , the spacetime metric can be written as @xmath236 this defines a static cone with a total deficit angle of @xmath237 .",
    "the conical surface in figure  [ tip](a ) becomes a surface of constant @xmath228 in this spacetime .",
    "roughly speaking , we can say that the static kepler spacetime is a cone with a tip cut off , and with the cut lines identified .    from the physical point of view",
    ", the situation is as follows .",
    "far away from the particles , say at spatial infinity , the spacetime looks like the gravitational field of a single particle with mass @xmath238 .",
    "it is reasonable to identify the rest frame of this _ fictitious _ particle with the centre of mass frame of the universe .",
    "the centre of mass frame is thus defined by a certain property of the spacetime metric at spatial infinity , which does not directly refer to the particles .",
    "it is a kind of asymptotical flatness , which is explicitly defined in terms of the _ conical coordinates _ @xmath239 .",
    "the fictitious tip of the big cone in figure  [ tip](a ) is the apparent location of the centre of mass , as seen by an observer at infinity .",
    "in analogy to the free particle system , let us identify the centre of mass frame with the reference frame of such an external observer .",
    "with respect to this reference frame , we define the _ absolute _ positions of the particles in spacetime as the conical coordinates @xmath240 of the points @xmath12 on the big cone . again in analogy to the free particles , these absolute coordinates are not independent .",
    "they are specified by three independent _ relative _ coordinates .",
    "at each moment of time , both points @xmath12 are located on the same surface of constant @xmath228 .",
    "moreover , for the cut line @xmath181 to be of the same length on both sides of the big cone , the points @xmath12 must be located on two opposite , or antipodal radial lines . hence , we must have @xmath241 the variables @xmath62 and @xmath64 are straightforward generalizations of the corresponding free particle variables .",
    "the former defines a clock , the latter represents the angular orientation of the particles with respect to the reference frame . as a third independent coordinate , we introduce the distance @xmath150 between the particles .",
    "it is the length of the geodesic @xmath181 .",
    "it is a simple exercise in conical geometry to compute this .",
    "the result can be expressed as a function of the conical radial coordinates @xmath242 and the total deficit angle , @xmath243 finally , there is one more consistency condition .",
    "the deficit angles at the points @xmath12 must be equal to @xmath229 .",
    "so far we have only fixed the total deficit angle of the big cone , which is the sum of the two individual deficit angles .",
    "we still have to fix the way this deficit angle is distributed over the two tips .",
    "this yields another relation between the radial coordinates @xmath242 .",
    "it is again a simple exercise in conical geometry to show that @xmath244 so , what is the conclusion ?",
    "there are obvious three independent variables @xmath62 , @xmath150 , and @xmath64 .",
    "they define the geometry of the space manifold at a moment of time , and the way this space manifold is embedded into the spacetime manifold . in this sense",
    ", they provide some kind of discretized adm variables of general relativity . on the other hand , from the particle point of view ,",
    "the same variables define the relative position of the particles with respect to each other , as well as their absolute positions with respect to the centre of mass frame .",
    "the definition of the relative coordinates is very similar to ( [ rpp - t - dis ] ) for the free particles .",
    "we can not say anything about the momentum variables at this point , because we are only considering the static states . we still have to generalize these concepts for moving particle .",
    "but let us stick to the static case for a moment , and let us introduce a slightly different representation of the same conical geometry of space .",
    "let us not only cut the space manifold along the geodesic @xmath181 , but also along two antipodal radial lines @xmath245 , extending from the points @xmath12 to infinity .",
    "hence , @xmath245 is a line of constant @xmath246 and @xmath247 in the big cone , which lies inside the surface of constant conical time @xmath228 .",
    "the conical surface is then divided symmetrically into two _ half spaces _ , which we denote by @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "each half space @xmath250 is bounded by three edges , denoted by @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 , and it has two corners , called @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "the two half spaces are flat and simply connected . they can be embedded into a euclidean plane in the following unique way , which is shown in figure  [ tip](b ) .",
    "the apparent position of the fictitious centre of mass , hence the tip of the big cone , is mapped onto the origin of the plane . moreover ,",
    "the edges @xmath252 are mapped onto two parallel straight lines , with angular direction @xmath64 .",
    "this fixes the embedding of the half spaces into the plane completely .    to describe the embedding more explicitly , it is convenient to think of the euclidean plane as an equal time plane in minkowski space .",
    "we choose it to be the plane with @xmath31-coordinate @xmath62 .",
    "the geometry of the two half spaces can then be specified as follows .",
    "the edges @xmath252 are represented by two spacelike minkowski vectors @xmath256 .",
    "they are given by @xmath257 the end points of the edges @xmath252 are the corners @xmath258 .",
    "they are located at the following points in minkowski space , @xmath259 where the coordinates @xmath242 given by ( [ static - cr ] ) .",
    "one can easily verify that this implies @xmath260 . and finally , the edges @xmath261 are radial lines , extending from the corners @xmath258 to infinity .",
    "a radial line in minkowski space is a geodesic which is orthogonal to the @xmath31-axis , and intersects with it if it is extended beyond its end point .",
    "the advantage of figure  [ tip](b ) is that it uses less dimensions to visualize the conical geometry of space .",
    "in contrast to figure  [ tip](a ) , we do not need an auxiliary third euclidean dimension to embed the big cone .",
    "this will be useful when we now consider the moving particles , because then the space is no longer flat .",
    "we can also read off the deficit angles of the particles directly from figure  [ tip](b ) .",
    "the deficit angle of the particle @xmath230 is the angle between the edges @xmath262 and @xmath263 in the plane . according to ( [ static - pos ] ) , this angle is equal to @xmath264 .",
    "the deficit angle of the particle @xmath231 is the angle between the edges @xmath265 and @xmath266 on the other side , which is equal to @xmath267 .",
    "the disadvantage of figure  [ tip](b ) is that the definition of the centre of mass frame is less obvious .",
    "however , it is actually only the relation between the geometry of space and the centre of mass frame , which we need in the following . and this can still be read off from figure  [ tip](b ) .",
    "first , we need to know which time slice is represented by the given space .",
    "this is specified by the clock @xmath62 , and according to ( [ static - pos ] ) this is also the @xmath31-coordinate of the plane shown figure  [ tip](b ) . and secondly , we need to know the spatial orientation of the particles with respect to the reference frame .",
    "this is specified by the symmetry axis of figure  [ tip](b ) .",
    "it is the solid line in the middle , which is a radial line with angular direction @xmath268 .",
    "when the particles are moving , we have to generalize two aspects of this construction .",
    "the geometry of space is no longer constant in time .",
    "the previously introduced relative position coordinates become time dependent , and we also have to introduce conjugate momentum variables .",
    "the time evolution will finally be provided by some hamiltonian , which we still have to derive .",
    "moreover , we also have to replace the conical metric ( [ static - cone ] ) of the big cone by a more general conical geometry .",
    "let us first consider this second aspect .",
    "if the particles are in motion with respect to each other , then the fictitious centre of mass particle receives a variable mass @xmath32 and a variable spin @xmath33 , where @xmath32 is the total energy and @xmath33 is the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "the gravitational field of such a particle is a _ spinning cone _",
    "@xcite . using the same conical coordinates as before",
    ", the metric of a spinning cone can be written as @xmath269 this is obviously a generalized version of ( [ static - cone ] ) .",
    "the previously considered static case is recovered if we set @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "but nevertheless , we can still use the conical coordinates @xmath239 to define the centre of mass frame of the universe , and we may also identify this with the reference frame of some external observer sitting at infinity .    to visualize the geometry of the spinning cone ,",
    "let us consider a surface of constant conical time @xmath228 .",
    "we can still say that each such surface represents an instant of time in the centre of mass frame . moreover , all such surfaces have the same geometry , as long as we do not insert the moving particles .",
    "the spinning cone is no longer static , but still stationary .",
    "a surface of constant conical time is not flat , but it can locally be embedded into minkowski space .",
    "the following local isometry maps a segment of the spinning cone into minkowski space .",
    "we fix some angular direction @xmath133 and define @xmath272 one can easily check that this is indeed an isometry .",
    "it is only a local isometry , because it does not respect the periodicity of @xmath235 .",
    "a surface of constant @xmath228 of the spinning cone is mapped onto a _",
    "screw surface _ in minkowski space .",
    "a screw surface in minkowski space is defined by a family radial lines , where the @xmath31-coordinate increases linearly with the angular direction .",
    "the slope of this screw surface is determined by the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "if we pass once around the spinning cone , thus if we increase @xmath235 by @xmath9 , then the total angle covered by the screw surface in minkowski space is @xmath273 , and the amount that we move forward in time is @xmath274 .",
    "the spinning cone has a _ deficit angle _ of @xmath275 and a _ time offset _ of @xmath276 . in units where the velocity of light is one ,",
    "the latter is a length or time if @xmath33 has the dimension of an angular momentum .",
    "the central axis of the spinning cone at @xmath277 is mapped onto the @xmath31-axis in minkowski space .",
    "this is the apparent world line of the centre of mass , as seen by an observer at infinity .",
    "there is a critical radius @xmath278 . for @xmath279 ,",
    "the screw surface is timelike , at @xmath280 it is lightlike , and for @xmath281 it is spacelike .",
    "there are thus closed timelike curves in the spinning cone , passing through the region @xmath279 .",
    "when we insert the particles , this critical region will be cut away , so that the actual kepler spacetime has no closed timelike curves . outside the critical region the causal structure of the spinning cone is well defined .",
    "to insert the particles , we have to generalize the construction in figure  [ tip](b ) .",
    "remember that the plane in which this construction took place was an equal time plane in minkowski space , with @xmath31-coordinate @xmath62 . and remember also that the symmetry axis was a radial line in this plane , with angular direction @xmath268 .",
    "we shall now _ lift _ this picture into the third dimension .",
    "the half spaces @xmath250 are tilted in a certain way , while the symmetry of the figure is preserved .",
    "the deformation is so that finally the half spaces become two segments of the previously considered screw surface .",
    "hence , they fit into the spinning cone as a surface of constant conical time @xmath228 .",
    "[ emb ]    as indicated in figure  [ emb ] , the deformation is as follows .",
    "the corners @xmath258 are raised and lowered symmetrically by @xmath282 .",
    "moreover , the mass parameters @xmath283 appearing in ( [ static - pos ] ) , which define the deficit angles of the particles , are replaced by two independent _ energy _",
    "variables @xmath38 .",
    "this is because for a moving particle the deficit angle is actually not proportional to its mass , but proportional to its energy @xcite .",
    "we shall look at this more closely in a moment . as we want the symmetry axis of the figure to be preserved , the locations of the corners @xmath258",
    "are then given by @xmath284 the radial coordinates @xmath242 are still to be determined .",
    "we recover the static case ( [ static - pos ] ) if we set @xmath285 and @xmath271 .",
    "the edges @xmath261 are still defined as the unique radial lines in minkowski space which pass through the corners @xmath258 . as they are now located at different time levels in the embedding minkowski space",
    ", each half space becomes a segment of a screw surface .",
    "the time offset of each half space is @xmath286 , and the angle in minkowski space covered by each half space is @xmath287 , where @xmath288 .",
    "let us glue the two half spaces together along the edges @xmath261 .",
    "the result is a screw surface with a deficit angle of @xmath275 and a time offset of @xmath274 .",
    "we can still use figure  [ tip](a ) as a schematic representation of this surface .",
    "it is a conical surface with a hole in the middle or , roughly speaking , a cone with the tip cut off .",
    "it can be embedded into a spinning cone , as a surface of constant conical time @xmath228 .",
    "thus it represents an instant of time in the centre of mass frame , and the clock @xmath62 represents the absolute time .",
    "the angular orientation of this embedding is fixed in the same way as before .",
    "the geodesics @xmath245 are two antipodal radial lines with conical coordinates @xmath246 and @xmath247 , where @xmath289 the edges @xmath252 are the geodesics in minkowski space , connecting the corners @xmath258 .",
    "as these are in general not contained in the screw surfaces , we actually have to deform the half spaces slightly in the neighbourhood of these edges .",
    "but this does not affect the embedding into the spinning cone .",
    "we can still assign two minkowski vectors @xmath256 to the edges @xmath252",
    ". they must be spacelike for the half spaces to be spacelike surfaces . and",
    "they can still be chosen so that both have the same direction @xmath64 , parallel to the symmetry axis . moreover , we already know that the @xmath31-components of these vectors must be equal to the time offsets @xmath286 of the two half spaces .",
    "hence , we have @xmath290 where @xmath150 is again the distance between the particles . on the other hand , also have @xmath260 , which implies that the radial coordinates @xmath242 are given by the following generalization of ( [ static - cr ] ) , @xmath291 so , after this somewhat technical construction , what did we get ?",
    "there are now six independent configuration variables @xmath292 , @xmath293 , @xmath33 , @xmath62 , @xmath150 , and @xmath64 . from the point of view of general relativity , they specify the geometry of space at a moment of time , providing a kind of discretized adm variables . from the particle point of view , they define both the relative position of the particles with respect to each other , as well as their absolute positions with respect to the centre of mass frame .",
    "the relative position of the particles is specified by the geodesic distance @xmath150 and the angular orientation @xmath64 .",
    "the absolute positions are given by the conical coordinates @xmath240 of the points @xmath12 in the spinning cone .",
    "all this is analogous to the previously considered static case , and also to the free particles , where the relative coordinates are @xmath63 ( or @xmath150 ) and @xmath64 , and the absolute positions are given by ( [ rpp - pos - xt ] ) .",
    "what makes the definitions a little bit more complicated here is that the reference frame is a conical frame , and not a minkowski frame .",
    "what we do not see so far is in which sense the energy and momentum variables are conjugate to the position coordinates , how they evolve in time , and what is also still missing is a variable that replaces the radial momentum @xmath74 .",
    "let us have a closer look at the way the edges in figure  [ emb ] are glued together .",
    "the embedding minkowski space can locally be identified with the spacetime manifold , if the world lines are excluded .",
    "more precisely , it provides an atlas of the spacetime manifold in the neighbourhood of the embedded space manifold at the given moment of time .",
    "the atlas consists of two charts , and each chart contains one half space as a spacelike surface .",
    "there are three overlap regions between the two charts , corresponding to the edges @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 .",
    "the transition functions in these overlap regions are isometries of the embedding minkowski space , hence poincar transformations .",
    "since in the following only the rotational components are of interest , let us ignore the translations that are involved .",
    "we can then say that the edge @xmath263 is mapped onto the edge @xmath262 by a certain lorentz rotation .",
    "it can be represented by an element @xmath294 of the spinor representation of the three dimensional lorentz group .",
    "similarly , the edge @xmath265 is also mapped onto the edge @xmath266 by some lorentz rotation , which is given by @xmath295 . and finally , @xmath296 is mapped onto @xmath297 by yet another lorentz rotation @xmath298 .",
    "the transition functions tell us how the half spaces are to be glued together along the edges .",
    "the question is thus , are they already determined by the variables introduced so far , or is there still some ambiguity ?",
    "consider first the edges @xmath263 and @xmath262 , on the right hand side of figure  [ emb ] .",
    "they are obviously mapped onto each other by a rotation about the @xmath31-axis by @xmath299 in clockwise direction .",
    "similarly , @xmath265 is mapped onto @xmath266 by a rotation about the @xmath31-axis by @xmath300 in counter clockwise direction .",
    "it is shown in the appendix that the group elements representing these rotations are @xmath301 to be precise , there are more general lorentz rotations mapping the given edges onto each other .",
    "we may , for example , multiply @xmath302 from the left with a boost whose axis is parallel to the edge @xmath263 , or from the right with boost whose axis is parallel to the edge @xmath262 .",
    "however , there is yet another consistency condition .",
    "the two half spaces have to fit together as two halves of a single screw surface , without a kink , and this is only the case if the transition functions are pure rotations .",
    "regarding the transition function @xmath303 , which specifies how the edges @xmath297 and @xmath296 are glued together , there is no such additional restriction .",
    "the only consistency condition is that the lorentz rotation @xmath303 maps the minkowski vector @xmath304 onto the vector @xmath305 , hence @xmath306 there is a one parameter family of such group elements , and therefore there is one additional degree of freedom that has to be fixed . as an ansatz ,",
    "we expand the matrix @xmath303 in terms of the unit and gamma matrices , using @xmath31 , @xmath268 and @xmath307 as an orthonormal basis , @xmath308 this basis is adapted to the definition ( [ dis - cone ] ) of the vectors @xmath256 , so that the equations ( [ dis - chol ] ) for the coefficients @xmath309 become as simple as possible . additionally , we have the equation @xmath310 .",
    "the resulting system of quadratic equations can be easily solved .",
    "there is a one - parameter family of solutions , which is given by @xmath311 and @xmath312 the reason for choosing the parameter @xmath74 in this particular way will become clear in a moment .",
    "the motivation is to have a certain symmetry between the spatial components @xmath313 and @xmath195 of the matrix @xmath303 on one side , and the variables @xmath74 and @xmath33 on the other side .    due to the square roots in the denominator",
    ", there is obviously a restricted range @xmath314 for the new parameter .",
    "to avoid such a non - trivial restriction on the range of the phase space variables later on , it is useful to replace the variable @xmath150 by a new variable @xmath63 , so that @xmath315 the expression for the transition function @xmath303 then simplifies slightly and becomes @xmath316 where @xmath317 is defined so that the @xmath303 has a unit determinant , @xmath318 here we should note the similarity to the formula ( [ rpp - mom - mvqs ] ) , defining the momentum vectors of the free particles .",
    "if the group element @xmath303 is considered as the spatial momentum of the particles , the @xmath74 and @xmath33 are generalized versions of the radial and angular momentum .    to see what kind of group element @xmath303 it is , let us rewrite it in the following alternative way .",
    "we replace the cartesian coordinates @xmath74 and @xmath33 by polar coordinates @xmath39 and @xmath40 , so that @xmath319 this is obviously a generalization of ( [ rpp - qs - k ] ) , to which it reduces in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "it follows that @xmath320 , and the transition function becomes @xmath321 it represents a boost with rapidity @xmath322 and angular direction @xmath40 .",
    "there is thus a certain relation between the transition functions @xmath323 and the energies @xmath38 of the particles on one side , and the transition function @xmath303 and the spatial momentum @xmath39 of the particles on the other side .",
    "of course , we thereby assume that @xmath39 still defines the spatial momentum , in the same way as previously for the free particles .      to see",
    "that @xmath38 are in fact the energies , and @xmath39 is the spatial momentum of the particles , let us now have a closer look at the conical singularities , which arise at the corners of the half spaces in figure  [ emb ] when they are glued together .",
    "we somehow have to ensure that the spacetime metric in the neighbourhood of a world line represents the gravitational field of a point particle with a fixed mass @xmath283 .",
    "it has to be a cone with a deficit angle of @xmath229 , when this angle is measured in the rest frame of the particle . in the static case",
    ", we can read off this deficit angle directly from the geometry of space in figure  [ emb ] , or figure  [ tip](b ) . in general , however , we first have to transform to the rest frame of the particle , as otherwise the deficit angle is proportional to the energy and not to the rest mass .",
    "an alternative way to derive the deficit angle is to consider the _",
    "holonomy _ of the particle .",
    "this is , by definition , the lorentz rotation that acts on a spacetime vector which is transported once around the particle , say , in clockwise direction .",
    "if the deficit angle of the particle @xmath12 is @xmath229 , then the holonomy is a rotation by @xmath229 about some timelike axis .",
    "the axis is parallel to the world line , and thus the holonomy also defines the direction of motion of the particle .",
    "massless particles can also be included .",
    "the holonomy is then a null rotation , and the world line is lightlike .",
    "the holonomy is in this sense a generalized , group valued momentum of the particle @xcite .    if we think of the embedding minkowski space in figure  [ emb ] as a spacetime atlas consisting of two charts , then a spacetime vector is simply represented by a minkowski vector , which is attached to some point on one of the two half spaces . as long as we stick to this half space",
    ", the parallel transport is trivial .",
    "but whenever we pass across one of the edges @xmath245 or @xmath181 from @xmath249 to @xmath248 , we have to act on the vector with the appropriate transition function , hence @xmath323 or @xmath303 . and",
    "when we pass from @xmath248 to @xmath249 , we have to act on the vector with the inverse transition function .",
    "there are then all together four holonomies that can be defined .",
    "we can choose the particle @xmath12 to be surrounded , and we can choose the half space @xmath250 in which the path begins and ends .",
    "let us define @xmath324 to be the lorentz rotation acting on a vector which is first defined in the half space @xmath250 , and then transported in clockwise direction around the particle @xmath12 .",
    "sorting out the factor ordering and the signs , we find that @xmath325 for @xmath326 to be a rotation by @xmath229 in clockwise direction , it has to be an element of the conjugacy class of @xmath327 in @xmath328 .",
    "this special element represents a clockwise rotation by @xmath229 about the @xmath31-axis .",
    "all others are obtained by acting on this with a proper lorentz rotation , hence a conjugation with some other element of the lorentz group .",
    "the conjugacy class is defined by the following _ mass shell _ and _ positive energy _",
    "condition @xcite @xmath329 since the trace of the holonomy is independent of the factor ordering , this is one equation to be satisfied for each particle .",
    "actually , each particle has only one holonomy @xmath330 .",
    "the two different values @xmath331 and @xmath332 arise because the same physical object is represented in two coordinate charts .",
    "if the holonomy is interpreted as a generalized momentum , then the mass shell constraints are obviously generalizations of the free particle constraints ( [ rpp - mss ] ) .",
    "there is now , however , a restriction on the mass parameters @xmath283 , which has no counterpart for the free particles .",
    "the deficit angle of a cone must be smaller then @xmath9 , and consequently the rest mass of a particle is bounded from above by @xmath333 , where @xmath3 is the planck mass . at this upper bound , the cosine in ( [ hol - con ] ) takes its minimum @xmath334 , and the holonomy becomes a full rotation by @xmath9 . for a massless particle , on the other hand , the cosine is equal to one , which means that the holonomy is a null rotation .",
    "the same restriction applies to the total energy @xmath32 , which defines the total deficit angle of universe .",
    "we ll see later on that the energy @xmath32 is in fact also bounded from below by @xmath335 , which is the total energy for a static state .",
    "hence , the allowed range for the mass parameters is @xmath336 to see that the free particle mass shell constraints are recovered in the limit @xmath7 , let us write the holonomies as functions of the configuration variables .",
    "it is thereby useful to introduce the following notation .",
    "we define a modified set of trigonometric functions with rescaled arguments , @xmath337 some useful properties of these functions are that the relation @xmath338 remains valid , and in the limit @xmath7 we have @xmath339 , @xmath340 , @xmath341 .",
    "we also introduce an analogous set of hyperbolic functions , but this time it is useful to rescale the argument by a different factor , @xmath342 again , we have @xmath343 , and in the limit @xmath7 we get @xmath344 , @xmath345 , @xmath346 . as an example for the application of these rescaled function , consider the definition ( [ qs - k ] ) , relating @xmath74 and @xmath33 to @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "they simplify to @xmath347 and @xmath39 can be written as a function of @xmath74 , @xmath33 , and @xmath63 , @xmath348 according to the general rule @xmath345 , this reduces to ( [ rpp - k - qs ] ) in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "similar rules apply to all other formulas below .",
    "they always reduce to the free particle counterparts in the limit where the gravitational interaction is switched off .    to express the holonomies and finally the mass shell constraints in terms of the energy and momentum variables , it is useful to make the same redefinition that we previously also made for the free particles .",
    "we replace the mass parameters @xmath283 by a total mass @xmath44 and a relative mass @xmath45 , assuming without loss of generality that @xmath349 , @xmath350 like for the free particles , the special cases are @xmath48 , where both particles have the same mass , and @xmath49 , where at least one of the particles is massless .",
    "the only new feature is the upper bound for @xmath44 , which goes to infinity in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , we also replace the energy variables @xmath38 by the total energy @xmath32 and a relative energy @xmath54 , so that @xmath351 the upper bound on @xmath32 follows from the fact that the total deficit angle of the spinning cone must be smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "the restriction on @xmath54 is the positive energy condition , which implies that @xmath352 for both particles .    using all this",
    ", we can finally express the transition functions ( [ ehol - mv ] ) and ( [ chol - k ] ) in terms of the new energy and momentum variables .",
    "what we get is @xmath353 it is then not difficult to evaluate the traces of the holonomies , and to express the mass shell constraints in terms of the same variables .",
    "they are given by @xmath354 this is the same as ( 2.36 ) in @xcite , if @xmath39 is interpreted as the common spatial momentum of both particles in the centre of mass frame , and @xmath355 are the energies of the particles , which are in general different .",
    "finally , we have to rescale the actual mass shell constraints by an appropriate power of @xmath2 , in order to get the correct limit @xmath7 , @xmath356 expanding this up to the second order in @xmath2 , we recover the free particle constraints ( [ rpp - mss - k ] ) in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "and the same applies to the positive energy condition ( [ erg - mv ] ) , where the upper bound on @xmath32 goes to infinity .",
    "we can then proceed in the same way as before .",
    "we use one of the mass shell constraints to eliminate the relative energy @xmath54 .",
    "there is then a single mass shell constraint left , which is going to be the generator of the time evolution .",
    "and we also get an even dimensional phase space which is spanned by six independent variables .",
    "the first step is again to define the linear combinations @xmath357 here we used some trigonometric identities to simplify the results . in the limit @xmath7 , these constraints are equal to ( [ rpp - de ] ) .",
    "however , it is now a little bit more complicated to decouple the variables @xmath39 and @xmath54 .",
    "we have to take another linear combination , namely @xmath358 note that the functions @xmath359 and @xmath360 , and similarly @xmath361 and @xmath362 are well defined within the range ( [ mu - nu ] ) and ( [ erg - mv ] ) .",
    "the first poles of these functions are just outside the allowed range of the arguments .",
    "now , the positive energy condition implies @xmath363 , and the function @xmath364 is invertible within the allowed range of @xmath54 .",
    "we can solve the equation @xmath53 for @xmath54 , setting @xmath365 the function @xmath366 is the inverse of @xmath364 , @xmath367 and in the limit @xmath7 we have @xmath368 . using this and",
    "the fact that @xmath364 and @xmath366 are both monotonically increasing , the positive energy condition becomes a non - trivial condition to be imposed on @xmath32 , namely @xmath369 this is obviously a generalized version on ( [ rpp - erg - m ] ) , with all mass parameters and energy variables replaced by their rescaled tangent .",
    "this is in fact a rather general rule , which tells us how to obtain the various structures of the kepler system from those of the free particle system .",
    "consider for example the mass shell constraint that remains after eliminating @xmath54 from ( [ de ] ) . to derive this",
    ", we have to take yet another linear combination , namely @xmath370 again , the coefficients are well defined , because the range ( [ erg - mv ] ) of @xmath32 is exactly the interval where both @xmath371 and @xmath372 are different from zero . evaluating this linear combination ,",
    "@xmath54 drops out , and after some trigonometric simplifications we get @xmath373 here , @xmath374 is a constant , which only depends on the mass parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and @xmath86 is the same function that also appears in ( [ rpp - ef ] ) , but once again with the masses @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and the energy @xmath32 are replaced by @xmath375 , @xmath376 , and @xmath361 , respectively , @xmath377 roughly speaking , the rule is to replace all mass and energy quantities @xmath378 by @xmath379 , and to replace the momentum @xmath39 by @xmath380 .",
    "then we obtain the mass shell constraints of the kepler system from those of the free particle system , and also , for example , the relation ( [ k - qs ] ) between the radial momentum @xmath74 , the angular momentum @xmath33 , and the total spatial momentum @xmath39 of the particles .",
    "as all these modifications become identities in the limit @xmath7 , we can say that the kepler system is a _ deformation _ of the free particle system , and newton s constant is the deformation parameter .",
    "we ll now see that this also applies to the various phase space structures , such as the symplectic potential , the poisson brackets , and the hamiltonian .",
    "so far , we have seen that all physically relevant quantities , including the geometry of space , the positions of the particles with respect to the centre of mass frame , as well as the holonomies and the mass shell constraints , can be expressed as a function of six independent variables , the energy and momentum variables @xmath32 , @xmath74 , @xmath33 , and the time and position variables @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . in analogy to the free particles , we define the _ extended _ phase space @xmath381 note that we do not impose any restriction on the energy @xmath32 at this point .",
    "the positive energy condition ( [ erg - m ] ) is imposed together with the constraint ( [ e ] ) , and this defines the physical subspace .",
    "the hamiltonian on @xmath89 is again proportional to the mass shell constraint .",
    "thus if we introduce a multiplier @xmath82 , we have in analogy to ( [ rpp - ham - ext ] ) @xmath382 to derive the equations of motion , we also have to know the symplectic structure on @xmath89 .",
    "but so far , there is no natural way to define it , and there is also no reason why it should be the same as that of the free particle system . since we do not want to make any additional assumptions ,",
    "we can only _ derive _ the symplectic structure from the underlying field theory of einstein gravity .",
    "thus , we have to apply a straightforward phase space reduction to the einstein hilbert action .",
    "the actual derivation is rather involved and technical , but on the other hand it can be carried out without further complications for a general multi particle model .",
    "it is therefore given in a separate article @xcite .",
    "we are here not going to say anything in detail about this derivation .",
    "we just take the general result , and adapt it to the special case of a two particle system . the general expression ( 3.9 ) in @xcite , adapted to the special situation given in figure  [ emb ] , is @xmath383 here , @xmath38 are the energies of the particles @xmath12 , @xmath384 and @xmath385 are their absolute positions with respect to the conical reference frame , @xmath305 is the relative position vector of the particles in the half space @xmath248 , and @xmath303 is the transition function mapping the edge @xmath296 onto @xmath297",
    ".    this expression does not look symmetric , but in fact it is , which can be seen by replacing @xmath305 and @xmath303 with @xmath304 and @xmath386 . to express the symplectic potential in terms of our six independent phase space variables",
    ", we have to insert the expressions ( [ t - cone ] ) for @xmath384 and @xmath385 , ( [ dis - cone ] ) for @xmath256 , and ( [ chol - qs ] ) for @xmath303 .",
    "the result is very simple and reads , up to a total derivative that can be neglected , @xmath387 this is almost the same as the free particle expression ( [ rpp - pot - ext ] ) .",
    "there is only one modification . the angular momentum @xmath33 , which is conjugate to the orientation @xmath64 of the particles , is rescaled by a factor @xmath388 .",
    "this factor takes values between zero and one , and obviously it has to do with the conical geometry of the spacetime at spatial infinity . as a consequence",
    ", we have the following almost canonical poisson brackets @xmath389 but the following non - canonical brackets involving the angular momentum @xmath33 , @xmath390 the last one results from an off - diagonal term in the symplectic two - form @xmath77 , involving a product of @xmath391 and @xmath392 .",
    "the brackets can most easily be derived if we notice that the canonically conjugate angular momentum is actually @xmath393 all other brackets with @xmath394 are zero . the brackets ( [ pois - s ] ) are then easily found by expressing @xmath33 as a function of @xmath394 and @xmath32 . but",
    "let us nevertheless stick to @xmath33 as one of the basic phase space variables , because it has an immediate geometric interpretation , defining the time offset of the spinning cone .",
    "it also shows up in the transition function @xmath303 defined in ( [ chol - qs ] ) , and in the mass shell constraint ( [ e ] ) , implicitly through the definition ( [ k - qs ] ) of @xmath39 .",
    "now we have all the structures at hand which we need to describe the kinematical and dynamical features of the kepler system .",
    "in particular , we can now derive the equations of motion , study the classical trajectories , and finally we can quantize the kepler system . at each step , the result will be a deformed version of the corresponding free particle result .",
    "the most interesting feature is thereby the deformation of the symplectic structure by the factor in front of the angular momentum .",
    "apparently , this is only a marginal modification .",
    "however , it turns out that it is responsible for some unexpected effects at the quantum level .",
    "for example , the particles can no longer be localized in space , and they can not come closer to each other than a specific distance .",
    "but for the moment we shall stick to the classical phase space .",
    "some basic features of the kepler system can be inferred immediately from the given phase space structures .",
    "for example , we have a two dimensional rigid symmetry group of time translations @xmath395 and spatial rotations @xmath80 .",
    "the hamiltonian and the symplectic potential are both invariant . at the spacetime level , these are the killing symmetries of the spinning cone .",
    "the rigid symmetries are the possible translations and rotations of the universe with respect to the reference frame @xcite .",
    "the conserved charges associated with these symmetries are obviously @xmath32 and @xmath394 .    actually , we expected @xmath33 to be the angular momentum .",
    "it is a function of @xmath32 and @xmath394 , thus also a conserved charge , but the associated symmetry is a combination of a time translation and a spatial rotation .",
    "it is a _ screw rotation _ of the spinning cone .",
    "the killing vector of this symmetry is a linear combination of the killing vectors of time translations and spatial rotations .",
    "it is orthogonal to the killing vector of time translations , whereas the rotational killing vector associated with @xmath394 has closed orbits of affine length @xmath9 . unless the spinning cone is static , this is not the same .",
    "the definition of an angular momentum is therefore somewhat ambiguous .",
    "we can also define a _ reduced _ phase space @xmath88 , in the very same way as before . instead of a mass shell constraint , the time evolution",
    "is then provided by a hamiltonian that represents the physical energy . to go over from the _ constrained _ to the _ unconstrained _ formulation",
    ", we have to solve the mass shell constraint @xmath96 , and additionally we have to impose a suitable gauge condition .",
    "as all this is completely analogous to the free particles .",
    "we can choose the same natural gauge condition , requiring the adm time @xmath26 to be equal to the absolute time @xmath62 in the centre of mass frame .",
    "what we get is a pair of second class constraints , @xmath396 since @xmath86 is more or less the same function as before , just with some modified mass parameters , it can still be inverted , defining @xmath32 as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "the explicit solution is given in ( [ ham - red ] ) below .",
    "it is thus possible to remove the canonical pair @xmath397 , and to go over to a four dimensional , completely reduced phase space @xmath398 to derive the symplectic potential @xmath93 and the hamiltonian @xmath94 on @xmath88 , we have to start from the extended symplectic potential on @xmath89 , again because the gauge condition above is explicitly time dependent . according to ( [ ham - ext ] ) and ( [ pot - ext ] ) , it is given by @xmath399 on the reduced phase space ,",
    "this becomes @xmath400 to derive the reduced hamiltonian @xmath94 , we have to solve the equation ( [ gauge - con ] ) for @xmath32 , so that the positive energy condition ( [ erg - m ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the unique solution is @xmath401 where @xmath39 is given by ( [ k - qs ] ) as a function of the @xmath74 , @xmath33 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the deformed mass parameters @xmath402 are just some useful abbreviations .",
    "they are given by @xmath403 so , we find a somewhat deformed hamiltonian , as compared to the free particle definition ( [ rpp - ham - red ] ) .",
    "it still depends only on the momentum @xmath39 , and not , for example , on the relative position @xmath63 .",
    "this we might have expected as a kind of gravitational potential . however , in three dimensional einstein gravity , there are no local gravitational forces , and therefore we do not have a gravitational potential .",
    "but nevertheless , there is something like a gravitational binding energy . to see this ,",
    "let us briefly discuss the range of @xmath94 , and the way it depends on the momentum @xmath39 .",
    "first of all , we easily see that @xmath94 is minimal for @xmath99 , where it takes the value @xmath404 as for the free particles , the static states with @xmath99 are excluded if at least one of the particles is massless . in this case , the positive energy condition ( [ erg - m ] ) requires @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , for small momenta @xmath39 , the energy also increases linearly if a massless particle is present , and quadratically if both particles are massive . for massive particles",
    ", we can also consider a non - relativistic limit , where @xmath39 is small and the particles are moving slowly compared to the speed of light . expanding ( [ ham - red ] ) up to the second order in @xmath39",
    "gives @xmath405 apart from the deformed expression for the reduced mass @xmath406 , we have the usual non - relativistic behaviour of the kinetic energy .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath407 , thus the reduced mass of the coupled system is always larger than the reduced mass of the free particles in ( [ rpp - red - mss ] ) .",
    "this is the only effect of the gravitational coupling for low momenta . for a given value of @xmath39 ,",
    "the energy of the coupled system is slightly smaller than the free energy .",
    "there is still no gravitational potential .",
    "in particular , we do not recover newtonian gravity . in three spacetime dimensions ,",
    "this is not the non - relativistic limit of einstein gravity .",
    "the relation between the two theories only exists in higher dimensions .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath94 for large momenta @xmath39 is changed more drastically , as compared to the free particle system .",
    "asymptotically , the energy is no longer linear in @xmath39 .",
    "the right hand side in ( [ ham - red ] ) is bounded from above by @xmath8 .",
    "the energy asymptotically approaches the upper bound for large momenta @xmath39 .",
    "this is also a non - trivial result , because we might have expected that the upper bound @xmath8 for the total energy @xmath32 imposes some upper bound on the spatial momentum @xmath39 as well .",
    "but it seems that the gravitational interaction knows about this upper bound , and takes it into account in the relation between momentum and energy . to compare the energy momentum relation for the free and the coupled particles , we have plotted them for some typical mass parameters in figure  [ dsp ] .    [ dsp ]    for low momenta , the behaviour is very similar",
    ", we just have a slightly modified reduced mass @xmath407 for massive particles .",
    "this implies that the energy of the coupled system is a little bit smaller than the free particle energy . for large momenta , however , we see that the energy of the coupled system approaches @xmath408 , whereas the energy of the free particles increases unboundedly .",
    "we can think of the difference between the free particle energy and the total energy of the coupled system as the negative energy of the gravitational field .",
    "this obviously compensates for the increasing kinetic energy of the particles , so that the total energy remains below the upper bound , which a quarter of the planck energy .",
    "if the momentum @xmath39 is of the order of one tenth of the planck scale , then the negative binding energy is already of the same order of magnitude as the free particle kinetic energy . for momenta which are larger than the planck scale ,",
    "the energy has more or less saturated at the upper bound .",
    "the same behaviour of the energy can be found for a single particle system @xcite , where the upper bound is @xmath6 , thus half of the maximal energy here .",
    "this is a generic feature of three dimensional general relativity .",
    "it has to do with its topological nature .",
    "the gravitational field does not fall off at spatial infinity , which means that the spacetime is not asymptotically flat .",
    "instead , it is asymptotically conical , and therefore it is not possible for the universe to contain more energy than @xmath408 .",
    "but now , let us turn to the more interesting object on the reduced phase space @xmath88 , the symplectic structure .",
    "it follows from ( [ epot - red ] ) that the reduced symplectic potential is given by @xmath409 the somewhat curious feature of this expression is the hamiltonian @xmath94 , which appears at the place where originally the energy @xmath32 has shown up . since @xmath94 depends on @xmath74 , @xmath33 and @xmath63 , the resulting poisson brackets become very complicated , because the two form @xmath77 is far from being diagonal in the given variables .",
    "it is therefore more appropriate first to look for a set of canonically conjugate variables and then to define the poisson brackets .",
    "clearly , what we have to do is to replace the variable @xmath33 by the canonical angular momentum @xmath410 .",
    "doing so , the symplectic potential and the resulting poisson brackets become @xmath411 all other brackets of @xmath74 , @xmath394 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are zero . we can further replace @xmath63 and @xmath74 by the geodesic distance @xmath150 of the particles , given by ( [ r - qx ] ) , and its canonically conjugate momentum  @xmath151 . the transformation reads @xmath412 and the inverse transformation is @xmath413 inserting this into the symplectic potential gives @xmath414 the chart @xmath415 is thus canonical on  @xmath88 , and the coordinates have a straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "this is also the canonical chart introduced in @xcite .    in the chart",
    "@xmath416 the hamiltonian @xmath94 is determined implicitly as the solution to @xmath417 and the corresponding equation in the chart @xmath418 follows by the substitution  ( [ rp - inv ] ) . as @xmath419 involves the rescaled tangent of  @xmath94 , the equation is transcendental in either chart .",
    "the price for simplifying the symplectic potential ( [ pot - red ] ) into ( [ pot - red - j ] ) or into the fully canonical form ( [ pot - red - p ] ) therefore is that @xmath94 can not be expressed as an elementary function of the variables .      to find the classical trajectories , we return to the constrained formulation based on the six dimensional phase space @xmath89 , with the additional independent variables @xmath32 and  @xmath62 , the symplectic structure  ( [ pot - ext ] ) , and the hamiltonian constraint  ( [ ham - ext ] ) .",
    "as @xmath89 is the gravitating version of the special - relativistic phase space of section  [ free ] , we can follow the analysis of section  [ free ] with the appropriate deformations .",
    "the starting point is the hamiltonian , which generates the time evolution with respect to the unphysical adm time @xmath26 .",
    "it is given by the mass shell constraint ( [ e ] ) , and a multiplier @xmath82 , which is some arbitrary function of @xmath26 , @xmath420 this is almost identical to ( [ rpp - ef ] ) , and we can now use the brackets ( [ pois - x ] ) to derive the time evolution equations .",
    "the total energy @xmath32 and the angular momentum @xmath33 are of course conserved charges , and the same holds for the total spatial momentum @xmath39 , @xmath421 the time evolution equations for the radial coordinates are almost the same as ( [ rpp - t - xq ] ) , @xmath422 the only essential modifications arise when we derive the evolution equations for @xmath64 and @xmath62 .",
    "they differ from ( [ rpp - t - t ] ) , because of the non - canonical brackets ( [ pois - s ] ) of @xmath33 with @xmath64 and @xmath62 . for the angular orientation , we find @xmath423 and for the clock @xmath62 we get @xmath424 at first sight , these equations of motion are somewhat complicated , but it is still possible to solve them explicitly , in the same way as in section  [ free ] .",
    "first , we observe that @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath39 are constants of motion .",
    "then , we introduce a function @xmath126 so that @xmath127 . using the same arguments that led to ( [ rpp - mskq - t ] )",
    ", we conclude that @xmath425 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath119 are integration constants .",
    "it is then straightforward to solve the equation of motion for @xmath63 .",
    "the solution is @xmath426 where @xmath136 is some integration constant .",
    "and yet another constant @xmath133 arises when we then solve the equation of motion for @xmath64 , @xmath427 and finally , we can also solve the equation of motion for @xmath62 .",
    "the solution is @xmath428 where @xmath135 is yet another integration constant .",
    "all together , the resulting trajectory is parameterized by the gauge function @xmath126 , and six integration constants @xmath115 , @xmath119 , @xmath116 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath133 . again , only four of them are independent .",
    "it follows from the constraint @xmath96 , and the definition of @xmath39 as a function of @xmath74 , @xmath33 , and @xmath63 that @xmath429 these relations and all the formulas above reduce to their free particle counterparts in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "what applies to the phase space structure , also applies to the classical trajectories of the kepler system .",
    "they reduce to those of the free particles when the gravitational interaction is switched off .",
    "this is also a non - trivial statement .",
    "it implies , for example , that there are no bound states , again as a consequence of the absence of local gravitational forces .    as seen in section",
    "[ free ] , the trajectories on the reduced phase space @xmath88 are obtained from those on @xmath89 by imposing the gauge condition @xmath140 .",
    "we shall now verify that this gauge is always accessible and unique . by construction ,",
    "the trajectories on @xmath88 then solve hamilton s equations with the hamiltonian defined implictly by ( [ ham - j ] ) .",
    "we have to show is that the right hand side of ( [ t - t ] ) is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath126 , and that its range is the whole real line .",
    "if this is the case , then the equation @xmath140 can always be solved for @xmath126 .",
    "that the range is the whole real line can be seen quite easily . in the range of @xmath115 which is allowed by the positive energy condition",
    ", @xmath141 is positive .",
    "hence , if @xmath126 is large , then the @xmath164 term can be neglected as compared to the linear term , which is unbounded .",
    "so , what remains to be shown is that the derivative of the right hand side of ( [ t - t ] ) with respect to @xmath126 is positive .",
    "we know already that , up to a factor of @xmath430 , this derivative is equal to the right hand side of ( [ t - t ] ) .",
    "this is how it was derived .",
    "hence , we have to show that for all physical states @xmath431 the constraint ( [ e - qs ] ) implies that @xmath432 it is therefore sufficient to show that @xmath433 this can be simplified further , using the following estimation .",
    "for @xmath434 we have @xmath435 . with @xmath436 ,",
    "this implies @xmath437 hence , it is also sufficient to show @xmath438 now , all we have to do is to insert the definition ( [ f - def ] ) for @xmath86 and compute its derivative .",
    "it is then very easy to verify that this inequality is indeed satisfied , provided that the positive energy condition holds , that is @xmath439 .",
    "thus , we conclude that a gauge function @xmath126 exists , so that @xmath140 , although we do not know it explicitly .",
    "let us now describe the physical properties of the trajectories , in particular the way they deviate from the free particle trajectories .",
    "since the relative position @xmath63 is still an auxiliary variable , we should first replace it by the actual geodesic distance @xmath150 between the particles . and",
    "it is also useful to consider the previously defined canonically conjugate momentum @xmath151 . using ( [ rp - def ] )",
    ", we find that on the given trajectories we have @xmath440 here , we can first of all see that the assumption was correct that @xmath39 represents the ingoing and outgoing momentum of the particles .",
    "if @xmath441 is large , then the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath442 approaches @xmath443 . as for the free particles",
    ", we expect the eigenvalues of @xmath39 to specify the inverse radial wavelength at infinity , when the system is quantized .",
    "but now , let us consider the actual trajectories .",
    "first we assume that @xmath143 .",
    "according to ( [ orb - par ] ) , this implies that @xmath144 and @xmath123 . in this case , the particles approach each other from infinity from some direction @xmath145 , they reach a minimal distance @xmath136 at the absolute time @xmath135 and with angular orientation @xmath133 , and afterwards the separate again , moving to infinity into a direction @xmath146 .",
    "the interpretation of the integration constants @xmath115 and @xmath116 is also obvious .",
    "these are the total energy and the angular momentum , which are constant along the trajectory .",
    "so far , everything is the same as before .",
    "however , there is now a crucial difference , because now we have a real scattering .",
    "the angular directions @xmath145 and @xmath146 are given by @xmath444 it is no longer so that @xmath445 .",
    "instead , the scattering angle is @xmath446 the scattering angle depends on the deficit angle of the spinning cone , thus on the energy of the particles , and the direction of the scattering depends on the sign of the angular momentum , thus on which side the two particles pass each other .",
    "this is not a surprise , because it is the typical behaviour of a pair geodesics on a cone , and of course also on a spinning cone .",
    "in fact , the world lines of the particles can effectively be considered as a pair of geodesics on antipodal sides of the spinning cone @xcite . however , the crucial point is that the geometry of this spinning cone depends on the energy and the angular momentum of the particles .",
    "the particles are not just moving on a fixed background cone .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for large momenta @xmath119 , thus for @xmath447 , the factor in the denominator in ( [ scatter ] ) becomes arbitrarily small . in this case",
    ", the particles wind around each other many times before they separate again .",
    "we also see that the scattering angle is always larger than @xmath5 .",
    "this means , in a sense , that gravity is attractive , even though there are no local forces .",
    "the case @xmath157 is again somewhat special .",
    "according to ( [ orb - par ] ) , we either have @xmath129 or @xmath158 . for @xmath129",
    ", we have a static state .",
    "the particles are at rest , with a fixed distance @xmath144 , and a fixed angular orientation @xmath133 .",
    "the geometry of space is that of figure  [ tip ] , and it is constant in time .",
    "the total energy is @xmath163 , and the integration constant @xmath135 is redundant .",
    "the more interesting case is @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "let us once again consider the limit @xmath165 and @xmath166 , with @xmath123 and all other integration constant fixed .",
    "what we find is similar to ( [ rpp - x - t - coll ] ) , @xmath448 again , the particles approach each other on a radial line with direction @xmath145 , then they hit in a head on collision at the absolute time @xmath135 , and after that they continue on a radial line with direction @xmath146",
    ". however , there is now a crucial difference to the free particles .",
    "the relation between @xmath145 and @xmath146 is no longer independent of the sign of @xmath116 , and thus the limit is actually not well defined .",
    "we have @xmath449 which depends on the sign , unless @xmath450 .",
    "these are very special cases where the deficit angle of the universe takes a value in a certain discrete set .",
    "clearly , this is the typical behaviour of a geodesic on a cone .",
    "if the geodesic hits the tip , then it does not have a unique continuation .",
    "if it is considered as a limit of a family of geodesics missing the tip , then its continuation depends on the way we take the limit . to get a unique time evolution",
    ", we have to say explicitly what the particles have to do when they hit each other .",
    "quite remarkably , this ambiguity disappears at the quantum level .",
    "the following semi - classical argument explains why .",
    "the problem only arises when the angular momentum @xmath33 vanishes .",
    "but then , the angular orientation @xmath64 is smeared out uniformly over all directions .",
    "hence , for @xmath271 there is anyway no well defined scattering angle , because both @xmath145 and @xmath146 are maximally uncertain .    apart from this ambiguity , the classical dynamics of the kepler system is well defined on the extended phase space @xmath89 , and the trajectories are easy to derive .",
    "implicitly , this also defines the trajectories on the reduced phase space @xmath88 .",
    "we know that they exist , and of course they have the same physical properties , but we can not write them down explicitly . to go back to the spacetime picture , we have to perform the construction in figure  [ emb ] at each moment of adm time @xmath26 . what we get is a space that evolves in time , and this provides a foliation of the spacetime manifold by slices of constant absolute time in the centre of mass frame .",
    "we can either take this general relativistic point of view , but we may also stick to a simplified point of view where we just think of two particles moving in a two dimensional space .",
    "with all the preparations made in the previous sections , we can now , finally , quantize the kepler system . as an ansatz",
    ", we shall first try the schrdinger method , based on the reduced phase space @xmath88 .",
    "this turns out to fail , due to a somewhat peculiar feature of the classical phase space .",
    "its global structure is not as simple as it appears , which implies that a straightforward choice of a set of commuting configuration variables does not provide a proper basis of the quantum hilbert space .",
    "we already noticed that the definition of the poisson brackets and the hamiltonian was technically somewhat involved , and we were not able , for example , to define the hamiltonian explicitly as a functions of a set of canonically conjugate variables .",
    "this technical problem turns into a principle one at the quantum level .",
    "the way out is to use the dirac quantization method , based on the extended phase space @xmath89 . on this phase space",
    ", the mass shell constraint can easily be expressed as a function of a set of canonically conjugate variables . instead of solving the schrdinger equation , we have to impose a constraint .",
    "it becomes a generalized klein gordon equation and defines the physical hilbert space .",
    "just like the classical phase space , the quantum hilbert space turns out to be a deformed version of the free particle hilbert space .",
    "finally , we are going to write down the energy eigenstates explicitly as wave functions in space and time , and from them we read off some interesting effects of quantum gravity .",
    "the most straightforward way to quantize the kepler system seems to be a schrdinger quantization , based on the completely reduced phase space @xmath88 defined in ( [ psp ] ) , and spanned by the variables @xmath74 , @xmath33 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "apparently , the only technical problem is to define the hamiltonian @xmath94 explicitly as a quantum operator , which is given by ( [ ham - red ] ) .",
    "however , a first obstacle already arises when we look at the symplectic potential ( [ pot - red ] ) , which explicitly depends on this function , @xmath451 this we have to take into account when we set up the operator representation .",
    "we saw , however , that we may equally well replace the variable @xmath33 by @xmath452 and consequently we have the canonical brackets @xmath453 now the quantization is straightforward .",
    "we choose a basis where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are diagonal .",
    "the wave functions is @xmath173 , with @xmath177 , and @xmath175 has a period of @xmath9 if the particles are distinguishable , or the period is @xmath5 if the particles are identical .",
    "we introduce a statistics parameter @xmath181 , in the same way as previously for the free particles .",
    "we may also define the same scalar product , @xmath454 which implies that @xmath173 is the usual probability amplitude in polar coordinates . and",
    "it is also straightforward to define the operator representation , which is given by @xmath455 for the position operators , and the momentum operators are @xmath456 so far , everything is the same as before .",
    "it seems that the only technical problem is to express the hamiltonian @xmath94 in terms of @xmath63 , @xmath74 , and @xmath394 .",
    "it is now implicitly defined by the equation ( [ ham - j ] ) , thus @xmath457 since we could not even solve this equation explicitly at the classical level , it is of course also impossible to derive an explicit operator representation for @xmath94 at the quantum level .",
    "nevertheless , since we know that the hamiltonian is well defined on the classical phase space , this only seems to be a technical problem .",
    "but if we look at all this more closely , we find that the problem is actually not a technical , but a principle one .",
    "in fact , we made a wrong assumption in the above derivation .",
    "to set up a quantum representation like the one given above , it is not sufficient to pick out a complete set of commuting phase space variables like @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and to define the wave function @xmath173 to be a function on this _ configuration space_. there is a second consistency condition , which is sometimes overlooked because it is usually immediately obvious .",
    "the classical phase space has to be the _ cotangent bundle _ of the configuration space , equipped with its canonical symplectic structure . at each point @xmath458 of the configuration space , the canonically conjugate momenta , which are @xmath459 in our case , have to span a vector space . splitting the phase space into a configuration and a momentum space like this",
    "is called a _ polarization _ @xcite .    without going into any details ,",
    "let us roughly show what goes wrong when the second criterion is not satisfied . given a hilbert space such that to each point",
    "@xmath174 in the configuration space there corresponds a basis state @xmath460 , then for every bounded function @xmath86 on the configuration space there exists a bounded self adjoint operator , whose eigenstates are @xmath460 with eigenvalues @xmath461 .",
    "this is just usual quantum mechanics , for example in the position representation .",
    "consequently , there is also a family of unitary operators @xmath462 , representing the flow of @xmath86 . on the classical phase space",
    ", this flow is a translation in the conjugate momentum space .",
    "therefore , the whole construction is consistent only if the momentum space at each point @xmath174 of the configuration space is at least an affine space .",
    "it can be made a vector space by choosing some origin .",
    "now , coming back to the kepler system , let us check whether the second criterion is satisfied or not .",
    "we have to find out whether for every fixed point in the configuration space @xmath458 , the canonically conjugate momenta @xmath459 span a vector space .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case . to see this ,",
    "consider the following estimation , @xmath463 the first factor can be estimated further by @xmath464 which follows from @xmath465 for @xmath466 , and with @xmath467 . using this , we find that @xmath468 the last inequality follows from the following property of the function @xmath86 defined in ( [ f - def ] ) .",
    "for @xmath469 , which follows from the positive energy condition , we have @xmath470 hence , all together it follows that @xmath471 the canonical angular momentum @xmath394 is restricted to some interval around zero , whose size is determined by the configuration variable @xmath63 .",
    "thus , at a fixed point @xmath458 of the configuration space , the canonical momenta @xmath459 do _ not _ span a vector space .",
    "we have to conclude that the above definition of a position representation is not the correct quantization of the given classical phase space .",
    "of course , we could now argue that we simply picked out the wrong configuration space .",
    "we just have to find an appropriate configuration space to perform the correct quantization .",
    "but then we would lose the simple physical interpretation of the configuration variables , and consequently the direct interpretation of the wave function as a probability amplitude in the usual sense .",
    "therefore , to avoid this unnecessary complication , we shall not try to quantize the kepler system bases on the reduced phase space @xmath88      the whole problem can be circumvented when we use the dirac method instead .",
    "the extended phase space @xmath89 defined in ( [ qsp ] ) has the additional independent variables @xmath32 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is a proper cotangent bundle with its canonical symplectic potential ( [ pot - ext ] ) , @xmath472 the configuration space is spanned by @xmath473 , and the canonically conjugate momenta @xmath474 have an unrestricted range for fixed @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the quantization is straightforward .",
    "we have a wave function @xmath214 , with @xmath177 , and regarding the periodicity in @xmath175 we have the same relations as before . if the particles are distinguishable , we have @xmath475 and for identical particles the stronger relation is @xmath476 where the statistics parameter @xmath181 is a fixed real number .",
    "the position operators are given by @xmath477 where the last equation is again to be understood with @xmath64 replaced by a periodic function thereof . for the clock and the canonically",
    "conjugate energy we have @xmath478 and finally , we need the momentum operators @xmath74 and @xmath33 . as @xmath33 can be expressed as a simple function of @xmath32 and @xmath394 , let us first define @xmath479 the operator for @xmath33 can then be expressed as @xmath480 the constant @xmath10 is the _ planck length _ , which is here actually interpreted as a _ planck time_. so , we have a somewhat unusual operator representation for the angular momentum @xmath33 , which is non - local in @xmath215 .",
    "but this is not a serious problem . finally , we have the following scalar product , with respect to which all these operators are self adjoint , and which is formally the same as ( [ rpp - prod - dir ] ) , @xmath481 this completes the definition of the extended hilbert space .",
    "now we have to impose the mass shell constraint to define the physical hilbert space .",
    "the constraint is given by ( [ e - qs ] ) , so we should first try to diagonalize the operator @xmath482 it acts on a wave function as @xmath483 where @xmath484 is a deformed laplacian , @xmath485 now , suppose that the operator @xmath388 in parenthesis is also diagonal .",
    "then @xmath484 is the laplacian on a cone with a deficit angle of @xmath275 .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "we found that the classical particles are effectively moving on such a cone .",
    "the eigenfunctions are still bessel function , however with slightly modified indices and arguments .",
    "the normalized eigenstates are parameterized by three quantum numbers @xmath207 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 , and they are explicitly given by @xmath486 this reduces to ( [ rpp - chi - dir ] ) in the limit @xmath7 , which implies @xmath487 and @xmath345 .",
    "we are here imposing the same regularity condition at @xmath179 that we also imposed in section  [ free ] . following the arguments in @xcite",
    ", we require the wave function to stay finite .",
    "this makes ( [ op - k - basis ] ) a well defined self adjoint operator .",
    "the eigenstates are normalized in the same way as ( [ rpp - chi - norm - dir ] ) , thus @xmath488 the quantum numbers @xmath489 and @xmath207 are continuous , and @xmath195 is discrete .",
    "it takes the values @xmath490 or @xmath491 , depending on whether the particles are distinguishable or not .",
    "this follows again from the periodicity condition imposed on the wave function .",
    "taking this into account when summing over @xmath195 , we have the following completeness relation for the eigenstates , @xmath492 where @xmath205 is again the periodic delta function satisfying the ( [ stat ] ) or ( [ stat - id ] ) .",
    "so , we now have a basis of the extended hilbert space , where the energy and momentum operators are diagonal , with eigenvalues @xmath493 we see that the spectrum of @xmath394 is the one which is quantized in steps of @xmath4 , like the angular momentum of the free particles in ( [ rpp - eigen - mks ] ) .",
    "this is reasonable . on the classical phase space it is the charge @xmath394 which generates a rotation with closed orbits , and a period of @xmath9 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath33 is also discrete , but the eigenvalues additionally depend on the eigenvalues of @xmath32 .",
    "the closer the energy gets to the maximal physical energy @xmath494 , the larger the steps are between the eigenvalues of @xmath33 .",
    "we shall discuss this spectrum and its physical implications at the very end of this section .",
    "it is now straightforward to impose the mass shell constraint .",
    "we can simply repeat all the steps from section  [ free ] .",
    "the constraint acts on the energy momentum eigenstates as @xmath495 it is again useful to introduce a _ dispersion relation _ @xmath496",
    "it is the quantum version of the classical relation between the momentum @xmath39 and the energy @xmath32 , which is shown in figure  [ dsp ] .",
    "we conclude that the physical states are those energy momentum eigenstates , where the quantum numbers satisfy @xmath223 .",
    "these states are annihilated by the constraint ( [ tcon - op ] ) .",
    "the most general physical state is a superposition @xmath497 where @xmath211 is again the wave function in momentum space .",
    "let us once again split off the dependence on the radial coordinate , writing @xmath498 the radial wave function is then given by @xmath499 here we replaced the rescaled hyperbolic functions by the usual ones , to see that only the planck length @xmath500 appears as a dimensionful constant . in the limit @xmath487",
    ", we still recover the free particle expression ( [ rpp - zeta ] ) .      before we read off any physical information from the wave functions",
    ", we have to transform to a representation where the geodesic distance @xmath150 between the particles is diagonal , and not the auxiliary variable @xmath63 .",
    "so , the task is to find the eigenstates of @xmath150 and then to transform the wave functions into this representation .",
    "according to ( [ r - qx ] ) , we have @xmath501 , thus @xmath502 the eigenfunctions of this operator are modified bessel functions of the second kind , @xmath503 the eigenvalues @xmath504 are positive , as it should be , and continuous .",
    "the eigenstates are orthonormal , @xmath505 and complete @xmath506 the transformation of a wave function from the @xmath63-representation to the @xmath150-representation is given by @xmath507 for simplicity , we use the same symbol for the wave function in both representations .",
    "this transformation is known as the kontorovich lebedev transform @xcite .",
    "the scalar product in the @xmath150-representation becomes @xmath508 so that the transformed wave function @xmath509 represents the correct probability amplitude in the relative position space of the particles .",
    "we can finally write down the most general physical state as a wave function in the position representation .",
    "all we have to do is to transform the radial wave functions ( [ zeta - x ] ) from the @xmath63-representation to the @xmath150-representation , thus @xmath510 this convolution can be carried out explicitly , and the result can be expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function @xcite , @xmath511 where @xmath512",
    "so , we finally have a rather complicated but explicit representation of the physical energy eigenstates as wave functions in the relative position space of the particles .",
    "the operators for @xmath150 and @xmath64 , representing the distance and the orientation of the particles , are diagonal in this representation .",
    "it is therefore possible to read off the physical properties of the states directly from the wave functions .",
    "we shall in the following study the radial wave functions @xmath513 , representing the physical states with eigenvalues @xmath514 we shall compare them to the corresponding radial wave functions @xmath513 of the free particle system , as given by ( [ rpp - zeta ] ) .",
    "there we may simply identify the radial coordinate @xmath174 with @xmath504 , as in the limit @xmath7 the transformation from the @xmath63-representation to the @xmath150-representation is trivial . in both cases ,",
    "the physical hilbert space is spanned by a two parameter family of energy momentum eigenstates , and the quantum numbers @xmath194 and @xmath195 have the same interpretation .",
    "the former is the inverse radial wavelength at infinity , representing the momentum of the incoming and outgoing particles , and the latter is the inverse angular wavelength , representing the angular momentum .    actually , we havent check this yet for the kepler system . for the free particles , it is a well know feature of the bessel function ( [ rpp - zeta ] ) . for large @xmath504",
    "it falls off with @xmath515 , oscillating with a wavelength of @xmath516 .",
    "it is not at all obvious that the function ( [ zeta - r ] ) has the same property .",
    "but we can use the following semi - classical argument .",
    "we have seen in ( [ rp - t ] ) that for the classical trajectories , the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath151 of the distance @xmath150 is equal to @xmath517 for large @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , we expect the eigenfunction of @xmath39 with eigenvalue @xmath518 to be a superposition of an ingoing and an outgoing radial wave , with wavelength @xmath516 for large @xmath504 .",
    "this argument holds for both the free particles , where the corresponding classical relation is ( [ rpp - rp - t ] ) , and for the coupled particles .",
    "an alternative way to see this is as follows .",
    "this argument can be made rigorous by taking into account the correct operator ordering .",
    "but for simplicity let us stick to a semi - classical level .",
    "consider the eigenvalue equation for @xmath39 in the @xmath150-representation . as a phase space function",
    ", we have @xmath519 hence , for large @xmath150 we have @xmath520 . since @xmath151 is canonically conjugate to @xmath150 , and thus represented by the operator @xmath521",
    ", it follows that an eigenfunction of @xmath39 with eigenvalue @xmath522 has a radial wavelength of @xmath516 for large @xmath504 . at this point",
    ", we see what the advantage of the auxiliary variable @xmath63 was . of course",
    ", we could have used @xmath150 and @xmath151 as phase space variables from the very beginning . then , however , we had to solve the eigenvalue equation for ( [ k - rp ] ) , with the appropriate operator ordering . obviously , this is much more difficult than solving the eigenvalue equation for ( [ op - k ] ) , because the hyperbolic functions become a non - local operators in the complex @xmath504-plane .    but now , let us come to the actual physical questions .",
    "we wanted to find out what the basic differences are between the radial wave functions @xmath513 for the free particles and those for the coupled particles .",
    "so far , we know that both represent a scattering state , where the incoming and outgoing particles have a radial wavelength of @xmath516 , and a fixed angular momentum . in other words ,",
    "the wave functions are almost equal for large @xmath504 , where large means some orders of magnitude above the planck length @xmath500 .",
    "the interesting question is what happens at small distances . to see this ,",
    "we have plotted some typical wave functions , for different values of @xmath194 and @xmath195 .    in each of the following figures ,",
    "the value of @xmath195 is fixed , and that of @xmath194 varies .",
    "the upper part of the figure always shows the free particle wave functions , the lower one those for the kepler system , both as a function of the distance @xmath504 , which is measured in units of the planck length @xmath500 . to distinguish the wave functions for different momenta @xmath194 , we use the following rule .",
    "the larger @xmath194 is , the smaller are the gaps in the curves .",
    "the broken curve with the largest gaps represents the smallest momentum , and a solid curve corresponds to the largest momentum in the figure .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath194 are given in units of @xmath523 , so that @xmath524 corresponds to a radial wavelength of @xmath525 at infinity , and to a momentum in physical units of @xmath526 .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath283 are given in units of the plank mass @xmath527 .",
    "they only have a marginal influence on the qualitative behaviour of the wave functions .",
    "we therefore keep them fixed in the following , and we choose two particles with the same mass @xmath528 , thus still far below the maximally allowed rest mass . for simplicity , we shall also restrict to states with integer @xmath195 , thus particles with conventional statistics .",
    "there are no principally different effects occurring for anyons , only the numerical values of some quantities considered below are slightly different .",
    "we shall briefly comment on this at the appropriate place .",
    "[ wav0 ]    as a first example , consider the states with @xmath529 in figure  [ wav0 ] . in the upper part",
    "we see the bessel functions @xmath530 .",
    "they take a maximum at @xmath531 , and fall off with the square root of @xmath504 for large @xmath504 , oscillating with a wavelength of @xmath516 . except for a small region near the origin , which is of the order of ten planck lengths , the wave functions of the kepler system are almost the same . for a vanishing angular momentum ,",
    "the coupled particles behave almost like the free particles .",
    "there is not even a phase shift between the ingoing and outgoing particles , so that far away from the origin the interaction of the particles can not even be detected .",
    "however , the wave function of the coupled particles goes to zero at @xmath531 , so that the probability to find the two particles at the same point in space vanishes .",
    "[ wav1 ]    obviously , the coupled particles try to avoid being both in a region of space which is of the order of the planck scale .",
    "this becomes even more obvious when we look at the states with @xmath532 in figure  [ wav1 ] .",
    "for the free particles , we now have the bessel functions @xmath533 .",
    "they are zero at @xmath531 , and the first maximum is approximately at @xmath534 . for large @xmath504 , they still fall off with the square root of @xmath504 , oscillating with a wavelength of @xmath516 . apart from a different phase of the oscillation ,",
    "this is also the large @xmath504 behaviour of the wave functions of the kepler system . to see this more clearly",
    ", we have plotted the same wave functions for large distances in figure  [ wav2 ] .",
    "the phase shift indicates that an interaction between the ingoing and outgoing particles has taken place .",
    "[ wav2 ]    the more interesting feature is again the behaviour of the wave function for small @xmath504 .",
    "for the free particles , the maximum of the wave function is getting closer to the origin with increasing momentum @xmath194 .",
    "for the coupled particles however , the maximum never gets beyond a certain minimal distance @xmath535 .",
    "in fact , we already found such a minimal distance at the classical level .",
    "remember that the quantum number @xmath195 specifies the eigenvalue @xmath536 of the canonical angular momentum @xmath394 . on the other hand",
    ", we have seen that the classical phase space function @xmath394 is restricted by ( [ j - bound ] ) .",
    "we used this to show that a schrdinger quantization , in a representation where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are diagonal , is not possible .    turning the argument around",
    ", it follows that for a fixed @xmath394 , there is a minimal @xmath63 , and thus also a minimal @xmath150 , since @xmath537 .",
    "consequently , we have the semi - classical relation @xmath538 it follows directly from ( [ j - bound ] ) with @xmath539 . for a fixed angular momentum ,",
    "there is thus a minimal distance between the particles .",
    "it is of the order of the planck length @xmath500 if the angular momentum is of the order of @xmath4 , and it increases linearly with the angular momentum .",
    "the numerical factor in ( [ r - min ] ) depends on the masses of the particles , defining the number @xmath374 in ( [ f - def ] ) .",
    "we see in figure  [ wav1 ] that beyond the point @xmath535 the wave function is no longer oscillating , but falls off exponentially . in the classically forbidden region ,",
    "the wave function shows the typical tunneling behaviour .",
    "another peculiar observation is the following . for large momenta @xmath194 ,",
    "the wave function of the coupled particles _ freezes _ at small distances @xmath504 .",
    "more precisely , for small @xmath504 and large @xmath194 the radial wave function @xmath513 no longer depends on @xmath194 .",
    "the limiting wave function is shown as the dotted curve in figure  [ wav1 ] .",
    "this is quite strange , because it means that the short distance behaviour of the wave function will not change anymore with increasing momentum , whereas for large distances we still have an oscillation with a wavelength of @xmath516 .",
    "one can show that the limiting wave function is @xmath540 , as defined in ( [ chi - r - x ] ) .",
    "it is the @xmath150-representation of the eigenstate of @xmath63 with eigenvalue @xmath541 .",
    "hence , for small @xmath504 and large @xmath194 we have @xmath542 with @xmath535 given by ( [ r - min ] ) .",
    "let us only briefly sketch how this can be proven .",
    "if we return from the @xmath150-representation to the @xmath63-representation , then the radial wave functions are given by the bessel functions ( [ zeta - x ] ) .",
    "in the limit @xmath543 , one can show that these functions provide an approximation of the delta function @xmath544 . transforming again to the @xmath150-representation ,",
    "this implies ( [ freeze ] ) .",
    "but let us not go into any details of the proof here .",
    "numerically it can be verified easily that ( [ freeze ] ) is in fact a good approximation .",
    "what does it mean physically that the wave function freezes at small @xmath504 , and that the first maximum never goes beyond the point @xmath545 ?",
    "consider again the scattering process described by these wave functions . in case of the free particles",
    ", we can make the following statement .",
    "the larger we make the momentum of the incoming particles , the closer the particles get to each other . in other words , to probe small distances we need large momenta .",
    "this is a well known rule in elementary particle physics or actually quantum physics in general .",
    "it is one way to express heisenberg s uncertainty relation .",
    "however , this statement is no longer true when gravity is switched on .",
    "we can make the momentum as large as we like , we never get beyond the minimal distance @xmath535 .",
    "apparently , there is some repulsion that keeps the particles apart .    to see that this is a real _ quantum gravity _",
    "effect , observe that @xmath535 is of the order of the planck length , which involves both @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the effect disappears both if we switch off gravity , as then we have the wave functions of the free particles , and it also disappears in the classical limit .",
    "there is no restriction on the integration constant @xmath136 for the classical trajectories in section  [ class ] , thus the particles can reach any arbitrarily small distance .",
    "but what does it mean that the minimal distance @xmath535 depends on the quantum number @xmath195 ?",
    "first of all , one could argue that in order to bring the particles closer together we just have to consider states with smaller @xmath195 . and in fact , we have seen in figure  [ wav0 ] , that no such minimal distance exists for @xmath529 , in agreement with ( [ r - min ] ) .    but now assume that the particles are two identical fermions with masses @xmath546 .",
    "then we have @xmath547 , and consequently the minimal value of @xmath548 is @xmath549 . in this case , we have @xmath550 and this is an _ absolute _",
    "minimum for the distance , which can never be reached by any wave function .",
    "this absolute minimum only depends on the mass @xmath1 of the particles .",
    "for @xmath551 we have @xmath552 .",
    "with increasing mass it increases unboundedly . for @xmath553 , which is the maximal mass of two identical particles",
    ", the cosine goes to zero . for anyons the absolute",
    "minimum is smaller , because the minimal @xmath548 lies between zero and one , and for bosons this curious effect disappears .",
    "so , we find the following remarkable physical effect of quantum gravity . if the statistics parameter @xmath181 is different from zero , then the particles are no longer able to approach each other closer than some minimal distance , which is of the order of the planck length . but",
    "this is not the only feature of the wave functions , from which we can learn something about the short scale structure of spacetime .",
    "a second effect also results from the relation ( [ r - min ] ) , and this is even independent of the statistics . consider the wave functions for larger angular momenta , for example @xmath554 in figure  [ wav3 ] . for large @xmath504 , outside the figure , the free particle wave functions and those of the coupled particles are still of the same form , just with a phase shift , as in figure  [ wav2 ] .    [ wav3 ]    the minimal distance @xmath535 is now however five times as large as in figure  [ wav1 ] . now , suppose that we want to localize the particles relative to each other , not at the origin , but at some finite distance @xmath555 , and with some angular orientation @xmath556 .",
    "clearly , for this purpose we need a superposition of states with different quantum numbers @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "we need large quantum numbers @xmath195 to get a sharp peak in the angular orientation @xmath64 .",
    "and we need large quantum numbers @xmath194 to get a sharp peak in the distance @xmath150 .",
    "however , we have just seen that for large angular momenta @xmath195 , there is also a large minimal distance @xmath535 . and",
    "moreover , for large momenta @xmath194 the wave function freezes when the distance is of the order of this minimal distance .    roughly speaking , we can say that once we have a sharp angular direction @xmath64 of the particles , we do no longer have enough radial states to superpose , in order to get a sharp distance @xmath150 . of course",
    ", this is a somewhat heuristic argument , so let us make it more precise .",
    "consider first the following analogy .",
    "suppose that we have a box potential in flat space , which is zero outside and positive inside the box .",
    "there are then two types of energy eigenstates , those tunneling through the box , and those with sufficiently high energy passing the box without tunneling . here",
    "we have the situation that actually only the tunneling states exist , because the region @xmath557 is classically forbidden for all physical states .",
    "the physical hilbert space only consists of the tunneling states .",
    "but this subspace does not provide a complete basis of states in the position space of the system .",
    "more precisely , it is not possible to superpose the states , so that an arbitrarily sharp peak in position space comes out . to make this a little bit more explicit ,",
    "let us try to define a physical state , which describes a localized pair of particles . in case of the free particles ,",
    "there is no problem . in the schrdinger quantization",
    ", we simply have to consider the special wave function @xmath558 it can of course be written a superposition of the energy momentum eigenstates .",
    "we can even say explicitly what the corresponding wave function @xmath211 in momentum space is , which has to be inserted into ( [ rpp - sch - wave ] ) .",
    "it is @xmath559 because we have the completeness relation ( [ rpp - chi - ortho ] ) .",
    "the corresponding wave function in the dirac quantization is obtained by inserting the same wave function @xmath211 in momentum space into the formula ( [ rpp - wave - rad ] ) .",
    "the resulting wave function @xmath509 is equal to ( [ rpp - loc ] ) for @xmath560 , thus describing a localized pair of particle at a given moment of time . as this is not an energy eigenstate",
    ", the particles will of course be localized only at one moment of time .",
    "so far , this is just ordinary quantum mechanics of free particles .",
    "but now , let us ask whether such a localized state also exists for the coupled particles .",
    "are there physical states describing a localized pair of particles , with a wave function of the form ( [ rpp - loc ] ) ?",
    "we could try to insert the same wave function in momentum space ( [ mom - loc ] ) into the general superposition ( [ wave - rad ] ) of physical states . doing so , we get @xmath561 now , what about the functions @xmath513 for fixed @xmath195",
    "? do they define an orthonormal basis of the space of all radial wave function ?",
    "if this was the case , then we would immediately recover the wave function ( [ rpp - loc ] ) for @xmath560 , thus we have a localized pair of particles at that moment of time .",
    "unfortunately , however , the functions @xmath513 do not provide an orthonormal basis .",
    "this is not obvious from the representation ( [ zeta - r ] ) , but it can be seen by going back to the @xmath63-representation ( [ zeta - x ] ) .",
    "the bessel functions provide an orthonormal basis if and only if the index is fixed . for the free particles this is the case , since in ( [ rpp - zeta ] ) the index is @xmath548 .    in ( [ zeta - r ] ) , however , the index is @xmath562 , and thus not only the argument but also the index of the bessel function depends on @xmath194 .",
    "the functions @xmath563 for fixed @xmath195 in ( [ loc - no - go ] ) are not orthonormal , and therefore the resulting wave function for @xmath560 is not of the form ( [ rpp - loc ] ) , describing a localized state .",
    "now , one could argue that there might be another superposition of physical states describing a localized pair of particles .",
    "however , if there were such localized states , then we could use them as a basis of the physical hilbert space , and this would be exactly the basis that we defined in the beginning of this section , when we tried to set up a schrdinger quantization .",
    "we saw , however , that due to the global structure of the classical phase space such a basis does not exist .",
    "so , what is the conclusion ? obviously , the spacetime in which the quantized particles are moving has some kind of _ foamy _ structure .",
    "maybe it is possible to analyze this structure more explicitly , by having a closer look at the wave functions @xmath513 . for a single particle system ,",
    "such an analysis has been carried out in some detail in @xcite , finding a semi - discrete structure of spacetime and an explicit uncertainty relation , which forbids the particle to be localized . here",
    "things are more involved and therefore it is more difficult to make the idea of a foamy spacetime more precise . but at least we can see that it is impossible to localize the particles at a point in space , and this is already a nice result .",
    "it gives us a hint to what kind of influence a real theory of quantum gravity might have on the local structure of spacetime in general .",
    "finally , let us consider yet another strange result , which has actually not very much to do with the point particles .",
    "there is quantized conical geometry of the spacetime at spatial infinity .",
    "let us once again look at the spinning cone ( [ spin - cone ] ) .",
    "it defines the asymptotic structure of the spacetime at infinity .",
    "we saw that it has the following global geometric features .",
    "there is a deficit angle of @xmath275 , and a time offset of @xmath274 .",
    "now , consider the energy momentum eigenstates spanning the physical hilbert space .",
    "they are the eigenstates of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with eigenvalues @xmath564 for simplicity , we assumed that the particles are massless , distinguishable , and that the statistics parameter is @xmath565 .",
    "there is nothing essentially different in a more general case , except that the formulas below are slightly different . in the context of quantized general relativity , the energy momentum eigenstates can also be regarded as states with a _ sharp geometry _ of the spacetime at infinity , but with the locations of the particles in space smeared out . however , the geometry of the spinning cone is thereby not arbitrary .",
    "there is an obvious relation between the eigenvalues of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , namely @xmath566 as this results from the quantization of the canonical angular momentum @xmath394 , we expect that this is a general result , which does not depend , for example , on the number of particles present . in fact , one can show that for a general multi particle model there is the same relation between the canonical angular momentum @xmath394 and the parameters of the spinning cone @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the same is expected for any kind of matter included @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that the geometry of the conical infinity itself is quantized . just like in a quantized atom , where not every classically allowed combination of energy and angular momentum can be realized ,",
    "the conical geometry of the spacetime at infinity is restricted by this quantum condition .",
    "it becomes a very simple relation when it is written in geometric units , that is lengths and angles .",
    "we define the total angle of the spinning cone to be @xmath567 .",
    "it is the circumference of a unit circle around the central axis .",
    "and we define the time offset to be @xmath568 .",
    "then the quantization condition becomes @xmath569 only those conical spacetimes can be realized where the product of the total angle and the time offset is an integer multiple of @xmath570 .",
    "note that @xmath571 is dimensionless and @xmath215 is a length , or time , so that necessarily the planck length shows up . if @xmath571 is close to @xmath9 , then @xmath215 is quantized is units of @xmath572 , which is a kind of time quantization .",
    "if we assume that this result is independent of the kind of matter being present inside the universe , then what we have found is a real _ quantization of geometry_.",
    "for helpful discussions and hospitality we would like to thank ingemar bengtsson , sren holst , and hermann nicolai .",
    "here we summarize some facts about the spinor representation of the three dimensional lorentz algebra @xmath14 of traceless @xmath573 matrices , and the associated lie group @xmath328 .",
    "a more comprehensive collection of formulas , using the same notation , can be found in @xcite . as a vector space , @xmath14 is isometric to three dimensional minkowski space .",
    "an orthonormal basis is given by the gamma matrices @xmath574 they satisfy the algebra @xmath575 where @xmath576 , the metric @xmath577 has signature @xmath578 , and for the levi civita symbol @xmath579 we have @xmath580 . expanding a generic matrix in terms of these gamma matrices",
    ", we obtain an isomorphism of @xmath14 and minkowski space , @xmath581 some useful relations are that the scalar product of two vectors is equal to the trace norm of the corresponding matrices , and the vector product is essentially given by the matrix commutator , @xmath582 = - { \\varepsilon}^{abc } \\ , v_a w_b \\ , { \\bgamma}_c.\\ ] ] sometimes it is useful to introduce cylindrical coordinates in minkowski space , writing @xmath583 where @xmath215 and @xmath584 are real , and @xmath585 is an angular direction .",
    "the vector @xmath586 and its derivative @xmath587 form a rotated set of spacelike unit vectors , pointing into the direction of @xmath585 and the orthogonal direction , @xmath588 useful relations are @xmath589 and @xmath590 the lie group @xmath328 consists of matrices @xmath591 with unit determinant .",
    "the group acts on the algebra in the adjoint representation , so that @xmath592 this provides a proper lorentz rotation of the vector @xmath593 .",
