    "we use a pre - computed database of 46800 synthetic flux and polarization spectra for field strengths of 1400 mg and a wide range of effective temperatures to generate synthetic zeeman spectra , which we subject to an automatic optimization scheme with the aim to recover the parameters describing the original magnetic field configuration .",
    "we adopt input field geometries which involve the sum of non - aligned dipole and quadrupole components .",
    "we also provide for off - centre shifts of the configuration . by adding gaussian noise we create input spectra with and 20 , respectively .",
    "= 0.80    off - centred dipole - quadrupole combinations are reliably recovered even for by our code , which can handle up to 12 free parameters but becomes inefficient if higher multipoles are included .",
    "the poor convergence is caused by the complexity of the @xmath0-landscape , which develops an increasing number of secondary minima for more complex field geometries ( for a detailed investigation , see euchner et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "we find that a given set of phase - resolved zeeman spectra can be reproduced within the noise by quite different formal representations of the field , which , however , all seem to describe rather similar actual field geometries",
    ". we are confident , therefore , that observed phase - resolved zeeman spectra can provide quite definite information on the field structure .",
    "= 0.85    the magnetic field structure over the surface of accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic binaries becomes accessible to observation only in states of low or switched - off accretion .",
    "following the first detection of zeeman lines in the polar eferidani ( @xmath1 = 81 min ) by wheatley & ramsay ( 1998 ) , we obtained phase - resolved flux and circular polarization spectra of this object with fors1 at the eso vlt on 22 nov 2000 .",
    "fig.1 shows the spectra collected in four almost equal phase bins after removal of a slight rotational temperature variation .",
    "there is no obvious variation of the zeeman structures with phase .",
    "fits of inclined multipole field models with the angle @xmath2 between magnetic and rotational axis left free yielded .",
    "the lack of phase dependence of the zeeman features further suggests that the tesseral / sectoral multipole components are weak .",
    "we fitted the mean flux and polarization spectra , therefore , with an expansion including only the zonal components up to a maximum degree .",
    "fig.2 shows the dipole+quadrupole fit , which is substantially better than the pure dipole ( not shown ) .",
    "fig.3 depicts the result for the expansion up to .",
    "the dipole is replaced by large coefficients for the higher - order multipole components which substantially improve the fit . while the higher - order multipole fit accounts for many of the observed details  all the wiggles in the blue are genuine zeeman features ",
    "there are still noticeable discrepancies : ( i ) the observed lack of circular polarization around 5700  requires that a larger fraction of the field occurs at negative @xmath3 ( angle between line of sight and field direction ) , and ( ii ) the observed narrow spectral feature at 5120  can be fitted by additional field contributions with @xmath4 between 60 and 100 mg pointing away from the observer , possibly generated by a steeper rise of @xmath4 towards the lower ( unseen ) pole than provided by the model ."
