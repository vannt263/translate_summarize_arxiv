    "although there exists an abundance of evidence at many different energy and length scales that the vast majority of matter in our universe is non - baryonic and does not possess significant electromagnetic interactions , the nature of this dark matter remains unknown .",
    "understanding the particle nature of dark matter is one of the most important outstanding problems in both cosmology and particle physics .",
    "there are currently numerous direct detection experiments searching for interactions between the dark matter particles and the nuclei of the detectors .",
    "the dama experiment is the first direct detection experiment to make a claim of the detection of particle dark matter . for more than a decade ,",
    "the dama / libra collaboration ( and its predecessor dama / nai ) have claimed detection of an annual modulation that they associate with dark matter interacting with the nai crystals of their detectors @xcite .",
    "the dama annual modulation is currently reported as nearly a 9@xmath1 effect @xcite , and is consistent with a @xmath070 or @xmath010  gev wimp elastically scattering predominantly off of iodine or sodium , respectively  @xcite .",
    "hints of light dark matter may now be evident at other experiments , as well . in february of 2010 ,",
    "the cogent collaboration reported an excess of scattering events at low energy  @xcite .",
    "the collaboration subsequently reported 2.8@xmath1 evidence for an annual modulation in these excess events  @xcite . at the same conference , cresst - ii also announced events above their known backgrounds that can be interpreted as evidence for light dark matter  @xcite .",
    "whether dama , cogent , and cresst are consistent in the low - mass window is still debated  @xcite .    to complicate the matter even further",
    ", cdms has not observed an annual modulation in their germanium detectors  @xcite , although they have not yet released results with an energy threshold low enough to be sensitive to the entire energy range for the dama modulation .",
    "in addition , cdms @xcite and both xenon10  @xcite and xenon100  @xcite find null results at low energies that appear to be in conflict with the three experiments that report anomalies .",
    "the very recent development of three events observed in the signal window of the silicon detectors of cdms  @xcite has only increased the interest ( and confusion ) in the low mass region .",
    "the cdms result is even more intriguing given that the mass and cross section consistent with the dark matter interpretation of the three events lands in the same area of parameter space as that indicated by the cogent excess , accounting for the latter s updated estimates for surface event contamination  @xcite .",

    "all of the photo - multiplier tubes ( pmt s ) in the dama / libra experiment were replaced by high quantum efficiency pmt s  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of this detector upgrade is the anticipated lowering of the energy threshold from 2  kevee down to 1  kevee . in this paper",
    "we will examine the extent to which dama s lower energy threshold can help to clarify the currently confusing situation for light dark matter .",
    "we will start by reviewing the basics of direct detection in section  [ sec : detection ] , followed by a discussion of the dama experiment and results in section  [ sec : dama ] .",

    "thus , in the shm , the earth s motion will lead to a sinusoidal modulation of the signal in a dark matter detector .",
    "in this section , we discuss the dama experimental setup and current results .",
    "we also address two issues affecting the interpretation of these results : the choice of binning for the data and uncertainties in the quenching factor used to calibrate the energy scale of events in the dama detectors .",
    "the dama / libra collaboration uses 25 highly radio - pure nai(tl ) detectors with a total target mass of @xmath0250 kg . each detector is instrumented with pmt s that measure the scintillation light created by a nuclear recoil ; these pmt s have been recently upgraded  @xcite .",
    "the collaboration uses gamma ray sources for calibrating their detectors that produce scintillation light through _ electron _ recoils .",
    "this means that the energy of a nuclear recoil will be measured in electron equivalent energy , or kevee .",
    "the electron equivalent energy , @xmath57 , is related to the nuclear recoil energy , @xmath58 , via what is termed the `` quenching factor . '' for the dama detectors , the quenching factor , @xmath59 , is the ratio of the amount of scintillation light created by a recoiling nucleus of some kinetic energy to that created by a recoiling electron of the same kinetic energy , i.e.  @xmath60 .",
    "measuring the value of the quenching factor for sodium at the low energies relevant for light wimps is quite difficult .",
    "this has led to some uncertainty as to the value and possible energy dependence of the quenching factor ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in our work",
    ", we adopt the values of the dama collaboration , @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for quenching factor measurements of nai and several other scintillators used in direct detection experiments ) .",
    "broadly speaking , increasing the quenching factor will shift an allowed region in the ( mass , cross section ) plane towards lower masses while leaving the cross section values relatively unaffected ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "every real detector has both an energy resolution and a detection efficiency for relevant events .",
    "we implement these effects for the dama / libra detectors using @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is the event detection efficiency and @xmath65 is the differential response function , defined such that @xmath66 is the probability that a nuclear recoil of energy @xmath58 will produce a scintillation signal measured between @xmath57 and @xmath67 ( in the limit of small @xmath68 ) .",
    "the energy resolution for the detectors with the original pmt s at the energies of interest is given by  @xcite @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the collaboration presents an efficiency corrected spectrum , so we can safely use @xmath72 . although most of the upgraded detectors do show a small improvement in resolution at higher energies  @xcite there is no updated information available about their resolution in the low energy region .",
    "we will thus use eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : sigmaer ] ) to implement the detector resolution .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , due to the changing wimp velocity distribution at earth as the earth orbits the sun , there is a small ( @xmath0 1 - 10% ) variation ( or modulation ) in the recoil rate throughout the year @xcite .",
    "the recoil rate can be described as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the average rate , @xmath75 is the modulation amplitude , and higher order terms are often negligible ( but see the discussion below ) .",
    "note that @xmath75 can be negative , though this can only occur at low energies .",
    "most direct detection experiments search for a non - modulating signal of nuclear recoil due to dark matter scattering , i.e.  that due to @xmath74 .",
    "these detectors have typically been smaller in fiducial volume relative to dama and must be very good at background rejection .",
    "the strategy of the dama collaboration is unique in that they are looking for the modulation amplitude , @xmath75 , induced by dark matter scattering .",
    "their detectors have unknown , but presumably non - modulating , backgrounds , providing a natural background rejection strategy . as discussed previously ,",
    "the modulation amplitude is smaller than @xmath74 , however , so larger detector masses and exposure are required .",
    "many modulating backgrounds have been put forward as alternative explanations for the dama modulation including : detector systematics , muons and fast neutrons produced by muons , environmental neutrons , nuclear decays in the detector , and many others .",
    "the collaboration has thus far rejected each of these possibilities as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the higher order terms in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : drdes ] ) are usually negligible , but may become important in some cases .",
    "one case is in the presence of a dark matter cold flow ( e.g.  a tidal stream ) , where the modulation can become very non - sinusoidal @xcite .",
    "another case is for energies corresponding to the high velocity tail of the shm , where the modulation becomes more sharply peaked around @xmath55 . in both cases ,",
    "the amplitude of higher order terms may become comparable to @xmath75 .",
    "however , any significant cold flow would likely change the phase of the modulation from the shm expected june  2 , whereas the dama observed modulation ( may  26 @xmath43 7  days ) is consistent with the shm .",
    "additionally , the dama modulation is also observed over a broad range of energies ( @xmath025  kevee ) , which corresponds to a broad range of @xmath76 and not just the tail of the distribution . for these reasons",
    ", a dama analysis can still be safely performed when neglecting higher order terms in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : drdes ] ) . in any case",
    ", the dama modulation amplitude determination essentially identifies the first order fourier expansion coefficient whether or not higher order terms are significant . in this case , a valid analysis can always be performed , even if the modulation is non - sinusoidal , as long as the predicted rates are fourier expanded using the same phase as the experimental determination ( though `` modulation amplitude '' may lose its meaning ) .",
    "dama modulation amplitude results are presented in 36 bins , all 0.5  kevee wide , over 220  kevee @xcite .",
    "measurements over the lower part of this energy range , along with their uncertainties , are shown in figure  [ fig : data ] ( orange boxes ) .",
    "an alternative binning used in this analysis , where some of the original bins have been combined ( gray boxes ) , will be discussed below .",
    "these amplitudes have been determined assuming the shm expected phase ( @xmath55 , the time of year at which earth moves fastest relative to the dark matter halo ) of june  2 ; the best - fit dama phase is may  26 @xmath43 7 days , consistent with this number .",
    "constraints on wimp parameters and goodness - of - fit tests are based upon the chi - square , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the modulation amplitude measurement in bin @xmath79 ( averaged over energy ) , @xmath80 is the measurement uncertainty , @xmath81 is the theoretically expected amplitude for a wimp mass @xmath3 and scattering cross - section(s ) @xmath82 , and the sum is over all bins . in most cases",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the wimp parameter space containing only the mass and si cross - section , though we will also consider the case of sd couplings .",
    "we test the goodness - of - fit of the wimp framework to the data by minimizing the @xmath83 over the wimp parameter space ; the resulting @xmath84 should follow a @xmath83 distribution with degrees of freedom ( _ dof _ ) equal to the number of data bins less the number of parameters minimized over . in the case of si - only scattering ,",
    "the @xmath83 is minimized at @xmath85  gev and @xmath86  pb , with @xmath87 .",
    "this @xmath84 has a @xmath88-value of 0.44 in the expected @xmath83 distribution and , thus , the data are consistent with a wimp with si interactions . a second",
    ", local @xmath83 minimum is found at @xmath89  gev and @xmath90  pb with @xmath91 , also a good fit to the data .",
    "the global ( solid orange ) and local ( dashed orange ) best - fit spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : data ] ( both curves are obscured by black curves of the same style ) .",
    "while both spectra are a reasonable fit to the current data , they exhibit very different behavior below the current threshold of 2  kevee , hence the interest in a lower threshold analysis , which would allow the two cases to be distinguished .",
    "the two spectra differ in that , over the current energy range of 220  kevee , the 68  gev spectrum is primarily due to scattering of wimps on iodine nuclei , while the 10  gev spectrum is primarily due to scattering on sodium nuclei . in both cases , there are far more iodine scatters than sodium scatters ; however , in the latter case , those iodine recoils are nearly all below threshold .",
    "the relatively large number of expected iodine scatters is apparent in the rapid increase in the amplitude below 2  kevee .",
    "confidence regions are determined using @xmath92 .",
    "in a two parameter space , such as the case of a wimp with si - only interactions ( where @xmath3 and @xmath93 are the two parameters ) , the confidence regions at a 90%/3@xmath1/5@xmath1 confidence level ( cl ) are defined as the parameters such that @xmath94  4.61/11.83/28.74 .    a brief",
    "aside on the use of regions in comparing experimental results is given here .",
    "due to the various potential positive signals seen in some experiments ( dama @xcite , cogent @xcite , cresst @xcite , and cdms silicon @xcite ) and the lack of signal in others ( xenon10 @xcite , xenon100 @xcite and cdms germanium @xcite ) , the question often arises of whether these experimental results are compatible with each other in particular wimp frameworks ( e.g.  si scattering assuming the shm ) .",
    "ideally , such a question can be answered by performing a joint likelihood analysis . in practice , with very different statistics used to produce constraints for different experimental results ,",
    "such an analysis proves difficult to perform",
    ". instead , compatibility is often approximately determined by plotting a separately derived allowed or excluded region for each experimental result and looking for regions in parameter space consistent with all of the individual experimental constraints .",
    "the question of whether there are parameters for which all experimental results are compatible is inherently a goodness - of - fit question , of which a @xmath95 confidence region alone can not provide an answer .",
    "the goodness - of - fit is determined separately from the @xmath84 value , and a @xmath95 confidence region may contain parameters that are a very poor fit to the data if the @xmath84 is poor .    an alternative method for examining compatibility",
    "is to identify parameter ranges that give a reasonable @xmath83 . in the case of 36 bins ,",
    "those regions at the 90%/3@xmath1/5@xmath1  cl are defined by @xmath96  47.2/64.1/93.2 ; see figure  [ fig : sigmam ] for these regions in the case of si - only scattering",
    ". we will refer to these as `` goodness - of - fit '' regions and the @xmath95 regions as confidence regions ( though , strictly speaking , the former are also technically confidence regions ) .",
    "the latter has better properties desired in confidence regions , regions tend to be smaller than the @xmath83 goodness - of - fit regions , i.e.  the former statistic is more powerful at rejecting incorrect parameter values . ]",
    "so it is preferable to use when confidence regions are wanted . for issues of compatibility",
    ", only the goodness - of - fit regions can be appropriately interpreted in the manner often desired , and overlap of such regions is a better indicator of what the ideal joint likelihood analysis would produce . for a brief review of statistics ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to the modulation , dama measures the average total ( signal plus background ) rate in their detector @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the background rate  @xcite . as the background rate is unknown , dama can not explicitly determine @xmath74 ; however , an upper limit can be placed : @xmath99 .",

    "while not entirely excluding either of the two mass regions in figure  [ fig : sigmam ] , the constraint placed on @xmath74 does create some tension in the higher mass region as some of this region ( including the best - fit point ) would result in the signal rate alone exceeding the measured total rate.80  gev to @xmath070  gev and to a lower cross - section , relaxing that tension somewhat . ] as a statistical analysis that combines both the dama modulation and total rate data is rather difficult ( due to the unknown background ) , we shall consider only the modulation data for the remainder of the paper , though this tension should be kept in mind .      .",

    "this is as expected since the spectra , and thus data , substantially differ below 2  kevee , even though they were similar above 2  kevee . for these particular models , the opposite mass region ( e.g.  the light mass region for model  1 , the high mass wimp case )",
    "is excluded at at least the 5@xmath1 cl .",
    "this suggests that , if the dama signal is due to a wimp , low - energy data will almost certainly be able to unambiguously determine if it is a light or heavy wimp ; we shall shortly provide rigorous proof of this .",
    "our phenomenological model  3 also identifies only a single mass region , being most consistent with a heavier wimp mass , though the low - energy data falls somewhere between the high- and low - mass wimp scenarios .    the previous results , based only on one set of pseudo - data each for three specific spectral models , raises two questions .",
    "first , given that model  3 data was generated from an arbitrary ( non - wimp ) spectrum but was still consistent with a wimp interpretation , are there low - energy measurements that could not be reasonably interpreted as due to wimps ?",
    "second , as discussed already for the single bin analysis , assuming the data is consistent with a wimp , will the low - energy measurements _ always _ distinguish between a light and heavy wimp mass as was the case in our three examples ?    to address these questions ,",
    "we have scanned over all possible modulation amplitude measurements in the two low - energy bins . for simplicity",
    ", we have taken the measurement uncertainties in these two bins to be equal to that of model  1 , the model with the largest uncertainties .",
    "for each set of amplitude measurements , we minimize the @xmath83 of the full data set ( two new low - energy bins plus the existing data ) over si - only scattering wimps with either light ( 520  gev ) or heavy ( 25100  gev ) masses and determine the goodness - of - fit for the @xmath84 .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig : massscan ] .",
    "for each set of amplitude measurements within a contour , there exists at least one set of wimp parameters within one of the two mass ranges that is not excluded at the given cl by the goodness - of - fit . outside of the contour , _ all _ wimps over the corresponding mass range",
    "would be excluded by at least the given cl .",
    "contours are shown at the @xmath117 cls for both mass ranges , except there is no 1@xmath1 contour for the light wimp case as no set of low - energy measurements will be consistent with a light wimp at the 1@xmath1 level .",
    "the low - mass compatible contours extend up to @xmath00.40.7  cpd / kg / kevee .",
    "the high mass contours ( blue ) indicate that the low - energy amplitude measurements can be either positive or negative and still be consistent with a heavier wimp , though the amplitudes should not be too large .",
    "thus , dama will not necessarily see the actual phase reversal over 12  kevee even if the signal is due to a heavy wimp . on the other hand",
    ", both measurements must be positive to be compatible with a light wimp at better than the 3@xmath1 level .",
    "for the low - mass case , the amplitude of the first bin can be quite large , though the amplitude of the second bin should not be substantially larger than the existing @xmath118  kevee measurements .",
    "comparison of the two sets of contours shows that there is no set of measurements for which one of the two mass ranges will not be excluded at at least the 2.6@xmath1 level , indicating that dama will _",
    "always _ be able to distinguish between the two mass regions , at least at a moderate level .",
    "this is a mild improvement over the minimum exclusion level of 2.3@xmath1 for a single 12  kevee bin , though there are many two - bin measurements that would be excluded at a far higher level than with only the equivalent single - bin measurement .",
    "as we have chosen to use the larger uncertainties expected of a heavy wimp ( model  1 ) rather than the smaller uncertainties more likely for the light wimp , the low - mass compatible regions might be overstated and the expected distinction between high and low mass wimps could be even stronger .    up to this point , we have examined wimps with only si interactions . in table",
    "[ tab : fits ] , we address the possibilities of sd and mixed si / sd interactions by showing best - fit parameters to the existing dama data and to the pseudo - data of our three models for a variety of coupling scenarios . for the existing dama data ,",
    "one finds good fits in both the low and high mass regions for all the different coupling combinations considered ( except for the high mass case with sd proton - only scattering ) , with the lighter mass slightly preferred for sd couplings and the heavier mass slightly preferred for si and mixed si / sd couplings . in other words",
    ", the current dama modulation results do not prefer any particular coupling type .",
    "the situation is remarkably different when the low - energy data in our models is included . for models  1 and  2 ,",
    "the fits are substantially poorer ( relative to the si case ) in the cases of sd proton - only or sd neutron - only couplings , the two cases often used to show direct detection constraints for sd scattering .",
    "when both sd couplings are allowed to vary , model  2 once again finds a set of wimp parameters that are consistent with the data .",
    "thus , caution should be used when trying to compare experimental results in the context of sd scattering in the future as the customary sd scattering scenarios ( proton - only or neutron - only ) may fail to give the full picture . for model  3",
    ", sd scattering gives an improvement in the fits over the si case .",
    "the best - fit mixed sd coupling case gives a spectrum as shown by the green dashed curve in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : le ] .",
    "the significant decrease in the @xmath83 suggests that this sd spectrum is preferred to the si spectrum ( solid green ) , though quantifying the level to which sd is preferred requires a statistical analysis beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "while the previous examined sd scattering for only three particular pseudo results , the general sd case is shown in figure  [ fig : couplingscan ] .",
    "the red ( blue ) contours indicate measurements for which at least one wimp mass and sd proton - only ( neutron - only ) cross - section is compatible with the data at the 90%/3@xmath1  cl , again assuming the same uncertainties as in model  1 .",
    "the filled purple regions indicate the same compatibility , but allowing for an arbitrary set of mixed sd couplings . for comparison ,",
    "the si - only case is shown by the thin black contours ; these contours allow for an arbitrary wimp mass , so they contain both the low - mass and high - mass regions shown separately in figure  [ fig : massscan ] .",
    "all four 90%  cl regions overlap in an area of the figure where the new measurements are positive but comparable or smaller in magnitude than the current 23  kevee measurement of @xmath0  0.02  cpd / kg / kevee . for measurements in this area",
    ", dama will be unable to exclude any type of si or sd coupling .",
    "however , there are measurements , notably for some negative values , for which si scattering is consistent , but all sd scattering is excluded ; measurements here will thus be able to identify the type of coupling .",
    "on the other hand , measurements consistent with sd proton - only or sd neutron - only scattering will generally also be consistent with si scattering .",
    "only the sd mixed coupling case allows for measurements inconsistent with si scattering , primarily at very high amplitudes for the 1.01.5  kevee bin with small , positive amplitudes for the 1.52.0  kevee bin .",
    "one interesting feature of this plot is that the sd proton - only contours encompass only a relatively small region , meaning this particular coupling scenario could very easily be fully excluded by future low - energy dama measurements .",
    "it is clear that the lower threshold may allow dama to distinguish between si or sd interactions as the source of their modulation , although not to a high significance level .",
    "the reason why this may be possible is that the relative contributions to the scattering from sodium and iodine are different under the different couplings .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the model  2 si spectrum with the model  3 sd spectrum in figure  [ fig : le ] .",
    "these two spectra occur at nearly identical wimp masses ( 10.2 vs.  9.9  gev ) .",
    "the _ shape _ of each nucleus contribution to the modulation spectrum is similar in both cases , but the _ amplitudes _ greatly differ .",
    "most of the events above 2  kevee are due to sodium recoils and , thus , the spectra at those energies are similar .",
    "the iodine recoils occur mainly below 2  kevee but , having fixed the appropriate cross - sections to get the sodium scatters to match the data above 2  kevee , the total iodine scattering rates differ by @xmath119 in the two cases , with si interactions giving a much larger iodine scattering rate .",
    "the result is that the contribution from iodine dominates over that from sodium at @xmath02  kevee in the si case , but not until a much lower @xmath01  kevee in the sd case",
    ".    while there are regions in figure  [ fig : couplingscan ] that indicate only one of si or sd couplings is compatible , in which case the data will clearly identify which coupling type is responsible for the dama modulation , there are regions where both si and sd couplings are compatible , in which case the type of coupling producing the signal may be less apparent .",
    "however , even if a measurement is compatible with both coupling types , a hypothesis test may still indicate a strong preference for one coupling type over another . as neither of the si and sd parameter spaces is a subset of the other , the simple likelihood ratio hypothesis test is inapplicable here .",
    "hypothesis tests appropriate for this analysis are more difficult to implement and computationally intensive and , as such , are not performed here .",
    "figure  [ fig : couplingscan ] shows that there are low - energy dama measurements for which neither si nor sd couplings would provide a good fit .",
    "thus , new measurements could rule out the dark matter interpretation of the dama modulation , at least for the standard case considered here ( non - standard wimps , such as velocity - dependent or momentum - dependent wimps , might still be of interest ; see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , one or both new low - energy bin amplitude measurements must substantially differ from the existing @xmath120  kevee measurements . a background that provides a modulation amplitude that does not rapidly change as the threshold is lowered is unlikely to produce results incompatible with a dark matter interpretation .",
    "finally , we have shown that the low and high mass wimp cases will be clearly distinguished for si scattering .",
    "does the same hold true for sd interactions ?",
    "figure  [ fig : couplingscan ] does not directly answer that question as contours are not shown separately for the two mass ranges as was the case for si scattering in figure  [ fig : massscan ] .",
    "there is some indication from the sd neutron - only 90%  cl contour that the two mass possibilities may be distinguished in the sd case as well : this contour is nearly separated into two regions , with the left region measurements that are best fit by light wimps and the right region measurements that are best fit by heavy wimps ( here , again , light and heavy refer to @xmath010 and @xmath070  gev ) . by performing separate low and high mass scans",
    ", we find that , for sd neutron - only interactions , at least one of the two mass ranges will be excluded at minimum at the 89%  cl .",
    "the sd proton - only case has _ already _ broken the mass degeneracy : even without new low - energy measurements , the high mass scenario is excluded at the 4@xmath1  cl , while a low mass wimp is a good fit to the existing data .",
    "that remains unchanged with a lower threshold , which is why the sd proton - only region is so small compared to other couplings in figure  [ fig : couplingscan ] .",
    "the two masses can not be generically expected to be distinguished in the sd mixed coupling case as there are measurements for which both masses provide very good fits .",
    "keep in mind , however , that this is a worst case scenario . while it is _ possible",
    "_ to have measurements that are good fits to both mass ranges , it is likely that the measurements will result in a poor fit for one of the two masses .",
    "for example , the measurements that provide the best low ( high ) mass fit will exclude the high ( low ) mass region at the 3.4@xmath1 ( 2.9@xmath1 )  cl . furthermore , recall that these calculations use conservative error estimates , so the ability to distinguish the low and high mass regions may be stronger .",
    "recent interest in light dark matter has increased significantly due to excess events observed in the cogent , cresst , and cdms experiments .",
    "the anomalies in each of these experiments have been interpreted as evidence for spin - independent , elastic scattering of low mass wimps . although the cross section implied by the dama modulation is larger than that indicated by the other experiments , it is very intriguing that they are all pointing towards a similar mass range .",
    "assuming similar sized error bars , we find this low mass dark matter interpretation of the dama modulation would require the amplitude in a single energy bin from 12  kevee to be above 0.026  cpd / kg / kevee at @xmath121 , which is larger than the signal measured in any bin thus far . at the 90% level , this lower limit would grow to 0.046  cpd / kg / kevee , or nearly twice the size of any of the values measured thus far .    additionally ,",
    "even with only a single bin from 12  kevee , the degeneracy between the low mass and high mass regions will be removed at a minimum 90% confidence level no matter what value is measured .",
    "if the measured value is closer to one of the best - fit points in the low or high mass region , then the exclusion of the other region would grow considerably , to greater than @xmath121 . if the data is reported using 2 bins from 12  kevee ( as expected by the current binning scheme ) , even with conservative estimates for the uncertainties , this degeneracy will by removed at by at least the @xmath122 level . again , if the measured values are closer to one of the best - fit points in the low or high mass regions , then the exclusion level of the other region would strengthen to greater than @xmath123 .",
    "the ability to discriminate so strongly between the two masses has been made possible by selecting a binning scheme that improves the dama @xmath83 goodness - of - fit test , as discussed in section  [ sec : binning ] .",
    "we used the shm in our analysis but our results are qualitatively robust against different assumptions regarding the velocity distribution of the diffuse dark matter halo .",
    "any ( plausible ) halo distribution must be able fit the existing dama modulation results , which is possible in two cases : a heavier wimp where iodine recoils dominate the 25  kevee signal region , and a lighter wimp where sodium recoils dominate this signal region . in the latter case , a large iodine signal is unavoidably present somewhere below the 2  kevee threshold , particularly with the @xmath28 enhancement in si scattering . this iodine signal should become apparent when the dama threshold is lowered , providing a means to discriminate between the two mass regions .",
    "this qualitative picture should hold for any reasonable background halo distribution ; only the quantitative picture should differ ( though the two mass regions are unlikely to stray far from the @xmath010  gev and @xmath070  gev regions of the shm ) .",
    "although this work focused on the dama / libra data , several features are very relevant to any direct detection experiment seeking to measure the annual modulation . for a detector with a single element , lowering",
    "the threshold into the region where the modulation spectrum turns over and becomes negative would be very strong evidence for the dark matter interpretation of the data .",
    "it is quite difficult to imagine a background with a spectrum that undergoes such a phase reversal . for a detector with more than one element",
    ", there will always be a degeneracy at higher energies between lighter wimps primarily scattering from the lighter element(s ) and heavier wimps primarily scattering from the heavier element(s ) .",
    "this effect can be observed with the unmodulated signal ( as in the cresst regions ) or in the modulation signal ( as in the dama / libra regions ) .",
    "once the energy threshold is lowered far enough , however , these two scenarios make very different predictions about the behavior of the annual modulation signal .",
    "the annual modulation signal thus provides the opportunity to break the degeneracy between the low and high mass regions .",
    "furthermore , since the relative scattering contribution from each nucleus differs between si and sd couplings , the modulation signal might also discriminate between these two coupling possibilities with a sufficiently low threshold .",

    "<S> the dama experiment searches for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter via its expected but rare interactions within the detector , where the interaction rates will modulate throughout the year due to the orbital motion of the earth . over the course of more than 10 years of operation </S>",
    "<S> , dama has indeed detected a strong modulation in the event rate above the detector threshold of 2  kevee . under standard assumptions regarding the dark matter halo and wimp interactions , this signal is consistent with that expected of wimps of two different approximate masses : @xmath010  gev and @xmath070  gev . </S>",
    "<S> we examine how a lower threshold , allowed by recent upgrades to the dama detector , may shed light on this situation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the lower threshold data should rule out one of the two mass ranges for spin - independent couplings ( in the worst case , disfavoring one of the masses by still more than 2.6@xmath1 ) and is likely , though not certain , to do the same for spin - dependent couplings . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the data may indicate whether the interaction is predominantly spin - independent or spin - dependent in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> our findings illustrate the importance of a low threshold in modulation searches .    </S>",
