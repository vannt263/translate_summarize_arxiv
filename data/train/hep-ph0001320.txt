    "the possible existence of extra dimensions has been a fascinating idea in physics ever since kaluza - klein theory was proposed @xcite .",
    "consistent string theories demand the existence of extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , if the string scale ( @xmath5 ) is as high as the grand unification scale ( @xmath10 gev ) or the planck scale ( @xmath11 gev ) , as is the case for a weakly coupled heterotic string , then the length scale of the compactified extra dimensions @xmath12 would be too small to be appreciable experimentally .",
    "recent developments in string theory indicate that the string scale can be much lower than the planck scale and even close to the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "this possibility provides new avenues towards many theoretical issues such as alternative solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite , fermion mass and flavor mixings @xcite , and new inflationary cosmological models @xcite .",
    "more importantly , such a scenario may lead to a rich phenomenology and is thus experimentally testable at low energies @xcite .",
    "assume that there are @xmath13 extra dimensions in which only gravity can propagate while standard model ( sm ) fields are confined to four dimensional spacetime .",
    "the large value of the planck scale can be understood by gauss law from the relation @xmath14 where the string scale @xmath5 is taken to be the planck mass in @xmath0 dimensions . for",
    ", @xmath15 can range from 1 fm to 1 mm for @xmath16 to 2 @xcite .",
    "there are no direct gravitational tests sensitive to those small scales yet @xcite .",
    "such large extra dimensions manifest themselves only through interactions involving the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the gravitons with enhanced coupling strength after summing over the many contributing light kk states . the effective theory governing the graviton couplings to matter",
    "was described in @xcite .",
    "phenomenological studies showed that future collider experiments can provide constraints on @xmath5 typically of order , depending on the collider center of mass energies @xcite .",
    "astrophysical ( cosmological ) considerations have been used to impose lower bounds on @xmath5 to be about 30 ( 100 ) tev for @xmath7 and very weak bounds for higher dimensions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider radiative corrections to the masses of the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath17 arising from the exchange of massive spin-2 kk gravitons .",
    "the motivation for this study is two - fold .",
    "firstly , a rigorously renormalizable theory of gravity does not exist",
    ". it would be interesting to explore to what extent the formalism in ref .",
    "@xcite is finite against radiative corrections in the sense of an effective field theory .",
    "an early attempt in ref .",
    "@xcite for a scalar self - energy correction showed that the radiative corrections are proportional to the scalar mass , instead of the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "another one - loop calculation for the muon @xmath18 also reached finite results @xcite . secondly ,",
    "if one is able to compute radiative effects from kk gravitons , one may hope to examine constraints on new physics characterized by the string scale from precision electroweak measurements .",
    "in fact , a recent paper appeared to estimate the @xmath19 parameter @xcite , which was found to be both ultraviolet and infrared divergent .",
    "however , our results arrive at completely different conclusions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we compute one - loop self - energy diagrams for a gauge boson from exchange of massive spin-2 kk gravitons . to do so",
    ", we need to derive the four  point couplings of two gravitons and two gauge bosons which are beyond that given in ref .",
    "@xcite and have been left out in the previous calculations @xcite . in section iii",
    "we adopt the @xmath1-formalism @xcite and constrain the string scale based on current experimental values of the oblique parameters .",
    "computing oblique parameters has an advantage over calculating @xmath20 mass corrections directly since they are free of certain technical and conceptual uncertainties .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude in section iv . in two appendices we present the relevant feynman rules and describe the regularization of the infrared divergences .",
    "when the typical energy scale of interest is much smaller than the string scale @xmath5 , the compactified higher dimensional theory can be described by an effective theory where only relevant light degrees of freedom are retained , namely , those related to the so called kaluza - klein states . in principle , if only gravity is of higher dimensional origin , spin-0 , 1 and 2 kk states can arise @xcite .",
    "the spin-1 states decouple from the standard model fields and make no contribution to the self - energies .",
    "naively , one expects the spin-0 contributions to be of the same order of magnitude as that of the spin-2 states since they have the same coupling strength .",
    "however , the properties of the spin-0 states are model - dependent since there is no symmetry to protect their masses . in the following",
    "we shall concentrate on the spin-2 kk states ( which we will call kk gravitons ) .    the physical process that we consider in this paper is the radiative corrections to the weak gauge boson masses at the one - loop level from these kk gravitons .",
    "we focus our attention on the transverse part of the self - energy @xmath21 between gauge bosons @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as it is the only part relevant to us .",
    "these self - energies are written as @xmath24 note that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are identically zero , following from the simple fact that they must be proportional to the photon mass , as required by the gravitational nature of the kk graviton - matter interactions .",
    "there are two diagrams contributing to the self - energy of a gauge boson , as shown in fig .",
    "[ graphs ] . the first ( seagull diagram )",
    "involves a four  point coupling of two kk gravitons and two gauge bosons , and the second ( rainbow diagram ) involves two three  point couplings of a kk graviton and two gauge bosons .",
    "these two diagrams are at the same order in the gravitational coupling @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the usual four - dimensional newton s constant .    to obtain the four - point vertex feynman rule required for the seagull diagram",
    ", one needs to expand the graviton - matter interaction lagrangian to order @xmath29 , which is beyond the order of the expansion given in @xcite .",
    "we provide this feynman rule in appendix a. the corresponding seagull diagram is purely transverse , proportional to @xmath30 , with @xmath31 where we have included a factor @xmath32 to avoid double - counting when we sum over the kk modes and the subscript @xmath33 indicates that the variable is in euclidean space .",
    "the summation over the kk modes in a tower can be written as an integration because of the near - degeneracy of the kk states , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the kk state density . by convention for the torus compactification @xcite , the relation between the four - dimensional newton s constant and the @xmath36-dimensional string scale @xmath5 is given by @xmath37 using eqs .",
    "( [ summation ] ) ,  ( [ density ] ) and  ( [ convention ] ) , we obtain @xmath38 the above sum is divergent in the ultraviolet for @xmath39 unless @xmath40 falls off very rapidly with @xmath41 . since the effective theory is only expected to be valid below the string scale , we introduce an explicit cutoff @xmath42 to regularize the mass sum , where @xmath43 and parameterizes the sensitivity to the cutoff .",
    "we shall use the same cutoff for the momentum integral as for the mass summation .",
    "we believe that this regulator will best reflect the ultraviolet behavior of the divergence .",
    "our final result for the seagull diagram is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the necessary feynman rules for calculating the rainbow diagram have been derived in @xcite and are summarized in appendix a. the complete expression for the general @xmath47 is lengthy and unilluminating .",
    "we will instead present the special cases relevant to our current consideration , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the former can be written as @xmath50\\ , \\label{rainbow0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced a dimensionless mass ratio between the gauge boson mass and the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath51 .",

    "@xcite for a scalar mass correction , and not to @xmath56 as found in @xcite .",
    "consequently , there is no hard quadratic dependence on the cutoff . on the other hand , the proportionality factor",
    "@xmath57 appearing in the above expressions implies that the results are rather sensitive to the precise value of the cutoff in comparison to the string scale @xmath5 .",
    "this is an intrinsic uncertainty for any process involving virtual kk graviton exchanges in an effective theory .",
    "before we end this section , a few remarks related to the potential uncertainties of the results are in order :    1 .",
    "( [ seagull ] ) , ( [ rainbow0 ] ) and ( [ rainbowm ] ) appear to be infrared divergent as a consequence of the pole at @xmath58 for massless gravitons .",
    "this must be an artifact of the fixed - order perturbative calculation since gravity is known to be infrared safe .",
    "we will regularize the infrared singularity using the principles of dimensional regularization and perform the minimal subtraction .",
    "the procedure is described in appendix b. 2 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the limit for a large value of the cutoff @xmath59 , or equivalently @xmath60 . as an illustration we consider @xmath7 .",
    "the seagull diagram is independent of @xmath61 and gives @xmath62 and the rainbow diagram gives @xmath63 therefore , the total self - energy correction @xmath64 takes the following values at @xmath65 and @xmath66 : @xmath67 one would hope that the self - energy corrections vanish as the string scale is set to infinity , as required by the decoupling theorem .",
    "this has been explicitly shown not to be the case by the naive results in eq .",
    "( [ tot ] ) .",
    "the problem lies in the fact that an unknown cosmological constant can also contribute to the gauge boson self - energies via gravitational interactions .",
    "a non - zero cosmological constant term is of the form @xmath68 and would lead to an additional contribution to the self - energy by tadpole diagrams , @xmath69 this term can drastically change the previously calculated self energies . if @xmath70 , eq .  ( [ pil ] ) could be at the same order of eq .",
    "( [ tot ] ) and could thus provide the appropriate counter - term . however , due to the lack of a consistent way of determining the cosmological constant , the precise value of the term in eq . ( [ pil ] ) is not known . as a result , the self - energies and subsequently , corrections to the @xmath71 and @xmath72 boson masses have inherent uncertainties .",
    "3 .   in our calculations for the gauge boson self - energies ,",
    "we have adopted the momentum - cutoff scheme to regularize the divergent mass sum and the momentum integral , since we consider this scheme a most direct reflection of the ultraviolet behavior .",
    "we anticipate that the physics results would not depend upon the specific regularization scheme .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the above potential ambiguities are of no concern to us if we adopt the @xmath1-formalism since the oblique parameters are manifestly finite @xcite .",
    "the regulator independence built into the definition of the oblique parameters make the infrared and ultraviolet divergences as well as the irrelevant constants drop out when taking the difference of the appropriate combination of self - energies , as we will present next .",
    "the studies of electroweak radiative corrections have proven to be powerful in constraining new physics @xcite beyond the sm .",
    "a convenient parameterization of new physics from a higher scale is the @xmath1-formalism @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters can be obtained by evaluating the self - energy corrections at the energy scales @xmath73 and 0 .",
    "we write the oblique parameters as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the sine and cosine of the weak mixing angle and @xmath77 is the fine structure constant , all measured at @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath2 ( @xmath79 ) parameter measures the difference in the contribution of new physics to neutral ( charged ) current processes at different energy scales .",
    "@xmath4 is generally small .",
    "the @xmath3 parameter serves as a comparison between the new contributions to the neutral and charged current processes at low energy , proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "comparing experimental data mainly from the lep and slc to sm predictions with @xmath81 gev leads to the bounds @xcite , @xmath82    we perform an oblique correction analysis using the calculations of the previous section and the sm parameters @xcite @xmath83 we assume the central values of eq .",
    "( [ stu ] ) to be the sm predictions and attribute the error bars to the physics contribution of our current interest .",
    "our numerical results are presented in figs .",
    "( [ s])-([u ] ) where we have set @xmath84 .    in fig .",
    "[ s ] , we have plotted @xmath85 , the excess contribution to the sm value of the @xmath2 parameter arising from the kk graviton exchanges of the one - loop self - energy diagrams , for @xmath7 ( positive ) and @xmath86 ( negative ) .",
    "these values must lie within the error bars stated in eq .",
    "( [ stu ] ) to not be in conflict with precision electroweak measurements .",
    "we see that for @xmath7 , this leads to a lower bound @xmath6 tev and for @xmath87 , @xmath88 gev at the @xmath89 level .",
    "there is no constraint for @xmath90 from the @xmath2 parameter and we have therefore neglected to plot the cases @xmath91 .",
    "figure  [ t ] shows that the @xmath3 parameter imposes constraints on @xmath5 for all @xmath13 .",
    "this seems to be counter - intuitive at first sight since the interactions of kk gravitons with matter should respect the custodial @xmath92 symmetry and thus lead to a null contribution to @xmath3 .",
    "however , the mass difference of the gauge bosons make their couplings to the gravitons different , resulting in a negative graviton contribution to @xmath3 . in fact , the constraints for @xmath93 are more stringent than that obtained from the @xmath2 parameter .",
    "for instance , the lower limit on @xmath5 is raised to 1.25 ( 0.75 ) tev for @xmath87 ( 6 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 parameter is generally small and it is true here as well .",
    "on the other hand , the error bars on @xmath4 are still rather large and we would not expect improvement by it . indeed , from fig .",
    "[ u ] , we see that the @xmath4 parameter places no constraint whatsoever .",
    "we have obtained significant constraints on the string scale @xmath5 , by considering the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters from precision electroweak data .",
    "one may wonder if the @xmath1-formalism is suitable since gravitons can be lighter than gauge bosons .",
    "we consider our treatment appropriate because as a collective contribution , the relevant effects are characterized by the string scale at about a tev .",
    "a more subtle question is whether the non - oblique corrections would also be as important and how they can be incorporated .",
    "in fact , leading kk graviton corrections appear even at tree level and significant effects were found in the literature @xcite .",
    "we thus view our approach to single out the oblique corrections as the next - to - leading contribution as reasonable .    as we see from eq .",
    "( [ tot ] ) , the self - energy corrections remain finite in the limit @xmath94 . as explained in the paragraph following it",
    ", it is possible to achieve `` decoupling behavior '' by introducing a cosmological constant as a counter - term . by no means",
    "is this necessary as far as the oblique parameters are concerned .",
    "the effect of the heavy states does decouple in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 as seen from the relation eq .",
    "( [ tot ] ) , @xmath95 altough demonstrated specifically for the case @xmath7 , we have confirmed this to be true for all @xmath13 .",
    "it is reassuring to obtain the `` decoupling '' relations , which imply that the radiative corrections based on this effective field theory of kk gravitons are under control .",
    "for all of our numerical analysis , the choice @xmath84 corresponds to taking the cutoff scale as the string scale .",
    "this is the same as the choice in most phenomenological studies @xcite .",
    "there is the intrinsic uncertainty due to the ratio parameter @xmath96 , although it is reasonable to assume it to be of order unity .",
    "more definitive results will depend on details of a string model @xcite near the string scale .    in summary",
    ", we obtained significant lower bounds on @xmath5 from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters . for one and two standard deviations",
