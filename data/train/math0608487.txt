    "in the study of finite quandles and the knot invariants they define , decomposable quandles are often neglected in favor of indecomposable or connected quandles since for knots , two decomposable quandles with the same orbit decomposition define the same counting invariant : if @xmath0 then @xmath1 the sum of the counting invariants defined by the orbit subquandles , where @xmath2 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath3 .",
    "this follows from the fact that knot quandles have a single orbit , so the image of any homomorphism @xmath4 from a knot quandle @xmath5 into a finite target quandle @xmath6 must lie inside a single orbit .",
    "the quandle of a multi - component link , however , is not connected , and the counting invariants defined by nonisomorphic decomposable quandles with the same orbit decomposition are generally different for links .    the motivation for this paper was to study the counting invariants defined by decomposable quandles for multi - component virtual links .",
    "we started with the case of finite target quandles whose orbits are trivial subquandles , so that all of the interesting structure is in the off - diagonal portion of the quandle s matrix  trivial subquandles which have been put together in a non - trivial way .",
    "we call such quandles _ trivial orbit quandles _ or",
    "_ toqs_.    our main result says that the linking number of a two - component classical link is determined up to sign by the counting invariants for a family of trivial orbit quandles of a particular form .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ q ] we review the definitions of quandles , the quandle counting invariant and virtual linking numbers . in section [ l ]",
    "we give our main result and some examples .",
    "in this section we review some definitions .",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8    next , we need    we may specify a quandle structure on the finite set @xmath9 by giving an @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 whose entry in row @xmath12 column @xmath13 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 ; that is , @xmath11 is the operation table of @xmath16 where we forget the `` @xmath17 ' 's and just write the subscripts .",
    "quandles and their structure have been studied in many works such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and more .",
    "a quandle @xmath18 is _ decomposable _ if we may write @xmath0 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are both subquandles of @xmath18 .",
    "note that even if a quandle is not decomposable in this sense , we may still be able to write @xmath21 for @xmath22 disjoint subquandles ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a quandle is _ connected _ if there is an element @xmath23 such that every element of @xmath18 is equivalent to a word of the form @xmath24    in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , a quandle is defined for any oriented tame classical link @xmath25 via a wirtinger - type presentation , which is called the _ knot quandle _ of the link @xmath25 .",
    "specifically , looking in the positive direction of the overcrossing strand @xmath26 , if the undercrossing arc on the right is @xmath27 then the one on the left is @xmath28 .",
    "note that we do not use the orientation of the undercrossing strand .",
    "a    @xmath29    the isomorphism type of the knot quandle is invariant under reidemeister moves ; indeed , the quandle axioms are chosen specifically to make this so . if @xmath25 is a knot and @xmath17 is a generator assigned to an arc in @xmath25 , then every generator ( and hence every word ) in the knot quandle is equivalent to a word starting with @xmath17 since we can just proceed around the knot following the specified orientation , picking up quandle operations to build a word , until we reach @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the knot quandle of a single - component link is connected .",
    "while joyce defined the knot quandle only for classical knots and links , in @xcite kauffman observed that the same wirtinger - type definition extends to virtual knots and links by simply ignoring virtual crossings .",
    "the resulting quandle , while not a classifying invariant for virtual knots and links , is nevertheless an invariant of virtual isotopy .    given a finite quandle @xmath6 ,",
    "the number of homomorphisms from a knot quandle @xmath30 into @xmath6 is an easily computable link invariant : since @xmath30 is finitely generated , there is a finite set of possible homomorphisms into @xmath6 , so we can simply check which of these satisfy the relations in @xmath30 and hence are homomorphisms . the following is a standard result :    let @xmath25 be a link with knot quandle @xmath30 and let @xmath6 be a finite quandle .",
    "then the number of homomorphisms @xmath31 is an invariant of quandle isomorphism and hence is an invariant of virtual isotopy of the link .",
    "indeed , joyce @xcite showed that the knot quandle determines both the knot group and a longitude , and hence determines the knot type of a classical knot up to homeomorphism ( not necessarily orientation preserving ) of pairs @xmath32 .",
    "hence , many of the classical link invariants should be derivable from the knot quandle",
    ". a deeper understanding of how link invariants arise from the knot quandle should provide us with a better understanding both of how other link invariants are related and of links themselves . in the next section we will show how linking number is determined up to sign by the quandle counting invariants associated to a particular kind of non - connected quandle .",
    "we begin with a discussion of linking number for virtual knots .        for classical links , the two linking numbers are equal since if @xmath33 crosses over @xmath34 at a positive crossing , it must either cross back over @xmath34 at a negative crossing ( contributing zero to both linking numbers ) or cross under @xmath34 at a positive crossing ( contributing @xmath35 to both linking numbers ) to come back to join itself without any virtual crossings . for virtual links ,",
    "the two linking numbers are completely independent .",
    "indeed , we have      for virtual links , the virtual linking numbers have some advantages over the usual classical linking number . for example , if @xmath36 is split , then both @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; this is a stronger condition than @xmath40 , since contributions from two unequal virtual linking numbers may cancel .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the first two quandle axioms are easy to check since the diagonal entries are @xmath45 in order and each column is a permutation of @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we need only check that the third quandle axiom is satisfied .",
    "we do this in cases .",
    "case 1 : @xmath47 all in the same subquandle . in this case , @xmath48 since the subquandles are quandles themselves .                        for the remainder of this paper ,",
    "let @xmath25 be a two - component virtual link diagram @xmath36 . to find quandle colorings of @xmath25",
    ", we take a choice of color @xmath75 for one arc and attempt to `` push it through '' each crossing , that is , assign to the opposite undercrossing arc the color determined by the quandle coloring condition and the color on the overcrossing arc . since our coloring quandle @xmath42 is a trivial orbit quandle , pushing any color through at a crossing where both strands are from the same component yields the same color on both underarcs since the colors on a component are from the same trivial orbit subquandle .",
    "thus we have :    in a quandle coloring of a link by @xmath42 ( or any trivial orbit quandle ) , the colors on the undercrossing strands at a crossing can differ only if the overcrossing and undercrossing strands belong to distinct components .",
    "[ l0 ] in a quandle coloring of @xmath25 by @xmath42 , an inbound undercrossing arc colored @xmath76 pushes through a crossing with an overarc colored @xmath77 to become @xmath78 at a positive crossing and @xmath79 at a negative crossing .        pushing through any choice of color for a starting arc",
    "extends the same color along that component of the link until overcrossings from the other component of @xmath25 are reached .",
    "for any pair of starting arcs with one arc on each component , if both starting colors are from the same orbit , then both colors push through unchanged and we have a coloring of the link which is constant on each component . if the colors are from different orbits in @xmath42 , then one component has every arc colored @xmath77 , and a given starting coloring @xmath60 pushes through an overcrossing colored with @xmath77 to become @xmath82 or @xmath83 depending on the crossing sign . continuing pushing through each crossing , we eventually reach our original starting arc .",
    "then we have a valid quandle coloring iff the color thus determined on the starting arc agrees with the original color . in both cases",
    "( starting arcs in the same orbit subquandle or in different orbit subquandles ) , the colors on all of the arcs are determined by the colors on the initial two arcs .",
    "there are @xmath81 such choices .",
    "if we color one arc of @xmath84 with @xmath89 , then in any quandle coloring of @xmath25 every arc of @xmath84 must be colored with @xmath77 , since every element of @xmath42 acts trivially on @xmath77 . in order to have a valid quandle coloring",
    ", the original color on the starting arc must match the color determined by pushing @xmath17 through the full length of the component to return to the starting arc .",
    "lemma [ l0 ] implies that this final color is @xmath90 , so an initial color of @xmath91 on an arc of @xmath86 pushes through to a valid coloring iff @xmath92 .",
    "finally , note that the property of pushing through does not depend on the actual value of @xmath91 , only its orbit , so if one such color yields a valid quandle coloring , then all @xmath88 colors in @xmath85 yield valid quandle colorings .",
    "we have @xmath94 if @xmath25 has colorings with @xmath77 on @xmath84 and colors from @xmath85 on @xmath86 for both @xmath95 ; @xmath96 if @xmath25 has colorings with @xmath77 on @xmath84 and colors in @xmath85 on @xmath86 for @xmath97 or @xmath98 but not both ; and @xmath99 if @xmath25 has no multi - orbit colorings .",
    "note that @xmath100 implies that the virtual linking numbers are unequal and @xmath25 is non - classical .",
    "@xmath94 if and only if each starting coloring choice for a given pair of arcs on the two components pushes through to a valid coloring . by lemma [ l1",
    "] , this can only happen if both virtual linking numbers are zero mod @xmath88 , i. e. , if @xmath107 and @xmath108          conversely , suppose @xmath110 for all @xmath114 .",
    "then by corollary [ c1 ] at least one of the two virtual linking numbers is greater than 0 in absolute value .",
    "if both are greater than 1 in absolute value , then let @xmath119 , contrary to hypothesis .",
    "hence either @xmath111 , @xmath112 , or both @xmath115 .",
    "if @xmath121 then neither linking number is 0 or 1 in absolute value by corollaries [ c1 ] and [ c2 ] .",
    "then @xmath124 says that @xmath88 divides one linking number but not the other by lemma [ l1 ] ; @xmath125 is the largest number which divides both @xmath126 and @xmath127 by corollary [ c4 ]",
    ".        if both virtual linking numbers are zero , then corollary [ c1 ] says @xmath130 .",
    "if both are @xmath131 , then by corollary [ c2 ] we have @xmath132 . finally , if @xmath133 ( which equals @xmath127 since @xmath25 is classical ) then the set @xmath134 includes all and only positive integer divisors of @xmath135 , so @xmath136",
    "as a practical observation , we note that corollary [ c3 ] implies that it is not necessary to test an infinite number of quandle counting invariants to determine @xmath138 ; it is sufficient to compute @xmath80 for @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the number of multi - component crossings in @xmath25 .",
    "of course , our interest in theorem [ main ] lies not in finding a new less practical method of computing linking numbers but rather as a connection between quandle - based link invariants and classical link invariants ."
