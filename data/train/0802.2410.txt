    "the simplest model of such dots is the constant interaction ( ci ) model , in which the interaction is taken to be the classical charging energy . charging energy leads to coulomb blockade peaks in the conductance versus gate voltage .",
    "each peak occurs as the gate voltage is tuned to compensate for the coulomb repulsion and an additional electron tunnels into the dot . for a fixed number of electrons ,",

    "these universal interaction terms include , in addition to charging energy , a constant exchange interaction .",
    "the inclusion of an exchange interaction has explained the statistics of peak heights at low and moderate temperatures as well as the suppression of the peak spacing fluctuations  @xcite . however , at low temperatures , the peak spacing distribution remains bimodal even when the exchange interaction is included , while none of the experimental distributions are bimodal  @xcite .    for finite thouless conductance , residual interactions beyond the universal hamiltonian",
