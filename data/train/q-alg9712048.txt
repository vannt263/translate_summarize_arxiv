    "suppose further that @xmath21 is an un - knot with untwisted framing .",
    "then a knot @xmath23 together with @xmath20 yield a satellite knot @xmath24 of @xmath3 by removing a tube around @xmath3 and a tube around @xmath21 and gluing the two knot complements together to retain only @xmath22 , specifically by gluing the longitude of @xmath3 ( given by the framing ) to the meridian of @xmath21 and vice - versa . in other words , @xmath20 yields a satellite operation @xmath25 .",
    "there are two ways in which @xmath24 might be a composite knot .",
    "firstly , any summand of @xmath20 ( necessarily a summand of @xmath22 ) appears as a summand of @xmath24 . secondly ,",
    "if @xmath3 is trivial , then @xmath24 can be substantially simpler than and different from @xmath20 and can be a composite knot , even if @xmath20 is prime .    if @xmath20 is prime and @xmath3 is non - trivial , then @xmath24 is prime , even if @xmath3 is composite .",
    "[ lprime ]    this is a classical result that is proved by an innermost circle argument : assume a sphere @xmath26 that separates @xmath24 into summands and put it in a position of minimal transverse intersection with the boundary torus of @xmath3 .",
    "an analysis of the innermost circles of intersection on @xmath26 yields a summand of @xmath20 or a new sphere with smaller intersection .    now suppose that @xmath20 is hyperbolic and does not admit a symmetry that inverts @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a non - invertible knot and let @xmath27 be its inverse .",
    "then @xmath24 and @xmath28 are prime , and they differ as unoriented knots as follows : since @xmath20 is hyperbolic , its complement is an aspherical , atoroidal , and acylindrical 3-manifold ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath20 is prime , connected , not the hopf link , and not a non - trivial satellite ) .",
    "let @xmath29 be the torus jacketing @xmath24 ( _ i.e. _ , the gluing torus in the construction of the satellite ) , and let @xmath30 be a diffeomorphism of @xmath19 that takes @xmath24 to @xmath28 such that @xmath29 and @xmath31 are in a position of minimal transverse intersection .",
    "if the intersection is non - empty , then by another standard analysis of innermost circles , the result is either an essential sphere , cylinder , or torus , or a smaller intersection @xcite .",
    "if the intersection is empty , then @xmath29 and @xmath31 must be parallel , for otherwise @xmath20 would have an essential torus .",
    "but in this case , @xmath30 must invert either the @xmath3 piece or the @xmath20 piece , a contradiction .    for an explicit example",
    ", we can take @xmath3 to be the knot @xmath32 , as shown in figure  [ f817 ] , and @xmath20 to be the link @xmath33 , as shown in figure  [ f9234 ] , using conway s enumeration @xcite . according to snappea @xcite and mostow rigidity , neither @xmath3 nor @xmath20 admit the undesired symmetries .",
    "indeed , @xmath20 has no symmetries , and we can take either component to be @xmath21 .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is a set and @xmath34 is an invariant which intertwines all satellite operations .",
    "we say that @xmath35 _ distinguishes _ @xmath10 and @xmath11 as unoriented knots if the sets @xmath36 and @xmath37 differ",
    ". let @xmath3 and @xmath20 be as above , let @xmath38 be @xmath20 with @xmath22 inverted , and suppose that @xmath35 distinguishes @xmath24 and @xmath28 as unoriented knots .",
    "then it is immediate that either @xmath39 or @xmath40 distinguishes @xmath3 from @xmath27 . since @xmath35 intertwines these , @xmath35 must also distinguish @xmath3 from @xmath27 .",
    "this establishes theorem  [ thsat ] .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath14 , the universal vassiliev invariant of order @xmath15 , and @xmath41 , the universal quantum invariant for a knot @xmath3 and a lie algebra @xmath16 , both intertwine all satellite operations .",
    "as before , let @xmath42 be the set of framed , oriented knots in @xmath19 , and let @xmath43 be the set of framed , oriented , immersed circles in @xmath19 with @xmath15 double points with transverse tangents .",
    "( the immersed circles will loosely be called generalized knots . ) for example , @xmath18 and @xmath44 are the codimension 0 and codimension 1 cells of a stratification of the space of smooth maps from @xmath45 to @xmath19 .",

    "given a generalized knot @xmath64 with linearly ordered double points ( not necessarily ordered as they appear along @xmath3 ) , there is a map @xmath65 which acts on an element of the product basis by replacing each double point of @xmath3 by the corresponding factor crossing .",
    "for example , if @xmath3 is the generalized knot shown in figure  [ fgenknot ] , then @xmath66 is the knot shown in figure  [ fphi ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath67 is simply @xmath3 itself as an element of @xmath6 .",

    "finally , let @xmath69 .",

    "we can take the satellite of @xmath3 , of sorts , corresponding to @xmath20 by replacing every double point by @xmath70 double points , replacing every crossing by @xmath70 crossings , every arc but one by @xmath71 arcs , and the remaining arc by the pattern of @xmath22 , as shown in figure  [ fl2 ] .",
    "the result @xmath72 is not unique ; it depends on where we place the pattern of @xmath22 , and if @xmath20 is rearranged , even @xmath15 can change .",
    "nevertheless , the vector @xmath73 in @xmath6 is uniquely determined by @xmath3 and @xmath20 up to sign , because it equals @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is interpreted as an endomorphism of @xmath6 and @xmath3 is interpreted as an element of @xmath6 . here",
    "we order the double points of @xmath72 in bunches according to which double points of @xmath3 they come from .",
    "( the sign is due to the fact that the satellite operations may replace a left - handed crossing by a combination of right- and left - handed crossings . ) in other words , @xmath3 represents a certain linear combination of honest knots in @xmath6 , and @xmath76 is the same linear combination of the @xmath20-satellites of these knots .",
    "observe that @xmath77 .",
    "it follows that @xmath78 since @xmath79 , we can conclude that @xmath80 for every @xmath81 . which is equivalent to the desired result that @xmath53 , which proves theorem  [ thvass ] .",
    "in this section , we argue theorem  [ thquantum ] . let @xmath16 be a simple lie group . following the well - known theory of quantum topological invariants @xcite",
    ", @xmath82 is a quasitriangular hopf algebra , and there corresponds a polynomial invariant of oriented , framed graphs in @xmath19 whose edges are labelled by finite - dimensional representations of @xmath82 and whose vertices are labelled by invariant tensors over the representations of the incident edges . in this theory ,",
    "parallel edges labelled by representations @xmath83 are equivalent to one edge labelled by @xmath84 , and reversing the orientation of an edge is equivalent to taking the dual of its representation .",
    "the invariants are also multiadditive under direct sums .",
    "the standard theory can be generalized in a simple way for links so that each link component is labelled by a formal trace @xmath85 on @xmath82 such that @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath85 is the character of a linear representation , then the generalized invariant is the same as before .",
    "the theory is then multilinear over formal traces , which form a vector space @xmath87 . in particular ,",
    "given a knot @xmath3 , there is a universal invariant @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , the characters of irreducible representations form a basis for @xmath87 since @xmath89 is semisimple for @xmath90 an indeterminate , so the generalization is in this case nothing more than the linear completion of the invariants in which edges are labelled by true representations .    given a 2-component link @xmath20 as in the previous section ,",
    "if we interpret the second component @xmath22 as a knot in a solid torus and label it by a representation @xmath6 , then in the quantum topological invariant theory it represents some equivariant endomorphism of @xmath91 , where each @xmath92 is either @xmath6 or @xmath93 ( see figure  [ fendo ] ) .",
    "the tensor product @xmath94 has a direct sum decomposition @xmath95 where @xmath96 a set with one representative of each irreducible representation and @xmath97 is a non - negative integer .",
    "the map @xmath22 , as an endomorphism of @xmath6 , decomposes as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an @xmath100 matrix over the ground field and @xmath101 is the identity on @xmath102 . if @xmath103 is the quantum invariant of @xmath3 colored by the representation @xmath6 , then @xmath104 the left side is a satellited quantum group invariant of the knot @xmath3 .",
    "the right side is a linear combination of ordinary quantum group invariants with different representations .",
    "equation  [ eqsat ] establishes that @xmath105 factors through @xmath41 .",
    "therefore @xmath75 intertwines @xmath106 .",
    "that quantum group invariants are invariant under inversion is equivalent to the statement that @xmath107 for every @xmath102 .",
    "recall that the quantum group @xmath82 is constructed from the dynkin diagram of @xmath16 , and that any such dynkin diagram has a dualizing automorphism , _",
    "i.e. _ , an automorphism which takes the highest weight of an irreducible representation @xmath102 to the highest weight of the dual representation @xmath108 .",
    "it follows that the pair @xmath109 is isomorphic to the pair @xmath110 , and that the invariants are equal .",
    "the treatment of quantum group invariants generalizes from @xmath82 to arbitrary quasitriangular hopf algebras @xmath111 .",
    "however , in the general case , there is no guarantee that a dualizing homomorphism exists . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath112)$ ] is the quantum double of a finite group algebra , the corresponding invariant @xmath113 counts group homomorphisms from @xmath114 to @xmath115 with a specified restriction to the peripheral subgroup . strictly speaking ,",
    "one fixes a group element @xmath116 and a linear representation @xmath6 of the centralizer of @xmath116 , and one takes the sum of @xmath117 over homomorphisms that take @xmath71 to @xmath116 , where @xmath71 is the meridian and @xmath55 is the longitude .",
    "however , after a transformation , this is the same as counting homomorphisms that take @xmath118 to @xmath119 for fixed @xmath116 and @xmath30 .",
    "although it is interesting to consider this invariant in quantum terms @xcite , a more sober point of view in practice is that of classical group theory and algebraic topology .",
    "define a group - theoretic knot to be a triple @xmath120 , where @xmath115 is a group and @xmath71 and @xmath55 are two arbitrary commuting elements of @xmath115 called the meridian and the longitude .",
    "an honest knot @xmath3 in @xmath19 yields a group - theoretic knot @xmath121 which determines @xmath3 completely .",
    "define @xmath120 to be _",
    "invertible _ if there exists an automorphism of @xmath115 that inverts @xmath71 and @xmath55 .",
    "this too is equivalent to invertibility for honest knots .",
    "if the number of homomorphisms from @xmath122 to @xmath123 differs from the number of homomorphisms to @xmath124 , then @xmath3 is clearly non - invertible .",
    "moreover , by inclusion - exclusion over subgroups of @xmath115 , counting homomorphisms yields the same information as counting epimorphisms .",
    "let @xmath125 be the @xmath15th commutator subgroup of @xmath126 .",
    "the first interesting group - theoretic model of @xmath3 is @xmath127 , whose structure is characterized by the alexander polynomial @xmath128 .",
    "unfortunately , the well - known identity @xmath129 implies that @xmath127 is an invertible group - theoretic knot . in other words ,",
    "all 3-dimensional knots are invertible at the metabelian level ; if @xmath115 is metabelian , counting homomorphisms to @xmath115 can not detect invertibility .",
    "the quotient @xmath130 is more fruitful : hartley @xcite found that the homology of metabelian coverings often does detect invertibility , which amounts to counting homomorphisms to certain meta - metabelian groups ( groups with metabelian commutator ) .",
    "however , neither these groups nor any other solvable groups will yield any information when the alexander polynomial of @xmath3 is trivial . in this case",
    ", @xmath131 is a perfect group , which means that @xmath132 for all @xmath15 , which is the same as the unknot , which is invertible .",
    "the first example of such a knot is conway s 11-crossing knot , shown in figure  [ fconway ] .",
    "the sporadic simple group @xmath0 of order 7920 admits no automorphism that inverts an element @xmath116 of order 11 .",
    "we report here that , if @xmath3 is the conway knot , then @xmath133 admits precisely one epimorphism to @xmath0 that sends the meridian @xmath71 to either @xmath116 or @xmath134 .",
    "it follows that @xmath3 is non - invertible .",
    "this result was obtained by a computer search : working with the wirtinger presentation of the knot group , the algorithm finds among all maps from the generating set to the conjugacy class of @xmath116 those which satisfy the relations .",
    "note that wirtinger generators are conjugate because they all meridians , so we need not consider other maps from the generators to @xmath0 .",
    "the first generator can be mapped to @xmath116 itself , and if the generators are properly ordered , the first three determine the others in the case of the conway knot .",
    "those who wish to investigate the validity of this computational result can find the author s software on the internet @xcite .",
    "snappea can also prove that @xmath3 is non - invertible using the hyperbolic structure of @xmath135 and mostow rigidity , but the proof using @xmath0 is perhaps more elementary , although it does involve computer calculations .",
    "kenichi kawagoe @xcite has verified the author s computational results , and has also verified by computer that the finite groups @xmath136 and @xmath137 can be used to determine the non - invertibility of both the conway knot and the kinoshita - terasaka knot , which is a mutant of the conway knot .",
    "these results support the hypothesis that a knot group , like a free group , has a good chance of admitting any particular finite group @xmath115 as a quotient , provided that @xmath115 is generated by sufficiently few elements .",
    "while such a quotient may prove useful as an invariant , it does not necessarily reveal any special connection between the knot and the group @xmath115 ."
