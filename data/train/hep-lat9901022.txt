    "quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental theory of the strong interaction @xcite and is an su(@xmath8 ) nonabelian gauge theory described by the quark field @xmath9 and the gluon field @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the su(@xmath13 ) field strength @xmath14 $ ] with the covariant - derivative operator @xmath15 . due to the asymptotic freedom , which is one of the most important features in qcd",
    "the gauge - coupling constant of qcd becomes small in the ultraviolet region @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the perturbative qcd can describe the high - energy phenomena like the bjorken scaling and the hadron jet properties @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the low - energy region , the qcd - coupling constant becomes large , and there arise the nonperturbative - qcd ( np - qcd ) phenomena such as color confinement and dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking corresponding to the strong - coupling nature .",
    "these np - qcd phenomena are extremely difficult to understand in the analytical manner from qcd , and have been studied by using the effective models @xcite or the lattice qcd simulation @xcite . here , the lattice qcd monte carlo simulation is the numerical calculation of the qcd partition functional , and it is one of the most reliable methods directly based on qcd .",
    "in fact , the lattice qcd simulations well reproduce nonperturbative quantities such as the quark static potential , the chiral condensate @xmath16 and low - lying hadron masses @xcite .",
    "recently , the lattice qcd simulation has shed light on the confinement mechanism in terms of the dual - superconductor picture , which was proposed by nambu,t hooft and mandelstam in the middle of 1970 s @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "quark confinement can be understood with the dual version of the superconductivity . in the ordinary superconductor",
    ", the meissner effect occurs by condensation of the cooper - pair with the electric charge .",
    "consider the existence of the magnetic charges with the opposite sign immersed in the superconductor , then the magnetic flux is squeezed like a tube between the magnetic charges , and the magnetic potential between them becomes linear as the result of the meissner effect @xcite . in the dual - superconductor scenario ,",
    "the qcd vacuum is assumed as the dual version of the superconductor , and the dual meissner effect brings the one - dimensional flux squeezing @xcite between the quark and the anti - quark , which leads to the linear confinement potential @xcite .",
    "the dual higgs mechanism , however , requires `` color - magnetic monopole condensation '' as the dual version of electric condensation in the superconductor , although qcd dose not include the color - magnetic monopole as the elementary degrees of freedom . on the appearance of magnetic monopoles from qcd",
    ", t hooft showed that qcd is reduced to an abelian gauge theory with magnetic monopoles by taking the abelian gauge , which fixes the partial gauge symmetry su(@xmath8)/u@xmath17 through the diagonalization of a gauge - dependent variable @xcite .",
    "here , the monopole appears as the topological object corresponding to the nontrivial homotopy group @xmath18(su(@xmath19)/u@xmath20)=@xmath21 .",
    "as for the irrelevance of off - diagonal gluons , recent lattice qcd studies show the abelian dominance @xcite for the np - qcd phenomena in the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge @xcite .",
    "for instance , confinement @xcite and dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking @xcite are almost described only by the diagonal gluon component , in the ma gauge .",
    "then , taking the ma gauge and removing off - diagonal gluons , the abelian - projected qcd ( ap - qcd ) is obtained as the abelian gauge theory keeping the np - qcd features .",
    "ap - qcd includes not only the electric current @xmath0 but also the magnetic current @xmath1 , and can be decomposed into the monopole part and the photon part corresponding to the separation of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd studies show that only the monopole part is responsible to np - qcd phenomena @xcite especially to the electric confinement @xcite in the ma gauge .",
    "this is called as the monopole dominance .    in this paper , we concentrate the monopole part ( the monopole - current system ) in the ma gauge in qcd , and study the dual higgs mechanism in the qcd vacuum based on the dual gauge formalism @xcite . to this end",
    ", we perform the su(2 ) lattice qcd simulation in the ma gauge , and extract the monopole current @xmath1 as the relevant degrees of freedom for electric confinement .",
    "then , we calculate inter - monopole potential in the monopole part , ( the monopole current system ) in qcd to examine monopole condensation , and evaluate the effective mass of the dual gluon field @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "recent studies with the lattice qcd monte carlo simulation have revealed the abelian dominance and the monopole dominance in the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge for the nonperturbative qcd ( np - qcd ) phenomena such as confinement , dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking and instantons [ 18 - 26 ] . in the continuum",
    "euclidean qcd with @xmath22 , the ma gauge fixing is defined by the minimizing the total amount of off - diagonal gluons , @xmath23= 2\\int d^{4}x [ a_{+}^{\\mu}(x)a_{-}^{\\mu}(x ) ] \\label{eq : ma - gaugesu2}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 by the su(2)-gauge transformation . in the ma gauge ,",
    "off - diagonal gluon components , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , become as small as possible , and the gluon field @xmath27 mostly approaches to the abelian gluon field , @xmath28 . in the ma gauge , the su(2 )",
    "local symmetry is reduced into the u@xmath29 local symmetry with the global weyl symmetry . under the residual @xmath30-gauge transformation with @xmath31 u@xmath29 ,",
    "the gluon components are transformed as @xmath32 then , in the ma gauge , the diagonal gluon @xmath33 behaves as the abelian gauge field , while off - diagonal gluons @xmath34 behave as charged matter fields in terms of the residual gauge symmetry .    as a remarkable feature of the ma gauge",
    ", the abelian dominance holds for the np - qcd phenomena such as quark confinement and chiral - symmetry breaking [ 18 - 21 ] .",
    "here , we call abelian dominance for an operator @xmath35 , when the expectation value @xmath36 \\rangle$ ] is almost equal to the expectation value @xmath37 \\rangle_{\\rm ma}$ ] , where off - diagonal gluons are dropped off in the ma gauge . for instance , the abelian string tension @xmath38 in the ma gauge is almost equal to @xmath39 as @xmath40 for @xmath41 in the lattice qcd [ 24,25 ] .",
    "thus , np - qcd phenomena are almost reproduced only by the abelian gluon @xmath42 , and off - diagonal gluon components @xmath43 do not contribute to np - qcd in the ma gauge .",
    "hence , as long as the infrared physics is concerned , qcd in the ma gauge can be approximated by the abelian projected qcd ( ap - qcd ) , where the su(2 ) gluon field @xmath10 is replaced by the abelian gluon field @xmath44 .",
    "in other word , ap - qcd is the abelian gauge theory keeping essence of np - qcd , and is extracted from qcd in the ma gauge .",
    "hereafter , we pay attention to the ap - qcd described by @xmath44 in the ma gauge .",
    "the abelian - projected qcd ( ap - qcd ) includes not only @xmath0 but also @xmath1 . in this subsection , we investigate the general argument on the extended electro - magnetic system including both the electric current @xmath0 and the magnetic current @xmath1 . in the extended maxwell equations with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the field strength @xmath45 satisfies as @xmath46 with @xmath47 . in the presence of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the field strength @xmath48 can not be described by the simple two - form @xmath49 with the regular one - form @xmath44 [ 29 ] . in general , the field strength @xmath48 consists of two parts , @xmath50 where the former part denotes the ordinary two - form and the latter part @xmath51 denotes the dirac - string singularity [ 29 ] . here",
    ", @xmath52 can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . here",
    ", @xmath56 is arbitrary four - dimensional unit vector corresponding to the direction of the dirac string .",
    "thus , in the ordinary description [ 29 ] the system includes the singularity as the dirac string @xmath52 , which makes the analysis complicated .      to clarify the roles of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the nonperturbative quantities of qcd",
    ", we consider the decomposition of ap - qcd into the photon part and the monopole part , corresponding to the separation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we call this separation into the photon and monopole parts as the `` photon projection '' and the `` monopole projection '' , respectively .",
    "[ 26,30 ] .",
    "the field strength @xmath48 in ap - qcd is separated into @xmath57 in the photon part and @xmath58 in the monopole part @xmath59 as the physical requirement , @xmath57 and @xmath58 satisfies the maxwell equations as @xmath60 respectively . from the requirement @xmath61",
    ", there exists the regular vector @xmath62 is defined so as to satisfying @xmath63 in the photon part .",
    "this relation is the same as @xmath64 in the ordinary qed .    as for the monopole part",
    ", @xmath58 can not be expressed by the simple two - form , but is expressed as @xmath65 where the second term provides the breaking of the bianchi identity . from eqs.([eq : twoform ] ) , ( [ eq : f = f+f ] ) , ( [ eq : def - ph ] ) and ( [ eq : def - mo ] ) , one finds the relation satisfy @xmath66 and then the difference between @xmath67 and @xmath68+@xmath69 is at most the total differential term as @xmath70 .",
    "hence , we can set @xmath71 by taking a suitable gauge without loss of generality .    in the practical calculation ,",
    "the photon part variable @xmath68 and the monopole part variable @xmath69 can be obtained as @xmath72 where the inverse dalembertian @xmath73 is the nonlocal operator [ 31 ] , @xmath74 which satisfies @xmath75 .",
    "let us check that @xmath62 and @xmath76 defined in eqs.([eq : ph ] ) and ( [ eq : mo ] ) , satisfies the physical requirement in eqs.([eq : def - ph ] ) and ( [ eq : def - mo ] ) first , we consider the photon part with @xmath62 . starting from eq.([eq : ph ] )",
    ", one easily finds @xmath77 , and hence the first maxwell equation in eq.([eq : m - eq - ph ] ) in the photon part can be derived as @xmath78 the second maxwell equation in eq.([eq : m - eq - ph ] ) is automatically derived as the bianchi identity for the two form of @xmath68 .",
    "the photon part with @xmath68 defined by eq.([eq : ph ] ) does not include the magnetic current but only includes the electric current .",
    "second , we consider the monopole part with @xmath76 . from eqs.([eq : twoform ] ) , ( [ eq : ph ] ) and ( [ eq : mo ] ) , the sum of @xmath62 and @xmath76 can be written as @xmath79 and hence the two - form of @xmath76 satisfies the physical requirement @xmath80 as @xmath81 therefore , in the monopole part , the maxwell equations is derived as @xmath82 starting from eq.([eq : mo ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath62 and @xmath76 defined as eqs.([eq : ph ] ) , and ( [ eq : mo ] ) satisfy the physical requirement eqs.([eq : def - ph ] ) and ( [ eq : def - mo ] ) .",
    "hence , the monopole part carries the same amount of the magnetic current as that is the original abelian sector , whereas it dose not carries the electric current .",
    "the situation is just the opposite in the photon part . in the actual lattice qcd simulation ,",
    "the monopole current @xmath1 and the electric current @xmath0 are slightly modified through the monopole and the photon projections , respectively , due to the numerical error on the lattice . however , these differences are negligibly small in the actual lattice qcd simulation .",
    "in fact , @xmath83 and @xmath84 hold in the monopole part , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 hold in the photon part within 1@xmath87 error . here , we have kept the labels as `` @xmath88 '' and `` @xmath89 '' for the electric current and the monopole current , and we have used @xmath90 and @xmath91 for these currents in the monopole part and the photon part , respectively .    as a remarkable fact ,",
    "lattice qcd simulations show that nonperturbative quantities such as the string tension , the chiral condensate and instantons are almost reproduced only by the monopole part in the ma gauge , which is called as monopole dominance [ 23 - 26 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the photon part dose not contribute these nonperturbative quantities in qcd .",
    "since we are interested in the np - qcd phenomena , it is convenient and transparent to extract the relevant degrees of freedom for np - qcd by removing irrelevant degrees of freedom like the off - diagonal gluons @xmath43 and the electric current @xmath0",
    ". therefore , we concentrate ourselves to the monopole part , which keeps the essence of np - qcd as confinement .",
    "in this section , we study the monopole part of the qcd vacuum using the dual gauge formalism [ 27,28 ] . in the ma gauge ,",
    "the monopole part carries essence of the nonperturbative qcd as the electric confinement . according to the absence of the electric current @xmath92 ,",
    "the maxwell equation in the monopole part becomes @xmath93 where @xmath58 denotes the field strength in the monopole part .",
    "this system resembles the dual version of qed with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and hence it is useful to introduce the dual gluon field @xmath96 in the monopole part for the study of the dual higgs mechanism in qcd [ 27,28 ] .",
    "the dual gluon field @xmath96 is defined so as to satisfy the relation @xmath97 which is the dual version of the ordinary relation @xmath98 in qed .",
    "the interchange between @xmath10 and @xmath2 corresponds to the electro - magnetic duality transformation , @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",

    "therefore , the dual gluon field @xmath2 is obtained by using the inverse dalembertian @xmath73 as @xmath106 or equivalently @xmath107 thus , the monopole part is described by the monopole current @xmath1 and the dual gluon @xmath2 in the regular manner based on the dual gauge formalism .    in the dual superconductor picture in qcd , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "correspond to the cooper - pair and the photon in the superconductor , respectively . the cooper - pair and",
    "the photon are essential degrees of freedom which bring the superconductivity . in the superconductor",
    ", the photon field @xmath10 gets the effective mass as the result of cooper - pair condensation , and this leads to the meissner effect .",
    "accordingly , the potential between the static electric charges becomes the yukawa potential @xmath108 in the ideal superconductor obeying the london equation .",
    "similarly , the dual gluon @xmath2 is expected to be massive in the the monopole - condensed system , and the mass acquirement of @xmath2 leads to the dual meissner effect . in other words , the acquirement of dual gluon mass @xmath109 reflects monopole condensation , and brings electric confinement .",
    "hence , we can investigate the dual higgs mechanism in qcd by evaluating the dual gluon mass @xmath109 , which is estimated from the inter - monopole potential .    to estimate the interaction between the monopoles , we propose the dual wilson loop @xmath110 [ 27,28 ] .",
