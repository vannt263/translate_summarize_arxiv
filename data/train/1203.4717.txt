    "in this paper we are interested by the mixed finite element approximation of the coupled darcy - stokes problem . the darcy - stokes coupled system provides a linear model for the simulation of incompressible flows in heterogeneous media .",
    "it is governed by the stokes equations in one part of the domain , while in the other part , the flow is described by a standard second order elliptic equation derived from darcy s law and conservation of mass .",
    "proper transmission conditions must also be prescribed on the boundary common to the two media : conservation of mass enforces continuity of the normal velocities at this interface and conservation of momentum enforces the balance of the normal stresses . a further interface condition , supported by empirical evidence and known as the beavers - joseph - saffman condition , must also be taken into account , cf .",
    "the development of suitable numerical methods for the darcy - stokes flow interaction has become a subject of increasing interest during the last decade .",
    "discacciati et al .",
    "@xcite provided the first theoretical study of the problem . the galerkin scheme discussed in @xcite",
    "is based on a standard finite element method for second order elliptic problems in the darcy domain .",
    "motivated by the need of obtaining direct finite element approximations of the darcy flux , most of the approaches ( cf . for instance @xcite ) consider now an @xmath0-flux conforming formulation in the darcy domain .",
    "hence , in this case , a mixed variational formulation in the porous media is coupled with the usual velocity - pressure formulation in the stokes domain .",
    "we also point out that other finite element discretization strategies have been considered for this problem .",
    "for instance , a discontinuous galerkin method is described in @xcite and a stabilized finite element method is presented in @xcite .    in the mixed approach , the transmission condition that guaranties",
    "the equilibrium of the normal velocities becomes essential .",
    "one approach to deal with this constraint consists in enforcing it weakly by means of a lagrange multiplier representing the trace of the darcy pressure on the common interface , see for example @xcite .",
    "one known feature of the finite element discretization of this formulation is that two meshes are required on the transmission boundary satisfying a stability condition between their corresponding mesh sizes , which certainly constitutes a quite cumbersome restriction .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the strong coupling that considers the inclusion of the essential transmission condition directly in the definition of the space to which the darcy flux and the fluid velocity belong ( see below ) .",
    "this formulation prevents from introducing a further unknown ( the lagrange multiplier ) simplifying by the way the saddle point structure of the problem .",
    "two finite element discretizations have already been proposed for this formulation of the problem . in the first one @xcite",
    "the authors provide a unified approximation in the whole domain giving rise to a global @xmath0-conforming scheme that is nonconforming in the fluid domain . in the second one @xcite , a mortar discretization that combines the bernardi - raugel element and the lowest order raviart - thomas element is studied .",
    "our concern in this paper is to figure out how to combine any of the common mixed finite element methods for darcy and stokes problems to end up with a stable scheme for the coupled problem .",
    "we consider stable conforming galerkin schemes in each subdomain and establish the rules under which these schemes can be matched to form a global convergent method .",
    "we will see that the only requirement for the viability of such a coupling is the existence of a discrete stable lifting of the normal trace in @xmath0 .",
    "we can prove that such a lifting is available in the bi - dimensional case for the raviart - thomas and the brezzi - douglas - marini elements while , in the three - dimensional case , to obtain the same result , we need to assume that the triangulation is quasi - uniform in a neighborhood of the transmission boundary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we decribe the governing equations , derive a mixed variational formulation of the problem and show that it is well - posed .",
    "our galerkin scheme is introduced in section [ sec:3 ] by means of abstract finite elements spaces in each subdomain .",
    "we also establish in this section the conditions guarantying the stability of our approximation method . in section [ sec:4 ] , we discuss the approximation properties of the discrete space for the global velocity field and provide our main convergence result .",
    "the key hypotheses providing the convergence of our numerical scheme are discussed in sections [ sec:5 ] and [ sec:6 ] .",
    "we show that they are satisfied for the most common mixed finite elements for darcy and stokes problems under mild conditions on the family of finite element triangulations .",
    "in section [ sec:7 ] we provide some examples obtained by combining well - known finite elements for the stokes problem , such as the mini element and the bernardi - raugel element , with the raviart - thomas and the brezzi - douglas - marini elements in order to obtain a global scheme for the coupled darcy - stokes problem .",

    "<S> the aim of this paper is to propose a systematic way to obtain convergent finite element schemes for the darcy - stokes flow problem by combining well - known mixed finite elements that are separately convergent for darcy and stokes problems . in the approach in which the darcy problem is set in its natural @xmath0 formulation and the stokes problem is expressed in velocity - pressure form , the transmission condition ensuring global mass conservation becomes essential . </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to the strategy that handles weakly this transmission condition through a lagrange multiplier , we impose here this restriction exactly in the space of global velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the galerkin discretization of the resulting problem reveals that , if the mixed finite element space used in the darcy domain admits an @xmath0-stable discrete lifting of the normal trace , then it can be combined with any stable stokes mixed finite element of the same order to deliver a stable global method with quasi - optimal convergence rate . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present a series of numerical tests confirming our theoretical convergence estimates . </S>"
