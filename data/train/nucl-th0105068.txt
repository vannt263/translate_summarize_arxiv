    "an outstanding but still thrilling problem of modern particle physics is to unravel systematically the properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in its low - energy phase where the effective degrees of freedom are hadrons rather than quarks and gluons .",
    "there are two promising paths along which achieved one expects significant further progress .",
    "a direct evaluation of many observable quantities is feasible by large scale numerical simulations where qcd is put on a finite lattice .",
    "though many static properties , like hadron ground - state properties , have been successfully reproduced by lattice calculations , the description of the wealth of hadronic scattering data is still outside the scope of that approach @xcite .",
    "that is a challenge since many of the most exciting phenomena of qcd , like the zoo of meson and baryon resonances , are reflected directly in the scattering data . here",
    "a complementary approach , effective field theory , is more promising . rather than solving low - energy qcd directly in terms of quark and gluonic degrees of freedom , inefficient at low energies ,",
    "one aims at constructing an effective field theory in terms of hadrons directly .",
    "the idea is to constrain that theory by as many properties of qcd as possible .",
    "that leads to a significant parameter reduction and a predictive power of the effective field theory approach . in this spirit many effective field theory models ,",
    "not all of which fully systematic , have been constructed and applied to the data set .",
    "given the many empirical data points to be described , it is not always necessary to build in all constraints of qcd .",
    "part of qcd s properties may enter the model indirectly once it successfully describes the data .",
    "the most difficult part in constructing an acceptable effective field theory is the identification of its applicability domain and its accuracy level .",
    "an effective field theory , which meets above criterium , is the so called chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath10pt ) applicable in the flavor @xmath11 sector of low - energy qcd .",
    "the merit of standard @xmath10pt is that first it is based on an effective lagrangian density constructed in accordance with all chiral constraints of qcd and second that it permits a systematic evaluation applying formal power counting rules @xcite .",
    "there is mounting empirical evidence that the qcd ground state breaks the chiral @xmath11 symmetry spontaneously in the limiting case where the up and down current quark masses of the qcd lagrangian vanish .",
    "for instance the observation that hadrons do not occur in parity doublet states directly reflects that phenomenon .",
    "also the smallness of the pion masses with @xmath12 140 mev much smaller than the nucleon mass @xmath13 940 mev , naturally fits into this picture once the pions are identified to be the goldstone bosons of that spontaneously broken chiral symmetry . in @xmath10pt",
    "the finite but small values of the up and down quark masses @xmath14 10 mev are taken into account as a small perturbation defining the finite masses of the goldstone bosons .",
    "the smallness of the current quark masses on the typical chiral scale of @xmath15 gev explains the success of standard @xmath10pt . for early applications of @xmath10pt to pion - nucleon scattering",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is of course tempting to generalize the successful chiral @xmath11 scheme to the @xmath0 flavor group . to construct the appropriate chiral @xmath0 lagrangian",
    "is mathematically straightforward and has been done long ago ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mass @xmath16 of the strange quark , though much larger than the up and down quark masses , is still small as compared to the typical chiral scale of 1 gev @xcite .",
    "the required approximate goldstone boson octet is readily found with the pions , kaons and the eta - meson",
    ". nevertheless , important predictions of standard @xmath17pt as applied to the @xmath0 flavor group are in stunning conflict with empirical observations .",
    "most spectacular is the failure of the weinberg - tomozawa theorem @xcite which predicts an attractive @xmath18-proton scattering length , rather than the observed large and repulsive scattering length .",
    "progress was made upon accepting the crucial observation that the power counting rules must not be applied to a certain subset of feynman diagrams  @xcite .",
    "whereas for irreducible diagrams the chiral power counting rules are well justified , this is no longer necessarily the case for the irreducible diagrams @xcite .",
    "the latter diagrams are enhanced as compared to irreducible diagrams and therefore may require a systematic resummation scheme in particular in the strangeness sectors .",
    "first intriguing works taking up this idea in the chiral context are given in @xcite .",
    "in this contribution we report on our recent application of the relativistic chiral @xmath0 lagrangian @xcite to meson - baryon scattering .",
    "preliminary results of that work were presented by one of the authors ( m.f.m.l . ) at this meeting . as to our knowledge",
    "this is the first application of the chiral @xmath0 lagrangian density to the kaon - nucleon and antikaon - nucleon system including systematically constraints from the pion - nucleon sector . in our scheme , which considers constraints from chiral and large @xmath4 sum rules , the baryon decuplet field with with @xmath19 is an important ingredient , because it is part of the baryon ground state multiplet which arises in the large @xmath4 limit of qcd @xcite .",
    "we solve the bethe - salpeter equation for the scattering amplitude with the interaction kernel truncated at chiral order @xmath3 where we include only those terms which are leading in the large @xmath4 limit of qcd @xcite .",
    "the renormalization scheme is an essential input of our chiral @xmath0 dynamics , because it leads to consistency with chiral counting rules and an approximate crossing symmetry of the subthreshold scattering amplitudes .",
    "the existing low - energy cross section data on kaon - nucleon and antikaon - nucleon scattering including angular distributions are reproduced to good accuracy . at the same time",
    "we achieve a good description of the low - energy s- and p - wave pion - nucleon phase shifts as well as the empirical axial - vector coupling constants of the baryon octet states .",
    "details on the systematic construction principle for the chiral lagrangian can be found , e.g. , in @xcite . here",

    "one aims at describing hadronic interactions at low energy by constructing an expansion in small momenta and the small pseudo - scalar meson masses .",
    "the infinite set of feynman diagrams are sorted according to their chiral powers .",
    "the minimal chiral power @xmath46 of a given relativistic feynman diagram , @xmath47 is given in terms of the number of loops , @xmath48 , the number , @xmath49 , of vertices of type @xmath50 with @xmath51 small derivatives and @xmath52 baryon fields involved , and the number of external baryon lines @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "here one calls a derivative small if it acts on the pseudo - scalar meson field or if it probes the virtuality of a baryon field .",
    "explicit chiral symmetry - breaking effects are perturbative and included in the counting scheme with @xmath54 . for a discussion of the relativistic chiral lagrangian and its required systematic regrouping of interaction terms",

    "the @xmath55 or @xmath56 minimal subtraction schemes of dimensional regularization do not comply with the chiral counting rule @xcite .",
    "however , an appropriately modified subtraction scheme for relativistic feynman diagrams leads to manifest chiral counting rules @xcite .",
    "alternatively one may work with the chiral lagrangian in its heavy - fermion representation where an appropriate frame - dependent redefinition of the baryon fields lead to a more immediate manifestation of the chiral power counting rule ( [ q - rule ] ) .    in the @xmath57 sector",
    "the @xmath11 chiral lagrangian was successfully applied @xcite demonstrating good convergence properties of the perturbative chiral expansion . in the @xmath0 sector",
    "the situation is more involved due in part to the relatively large kaon mass @xmath58 . here",
    "the perturbative evaluation of the chiral lagrangian can not be justified and one must change the expansion strategy .",
    "rather than expanding directly the scattering amplitude one may expand the interaction kernel according to chiral power counting rules @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude then follows from the solution of a scattering equation like the lipmann - schwinger or the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "this is by analogy with the treatment of the @xmath59 bound - state problem of qed where a perturbative evaluation of the interaction kernel can be justified .",
    "the rational behind this change of scheme lies in the observation that reducible diagrams are typically enhanced close to their unitarity threshold .",
    "the enhancement factor of @xmath60 , measured relative to a reducible diagram with the same number of independent loop integrations , is given by the number , @xmath61 , of reducible meson - baryon pairs in the diagram , i.e. the number of unitary iterations implicit in the diagram .",
    "in the @xmath57 sector this enhancement factor does not prohibit a perturbative treatment , because the typical expansion parameter @xmath62 remains sufficiently small . in the @xmath63 sector ,",
    "on the other hand , the factor @xmath60 invalidates a perturbative treatment , because the typical expansion parameter would be @xmath64 .",
    "this is in contrast to irreducible diagrams .",
    "they yield the typical expansion parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 which justifies the perturbative evaluation of the scattering kernels .",
    "in our work we consider all terms of chiral order @xmath3 in the scattering kernel which are leading in the large @xmath4 limit . according to this philosophy loop corrections to the bethe - salpeter kernel",
