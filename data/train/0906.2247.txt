    "the x - ray emission of the order of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 from the galactic ridge ( gr ) in the energy range above 1 kev was detected almost forty years ago @xcite but its origin remains unknown till now .",
    "two possibilities are debated either this emission is really diffuse @xcite or it is due to an accumulative effect of faint x - ray sources @xcite . in the case of diffuse origin",
    "serious energetic problems arise if this emission is produced by non - thermal bremsstrahlung of high energy electrons , since the required power of sources of charged particles in the disk should exceed @xmath5 erg s@xmath4 , i.e. higher than the power of supernovae in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , this energy problem can be solved if the particles are in - situ accelerated from background plasma @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation of emission from gr was developed by @xcite who presented recently essential arguments in favor of the idea that the galactic ridge emission was due to cumulative emission of faint discrete x - ray sources .",
    "though this interpretation is not completely proved at present , it appears to be plausible .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath6  kev map of grxe as well as the 6.7 kev iron line distribution in the disk closely follow the near - infrared ( 3.5 @xmath7 ) brightness distribution which traces the galactic stellar mass distribution .",
    "this proportionality is the same in the disk and in the bulge . from recent suzaku observations",
    "it was concluded that the soft x - ray disk emission in the range 0.4 to 1 kev from the latitudes @xmath8 originated also from faint dm stars @xcite .",
    "very decisive analysis about the origin of the galactic ridge emission was provided recently by @xcite . from the chandra data they showed that most ( @xmath9% ) of the ridge emission is clearly explained by dim and numerous point sources .",
    "therefore , at least in the ridge emission , accreting white dwarfs and active coronal binaries are considered to be main emitters .",
    "the situation in the galactic center ( hereafter gc ) may be quite different .",
    "the gc region has been observed by x - ray experiments flown for almost 30 years ( see @xcite ) .",
    "ginga _ made a remarkable measurements of the spectra in this region @xcite .",
    "though as in the case of grxe , observations show there a significant contribution of discrete sources with luminosity @xmath10 erg s@xmath4 which contribute from 20% to 40% of the total flux @xcite , the origin of the rest of the flux is still unknown and essential distinctions were found between flux characteristics from grxe and gc .",
    "first of all , the gc emission is seen as a completely separated spherical region around sgr - a@xmath0 whose radius is about @xmath11  pc @xcite .",
    "the plasma temperature there is higher than in other part of the galactic disk .",
    "secondly , the ratios of 6.9 to 6.7 kev lines ( which traces the plasma temperature ) and 6.4 to 6.7 kev lines are higher in gc than in gr , while in gr this ratio is almost constant along the plane @xcite .",
    "thirdly , unlike the above - mentioned correlation of @xcite the x - ray source distribution derived from _",
    "deep exposure of the @xmath12-radius central region does not show any correlation with the distribution of 6.7 kev line @xcite .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the integrated flux of point sources contributed a rather small fraction of the total flux of gc x - rays and the major of emission from there is diffuse .",
    "this leaves an open possibility that the nuclear region of the galaxy ( within @xmath13 around sgr a@xmath0 ) may be somewhat different from the rest of the galaxy , and , therefore , processes of radiation there have an origin which differs from other parts of the galactic disk .",
    "this region is known , indeed , to be peculiar in many respects :    * the plasma temperature in the gc region is higher ( @xmath14 kev ) than in other parts of the galactic disk .",
    "such a high plasma temperature is surprising , since the gravitational potential in the gc region is no greater than several hundred ev which is too small to bind the gas .",
    "the plasma could not be gravitational confined and a very high amount of energy is required to maintain the plasma outflow .",
    "this energy supply can not be produced by sn explosions and other more powerful sources of energy are required to support the energy balance there ; + * gc region is a source of annihilation emission whose origin is still enigmatic . it may be explained either by emission of point sources like nova and supernova ( see e.g. @xcite ) or low mass x - ray binaries @xcite , or by dark matter annihilation @xcite ; + * intensive emission in x - ray iron lines is observed from the galactic center , which is often explained that the gas there was exposed in the past by sources of intensive x - ray emission e.g. from a supernova or from the galactic nucleus @xcite ; + * the temperature of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath15 ) in gc is unusually high , @xmath16  k. with the exception of sgr b2 no embedded source are observed inside clouds .",
    "therefore , a global heating mechanism is needed to explain the high gas temperature , e.g. by cosmic rays ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; + * the flux of vhe gamma - rays of unknown origin was discovered by hess in the direction of gc , which is supposed due to processes nearby the central black hole @xcite .",
    "as one can see , each of these observational phenomena can be explained separately by completely different physical processes which are not concerned with each others .    we assume , however , that these phenomena have common origin , namely , they are consequences of star accretion onto the central supermassive black hole .",
    "as our estimations showed the energy produced by accretion in the form of relativistic and subrelativistic particles is so high that it is inaccessible for any other sources of energy in the galaxy .",
    "another important characteristic of this process is that the energy erupted in gc is conserved there for rather long time because of relatively slow dissipation time of primary and secondary charged particles generated by accretion processes .",
    "we developed this model in series of papers @xcite , in which we interpreted the origin of annihilation emission and estimated the flux of gamma - ray de - excitation lines from gc .",
    "this publication is a continuation of these investigations .",
    "below we present a model of thermal and non - thermal hard x - ray emission from the gc which is supposed to be due to specific processes of accretion on the central black hole .",
    "we restrict our analysis by integral characteristics of this emission , its spatial variations are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we suppose to present such an analysis in our following publication . the goal of this paper is to demonstrate a principle possibility of of x - ray production in the gc ( thermal and non - thermal ) by subrelativistic protons at the level observed by suzaku .",
    "processes of injection of subrelativistic protons by star accretion were described in details in @xcite . here",
    "we remind only the main parameters of the process .",
    "every star capture by supermassive black holes releases a huge energy which is several order of magnitude higher than produced by a supernova explosion .",
    "the average frequency capture of one solar mass stars by supermassive black holes is about @xmath17year@xmath4 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as it was shown by @xcite once passing the pericenter , the star is tidally disrupted into a very long and dilute gas stream .",
    "approximately @xmath18% of the star matter was not accreted but instead became unbounded .",
    "this unbounded mass receives an additional angular momentum and escapes with velocities higher than the orbital speed that corresponds to the energy per baryon higher than @xmath19 for the mass of the black hole located in the center of our galaxy is about @xmath20  m@xmath21 ( see , @xcite ) it follows that the average energy of escaped particles may be more than @xmath22  mev  nucleon@xmath4 when a one - solar mass stars is captured ( see for details @xcite . here",
    "@xmath23 is the capture radius of a black hole given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the star mass and radius , @xmath30 the mass of the black hole , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the solar mass and radius .    for these parameters",
    "after every capture event about @xmath33 protons with energies @xmath1 mev escape into the surrounding medium whose temperature is @xmath34 kev and the uniform target gas distribution was assumed @xcite .",
    "the rate of their energy losses is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the proton velocity , and @xmath37 is the coulomb logarithm . since the lifetime of subrelativistic protons @xmath38 is about @xmath39 s.    since the proton lifetime is much longer than the characteristic time of star capture , the process of proton injection can be considered as quasi - stationary with the rate of proton injection in between from @xmath40 to @xmath41protons s@xmath4 ( or the energy input @xmath42 erg s@xmath4 ) .    the time - dependent spectrum of subrelativistic protons , @xmath43 can be calculated from the equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spatial diffusion coefficient of cosmic ray protons whose average value in the was taken to be @xmath46 @xmath47s@xmath4 in order to reproduce the suzaku data , @xmath48 is the rate of proton energy losses , and @xmath49 is the rate of proton production by accretion , which can be presented in the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the injection time .",

    "last suzaku observations of @xcite found a clear evidence for a hot plasma in the gc with the diameter about 20 acrminutes ( i.e @xmath65 pc ) .",
    "total x - ray flux from this region in the range 2 to 10 kev is @xmath66 erg s@xmath4 , total energy of plasma in this region is about @xmath67 erg .",
    "the temperature derived from the continuous spectrum is about 15 kev but such a high value may be a result of contribution from a non - thermal component of x - ray emission . indeed , from the 6.9/6.7 kev line ratio @xcite concluded that the spectrum in @xmath68  kev range was naturally explained by a 6.5  kev - temperature plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium .",

    "just this power can be supplied by subrelativistic protons which loose their energy mainly by ionization and thus heating of background plasma .    undoubtedly , this very crude estimate of temperature is severely limited . in order to describe the temperature and gas distribution in gc when the energy is sporadically released due to star",

    "we mention recent results of @xcite who simulated from 3d numerical calculations the dynamical structure of interstellar medium in star formation region with respect to the volume and mass fractions of the different ism `` phases '' . due to energy release from star explosions the medium is strongly nonuniform and turbulent .",

    "the fei k@xmath72 emission is associated with molecular clouds and therefore it requires a special analysis which will be presented in other paper .",

    "the he - like k-@xmath72 emission consists of emission lines of different transitions , and it might even contains emissions from li - like ions in ccd energy resolutions .",
    "the photon - weighted centroid energy of the emission depends on the ionization process ( e.g. collisional or photo ionization ) and the emission process ( e.g. thermal or non - thermal emission like charge exchange ) .",
    "the centroid energy derived from observation is consistent with that the gc plasma is in the collisional ionization equilibrium as it was claimed by @xcite .",

    "the contribution from subrelativistic protons was calculated for the spectrum derived from equation ( [ pr_state ] ) .",
    "we calculated the real plasma temperature for the plasma density which changes in the range from 0.1 to 0.4 @xmath64 .",
    "( 110mm,80mm)t(n)_new.eps    we see that the contribution from subrelativistic protons is negligible ( @xmath86% ) and the calculated temperature is close to the one derived by @xcite for the pure thermal case .",
    "the reason is evident , the energy of lines are close to the plasma temperature , therefore , these lines are mainly excited by thermal particles .",
    "we found that the value of the fexxv k@xmath72 line intensity for the case with the nonthermal component differs from the pure thermal case in a factor less than 1% while intensity variations of the fexxvi ly@xmath72 line are more significant , they are at the level of several percents .",
    "just variations of fexxvi ly@xmath72 line leads to a higher `` effective temperature '' ( @xmath87 kev ) for the case of nonthermal particles contribution .",
    "our calculations show that `` an x - ray signal '' from subrelativistic protons can be found at energies higher than 10 kev where the influence of thermal emission is insignificant .",
    "suzaku data of @xcite suggested that the continuum flux from the gc contained an additional hard component . up to recently any direct confirmation of nonthermal emission at energies above 10 kev has been unavailable . @xcite",
    "performed analysis of suzaku data and showed a prominent hard x - ray emission in the range from 14 to 40  kev whose spectrum is a power law with the spectral index ranging from 1.8 to 2.5 .",
    "the total luminosity of the power - law component from the central region ( @xmath88 ) is @xmath89 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the spatial distribution of hard x - rays correlates with the distribution of hot plasma .",
    "this spectrum can be represented by an exponentially cutoff power - law model , @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 varying from region to region over 1.2 - 2.2 and @xmath93  kev , respectively .    since the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) onboard suzaku is not an imaging detector , @xcite obtained the gc diffuse hard x - ray spectra by subtracting contamination fluxes from known bright x - ray point sources in its field of view ( @xmath94 fwhm ) .",
    "they considered contributions from those point sources with fluxes higher than @xmath95 ( or @xmath96 of a flux from crab nebula ) in the @xmath97  kev band , and subtracted them from observed spectra with assumptions such as their spectral shapes and fluxes are invariable during the observations . resulting energy spectrum of the gc hard x - ray emission observed by the hxd after subtracting bright - point - source contaminations",
    "is shown in figure [ x - ray ] by crosses .",
    "the residual spectrum still contains contributions from dimmer point sources ( @xmath98 in the @xmath97  kev band ) .",
    "therefore before comparing the spectral shape and the luminosity of our model with observed ones , we estimated the remaining point source fluxes in the hxd spectra .    by integrating a luminosity function of x - ray point sources in the gc regiondeg@xmath99deg scale around the sgr a*. ] over the luminosity range from @xmath100 to @xmath101 ( in the @xmath102  kev band ; a distance of 8  kpc was assumed ) , we obtain a dim - point - source contaminating flux of @xmath103  arcmin@xmath104 . in the estimation",
    ", we took into account the effective solid angle of the hxd / pin of 1220 arcmin@xmath105 , and assumed that a spectral photon index of the faint point sources is 1.5 .",
    "the value is on the order of 10% of the hxd / pin residual fluxes . if we further integrate the luminosity function , extrapolating the measured one with the same slope index down to @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the contaminating flux increase by 2.5 and 5.5 times ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 of the hxd flux ) , respectively .",
    "since a precise qualitative treatment of the contaminating point source flux is not a trivial procedure , we do not deal them further , and compare our model spectra directly with that of the hxd in the present analysis .",
    "interactions of subrelativistic protons with plasma result in production of bremsstrahlung photons ( inverse bremsstrahlung radiation ) .",
    "though the rate of these energy losses is negligible in comparison with the above - mentioned coulomb energy losses , nevertheless , these losses generate emission in the energy range higher than the thermal emission of background plasma and hence can be observed .",
    "subrelativistic protons generate bremsstrahlung photons with characteristic energies about @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the kinetic energy of protons and @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the masses of an electron and a proton . for the proton energies",
    "@xmath114 mev the bremsstrahlung radiation is in the range @xmath115 kev .",
    "the cross - section of inverse bremsstrahlung radiation is @xcite @xmath116 here @xmath117 .",
    "then the total flux of inverse bremsstrahlung emission from the gc can be calculated from @xmath118 where the @xmath119 is the volume of emitting region .",
    "( 110mm,80mm)xr_tst6.eps    the calculated x - ray spectrum of inverse bremsstrahlung radiation is shown in figure [ x - ray ] by the solid lines with points .",
    "the gc hard x - ray spectrum observed with the suzaku hxd shown by crosses @xcite was deconvolved to a photon - spectrum to perform a direct comparison with our model spectrum of inverse bremsstrahlung . in the deconvolution , as a rough approximation , we assumed a @xmath120 spatially uniform emission ( albeit in reality the surface brightness of the emission has spatial gradient centered on the gc ) . from spectral characteristics of the suzaku flux",
    "it follows that the energy @xmath121 estimated by equation ( [ esc ] ) is no smaller than @xmath122  mev , otherwise it is impossible to reproduce the suzaku data .",
    "the total spectrum with the contribution of thermal emission is shown by the solid line .",
    "the total flux of thermal component ( without absorption ) in the energy range above 10 kev is @xmath123 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the inverse bremsstrahlung flux for the same energy range is @xmath124 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "we notice , however , that this estimate of the nonthermal emission from the hot plasma in the gc is an upper limit of the model , because continuum emission generated by these protons in the molecular gas may contribute a significant part of the total flux ( see @xcite ) .",
    "besides , if a part of line emission comes from individual sources , the effect of the non - thermal proton becomes smaller .",
    "thus , the spectrum presented in figure 3 is the worst case for the model .    the calculated flux of inverse bremsstrahlung radiation from the @xmath120 central region is weakly sensitive to the average density of background plasma in the gc if the spatial diffusion coefficient of protons is small enough .",
    "the reason is that ( as it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ pr_state ] ) and ( [ int_ib ] ) ) the total flux of inverse bremsstrahlung radiation can be estimated as @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the characteristic times of ionization and bremsstrahlung losses of protons , and @xmath128 is the integrated power of proton sources . since both times are proportional to the plasma density , the inverse bremsstrahlung flux is almost independent of it .",
    "we notice a significant discrepancy between the gc hard x - ray emission and that of the grxe .",
    "the last one can hardly be due to inverse bremsstrahlung of subrelativistic nuclei since in this case the flux of carbon and oxygen de - excitation gamma - ray lines in the range from 3 to 7 mev is higher than the upper limit measured by osse @xcite .",
    "however , if the hard x - ray flux from the galactic center is due to inverse bremsstrahlung of protons with the derived spectrum , the flux of de - excitation lines is still below the osse level @xcite . in this respect common analysis of x - ray and gamma - ray data",
    "is crucial for the origin of hard x - rays from gc .",
    "we analysed the origin of x - ray emission from gc assuming that it is produced by subrelativistic protons generated by star accretion on the central black hole .",
    "the average power of energy release from accretion is about @xmath5 erg s@xmath4 and the average energy of emitted protons is about 100  mev .",
    "the energy of high energy protons is transformed into plasma heating by ionization losses . as derived by just this energy release",
    "is necessary to heat the plasma up to temperatures about @xmath2  kev , just as observed .",
    "additional ionization of iron ions by nonrelativistic protons can , in principle , violate the ionization balance in gc providing an excess of fexxvi ions that increases the intensity of 6.9 kev iron line .",
    "however , as numerical calculations show the excess due to ionization by subrelativistic protons is negligible for the 6.5 kev plasma temperature .",
    "a more significant effect from subrelativistic protons is expected in the x - ray range above 10 kev where influence of thermal emission is insignificant .",
    "we show that the inverse bremsstrahlung emission of protons in this energy range may produce a non - thermal x - ray flux . for the parameters of accretion",

    "<S> we analyse new results of _ chandra _ and suzaku which found a flux of hard x - ray emission from the compact region around sgr a@xmath0 ( r@xmath1 pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that this emission is generated by accretion processes onto the central supermassive blackhole when an unbounded part of captured stars obtains an additional momentum . as a result </S>",
    "<S> a flux of subrelativistic protons is generated near the galactic center which heats the background plasma up to temperatures about @xmath2  kev and produces by inverse bremsstrahlung a flux of non - thermal x - ray emission in the energy range above 10  kev . </S>"
