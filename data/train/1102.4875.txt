    "the @xmath4-algebras @xmath0 , @xmath5 were first defined and investigated by cuntz in his seminal paper @xcite , and they bear his name ever since . it is difficult to overestimate the importance of the cuntz algebras in theory of operator algebras and many other areas .",
    "it suffices to mention that cuntz s original article , @xcite , is probably the most cited ever paper in the area of operator algebras ( msc class 46l ) .",
    "indeed , as @xmath4-algebras naturally generated by hilbert spaces , the cuntz algebras continue to provide a convenient framework for several different areas of investigations . in order to illustrate the variety of applications , without pretending in any way to be exhaustive",
    ", we only mention a very small sample of papers dealing with fredholm theory , classification of @xmath4-algebras , self - similar sets , coding theory , continuous fractions , spectral flow and index theory for twisted cyclic cocycles , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this mainly expository article is devoted to recent advances in the study of dynamical aspects of the cuntz algebras @xmath0 with @xmath1 via their automorphisms and , more generally , endomorphisms .",
    "it is not a comprehensive review but a selective one , biased towards the contributions made by the three authors .",
    "some original results are also presented in this article , as will be explained later .",
    "systematic investigations of endomorphisms of @xmath0 , @xmath1 were initiated by cuntz in @xcite .",
    "a fundamental bijective correspondence between unital @xmath6-endomorphisms and unitaries in @xmath0 was established therein ( see equation ( [ cuntzendo ] ) , below ) . using this correspondence cuntz proved a number of interesting results , in particular with regard to those endomorphisms which globally preserve either the core uhf - subalgebra @xmath7 or the diagonal masa @xmath8 .",
    "investigations of automorphisms of @xmath0 began almost immediately after the birth of the algebras in question , see @xcite .",
    "classification of group actions on @xmath0 came to the fore somewhat later , see @xcite . in the present article , we review more recent results on automorphisms of @xmath0 contained in @xcite .",
    "proper endomorphisms of the cuntz algebras have also attracted a lot of attention . in particular",
    ", they played a role in certain aspects of index theory , both from the @xmath4-algebraic and von neumann algebraic point of view .",
    "the problem of computing the jones(-kosaki - longo ) index of ( the normal extensions ) of localized endomorphisms of @xmath0 was posed in @xcite .",
    "progress on this and other related problems was then achieved in a number of papers .",
    "of particular note in this regard are contributions made by longo , @xcite , and izumi , @xcite , but see also @xcite .",
    "there is also a parallel line of reasearch dealing with various entropy computations , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "recently , one of the most interesting applications of endomorphisms of @xmath0 , found by bratteli and jrgensen in @xcite , is in the area of wavelets . before that ,",
    "shift endomorphisms of cuntz algebras have been systematically employed in the analysis of structural aspects of quantum field theory , see e.g. the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) and references therein .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . after setting the stage with some preliminaries in section 2 , we discuss localized automorphisms in section 3 .",
    "localization refers to the fact that the corresponding unitary lies in one of the matrix algebras constituting a building block of the uhf - subalgebra @xmath7 . in section [ palt ] ,",
    "we review fundamental results about permutative automorphisms of @xmath0 , mainly contained in @xcite .",
    "the key breakthrough obtained therein was a clear - cut correspondence between such automorphisms and certain combinatorial structure related to labeled trees .",
    "this in turn served as a platform for further theoretical analysis , classification results , and construction of non - trivial examples .    in section [ pme ] , we present a more direct approach to finding automorphisms , based on solving certain polynomial matrix equations . even though these equations are relatively easy to derive , finding a complete set of solutions is a highly non - trivial task .",
    "section [ class ] contains a complete classification of those permutative endomorphisms of @xmath9 in level @xmath10 which are either automorphisms of @xmath9 or restrict to automorphisms of the diagonal @xmath11 .",
    "these results were obtained in @xcite and in the subsequent unpublished work @xcite , with aid of massive computer calculations .",
    "we also give tables summarizing the results of our automorphism search for all values of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 .    in section [ rweyl ]",
    ", we review very recently obtained description of the so - called restricted weyl group of @xmath0 in terms of automorphisms of the full two - sided @xmath3-shift , @xcite . on one hand , this result provides an answer to a question raised by cuntz in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it establishes a very interesting correspondence between an important class of automorphisms of a purely infinite , simple @xmath4-algebra @xmath0 and much studied automorphism group of a classical system of paramount importance in symbolic dynamics , @xcite .",
    "some aspects of this correspondence are related to the problem of extension of an automorphism from @xmath8 to the entire @xmath0 . a similar question for the uhf - subalgebra @xmath7 rather than the diagonal @xmath8",
    "was studied recently in @xcite .",
    "some recent results related to proper endomorphisms of @xmath0 are reviewed in section [ propend ] .",
    "subsection [ endpresuhf ] deals with those endomorphisms which globally preserve the uhf - subalgebra @xmath7 , while subsection [ endpresdiag ] with those which globally preserve the diagonal @xmath8 .",
    "the main theme in here is construction of endomorphisms which globally preserve one of these subalgebras but whose corresponding unitary does not belong to the relevant normalizer .",
    "the problem of existence of such exotic endomorphisms was left open in @xcite and remained unresolved until the recent works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if @xmath3 is an integer greater than 1 , the cuntz algebra @xmath0 is the unital @xmath4-algebra generated by @xmath3 isometries @xmath14 , satisfying @xmath15 , @xcite . then it turns out that @xmath0 is separable , simple , nuclear and purely infinite .",

    "it is the fixed point algebra for the gauge action of the circle group @xmath37 defined on generators as @xmath38 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath40 , the spectral subspace for this action .",
    "in particular , @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath4-subalgebra of @xmath7 generated by projections @xmath42 , @xmath43 , is a masa ( maximal abelian subalgebra ) both in @xmath7 and in @xmath0 .",
    "we call it the diagonal and denote @xmath8 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath8 is naturally identified with @xmath44  the full one - sided @xmath3-shift space .",
    "we also set @xmath45 . throughout this paper",
    "we are interested in the inclusions @xmath46 the uhf - subalgebra @xmath7 posseses a unique normalized trace , denoted @xmath47",
    ". we will refer to the restriction of @xmath47 to @xmath8 as to the canonical trace on @xmath8 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the group of those unitaries in @xmath0 which can be written as finite sums of words , i.e. , in the form @xmath49 for some @xmath50 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath48 is isomorphic to the higman - thompson group @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "one can also identify a copy of thompson s group @xmath52 sitting in canonical fashion inside @xmath53 .",
    "we also denote @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath55 , where @xmath56 are permutation unitaries in @xmath57 .",
    "that is , for each @xmath58 there is a unique permutation @xmath59 of multi - indices @xmath16 such that @xmath60    as shown by cuntz in @xcite , there exists the following bijective correspondence between unitaries in @xmath0 and unital @xmath6-endomorphisms of @xmath0 ( whose collection we denote by @xmath61 ) .",

    "composition of endomorphisms corresponds to a ` convolution ' multiplication of unitaries as follows : @xmath70 we denote by @xmath71 the canonical shift : @xmath72 if we take @xmath73 then @xmath74 .",

    "this is established through a repeated application of the identity @xmath86 , valid for all @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath89 for some @xmath12 then , following @xcite , we call endomorphism @xmath63 _ localized_. even though systematic investigations of such endomorphisms were initiated in @xcite , it should be noted that automorphisms constructed this way appeared already in the work of connes in the context of the hyperfinite type @xmath90 factor , @xcite .    for algebras",
    "@xmath91 we denote by @xmath92 the normalizer of @xmath93 in @xmath94 , and by @xmath95 the relative commutant of @xmath93 in @xmath94 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath96 the collection of all those automorphisms @xmath82 of @xmath94 such that @xmath97 , and by @xmath98 those automorphisms of @xmath94 which fix @xmath93 point - wise .",
    "in this section , we mostly deal with automorphisms of @xmath0",
    ". however , it may be useful to broaden our horizon for a little while and consider more general endomorphisms of cuntz algebras from the point of view of subfactor / sector theory .      since dealing simultaneously with all unitaries in matrix algebras is very difficult , in order to discuss interesting cases it is convenient to focus on some selected classes of unitaries which arise in specific situations like in the study of integrable systems .",
    "let @xmath99 be a hilbert space with @xmath100 .",
    "cuntz already noticed that unitary solutions @xmath101 of the quantum ybe ( without spectral parameter ) @xmath102 can be characterized in cuntz algebra terms as those unitaries @xmath103 in @xmath104 satisfying @xmath105 as a simple exercise , it is instructive to observe that no nontrivial unitary solution of the ybe induces an automorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , we claim that if @xmath106 then @xmath103 satisfies equation ( [ ybe ] ) if and only if of a localized morphism @xmath107 of the observable net @xmath108 indeed satisfies @xmath109 . ] @xmath110 . here",
    "one needs the composition rule of endomorphisms , namely @xmath111 , along with the characterization of self - intertwiners recalled in section [ endpresuhf ] below .",

    "it is well - known that finding all solutions of the ybe in dimension @xmath3 is a difficult problem that has been dealt with only for very small values of @xmath3 .",
    "this is closely related with the classification problem for braiding in categories of representations of quantum groups and/or conformal nets .",
    "it is expected that attaching to these solutions invariants from subfactor theory will lead to a much better understanding .",
    "other families of unitaries related to the study of spin / vertex models might also provide a useful playground :    * examine cuntz algebra endomorphisms associated to normalized hadamard matrices , cf .",
    "@xcite ; * discuss from the cuntz algebra point of view the tetrahedron equation and/or its several variations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    finally , it is worth to recall that a throughout discussion of localized endomorphisms associated to ( finite - dimensional ) unitaries satisfying the so - called pentagon equation ( which is a basic ingredient of quantum group theory ) has been provided in @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling . ] some results from @xcite .",

    "we denote @xmath122 . since @xmath123 , there are induced maps @xmath124 .",
    "we define @xmath125 as the subring of @xmath126 generated by @xmath127 .",
    "we denote by @xmath99 the linear span of the @xmath128 s .",
    "following @xcite , we define inductively @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "it follows that @xmath132 is a nonincreasing sequence of subspaces of @xmath133 and thus it eventually stabilizes . if @xmath134 is the smallest integer for which @xmath135 , then @xmath136 .",
    "the following result is contained in @xcite .    [ main ] let @xmath62 be a unitary in @xmath32 .",
    "then the following conditions are equivalent :    * @xmath63 is invertible with localized inverse ; * @xmath125 is nilpotent ; * @xmath137 .",
    "in the case of a permutation unitary @xmath58 , theorem [ main ] may be strengthened and very conveniently reformulated in combinatorial terms , as follows .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the corresponding @xmath63 is an automorphism of @xmath0 if and only if @xmath62 satisfies two conditions , called @xmath138 and @xmath139 therein .",
    "condition @xmath138 by itself guarantees that endomorphism @xmath63 restricts to an automorphism of the diagonal @xmath8 . for all @xmath12 , every permutative endomorphism of @xmath0 maps @xmath8 into itself . ] to describe these two conditions we will identify unitary @xmath58 with the corresponding permutation of @xmath16 .    for @xmath87",
    ", one defines a mapping @xmath140 so that @xmath141 if and only if there exists @xmath142 such that @xmath143 .",
    "then @xmath62 satisfies condition @xmath138 if and only if there exists a partial order @xmath144 on @xmath145 such that :    * each element of the diagonal @xmath146 is minimal ; * each @xmath147 is bounded below by some diagonal element ; * for every @xmath148 and all @xmath147 such that @xmath149 , we have @xmath150    for this condition ( b ) to hold it is necessary that the diagram of each mapping @xmath151 is a rooted tree , with the root its unique fixed point and with an edge going down from @xmath82 to @xmath83 if @xmath141 . by convention , we do not include in the diagram the loop from the root to itself .",
    "for example , if @xmath152 is viewed as an element of @xmath153 , then the corresponding pair of labeled trees is : @xmath154    to describe condition @xmath139 we define @xmath155 as the union of all off - diagonal elements of @xmath156 and one additional element @xmath157 . for @xmath158 , we also define mappings @xmath159 so that @xmath160 if there exists an @xmath142 such that @xmath161 and @xmath162 . otherwise , we set @xmath163 . we also put @xmath164 for all @xmath165 .",

    "it was shown in @xcite with respect to the case of @xmath172 , that no outer automorphisms apart from the flip - flop arise in this way for @xmath10 ( a much simpler case @xmath173 being already known ) . for @xmath174 , twelve new classes in @xmath175 were found .      in this section ,",
    "we gather together a few facts about pairs of unitaries in some finite matrix algebras giving rise to automorphisms of @xmath0 that are inverses of each other .",
    "we also briefly discuss interesting algebraic equations such unitaries must satisfy .",
    "these equations provide a useful background for the considerations in section 3 of @xcite ( e.g. theorem 3.2 , corollary 3.3 therein ) , which are reviewed in the present article in section [ palt ] above .",
    "they have also been useful for several other concrete computations in @xcite , e.g. in computing explicitly the inverse of @xmath176 , introduced and analyzed in section 5 , filling the tables of section 6 , and in the search of square - free automorphisms , @xcite .",
    "although these equations are not difficult to derive , we think that highlighting them may be of benefit , especially to the readers who do not use the machinery of cuntz algebras on the daily basis .",
    "so let us suppose that @xmath177 and @xmath178 are unitaries such that @xmath179 i.e. @xmath180 . and",
    "@xmath181 are injective , one identity implies the other .",
    "also , up to replacing @xmath12 and @xmath182 with their maximum , there would be no loss of generality in assuming that @xmath183 .",
    "however as the inverse of an automorphism induced by a unitary in a matrix algebra might very well be induced by a unitary in a larger matrix algebra , it seems convenient to allow this more flexible asymmetric formulation .",
    "it is worth stressing that , given @xmath12 , the subset of unitaries @xmath62 s in @xmath32 such that @xmath184 ( exists and ) is still induced by a unitary in @xmath32 is strictly smaller than the set of unitaries such that @xmath184 is induced by a unitary in some @xmath185 .",
    "an a priori bound for @xmath182 as a function of @xmath186 is provided in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.3 ) . ]",
    "this readily leads to a system of coupled matrix equations @xmath187 where both @xmath188 and @xmath189 are in @xmath190 . in passing ,",
    "observe that the second equation is independent of the level @xmath182 for which @xmath191 .    in practical situations ,",
    "one is faced with the converse problem . starting with some @xmath177",
    ", one might not know the precise value of @xmath182 , or even if the corresponding @xmath192 exists at all .",
    "it turns out that the existence of solutions ( for @xmath192 ) of equations ( [ coupled ] ) imply invertibility of @xmath63 . the following proposition combined with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.3 ) gives an algorithmic procedure for finding these solutions .",
    "we omit its elementary proof .",
    "let @xmath62 be a unitary in @xmath32 and suppose that @xmath193 for some @xmath182 .",

    "[ equ ] let @xmath62 and @xmath192 be unitaries in @xmath32 and @xmath185 , respectively , satisfying equations ( [ coupled ] ) . then @xmath62 is a solution of the following polynomial matrix equation @xmath200 where @xmath201 can be taken as maximum of @xmath12 and @xmath182 .",
    "conversely , given @xmath201 , every solution @xmath202 of equation ( [ necu ] ) gives rise to an automorphism @xmath63 of @xmath0 , with inverse induced by @xmath203 .    after some simplification , taking into account that @xmath202 , it is straighforward to check that the first nontrivial equation in the family ( [ necu ] ) , for @xmath204 , is @xmath205 i.e. @xmath62 commutes with @xmath206 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath207 , one obtains @xmath208 i.e. , @xmath62 commutes with @xmath209 .",
    "the strategy of applying proposition [ equ ] is to find all pairs satisfying ( [ coupled ] ) by solving equations of the form ( [ necu ] ) for all values of @xmath201 .",
    "implicitly , by solving such an equation , we predict @xmath192 to take a particular form , namely @xmath210 .",
    "however , we do not assume @xmath211 .",
    "in fact , @xmath192 automatically belongs to @xmath212 . combining this with equations ( [ coupled ] )",
    "we obtain an additional relation @xmath62 must satisfy , namely @xmath213 .",
    "we find it rather intriguing that in the case of permutation unitaries the polynomial matrix equations ( [ necu ] ) turn out to be equivalent to the tree related conditions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.12 ) .    of course , the above polynomial matrix equations apply to arbitrary unitaries in the algebraic part of @xmath214 and not only to permutation matrices .",
    "therefore , they can be used for finding other families of automorphisms of @xmath0 with localized inverses .",
    "it is to be expected that new interesting classes of automorphisms different from the much studied quasi - free ones will be found this way .",
    "it seems also worth while to investigate the algebraic varieties in @xmath215 defined by these equations . at present , we are not aware of occurences of these equations outside the realm of cuntz algebras but we would not be surprised if such instances were found .",

    "we recall from @xcite that @xmath239 is the normalizer of @xmath240 in @xmath241 and it can be also described as the group @xmath242 of automorphisms of @xmath0 induced by elements in the normalizer @xmath243 .",
    "furthermore , using @xcite , one can show that @xmath239 has the structure of a semidirect product @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the group @xmath245 is isomorphic with the quotient of the group @xmath246 by its normal subgroup @xmath240 .",

    "in particular , it becomes important to characterize those automorphisms of @xmath8 that can be obtained by restricting automorphisms ( or even endomorphisms ) of @xmath0 . as a variation on the theme , we mention the following    find necessary and sufficient conditions for an automorphism of @xmath8 to extend to an automorphism or a proper endomorphism of @xmath7 , respectively .    in @xcite ,",

    "the above theorem establishes a useful correspondences between permutative automorphisms of the cuntz algebra @xmath0 and automorphisms of a classical dynamical system .",
    "it opens up very attractive possibilities for two - fold applications : of topological dynamics to the study of automorphisms of a simple , purely infinite @xmath4-algebra , and of algebraic methods available for @xmath0 to the study of symbolic dynamical systems .",
    "thanks to a combined effort of a number of researchers ( see @xcite and @xcite ) several interesting properties of the group @xmath268 are known : it is countable , residually finite , contains all finite groups , and contains all free products of finitely many cyclic groups .",
    "however , a number of questions remain to date unsolved ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , is it generated by elements of finite order ? and most importantly , is @xmath268 isomorphic to @xmath269 ( as an abstract group ) when @xmath270 are prime ?    along with automorphisms of the two - sided shift , automorphisms of the full one - sided shift @xmath44 have been extensively studied ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . as shown in @xcite , each element of @xmath271 ( viewed as an element of @xmath254 )",
    "admits an extension to an outer permutative automorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to the following .",
    "[ extendautos ] there exists a natural ( given by extensions ) embedding of @xmath271 into @xmath262 .",
    "in this section , we mainly deal with proper endomorphisms of @xmath0 which globally preserve either the core uhf - subalgebra @xmath7 or the diagonal masa @xmath8 .",
    "two main references for the results reviewed below are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "cuntz showed in @xcite that if a unitary @xmath192 belongs to @xmath7 then the corresponding endomorphisms @xmath181 globally preserves @xmath7 .",

    "this is possible .",
    "in fact , one can even find unitaries in a matrix algebra @xmath32 such that @xmath282 is not contained in @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of such unitaries was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the relative commutant @xmath282 coincides with the space @xmath283 of self - intertwiners of the endomorphism @xmath63 , which can be computed as @xmath284 in @xcite , an explicit example was given of a permutation unitary @xmath285 and a unitary @xmath272 in @xmath286 such that @xmath287 .",
    "notice that @xmath288 naturally gives rise to a subfactor of the a.f.d .",
    "@xmath90 factor with finite jones index .",
    "an alert reader could spot intriguing resemblance of this problem with the classification of the so - called modular invariants ( see @xcite ) , although it is possible that this is nothing more than a formal analogy .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite a striking example was found of a unitary element @xmath292 for which the relative commutant @xmath293 contains a unital copy of @xmath172 . in this case",
    "the proof is non - constructive and involves a modification of rrdam s proof of the isomorphism @xmath294 , @xcite . as a corollary ,",
    "one obtains existence of a unital @xmath6-homomorphism @xmath295 such that @xmath296 .",
    "it is not clear though whether such a @xmath59 can be an isomorphism .",
    "cuntz showed in @xcite that if a unitary @xmath192 belongs to the normalizer @xmath243 of the diagonal @xmath8 in @xmath0 then the corresponding endomorphism @xmath181 globally preserves @xmath8 .",
    "the reversed implication was left open in @xcite .",
    "this problem was investigated in depth in @xcite .",
    "in particular , examples of unitaries @xmath309 such that @xmath310 were found therein , and the following convenient criterion of global preservation of @xmath8 was given .",
