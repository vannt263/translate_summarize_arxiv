    "with the lhc now running at @xmath7 tev and eventually running at 14 tev , new physics(np ) beyond the sm at the tev scale is expected to show up sometime soon . based on theoretical prejudice",
    "this np should assist in our understanding of the hierarchy problem and may be intimately involved in the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "although there are many speculations , it is not known what form this new physics might take with supersymmetry@xcite , extra dimensions@xcite and extended gauge theories@xcite being among the potential candidates .",
    "once the lhc discovers this physics the more difficult task of uncovering the underlying theory will still lay ahead . in all probability",
    "it is quite likely that the lhc may not provide us with sufficient information to address this problem in full detail and many in the community expect that the precision measurements available at a lepton collider , whose center of mass energy will depend on the precise mass scale of this np , will be necessary to provide the complete answer to these questions .    after the determination of its mass ,",
    "the most elementary and important properties of any new particle are its spin and the nature of its couplings to the familiar sm fields ; various tools will be necessary to obtain this information .",
    "the possibility of using transverse beam polarization in @xmath0 collisions to explore the details of many various np scenarios has now become rather well - established@xcite over the last few years .",
    "however , unlike in the case of the physics studies employing longitudinal beam polarization , to study np with asymmetries produced in the transversely polarized case both @xmath1 beams need to be polarized .",
    "the reason for this is that the corresponding asymmetry parameters , @xmath8 , associated with azimuthal angular distributions are directly proportional to the product of these two polarizations , , @xmath9 .   in this paper",
    "we will explore two scenarios in which transverse polarization can be used to obtain useful information about the properties of new particles in high energy @xmath0 collisions . to be specific",
    ", we will focus on very high energy collisions , @xmath2 tev , as are eventually envisioned at clic .",
    "we will assume that integrated luminosities in the few @xmath10 range are available and further assume that that the product of the magnitudes of the transverse polarizations @xmath11 , not an unreasonable value given the estimates for possible positron polarization , for purposes of demonstration .",
    "our philosophy in the preliminary studies presented here is _ not _ to ignore the well - known techniques that employ longitudinal polarization to address these issues but to explore instead the capabilities of transverse polarization to provide an alternative window into the same np .",
    "the first scenario we consider is new particle spin discrimination .",
    "as is well - known , measurements at lepton colliders provide at least two relatively straightforward ways to determine the spin of a particle which is pair produced in , , the @xmath12-channel . these techniques would then allow us to discriminate , , the production of susy particles from the kaluza - klein(kk ) excitations of universal extra dimensions ( ued)@xcite .",
    "first , a threshold scan would reveal a slow @xmath13 turn - on in the case of spin-0 sleptons and squarks , with @xmath14 being the particle s velocity , whereas the spin-1/2 kk excitations would instead have a @xmath15 behavior .",
    "second , far above the threshold region , the production of the spin-0 susy states would lead to a @xmath16 angular distribution whereas the kk states , being vector - like , would instead yield a @xmath17 distribution . in a classic work@xcite",
    ", it has been explicitly shown how such observables can be used at clic , running at @xmath18=3 tev , to differentiate @xmath19 gev smuons from the level-1 kk muons in ued .",
    "although these two techniques are powerful there could be situations where even observing these states associated with np might prove to be difficult@xcite so that it can be worthwhile having an additional tool at hand to assist in spin discrimination . as we will demonstrate below",
    ", transverse polarization can provide such an additional tool . to be specific",
    ", the analysis presented below is based on a few simple observations : ( @xmath3 ) the magnitudes of the transverse polarization asymmetries , @xmath8 , for scalars and vector - like fermions are large and are of opposite sign whereas @xmath8 for @xmath20-boson pair production , the largest sm background , is highly suppressed .",
    "( @xmath5 ) the @xmath21 dependence of @xmath8 for both scalars and vector - like fermions behaves as @xmath16 ; this also remains true in the cases of @xmath20-pair production to a very good approximation so that the signal shape is not distorted by the background .",
    "( @xmath22 ) suitable angular cuts can be used to remove the bulk of this @xmath20-pair background .    in the second scenario",
    "we consider the existence of a @xmath6-like state and ask the hypothetical question : ` what information about this state can be provided through the use of transverse polarization if it is employed instead of longitudinal polarization ? ' .",
    "as is very well - known , the existence of longitudinal polarization allows for the determination of the left - right polarization asymmetry , @xmath23 , as well as the polarized forward - backward asymmetry for any final state fermion @xmath24 , @xmath25 , from which coupling information can be extracted when combined with unpolarized data such as partial widths . here",
    "we will show that detailed measurements of the decay azimuthal angular distribution can be also employed to extract analogously useful information on the couplings of this @xmath6 state to the sm fermions .",
    "at clic luminosities ( @xmath26 ) and energies ( @xmath27 tev ) , kinematically accessible susy particles and kk excitations in ued are expected to produce rather significant event samples for detailed study unless these states are accidentally close to threshold .",
    "thus , statistics should not really be much of an issue in performing such analyses .",
    "for the specific cases of smuons and the level-1 kk muons in ued , these cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with that for @xmath20-pair production with both @xmath20 s decaying to muons which provides the largest sm background after @xmath28 initiated states are removed with the appropriate cuts .",
    "( in what follows it will be assumed for simplicity that both the smuons and the kk states will decay with 100@xmath29 branching fractions to muons plus missing energy . )",
    "collider . the corresponding cross section for @xmath20-pair production followed by their subsequent decay to muons",
    "is also shown ( solid line ) for comparison purposes.,width=321 ]    let us first consider the production of smuons ; ignoring for the moment small terms proportional to @xmath30 away from the @xmath31-pole , the double differential cross section is given by @xmath32\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the speed of the smuon as usual , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the vector(axial - vector ) coupling of the electron to the @xmath31 , @xmath36 being the electric charges of the electron and final state particle such that @xmath37 for any @xmath24 in the final state .",
    "here we have defined the familiar dimensionless quantities @xmath38 , ~~r_2=s^2/[(s - m_z^2)^2+\\gamma_z^2m_z^2]\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] employed in the coupling definitions above .",
    "we note that the @xmath40 and @xmath41dependencies of this distribution are observed to factorize in a rather simple manner .",
    "integration over @xmath42 and normalizing to the total cross section yields the azimuthal distribution @xmath43 where we have defined @xmath44 further separate integration over the ` odd ' and ` even ' regions where @xmath45 takes on opposite signs yields the transverse polarization asymmetry @xmath46 if we had inverted the orders of the @xmath42 and @xmath47 integrations we would observe that this azimuthal asymmetry itself has a very simple @xmath48 behavior : @xmath49 now let us examine the corresponding results for the case of the level-1 kk muons ; recalling that these are vector - like fermions we quickly obtain @xmath50+p_1^t p_2^t ( 1-z^2)\\beta^2f_b \\cos 2\\phi \\big)\\,,\\ ] ] where all of the quantities are as defined above .",
    "following the same procedure as in the case of smuons we find that for particles with the same electroweak quantum numbers @xmath51 with the asymmetry having same @xmath52 angular dependence as was found for smuons .",
    "thus both sets of particles yield asymmetries of comparable size but of opposite sign .    in the case of @xmath20-pair production",
    "the analogous differential cross - section can be written as@xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the corresponding , @xmath42-dependent , left- and right - handed helicity amplitudes .",
    "the resulting transverse polarization asymmetry is then found to be proportional to the ratio of the integrals over @xmath42 : @xmath55 now as is well - known , in the case of @xmath20-pair production , since the @xmath20 couples in a purely left - handed manner to the sm fermions we can ( symbolically ) observe that @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to a rather small value for the asymmetry since @xmath57 ; to obtain the corresponding @xmath58 distribution in this case , since it is defined relative to the total cross section , we simply omit the @xmath42 integration in the numerator above .",
    "one then finds that @xmath58 in the case of @xmath20-pair production also roughly behaves as @xmath59 at clic energies .    , for smuons and level-1 kk muons as a function of their masses at a 3 tev @xmath0 collider with the curves labeled as in the previous figure.,width=321 ]    fig .",

    "ordinarily , when we are performing the identical parallel study employing longitudinal polarization , we can freely choose this polarization to be right - handed to remove a very large part of the @xmath20-pair induced background ; we ca nt do that here so we need to resort to some other cut(s ) to remove the @xmath20-pair contamination .",
    "we recall , however , that the @xmath42-distribution for @xmath20-pair production , which for @xmath2 tev is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , is highly peaked in the forward direction .",
    "this means that the negatively charged muon from the @xmath61 will be correspondingly very forwardly peaked due to the large boost .",
    "on the otherhand , negatively charged muons arising from either the decay of the smuons or kk states will be just as likely to go in either the forward or backward directions since the angular distributions shown above for the production of pairs of these particles are seen to be even functions of @xmath42 . thus removing events with negatively(positively ) charged muons in the forward(backward ) hemisphere will reduce the signal by only a factor of 2 while substantially reducing the @xmath20 induced background . in",

    "if a new @xmath6-like resonance is discovered at the lhc , we will want to know all of its properties , in particular its couplings to the sm fields , as well as the underlying theory which gave rise to it .",
    "unfortunately , it is very likely that the lhc will be unable to perform this analysis in all generality , even if the @xmath6 is relatively light , due to the lack of a sufficient number of observables and limited integrated luminosity@xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the data from an @xmath0 collider will be crucial , especially so if the @xmath6 mass is within the @xmath18 range of this collider so that we can then sit on the @xmath6 pole .",
    "here we imagine that such a state exists with a mass of 3 tev ( or less ) and that we can sit on top of this resonance with clic .",
    "ordinarily , with longitudinal beam polarization , the following observables are available to perform coupling determinations for any final state @xmath24 : @xmath67 , the partial widths , @xmath68 , the forward - backward asymmetries , @xmath25 , the polarized forward - backward asymmetries and @xmath23 , the left - right asymmetry . if longitudinal polarization is _ not _",
    "available then we ca nt employ the last two observables and we need some ` replacements ' from obtained by the use of transverse polarization . to this end",
    "let us re - examine the normalized azimuthal angular distribution for massless fermions on top of the @xmath6 resonance ; the general form of this distribution is given by @xmath69 where the parameter @xmath70 , apart from a different choice of normalization factor , was described above .",
    "on the @xmath6 pole , we find that @xmath70 only depends upon the vector and axial vector couplings of the electron to the @xmath6 and in that sense is completely analogous to @xmath23 : @xmath71 here , and in what follows , a ( un)primed coupling is one that corresponds to a coupling to the @xmath72 .",
    "the parameters @xmath73 do not appear in the original expression for this distribution in the previous section since they originate from the absorptive part of the amplitude and are not significant away from resonances and were dropped in that analysis . on the @xmath6 pole , however , we find ( dropping terms that are subleading in @xmath74 ) , that @xmath75 which are parametrically ` small ' since the width - to - mass ratio for a typical @xmath6 is likely to be in the range of a few percent .",
    "however , given the anticipated clic luminosity the event samples are expected to be huge as the peak cross section ( _ after _ isr and beamstrahlung corrections are accounted for ) for the fermion @xmath24 is expected to be @xmath76 ab where @xmath77 are the electron and @xmath24 branching fractions of the @xmath6 . with this enormous amount of statistics , precision measurements of @xmath70 and the @xmath73 should be rather straightforward and it is likely that many of these and other observables on the @xmath6 resonance will become systematics limited .",
    "how sensitive are these observables to changes in the @xmath6 couplings and can they be used ( in conjunction with the with the unpolarized observables ) to obtain the parameters of the underlying theory ?",
    "this , of course , requires a detailed study but we can get a strong indication of what may be possible by looking at a few examples . fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the values of the observables @xmath70 and @xmath78 for the well - known set of @xmath6 originating in @xmath79 models@xcite .",
    "note that in such models , a single parameter , @xmath80 , controls all of the fermionic couplings to the @xmath6 .",
    "from this figure we see that these transverse polarization observables are quite sensitive to the value of this parameter .",

    "[ fig8 ] shows the values of @xmath70 and @xmath78 for this class of models .",
    "again we see that transverse polarization observables are quite sensitive to the value of @xmath83 through the various fermion couplings .",
    "clearly , these new observables do a respectable job at providing substitute coupling information to that obtainable from @xmath23 and @xmath25 when transverse polarization is available instead of longitudinal polarization .",
    ".,width=283 ]    .,width=283 ]    it is also interesting to consider what would happen if the new resonance were not a spin-1 , @xmath6 but were instead a spin-2 graviton kk excitation as in the original version of the randall - sundrum model@xcite .",
    "in such a case the on - resonance double differential cross section for a massless fermion in the final state would take the generic form @xmath84 + { { \\gamma}\\over { m}}p_1^t p_2^t f(z , v , a)\\sin 2\\phi \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is a rather complex function of the couplings and @xmath42 , from which we learn several things .",
    "most importantly , the @xmath42-dependence of the the unpolarized cross section and that of the @xmath45 part of the azimuthal distribution are seen to be identical which is somewhat reminiscent of the case of scalar particle pair production through @xmath12-channel spin-1 gauge boson exchange as was discussed above .",
    "secondly , we see that the value of the @xmath70 parameter is completely fixed , , it is universal and independent of the fermion flavor since gravitational couplings are universal in this scenario .",
    "thirdly , as was the case for the @xmath6 , a width - suppressed @xmath86 term is again present ( although we do not give its explicit form here via the function @xmath85 ) that depends upon the interference of the graviton with the usual sm @xmath87 and @xmath31 exchanges .",
    "clearly this graviton kk resonance will be easily distinguishable from a @xmath6 at clic .",
    "in this paper we have considered the further use of transverse polarization and the analogous azimuthal angular distributions as means to explore the properties of new states produced at the @xmath0 collider clic running at @xmath2 tev .",
    "here we have shown that ( @xmath3 ) transverse polarization asymmetries can be used as a discriminator of particle spin ; in particular , the two possibilities of smuon or ued kk - fermion pair production can be easily distinguished .",
    "( @xmath5 ) furthermore , we have shown that the general form of the azimuthal angular distribution , as measured on top of the pole of a new @xmath6-like state , can provide a powerful handle on the couplings of the various sm fermions to this new state in a manner analogous to observables employed in the case of longitudinal beam polarization . in both of these scenarios ,",
    "further work will be necessary to more fully understand the power of these observables in a clic - like detector environment including the influence of the full sm and other new physics backgrounds and the effects of the significant clic machine - induced beamstrahlung .",

    "<S> in @xmath0 collisions , transverse beam polarization can be a useful tool in studying the properties of particles associated with new physics beyond the standard model(sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike in the case of measurements associated with longitudinal polarization , the formation of azimuthal asymmetries used to probe this physics in the case of transverse polarization requires both @xmath1 beams to be simultaneously polarized . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the further use of transverse polarization as a probe of new physics models at a high energy , @xmath2 tev version of clic . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show ( @xmath3 ) how measurements of the sign of these asymmetries is sufficient to discriminate the production of spin-0 supersymmetric states from the spin-1/2 kaluza - klein excitations of universal extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the contribution to this asymmetry arising from the potentially large sm @xmath4 background can be made negligibly small . </S>",
    "<S> we then show ( @xmath5 ) how measurements of such asymmetries and their associated angular distributions on the peak of a new resonant @xmath6-like state can be used to extract precision information on the @xmath6 couplings to the sm fermions .    </S>",
