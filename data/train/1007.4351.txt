    "to describe relativistic fields , the null tetrad , or newman - penrose(np ) formalism@xcite , uses a set of four null spacetime vectors @xmath0 defined at every point in some region of spacetime . in the np formalism , rather than deal with the components of a tensor , say the maxwell tensor @xmath1 for electromagnetism , one uses the projections of tensors on this tetrad .",
    "because the tetrad field is chosen to satisfy certain properties , it turns out that the np fields , the projected quantities , are convenient for the mathematics of radiation fields",
    ". since the tetrad legs themselves have angular properties , projection with them adds some angular dependence not inherent in the physical field themselves .",
    "this additional angular dependence means that in general np fields should not be expanded in ordinary spherical harmonics .",
    "rather , all the simplicity of spherical harmonic expansions is regained if np fields are expanded in sets of angular functions called spin weighted spherical harmonics ( swshs)@xcite .",
    "swshs have recently played a significant role in research on cosmological anisotropies . the directional nature of linear polarization complicated comparisons of linear polarization in different sky directions , and limited polarization studies to small angular comparisons . in 1996",
    "seljak@xcite found that certain combinations of the stokes parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 were particularly well suited to dealing with the angular properties of linear polarization .",
    "this insight was still limited , as had been earlier work , to comparisons over small angular regions .",
    "that restriction was removed soon after in the breakthrough work by seljak and zaldarriaga@xcite in which swshs were introduced . there",
    "soon followed papers@xcite with further mathematical details of the use of swshs for cosmological anisotropies .",
    "this application of swshs to cosmology exploited their connection to the rotation group @xcite , rather than the role that the swshs typically play in physics . to our knowledge",
    ", none of the papers on the application of swshs to cosmological anisotropies makes reference to the np formalism itself .",
    "one of our purposes here is to show the very natural connection that exists . in this paper",
    "we introduce a np formalism for linear polarization and for stokes parameters , and we show in this formalism how swshs very naturally arise .",
    "we argue , furthermore , that the np formalism has advantages beyond that of giving an explanatory view of a technique already in use .    since we will only be considering a description of the fields at an observer location , not the propagation of the field , it is appropriate , for simplicity , to limit ourselves to the notation of special , not general relativity .",
    "but we make this simplification with some regrets since the np formalism is extremely useful for dealing with the propagation of fields in curved spacetime . for some problems in curved spacetime , in fact , it is almost indispensable .",
    "we will use the standard special relativistic metric with sign convention + --- and with the speed of light @xmath4 set to unity , so that in minkowski coordinates @xmath5 greek letters @xmath6 will indicate indices on 4-vectors , and latin letters @xmath7 will indicate indices on 3-vectors , also called `` spatial vectors . ''",
    "arrows over symbols indicate 4-vectors ; boldface symbols will be used for 3-vectors . for 3-vectors , such as the electric and magnetic vectors , subscript and superscript indices are equivalent since the bases used are orthonormal and the 3-metric is @xmath8 .",
    "the 3-vector components are equivalent to the spatial contravariant ( superscript ) components of a corresponding 4-vector .",
    "we use the same root symbol , @xmath9 , for the multipole index and for one of the null legs of the np tetrad .",
    "the difference will be clear from context , since in the latter usage it will either appear as a 4-vector @xmath10 or will be represented by its components @xmath11 .",
    "the situation we consider is that of an observer and an antenna at our coordinate origin .",
    "radiation from all directions arrives at the origin , although not necessarily isotropically .",
    "this radiation can be considered to be a distribution of plane waves , and we restrict attention to waves propagating in a narrow range of directions around some particular direction @xmath12 . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pvector ] , this direction can also be specified with the angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the cartesian components of the vector @xmath15 can be written as @xmath16 it will be very useful to have , in addition to the cartesian basis , a basis consisting of @xmath12 and the two orthogonal unit vectors tangent to the celestial sphere , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , as shown in fig .  [ fig : pvector ] .",
    "the direction in which an antenna must be pointed to receive this radiation is , of course , @xmath19 , so that the sky position the observer would assign to the source of this radiation is the antenna direction @xmath20 given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we now use the null tetrad to help in the discussion of radio waves propagating in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the np null tetrad consists of two real null 4-vectors @xmath10 and @xmath23 , and the complex null vector @xmath24 , which can usefully be considered to be equivalent to two null 4-vectors @xmath24 , and its complex conjugate @xmath25 .",
    "the four null vectors must have all dot products to be zero except for the dot products in the following normalization conditions @xmath26    in terms of the notation just defined , we choose our np tetrad to be the null vectors with the following contravariant components @xmath27 the minkowski components of these tetrad legs are @xmath28 it should be noted that all physical fields in the beam can be functions of spacetime location @xmath29 only through the combination @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the propagation 4-vector of the beam .",
    "it follows that for the beam propagating in the @xmath12 spatial direction @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . thus our tetrad leg @xmath10 is proportional to the propagation 4-vector @xmath31 .    in the np formalism",

    "any of the np projections is characterized by two important properties .",
    "the first is its _ spin weight _ , the number of @xmath24 vectors used in the projection , minus the number of @xmath25s used .",
    "this spin weight is connected to the spin weight of the swshs .",
    "in fact , swshs consist of sets of spherical harmonics of specific spin weights .",
    "a spin weight @xmath36 quantity must be expanded in spin weight @xmath36 spherical harmonics to realize the simplicity mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] . in view of the close connection of projected fields of specific spin weight , and swshs , it is understandable that the use of swshs in physics is traditionally associated with the np formalism .",
    "the properties of swshs have been described in detail both in connection with the np formalism@xcite and for use with cosmological anisotropies@xcite .",
    "we will not need those details here ; we need only the motivation that the swshs have turned out to be important in the description of the linear polarization of the cmb .",
    "the second important property of np fields is that each has a definite _ boost weight _ ( also called _ conformal weight _ ) .",
    "this is the number of @xmath10s minus the number of @xmath23s that are used in projecting the np field . just as spin",
    "weight determines rotation properties , the boost weight determines properties under lorentz transformations . by using the np description of linear polarization , as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : lorentz ] , it is straightforward to calculate the changes measured under a general lorentz boost .",
    "we note that the plane waves traveling in the direction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pvector ] must have their poynting vector directed in the @xmath12 direction , and hence must have @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 vanish , and all the electromagnetic information is carried in @xmath42 which reduces to @xmath43    in the description of stokes parameters a complex representation of the electric field is typically used . because the np quantities have their own complex nature , we avoid the more typical approach and describe a frequency component of the electric field as @xmath44 we next define a field that is phase shifted by @xmath45 : @xmath46    to construct the np quantities for radio astronomy we average over the range of frequencies of interest to form the following `` np stokes fields '' @xmath47 the angle brackets @xmath48 denote the average over some frequency interval . unless the radiation of interest is totally unpolarized we assume that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are not both zero .",
    "the first of these quantities is straightforward to evaluate with eq .   to show that @xmath51 the last symbol in this equation is the usual stokes parameter @xmath52 .",
    "( see , e.g. , sec .",
    "7.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . up to multiplicative factors",
    "this quantity is clearly just the intensity of radiative energy , i.e. , the magnitude of the poynting vector .",
    "the np quantity @xmath53 has spin weight zero , in complete accord with what one would expect on physical grounds , since the intensity , or temperature , is a scalar under rotations .    in terms of the electric field , the np quantity @xmath54 has the form @xmath55 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the usual stokes parameters of the radiation .",
    "( see , e.g. , sec .",
    "7.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . unlike @xmath53 ,",
    "the @xmath54 field has spin weight -2 , which means that an expansion of @xmath54 in functions on the sphere is best carried out with spin weight -2 harmonics@xcite .",
    "the fact that this spin weight -2 np stokes field ( or its spin weight + 2 complex conjugate ) carries the information about linear polarization explains the applicability of spin weight @xmath56 swshs to the studies of the linear polarization of the cmb .    in terms of the electric field",
    "the third of our np stokes fields is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the last of the usual stokes parameters . like @xmath53 , and unlike @xmath54 ,",
    "the field @xmath59 has spin weight 0 .",
    "the mathematical reason for this is that the stokes parameter @xmath58 is invariant with respect to rotations about the direction of propagation . like @xmath53 , the circular polarization measure @xmath59",
    "should be expanded in ordinary spherical harmonics .",
    "( we mention , only as an aside , that at present cosmological models do not include processes that produce circular polarization . )    all three np stokes fields have boost weight -2 .",
    "we will see below that the boost weight of an np quantity indicates the quantity s transformation property under a lorentz boost .",
    "in particular a boost weight @xmath60 quantity is multiplied by the doppler shift ( as defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : lorentz ] ) raised to the power @xmath60 .",
    "thus , all the stokes fields must be multiplied by the square of the doppler shift under a boost .",
    "this is in accord with the fact that all the stokes fields are quadratic in the transverse electric fields , which themselves are multiplied by a doppler shift factor under a boost .",
    "( an alternate viewpoint is that every photon is doppler shifted , and the rate of photon arrival is doppler shifted , hence all radiative intensities gets doubly doppler shifted . )",
    "here we consider the behavior of the np radiative quantities under a lorentz transformation , the transformation of measured quantities associated with a change of observer rest frame , in particular for a `` boost , '' a transformation from the reference frame of an observer to the frame of a relatively moving observer .",
    "transformations of stokes parameters have been considered by challinor and van leeuwen @xcite , who did not use swshs or the np formalism ; rather they confined their study to small angular scales .",
    "we show here that the np formalism removes the restriction of small angular scales for lorentz transformations , just as it does for angular correlations .",
    "the complete set of lorentz transformations of reference frame can be considered to be equivalent to the transformations of the null tetrad that maintain the conditions in eq .  .",
    "the group of transformations of the tetrad is usefully divided into several separate subclasses@xcite , as follows .",

    "they can be related to the usual boost and rotation parameters of the coordinate basis vectors of observers reference frames if a specific association is made between the null tetrad @xmath68 and the reference frame of an observer .    since the radiative quantities defined in eqs .",

    "we consider two relatively moving observers @xmath74 and @xmath75 , with 4-velocities @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and we focus our attention on a particular beam of radiation .",
    "the interpretation of the np stokes fields given in secs .",
    "[ sec : nprad ] requires that @xmath10 be in the null direction of propagation of the radiation and that @xmath78 .",
    "since we want both observers to be making the same physical measurements , only in different frames , we must have that @xmath79 is also in the null direction of propagation ( the same spacetime direction as @xmath10 ) and that @xmath80 . from the requirement that @xmath10 and @xmath79 be in the same null direction",
    ", we infer that the tetrads of the two observers must be related only by transformations of classes ii , iii , and iv , since the transformations of class i in eqs .",
    " , change the direction of @xmath10 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath81 must vanish and the relationship of the measurements of the two observers must depend only on the real parameters @xmath82 and on the complex parameter @xmath83 .",
    "an interesting conclusion now follows . as pointed out at the start of sec .",
    "[ sec : nprad ] , @xmath84 .",
    "the transformations in eqs .",
    " , with @xmath85 , then tell us that @xmath86 .",
    "this , of course , must be the case on physical grounds .",
    "furthermore , these relations tell us that the most general nontrivial transformation of @xmath42 is @xmath87 . for the np stokes fields",
    "this means that @xmath88    in a lorentz transformation , then , the polarization properties in @xmath54 are affected by both @xmath67 and by the @xmath66 parameter of a class iii transformation , while the other two np stokes fields , as well as the magnitude of @xmath54 , are affected only by @xmath67 .",
    "the detailed relationship of the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath66 , and the frames of observers , are given in appendix  [ genlxform ] .",
    "here we only give the result for @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath89 is the 3-velocity of a frame @xmath90 , as observed by @xmath74 , then @xmath91 this is the well known doppler factor that relates observations of radiation by the two observers , and is the ratio @xmath92 of the observed energies .    although the formal transformation properties in eq .",
    "are correct , they can not directly be related to observations of the cmb .",
    "the stokes parameters , and the np stokes fields , measure radiative power per unit area .",
    "radio telescopes , however , measure radiative power per unit area _ per unit frequency interval @xmath93 , per unit solid angle @xmath94_. in considering transformation properties we must take into account that @xmath95 thus , a radio telescope does not measure e.g. , the stokes parameter @xmath52 , but rather the specific intensity @xmath96 from the transformation properties in eqs .   and",
    "it follows that the specific intensity @xmath97 transforms according to @xmath98 we can apply this to the np stokes fields and can introduce measureable quantities @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , defined per unit frequency per unit solid angle .",
    "the transformation laws for these quantities are those of eq .  , with @xmath102 replaced by @xmath103 .",
    "these specific intensities are directly related to what is measured by radiotelescopes , but it is simple , and practical , to construct other quantities directly related to telescope observables .",
    "the specific intensities can be combined with the frequency at which the specific intensity is measured to form quantities @xmath104 , and the equivalent for np stokes fields .",
    "for these fields the transformation properties are @xmath105    in cosmology , the lorentz transformation properties of radiation quantities are important for transforming observations to a `` rest frame '' of the cmb . in principle",
    "this is the frame that must be used for comparisons of observations and theories of early universe processes .",
    "the general prescription for finding this frame is to identify a dipole in the radiation .",
    "a transformation can then be made to a frame in which this dipole vanishes .",
    "the process , however , is not unique .",
    "one can , for example , choose to elminate the dipole in circular polarization rather than intensity .",
    "the problem of finding a rest frame is essentially the problem of understanding how the radiation gives a representation of the lorentz group .",
    "the general theory of such representations can be based on the work of gelfand , graev and vilenkin@xcite and is sketched in appendix [ app : ggv ] . with this theory , lorentzian vectors and tensors",
    "are constructed from the multipoles , the 2-sphere integrals of radiation quantities .",
    "this issue of a choice of rest frames is taken up in greater detail in appendix  [ app : ggv ] .",
    "the introduction@xcite of swshs to the analysis of polarization anisotropy followed from a consideration of the explicit rotation properties of the stokes parameters @xmath106 and to the subsequent realization that a combination of the two had convenient transformation properties under rotation . we have shown here that the np formalism leads very naturally to an np formulation of the stokes parameters , and that in this formulation the use of spin weight @xmath56 swshs is immediate .",
    "we have also shown the convenience of the np formalism for `` boosts , '' the transformtion of radiation properties from an oberver s frame to the frame of a relatively moving observer .",
    "more specifically , we have shown that the np formalism allows for the computation of boosts of any radiation quantity without the limitation of small angular scale .",
    "the convenience of the np formalism is not a coincidence .",
    "its mathematical underpinnings are deeply rooted in the structure of spacetime , so the formalism is very naturally suited to the description of fields that propagate at the speed of light .",
    "this can be taken as the reason that stokes parameters arise simply as fields quadratic in the np field describing electromagnetic radiation .",
    "this even more certainly explains the relative simplicity of boost transformations .",
    "the brief discussion given of the nonuniqueness of the `` rest frame '' of the cmb is closely associated with the convenience of the np formalism for boosts .    since the advantages , or conveniences , follow from the appropriateness of the np formalism for fields propagating along null directions in spacetime , they apply also to non - electromagnetic fields . in particular , gravitational waves , whether the standard transverse - traceless waves of einstein s theory , or the full set of six possible polarization states , all have gravitational stokes parameters that follow from fields quadratic in the np projections of the riemann tensor .",
    "lastly , we mention that the np formalism is very naturally suited to calculations of the propagation of radiation in curved spacetime . in the cosmological context",
    "this means that the np formalism should greatly simplify , for example , the calculation of the effect on polarization of gravitational lensing or inhomogeneous cosmological expansion .",
