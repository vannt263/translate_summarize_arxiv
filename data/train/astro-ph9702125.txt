    "this is essentially a cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , but with a small matter content of hot dark matter ( hdm ) that lessen the fluctuations on small scales .",
    "the @xmath1 particles could fit both roles , the cold component acts as cold dark matter and the thermal component as hot dark matter .",
    "there are , however , several problems with this scenario .",

    "we describe a new way of producing neutrino lasing that is very similar to an atomic 3-level laser . here",
    "it is possible to achieve lasing without invoking new neutrinos and to increase the cdm fraction , which however still remains well below 70% .",

    "this is the only way of achieving lasing in the above 2-level decay .",
    "however , it is actually possible to obtain lasing with only the three known neutrinos .",
    "the effect is somewhat similar to an atomic 3-level laser , where particles are pumped from the ground state to the top level .",
    "from there they decay rapidly to the lasing state and from the lasing state they decay by stimulated decay to the ground state .",
    "exactly the same situation can occur for neutrinos if we have a three generation mass hierarchy , @xmath2 ( the stable particles @xmath32 and @xmath1 are of course required to have masses below the cosmological limit for stable particles , @xmath33 , and can therefore be considered essentially massless in the calculations ) .",

    "however , if all the decays are relativistic and the free decay of @xmath35 proceeds much faster than that of @xmath36 , then we can achieve lasing .",

    "of course , it is always a necessary condition for lasing to occur that @xmath36 decays relativistically because otherwise it can not populate low momentum boson states at all .",
    "we have investigated numerically the behavior of this 3-level decay for different parameters by solving explicitly the coupled boltzmann equations . our numerical routine uses a grid in comoving momentum space and evolves forward in time using a runge - kutta integrator .",

    "[ fig5 ] shows the effect of changing the relative mass of the two heavy neutrinos .",
    "we see here that to get a large cold fraction we also need to have @xmath56 .",
    "this is also understandable if we look at the allowed momentum range of the produced bosons from eq .",
    "( [ energyi ] ) @xmath57 . \\label{energyrange}\\ ] ] if @xmath58 is close to one we can get very cold bosons .",
    "this means that the bosons will tend to cluster in low momentum states , but because of energy conservation we get a very hot @xmath36 distribution . on the other hand , if @xmath59 , then the lowest boson states are unaccessible and we get instead a colder @xmath36 distribution",
    "this in turn leads to more lasing in the lasing state and even though the fraction of cold bosons coming from the initial @xmath35 decay gets smaller , this is more than compensated for by the larger fraction coming from the @xmath36 decay .",
    "this is indeed why the cold fraction increases when @xmath58 decreases .",
    "thus , if we want to study the region of parameter space with possible interest for structure formation scenarios we have essentially limited ourselves to the region of ultrarelativistic decays with a large mass difference between the two heavy neutrinos .",
    "it is also interesting to follow the evolution of the boson distributions with temperature to see how the different states populate .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the temperature evolution of the boson distribution for the decay parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "= 6.5truecm    the minimum possible boson energy at a given temperature is given by eq .",
    "( [ energyrange ] ) , where instead of @xmath35 we use @xmath36 and for @xmath58 we use 0 .",
    "an approximate lower limit can be calculated by setting @xmath63 , corresponding roughly to the mean value from a normal thermal distribution .",
    "this lower limit is an increasing function with decreasing temperature and indicates roughly the momentum where the distribution `` decouples '' ( decoupling here means that the states are kinematically inaccessible ) at a given temperature . for the model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we get @xmath64 for photon temperatures of 2.3 , 1.1 and 0.5 mev .",
    "we see that the lower limit at a given temperature corresponds roughly to the momentum where the distribution decouples .",
    "of course the lower limit will always be somewhat higher than the actual decoupling point , but it helps to understand the evolution of the spectra .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the corresponding evolution of @xmath36 .",
    "we see the before mentioned effect of @xmath35 decay producing a cold @xmath36 distribution and thereby enhancing lasing .",
    "= 6.5truecm    however , even in the case where the decays are ultrarelativistic and the mass ratio small , the fraction of cold bosons is only moderate .",
    "for example in the case where @xmath60 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the fraction of bosons with @xmath67 is only 44% .",
    "if the boson was to act as the dark matter in our universe , a much larger fraction would be needed .",
    "note , however , that even if the obtainable cold fraction is too small , it is comparable with or larger than that obtained in the model of refs .",
    "furthermore , it is achieved without invoking an unknown neutrino state .",
    "we have developed further the scenario originally proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite by introducing a physically different way of obtaining neutrino lasing .",
    "however , this model still suffers from one of the same shortcomings that the original model did , namely that it is impossible to achieve sufficiently large fractions of cold bosons for structure formation .",
    "an interesting consequence of the 3-level decay is that the number density of electron neutrinos is increased by a factor of almost three relative to the standard case .",
    "if the decay takes place before or during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , then it can significantly change the outcome because the electron neutrinos are very important for the neutron to proton conversion reactions .",
    "the higher than usual number of electron neutrinos will tend to keep equilibrium longer than in the standard case , meaning that less neutrons survive to form helium .",
    "the helium abundance will then be lower than in the standard case .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of low energy electron neutrinos is significantly higher than normal .",
    "this favors the neutron to proton reaction because of the mass difference between the neutron and the proton and leads to the opposite effect of the one described by gyuk and turner @xcite , where a massive @xmath17 neutrino decays to electron neutrinos , thereby enhancing the neutron fraction and allowing a very high baryon density without violating the bbn constraints .",
    "however , in their scenario , the decaying neutrino is non - relativistic and the resulting electron neutrinos therefore have very high energy ( the opposite of our case ) .",
    "decays producing lasing effects are , however , not likely to take place during bbn .",
    "the reason is that neutrinos are kept in equilibrium by the weak reaction until roughly @xmath68 .",
    "all neutrino distributions are then of equilibrium form and no lasing will take place .",
    "if the mass of any of the heavy neutrinos is of the same order or larger than this temperature , we will essentially have a non - relativistic decay after decoupling , but this will not produce lasing .",
    "thus , the heaviest neutrino in our scenario must be substantially lighter than 2 mev , thus making it improbable that it should decay during bbn .",
    "in general neutrino decays affecting bbn may well take place , but then they will not produce lasing effects .",
    "therefore we have not treated this case in the present paper .",
    "if we turn to more specific physical models , the most natural candidate for the light scalar particle , @xmath1 , is the majoron .",
    "there exist several majoron models , all of them designed to explain the very small neutrino masses compared to the other fermions . in the simplest models , the decay @xmath69 is forbidden at tree level @xcite , making the lifetime too long to be of interest . however , there are more complicated models where the lifetime can be short . in the simplest case the majoron couples to the neutrino via a yukawa interaction @xmath70 from this generic interaction several limits to the coupling strength ,",
    "@xmath18 , and therefore to the lifetime can be derived .",
    "for example neutrinoless double @xmath58 decays give an upper limit on @xmath18 of roughly @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "other limits can be derived from the neutrino signal of sn1987a @xcite , but as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is very difficult to get a clear picture of the current limits .",
    "a coupling constant of @xmath71 gives a restframe decay lifetime of @xcite @xmath72 this limit is rather weak and leaves open a large region of parameter space for relativistic decays in the early universe .",
    "note that for our model to work the decay @xmath73 must be suppressed .",
    "this corresponds to the coupling @xmath74 being very small compared to the other coupling constants .",
    "finally , we have assumed that the scattering and annihilation reactions between neutrinos and majorons are weak compared with the decay reaction .",
    "if , as we have assumed , the decay is not forbidden at tree level this is the case because the scattering and annihilations all are of order @xmath75 , whereas the decays are of order @xmath76 .",
    "were the annihilation and scattering reactions to be important we would not obtain any cold bosons because the low momentum states would not be decoupled .",
    "therefore , it is absolutely necessary that the decays are stronger than the scattering and annihilation reactions .",
    "note , that even if the decay is of order @xmath76 and the scattering and annihilation @xmath75 the decay rate will be damped by a factor @xmath77 which can be very large if the decay is extremely relativistic .",
    "thus , in the limit of @xmath78 we have to account for scatterings and annihilations , but @xmath79 would have to be extremely large because of the very small value of @xmath18 .",
    "as far as the neutrino masses are concerned , they are naturally explained by see - saw models .",
    "then only the lefthanded components participate in the interactions because of the very large mass of the right handed components .",
    "the possible majoron decays are then exactly @xmath80 as required in our lasing model .    in conclusion",
    ", what we have shown is that it is possible to generate large non - equilibrium effects , even starting from identical neutrino distributions .",
    "very few `` fine - tunings '' are necessary in order to achieve lasing .",
    "thus , these effects may be present many places in early universe physics , both because the decay types are generic and because the early universe is an inherently non - equilibrium environment .",
    "this was also noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , but our specific model shows that the relevant range of models is much larger than originally thought .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to search for other physical scenarios where the lasing process ( and other similar non - equilibrium processes ) may be effective .",
