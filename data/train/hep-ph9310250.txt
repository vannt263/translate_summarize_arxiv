    "in the last 30 years , a considerable amount of experimental information has been accumulated on the spectroscopy of hadrons .",
    "in addition to masses , electromagnetic , weak and strong decay widths have been measured to the extent that the most recent compilation @xcite contains many pages and a voluminous listing of decay modes of mesons and baryons .",
    "while the earlier data were analyzed in terms of symmetries , most notably the  eightfold \" @xmath1 flavor symmetry of gell ",
    "mann  @xcite and neeman  @xcite , in recent years there has been a tendency to analyze those data in terms of the non ",
    "relativistic  @xcite or relativized  @xcite quark model , in which a schrdinger  like equation is solved with some two  body quark  quark interaction @xmath2 .",
    "we have recently initiated a reanalysis of hadronic spectroscopy by reintroducing the concept of symmetry , now enlarged from flavor @xmath3  @xcite or flavor ",
    "spin @xmath4  @xcite to include the space part of the hadronic wave function  @xcite .",
    "we use an algebra @xmath5 that generates all excitations , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the space algebra , @xmath8 the spin algebra , @xmath9 the flavor algebra and @xmath10 the color algebra . the spin  flavor ",
    "color part is the same as in earlier analyses .",
    "the novel part is the use of a spectrum generating algebra for the space part which allows us to construct all states starting from the ground state .",
    "hence we are able to put into a single representation of the algebra @xmath11 all hadron states , including orbital and radial excitations and not just states with a given value of the orbital and radial quantum number .",
    "the purpose of our reanalysis is twofold :    ( i ) : :    we want to condense the information contained in the extensive    tabulations of ref.@xcite into a small set of parameters ; ( ii ) : :    more importantly , we want to identify  new \" physics , if any , which    emerges from the data set .",
    "if a data point deviates considerably from    the parameterization of ( i ) ( i.e. the symmetry is badly broken ) , and    this deviation can not be explained in a reasonable way , we take it as    indication that new physics is at play .    by new physics , in the present context , we mean unconventional configuration of quarks and gluons .",
    "these unconventional configurations are in many cases demanded by qcd and it would be quite surprising if they are not found ( or a reasonable explanation is not found for their absence ) .",
    "an example of these configurations are , in meson spectroscopy , purely gluonic states ( glueballs ) .",
    "unless a somewhat model independent framework is set up , against which the data can be compared , it would not be possible to identify uniquely those states which occur in a region of overlapping resonances .    in this article",
    ", we analyze strong two  body decays of @xmath12 mesons , and show that the known decay widths can be reasonably well summarized by a transition operator with only two parameters .",
    "this parameterization provides a description of the known widths within a factor of two or better , and thus we believe that it can make predictions of unknown widths with this accuracy .",
    "it would be of great interest to check these predictions by measuring some of the unknown widths .",
    "we find it particularly important that , by using space symmetries , the results for the decay widths can be written in a transparent way which isolates the various contributions : kinematic factors , spin  flavor part , and space part ( form factors ) .",
    "the space symmetry can be viewed as a way to generate the hadronic form factors in a consistent way .",
    "in this article , we consider all two  body decays of @xmath12 mesons where one of the emitted mesons is a pseudoscalar : [ dec ] m m + m  . in order to compute the strong decays ( [ dec ] ) ,",
    "we need the meson wave functions and the form of the transition operator .",
    "we use an algebraic construction of the wave functions .",
    "the spectrum generating algebra ( sga ) is = r_s _ f _ c , where @xmath13 is the space part , @xmath14 the spin part , @xmath15 the flavor part and @xmath10 the color part . following refs .  @xcite we take u(4 ) ,",
    "_ s su_s(2 ) , _ f su_f(3 ) , _ c",
    "su_c(3 ) , and consider only light quarks , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding wave functions are of the type = _ r _ s _ f _ c .",
    "the color part of @xmath19 does not play any role for @xmath12 mesons , as long as we construct color singlet states .",
    "the flavor part can be written either explicitly as @xmath20 for quark of flavor @xmath21 and antiquark of flavor @xmath22 , or as a @xmath3 wave function .",
    "the space and spin parts are coupled to total angular momentum @xmath23 , and written as n , f , l , s , j , m_j = _ m_s , m_l l , m_l , s , m_s j , m_j s , m_s f , l , m_l . here",
    "@xmath24 is a radial quantum number , @xmath25 labels the irreducible representation of @xmath26 ( i.e. the hilbert space on which calculations are performed ) and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath23 , @xmath29 have obvious meaning .    in order to study the decay widths in as much as possible model independent way , we consider two limiting cases of wave functions corresponding to the two dynamic symmetries of @xmath26 . .",
    "the first corresponds to the harmonic  oscillator quark model  @xcite , the second to a string  like situation  @xcite .",
    "the wave functions of chain @xmath30 are labelled by [ i ] n ,",
    "n , l , m_l , where @xmath31 is the harmonic oscillator principal quantum number .",
    "the wave functions of chain @xmath32 are labelled by [ ii ] n , v , l , m_l , where @xmath33 is the vibrational quantum number .",
    "the wave functions ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) differ in their radial part but have the same angular part , since @xmath34 is a common subalgebra of both @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the quantum number assignments of some mesons are shown in table i. another possible notation is the spectroscopic notation @xmath37 .",
    "we assume that the meson @xmath38 is emitted by quark @xmath39 or antiquark @xmath40 in meson @xmath41 which then changes to meson @xmath42 . in this picture , the quark contribution to the transition operator is of the form  @xcite [ op ] h=x^m_q_i q_i , where @xmath43 is the momentum of the emitted meson , and @xmath44 an @xmath45 flavor matrix corresponding to quark @xmath39 changing to quark @xmath46 with emission of meson @xmath38 ( fig.1 ) . the second term in eq.([op ] )",
    "is written in an unsymmetrized form since by commuting @xmath47 with @xmath48 one obtains a term proportional to @xmath49 which can be absorbed in @xmath50 . to eq.([op ] ) , one must also add the contribution from antiquarks [ opp ] h=x^m_|q_j |q_j .",
    "all two  body decays are thus given in terms of two parameters @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "the form ( [ op ] ) is common to both the elementary  emission model and the pair creation model of strong meson decays  @xcite , the only difference being the values of the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we assume that these decay constants are flavor independent .",
    "although our results can be easily generalized to the case in which the decay constants of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are different , we prefer , for the purpose of the present article , to keep the transition operator in its simplest possible form .",
    "all flavor dependence is thus in the matrices @xmath52 .",
    "the decay widths are computed from [ ampl ] ( m m + m  ) = k e_m",
    "m m ^2 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the total energy of the final meson and the mass of the initial meson . the ratio @xmath56 can be rewritten in a frame independent way as a function of the masses of mesons appearing in eq.([dec ] ) : [ chi ] = e_m = 12+m_m^2-m_m^2 .",
    "@xmath38 is taken to be the lighter of the two mesons in the final state .",
    "if the two mesons @xmath42 and @xmath38 are identical , an extra factor of @xmath57 is included .",
    "the operators ( [ op ] ) and ( [ opp ] ) are expressed in the quark basis @xmath20 , but can be easily reexpressed in the @xmath45 basis by writing @xmath52 in @xmath45 tensorial notation . in either case , while in the evaluation of the electromagnetic decays  @xcite the flavor part was trivial and all the complication was in the space ",
    "spin part , in the case of strong decays both parts require heavy algebra .",
    "explicit expressions for the matrix @xmath52 in the quark basis are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and they can be used directly for the evaluation of the matrix elements in ( [ ampl ] ) . if instead @xmath3 wave functions are used , the evaluation of the matrix elements in ( [ ampl ] ) requires the knowledge of the @xmath3 and @xmath58 isoscalar factors ( . )",
    "these are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have used both methods to evaluate the 25 strong decay widths shown in table ii .",
    "the use of both methods provides us with a check of the correctness of the results ( the two methods differ only by an overall normalization factor ) .",
    "the computed widths are written in terms of some kinematic factors , the spin ",
    "flavor part and the form factors @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the form factors @xmath61 contain all the information of the hadronic structure : they depend on the momentum of the emitted pseudoscalar meson @xmath62 and on the ratio @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the quark and antiquark masses of the decaying meson .",
    "this dependence naturally arises in the calculation of the radial part of the matrix elements .",
    "the expressions in table ii include the sum and averaging over the components of the final and initial states , respectively .",
    "the calculations of the space part of the matrix elements , @xmath66 for the first term and @xmath67 for the second term , are done using the algebraic method discussed in sect.ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is not repeated here .",
    "the relevant matrix elements are tabulated in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the widths in table ii are given in terms of form factors @xmath68 . by using algebraic methods , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , these form factors can be evaluated in closed form in three different situations :    ( i ) @xmath35 : : :    the @xmath35 form factors are given in table iiia .",
    "they are    all combinations of exponentials @xmath69 , and    polynomials in @xmath70 .",
    "these form factors are the form    factors of the non  relativistic harmonic oscillator quark model or    variations of it  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) @xmath36 : : :    the @xmath36 form factors are given in table iiib .",
    "they are    combinations of spherical bessel functions .",
    "these are the form factors    of a rigid string with quarks sitting at its ends .",
    "( iii ) @xmath71 : : :    a more realistic case is that in which the meson is emitted from a    string whose length is given by the probability distribution    @xmath72 .",
    "this produces form factors with    a power law behaviour for large @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding    expressions are obtained by replacing , in the @xmath36 form    factors , the spherical bessel functions @xmath73    by j_l(ak)= ^_0 d(e^-2/a)j_l(k ) .",
    "the integrated functions    @xmath74 are shown in table iiic .",
    "this situation is    denoted here by the @xmath71 .",
    "the three situations ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) represent three extreme situations which encompass a large variety of hadronic structure models .",
    "the form factors of each situations contain one parameter ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 or @xmath77 ) characterizing the average size of the mesons .",
    "the results of table ii can be used to analyze the experimental data .",
    "a least square fit to the available data gives the values of the parameters shown in table iv . with these values",
    "one can calculate the strong decay widths shown in table v. when several final charge states are possible , the appropriate isospin factors have been included going from table ii to table v. also , in calculating the values of table v the following mixing angles have been used _",
    "v=38^ , _ t=26^ .",
    "these values have been kept fixed .",
    "the value of the pseudoscalar mixing angle @xmath78 is consistent with that determined in ref .",
    "@xcite from a fit to the meson masses .",
    "the value of @xmath79 , when converted to the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath80 , which is somewhat different form the value @xmath81 of this reference .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath82 for the tensor mesons is the same as reported in @xcite .    in order to display clearly the situation ,",
    "we show in figs.26 a comparison between the experimental data and the calculations .",
    "one can see that the agreement between calculated values and experiment is in most cases good , with few exceptions discussed in subsections a and b below .",
    "one can also see that , within the range of momenta tested by the decays of table ii , the three classes of form factors produce similar results .",
    "this is part of the reason why the harmonic oscillator quark model , although in clear contradiction with experiment for large @xmath70 , provides a reasonably good description of known decay widths .    in view of the fact that the calculated values agree with the experimental values on the average within a factor of two or better",
    ", one can address specific problems related to meson spectroscopy .",
    "table v and figs.2 and 6 show that two of the calculated decays which are in bad agreement with experiment are : [ mix ] k_1^+(1270 ) & & ^0 k^+ , k_1^+(1400 ) & & ^0 k^+ .",
    "the quantum numbers of @xmath84 and @xmath85 are @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "the calculated decay widths can be brought into better agreement with experiment by mixing of the two states , [ angle ] k_1^+(1270 ) & = & ^1 p_1 + ^3 p_1 , k_1^+(1400 ) & = & - ^1 p_1 + ^3 p_1 .",
    "the mixing between @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be produced only by a tensor force .",
    "the decays ( [ mix ] ) provide therefore further evidence for the occurrence of a tensor force , similar to the evidence obtained from baryons ( mixing of @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "since one is looking for clues for the correctness of qcd in the non  perturbative regime , the decays ( [ mix ] ) appear to confirm the occurrence of a tensor force s_12=a , where @xmath90 is an operator of rank 2 acting on the spin variables and @xmath91 an operator of rank 2 acting on the space variables .",
    "the tensor force can be formally derived in qcd from one  gluon exchange .",
    "the value @xmath92 gives ( k_1(1270 ) ) k ) & = 15.3  mev , ( k_1(1400 ) ) k ) & = 5.2  mev , still not in complete agreement with experiment ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively ) , but in much better agreement than the unmixed values .",
    "the particular value of @xmath95 has been computed using the results of the @xmath35 fit , but similar results hold in the @xmath36 and @xmath71 symmetry .",
    "table v shows that the only other calculated decay width which is in bad agreement with experiments is f_2(1525 ) .",
    "the decays of @xmath98 and @xmath99 into @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 can be used to study admixtures of glueballs components into @xmath12 states .",
    "we shall readdress this question in a later publication where the mixing of @xmath96 , @xmath97 with the glueball candidate @xmath103 will be analyzed in great detail . here",
    "we only stress that the anomalously large deviation @xmath104 seems to indicate that other components ( @xmath105 or gluonic ) are present in the region of @xmath96 ( the calculated width of the @xmath106 decay could be brought into better agreement with experiment by using a different value for the tensor mixing angle , @xmath107 , but this mixing angle would produce a bad agreement of other @xmath98 and @xmath99 decays , expecially for @xmath108 ) .",
    "the two decays & & k^+ k^- & & k^0_l k^0_s provide a test of the kinematics used in the calculation .",
    "the matrix elements for the two processes are identical ( and for this reason the decay @xmath110 is not shown in tables ii and v ) , while the values of @xmath62 are slightly different , @xmath111 mev / c and @xmath112 mev / c respectively .",
    "the experimental ratio [ ratio ] ( k^+ k^- ) = ( 1.43 0.06 ) can be compared with that calculated in ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) : 1.534 ( i ) ,   1.535 ( ii ) ,  1.531 ( iii ) .",
    "the agreement is good , and practically the same in all three situations .",
    "this is an important point , because for decays of relativistic particles it is not at all obvious what kinematic factors should be used in connection with the transition operator @xmath113 of eqs.([op])-([opp ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that , in the early days of hadronic spectroscopy @xcite , the widths were calculated by introducing a form factor @xmath114 and a kinematic factor @xmath115 , i.e. ^l k m , where @xmath41 is the mass of the decaying meson , @xmath116 a measure of the size of the system ( @xmath117 mev / c ) and @xmath118 is the angular momentum of the decaying particle . the kinematic factor and form factor",
    "give , for the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) , @xmath119 , also in agreement with experiment .",
    "although not directly related to the results of table v , we comment briefly on another problem of interest which can be studied with strong decays : isospin mixing .",
    "the decay @xmath121 ( not shown in table v ) is forbidden by g  parity . however",
    ", a small mixing of @xmath122 with @xmath123 will allow the decay to go .",
    "from the observed decay width ( ^0 ^+ ^-)= ( 186.3 27.5 )  kev , one finds ^0 & = & 2.0^ i=1 + 2.0^ i=0 , ^0 & = & -2.0^ i=1 + 2.0^ i=0 .",
    "the value of the mixing angle @xmath124 is somewhat smaller than the value @xmath125 determined from the analysis of the radiative decays @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128  @xcite .",
    "the parameterization of the strong decay widths described here allows one to make predictions for unknown widths within a factor of 2 or better .",
    "these predictions can in turn be used to extract  new \" physics .      as an example",
    "we address here two problems : the so  called  problem of missing states \" and the nature of @xmath130 .",
    "we use the method of sect . 2 to calculate the decay matrix of @xmath129 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 into @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "the allowed decays of @xmath136 and @xmath137 are already given in table ii .",
    "the decays of @xmath138 are shown in table vi .",
    "the predicted decay matrix is shown in table vii , where we report the results of the @xmath35 symmetry ( the @xmath36 and @xmath71 situations have similar qualitative behaviour ) .",
    "we note that the decays which are experimentally seen are in excellent agreement with calculations , and that the fact that the transition operator of sect .",
    "2 gives ( a_1(1260 ) ) = 0 ( a_1(1260 ) k |k ) = 0 , is in agreement with the non  observation of these decays .",
    "most importantly , we find that the decays of the @xmath138 give a total width of about 420940 mev , for @xmath138 masses in the range 12001400 mev with two branches @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( since @xmath139 with the transition operator of sect.2 ) .",
    "this result suggests strongly that the @xmath130 , which has a total decay width of @xmath140 mev , is _ not _ the @xmath12 state @xmath141 .",
    "furthermore , the width of the @xmath129 state is so large that it might escape detection .",
    "this indeed may be one of the reason why some states predicted by models of hadron structure are either not seen or marginally seen ( missing states ) . the combination of the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , which predicts the state @xmath129 at 1273 mev and the present paper , strongly suggest that the state @xmath142 reported at the hadron 89 conference and omitted from the summary tables of ref .",
    "@xcite is a good candidate for the missing @xmath129 state .",
    "we have presented here a reanalysis of the strong decays of @xmath143 mesons similar in spirit to the earlier analyses in terms of flavor @xmath3 symmetry  @xcite , but where symmetries are also used to deal with the space part of the hadron wavefunctions . in particular , for mesons , we have used the spectrum generating algebra @xmath144 , and considered two branchings of @xmath26 , into @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the use of @xmath26 provides us with explicit expressions for the form factors , and thus allows us to compute analytically _ all _ decay widths .",
    "we note that the results of table v show that strong decay widths are not much dependent on models of hadronic structure ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath71 ) but they depend almost exclusively on the spin ",
    "flavor part of the meson wave functions .",
    "the parameterization of the decay operator ( [ op ] ) and ( [ opp ] ) appears to give all decay widths within a factor of 2 .",
    "having constructed the formalism for masses  @xcite , electromagnetic  @xcite , weak  @xcite and strong decays , we are now in a position to analyze any number of ref .",
    "@xcite , related to these quantities .",
    "deviations from symmetry parameterizations can be used to extract  new \" physics . particularly important in meson spectroscopy",
    "are the searches for gluonic components and multiquark configurations ( @xmath105 , @xmath145 ) .",
    "we believe we have now a method in which this search can be done in a somewhat quantitative way",
    ". we also find it important to test the accuracy of the predictions of this article and of ref .",
    "@xcite , by doing new experiments .",
