    "r0.4        hints of anomalous hadron production in @xmath0 interactions were first reported from studies made at slac and desy  @xcite .",
    "the first evidence for a large anomaly was reported by the l3 group from studies carried out at lep2 at 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "l3 reported data on inclusive @xmath3 production at values of @xmath1 approaching 20 gev / c .",
    "the data , shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , exceed the qcd prediction by about an order of magnitude at the highest transverse momenta .",
    "the @xmath0 interactions observed by l3 occurred in the process @xmath4 where @xmath5 were radiated by the incoming @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the radiative process was known to be a copious source of @xmath0 interactions  @xcite .",
    "events were selected by l3 in which the outgoing @xmath6 and @xmath7 emerged in the beam pipe of the collider and , although undetected , were known to produce almost real @xmath8 s .",
    "the @xmath9 events were identified by calorimeter measurements in which the total energy of emerging hadrons was significantly less than 200 gev .",
    "observations of @xmath3 production at lep2 have not been reported by other groups .",
    "however , data on @xmath10 production have been reported by both l3 and opal  @xcite .",
    "they are comparable to the @xmath3 data .",
    "both l3 and opal found significant excesses over the qcd prediction at @xmath11 gev / c .",
    "the excess reported by l3 is slightly greater than that shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] for @xmath3 production , whereas for opal the excess is slightly less .",
    "data have also been reported by l3 and opal on inclusive jet production  @xcite .",
    "the data by l3 extend to higher values of @xmath1 than those of opal , and they show a greater excess over the qcd prediction , reaching nearly an order of magnitude at 45 gev / c .",
    "most of the above datasets are displayed in  @xcite .",
    "the main source of background in the above experiments results from @xmath12 where initial state radiation reduces the invariant mass of the @xmath13 system to that of the z , and the @xmath14 emerges in the beam pipe and is undetected .",
    "hadronic decays of the z in these events can mimic @xmath0 interactions .",
    "however , z s produced as above are boosted to an energy of @xmath15 . both l3 and opal made cuts on the total energy observed in their calorimeters to remove the background .",
    "the high - precision calorimeters employed by l3 enabled them to place the cut at @xmath16 and maintain the background below 1%  @xcite . in the case of opal ,",
    "the cut was placed at a lower level , and/or extra conditions applied , resulting in analyses of greater complexity .",
    "r0.3        the measurements by l3 and opal are significant . according to the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the feynman diagram shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] applies when @xmath17 few gev / c  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude was therefore predicted to be proportional to the sum of the squares of the charges of quarks accessible at 200 gev , and the cross section expected to provide a simple but sensitive constraint on these basic charges  @xcite .",
    "the data are , however , inconsistent with the sm expectation . if valid , they suggest alternative models with larger charges .",
    "ferreira  @xcite considered a han - nambu model with unit charges and found improved agreement with the data , although the @xmath1 dependence was not perfectly fitted .",
    "he reviewed the extensive literature that exists on quarks of unit charges , and considered the production of b hadrons in @xmath0 interactions where a possible excess of data over theory was reported .",
    "he found this excess could be accounted for by unit charges .",
    "we note , however , that the aleph group subsequently reported a lower cross section for the production of b hadrons  @xcite .      before qcd was proposed , two theories of highly charged quarks were proposed , independently . in one ,",
    "quarks were proposed by schwinger  @xcite to be magnetic monopoles , in the other they were proposed by the author  @xcite to be highly electrically charged particles . in both cases it was assumed that strong electromagnetic forces between quarks accounted for quark binding , and that strong nuclear interactions between composite states occurred as residual interactions .",
    "colour charges were not included .",
    "both theories were based on eigenvalue equations for charge . in",
    "@xcite a modified version of dirac s eigenvalue equation for magnetic charge was assumed . in  @xcite a physical solution to a gell - mann - low equation",
    "was assumed . in both theories ,",
    "little progress was made in solving the field equations , because of the strong couplings involved .",
    "a generalized yukawa model  @xcite was proposed for  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "bare mesons and nucleons were assumed to act as partons of unit charge at low energies , thus avoiding the hadronization puzzle of the sm .",
    "large electromagnetic effects were anticipated to occur at the shorter scale shown in the figure .",
    "the possibility arises that the lep2 data are exhibiting the onset of large electromagnetic effects , because the @xmath0 amplitude is proportional to the square of the charges of the participating particles .",
    "measurements at higher energies would provide a clear test of this model .",
    "r0.4        the data shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] are similar to rutherford s old @xmath18-particle scattering data , here reproduced in  @xcite .",
    "both cross - sections fall in similar fashion through @xmath19 orders of magnitude .",
    "it was , of course , rutherford s data that supplanted j.j .",
    "thomson s model of the atom in which low - mass electrons swarmed in a cloud of massless , positive charge , a model that bears some resemblance to today s sm of the nucleon .",
    "in contrast , rutherford s nuclear atom bears more resemblance to particle models with highly charged quarks .",
    "we note that the latter require multiple generations of quarks that are not replications of one another  @xcite .",
    "they thus possess inbuilt symmetry breaking .",
    "current searches for the higgs boson may therefore be viewed as null tests of these models  @xcite .",
    "as remarked above , the @xmath0 interaction probes fundamental parameters of the sm , sensitively .",
    "existing data from lep2 by l3 and opal , whilst in approximate agreement with one other , are in serious disagreement with the sm",
    ". it would clearly be useful if the remaining lep2 groups ( aleph and delphi ) subjected their data to similar analyses .",
    "studies of @xmath0 interactions at higher energies would , however , be of greater interest , because neither the l3 nor the opal datasets reached asymptotic limits .    the international linear collider ( ilc ) and the compact linear collider ( clic ) would both be ideal machines for this purpose .",
    "plans for the former are more advanced , but both could be used to study @xmath0 interactions .",
    "purpose - built @xmath0 colliders would not be required .",
    "this has been amply demonstrated by the l3 and opal experiments . moreover",
    ", both ilc and clic could be operated as @xmath2 colliders . in this mode ,",
    "background from @xmath13 annihilation would be absent .",
    "the cuts on @xmath20 described in section 2 would not be required , and the full beam energy of the colliders could be utilised , thereby accessing significantly higher values of @xmath21 gev / c given sufficient luminosity .",
    "a plasma wakefield collider  @xcite could offer a more affordable means for carrying out the above program , especially if the higgs boson fails to materialize at fermilab and at the lhc .",
    "both electrons and positrons can be accelerated in plasma wakefields .",
    "however , an @xmath2 configuration would greatly reduce the cost .",
    "moreover , as remarked above , it would be subject to greatly reduced background .",
    "despite often - made claims to the contrary , e.g.  @xcite , the sm has not withstood every challenge .",
    "for example , yukawa s meson theory , confirmed by the discovery of the @xmath22-meson in 1947 , appears to lie outside the model .",
    "similarly , the lifetimes of the strange particles , also discovered in 1947 , lie outside the model  @xcite .",
    "a raison dtre for the strange particles has yet to be provided , and , conversely , glueballs have yet to be confirmed .",
    "the @xmath0 results present additional challenges .",
    "they are suggestive of alternative models with quarks of unit or larger charges , but further data at higher energies are needed .",
    "three machines would be capable of providing such data - ilc , clic , and a plasma wakefield collider . of these ,",
    "plans for the first are most advanced , but the last could eventually prove most affordable .",
