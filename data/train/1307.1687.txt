    "in a previous work ( * ? ? ? * ( fouchet  2010 ) ) , we ran full 3d , two - fluid smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of a planet embedded in a gas+dust t  tauri disk for different planet masses and grain sizes .",
    "the gas+dust dynamics , where aerodynamic drag leads to the vertical settling and radial migration of grains , is consistently treated .",
    "this produces gaps that are more striking and require a smaller planet mass to form in the dust phase than in the gas . in this work ,",

    "[ figopt ] , right ) to compare with previous alma predictions ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * wolf  2002 ) ) all made under this hypothesis .",
    "this assumption , producing much less defined gaps , with lower contrast , is anyway unrealistic and should not be used .    when including phase noise in median sky quality , our images show a substantial deterioration . however",
    ", this should not be an issue when observing in dry weather at short wavelengths and using water vapor radiometers providing real - time corrections .",
    "we find that gaps are visible at most disk inclinations : because of dust settling , the disk outer regions are not flared and do not hide them .",
    "planet signatures are fainter in more distant disks but declination has little effect on their detectability thanks to the excellent @xmath6 coverage of alma ( fig .",

    "gaps will be detectable for lighter planets than anticipated from gas - only simulations and a single 1-hour image can be sufficient to detect one and infer the presence of an unseen planet .",
    "characterizing it requires multi - wavelength follow - up and observing at short wavelength in dry weather is crucial to detect the inner disk and discriminate planet gaps from the inner holes of transition disks .",
    "alma should routinely observe signposts of planets in nearby star forming regions ."
