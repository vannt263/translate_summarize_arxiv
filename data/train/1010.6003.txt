    "ferroelectric antiferromagnetic crystals often have a weak spin - orbit induced ferromagnetic component .",
    "fennie @xcite has recently shown that for a particular class of these materials , a reversal of the ferroelectric polarization results in a reversal of the ferromagnetic polarization .",
    "this gives these materials potential device applications as well as scientific interest .",
    "unfortunately , the ferromagnetic moment is probably too small to be of practical use and the currie temperatures are usually well below room temperature @xcite .",
    "dzyaloshinsky @xcite postulated that weak ferromagnetism could occur only if the ferromagnetic state maintained the magnetic ( color ) group symmetry of the antiferromagnetic state . for a crystal with a trigonal axis",
    ", he found that @xmath1 was an allowed term in the hamiltonian which favored spin canting , where * s*@xmath2 and * s*@xmath3 are neighboring spins and * d * is a vector along the single trigonal axis .",
    "moriya@xcite then found a formula for * d*. we will show how the dzyaloshinsky - moria ( d - m ) theory manifests itself in a crystal with three 2-fold symmetry axes , _",
    "i.e. _ how is the 2-fold - axis along which the d vector points to determined ? does that axis depend upon the orientation of the spins prior to the inclusion of the spin - orbit coupling(soc ) ?",
    "bicro@xmath0(bco ) was first synthesized over forty years ago by sugawara _",
    "@xcite their finding of a triclinic low temperature crystal structure is , however , in conflict with some , but not all , more recent monoclinic determinations .",
    "there is a structural phase transition at about 430 k , above which it agreed @xcite that bco crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with the _ pnma _ space group ( no.62 ) .",
    "below 430 k x - ray powder diffraction patterns ( xpd ) were interpreted @xcite to yield a @xmath4(space group no.5 ) monoclinic structure .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry implies a ferroelectric crystal . while , on the other hand , two different neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) @xcite experiments led to the conclusion that , although the lattice parameters were almost identical to xpd data @xcite , the space group is the inversion symmetric @xmath5(no.15 ) .",
    "this coupled with the observed positions of the bi atoms lead to the conclusion that bco is antiferroelectric .",
    "g type antiferromagnetism is found @xcite to occur at about 110 k with a parasitic ferromagnetic moment whose remnant value is 0.025 @xmath6/cr .",
    "the magnetic moment on each cr atom was determined @xcite to be about 2.6 @xmath6 and to point along the _ b _ two - fold axis but to rotate by 50@xmath7 in the _ bc _ plane as the temperature is lowered between 80 k and 60 k.    kim _ et al . _",

    "@xcite ( mfll ) have grown films of bco with different results .",
    "klvc grew films between 200 and 1400 nm thick on srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) substrates with 8 nm thick epitaxial srruo@xmath0 layers as bottom electrodes .",
    "their x - ray diffraction studies revealed a tetragonal lattice with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "they find the curie temperature t@xmath10 = 140 k and a weak ferromagnetic moment ( fm ) of 0.012 @xmath11@xmath12/(f.u . ) obtained from a sample cooled down to a very low temperature in a 2 koe in - plane field .",
    "this weak fm can be compared with bulk crystal value @xcite of 0.025 @xmath11@xmath12/(f.u . )",
    "obtained from a hysteresis curve .",
    "they also measured _",
    "p(e ) _ , the electric polarization at 15 k as a function of a 1 khz applied electric field in the direction normal to the film , and obtained the doublely looped hysteresis curve characteristic of antiferroelectrics . at e = @xmath13700 kv / cm , where the _ p _ hysteresis loops closed , _",
    "p _ had the rather small value of @xmath1312@xmath11c/@xmath14 .",
    "the magnetic and electric polarization data reported by klvc were on films 750 nm thick ; which corresponds to a thickness of 1922 single f.u .",
    "unit cells .",
    "mfll grew bco films on laalo@xmath0 ( also on sto and ndgao@xmath0 but for which no data was reported ) .",
    "they obtained a triclinic structure with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 which is only a small distortion away from being tetragonal and in fairly good agreement with the original @xcite room temperature ground state measurement .",
    "they obtained a weak fm of 0.05 @xmath11@xmath12/(f.u . ) from their strongly hysteric curve . using piezoelectric force",
    "microscopy mfll find their film to be ferroelectric .",
    "this probably is consistent with their triclinic structure but they could also be observing a surface effect . except for a tem image of a 200 nm bco film , they did not report any film thicknesses .",
    "recently , david _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that , using x - ray diffraction and transmission electron diffraction at 300 k , they found three phases in bco films grown on sro .",
    "the two they were able to identify were @xmath5 and _",
    "pnma_. this is the first independent experimental confirmation that _ pnma _ bco can exist below 430 k.    there exist four calculations for bco of which we are aware , none of which contained the soc necessary to obtain the parasitic ferromagnetism .",
    "_ @xcite did the calculation for a hypothetical cubic perovskite structure .",

    "our goal in this paper is to confirm the structure of a thick epitaxial film and to determine its properties .",
    "we do this by keeping the lattice constants fixed at those of the epitaxial film and calculating the positions of the atoms in the unit cell , finding the same _ pnma _ structure as that when we allow the lattice constants to relax to their equilibrium values , and the same as the experimental high temperature phase . the equilibrium and epitaxial crystals are found to be antiferroelectric and antiferromagnetic , but",

    "the tilting direction depending upon a 2-fold axis along which the antiferromagnetic spins are originally aligned , but the direction of the d - m * d * vector is found to be independent of the original alignment .",
    "because the klvc magnetic and electric measurements were conducted on films 1922 single f.u .",
    "unit cells thick , we feel confident in treating these films as bulk crystals",
    ". calculations on the film were performed using the measured lattice constants , while determining the experimentally undetermined atomic positions within the unit cell.(by `` film '' we always mean relaxed atomic positions but unrelaxed experimental lattice constants . ) the calculation was then repeated with both the lattice constants and atomic positions relaxed simultaneously to determine the _ pnma _ ground state . for both calculations simulated annealing with no symmetry constraints was applied .",
    "these calculations were performed using the projected augmented wave method @xcite as implemented in the vasp code @xcite . for consistency with the international tables",

    "the four f.u .",
    "film lattice constants are @xmath20 and @xmath21 with _ a _ and _ c _ rotated by 45@xmath7 . the local density approximation ( lda ) for exchange and correlation(xc )",
    "was treated with the perdew - zunger parameterization @xcite with and without a hubbard @xcite _ u_-_j _ of 2.2 ev . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - wang 91 form @xcite , also with and without _ u - j _ = 2.2 ev was used as well .",
    "the outer core bi 5_d _ and cr 3_p _ electrons were treated as valence electrons .",
    "the energies with the soc included were calculated self consistently using the atomic positions and lattice constants determined without the soc .",
    "the atomic positions were iterated on until the largest force on any atom was 0.005 ev /  , resulting in a 10@xmath22 ev convergence of the total energy .",
    "( all convergence tests were done for the gga case . ) all energies and lattice constants are per four f.u .",
    "( 20 atom ) unit cell .",
    "we used a @xmath23 brillouin zone sampling throughout except in one case where a @xmath24 sampling revealed a convergence of 0.02 mev .",
    "a 500 ev cutoff in the plane wave expansion was used which resulted in the rather poor convergence of 70 mev in the total energy when compared with a 700 ev cutoff but a satisfactory convergence of 1 mev ( 2% ) in _",
    "@xmath25e _ , the bulk crystal energy minus the film energy .",
    "we do not discuss the bulk low temperature ground state because whether it is triclinic or monoclinic seems to depend on impurity content , imperfections , and domain formation , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    ".@xmath25e , the fully relaxed bulk crystal energy minus the film energy , in ev , calculated with four xc functionals . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we are now in a position to see how the d - m theory applies to the current case . we note that the _ a _ coordinate is unique in that no weak ferromagnetism is induced along it if the antiferromagnetic spins oriented along either of the other axes , or when _ a _ is the antiferromagnetic axis , there is no weak ferromagnetism along the other two axes .",
    "this uniqueness is a consequence of the different non primitive translations @xcite associated with the two - fold rotations about the different axes .",
    "the translations belonging to the _ b _ and _ c _ rotations interchange ( g type ) spin sublattices whereas the translation belonging to the _ a _ rotation does not . the unitary _ pnma _ symmetry is preserved only when the antiferromagnetic polarization is oriented along _",
    "a_. because each component _ m@xmath26 _ of the ferromagnetic vector * m * is rotated into _",
    "-m@xmath26 _ by one of the perpendicular two - fold rotations ( the nonprimitive translations have no effect on * m * ) , ferromagnetism is forbidden ( unless there is a broken symmetry ) .",
    "when the antiferromagnetic polarization is oriented along the _ b _ axis , the unitary group is reduced to @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29[@xmath30/2,0,@xmath31/2 ] , and @xmath32[@xmath30/2,0,@xmath31/2 ] .",
    "these four operations plus @xmath33 , the time reversal operator , multiplying the remaining four reflection and rotation operators , @xmath34[0,@xmath35/2,0 ] , @xmath36[0,@xmath35/2,0 ] , @xmath37[@xmath30/2,@xmath35/2,@xmath31/2 ] , and @xmath38[@xmath30/2,@xmath35/2,@xmath31/2 ] form the antiferromagnetic antiunitary group of the crystal .",
    "all eight operations leave the _ c _ ( but not _ a _ ) component of the spins sign unchanged .",
    "if the antiferromagnetic polarization is along _ c _ , interchange the _ b _ and _ c _ subscripts to obtain the magnetic group . then all eight operations leave the _ b _ ( but not _ a _ ) spin component unchanged .",
    "therefore , all operations of the magnetic group are consistent with weak ferromagnetism along the _ b _ or _ c _ axis , respectively , if the antiferromagnetic spin orientation is along the _ c _ or _ b _ axis .",
    "one can also show that the antiferromagnetic spin tilts belong to the magnetic group @xcite . if a d - m * d*@xmath39*s@xmath2*@xmath40*s@xmath3 * term is present in the hamiltonian , it is easy to see that * d * must be polarized in the * a * direction , irrespective of the orientation of the spins .    in summary",
    ", we have performed density functional calculations for a bco film with lattice constants determined by the sto substrate on which it was epitaxially grown as well as for a bulk crystal with relaxed lattice constants , and found in both cases that they have the _ pnma _ space group of the high temperature phase , indicating that the high temperature phase is stable ( when grown epitaxially on sto ) down to the 10 k to which the film was taken .",
    "we obtained a value for the mixed a and g type antiferroelectric bi displacements ; we found g type antiferromagnetism and if the antiferromagnetic spins were aligned along the @xmath41 axis a weak ferromagnetic moment was spin - orbit induced along the @xmath42 axis and if they were aligned along the @xmath30 axis there was no induced ferromagnetism .",
    "the uniqueness of the _ a _ axis was attributed to the nonprimitive translation accompanying its 2-fold rotation which does not interchange the spin sublattices .",
    "it was found that soc induced antiferromagnetic spin tilting , consistent with the magnetic space group , always occurred where ferromagnetic tilting did not .",
    "we showed how this could have been predicted from a theoretical analysis of the _ pnma _ group , and that * d * in the d - m hamiltonian must point along the * a * axis irrespective of the antiferromagnetic spin polarization , note , however , that does not account for the antiferromagnetic spin tilting .",
    "this work was supported by the texas advanced computing center tacc ) and by the welch foundation under grant no .",
    "y.y also thanks to nsfc ( 10674163 , 10974231 ) and the most project ( 2007cb925000 ) .",
    "the density functional error in the energy gap is usually about the same for gga and gga+@xmath47 .",
    "the difference here arises from the isolated band of d states which form the top of the gga dos . and which are pulled into the continuum below by @xmath47 .",
    "for example , consider the _ a _ component of tilt of the * b * oriented antiferromagnetic spins .",
    "cr1 goes into itself under the identity or inversion operation . under @xmath48 or @xmath32",
    "the sign of its tilt is reversed but it is translated to the oppositely tilted cr2 site . under @xmath49 or @xmath50",
    "the cr1 tilt is reversed and it is translated to the oppositely tilted cr4 site . and",
    "under @xmath51 or @xmath52 the tilt is unchanged and it is translated to the similarly tilted cr3 site ."
