    "supersymmetry@xcite is a leading candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) posits a spin zero partner for each sm matter field , and spin half partners for the gauge and higgs fields . while all the dimensionless couplings of the mssm are completely determined in terms of known sm couplings , the intractably large number of dimensionful soft susy breaking parameters is usually reduced by supplementing the mssm by simple boundary conditions for their renormalization group ( rg ) evolution@xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions are chosen so that flavour changing neutral currents ( which are generically large in a theory with many scalars ) are suppressed to acceptable levels .",
    "the boundary conditions are determined by assumptions about the new physics ( concerning mediation of susy breaking ) at a scale between @xmath6  tev and @xmath7 .",
    "various models ( msugra , low energy gauge - mediated susy breaking , anomaly - mediated susy breaking , gaugino - mediated susy breaking ) , each leading to a characteristic pattern of mssm soft breaking parameters , have been proposed and analyzed .    within the mssm framework ,",
    "neutrinos are massless and have no yukawa couplings .",
    "evidence from the super - kamiokande experiment@xcite strongly suggests that there are neutrino oscillations and , almost certainly , a neutrino mass .",
    "the favoured interpretation of these data is @xmath8 oscillations , with @xmath9  ev@xmath10 and near - maximal mixing .",
    "the see - saw mechanism@xcite provides an elegant way of giving small masses to neutrinos : for each massive neutrino , one needs to introduce a sm gauge singlet chiral superfield @xmath11 , whose fermion component is the left handed anti - neutrino .",
    "a mass term in the superpotential leads to a majorana mass @xmath12 for the singlet neutrino as well as a lepton - number violating mass for its scalar partner .",
    "this mass may be very large and is expected to be @xmath13 , or even @xmath7 if the right handed neutrino ( rhn ) is a singlet of the unifying gauge group .",
    "the neutrino also acquires a dirac mass @xmath14 , proportional to the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath0 , from electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the physical neutrino mass , which is obtained by diagonalizing the neutrino mass matrix , is then @xmath15 , and can be very small since @xmath14 is comparable to or smaller than the electroweak scale .    without further assumptions ,",
    "the neutrino yukawa coupling is arbitrary .",
    "however , in models where top and neutrino yukawa couplings unify at some high scale models since all the matter fields including the rhn belong to a single representation . in the minimal @xmath16 model where all the fermions get their mass from one higgs multiplet",
    ", all yukawa couplings are unified . in more complicated models where the masses of up and down type fermions arise from different higgs fields , we have unification of top and neutrino yukawa couplings , and separately unification of bottom and tau yukawa couplings . ]",
    "we expect @xmath17 , so that the physical neutrino mass is @xmath18 .",
    "renormalization effects@xcite modify this by a factor @xmath19 , but do not change the order of magnitude of the predicted neutrino mass .",
    "these effects are accounted for in our analysis .",
    "the introduction of the rhn@xcite and its associated yukawa coupling would change the predictions for @xmath20 and @xmath21 masses via new contributions to their rg evolution , but would not ( at one loop ) affect @xmath22 or other sparticle masses . moreover , if we assume that neutrino masses are hierarchical ( as they must be in the gut model with the simplest see - saw mechanism ) , the @xmath23 measured by the super - kamiokande collaboration is essentially @xmath24 , with the masses of other neutrinos being negligible in comparison .",
    "in the rest of this analysis we will therefore assume that , like quark and lepton yukawa couplings , the neutrino yukawa coupling of just the third generation is relevant .",
    "since this new coupling can affect just @xmath25 and @xmath5 masses , precision measurements of these masses in future experiments at @xmath2 linear colliders ( relative to @xmath26 and first generation slepton masses ) should yield information about @xmath0 .",
    "an examination of how large these effects might be , and an evaluation of the whether they might be detectable in the future , forms the subject of this study .",
    "the conceptually simple picture is spoiled by two important effects that are already present in the mssm .",
    "first , the usual tau yukawa interactions already split stau masses from those of other sleptons , and the effects of these depend on the unknown parameter @xmath27 whose value is difficult to pin down except under special circumstances ( _ e.g. _ when the masses of several higgs bosons can be measured@xcite ) .",
    "second , the same yukawa interactions also cause @xmath28 mixing , so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not the physical masses of the staus .    in the next section ,",
    "we identify slepton mass combinations that are sensitive to @xmath31 yukawa couplings but not to the usual tau yukawa interactions , and compare expectations for these within a reference model ( msugra ) and the same model extended by a rhn . in section  iii , we perform a case study to estimate the precision with which these variables might be measured at linear colliders in order to assess whether such measurements might be feasible .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "iv with a summary of our results and some general remarks about how our conclusions depend on the underlying model for neutrino masses .",
    "although we will limit ourselves to analyzing the effects of adding a rhn to the msugra framework , the ideas are applicable to any model with a well - defined prediction for slepton masses such as gauge - mediated or anomaly - mediated susy breaking models .",
    "of course , the extent to which the ideas can actually be implemented in experiments depends on how well these masses can be measured , and is thus sensitive to details of the model .",
    "the superpotential for the mssm with a singlet neutrino superfield @xmath32 ( for just a single generation ) , is given by @xmath33 where @xmath32 is the superfield whose fermionic component is the left handed anti - neutrino and scalar component is @xmath34 .",

    "@xcite , while the 2-loop ones are presented in ref . @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , sample sparticle mass spectra are shown with and without the effect of a neutrino yukawa coupling .",
    "the 1-loop rges for slepton and left handed sneutrino masses contain contributions from gauge interactions and from yukawa interactions .",
    "the former is generation independent while the latter is significant for just the third generation .",
    "furthermore , this yukawa contribution contains an additional term from the neutrino yukawa coupling if the model contains a rhn .",
    "we begin by defining the quantities @xmath39 where the @xmath40 denote the soft - susy breaking mass parameters . aside from @xmath41-terms , these are essentially the sparticle masses for the first two generations .",
    "this is not the case for the third generation because of effects of yukawa interactions . including effects from the rhn , the 1-loop rges for these quantities are given by@xcite , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "of course , below the scale @xmath12 the theory reduces to the mssm , and the last term in eq .",

    "( [ main ] ) is the starting point for our analysis . within msugra , @xmath48",
    "since the masses are degenerate at the gut scale and this quantity does not evolve at 1-loop .",
    "in contrast , for a model with a large rhn yukawa coupling , this quantity could evolve significantly between @xmath49 and @xmath12 .",
    "the value of @xmath50 at the weak scale is , of course , its value at @xmath51 , since it does not evolve for @xmath52 .",

    "we will return to this issue later . ] between @xmath58  gev and @xmath59  gev .",
    "for every set of model parameters , and for both models , we compute @xmath55 and plot it against @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dellr ] . of course",
    ", there is no rhn in msugra ; in the plot in frame ( _ a _ ) , each parameter set is randomly assigned a value of @xmath12 , resulting in the @xmath12 independent distribution of points in this case .",
    "the important thing to note is that @xmath60 is negative and typically smaller in magnitude than 0.01 in frame ( _ a _ ) , and essentially always smaller than 0.02 .",
    "in contrast , in models with a rhn , @xmath61  0.1 - 0.6 , except when @xmath12 is very close to @xmath49 in which case there is no range for rg evolution to occur .",
    "this is in keeping with expectations from a single step integration of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) which gives , @xmath62 assuming all susy breaking parameters with dimensions of mass are comparable .      while the idea described above is conceptually simple , the problem as we have already noted is that sm yukawa interactions cause intra - generational mixing and preclude direct determination of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and hence of @xmath55 .",
    "motivated by the fact that the lighter ( heavier ) tau slepton is mainly @xmath26 ( @xmath25 ) we construct new variables , @xmath63 that can , in principle , be directly measured in experiments at future linear colliders . since @xmath64 mixing is negligible , @xmath65 defined above is equal to @xmath66 , and we have only introduced it for notational reasons . unlike the case of soft masses where @xmath67 symmetry implied @xmath68 , we now have three logically independent `` flavour differences '' that can be formed ( see eq .",
    "( [ defn ] ) below ) .",
    "notice that the hypercharge @xmath41-term contribution to the masses always cancels as it is generation - independent .",
    "we can now form dimensionless differences @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 analogous to @xmath55 defined above : @xmath72 which , we emphasize , might be directly measurable . in the limit that stau mixing is negligible , the analysis should essentially reduce to that which was previously considered .",
    "the issue then is to examine how much stau mixing changes the variables @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 from their values ( close to zero in msugra ) in the absence of mixing .    toward this end , we show each of these quantities in fig .  [ fig : mix ] for the msugra model in the first column , and for the msugra model extended by a rhn in the second column .",
    "the plot is made in the same way as fig .",
    "[ fig : dellr ] .",
    "the following features are worthy of note .    *",
    "the spread of the points in the msugra model is considerably larger than in fig .",
    "[ fig : dellr ] . furthermore , as can most easily be seen from the out - liers , it is largest for @xmath69 and smallest for @xmath70 , and is always negative . *",
    "in contrast to the corresponding situation in fig .  [",
    "fig : dellr ] , we see that mixing allows some of the @xmath73s ( especially @xmath69 ) to become negative , and the very clean separation between the two models that we had in the previous figure no longer obtains . from the point of view of distinguishing the framework with a rhn from the msugra framework ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath70 is the most effective variable .    to understand why this is the case",
    ", we first write , @xmath74 and then note that @xmath75 ( since the sum of mass squared eigenvalues must be the trace of the stau mass squared matrix ) , and further , that each of these terms is negative because mixing always decreases ( increases ) the lowest ( highest ) eigenvalue .",
    "we thus expect that @xmath28 mixing effects reduce @xmath76 and @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mix ] relative to @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dellr ] , and further , that this reduction is in the ratio 3:1:2 . since these quantities are all negative within the msugra framework , @xmath70 in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : mix ] provides the cleanest separation .",
    "this then requires precise measurements of @xmath77 and @xmath3 , the prospects for which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "it is worth mentioning that stau mixing effects discussed above are absent in the quantity @xmath78 but its determination requires knowledge of @xmath79 and @xmath80 as well .    up to now",
    ", we have ignored the super - kamiokande measurement @xmath81  ev@xmath82  ev@xmath10 which , assuming an inter - generational hierarchy of neutrino masses , implies @xmath83 within the simplest see - saw model the neutrino mass is given by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the vacuum expectation value of the field @xmath86 responsible for the masses of up - type fermions in the mssm .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath0 and @xmath12 are strongly correlated .",
    "in fact , if @xmath87 then @xmath88 , so that values of @xmath89  gev are excluded by the super - kamiokande data . then , from fig .  [ fig : mix ] , we see that @xmath70 has to be determined to within 0.05 - 0.1 in order to distinguish the rhn model from msugra .",
    "we can , however , repeat the previous analysis ignoring the gut constraint on yukawa couplings and treating @xmath0 and @xmath12 as parameters of the rhn model , but instead constrain these to yield @xmath90 in the range ( [ superk ] ) . as before ,",
    "we generate random parameter sets for both these models , and then compute @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 introduced earlier .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neut ] . except for the more limited range of @xmath12 shown here ,",
    "the three figures in the first column are essentially the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mix ] , as should be the case since changing the assumptions about the rhn sector do not affect the msugra study .",
    "the results in the second column are , however , qualitatively different : the largest difference between the models now occurs when @xmath12 is close to @xmath49 .",
    "this is not difficult to understand . since we are holding @xmath91 ( roughly ) constant , @xmath0 is largest when @xmath12 is large , and decreases roughly as @xmath92 .",
    "if @xmath93  gev , the neutrino yukawa coupling becomes too small to have a visible effect on the sparticle masses .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath12 , @xmath94 grows very rapidly all the @xmath73s will vanish ( except for mixing effects ) because there is no rg evolution .",
    "the dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : neut ] terminate well before this because as @xmath12 increases , the value of @xmath0 becomes so large that it blows up before @xmath49 . in this case , the model is not shown . ]",
    "as long as @xmath12 is not too close to @xmath49 .",
    "stau mixing then reduces the @xmath73s shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neut ] exactly as discussed for the last figure .",
    "once again , @xmath70 offers the best separation between msugra and models with a rhn , and if @xmath12 is within a factor @xmath95 of @xmath49 distinction between the models may be possible if sparticle masses can be measured with sufficient precision .",
    "we find it exciting that , respecting the mass constraint , models with values of @xmath12 close to @xmath49 ( which theoretical prejudice might suggest are the most likely ) are the ones most likely to yield to experimental scrutiny .",
    "it is thus interesting to ask whether a subset of these models also satisfies the yukawa unification condition , and if so , examine whether this `` favored class '' of models can be distinguished from msugra .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nugut ] where we show @xmath70 for ( _ a _ )  msugra , ( _ b _ )  msugra + rhn with @xmath57 , ( _ c _ )  msugra + rhn with the neutrino mass constraint , and ( _ d _ )  msugra + rhn with @xmath57 and the neutrino mass constraint .",
    "the first three frames are the same as in previous figures and are only included for convenience .",
    "we see from frame ( _ d _ ) that it is indeed possible to find models where the neutrino and top yukawa couplings unify ( an @xmath16-like condition ) and the tau neutrino mass is in the right range .",
    "furthermore , the bulk of these models have large values  . ] of @xmath70 so that it is possible that linear collider experiments may offer a novel check of the simplest see - saw mechanism , if the relevant sparticle masses can be measured precisely enough .    before closing this section ,",
    "we briefly remind the reader that we had noted that stau mixing effects which are responsible for the few points in fig .  [",
    "fig : nugut]_d _ overlapping with the msugra region would be absent for the variable @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the dimensionless version of this , @xmath96 in principle offers the hope of an even cleaner separation between the two classes of models .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : clean ] where we plot @xmath97 for ( _ a _ )  msugra , and ( _ b _ )  msugra + rhn model with both @xmath57 and the neutrino mass constraint ( [ superk ] ) .",
    "we see a dramatic reduction in the spread for msugra models in frame ( _ a _ ) which then resembles the first frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : dellr ] , confirming that the spread in the other figures indeed originates from the mixing .",
    "frame ( _ b _ ) shows that none of the rhn models that we generated gives @xmath98 , so that the separation is theoretically very clean .",
    "of course , this measurement also requires a determination of @xmath80 and @xmath79 in addition to the other sparticle masses .",
    "we have seen that a determination of @xmath70 or , even better @xmath97 , offers an opportunity for detecting yukawa interactions of neutrinos , and further , for an _ independent _ confirmation of the simple see - saw mechanism for neutrino masses . in the simplest case where the neutrino and top yukawa couplings unify at the gut scale these quantities , which are zero in msugra , are expected to be @xmath99 , depending on the rhn model parameters .    assuming that sparticles directly decay to the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) which was taken to be the lightest neutralino @xmath100 , it has been shown@xcite that masses of the first two generations of charged sleptons and charginos can be measured at the 1 - 1.5% level if these sparticles are within the kinematic reach of @xmath2 linear colliders .",
    "an integrated luminosity of about 50  @xmath101 is sufficient to attain this precision .",
    "longitudinal polarization of the @xmath102 beam , which is crucial both to reduce sm backgrounds as well as to separate various susy processes from one another , is expected in all the current machine designs .",
    "subsequently , it was shown@xcite that this precision was not degraded even if sparticles decay via the complicated cascades@xcite expected in most susy models .",
    "indeed cascade decays are an asset in that they make it possible to determine , for instance , @xmath103 with a similar precision when @xmath104 is kinematically allowed@xcite .",
    "these findings have since been confirmed by more realistic studies@xcite .",
    "thus , whether or not @xmath70 or @xmath97 can be conclusively determined to be non - zero depends mainly on the precision with which the masses of third generation charged sleptons and sneutrinos can be measured .",

    "[ fig : tau1]_a _ is far from flat because of the energy lost to neutrinos . since higher energy taus , on an average , lose greater energy to neutrinos , the upper end point is greatly smeared .",
    "the loss of energy to neutrinos also means that there will be signal events below the lower end point .",
    "thus the kinematic end points do not play a role in a measurement of sparticle masses .",
    "nevertheless , the shape and normalization of the @xmath176 distribution is sensitive to @xmath105 .    to ascertain how well @xmath105 can be determined , we generated `` theory '' data samples ( each with about 80 times as many stau pairs as expected for the signal case for an integrated luminosity of 100  @xmath101 ) for several values of @xmath4 mass to determine the theoretical @xmath157 distribution after the cuts ( the solid histogram ) .",
    "we also generated a synthetic `` data '' set for an integrated luminosity of 100  @xmath101 ( the points with error bars ) . assuming that @xmath118 is well determined ( via a fit to the much larger sample of @xmath177 and @xmath144 pair events@xcite ) we can now fit the @xmath157 distribution from the `` data '' to the `` theory '' in terms of a single parameter @xmath105 .",

    "our results , are not incompatible with those of nojiri _ et al . _",
    "the slightly smaller error that we get may be attributed to the fact that we have assumed that the lsp mass is known% on @xmath182 .",
    "we will see shortly that a much larger integrated luminosity is needed for any measurement of the mass of @xmath5 . in this era , both the lsp and @xmath4 masses will be much better determined .",
    "] so that we could perform a single parameter fit , and possibly also because only @xmath183 decays were used in their analysis .",
    "the analysis of ref.@xcite suggests that it should be possible to measure @xmath3 in the same way that the electron sneutrino mass was measured .",
    "the strategy for this measurement was to focus on the sample of very clean events from the process , @xmath184 , where one of the charginos decays hadronically and the other leptonically . in this analysis ,",
    "the electron beam was taken to be left handed .",
    "there was very little sm background or susy contamination to this event sample , and a two parameter fit to the flat electron energy distribution yielded @xmath103 and @xmath117 with a precision of just over 1% ( 1@xmath180 ) .",
    "the same strategy suggests that we should focus on @xmath185 events from @xmath186 production , where @xmath187 , and study the ( visible ) @xmath107 energy distribution in this data sample ( but , of course , change the beam polarization to be right handed to reduce backgrounds ) .",
    "we attempted to do so ( again assuming the chargino mass will be well measured ) , but were unable to obtain significant discrimination between data sets with different @xmath5 masses .",
    "we found several factors which cause a difference from the study in ref.@xcite .    1 .",
    "first , @xmath188 is much larger than @xmath189 : for our case study we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : csections ] that this factor is larger than 100 . 2 .",
    "while the branching ratio for @xmath190 and @xmath191 are similar ( in fact the latter favours our case as we can use both @xmath192 and @xmath193 decays of @xmath194 ) , we now have to require that both taus decay hadronically ( a reduction to @xmath195 ) , and further , that both the tau jets pass the identification criteria to be identified as taus .",
    "3 .   not all the energy of the tau is visible . in particular , since the visible energy of the tau is reduced due to the escaping neutrinos , we found that the energy spectrum is frequently pushed well below our tau identification threshold of 10  gev .",
    "4 .   for a left",
    "handed electron beam @xmath188 is much larger than other susy cross sections , so that the event sample is very much dominated by the sneutrino signal .",
    "this is not quite the case for @xmath5 pair production ; we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : csections ] that heavier chargino and neutralino production as well as @xmath196 production may make significant contributions to this event topology .",
    "the first two items greatly reduce the number of signal events increasing the statistical error .",
    "the last item causes contamination of the sample .",
    "the energy loss due to the escaping neutrinos discussed in item ( 3 ) causes the energy distributions with different @xmath3 to resemble one another beyond @xmath197  gev more closely than they would if the full @xmath107 energy could be measured .",
    "the point is that the cut on the tau energy cuts out fewer events when the mass gap between @xmath5 and @xmath194 increases ; _ i.e. _ for heavier sneutrinos , assuming as we do that the chargino mass is fixed .",
    "but the sneutrino production cross section reduces for larger sneutrino mass . as a result",
    ", these two effects compensate , reducing the discrimination between different sneutrino mass cases . in an analysis similar to the one for @xmath105 determination discussed above .",
    "] we also examined other decay chains ( with just one identified @xmath107 ) but found that these generally suffered from large contamination from other susy sources .",
    "we conclude that this strategy is not suitable for such a measurement even with an integrated luminostiy of 500 - 1000  @xmath101 .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section provides an alternative way to measure the sneutrino mass .",
    "since we have not taken bremsstrahlung or beamsstrahlung into account , we are careful not to go very close to the kinematic threshold where the cross section would be most strongly affected by soft photon emission .",
    "away from the threshold , we expect that beamsstrahlung effects may reduce the cross section by @xmath198% , but presumably without greatly altering its energy dependence .",
    "the total cross section for @xmath199 events from all susy sources is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snuall]_a _ for the signal point with @xmath200  gev , as well as for two other values of the sneutrino mass . here , we have required that each @xmath107 jet has @xmath201  gev .",

    "sm physics backgrounds are expected to be small .",
    "the error bars correspond to an integrated luminosity of 200  @xmath101 for each energy . for the contamination from susy events",

    "is shown in table  [ back ] for the energy range in fig .",
    "[ fig : snuall ] .",
    "we see that the contribution from @xmath196 production is always much smaller than that from charginos and neutralinos . for this case ,",

    "gev is due to the opening up of heavy neutralino and chargino pair production thresholds .",
    "to get an idea of how well cross sections can distinguish different sneutrino masses , we perform a monte carlo computation of the cross section for several values of sneutrino mass for energies ranging between 425  gev and 600  gev in steps of 25  gev .",
    "we generate about @xmath58 susy events which is about 30 times the number of signal events expected for an integrated luminosity of 200  @xmath101 . for each value of @xmath3 that we consider , we then compute @xmath206 between the energy dependence of the cross section for the case study point and the corresponding quantity for some other @xmath5 mass .",

    "the solid ( dashed ) curves are a fit through the circles ( triangles ) . using these fits , we see that the sneutrino mass is obtained as @xmath208  gev ( @xmath209  gev ) for an integrated luminosity of 100  @xmath101 ( 200  @xmath101 ) at the 90% cl .",

    "it is worth keeping in mind that new developments ( _ e.g. _ vertex detection , neural net algorithms , or something else ) will , quite possibly , result in a significantly higher efficiency for tau identification than assumed in our analysis . in this case , the integrated luminosity required will be correspondingly reduced .",
    "our purpose , however , is not to imply that @xmath5 mass measurement is possible , but to clarify just how challenging such a measurement might be .",
    "the analysis above assumes that it would not be possible to sort out chargino and neutralino events from @xmath5 events .",
    "since the heavier chargino @xmath210 and the heavier neutralinos @xmath211 dominantly decay to real @xmath212 , @xmath213 or @xmath214 and light charginos and neutralinos , it might be conceivable that by the time such large data samples become available , experimentalists might have learnt to recognize ( the bulk of ) @xmath194 and @xmath175 , in the same way that they recognize @xmath215-jets and @xmath107-leptons today . alternatively , although the case study point allows for heavy chargino and neutralino production , it could be that for another point , susy contamination from these sources is kinematically supppressed . in either case",

    "these measurements do not give as sharp a distinction for sneutrinos lighter than the test case .",
    "for this case then , measurements at the high energy end improve the discrimination .",

    "indeed , we see that the two curves match at the high mass end , but including the 575 and 600  gev bins significantly improves the discrimination for lower values of @xmath115 .",
    "we see that if susy backgrounds can be controlled , a sneutrino mass measurement of comparable precision as in fig .  [ fig : snuall ] might be possible with half the integrated luminosity .",

    "alternatively , if we can distinguish chargino / neutralino from sneutrino initiated events without substantial loss of signal , a similar precision might be possible with just half this luminosity",
    ". we should remember that we are conservatively quoting 90% cl and not 1@xmath180 errors , partly because of the simplified way that we have done our calculation .",

    "the dominant decays lead to @xmath223 events which have a large contamination from @xmath144 production .",
    "this could be reduced by using a right handed electron beam , but even for 95% polarization , the cross section from direct chargino production exceeds that for chargino production via heavy stau pair production a factor of about 3 . moreover",
    ", other susy sources ( @xmath145 , @xmath224 and even @xmath186 production ) could contaminate the signal especially from hadronic decays of daughter charginos .",
    "while it is possible that a clever use of the other decays modes of @xmath225 may well allow a measurement of its mass , we believe that this poses an even greater challenge than the measurement of the @xmath5 mass .",

    "that if the error in measuring first generation masses is negligible and mass differences between the various sleptons are small , the error in @xmath70 is given by @xmath232 even neglecting the error in the measurement of @xmath105 , it appears that @xmath233 needs to be determined at about the 2.5% level in order to obtain the required precision on @xmath70 .",
    "unfortunately , in view of the analysis in the previous section this does not seem to be possible , at least using the techniques considered in this study .",
    "even if we change the 90% cl error bar to the `` 1@xmath180 '' error bar ( @xmath234 ) the error on @xmath3 seems to be about 4% .",

    "however , if we allow the neutrino yukawa coupling at the gut scale to be somewhat larger than @xmath235 ( but still require @xmath0 not to blow up before @xmath49 ) then linear collider experiments could be sensitive to the presence of the rhn as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : neut]_b_.    in obtaining this conclusion , we assumed that the only information we would have is on the masses of various sleptons .",

    "<S> in a supersymmetric model , the presence of a right handed neutrino with a large yukawa coupling @xmath0 would affect slepton masses via its contribution to the renormalization group evolution between the grand unification and weak scales . assuming a hierarchichal pattern of neutrino masses , these effects are large for only the third generation of sleptons . </S>",
    "<S> we construct mass combinations to isolate the effect of @xmath0 from mass corrections already expected from tau yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyze the size of these effects , assuming that the super - kamiokande data constrain 0.033  ev @xmath1  ev and that neutrino masses arise via a see - saw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore whether these effects might be detectable in experiments at future @xmath2 linear colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath3 needs to be measured with a precision of about 2 - 3% to measure the effect of @xmath0 if the neutrino and top yukawa couplings unify at the grand unification scale . in a simple case study </S>",
    "<S> , we find a precision of only 6 - 10% might be attainable after several years of operation . if the neutrino yukawa coupling is larger , or in more complicated models of neutrino masses , a determination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 masses might provide a signal of a yukawa interaction of neutrinos . </S>"
