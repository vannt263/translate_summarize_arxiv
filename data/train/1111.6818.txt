    "in this paper we consider simple dynamical models of the cell division cycle . specifically , consider a culture of @xmath0 cells , in which the progression of the @xmath1-th cell is governed by the equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the position of the cell within the cycle and @xmath4 denotes the state of all the cells in the culture .",
    "we will describe the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath3 and @xmath4 below .",
    "our primary motivation for this model is recent theoretical and experimental work on yeast autonomous oscillations ( yao ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the periodic oscillations of physiologically relevant variables that have been reported and studied for over 40 years  @xcite ( and many others ) .",
    "different types of yao have been called metabolic @xcite , glycolytic @xcite or respiratory @xcite oscillations .",
    "the control of oscillation and the regulation of yeast metabolism has been an important theme in the chemical engineering literature devoted to the efficient management of bioprocesses  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are of basic biological interest because they expose questions regarding the coordination of the cell cycle and metabolism , and interconnectedness of various cellular and genetic processes  @xcite . a correlation between yao and the bud index",
    "was noted as early as @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that the link between yao and the cell division cycle ( cdc ) was obscured by the fact that the periods of yao always shorter than the cdc times ( computed from dilution rate ) and a relationship between yao and the cdc seems to have been largely ignored .",
    "however in @xcite , @xcite and elsewhere , the correlation between yao and cdc was again noted in genetic expression data .",
    "region is the later portion of g1 and the signaling region @xmath6 is in the s phase .",
    "that is , a large subpopulation of cells in the replicative s phase may promote or inhibit progression of cells approaching the g1-s boundary . , width=264,height=264 ]    in @xcite and @xcite the authors proposed _ cell cycle clustering _ as a possible explanation of the interaction between yao and the cdc .",
    "figure  [ cycle ] roughly illustrates the arrangement of phases of the cell cycle of yeast .",
    "we hypothesized that subtle feedback effects on cdc progression could cause populations of cells to segregate into approximately cdc - synchronized subpopulations .",
    "experimental bud index data reported in @xcite supported this picture . in @xcite",
    "the authors studied a few simple forms of ( [ ode ] ) with the hypothesis that cells in one part of the cdc may influence other cells in different parts of the cdc in different ways through various diffusible chemical products .",
    "we hypothesized that a large subpopulation of cells in the critical s - phase might effect metabolism production and the metabolites may in turn inhibit or promote cell growth in the later part of the g1 phase , thus setting up a feedback mechanism in which yao and cdc clustering are inextricably intertwined .",
    "we showed analytically and numerically that differential cdc feedback such as this can robustly cause cdc clustering in the models . by clustering we",
    "do not mean spatial clustering ( cultures that exhibit yao occur in well - mixed bioreactors ) , but groups of cells that are traversing the cdc in near synchrony .",
    "percentage ( green ) , bud index percentage ( blue ) and cell density ( red ) are plotted versus elapsed time .",
    "the average cell cycle period as calculated from dilution rate was about 400 minutes .",
    "the plot shows clearly that the bud index ( percentage of cells with buds from microscopy ) and cell density ( by flow cytometry ) are both synchronized with the oscillation in the level of dissolved @xmath7 .",
    ", width=566,height=377 ]    guided by these mathematical results , we verified the existence of clusters in two types of oscillating yeast @xcite using both bud index and cell density data .",
    "some of the measurements from those experiments are shown in figure  [ theplot ] .",
    "first we note that the cell cycle period , as calculated by the dilution rate , is approximately 400 minutes , and two @xmath7 oscillations occur during this period , suggesting that there may be two clusters .",
    "next , analyzing the figure , we see that approximately half of the cells are budding at times @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while at @xmath10 less than 10% of the cells are budded .",
    "each budding event is accompanied by a decrease in density ( no cells are dividing ) and followed by a sharp increase in cell density as these budded cells proceed through division .",
    "note that at @xmath10 since less than 10% of the cells are budded , most of the cells must be in the g1 phase of the cycle .",
    "when the bud index hits its next maximum at @xmath11 , approximately half of the cells must have budded .",
    "the other half of the cells must at that time still be in the g1 phase . as the cells that are budded then divide and the cell density increases , the cells that remained in g1 must still be in g1 since the bud index is again low .",
    "when the first group of cells has divided , the second group has been in g1 for at least 200 minutes .",
    "the next rise in bud index then must be due to these cells , since they have had time to mature , while the first group of recently divided cells clearly has not had time to reach budding again .",
    "thus , these experiments show conclusively the existence of two clusters and that cdc clustering coexists with yao .      in standard modeling the cell volume",
    "@xmath12 is a proxy for position in the cell cycle .",
    "this has justification for yeast in that milestones in the cell cycle , such as the onset of budding , are closely associated with volume milestones and thought to be causally related .",
    "measurements show that the growth of a single cell is roughly exponential , so a first order approximation is that the volume of the @xmath1-th cell satisfies a linear differential equation @xmath13 a frequent assumption on the growth rate @xmath14 is that it does not depend on @xmath15 _ i.e. _  it is independent of the cell s current state within the cycle and on other cells ; it depends instead on the nutrients available and other environmental factors . applying a logarithmic change of variables",
    "the growth law becomes @xmath16 , and by further normalizing both the coordinate @xmath17 and time , the cell cycle can be represented by the unit interval @xmath18 $ ] , and the equation of motion becomes @xmath19 . in this simple model each cell reaches division ( cytokinesis ) at @xmath20 when it returns ( perhaps with its descendant cell ) to @xmath21 and begins the cycle again .",
    "note that a change to normalized coordinates does not depend essentially on the form of ( [ eqn : exp_growth ] ) ; if there is no interaction between cells and cells never stop growing , then one can change variables to the form @xmath19 , with @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "a much more general model ( again using normalized coordinates ) is ( [ ode ] ) .",
    "we proposed to consider forms of ( [ ode ] ) where the cells in one portion of the cell cycle , @xmath6 for _ signaling _ , may influence the growth rate of cells in a preceding portion that we term @xmath23 for _",
    "responsive_. for example the @xmath23 region may reside in the later portion of the g1 phase and the signaling region @xmath6 may be the biological s phase ( see figure  [ cycle ] ) .",
    "this is philosophically justified by the fact that the s phase is the most critical part of the cdc and the link between yao and cdc may function to protect the integrity of transcription @xcite .",
    "it is also known that growing yeast store carbohydrates , then liquidate them in the late g1 phase @xcite .",
    "the actual positions of the signaling and responsive regions within the biological cell cycle play no role in the mathematical analysis . in the rest of the paper we will use @xmath6 to denote the signaling region and on the few occasions when we refer to the yeast s s phase we will do so explicitly .    mathematically , the interval @xmath18 $ ] , with the endpoints identified is a circle . on this circle",
    ", we can specify a positive direction as associated with the increasing direction on @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "distance between points @xmath17 and @xmath24 on the circle using these coordinates is given by the minimum of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "consider @xmath0 cells whose coordinates are given by @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath20 identified with @xmath21 , and governed by an equation of the form ( [ ode ] ) .",
    "when a cell reaches @xmath20 it continues at @xmath21 .",
    "we call such a system a _ rs - feedback system _ if :    1 .",

    "@xmath31 for all @xmath3 and @xmath4 , 4 .",

    "@xmath33 is a smooth function for @xmath34 in the interior or @xmath23 and each @xmath30 in the interior of @xmath6 , @xmath35 and the one sided derivatives exist at the boundaries of @xmath23 and @xmath6 .    by",
    "_ positive feedback _ we mean @xmath5 is positive for @xmath29 if there are one or more @xmath30 in @xmath6 .",
    "we define _ negative feedback _ in the analogous way .",
    "[ defn : rs ]    for the sake of definiteness we will specify throughout the rest of the paper : @xmath36 the final endpoint of @xmath23 is @xmath20 , which corresponds to @xmath21 , the initial endpoint of @xmath6 .",
    "see figure  [ model ] below .",
    "note that our restriction that _",
    "r _ precedes _ s _ , while motivated by biological considerations , is not the only possibility .",
    "it is worth noting that in the reverse case , when _ r _ follows _ s _ , many of our results hold with the roles of positive and negative feedback reversed . in particular , this is true for propositions  [ pos_cluster_isolation ] ,  [ pos_cluster_stability ] ,  [ pos_two_clusters ] ,  [ neg_cluster_stability ] ,  [ neg_two_clusters ] , and corollary  [ neg_periodic_convergence ] .    in  @xcite we considered two idealized forms of ( [ ode ] ) with threshold - triggered feedback and found that with _ either positive or negative linear feedback _ , we robustly observe clustering .",
    "we also observed that the number of clusters formed is less dependent on the form of the feedback than on the sizes of the signaling and responsive regions , @xmath6 and @xmath23 .",
    "one aim of the present paper is to demonstrate that clustering typically occurs in a broad class of models ( [ ode ] ) , beyond the idealized situations investigated in @xcite .",
    "the other aim is to study key differences between positive and negative feedback in the models in order to understand if one or the other is more favorable for clustering and thus more likely to be the process behind experimental observations .",
    "note in definition  [ defn : rs ] that the number of cells in the culture is fixed at @xmath0 .",
    "thus we will consider neither death , harvesting or proliferation . in the oscillation experiments we are modeling there",
    "are in fact proliferation and harvesting ( and an insignificant rate of death ) , but they approximately balance when averaged over a cell cycle .",
    "thus the expected number of cells descended from a single cell at any future cycle is approximately @xmath20 .",
    "further , in the model we are considering , there is no distinction between the two cells resulting from a division and to keep track of both trajectories would be redundant .",
    "the differential equation in the general model ( [ ode ] ) with rs feedback may have discontinuities .",
    "thus we need to consider uniqueness and global existence of solutions .",
    "first consider that the equations may be discontinuous only when a variable is at the boundaries of @xmath23 and @xmath6 _ i.e. _  at the hyper - surfaces given by @xmath37 for some @xmath38 .",
    "we obtain uniqueness since by ( h3 ) any solution crosses a surface of discontinuity non - tangentially with non - zero speed .",
    "global existence follows from boundedness of the vector field ( h3 ) .",
    "a version of the model that we will study in sections 6 and 7 is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 _ i.e. _  @xmath41 is the fraction of cells in the signaling region .",
    "the  response function \" @xmath42 in ( [ eqn : fmodel ] ) must satisfy @xmath43 and be monotone , but can be non - linear , for instance sigmoidal ( s - shaped ) .",
    "we will see that models of this form , while fairly general , can be studied in some detail . in @xcite",
    "we studied some cases where @xmath44 is a linear function .",
    "understanding the cdc at the genetic and biochemical level is a topic of intense interest and progress has been made in identifying the agents and the nature of relationships between them @xcite .",
    "our approach uses a  caricature \" of the cell cycle , rather than detailed modeling , and this simplification demands justification .",
    "first , we wish to deal with individual cells in a population - wide phenomena .",
    "if details within each cell are considered , then the dimensions of the phase space would be extremely large and results would be difficult to obtain .",
    "second , our understanding of the details of the cell cycle and its relations with other processes is not complete and even if the general nature of relationships were well - understood , the resulting set of differential equations would contain many parameters , _",
    "e.g. _  rate constants , that could only be estimated . with our simplified model which is based on biological insight",
    ", we hope to obtain general principles that will inform further detailed investigations .",
    "the approach in part of this work is basically that of  phase oscillator \" models , e.g.  kuramoto equations , in which details of each individual actor are projected onto a simple phase space and emergent population behaviours are studied .",
    "in fact if @xmath42 is linear then our model can be put into the kuramoto form by integrating over the cell cycle for each pair of cells and adding the effects ( see @xcite p. 65",
    "this derivation fails in general for rs models ( [ ode ] ) or ( [ eqn : fmodel ] ) since the effects of cells in general are not additive .",
    "we note here another modeling simplification that we have implicitly made ; namely one might more accurately model the feedback term as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a vector variable representing all substrate factors that contribute to growth rate and @xmath46 itself is coupled with @xmath4 @xcite . dropping the @xmath46 variable",
    "can be justified if the time - scale of the dynamics of this variable is significantly shorter than the time - scale of the cdc .",
    "in this section we begin to study the existence and stability of periodic `` clustered '' solutions for both positive and negative @xmath47-feedback systems ( [ ode ] ) and in later sections we point out crucial differences between these two types of feedback . reducing to the study of clustered solutions",
    "is of practical interest since clusters appear in experiments with yao",
    ". it also limits the dimensions of the problem to a manageable size .",
    "this strategy has proven indispensable in many fields ; for instance in fluid dynamics , insight is obtained by studying finite dimensional vortex equations rather than the full navier - stokes partial differential equations @xcite .    by a _ cluster _",
    ", we will formally mean a group of cells that are completely synchronized in the cdc .",
    "note that rs - feedback systems as defined have the symmetry of globally coupled networks with identical nodes ; namely , the vector field is equivariant with respect to the group of permutations of coordinates .",
    "this symmetry implies that any cells that initially share the same phase keep the same phase as time evolves .",
    "the simplest trajectory consists in taking all cells initially in the same phase .",
    "we have a single cluster @xmath48 ( synchrony ) that generates a periodic solution that runs at velocity 1 around the circle ( _ i.e. _  @xmath49 @xmath50 for every @xmath1 and all @xmath51 ) .    by the _ gap _ between two clusters or cells at @xmath52 and @xmath3 we mean the open interval on the circle from @xmath52 to @xmath3 , in the direction of the flow that contains no cells and has width @xmath53 .",
    "( this can be made precise using a lift to the real line . )",
    "note that if there are only two clusters @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the system , then there are two gaps between them and each gap has a width .",
    "it follows from our assumed coordinates that if two clusters are in @xmath6 and @xmath23 then the distance between them on the circle is less than @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 denotes the length of the interval @xmath58 , which is @xmath59 and @xmath60 denotes the length of the interval @xmath61 . see figure  [ model ] .",
    "we say that a cluster of cells is _ isolated _ if there are gaps between the cluster and any other cells on either side of length at least @xmath62 and _ strictly isolated _ if the widths of gaps are more than @xmath62 .",
    "this terminology is motivated by the fact that strictly isolated clusters can not exert feedback on cells outside the cluster , or have feedback exerted upon them from outside .",
    "while we consider only clustered solutions in the strictest sense , in real cultures individual cell differences will lead to a weaker form of clustering . for clarity we will refer to such a weakly clustered subset of cells as a _ group _ of cells . in figure  [ model ]",

    "that a solution consisting of strictly isolated clusters can be at most neutrally stable ( not asymptotically stable ) since moving a cluster to the left or right still produces an isolated cluster .",

    "if clusters did not clearly form for a given value of @xmath90 , then that data point is plotted on the graph as a zero value for @xmath92 .    , the maximum number of isolated clusters given @xmath23 and @xmath6 .",

    "notice also that positive feedback always produced clustering , but this was not the case for negative feedback . for negative feedback there are parameter values where no clusters form .",
    "finally , it is worthy of note that for negative feedback , there are no occurrences of one - cluster solutions .",
    "analysis in the next sections will shed light on these observations .",
    "besides solutions consisting of @xmath93 isolated clusters , rs - feedback systems have other periodic solutions .",
    "one of these consists of all @xmath0 cells spread along the cycle as uniformly as possible .",
    "we will define a * uniform solution * to be a trajectory for which the coordinates satisfy the following relation for some time @xmath94 : @xmath95 since the velocity of cells in the complement of @xmath23 is precisely @xmath20 , it follows that for such a solution the cells in @xmath96 will be uniformly distributed with inter - cell distance @xmath97 . in the process of the construction of uniform solutions",

    "[ prop : mplus1 ] consider rs feedback of the form ( [ eqn : fmodel ] ) . for any @xmath205 , there is a cyclic solution consisting of @xmath206 equal clusters of the form @xmath207 , for some @xmath94 .",
    "denote @xmath208 . if @xmath209 then the fixed point is unstable for positive @xmath210 and stable for negative @xmath210 . otherwise , the solution is neutrally stable .",
    "both stability results are within the set of @xmath72-cluster solutions .",

    "the proof of proposition  [ prop : mplus1 ] is contained in appendix c.",
    "for both positive and negative feedback , the maximum number of non - interacting clusters , @xmath69 , ( see definition  [ def : m ] ) , plays a large role in the dynamics of the system .",

    "analytic treatment of stability of uniform solutions is a challenge for future work .",
    "perhaps the key observation from the mathematical models is that positive feedback typically leads to synchrony , while negative feedback systems tend to clustering . in practical terms , if a positive feedback mechanism similar to ours were in effect then one would expect to encounter synchronization , at least some of the time . in yeast experiments a single cluster ( fully synchronized behavior )",
    "seems to be impossible to sustain in the laboratory  @xcite and in yao experiments there is clearly no cdc synchrony .",

    "it is natural that these same substances should be considered as signaling agents involved in cdc clustering as well .",
    "we have investigated the role of acetaldehyde and ethanol  @xcite , and have shown that we can reset phase and induce autonomous oscillation with pulses of acetaldehyde .",
    "further , we showed that both acetaldehyde and ethanol injections act differentially in different phases of the cdc and yao and both act as agents of delay , supporting both our model and the role of these substances in processes .",
    "finally , we note that our analysis is quite general and may find applications outside the realm of the yeast .",
    "we note that other micro - organisms can use signaling and coordination of various processes @xcite .",
    "it is well recognized that feedback can produce synchrony in physical and biological systems and this has been extensively studied  @xcite ( and many others ) .",
    "clustering is a far less understood phenomenon . as early as 1977 a model of the cdc",
