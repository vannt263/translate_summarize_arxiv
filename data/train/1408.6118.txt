    "recently , researchers in the field of mathematical finance have increasingly begun studying the optimal execution problem .",
    "bertsimas and lo @xcite and almgren and chriss @xcite are the classic and standard studies in the field , while gatheral and schied @xcite provide a survey of dynamic models that address execution problems .    when studying execution problems , we should take care of the market impact ( mi ) , which is the effect that a trader s investment behavior has on security prices . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the price recovery effect is efficient as another property that affects the trader s execution schedule .",
    "the price recovery effect is also recognized as the resilience of the mi or transient mi , and several studies have proposed optimal execution models with mi functions and resilience functions ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , trading volume ( turnover ) is another important factor in execution problems .",
    "trading volume is a representative index of financial market activity .",
    "if trading volume is high , the security is highly liquid , and a trader can easily liquidate shares of the security . as an execution strategy that exploits trading volume ,",
    "the volume weighted average price ( vwap ) strategy is well known and widely used in practice @xcite .",
    "the execution speed of the vwap strategy is proportional to the trading volume of the relevant security .",
    "although the vwap strategy is a standard execution strategy , it remains unclear why it is effective in terms of optimal execution theory .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate whether the vwap strategy is in fact optimal in an execution problem equipped with explicitly defined trading volume processes . here",
    ", we introduce the generalized almgren ",
    "chriss ( ac ) model , in which the temporary mi function is affected by the trading volume .",
    "then , we show that the vwap strategy is optimal when the trader is risk neutral . moreover , we study the case of a risk - averse trader and deterministic trading volume processes and present the second - order linear ordinal differential equation ( ode ) , in which the solution is the optimal strategy of the corresponding mean - variance optimization problem .",
    "we also provide the first - order asymptotic expansion for the optimal strategy .",
    "finally , we study the mean variance optimization problem when the trading volume process follows the geometric brownian motion .",

    "we assume the following `` sell - off condition '' @xcite : @xmath15 this condition implies that the trader must sell all securities held until the time horizon .",

    "the set of admissible strategies is denoted by @xmath33 . under the given admissible strategy ,",
    "@xmath34 , the security price , @xmath0 , is defined as follows : @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( resp . , @xmath37 )",

    "this assumption is necessary given the view of an absence of price manipulation .",

    "the temporary mi function , @xmath37 , depends on the execution strategy , @xmath40 , and the trading volume , @xmath41 .",

    "we define the following three classes of admissible strategies : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a filtration generated by @xmath6 .",

    "this case is unrealistic , but the optimal anticipating strategy gives us a benchmark for execution strategies .",
    "strategy @xmath55 is called an adaptive strategy .",
    "it is natural to search for an optimal strategy from within the adaptive strategies , but the problem may become difficult",
    ".    strategy @xmath56 is called a static strategy . in trading practice",
    ", a vwap strategy is often classified as a static ( deterministic ) strategy . in this case ,",
    "an estimated cumulative trading volume is used as a substitute for @xmath26 .      in this subsection",

    "the strategy @xmath65 is the vwap strategy .",
    "therefore , theorem [ th_ant ] gives the typical case in which the vwap strategy is optimal for the execution problem .",
    "note again that the `` exact '' vwap strategy , @xmath65 , is not executable without observing the future value of the cumulative trading volume , @xmath26 .",

    "in particular , theorem 7.4 in @xcite gives the example of an `` s - shaped '' mi function , which is often observed in practice .",
