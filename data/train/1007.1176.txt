    "the world of our everyday experience is largely controlled by two dimensionless fundamental quantities : the fine structure constant @xmath6 and the electron - to - proton mass ratio @xmath7 .",
    "the former describes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the two together relate the energy of atomic excitations to the bulk of the atomic mass .",
    "among the myriads of phenomena governed by these two constants , only a handful are suitable for their precise determination .",
    "two characteristics are required : they have to be amenable to measurements and they must be theoretically very well understood .",
    "most of such systems consist of only one , two , or three bodies .    in this",
    "talk we focus on the theoretical aspects of hydrogen - like ions .",
    "measurements of their interaction with the magnetic field are a crucial ingredient in the best determination of @xmath1 , and indirectly help to determine @xmath0 with the second - best accuracy .",
    "we first briefly review the present knowledge of both constants , to illustrate the level of accuracy already achieved .",
    "a system of ultimate simplicity is a single electron .",
    "it is studied with the penning trap where it forms what is sometimes called a geonium atom @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of lowest lying states is sensitive to the electron anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath2 , and thus to @xmath0 through the theoretical expression @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the coefficients determined from an @xmath10-loop correction to the interaction of an electron with a weak homogeneous magnetic field , calculated in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) ; and @xmath11 are small corrections due to weak interactions and hadronic effects .",
    "the qed effects are now being studied at five - loops @xcite .",
    "indeed , the missing information about @xmath12 is the leading error in the present best value of @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath13 the relative uncertainty of this evaluation is 0.37 part per billion ( ppb ) .    the penning trap can also be used to measure @xmath1 by comparing the cyclotron frequency @xmath14 of an electron with that of a proton .",
    "the best value obtained in this way is accurate to 2.2 ppb @xcite , @xmath15 the systematic limitation of this determination is the relativistic shift of the electron mass due to thermal excitations of the magnetron motion of the electron . for this reason , studies of electrons bound in a heavier ion , that will be discussed below ,",
    "are superior : the thermal velocity of such a heavy system is eliminated as the source of relevant errors .    the second - best method for finding @xmath0 is based on the excellent knowledge ( to within 0.007 ppb ) of the rydberg constant @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the planck constant and @xmath18 the velocity of light .",
    "the latter being an exact number , @xmath0 can be determined if the ratio of the electron mass to the planck constant is measured .",
    "such a direct measurement is difficult , but it is possible to measure the ratio of an atom mass @xmath19 to @xmath17 for atoms such as cesium and rubidium @xcite .",
    "then , if @xmath1 and @xmath20 are known , one can determine @xmath0 .",
    "( this underscores again the importance of @xmath1 . )",
    "the best value obtained in this way , with rubidium atoms , is @xmath21 a 4.6 ppb determination .",
    "efforts to reduce this error to about 1 ppb are being undertaken @xcite .",
    "a macroscopic effect that competes with the atomic scale phenomena in the possible accuracy of determining @xmath0 is the quantum hall effect @xcite , giving the value @xmath22 whose uncertainty is 23 ppb .",
    "the last method for @xmath0 that we want to mention here is based on the comparison of the measurement @xcite of the fine structure of helium with qed predictions @xcite , having at present a 31 ppb uncertainty , @xmath23 in addition to the two methods of determining the electron - to - proton mass ratio that were already mentioned , there are also ongoing efforts employing simple molecules .",
    "rotational and vibrational excitations have energies proportional to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath26 denotes the mass of the nuclei .",
    "thus , measurements of rovibrational spectra of systems such as ions @xmath27 and @xmath28 directly access @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this approach depends of course on the accurate theoretical description of the ion .",
    "the current status of experimental and theoretical studies is described in @xcite .",
    "we now focus on one system : an electron bound in a hydrogen - like ion .",
    "we discuss its theoretical description , explain how the ion is used to determine the electron - to - proton mass ratio , and discuss prospects for improvements of the theoretical predictions .",

    "solid and wavy lines denote electrons and photons .",
    "the dotted lines denote the interaction with the nucleus which is described in sec .",
    "[ sec::method ] .",
    "the interaction vertex of the external photon is denoted with the symbol @xmath30 . ]",
    "consider an ion consisting of a nucleus with zero spin and a single electron .",
    "we will be interested here in the ground state of this ion .",
    "since the nucleus has no magnetic moment , the magnetic interaction of this system is very similar to that of a free electron , modulo small binding effects .",
    "we define the bound - electron gyromagnetic ratio @xmath5 by the correction to the energy of the ion , linear in the magnetic field @xmath31 . in the ground state ,",
    "the whole magnetic moment @xmath32 of the ion is due to the electron s spin @xmath33 , so the energy shift is@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electron s charge .",
    "the expectation value is to be calculated with the wave function of the ion .    in the lowest order , neglecting all effects except the coulomb field , @xmath5 was calculated @xcite already in 1928 , in one of the first applications of the dirac equation @xcite . to illustrate the influence of binding effects ,",
    "we reproduce here that result , treating the interaction with the external magnetic field as a perturbation .",
    "a uniform field is described by the vector potential @xmath36 , and the correction to the energy is@xmath37 where @xmath38 is the solution of the dirac equation with the coulomb potential @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the number of protons in the ion s nucleus and @xmath41 describes the position of the electron relative to the nucleus ( we assume the nucleus to be very heavy and motionless ) .",
    "the ground state wave function can be written in the form @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a spinor such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a normalization constant such that @xmath46 @xmath45 approximately equals the value of the non - relativistic coulomb wave function at the origin , @xmath47 . in the standard ( dirac ) representation , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . with this wave function",
    ", we find @xmath50 radial integrals of this type are @xmath51 leading to @xmath52 the result first obtained by breit @xcite .      in view of recent precise measurements with hydrogen - like ions ,",
    "a variety of corrections have recently been studied , including electron self - interaction loops @xcite , vacuum polarization @xcite , and recoil corrections @xcite .",
    "some effects have been determined to all orders in @xmath53 @xcite while for others a few terms of the expansion around small @xmath53 have been calculated .    here",
    "we take the nucleus to be infinitely heavy and neglect small hadronic and weak effects .",
    "the theoretical prediction for @xmath5 in this limit can be organized as a double series expansion in @xmath54 ( describing electron selfinteraction ) and @xmath53 , describing interactions between the electron and the nucleus , i.e. the binding effects .",
    "if we neglect selfinteractions , @xmath5 is given by breit s result ( [ eq : gcoulomb ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we neglect the binding , @xmath5 is the same as for a free electron , @xmath55 , with the anomaly @xmath56 described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : g-2 ] ) .",
    "the interplay of the two types of effects occurs first at the order @xmath57 .",
    "interestingly , at this order in @xmath53 , the correction is universal to all orders in @xmath0 .",
    "it is found by considering the magnetic interaction of a bound particle , taking into account its anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath58 , where @xmath56 is given in ( [ eq : g-2 ] ) .",
    "there are no effects linear or cubic in @xmath53 , but beginning with @xmath59 all higher powers are present .",
    "in fact , in the approximation of a single - photon electron selfinteraction , it is possible to use the exact form of the electron propagator in the coulomb field and numerically determine effects of @xmath60 to all orders @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "it is still very interesting to compute analytically the coefficients of the @xmath53 expansion to check the numerical evaluation .",
    "such a calculation was performed for the terms @xmath62 and @xmath63 only in 2004 @xcite , which illustrates the difficulty of performing even one - loop calculations for bound particles .",
    "the situation becomes even harder when two selfinteraction loops are included . in this case",
    "no numerical all - order study has been performed .",
    "the terms @xmath64 and @xmath65 are already known @xcite .",
    "together with measurements with carbon ions @xcite the resulting theoretical prediction provides the best value of the electron - to - proton mass ratio , @xmath66 where we have used the codata recommended value of the proton mass in atomic units , @xmath67 , which contributes an order of magnitude less to the uncertainty in ( [ eq : ptoe ] ) than the electron .",
    "we see that the error in ( [ eq : ptoe ] ) is four times smaller than in the determination using a free electron , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vandyck ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in ( [ eq : ptoe ] ) is dominated by the experiment ; the theory is estimated to contribute only about three per cent of the total error .",
    "the reliability of the theoretical prediction is based on the numerical knowledge of higher - order binding effects in the one - loop selfinteraction .",
    "it is thus very important to independently check the numerical studies by computing further terms in the @xmath53 expansion . in particular , the coefficient of the contribution @xmath68 to @xmath5 ( for the principal quantum number @xmath69 , that is the ground state ) is estimated to be @xmath70 @xcite , in the notation of @xcite .",
    "the two - loop effect @xmath71 is estimated to have the coefficient between @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite .    in order to verify these predictions ,",
    "we have undertaken an explicit determination of the coefficients of @xmath74 terms at one and two - loop selfinteraction level .",
    "in the next section we present some details of our method with examples of simpler observables , not involving an external magnetic field : the lamb shift in hydrogen - like ions , and the hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) in muonium .",
    "in this section we describe our calculations of the radiative - nonrecoil corrections to the lamb shift  @xcite and the hyperfine splitting  @xcite of hydrogen - like atoms . in both cases",
    "the shift of the energy levels is given by a delta function potential , which affects only @xmath75 states , @xmath76 @xmath77 is the wave function of a bound @xmath75 state with principal quantum number @xmath61 and reduced mass @xmath78 at the origin .",
    "the amplitude @xmath79 is determined from the corresponding feynman diagrams .",

    "the interaction of the electron with the nucleus is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig::delta ] . in our calculation",
    "we construct an expansion in the ratio of electron and nucleus mass , using the method of expansion by regions  @xcite .",
    "we are only interested in the leading term , which is given by the region where all loop momenta are of the order of the electron mass . expanding the nucleus propagators",
    "we find that to leading order the only difference between the diagrams with direct and crossed photon exchange is an overall sign and the sign of the @xmath81 prescription of the latter .",
    "we have @xmath82 where the ellipses stand for higher order terms . @xmath83 and @xmath26 are the momentum and mass of the nucleus with @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the loop momentum . in the rest frame of the nucleus , the factor @xmath86 ensures that the photons exchanged between the electron and the nucleus carry no energy .",
    "the integration over the loop denoted with the dotted line in the feynman diagrams in the figures is only over the spatial components @xmath87 .",
    "our calculation is automated to a large extent .",
    "we use the program qgraf  @xcite to generate all feynman diagrams .",
    "these are turned into form - readable  @xcite expressions by q2e and exp  @xcite .",
    "the program matad3  @xcite is used to perform the traces and express the amplitude @xmath79 in terms of scalar integrals , using custom made routines .",
    "finally , we use integration - by - parts identities  @xcite to express all scalar integrals in terms of 32 so - called master integrals .",
    "this is achieved with the help of the program fire  @xcite , which implements the so - called laporta algorithm  @xcite .",
    "results for all master integrals and details of their calculation are given in ref .",

    "the same set of 32 integrals is sufficient to compute the bound electron @xmath5 factor to the desired accuracy , @xmath91 .",
    "the only remaining obstacles are the larger number of diagrams and the necessity of determining corrections to the wave function of the ion .    as the first step",
    ", we have found the gauge invariant set of one - loop ( vertex ) corrections to the electron interaction with the magnetic field , an ingredient of the coefficient of @xmath92 , providing approximately a quarter of the estimated value of 23.15(10 ) @xcite .",
