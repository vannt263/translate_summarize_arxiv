    "the simplest calculation what one can do is the born level fix order calculation .",

    "the matrix element is basically a complicated expression but it can be generated in a automated way .",
    "several implementations can be found in the literature , alpgen , grace , helac , madgraph and sherpa@xcite .",
    "we can say that the tree level cross sections can predict the shape of the cross sections but in general they have several defects : i ) since it is the leading order term in the strong coupling expansion the result strongly depends on the unphysical renormalization and factorization scheme .",
    "ii ) the exclusive physical quantities suffer on large logarithms . in the phase space regions where these logarithms are dominant the predictions are unreliable .",
    "iii ) in the born level calculations every jet is represented by a single parton , thus we do nt have any information about the jet inner structure .",
    "iv ) on the other hand in a real measurement , in the detector we can see hadrons and every jet consists many of them .",
    "we are not able to consider hadroniziation effects in the born level calculations .",
    "we can increase the precision of our theory ( qcd ) prediction by calculating the next term in the perturbative expansion , the next - to - leading order correction ( nlo ) .",
    "however this is just one order higher to the born cross section but the complexity of the calculations increases enormously .",
    "we have to face to algebraic and analytic complexity .",
    "the naive structure of the nlo calculation is @xmath5 here @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to the born , real and virtual contributions , respectively .",
    "this expression is well defined only in @xmath9 dimension because both the real and virtual terms are singular separately in @xmath10 dimension , but their sum is finite .",
    "thus we can not calculate them separately , first we have to regularize this integral . in the real part",
    "the singularities comes from the phase space integral from the regions where a gluon becomes soft of two partons become collinear and the integral over these degenerated phase space regions leads to contributions those are proportional to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the infrared singularity structure of the virtual contributions is exactly the same but with opposite sign , thus they cancel each other . to achieve this cancellation we have to reorganize our calculation in such a way that can be carried out in @xmath10 dimension @xmath13_{\\epsilon=0 } + \\int_{n}\\big[d\\sigma^v + \\int_1 d\\sigma^a\\big]_{\\epsilon=0}\\;\\;.\\ ] ] here we subtracted the approximated version of real contribution and added it back in different form . in the second term",
    "@xmath14 cancels the singularities of @xmath15 and it is safe to perform the integral in @xmath10 dimension while in the third term the explicit singularities of @xmath16 are cancelled by @xmath17 , where we performed the integral over the unresolved phase space analytically .",
    "it is important that the approximated real contribution has universal structure .",
    "this term is based on the soft and collinear factorization property of the qcd matrix elements .",
    "a general subtraction scheme was defined by catani and seymour @xcite and the extenion of this method for massive fermions is also available @xcite .",
    "the nlo calculation can be carried out but it hasnt been automated like the born level calculations . the most complicated processes what we can calculate are @xmath18 type @xcite . to go beyond this limit we have to find an efficient way to compute the virtual correction .",
    "recently we have had some very promising developement on this area @xcite",
    ".    with the nlo corrections we can significantly reduce the dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales but in some cases it is not enough and the nnlo is also required . in these calculations one of the jet",
    "is represented by two partons .",
    "this can give some minimal information about the inner jet structure but is still very poor .",
    "the exclusive quantities are still suffers on large logarithms and we are still not able to consider hadronization effects .",
    "for some processes and/or jet observables it is important to know the cross sections at next - to - next - toleading order level . in",
    "this cases the nlo @xmath19-factor usually large even larger than @xmath20 which means that the nlo correction does nt reduce the scale dependences .",
    "recently some simple but important processes have been calculated using sector decomposition method @xcite and there are some ongoing developments on defining a general scheme for nnlo calculations @xcite .",
    "the fix order calculations are systematically defined order by order and usually give good description well the data over the phase space where the large @xmath21 event are the dominant . in any order we still have to deal with the presence of the large logarithms and we can not consider hadronization effect .",
    "there is an other way to calculate crass section in the perturbative framework , the parton shower calculations .",
    "consider the parton shower picture of hadron - hadron scattering in which there is some sort of hard event , say jet production .",
    "the parton shower description starts form hard scattering and proceeds forward to the softer scattering . in the final state",
    "the shower proceed forward in real time but for initial state parton the sowers proceeds backward in real time .",

    "the hardest interactions are those toward the center of the picture .",
    "these are treated first in a parton shower monte carlo program .",
    "thus in monte carlo time t , we start with the hard process and work toward softer interactions ( with some of the particles moving backwards in real physical time ) , as depicted in the right hand picture .",

    "the singularity does nt make color connection , it is completely factorized out",
    ". there are some spin correlation in the gluon splitting but this spin correlation is rather trivial . on the other hand one can always use spin averaged splitting functions but this is an additional approximation .",
    "considering only the collinear emission our first `` candidate '' for the splitting kernel would be @xmath32^{*}\\;\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is the color charge operator of the mother parton and @xmath34 is the vertex function .",

    "the momenta of the daughter partons are @xmath36 and @xmath37 . with collinear splitting operator",
    "one can sum up the leading ( double ) logarithmic contributions properly .",
    "the matrix element has universal factorization property in the soft limit , when the energy of a final state gluon becomes zero .",
    "we can not neglect soft gluon contributions since they produce next - to - leading logarithms when we integrate the matrix elements over the phase space .",

    "one can show that the expression under the square brackets vanishes in large angle limit when @xmath40 ( the @xmath41 denotes the angle between momenta @xmath42 and @xmath43 . ) .",
    "this effect is know as _",
    "color coherence_. note , the color coherence breaks down with massive hard partons ( quarks , susy particles ) . in this case",
    "we have wide angle soft radiations .",
    "this is it , we defined a splitting kernel based on the soft and collinear approximation . with this",
    "we are able to sum up the leading and next - to - leading logarithms .",
    "we still have some freedom , for example the definition of splitting kernel away from the limits or the momentum mapping . the evolution ( ordering ) parameter can be basically any infrared sensitive variable such as the virtuality or the transverse momentum of the daughter partons .",
    "note , if we want to consider spin and color correlations properly in the parton shower we _ can not _ avoid negative weights .",
    "so far there is only one algorithm has been defined along this ideas @xcite but it hasnt been implemented yet . from the point of the implementation ,",
    "the color interferences make some complications but one can impose some further approximations to simplify it .",
    "herwing@xcite and old pythia@xcite implement direct angular ordering@xcite . inserting the conditions for the emission angles into eq",
    ".   then we have @xmath44 where the dots stand for the neglected terms those are finite in both soft and collinear limits .",
    "note , these contributions are finite only after we perform the integral over the azimuthal angle of @xmath37 about the direction @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if we consider only those phase space regions where emissions are ordered in angle then @xmath47 and the color part of eq .   becomes trivial and the approximated splitting kernel is identical to the collinear splitting kernel which is given in eq .  .",
    "the other way to simplify the color structure is to expand the splitting kernel in powers of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of the color states in fundamental representation .",
    "the gluon is a color @xmath50 , but in leading color approximation the gluon can be considered to be a @xmath51 .",
    "the partons makes @xmath52 color dipoles with other partons but at leading color level the gluon never makes a color dipole with itself .",
    "the color connection operator @xmath53 becomes simple , it is non - zero if the partons @xmath35 and @xmath54 makes a @xmath52 color dipole and the approximated splitting operator is identical to the collinear splitting kernel given in eq .  .",
    "in this approximation it is important that the momentum mapping must be exact or based on dipole kinematics ; if parton @xmath35 radiates a gluon then the recoiled parton must be the color connected one .",
    "ariadne@xcite and the new pythia@xcite implement this approximation .",
    "there are some new developments @xcite based on the leading color approximation and they implement this color dipole shower model .",
    "the parton shower algorithms have been derived from perturbative qcd but we can not consider them as theory predictions because they use rather nonsystematic approximations .",
    "the original idea was to consider and simulate higher order matrix element by using only soft and collinear factorization of the qcd matrix elements .",
    "this is a systematical approximation since the factorization properties of the matrix elements are held all order . at the end of this section",
    "it is worthwhile to highlight the addition approximations and the limitation of the available parton shower implementations :    1 .",
    "the current parton shower programs are still leading order calculations however they consider higher order contributions in an approximated way .",
    "dependence on the unphysical scales is still strong .",
    "the phase space is usually treated approximately .",
    "the angular ordered showers do nt cover the phase space properly ( `` dead cone '' ) and some special treatment is required to to fill these regions .",
    "the direct angular ordering or the leading color approximation neglect the color correlations .",
    "the color interferences could be significant in the case of non - global observables @xcite .",
    "usually the spin correlations are also neglected .",
    "herwig considers spin correlations .",
    "they are not defined systematically .",
    "the direct angular ordering is not defined or hard to define at higher order .",
    "even the kinematics of the dipole shower model is inconsistent with the higher order .",
    "we have some freedom to define the splitting kernel and momentum mapping but the core algorithm should independent of the level of the calculation .",
    "the only exact matrix element in the calculations is @xmath55 like . if we want to calculate say @xmath56-jet cross section we should use @xmath57 lo or nlo matrix elements . in the next section",
    "i discuss the matching of shower to exact matrix elements .",
    "more questions on non - perturbative effects : what is underlying event ? how can we model it ? how to consider quantum interferences in hadronization models ?",
    "the standard shower depicted in figure  [ fig : shower2 ] has a deficiency , which is illustrated in figure  [ fig : showercontrib ] .    calculation of a shower starting with a @xmath58 hard cross section ( green rounded rectangle ) .",
    "the shower evolution operator has been iterated twice , so that the first term represents no splitting , the second term has one splitting , the third term has two splittings , and the final term contains contributions with three or more splittings.,width=377 ]    the left - hand picture depicts a term contributing to the standard shower . in this term , there are sudakov factors and @xmath59 parton splitting functions . if we omit the sudakov factors , we have the @xmath59 parton splittings as depicted in the middle picture . these splittings are approximations based on the splitting angles being small or one of the daughter partons having small momentum .",
    "thus the shower splitting probability with two splittings approximates the exact squared matrix element for @xmath60 scattering .",
    "the approximation is good in parts of the final state phase space , but not in all of it .",

    "the other approach was originally proposed by krmer and soper @xcite and they implemented it for @xmath79-jets .",
    "the idea is to include the first step of the shower in the nlo calculation and then start the parton shower from this configuration .",
    "based on this concept some matching algorithm have been proposed but they are havent been implemented @xcite .",
    "in the next i discuss in detail only the mc@nlo approach because only this scheme has been implemented for lhc processes so far .",

    "these computer programs perform calculations of cross sections according to an approximation to the standard model or some of its possible extensions . because of the great success of these programs , it is worthwhile to investigate possible improvements .    in a typical parton shower event generator ,",
    "the physics is modeled as a process in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "some number of partons are produced in a hard interaction .",
    "then each parton has a chance to split into two partons , with the probability to split determined from an approximation to the theory .",
    "parton splitting continues in this probabilistic style until a complete parton shower has developed .",
    "the underlying approximation is the factorization of amplitudes in the soft or collinear limits .",
    "however , further approximations are usually added : i ) the interference between a diagram in which a soft gluon is emitted from one hard parton and a diagram in which the same soft gluon is emitted from another hard parton is treated in an approximate way , with the `` angular ordering '' approximation .",
    "ii ) color is treated in an approximate way , valid when @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of colors .",
    "iii ) parton spin is treated in an approximate way . according to the full quantum amplitudes , when a parton splits , the angular distribution of the daughter partons depends on the mother parton spin and even on the interference between different mother - parton spin states .",
    "this dependence is typically ignored . with the use of these further approximations",
    ", one can get to a formalism in which the shower develops according to classical statistical mechanics with a certain evolution operator .",
    "i think the way to improve the parton showers is to formulate it based on the factorization of amplitudes in the soft or collinear limits in which one does not make the additional approximations enumerated above . for this",
    ", one would have to use quantum statistical mechanics instead of classical statistical mechanics .    on the other hand",
    "the parton shower algorithm should cooperate with exact lo and nlo matrix elements .",
    "currently we have some very promising tools such as ckkw , mlm and mc@nlo matching schemes .",
    "the ckkw and mlm matching procedures patch the `` hole '' between the born level fix order and the shower calculations while the mc@nlo and other nlo matching schemes do the same between the shower and fix order nlo calculations . if we want more precise tools we need more advanced framework .",
    "we need a general lo shower framework that naturally includes the lo and nlo calculation . or phrase it differently , we should reformulate the lo and nlo calculation to make the shower part of them .",
