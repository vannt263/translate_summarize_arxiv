    "many bright x - ray sources have been discovered in nearby galaxies . those with luminosities @xmath2 exceeding 10@xmath4 erg  s@xmath5 , the eddington limit for a black - hole x - ray binary ( bhbs ) with a black - hole ( bh ) mass of @xmath9 , are often referred to as ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while a very small number of them appear as hyperluminous x - ray sources ( hlxs , especially ) with @xmath10 erg  s@xmath5 and are strong candidates for intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs ) with @xmath11@xmath12  @xcite , most ulxs have @xmath13 erg  s@xmath5",
    "the nature of these low - luminosity ulxs is still under strong debate",
    ". they could be imbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , super - eddington low - mass bhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , beamed emission from geometrically thick disks at high accretion rates @xcite or from relativistic jets @xcite , or combination of these effects @xcite .    due to their large distances",
    ", there are no confident dynamical mass measurements for ulxs yet @xcite , unlike galactic bhbs , whose dynamical masses of the bhs are constrained to below 20  @xcite .",
    "the spectral and timing properties of galactic bhbs have been well studied , and they are known to exhibit three characteristic x - ray spectral states : the thermal state has a dominant thermal disk and weak fast variability , typically at luminosities above a few percent of the eddington limit ; the hard state has a dominant hard powerlaw ( pl , with photon index @xmath14 typically within 1.42.1 ) and strong fast variability , generally seen at low luminosities ; and the steep - pl state has a powerful pl with @xmath15 and commonly - occuring quasi - periodic oscillations , often seen at very high luminosities @xcite .",
    "these states also often show correlated radio emission @xcite .",
    "thus studies of ulxs often compare their properties with those of galactic bhbs to infer their possible nature .",
    "two transient ulxs were discovered in m31 recently @xcite .",
    "when they reached luminosities above 10@xmath4 erg  s@xmath5 , their x - ray spectra appeared harder than those from a standard geometrically thin optically thick disk .",
    "this is often seen in low - luminosity ulxs , and one possible explanation is compton up - scattering of disc photons in a wind or photosphere @xcite .",
    "the above similarity led @xcite to conclude that these two transient ulxs in m31 are members of low - luminosity ulxs , though the latter are mostly persistent with small long - term variability @xcite .",
    "however , these two ulxs are also similar to bhbs with stellar - mass bhs in other aspects , such as the outburst profile and the coupled x - ray and radio behavior .",
    "thus @xcite concluded that many low - luminosity ulxs are stellar - mass bhbs .    in @xcite , we classified 4330 sources from the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog @xcite .",
    "in this project , many sources showing interesting behavior but poorly studied in the literature were also discoverd .",
    "we are devoting a series of papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to present the properties of these sources in detail .",
    "here we continue our study and concentrate on a highly variable ulx in the spiral galaxy m94 ( ngc 4736 ) , which shows some evidence of dips , periodic oscillations , and a state transition , and has a possible optical counterpart from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images .",
    "the source , whose 1@xmath16 positional error is 035 per coordinate from the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog , is only 026 away from ( ra=12h50m48.605s , dec=+41d07@xmath1742.35@xmath18 , and the 95% error is 029 ) in the _ chandra _ source catalog ( csc , release 1.1 , * ? ? ?",
    "thus we conclude that they are the same source .",
    "it should also be the off - nuclear source detected in a _",
    "rosat_/pspcb observation in @xcite , because they coincide within 5@xmath18 in position and there are no other bright sources within 20@xmath18 from _ chandra _ observations .",
    "we designate the source as ulx2 hereafter , considering that there is a different ulx ( u30 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is hardly variable and has a flux comparable to the peak value of our source . in section",
    "[ sec : reduction ] , we describe the analysis of x - ray and optical observations . in section  [ sec : res ] , we present the results . in section  [ sec : dis ] , we discuss the nature of the source and the cause of its short - term x - ray variability .",

    "@xcite observations were reduced with ftools 6.12 .",
    "we extracted the source emission from a circular region with the radius for each observation given in table  [ tbl : obslog ] .",
    "the background in the xmm - newton and rosat observations strongly depends on the distance to the nucleus due to the presence of bright sources near the nucleus and the relatively large point spread functions ( psfs ) of these two observatories , and we estimated it using four circular regions with the same radius and the same distance to the nucleus as the source region .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "observations have no such problem thanks to their supreme angular resolutions , and we used a single circular region of 10@xmath18 radius near the source to estimate the background .",
    "we extracted both the source and background spectra / light curves from the source and background regions , respectively .",
    "the response files were constructed for the spectral fitting .",
    "we note that we took special care to construct the response file for the _ rosat_/pspcb observation r1 .",
    "the problem is that we used a small source extraction region ( a radius of 20@xmath18 ) in order to minimize the contamination from bright sources near the nucleus , leading to significant psf loss , which is energy dependent .",
    "the response file ( we used the default on - axis version in the heasarc archive ) does not take into account the psf loss , and there is no ftools tool to correct for this .",
    "we estimate the psf loss using the rosat observation rp700130n00 of mkn 501 ( it used the same gain epoch and has a similar ( low ) column density and photon index ( @xmath12.6 ) as our source ) , and correct the count rate in each channel of the spectrum of our source .",
    "such a correction is probably very approximate .",
    "thus the spectral fits to this spectrum might be subject to some systematic error due to this and will be mostly used to infer the luminosity .",
    "we rebinned the spectra to have at least 20 counts in each bin so as to adopt the @xmath24 statistic for spectral fits .",
    "all spectral models used include the absorption described by the wabs model in xspec , with the lower limit of @xmath25 set to be the galactic line - of - sight value of 10@xmath26 @xmath27 @xcite .    to help to identify the optical counterpart ( section  [ sec : hstdata ] ) , we used x - ray sources within 2@xmath17 from the nucleus to improve the relative astrometry between _ chandra _ and _ hst_. to have good relative positions for these x - ray sources , we carried out the source detection using the ciao task ` wavdetect ` @xcite .",
    "we used only the _ chandra _ observation c1 so that all sources of interest are in a single ccd , which is not the case for observation c2 .",
    "we performed the detection on the 0.38 kev image , which was binned at a subpixel resolution ( 1@xmath288 sky pixel ) to improve the source positions .",
    "the sky region around ulx2 was observed by the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard the _ hst _ several times ( table  [ tbl : hst ] ) .",
    "we aligned their drizzled images by matching the point sources to those in the f555w image , resulting in the rms deviations @xmath290.04@xmath18 in all cases . to map the x - ray positions onto the _ hst _ images",
    ", we assumed that in the csc and the uv source at the center of the _ hst _ images are the nuclear source and coincident with each other in position ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "because the nuclear uv source is stronger and less subject to stellar contamination at shorter wavelength and thus appears more clear in the f336w image than in the other images , we used the f336w image to determine its position with the astrolib idl procedure ` cntrd ` .",
    "we found that it happens to be only 002 away from the position of determined by us ( section  [ sec : redxrayobs ] ) . after correcting for this small relative astrometry",
    ", we found an optical point source that is only 0@xmath301 away from ulx2 and was detected in all filters ( figure  [ fig : hstimg ] ) .",
    "we also found three other x - ray sources with optical counterpart candidates within 0@xmath301 , supporting our astrometry correction .",

    "[ fig : srcltlc],scaledwidth=48.0% ]          table  [ tbl : obslog ] lists the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) of ulx2 in each observation .",
    "the source was significantly detected in observations x3 , c1 , c2 , and r1 ( s / n@xmath3117 ) , but it was only marginally detected in observations x1 and x2 ( s / n@xmath325 ) and was not detected in observations r2 and r3 ( s / n@xmath331 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : srcltlc ] plots the long - term 0.210 kev absorbed luminosity curve of ulx2 .",
    "the spectral models that we assumed to derive the luminosities are those shown in figure  [ fig : indlcsp ] for the bright observations ( x3 , c1 , c2 and r1 ) and a pl for the other faint observations , which will be described in section  [ sec : spmod ] .",
    "the luminosity reached @xmath34 erg  s@xmath5 in observation x3 , supporting ulx2 as a low - luminosity ulx .",
    "this luminosity is a factor of @xmath1100 of that of observation x1 ( we did not use observations r2 and r3 for comparison because their luminosities have larger uncertainties ) . considering that observations r2 and r3 are close in time and that x1 and x2 are close in time too ,",
    "ulx2 was observed in essentially six epochs and detected in four ( or in five if the detections in x1 and x2 are really from ulx2 ) of them over nearly two decades .",
    "thus the source has a large duty cycle ( @xmath170% or more ) and is probably a highly variable persistent source or a recurrent transient with probably at least three outbursts in the last two decades ( see figure  [ fig : srcltlc ] ) .",
    "considering that observations x3 and c2 are about one year apart , the outburst should last more than one year if they are in the same outburst .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ fig : indlcsp ] show the light curves of the four observations when ulx2 was significantly detected , in order of decreasing luminosity from the top to the bottom panels .",
    "the brightest observation x3 seems to experience dipping behavior sporadically ( 15 ks and 25 ks into the observation ) , with duration a few hundred seconds . to understand the spectral properties in the dipping periods",
    ", we extracted the spectrum in the dipping period when the pn 1 - 10 kev count rate is @xmath290.06 counts  s@xmath5 ( refer to figure  [ fig : indlcsp ] ) .",
    "the spectrum turns out to be soft .",
    "when we fitted it with a multi - color disk ( mcd , diskbb in xspec ) , we obtained the inner disk temperature @xmath35 kev ( the column density is @xmath36 @xmath27 , and the reduced @xmath24 is relatively high ( 2.0 ) for 6 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) ) . in comparison ,",
    "the total spectrum gives @xmath37 kev ( section  [ sec : spmod ] ) .",
    "the hardness ratio , defined as the pn count rate in 110 kev divided by that in 0.2 - 1 kev , is 0.31@xmath200.06 in the above dipping period , significantly lower than that ( 1.05@xmath200.02 ) from the whole observation .",
    "we also calculated the ratio of the pn count rate in the dipping period to that from the whole observation and obtained @xmath38 using 0.21 kev events and @xmath39 using 12 kev events .",
    "thus the dips are accompanied by spectral softening .",
    "because of this , we created the light curve using a high - energy band ( 110 kev ) for this bright observation to show the dips more clearly .",
    "dips might also be present in the two fainter observations r1 and c2 , but not clearly seen due to low counting statistics .",
    "in contrast , the light curve of the fainter observation c1 might show three flares that could possibly indicate @xmath17-hr ( quasi-)periodic modulations over two cycles . using a 60 ks window to calculate the count rates at different times",
    ", we found that the count rates in the three flares are about 3.3 , 5.0 and 6.8 times of those in the minima ( the count rates in the two minima are similar ) , corresponding to about @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we also extracted the spectra in the bright and faint intervals , depending on whether the count rate is larger or smaller than 0.005 counts  s@xmath5 .",
    "when we fitted them with a pl , we obtained their photon indices to be @xmath43=2.5@xmath200.2 and 2.6@xmath200.4 , respectively ( we fixed @xmath25 at @xmath44 @xmath27 obtained from the fit to the total spectrum ( section  [ sec : spmod ] ) because of the low counting statistics of the spectra )",
    ". we also calculated the hardness ratio , defined as the count rate in 18 kev divided by that in 0.31 kev and obtained the values of 0.71@xmath200.11 and 0.76@xmath200.23 for the bright and faint intervals , respectively .",

    "the excess is much larger , by 1.5 and 0.7 mag compared with the fits with a g8i star and a k3v star , respectively , though in this filter the source was detected only at 6@xmath16 .",
    "the apparent visual magnitude of our source is @xmath126=22.22 , corresponding to an absolute magnitude of @xmath127 at the distance of m94 , which is close to that expected for a g8i star or that for a red globular cluster containing @xmath1@xmath128 k3v stars . in the above",
    ", we have neglected the possible effect of binary evolution on the color of the donor star .",
    "ulx2 was fortunately captured at different flux levels , showing clear spectral evolution . with similar spectral models tested",
    ", we can easily compare ulx2 with the second ulx in m31 ( ) studied by @xcite .",
    "the brightest observation x3 of ulx2 is very similar to the brightest _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations xmm3 and xmm4 of .",
    "all these observations have @xmath129 erg  s@xmath5 and are better fitted by the mcd+comptt model than by a pl , a mcd , or their combination .",
    "the fits with the mcd+comptt model to these observations all inferred a relatively cool ( @xmath291 kev , which was not well constrained ) disk and comptonization in a cool ( @xmath11 kev ) optically thick ( @xmath130 ) corona .",
    "is probably a stellar - mass bhb with @xmath9 , based on the joint radio / x - ray behavior and the observation of a disk - dominated state at a very low luminosity , supporting that the above spectra are probably characteristic of accretion at the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "then ulx2 could be a stellar - mass bhb as well , with an accretion rate around the eddington limit in observation x3 .",
    "many low - luminosity ulxs show similar spectra and could also be explained as supercritically accreting stellar - mass bhbs @xcite .",
    "if ulx2 is really a stellar - mass bhb , we would expect it to behave similar to typical galactic bhbs when it is at well sub - eddington luminosities . in the fainter observation c2 ( @xmath131 erg  s@xmath5 ) ,",
    "the spectrum is softer than observation x3 and can be described with a standard thermal accretion disk , thus consistent with being in the thermal state of galactic bhbs .",
    "the thermal state in galactic bhbs tends to occur above @xmath132 of the eddington limit @xcite . assuming observation c2 to be in this state and using its 0.210 kev unabsorbed luminosity from the mcd model , we constrained the mass of the bh in ulx2 to be @xmath124100 , supporting the identification as a stellar - mass bhb .",
    "we note that for this observation we can not rule out a steep pl model with relatively strong absorption from the fit . in the even fainter observation c1 ( @xmath133 erg  s@xmath5 )",
    ", the spectrum becomes harder again and can be described with a pl with @xmath134 .",
    "such a photon index is often seen in the steep - pl state of galactic bhbs , and the source might be in such a state in this observation , but considering its large uncertainty , we can not rule out the source being in the hard state instead . in any case , we might have observed a state transition often seen in bhbs .",
    "we clearly need higher quality data for more detailed comparison .",
    "therefore transient / highly variable ulxs like ulx2 and serve a link between persistent low - luminosity ulxs and classical stellar - mass bhbs .",
    "this is reminiscent of the first known transient z source linking z and atoll sources , the two main classes of weakly magnetized ns lmxbs @xcite .",
    "here we briefly discuss the ns lmxb case to gain some insights into the physics involved in the bhb case .",
    "z sources reach the eddington limit or above and are mostly persistent with variability factors of only a few , while atolls have luminosities typically less than 50% of the eddington limit and tend to be transient or highly variable .",
    "the proof that z sources accrete at near or super - eddington limit and is the same class of object as atolls but at different accretion rates based on is very convincing in several ways @xcite .",
    "first , z and atoll sources have well - known distinct timing and spectral properties , and showed z - source properties at high luminosities and then atoll - source ones during the decay in its 2006 - 2007 outburst .",
    "secondly , ns lmxbs have a unique way to infer the eddington luminosity , i.e. radius expansion type-1 x - ray bursts , which were detected in , and the luminosities when behaved as a z source were indeed near or above the eddington luminosity inferred from the bursts @xcite . finally , the spectral fitting by @xcite also gathered some evidence that the eddington limit was reached in the z - source stage , especially the result that the disk in the z - source lower vertex had a relatively constant temperature and an increasing inner disk radius with increasing luminosity , deviating from the @xmath135 trend observed in the atoll - source stage .",
    "the increase in the inner disk radius with luminosity is expected because as the mass accretion rate into the disk increases , more and more inner part of the disk reaches the local eddington limit , leading to increasing radial advection flow and/or mass outflow @xcite",
    ".    therefore studies of ns lmxbs not only demonstrate that near or super - eddington accretion is possible but also assure us that objects with different outbursting behaviors and luminosities can belong to the same class and have overall spectral / timing properties mainly determined by the accretion rate .",
    "all this supports the possibility that most low - luminosity ulxs are in fact near or super - eddington accreting stellar - mass bhbs .",
    "galactic bhbs are known to show many similarities to atolls , such as sub - eddington luminosity , transient behavior , broad - band noise , and possibly also disk spectral evolution @xcite , though there are also some differences , such as hotter thermal spectra and stronger millisecond variability in atolls , which could be reasonably ascribed to emission from the impact of materials onto the ns surface .",
    "then there is a question of whether ulxs that are supercritically accreting stellar - mass bhbs also show some properties observed in z sources .",
    "one possible interesting similarity is their generally small long - term variability .",
    "classical z sources ( , , , , , and ) , all with a low - mass companion , are persistent with long - term variation factors of only a few ( only two z sources ( and ) , discovered recently , are transients ) .",
    "most known ulxs are also persistent .",
    "@xcite found only 15 with a long - term variation factor @xmath13610 in their 100 ulxs , which is in contrast with the general transient behavior of galactic bhbs , especially those with a low - mass companion .",
    "this could be because most of these ulxs might have a high - mass companion , but from z sources we can not rule out that the long - time activity might be related to high accretion rates .",
    "it would also be worthwhile to search for similarity of the disk behavior between ulxs and z sources .",
    "@xcite had reported similar disk evolution in the bhb in a very bright state , i.e. , the @xmath111 state , to that seen in in the z - source stage .",
    "a lot of work is still needed in the future to establish the possible connection between z sources and low - luminosity ulxs .",
    "the observations of dips from ulx2 make it one of the dipping sources , which include about 20 galactic x - ray binaries and a few ulxs , such as the ulx in ngc 55 @xcite and ngc 5408 x-1 @xcite .",
    "long dips lasting for 10%30% of the orbital phase are mostly found in ns lmxbs and can be explained as due to absorption by a bulge on the edge of the accretion disk at the point where the gas stream impacts the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "short dips less than a few hundred seconds ( thus typically @xmath291% of the orbital period ) are commonly observed in two bhbs ( with a low - mass companion ) and ( with a supergiant companion ) .",
    "they show orbital phase dependence and could be due to absorption in accretion streams from the companion @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether the dipping ulxs in ngc 55 and ngc 5408 also show orbital phase dependence , but they might have similar origin .",
    "dips in ulx2 are short and are thus probably also due to absorption in accretion streams .",
    "the spectrum becomes soft in the dips in observation x3 , which could be because a hot component is obscured and/or because the absorbing matter is partially ionized . in terms of the mcd+nthcomp model that we used to fit observation x3 ,",
    "the dipping spectrum that we created from this observation could be very roughly accounted for with either complete obscuration of the nthcomp component ( the reduced @xmath24 is 3.7 for 7 d.o.f . ) or with the presence of absorbing matter with a column density of @xmath137 @xmath27 and ionization parameter of @xmath138 ( the reduced @xmath24 is 4.3 for 7 d.o.f . , using the ionized absorption model zxipcf in xspec ) .",
    "we do not have enough dips to search for periodicity , which could otherwise provide information of the orbital period . in any case , the dips often imply that the system is at a high inclination .",
    "detection of ulxs at high inclinations is important , because it poses a problem to use the beaming effect to explain the ultraluminous nature of these sources .",
    "the possible large ( quasi-)periodic x - ray modulations / flares in observation c1 is also a special property of ulx2 .",
    "similar modulations were also observed in some ulxs such as in circinus ( @xmath17.5",
    "hr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( @xmath12 hr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in m74 ( @xmath12 hr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main difference is that ulx2 has @xmath139 erg  s@xmath5 while those sources have @xmath140 erg s@xmath5 when such large modulations were observed .",
    "various explanations for such modulations were discussed by those studies , including the binary eclipse , modulations of the accretion rate due to some instability , and variability at the base of the jet . because ulx2 might have a high inclination considering the detection of dips",
    ", if the flares are periodic , the binary eclipsing explanation seems plausible , with the @xmath17-hr period being the orbital period .",
    "the main problem for this explanation is that we found no spectral change accompanying the flux variation .",
    "moreover , such modulations seem to be flux and/or spectral state dependent because they were not seen in the brighter / softer observations . therefore the disk or jet instability explanations are favored .",
    "another interesting aspect of ulx2 is our identification of its point - like red optical counterpart candidate .",
    "some ulxs have been reported to have optical counterpart candidates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) .",
    "most of them appear blue and are probably contaminated by accretion activity , while some have a clear red component like our source , such as @xcite and @xcite . for , there is also an extra blue component which was shown by @xcite to be probably from disk emission , while the red component could be an asymptotic giant branch star .",
    "there is some possible uv excess in ulx2 , and the most likely explanation is the disk emission too .",
    "we note that our source is highly variable while the _ hst _ observations are not simultaneous with each other or with x - ray observations .",
    "therefore , one explanation for why the counterpart to ulx2 appears red while those to other ulxs are mostly blue is that the _ hst _ observations of ulx2 were made when it was not x - ray ultraluminous , though the alternative explanation that ulx2 resides in an old cluster is also possible .",
    "we have shown many intriguing properties of ulx2 . it is either a highly variable persistent source or a recurrent transient , with a long - term variation factor of at least @xmath1100 and a duty cycle of at least @xmath170% . in the brightest observation x3 , the source exhibited as a member of low - luminosity ulxs , with @xmath141 erg  s@xmath5 and had a spectrum showing a high - energy cutoff but too hard to be described by thermal emission from a standard accretion disk .",
    "short dips , accompanied by spectral softening , are also clearly seen . in the fainter observation c2 ( @xmath142 erg  s@xmath5 ) ,",
    "the spectrum became softer and is consistent with thermal emission from a standard accretion disk with @xmath143 kev , supporting it as in the thermal state as seen in galactic bhbs . in the even fainter observation c1 ( @xmath144 erg  s@xmath5 ) , the spectrum becomes harder again , with @xmath145 , and could be in the steep - pl state or the hard state of galactic bhbs . in this observation",
    ", we also observe possible flares that might indicate @xmath17-hr periodic x - ray modulations .",
    "we also identify a possible point - like optical counterpart , whose colors and luminosity resemble a g8 supergiant or a compact red globular cluster containing @xmath8 k dwarfs except for some possible uv excess . combining all the above properties , we suggest that ulx2 is a stellar - mass bhb with a supergiant companion or with a dwarf companion residing in a globular cluster .",
    "the high variability and large duty cycle of ulx2 makes it easy for multiwavelength follow - up , which is important for confirmation of some properties that we report here , such as the state transition and possible periodic behavior at low luminosities , and reveal more properties to further constrain its nature .            , m.  w. , pivovaroff , m. , baganoff , f. , et  al .",
