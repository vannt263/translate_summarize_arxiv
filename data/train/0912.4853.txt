    "the gurevich - pitaevskii ( gp ) special universal solution of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation @xmath0 was introduced in @xcite in connection with the problem of description of collisionless shock waves ( sagdeev showed in @xcite that such waves are of oscillating character ) .",
    "the behaviour of the gp special solution for @xmath1 and @xmath2 is determined in the main from the cubic canonical equation of the cusp catastrophe @xmath3    the gp solution to the kdv equation is one of the most interesting special functions of the modern nonlinear mathematical physics .    in @xcite it is shown that in problems of dispersion hydrodynamics ( in particular , in problems of plasma theory ) the gp special solution appears near the points of overturning of simple waves . from the results of @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite one actually sees that the same universal special function appears near the points of overturning of the generic state solutions to diverse dispersion perturbations of the equations of one - dimensional motion of ideal incompressible liquid @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the density of the liquid , @xmath6 the velocity and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the speed of sound and @xmath9 the pressure . in particular , this is the case for solutions of the shallow water equations @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the free boundary , @xmath12 the potential of bottom velocity and @xmath13 the acceleration of gravity .",
    "the right - hand sides can actually be written as complete series in powers of the parameter @xmath14 by the procedure given for instance in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  1 ,  4 ) ( and not only as the so - called second approximations , as stated in @xcite ) .    in the 1990s",
    "there were discovered surprising connections of the gp special solutions with some problems of quantum gravity . in @xcite",
    "this solution was showed to simultaneously satisfy the fourth order ordinary differential equation @xmath15 which had been studied for @xmath16 in @xcite and @xcite in connection with evaluating nonperturbative string effects in two - dimensional quantum gravity ( the equation ( [ eq.ode ] ) belongs to a class of massive string equations ) . in @xcite the solution of @xmath17 with asymptotics @xmath18{x}$ ] as @xmath19 was treated numerically in connection with problems of quantum gravity .",
    "one can show that this solution @xmath20 is also equivalent to the gp special solution of ( [ eq.kdv ] ) for @xmath21 ( but not for @xmath22 ) .",
    "dubrovin showed in @xcite and @xcite directly by means of the theory of approximate symmetries @xcite that it is the solution of ( [ eq.ode ] ) with asymptotics ( [ eq.assembly ] ) that appears near the points of wave overturning for the very diverse singular dispersion perturbations of the equations of one - dimensional hydrodynamics .",
    "the results of numerical simulations presented in @xcite demonstrate rather strikingly that the gp special solution of the kdv equation possesses a domain of undamped oscillations for @xmath23 large enough .",
    "the authors of @xcite did not conjecture any relation of their paper to the gp special solution and raised the problem of describing this domain of oscillations .",
    "meanwhile gurevich and pitaevskii @xcite had used successfully the self - similar solutions of the averaged whitham equations @xcite to solve the problem .",
    "the self - similar solutions in question were constructed in explicit form by potemin @xcite .",
    "however , the problem on the leading term of asymptotics of the gp special solution in the domain of whitham oscillations has been open up to now .",
    "one not simple question still unanswered has been that on the phase shift .    our purpose is to show how it is possible to construct the leading term of the gp special solution in the zone of oscillations without using any averaging methods . to this end",
    "we derive certain algebraic equations for the slowly varying amplitude and the leading term of the phase , which are actually equivalent to those of @xcite .",
    "moreover , we determine the phase shift of the solution in the oscillation zone .",
    "our approach may also be of use for the study of undamped oscillations of other common solutions to integrable partial and ordinary differential equations which are of importance in physics .",
    "in particular , it applies to two universal solutions of the kdv equation treated in the recent article @xcite .",
    "almost one problem in the approach is some awkwardness of analytical calculations .",
    "however , invoking modern programs for symbol calculations ( in this paper we use maple ) often allows one to get rid of such problems without particular difficulties .",
    "consider the solution of the kdv equation that , for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , is determined in the main from the cubic equation ( [ eq.assembly ] ) .",
    "it is known that for this solution for positive @xmath23 there is a domain where dissipationless shock waves appear .",
    "we are aimed at constructing asymptotics of the solution in this domain , when @xmath26 . following familiar techniques",
    ", we change the variables by @xmath27 then equations ( [ eq.kdv ] ) and ( [ eq.ode ] ) take the form @xmath28    we now look for a solution @xmath29 of the system in the form of asymptotic series @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath34-periodic in the fast variable @xmath35 .",
    "this latter is assumed to be of the form @xmath36 where by @xmath37 is meant precisely the phase shift .    for the unknown function",
    "@xmath31 we get the nonlinear system @xmath38 while the systems for @xmath32 @xmath39 and for @xmath33 @xmath40 proves to be linear . here ,",

    "we write @xmath46 for short .    from the compatibility condition of the equations for @xmath31 we obtain a first order equation @xmath47 from the compatibility condition of the equations for @xmath32 we derive a nonlinear equation @xmath48 for the unknown function @xmath49 .",
    "( in section [ s.roetsf ] we show that this equation agrees with results obtained earlier . )",
    "when requiring the compatibility of the equations for @xmath33 , we deduce that the function @xmath50 should satisfy , together with ( [ eq.u0 ] ) , a nonlinear ordinary differential equation in the variable @xmath43 of the form @xmath51 here , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are polynomials in @xmath31 of degrees @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , with coefficients depending on @xmath43 and @xmath56 .",
    "the function @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59    note that ( [ eq.u2 ] ) is a hamiltonian equation with hamiltonian quadratic relative to the impulse , i.e. @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are functions of @xmath43 and @xmath31 .",
    "we proceed to study equations ( [ eq.u0])-([eq.u2 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq.u0 ] ) is autonomous in the fast variable @xmath35 , hence the arbitrary constant of the general solution is contained in the phase shift which we take into account in the variable @xmath37 .",
    "the general solution of this equation is sought in the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the elliptic function of jacobi and @xmath12 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are to be defined .",
    "on substituting @xmath31 into equation ( [ eq.u0 ] ) and equating the coefficients of different powers of the jacobi function to zero we get the system of algebraic equations @xmath69 from the assumption on the @xmath34-periodicity of @xmath31 it follows that @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the complete elliptic integral of first kind",
    ".    the system of equations ( [ eq.q , r ] ) , ( [ eq.u1 ] ) , ( [ eq.algebraic ] ) and ( [ eq.periodicity ] ) obtained in this way is overdetermined .",
    "it consists of 6 algebraic equations and 2 differential equations for the unknowns @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath56 , @xmath12 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "our next concern will be to show that one can find all slowly varying unknowns without solving the differential equations .",
    "the unknowns @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath56 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be determined immediately from this system through @xmath12 , @xmath68 and @xmath43 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath74 on substituting these expressions into ( [ eq.algebraic ] ) we arrive at one algebraic equation @xmath75 for @xmath12 and @xmath68 . differentiating this equality in @xmath43 and substituting the resulting expression along with ( [ eq.f , q , r , b , c ] ) into ( [ eq.q , r ] ) and ( [ eq.u1 ] ) , we obtain 3 equations containing @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "on eliminating these derivatives , we get another algebraic equation for @xmath12 and @xmath68 which contains the quotient of two complete elliptic integrals @xmath78 using ( [ eq.a , k ] ) to eliminate the highest power of @xmath43 from the latter equation we bring it to the form @xmath79 when eliminating the variable @xmath12 from ( [ eq.a , k ] ) and ( [ eq.k , a ] ) , one finds @xmath68 as an implicit function of @xmath43 .",
    "the other functions can be expressed explicitly through @xmath68 .",
    "this method allows one to get the explicit formulas of @xcite without using averaging procedure .",
    "the domain of @xmath43 in which oscillations are possible is determined from the condition that @xmath80 $ ] . to the point @xmath81 there corresponds leading wave front set @xmath82 and to the point @xmath83 there corresponds trailing wave front set @xmath84 .",
    "the second ordinary differential equation of ( [ eq.fcov ] ) enables us also to determine the phase shift @xmath37 of the solution . for this purpose",
    "we make use of equation ( [ eq.u2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath31 is an even function of @xmath35 , hence @xmath85 is odd and @xmath86 , @xmath87 are even in @xmath35 . multiplying ( [ eq.u2 ] ) by @xmath88 , integrating in @xmath35 over the whole period @xmath89 and taking into account that the mean value of an odd periodic function over the whole period vanishes",
    ", we get the equation @xmath90    in order to choose a concrete solution to ( [ eq.shift ] ) , one has to use the asymptotics of the solution for @xmath91 .",
    "such an asymptotics is given in @xcite and it shows in particular that the solution does not contain @xmath92 . in our case",
    "we get @xmath93    from the asymptotics of @xmath94 it follows that a solution of ( [ eq.shift ] ) contains terms of the form @xmath95 which are not permitted by @xcite .",
    "hence , this solution enters into the linear combination of solutions with coefficient @xmath96 , and so @xmath97 is constant .",
    "the hypothesis on the constancy of the phase shift @xmath37 has been formulated in @xcite . however , in @xcite it was based solely on the asymptotics given there .",
    "it is clear that _ a priori _ one might not exclude the situation where the phase shift fails to be constant but tends exponentially fast to a constant as @xmath91 . from ( [ eq.shift ] ) and the asymptotics of @xmath98 for @xmath91 we see that such is not the case , and so @xmath37 proves to be constant .    to evaluate the constant @xmath99 we invoke a numerical simulation .",
    "namely , we compare a numerical solution with the solution constructed by using asymptotic formulas .",

    "we have written a special program .",
    "the results of numerical simulations are presented in figures [ f.0 ]  [ f.2 ] .    in figures",
    "[ f.0]-[f.1 ] one can observe numerical solutions for function @xmath103 for negative and positive value @xmath23 .",
    "it can be shown that function @xmath103 for negative value @xmath23 practically councide with the root of the equation @xmath104 .    in figure  [ f.2 ]",
    "the difference between these solutions is shown .",
    "both figures correspond to @xmath101 .",
    "the constant @xmath99 has proved to be equal to @xmath105 .",
    "the difference between two solutions is a multiple of @xmath106 which agrees with the order of the first correction in formula ( [ eq.asymptotic ] ) .",
    "we believe that the constant @xmath99 just amounts to @xmath107 and the small difference is caused by a computation error .",
    "figure  [ f.2 ] makes it evident that the error increases for @xmath43 close to @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this manifests the nonuniform character of the constructed asymptotic formula in the entire domain of the variable @xmath43 . in neighbourhoods of",
    "the leading and trailing wave front sets one should construct other asymptotic formulas which can be made consistent with asymptotic expansion ( [ eq.asymptotic ] ) , as it is described in @xcite .",
    "to start with , we bring the equations obtained in @xcite to a simpler form .",
    "these are @xmath110 for @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "obviously , one can eliminate two variables from three equations .",
    "on eliminating @xmath43 and @xmath115 we get an equation for @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which does not contain @xmath43 and @xmath115 .",
    "namely , @xmath119    we now eliminate either of the variables @xmath43 and @xmath115 in the equations and use ( [ eq.first ] ) to eliminate all powers of @xmath116 greater than the first one .",
    "then we get two more equations @xmath120    the system of equations ( [ eq.q , r ] ) , ( [ eq.algebraic ] ) and ( [ eq.periodicity ] ) is equivalent to the system of averaged equations ( [ eq.first ] ) and ( [ eq.second ] ) which was obtained in @xcite by whitham s method . to prove this",
    ", we pass in the system of the equation for @xmath67 in ( [ eq.f , q , r , b , c ] ) and equations ( [ eq.a , k ] ) , ( [ eq.k , a ] ) to whitham s variables @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 by @xmath124 on eliminating @xmath43 and @xmath115 from the obtained equations we arrive precisely at ( [ eq.first ] ) . on eliminating either of @xmath43 and @xmath115 and all powers of @xmath116 greater than the first one , we get ( [ eq.second ] ) , as desired .",
    "it should be noted that the value of the phase shift @xmath99 derived from the numerical simulation contradicts @xcite . from the results of the paper",
    "it follows that the function @xmath37 tends to @xmath125 , as @xmath91 .",
    "but there is an arithmetical error in formula ( 17)@xcite and in formula ( 21)@xcite . the right calculation with using monodromic date from @xcite showed that @xmath126 tends to @xmath107 , and so @xmath127    * acknowledgements * the authors are greatly indepted to v. adler for first numerical experiments in this problem .",
