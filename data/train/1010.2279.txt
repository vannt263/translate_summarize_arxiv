    "it has become clear in the last decade that the distribution of galaxies is bimodal in color , and that this bimodality correlates with the structure ( or morphological type ) of galaxies @xcite .",
    "early - type galaxies are dominated by a spheroid of stars supported largely by random motions , and tend to have red colors and very low present - day star formation rates .",
    "they populate a tight color  magnitude relation ( cmr ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; the tightness of this cmr is an indicator of their rather ancient stellar populations @xcite . in contrast , late - type galaxies are dominated by a rotationally - supported disk of stars , and tend to have significant ongoing star formation at the present day , and populate a reasonably broad ( at optical wavelengths ) blue cloud whose colors reflect a combination of recent star formation and dust @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass functions for the two classes of galaxy are different ; early - type galaxies can extend to much higher stellar mass than late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "this bimodality persists at all redshifts up to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of the bimodality in the galaxy population is the observed correspondence between galaxy structure and stellar populations .",
    "models of galaxy formation in a cosmological context predict that the structure of a galaxy reflects the dynamical assembly ( merger history ) of a galaxy @xcite , whereas the cooling of gas and subsequent star formation is a property of the warm / hot reservoir of gas in a halo , which is relatively unaffected by galaxy interactions @xcite .",
    "galaxy formation models with ` standard ' ingredients  the formation and evolution of dark matter halos , gas cooling , star formation and stellar feedback  predict that almost all galaxies should be forming stars at an appreciable rate @xcite .",
    "this is in direct disagreement with observations of a red sequence , and is usually interpreted ( for good reasons ) as indicating not just a minor failing of ( admittedly uncertain ) prescriptions for these physical processes ; rather , this deficiency is interpreted as the signature of a completely separate physical mechanism .    in this",
    "regard , the empirical correlation between a lack of star formation and a prominent stellar spheroid ( bulge ) is an important clue to the mechanism suppressing star formation @xcite .",
    "a bulge appears to be a necessary ( but not sufficient ) requirement for the shut - down of star formation @xcite . taken together with the bulge mass  black hole mass correlation @xcite , it is not unreasonable to postulate that feedback from accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( active galactic nucleus [ agn ] feedback ) is an important mechanism by which galaxies quench their star formation @xcite ; although other physical mechanisms may also play a role ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite on gravitational heating , the influence of the development of virial shocks , and the heating of large halos with cosmic ray energy ) .",
    "galaxy merging plays a decisive role in this picture .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that a natural formation route for early - type galaxies ( in particular elliptical galaxies ) was through the major merger of two pre - existing galaxies ( although see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite for discussions of limitations of this obviously over - simplified picture ) . in the intervening time , an impressive variety of evidence has been amassed showing that the properties of early - type galaxies , at least at the broad level , are consistent with those expected for merger remnants : e.g. , overall kinematics @xcite , the widespread existence of kinematically - decoupled cores @xcite , the distribution of isophotal shapes @xcite , surface brightness profile shapes @xcite , and low - level tidal debris around many elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "observations of merger remnants support this picture also , having surface brightness profiles , velocity dispersions and sizes in the near - infrared that are similar to intermediate - luminosity early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is argued that shocks and non - circular motions in a galaxy merger cause the gas to lose angular momentum , leading to the growth of the black hole mass and conditions suitable for efficient coupling of energy from an agn to the diffuse gas in a galaxy @xcite .",
    "circumstantial support for this picture of merger - driven agn activity and feedback is seen in the tendency for the agn hosts to have intermediate colors ( between blue cloud and red sequence ; @xcite ) , rapidly - outflowing metal - enriched gas at @xmath4kpc from an active quasar at @xmath5 @xcite , and rapidly - outflowing gas ( @xmath6kms@xmath7 ) in post - starburst galaxies  such velocities are not expected to result from starburst - driven winds and were interpreted as being relics of a quasar - driven wind @xcite . in such a picture , the suppression ( or quenching ) of star formation is reasonably rapid and follows the merger event @xcite .",
    "another aspect that has come into focus in the last years is that the formation of red sequence ( and early - type ) galaxies is an ongoing process ; in particular , more than half of the early - type galaxy population has come into place since @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see @xcite and @xcite for analyses focused on the most massive galaxies ) .",
    "thus , one expects that the mergers ( that create the early - type galaxies ) and the physical processes that lead to the truncation of star formation ( that make those early - types red ) continue to happen at relatively recent times . in this case , these physical processes , and their late - time signatures , should be observable at the present day ( see @xcite for a detailed and thoughtful discussion of merging and early - type galaxy evolution in a cosmological context ) .    in this context ,",
    "the work of @xcite is of much importance .",
    "motivated by the merger hypothesis for the origin of early - type galaxies , they sought a correlation between fine structure ( from a tidal origin ) and color offset from the cmr ( in @xcite they did a similar work with a smaller sample with absorption line indices ) .",
    "if gas - rich mergers are the primary way in which early - type galaxies are made , then one expects a correlation between color offset and fine structure .",
    "@xcite found such a correlation with @xmath8 confidence , albeit with considerable scatter ; @xcite found a similar result with a complete sample of nearby ellipticals .",
    "@xcite used stellar population models to explore this result in more detail , finding that the early - type galaxy colors could be reproduced by a variety of post - merger ages from 2 to 6 gyr , depending on the model parameters used .    yet , a number of issues are left open by these works .",
    "number statistics was a clear issue in both cases ( e.g. , @xcite had a total of 69 galaxies in their sample ; @xcite had 55 galaxies in their sample ) , and testing with a larger sample is clearly desirable .",
    "the definition of fine structure adopted by @xcite is motivated by the type of tidal features regularly seen around nearby early - type galaxies @xcite , but has two limitations .",
    "firstly , it is impossible to measure their fine structure parameter automatically .",
    "@xcite partially remedied this by defining a reproducible metric that is readily applicable to deep data , although they studied a sample of elliptical galaxies only . secondly , high - contrast tidal features are often the result of _ minor _ mergers or accretions , not major mergers . finally , at the time at which @xcite was written , it was impossible to disentangle age and metallicity influences on spectral indices or colors ; it is important to verify that age is in fact the driving parameter of any correlations seen .",
    "cognizant of these issues , we have initiated an effort to confirm and expand on the landmark results of @xcite .",
    "we have defined a volume and @xmath9-band luminosity limited sample (  [ sec : data ] ) of @xmath1 early - type galaxies using the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , supplemented with redshifts from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we have used asymmetry as an automated and repeatable metric for tidally - induced structure , and have analyzed it in conjunction with sdss colors , and , crucially , ages and metallicities derived from absorption - line spectroscopy @xcite ; these parameters are described in  [ sec : color - asymm ] .",
    "because of our use of the sdss as our imaging data we analyze the brighter inner parts of early - type galaxies ( less sensitive diagnostic of faint tidal features ) but with the advantage of a larger sample ( over 600 galaxies ) .",
    "we present our results in  [ sec : results ] . finally , bearing in mind the insight gleaned from redshift surveys of red sequence and early - type galaxy evolution ,",
    "we were in a position to model the spectral properties of early - type galaxies more completely than @xcite ; this discussion is presented in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the casual reader is invited to skip to  [ sec : results ] directly , focusing in particular on figs .",
    "[ fig : asymm - color ] and [ fig : asymm - age ] . in",
    "what follows , we use ab magnitudes and assume h@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "our aim is to test the relationship between fine structure and color deviation from the cmr for early - type galaxies . in order to test this relationship ,",
    "a representative ( but not necessarily complete ) sample is required , and at distances close enough to allow us to discern both the global and tidal structure of early - type galaxies .",
    "accordingly , we have chosen galaxies within a relatively thin , and nearby , distance shell @xmath1 for study .",
    "the bulk of our sample can be drawn from the sdss , but the relatively bright galaxies in this sample lack sdss spectra ( for a variety of reasons , but partially because their fiber magnitudes were too bright to target as part of the sdss main survey ) .",
    "accordingly , we have taken a hybrid approach for this work .",
    "the primary object selection was made from the 2mass all - sky extended source catalog .",
    "we selected galaxies brighter than 13.5 mag in @xmath9 .",
    "we retrieved redshifts for these objects either from ned or sdss , matching the objects by position ; ned was used to fill in objects lacking spectroscopy from the sdss . in order to achieve a good redshift completeness we only included galaxies from regions of the sky that are fully covered by spectroscopic sample of the sdss dr3 .",
    "as described in detail by @xcite , from a comparison to the sdss main galaxy sample , it turns out that the k - band incompleteness of 2mass is modest and the only major source of incompleteness are blue low surface brightness disk galaxies . in order to check the completeness of our particular 2mass selection we follow a similar philosophy to @xcite and @xcite , by exploring the 2mass properties of galaxies selected in the optical regime .",
    "we selected a sample of galaxies with known redshifts and sdss photometry from ned . with the same procedure as described in @xcite , the sdss @xmath13 magnitudes and the redshifts were fit with stellar population template spectra derived using the pegase stellar population code ( see * ? ? ? * for an earlier version of the model ) .",
    "these template fits were used to estimate @xmath14-corrections for the sample , and permitted estimation of the @xmath9-band magnitude of a galaxy from the optical fluxes alone . in this way we could explore whether 2mass detected all the galaxies which one would _ a priori _",
    "expect to be detected .",
    "the integrated incompleteness is approximately 5% .",
    "[ fig : compl-2mass ] shows the color dependence of the completeness at @xmath1 , showing that the sample is less complete at bluer colors .",
    "figure  [ fig : compl - z ] shows the completeness of the redshift data coming from the two sources .",
    "sdss is most incomplete at the bright magnitudes , whereas in ned the completeness decreases with @xmath9 magnitude .",
    "this trend dominates the combined catalog , but the decrease of the completeness is much more moderate . with our selection criteria , at least one of the redshift data ( sdss or ned ) is available for 91% of the @xmath15 galaxies , the incompleteness mainly coming from faint , @xmath16 galaxies .    for the structural studies we select a nearby subsample which is volume limited between @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding and k - band absolute magnitude limit is @xmath17 ( which approximately corresponds to @xmath18 , @xcite ) .",
    "this sample contains 3006 galaxies .",
    "its estimated completeness is approximately 90% ; this completeness is dominated by the spectroscopic incompleteness ( largely from sdss , and this is primarily a geometric effect owing to the inability to place fibers on all objects ) coupled with a modest trend to miss out low surface brightness , blue objects ; for red galaxies , the focus of this work , the sample is essentially limited only by sdss fiber placement .",
    "we carried out image fitting with galfit to select early - type candidate systems .",
    "for fitting the galaxy profiles we constructed an automated pipeline involving programs sextractor version 2.3.2 @xcite and galfit version 2.0.3 .",
    "sextractor creates a catalog of sources from an astronomical image .",
    "the output parameters can be used to create an initial setup for light profile fitting with galfit .",
    "we pipeline was run on sdss @xmath19-band images . for each image ,",
    "sextractor was used to look up all sources and to identify the target galaxy , using sdss positions as input .",
    "besides our primary galaxy , we fit the nearby objects that could influence the light profile fit of the main galaxy .",
    "the selection of these secondary targets was made by distance and intensity : the object was ignored if the distance between the two objects exceeded 1.5 times the sum of their sizes , or the intensity of the secondary object was lower than 1% of the main object . in some cases sextractor",
    "identifies parts of the galaxies , such as large hii regions as separate objects . in order to correct these cases , check images",
    "were created with labeled fit targets .",
    "the images were visually inspected and unnecessary sources were untargeted .",
    "these results were used to create the galfit initial setup .",
    "the main target galaxies were fitted with a @xcite profile @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the effective radius of the galaxy , @xmath22 is the surface brightness at this radius , @xmath23 is the srsic index ( in the special case when @xmath24 we get the exponential profile , @xmath25 corresponds to de the vaucouleurs profile ) and @xmath26 so that the half of the flux is within @xmath21 . the nearby objects ( secondary targets )",
    "were fitted either by srsic or , if more star - like , by the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the psf was created from stars of each field image separately , based on moffat profile fits in the form : @xmath27^m } , \\label{eq : moffat}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the dispersion radius and @xmath29 is the power - law index .",
    "initial values for sky level , flux , size and axis ratio were set using sextractor output parameters .",
    "the srsic index and axis ratio for galaxies were set to initial values common for all objects , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the fit parameters were constrained using empirical ( observational ) and sextractor output information : @xmath23 was required to lie in the interval @xmath32 , axis ratio @xmath33 , position within 2 pixels of the sextractor value , and half - light radius between 0 and 1.5@xmath34 .",
    "the pipeline first fits the objects separately , keeping the other objects fixed , and then finally fits the objects all together in the end , using their separate fit results as the initial guess .",
    "the sky is fixed at all times .    one way to test",
    "the fitting pipeline is to fit simulated objects of known parameters .",
    "we used a suite of simulated galaxies composed from a srsic bulge + exponential disk , with a wide range of magnitudes , bulge to total ratios and light profile parameters .",
    "we selected a test sample similar to our sample of interest : bulge dominated systems , having bulge to total ratios @xmath35 and magnitudes brighter than @xmath36 ( the @xmath15 cut corresponds approximately to @xmath37 ) .",
    "the simulated galaxies were fit by the pipeline described above .",
    "the fits give us an important sanity check of the fitting procedure .",
    "our results show that srsic fit works relatively well , the simulated magnitudes are reproduced with an error @xmath38mag for the test sample .    when fitting the real images , the srsic fit is successful and gives results similar to the sdss photometric parameters for the majority of our galaxies .",
    "it also corrects the known error of the sdss imaging pipeline that it tends to split up large objects into multiple sources .",
    "this affects 4.6% of the objects in our sample , mostly objects with @xmath39 .",
    "the srsic fit fails in 1.5% of the cases because the fit did not converge or the image file was corrupt .",
    "1.9% of the fit results are unreliable because the fit did not move out from the initial setup or reached the fitting boundary .",
    "figure [ fig : fit - sersic - sdss ] shows the fitted sizes ( circularized @xmath40 ) compared with the sdss @xmath41 radii .",
    "the fit gives results consistent with the sdss sizes within 15% , when @xmath42 outliers are discarded .",
    "we choose @xmath43 galaxies for further study , which appears to be a reasonable way to automatically reject a significant fraction of the disk - dominated galaxies @xcite - band concentration as calculated by the sdss ( defined as the ratio of the aperture containing 90% of the flux in the petrosian radius to the half - light radius ) being larger than 2.6 @xcite was used , the sample would remain unchanged at the 90% level . ] .",
    "we further exclude all objects with failed fits , as described above .",
    "the criterion @xmath43 is deliberately generous , and includes a large number of galaxies with prominent disks @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we classified the @xmath43 subsample by eye , classifying 553 objects as elliptical ( pure bulge ; e ) , 498 as lenticular ( smooth , non - star - forming disk ; s0 ) , 479 as later types ( sa - irr ) and 27 as mergers .    we choose to visually exclude all galaxies with stars or companion / projected galaxies which made a major contribution to the asymmetry in the area in which asymmetry is measured .",
    "the spirit of this cut is to excise all systems where we were concerned that the asymmetry measurement would be corrupted by a non - interacting ( or non - strongly - interacting ) object ( be it a projection or an interaction ) . while some form of masking might have been desirable , we adopted this conservative approach to account for objects missed by sextractor and because the extent of the masked area is never straightforward to choose .",
    "we lose a little over 1/3 of the sample using this cut ( it is our most important cut ) , and the loss is primarily geometric ( and therefore introduces no bias ) for the galaxies lost from bright stars and projections , and those galaxies thrown out because of a pre - merger satellite .",
    "we have confirmed that the color  magnitude diagram of these excised galaxies is very similar to the final sample of galaxies without projections ( there are a few more outliers in the redwards and bluewards directions in the excised sample compared to the final sample , as is expected from a sample of galaxies where there is a projected star or galaxy contaminating the photometry ) .",
    "there is some natural fuzziness in this process , and some advanced mergers where the second nuclei ( and large amounts of tidal disturbance ) were within the asymmetry measurement area were included in the sample .",
    "after this final selection our sample contains 288 e and 319 s0 type galaxies , together 607 objects .",
    "for the investigation of the correlation between the post - merger structure and stellar population we need to construct two broad classes of metric : descriptions of the ( hopefully tidally - induced ) non - equilibrium structure of an early - type galaxy (  [ sec : asymm ] ) , and parameters characterizing the stellar population , like color , age , and metallicity (  [ sec : color - mag ] ) .",
    "we choose to use asymmetry as a repeatable diagnostic of non - equilibrium structure .",
    "this measure is insensitive to symmetric bars and rings ( unlike the residual structure measures used by @xcite ) , which are important structures in some s0s but are not ( at least unique ) indicators of a recent perturbation .",
    "our metric is not as tailored as the fine structure parameter used by @xcite , but the asymmetry measurement is repeatable and can be automatically applied to survey datasets .",
    "we adopt an asymmetry measure similar to methods discussed by @xcite .",
    "we measure asymmetry within an elliptical annulus of 0.83 @xmath21 . in this way",
    "we minimize the impact of the bright galaxy core on our asymmetry measure which would otherwise be very sensitive to centering uncertainties and the influence of dust disks and features in the inner part of early - type galaxies .",
    "galaxies with significant asymmetry often showed that the center of the brightest isophotes was offset from that of the fainter isophotes , yielding a change in the asymmetry with radius .",
    "we found that the galfit center was very close to a choice that minimized @xmath44 , with good s / n .",
    "accordingly , in what follows , we choose to use the galfit center , and omit the central regions from the asymmetry measure . ] .",
    "a different choice of the aperture does not influence the results qualitatively , unless the inner @xmath45 is included in the asymmetry measure .",
    "the asymmetry calculating algorithm is carried out as follows in the steps 1 - 7 , for an illustration see figure [ fig : asymm - def ] .    1 .",
    "rotate the image around the galfit center by 180@xmath46 .",
    "2 .   subtract the rotated image from the original one .",
    "3 .   integrate flux in quadrature within the elliptical annulus between 0.8 - 3 @xmath21 .",
    "this measure will have an additive contribution from noise which can be separated and corrected for .",
    "let us separate the flux @xmath47 into signal and noise term , @xmath48 and analogously for the rotated image @xmath49 .",
    "then the asymmetry flux @xmath50 integrated in quadrature over the image will read @xmath51 as signal and noise , as well as the both noise terms are uncorrelated .",
    "this will result in a non - zero asymmetry even in the case of @xmath52 , i.e. perfectly symmetric underlying signal .",
    "we can correct for this by estimating the noise contribution and subtracting it from the integral .",
    "we estimate @xmath53 using the galfit model image with noise similar to the observed data .",
    "4 .   apply poisson noise + read noise to the ( symmetric ) galfit model image .",
    "measure asymmetry in the same way as for the actual image ( steps 1 - 3 , rotate , subtract , integrate in quadrature )",
    "subtract model asymmetry from the object asymmetry .",
    "in the end we make the asymmetry measure independent of the total flux : normalize by the object ( sky subtracted image ) flux squared and integrated within the same area .    to summarize , our asymmetry measure is defined as @xmath54 where @xmath47 denotes the flux of the galaxy , @xmath29 is the fitted srsic model , the primes denote the corresponding quantities rotated by 180 degrees , and the summation goes over pixels within the elliptical annulus 0.8 - 3 @xmath21 . because the asymmetry is determined from the square of the asymmetry image , values of @xmath55 0.01 are already very highly significant , suggesting asymmetries involving @xmath56% of the flux ( this definition counts asymmetric flux from both the positive and negative parts of the asymmetry image ; other definitions divide the asymmetry by two to account for this effect ) .",
    "the uncertainties in asymmetry were calculated in two complementary ways .",
    "random uncertainties were estimated by subjecting symmetric model galaxies with realistic model and sky noise properties to the same procedure above ; these random uncertainties are @xmath57 , and are shown by the horizontal component of the cross - shaped error bars in figs .  [ fig : asymm - color ] , [ fig : asymm - age ] and [ fig : asymm - met ] .",
    "the second estimate of asymmetry uncertainty is systematic in nature , reflecting our choice to neglect the inner 0.8 @xmath21 when estimating the asymmetry ( in order to minimize the effect of small centering uncertainties , and the influence of small dust lanes or disks in the inner parts of these early - type galaxies ) .",
    "we changed the inner cutoff to 0.6 - 1 @xmath21 and the outer cutoff to 2 - 4 @xmath21 ; the result was that the asymmetries changed significantly , because of the different area being probed , but to first order all galaxies moved to higher or lower values of asymmetry together .",
    "experimentation revealed that the best way to visualize this source of uncertainty is as an uncertainty in asymmetry rank .",
    "the rank changed typically by @xmath56% ; we assign an asymmetry rank error of 5% , and for the purposes of visualization we translate this rank uncertainty into an asymmetry uncertainty using the asymmetries of galaxies that have ranks 5% different from the galaxy of interest .",
    "we show error bars calculated in this way in figs .",
    "[ fig : asymm - color ] , [ fig : asymm - age ] and [ fig : asymm - met ] as the solitary horizontal error bars .",
    "the @xmath44 uncertainties from this source are a strong function of @xmath44 , increasing from very small values for low values of @xmath44 to large values for the tail of galaxies extending to large @xmath44 .",
    "we choose for consideration in this work two types of stellar population diagnostics : galaxy colors , as an indicator of broad changes in the stellar population ; and luminosity - weighted stellar ages and metallicities  available for roughly 2/3 of the sample  as model - dependent but more information - rich stellar population diagnostics .",
    "we use sdss model @xmath58 color corrected for foreground extinction and ab offset , then k - corrected using method of @xcite .",
    "note that these colors are very similar to colors we measured ourselves within @xmath59 , and the results change only imperceptibly when such colors are used .",
    "we adopt the model colors because these are readily and publicly available .",
    "we assign uncertainties of 0.03 mag in g - r color to account for random photometric errors ( sub - dominant ) and calibration uncertainties from galaxy - to - galaxy in the zero - points of the sdss photometry ( the dominant contribution ) .",
    "the color combination @xmath58 was used because it is the bluest well - measured sdss color combination .",
    "while , in principle , @xmath60 color is more sensitive to stellar population ( as it straddles the 4000 break ) , @xmath61-band has poor s / n , and suffers from increased systematics compared to @xmath62-band .    in order to aid in disentangling the effects of the age / star formation history of a galaxy from metallicity in driving its color , we use estimates of luminosity - weighted age and metallicity from @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived ages and metallicities from all sdss spectra with median s / n@xmath63 per pixel .",
    "this stringent s / n cut selects only @xmath64 of all galaxies , primarily those with high surface brightness cores .",
    "our sample consists of e / s0 galaxies only , and therefore is much more complete than the whole sample : 97% of the es and s0s in the sample with sdss spectra in dr4 have age and metallicity estimates from @xcite .",
    "ages and metallicities are derived by comparing observed spectral absorption features ( three primarily age - sensitive indices , 4000 break strength d4000 , h@xmath65 , h@xmath66 h@xmath67 , and two primarily metallicity - sensitive indices @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69'$ ] ) with a library of @xcite models with a wide range of star formation histories and metallicities .",
    "the models have solar abundance ratio patterns ( i.e. , they do not allow for @xmath70-element enriched abundance patterns ) , but the impact of this shortcoming on the derived ages and metallicities is not that severe owing to the choice of combined magnesium and iron indices as the metallicity - sensitive indices ( see @xcite for details and more discussion ) . in this paper , the main emphasis is on the age estimates ( recall that the hypothesis being tested is that richly - structured early - type galaxies have younger ages ) , which depend primarily on the balmer lines and the strength of the 4000 - break .",
    "these ages are _ luminosity - weighted _ , i.e. , the ages are the mean luminosity - weighted ages of the models that provided a reasonable fit to the five observed spectral indices , and are correspondingly younger than the mass - weighted ages of those model populations .",
    "section 2.4 of @xcite discusses in detail the sources of random and systematic error in these age and metallicity estimates .",
    "briefly , random errors ( from the spectra themselves ) do not cause any systematic shifts in the median ages or metallicities from their correct values ( verified using simulations ) , and for our subsample lead to a typical uncertainty in log age of 0.1 dex and metallicity of 0.09 dex .",
    "the main systematic errors were identified to be alpha element overabundance uncertainties and the degree of burstiness in the star formation history of the galaxy population .",
    "the systematic errors in metallicity and log age from these sources was argued to be less than 0.05 dex for relatively large variations in alpha element overabundance and the fraction of galaxies undergoing large bursts ( we will discuss further these uncertainties in  [ agemet ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the luminosity - weighted ages are reasonably model - dependent , and depend on when star formation is assumed to start and to the timing and amplitudes of bursts of star formation .",
    "for example , a model with given line strengths could be fit by a population that started forming stars 12gyr ago , or only 5gyr ago ; this will naturally lead to dramatic differences in luminosity - weighted age .",
    "accordingly , in this work , we use luminosity - weighted ages primarily as a tool to understand _ relative _ trends in age , and to attempt to disentangle the effects of age and metallicity on broad - band colors .",
    "figure  [ fig : color - mag ] shows the cmr for the 605 e / s0 galaxies in our sample with measured asymmetries and sdss model magnitudes .",
    "we fitted a line to the main locus of the cmr , excluding blue outliers at @xmath71 from the fit .",
    "the equation of the fitted line is @xmath72 we subtract this linear relation from the color to get the color offset from the red sequence : @xmath73 .",

    ", it was argued that the ` fine structure ' being measured was a strong indication of a previous gas - rich galaxy merger .",

    "@xcite quote king s question to toomre at the 1977 yale conference : `` you showed us 10 merging pairs and then asked us to look for , or at least accept the existence of , 500 remnants from so long ago that they no longer bear the ` made by toomre ' label .",

'' . while @xcite argued that the blue , structured early - type galaxies in their study were reasonable candidates to fill the ` king gap ' , the considerable sensitivity of the evolution of the merger remnant to the properties of the merger and star formation after the merger made it difficult to reach a unique conclusion .    in this subsection",
    ", we revisit this issue with the benefit of more advanced stellar population models , and more critically , a more physically - motivated model for the color evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "we will argue that the systems explored in this paper ( and in @xcite ) fill the ` king gap ' , but that owing to natural scatter in the merger history of early - type galaxies and in the stellar populations of these newly - formed early - type galaxies , it is impossible to connect systems one - to - one with a given merger time with data of the type that we use here ; king s question was ill - posed , and will be very difficult to answer unambiguously .      clearly , there is a huge parameter space that can be explored when modeling the evolving early - type galaxy population , and arriving at a single unique picture that is clearly superior to the others will be impossible ( as clearly articulated and demonstrated by @xcite ) .",
    "we take an approach that is motivated by the last decade of research on the evolution of the early - type galaxy population .",
    "there are now a number of surveys that have empirically tracked the evolution of the stellar mass density in early - type galaxies , with the general result that the growth in stellar mass density is driven primarily by an increase in the _ number _ of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "star formation is shut off in blue star - forming galaxies , and the remnant fades and reddens onto the red sequence @xcite .",
    "the exact mechanisms that shut off star formation are still a matter of some debate ( merging and agn feedback , environment , or gas exhaustion are all possibilities ; furthermore , the balance of such processes and timescales on which they operate is likely to depend on a variety of parameters such as galaxy mass , or merger mass ratio ; e.g. , @xcite ) ; also open is the issue of how important any burst of star formation might be before the truncation of star formation ( see @xcite for a discussion of the average effects of galaxy mergers on star formation rate ) . notwithstanding",

    ", we will suppose that merging rearranges the stellar content of the remnant into a more spheroidal configuration and leads to the suppression of future star formation through agn feedback or some other mechanism .",
    "thus , we model a constantly - growing early - type galaxy population ( an exercise similar in spirit to , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) as a population of galaxies with constant star formation rate , that then stop forming stars at times drawn from the following probability distribution : @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the age of the galaxy in gyr . for concreteness",

    "one can see that after truncation of star formation , the model galaxy reddens rapidly , within @xmath115gyr , to within 0.1 mag of the red sequence .",
    "the subsequent reddening of the population is much slower .",
    "` typical ' structured early - type galaxies , with @xmath116 , would be interpreted to be between 2 and 8 gyr from their truncation event ( depending on metallicity ) , and the large magnitude of this metallicity - dependent scatter in truncation time for a given color offset presents a natural and appealing explanation for this phenomenology . ] .",
    "it is to be noted that this timescale ( in its value and scatter ) is in rough agreement with @xcite ; early - type galaxies less than @xmath117 from the locus of the color  magnitude are expected to be more than 1gyr from their ` creation event ' .",
    "the oldest red sequence galaxies are _ redder _ than the core of the cmr .",
    "this is one of the reasons that the locus of the cmr appears to evolve _ slower _ than an ageing stellar population in such models ; the average color of an early - type galaxy is always being pulled bluewards by new arrivals to the red sequence .",
    "we presented this relationship between truncation time and @xmath73 , but can it have any relationship to reality ( this , at some level , is the part of the question that @xcite were less able to address quantitatively ) ?",
    "put differently , in a model which is constrained to reproduce the number density evolution of early - type galaxies , is the color distribution of present - day early - type galaxies correctly predicted ?",
    "the result of this exercise is shown in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : maj ] .",
    "the solid histogram shows the color offsets from the red sequence of the data , and the dashed histogram the major merger model .",
    "the two distributions are clearly very similar : a ks test yields a @xmath118 chance of the two distributions being drawn from the same distribution , which is a remarkable achievement for what is essentially a blind prediction , using only the observed red sequence number density growth and an assumed metallicity scatter .    in the center and",
    "lower right - hand panels , we show light - weighted ages of the systems ( comparable to the ages derived by @xcite ) as a function of truncation time ( central panel ) , and the histogram of light - weighted ages ( lower panel ) .",
    "it is clear that the luminosity - weighted ages are skewed considerably towards older ages than the truncation times , as is expected from any model galaxies that have a constant star formation rate before the truncation of star formation .",
    "the distribution of ages is reasonably encouraging , and has the asymmetry characteristic of the data .",
    "the average age of the model is offset from the data ; inasmuch as luminosity - weighted ages are considerably more model - dependent than color this offset could be relatively easily remedied ( but is not here , for the sake of simplicity ) .",
    "for example , one could bring the start of star formation to @xmath119gyr in the past and adopt a different parameterization of the early stages of truncation of star formation in early - type galaxy progenitors .",
    "of course , minor mergers are much more frequent than major mergers , and are increasingly thought to be an important feature of the evolution of the early - type galaxy population ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the primary relevant effect here is that the minor merger of a gas - rich satellite onto a pre - existing early - type galaxy may drive the galaxy s color bluewards for a short time and induce asymmetry . in fig .",
    "[ fig : min ] , we show a model that is identical to the major merger model above , but with the early - type galaxy population undergoing the accretion of a star - forming galaxy in the last 8 gyr .",
    "the probability of accretion is modelled as being constant over the last 8 gyr , with a total probability of 1 that a given galaxy accretes a star - forming satellite over that period .",
    "the mass ratio is randomly chosen from a uniform distribution over the interval [ 0.0,0.4 ] ; the metallicity of the satellite is assumed to be identical to the primary galaxy for modeling convenience .",
    "[ fig : min ] shows many of the same phenomenologies as were seen in the major merger case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maj ] ) .",
    "the evolution of number of red sequence galaxies is similar , as is the color distribution produced at @xmath110gyr .",
    "the distribution of light - weighted ages is improved somewhat by the contribution of a small number of ( bright ) younger stars .",
    "furthermore , the relationship between @xmath73 and the ` last ' truncation time ( the time of the last event to take place , be it a major or minor merger ) is skewed considerably towards younger ages ; it is already possible to be very close to the red sequence locus only @xmath115gyr after a minor merger .",
    "thus , the two key conclusions of the modeling effort are : _",
    "i ) _ the full color distribution of early - type galaxies at the present day is consistent with being built - up through truncation of star formation ( as part of a merger event ) at the rate inferred through observations of the build - up of the red sequence , and _",
    "ii ) _ minor mergers can lead to considerable short - lived color offsets ( and presumably asymmetries ) , complicating considerably their interpretation .    despite the substantial scatter one expects in a major@xmath120minor merger model , the correlations shown in the central panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : min ] are still substantially stronger than the observed correlations between color / age and asymmetry ( although the correlations of @xcite are almost as strong as those in the central panels of fig .  [",

    "is found , and its @xmath121 is assigned to the galaxy of interest  asymmetry relation .",

    "it is clear that asymmetry and @xmath121 correlate only very weakly ; while structured galaxies have a weak tendency towards lower @xmath121 , there are a number of structured galaxies with high @xmath121 ( i.e. , rather red stellar populations ) . put differently",
    ", this figure attempts to encapsulate quantitatively the fact that _ neither _ the stellar population parameters _ nor _ the asymmetry are perfect clocks : the scatter in star formation history , gas content , mass ratio and details of the merger orbits appear to add very significant scatter to the relationship between the stellar population and structural ` clocks ' .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this kind of picture , while one expects a broad correlation between color offset from the red sequence and asymmetry ( as is observed ) , there will be a lot of scatter in this relationship for astrophysical reasons .",

    "they used very deep data for 55 systems and traced tidal structure out to large radius , where dynamical times are long .",
    "they found that a large fraction of systems were disturbed , and found a clear but scattered correlation between color offset from the cmr and residuals , as seen by @xcite .",
    "their results can be regarded as a high sensitivity analysis of the main body of the correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymm - color ] , where their higher sensitivity to faint debris has brought the color - residual correlation into sharp focus .",
    "our result complements this analysis by i ) using a larger sample and including s0 galaxies , showing it to be generally applicable to the population as a whole ( albeit with a lower sensitivity measure of structure , largely because of limitations in sdss depth ) , and ii ) using age measures to explicitly illustrate that the main driver of such behavior is an age  structure relation .      as alluded to in the previous sections ,",
    "a significant ( and largely unavoidable ) limitation of our study is the choice of asymmetry as a metric of tidally - induced disturbances .",
    "our choice of asymmetry was motivated by the overriding consideration that the measurement be algorithmic and reproducible ; asymmetry was chosen over other reproducible descriptions of structure ( such as residuals from a smooth model fit ; e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) to avoid symmetric bars or rings from contributing to our measure of structure . yet",
    ", a key limitation of our metric is that systems can be asymmetric for a variety of reasons : asymmetry may be produced by fly - bys or mergers , major or minor interactions , ongoing or past interactions , gas - rich or gas - poor mergers .",
    "as such , asymmetry is a valuable but ultimately blunt tool ; in this respect , our work is a useful way to start attacking the problem , but is not capable of answering higher - level , more detailed questions about the origin of the early - type galaxy population .    in principle",
    ", one could attempt to construct a richer description of structure , which would be more clearly correlated with particular types of interaction ( e.g. , a measure of the spatial scale of tidal debris , or a measure of the luminosity in tidal debris ) .",
    "calibration with simulations would be a critical step in the establishment of such metrics ( indeed , we have not yet calibrated our measure of asymmetry as part of this work ) . yet , in practice , such metrics have proven difficult to reliably construct ; the fine structure parameter of @xcite is a good example of such a metric , which may be more physically meaningful but is difficult to reproduce .",
    "one of the key predictions of the merger hypothesis for the origin of early - type galaxies is that tidally - induced asymmetric structure should correlate , at least in a broad sense , with signatures of a relatively young stellar population .",
    "motivated by this argument , @xcite studied the relationship between color offset from the cmr and tidally - induced fine structure , finding a correlation between the two quantities .",
    "they modeled the colors of these structured early - type galaxies , finding that such colors can be reproduced by a variety of models in which star formation truncates reasonably quickly , with typical timescales of a few gyr to reach the colors characteristic of ancient early - type galaxies ( although with much model dependence ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have re - examined this issue , incorporating a number of improvements over the work of @xcite : a sample from 2mass / ned and the sdss that is nearly ten times larger with well - measured colors ; the use of a non - ideal , but reproducible and meaningful metric for tidally - induced structure , asymmetry ; the use of luminosity - weighted ages and metallicities from the work of @xcite using the sdss ; and , the ability to construct a more physically - motivated model of early - type galaxy evolution with which to interpret the results .",
    "we found , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite , a correlation between offset from the cmr and asymmetry .",
    "inspection of asymmetric systems gave weight to the notion that the main driver of asymmetries was galaxy interactions ( although a variety of interactions can create asymmetries , leading to a natural ambiguity when interpreting the results ) .",
    "we demonstrated , for the first time , that age effects are driving this correlation .",
    "a fraction of asymmetric early - type galaxies have normal colors / ages , characteristic of mergers between already - formed early - type galaxies ( dry mergers ) .",
    "the empirical correlation between stellar population age and tidally - induced asymmetries , for the bulk of the population , is the key result of this paper , and is consistent with the basic prediction of the origin of early - type galaxies through galaxy merging , and their modification by accretion of gas - rich satellites .",
    "we interpreted these results in the context of a model in which the number of early - type galaxies is increasing constantly with time , in quantitative agreement with measurements of the evolving number density of red sequence ( early - type ) galaxies . assuming that the ultimate effect of a galaxy merger is to truncate star formation ( through either gas consumption or agn feedback ) , we find that such a model reproduces the distribution of color offsets from the cmr ; put differently , the merger hypothesis appears to give the correct distribution of present - day early - type galaxy colors . under the assumption that both light - weighted stellar",
    "age and asymmetry are good ` clocks ' of the time elapsed since the last major or minor merger , such a model predicts a rather tighter correlation between age and asymmetry than is observed .",
    "this indicates that astrophysical sources of scatter , e.g. , the star formation histories of the progenitors , their gas content , and mass ratios , play an important role in setting the properties of the remnants .",
    "thus , the broad correlation between age and asymmetry is in qualitative ( but not yet quantitative ) agreement with such a model .",
    "the existence of such a large scatter precludes the unambiguous identification of ` young ' early - type galaxies from stellar population and asymmetry data alone ; confirming the merger hypothesis using a few individual examples will be a challenging and ambiguous exercise .",
    "we conclude that the properties of the early - type galaxy population as a whole are consistent with the bulk of them being formed by galaxy merging ( some of these mergers are between already - formed early - type galaxies ) . in the case of stellar population parameters",
    ", there is a quantitative match between toy models of merger - driven growth and the observations . in the case of asymmetries ,",
    "the existence of a broad and scattered correlation between stellar population parameters and asymmetry is in qualitative agreement with the expectations from the merger hypothesis , but our toy models ( and even more sophisticated models ) are currently incapable of providing expectations for how asymmetry should vary with time and interaction phase .",
    "further work , using simulations to predict and calibrate the distributions of asymmetries , and using more sophisticated descriptors of galaxy structure , will help to more deeply explore this issue in the next years .",
