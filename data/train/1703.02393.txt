    "for a graph @xmath4 , the chromatic polynomial @xmath5 is an invariant which counts the number of proper colourings of @xmath4 when evaluated at a non - negative integer @xmath6 .",
    "however , the chromatic polynomial has an additional interpretation as the zero - temperature antiferromagnetic potts model of statistical mechanics .",
    "this has motivated research into the zeros of the chromatic polynomial by theoretical physicists as well as mathematicians .",
    "traditionally , the focus from a graph theory perspective has been the positive integer roots , which correspond to the graph not being properly colourable with @xmath6 colours .",
    "a growing body of work has begun to emerge in recent years more concerned with the behaviour of real or complex roots of the chromatic polynomial .",

    "in contrast , many other results show that certain regions are free from zeros . for planar graphs , the birkhoff ",
    "lewis theorem states that the interval @xmath7 is free from zeros . for more results along these lines , we direct the reader to the work of borgs  @xcite , jackson  @xcite , sokal @xcite , thomassen  @xcite and woodall  @xcite",
    ". perhaps one of the most compelling open questions concerning real zeros is to determine tight bounds on the largest real zero of the chromatic polynomial .",

    "for recent surveys see  @xcite and  @xcite .    in matroids ,",
    "the corresponding invariant is the characteristic polynomial .",

    "when @xmath8 has a loop , @xmath14 is defined to be zero .",

    "the characteristic polynomials of @xmath16 and @xmath17 play important roles in this paper , and these are easily computed . for a prime power @xmath0 , the projective geometry @xmath16 has lattice of flats isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of the @xmath10-dimensional vector space over @xmath2 .",
    "hence it has characteristic polynomial @xmath20 the largest root of the characteristic polynomial for a projective geometry is therefore @xmath21 .",

    "perhaps the most compelling open question concerning real zeros in this context is deciding whether there is an upper bound for the real roots of the characteristic polynomial of any matroid belonging to a specified minor - closed class .",
    "welsh conjectured that no cographic matroid has a characteristic polynomial with a root in @xmath23 .",
    "this was recently disproved by haggard et al . in  @xcite , and , in  @xcite , jacobsen and salas showed that there are cographic matroids whose characteristic polynomials have roots exceeding five .",
    "consequently , determining whether an upper bound exists for the roots of the characteristic polynomials of cographic matroids remains open . in  @xcite",
    ", royle conjectured that for any minor - closed class of @xmath2-representable matroids , not including all graphs , there is a bound on the largest real root of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "given the situation with cographic matroids , this is clearly a difficult conjecture to resolve in the affirmative .",
    "in contrast , the situation with graphic matroids has been resolved .",
    "thomassen  @xcite noted that by combining a result that he and woodall  @xcite had obtained independently with a result of mader  @xcite , one obtains the following .",

    "but since @xmath43 has a clique whose vertices comprise a vertex - cut , the chromatic polynomial of @xmath43 may also be expressed in terms of the chromatic polynomials of graphs with fewer vertices and having tree - width at most @xmath1 .    in this paper",

    "a given simple graph @xmath4 sits inside a clique on @xmath29 in the same way that a simple @xmath2-representable matroid @xmath8 with rank @xmath10 sits inside @xmath16 . in the above technique",
    ", edges are added to an  area \" of @xmath4 to form a clique restriction , so that the altered graph has a clique vertex - cut .",
    "this can be viewed as adding edges from the clique on @xmath29 to the graph @xmath4 to obtain a clique , across which our graph may be broken . in this paper , we show how to add elements from @xmath16 to a certain  area \" of @xmath8 in order to get a @xmath2-representable matroid with a certain projective geometry restriction , across which our matroid may be broken . the map that we use to break apart a matroid is a _ tree - decomposition _ , which was established by hlinn and whittle in  @xcite .",
    "they developed a matroid analogue of graph tree - width , which we define formally in section  [ tree ] .    in order to generalize thomassen s technique ,",
    "we first develop some tools for @xmath2-representable matroids of bounded _ matroid tree - width_. we then apply these tools to extend his argument to matroid tree - width , which we shall refer to simply as _ tree - width _ when the context is clear . in this way , we demonstrate the utility of these tools and simultaneously make progress towards royle s conjecture .",
    "an alternative way to prove theorem  [ graphy ] is to combine the observation that every graph with tree - width at most @xmath1 has a vertex of degree at most @xmath1 with lemma  [ oxco ] below , established by oxley for matroids and rediscovered for the special case of graphs by thomassen  @xcite and woodall  @xcite .",
    "we show that this proof technique may also be extended to representable matroids .",
    "in fact , this technique extends to a slightly more general class of matroids , namely matroids that exclude long line minors , which are considered in theorem  [ nolines ] .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the tree - width of a matroid is at least equal to the tree - width of each of its minors , thus the class of matroids with tree - width at most @xmath1 is closed under taking minors .",

    "however , this case is not especially interesting , because the rank of a matroid is always bounded below by its tree - width .",
    "our result gives a new bound for representable matroids with high rank and low tree - width .",
    "the requirement of representability is essential to the result .",
    "for instance , the characteristic polynomial of the @xmath19-point line , @xmath48 , has a root at @xmath49 .",
    "as @xmath48 has tree - width at most two , the @xmath19-point lines and their minors form a minor - closed class of matroids with bounded tree - width that do not have an upper bound for the roots of their characteristic polynomials . furthermore",
    ", the projective geometry @xmath50 has tree - width @xmath1 and its characteristic polynomial has a root at @xmath3 , hence the bound given is the best possible .",
    "lemma  [ twprop ] contains the basic results on tree - width necessary to justify these observations .",
    "given that the line @xmath48 is the simplest counter - example that we know of , it is natural to consider whether @xmath2-representability is necessary , or if excluding a long line minor from a matroid with bounded tree - width is sufficient to bound the roots of the characteristic polynomial , as suggested by geelen and nelson  @xcite .",
    "we show that this condition is indeed sufficient in the following theorem .",
    "note that , if @xmath0 is a prime power , then @xmath51 is an excluded minor for matroids representable over @xmath2 .",
    "thus the following theorem applies to a more general class of matroids than theorem  [ maincourse ] applies to , although the bound is different .",
    "[ nolines ] for an integer @xmath0 at least two , let @xmath8 be a matroid with tree - width at most @xmath1 and no minor isomorphic to @xmath51 . then @xmath44 is identically zero or else @xmath45 for all @xmath52 .    combining theorem  [ nolines ] with the observation that the characteristic polynomial of @xmath48 has a root at @xmath49 yields the following dichotomy .",
