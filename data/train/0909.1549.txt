    "a question of widespread interest is that of the specific shear viscosity ( shear viscosity per entropy density @xmath1 ) of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . ideal ( _ i.e. _ inviscid ) fluid dynamics has been quite successful in describing the transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) spectra and the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath3 of the bulk of the thousands of particles created in each , say , au+au collision @xcite .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiments improves further when one interfaces a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ideal fluid description of the qgp phase with a hadron cascade during the late expansion stage , in order to properly account for the highly viscous evolution after hadronization of the qgp @xcite .",
    "this success strongly suggests that the qgp fireball created at rhic thermalizes very quickly and behaves like an almost perfect liquid @xcite , which implies that it must be a strongly coupled plasma @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum mechanical uncertainty relation places a fundamental lower bound on the specific shear viscosity of any medium @xcite , and explicit computation in a large class of very strongly coupled quantum field theories ( unfortunately not including qcd ) suggests that this limit is close to the so - called kss bound @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "while this is a very small number ( almost two orders of magnitude smaller than that of any other known ( real ) fluid @xcite , with the possible exception of strongly interacting systems of ultracold fermionic atoms near the unitarity limit @xcite ) , it is known that the anisotropic elliptic flow generated in non - central relativistic heavy - ion collisions is very sensitive to shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "the roots of this sensitivity lie in the exceedingly rapid expansion of the heavy - ion collision fireballs , especially during the early expansion stage which is characterized by very large components of the velocity shear tensor @xcite .",
    "recent progress in performing causal relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of viscous fluids in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite revealed that even very small specific shear viscosities , close to the kss bound , should leave easily identifiable experimental signatures , in particular through a suppression of elliptic flow .",
    "that in the experimental data this suppression in not large enough to lead to immediate failure of the ideal fluid approach suggests that the qgp viscosity , in the temperature region probed by rhic collisions , must also be close to the kss bound @xcite .",
    "viscous hydrodynamics , in comparison with experimental data , allows in principle for an accurate determination of @xmath1 . in practice",
    ", this requires excellent control of several other inputs that either are presently not known with sufficient accuracy or have not yet been correctly implemented in the numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the largest prevailing uncertainty is related to the initial source deformation that drives the elliptic flow which is presently not known to better than 20 - 30% @xcite ( see , however , recent suggestions to eliminate this error source @xcite ) . as shown in @xcite , this leads at present to an @xmath5 uncertainty in the extracted @xmath1 value .",
    "two other effects of similar magnitude which , however , work against each other and may largely cancel , are strong viscous effects @xcite and the non - equilibrium chemical composition @xcite in the late hadronic phase .",
    "finally ( and this is the point of the present paper ) bulk viscous effects must be included in any study that aims to extract the specific shear viscosity @xcite . however , even when making generous allowances for all these uncertainties , it appears clear that the effective shear viscosity to entropy ratio of the qgp , averaged over the expansion history of the fireballs created in rhic collisions , can not exceed the conservative upper limit @xmath6 this makes the qgp the most perfect liquid ever observed in the laboratory .    in the present paper",
    "we use the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous relativistic fluid dynamic code vish2 + 1 @xcite to study the effects of bulk viscosity and their interplay with shear viscosity in the buildup of radial and elliptic flow .",
    "some preliminary results were reported in @xcite ( see also @xcite for related work ) .",
    "our work is preceded by three ( 0 + 1)-dimensional studies for systems undergoing boost - invariant longitudinal expansion without transverse flow @xcite which explored the suggestion by torrieri , tomik and mishustin @xcite that in rapidly expanding fireballs bulk viscosity can lead to such large negative bulk pressures that the fluid becomes mechanically unstable against clustering and cavitation . since bulk viscosity is expected to be maximal near the quark - hadron phase transition ( see discussion in section  [ sec2 ] ) , those studies predicted that bulk viscous effects become important mostly during the second half of the fireball expansion when the qgp undergoes hadronization . at that time the scalar expansion rate @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 the flow 4-velocity ) , which for 1-dimensional boost - invariant expansion equals @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the longitudinal proper time , with @xmath11 indicating the longitudinal or beam direction ) , is already small enough to significantly temper the growth ( in magnitude ) of the ( negative ) bulk pressure , leading to instability problems only for relatively large peak values for the specific bulk viscosity @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "our work improves on these analysis by including a realistic initial transverse density profile and the resulting transverse flow in the fireball .",
    "this has two important consequences : ( i ) the transverse flow increases the expansion rate @xmath13 , leading to larger bulk pressures @xmath14 for given @xmath12 .",
    "( ii ) some of the matter near the dilute transverse edge of the fireball experiences large bulk viscosities already at very early times where the expansion rate @xmath15 is big .",
    "this leads to much more severe problems with mechanical instability in vish2 + 1 than for simple 1-dimensional expansion , and to correspondingly smaller values for the upper limit for @xmath12 that allows for stable hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "even more restrictive than the condition for mechanical stability is the self - consistency constraint for the validity of viscous hydrodynamics itself : the entire framework , which is based on a near - equilibrium expansion , breaks down when viscous corrections to the local equilibrium distribution function become comparable to the thermal equilibrium terms .",
    "we will show that this happens , for particles with typical momenta @xmath16 , even before the effective total pressure becomes negative and mechanical instability sets in @xcite . while the formalism may be able to qualitatively indicate where and when cavitation sets in @xcite , we doubt that the phenomenon itself can be self - consistently described within the existing viscous hydrodynamic frameworks .",
    "obviously , viscous hydrodynamics can predict the viscous suppression of elliptic flow reliably only within its domain of validity .",
    "we therefore restrict our attention to the parameter range where the bulk viscous pressure stays everywhere sufficiently small that stable hydrodynamic evolution is ensured . within that range ( which we determine )",
    ", we study the effects of bulk viscosity and of the microscopic relaxation time for the bulk viscous pressure on radial and elliptic flow , with and without additional shear viscosity . for a fluid with constant specific shear viscosity @xmath17",
    "we find that , depending on initial conditions and details of the temperature dependence of the relaxation time , bulk viscosity increases the viscous suppression of @xmath3 by 5  50% .",
    "this large range indicates not only that bulk viscosity is a potentially serious contaminant in the extraction of the specific shear viscosity @xmath1 from elliptic flow data , but also that a robust theoretical effort is needed to better constrain the range of reasonable values for the bulk viscosity and its associated relaxation time .",
    "we find that the uncertainty range is drastically reduced , to the @xmath18 level , if we impose proportionality between the specific bulk viscosity and its associated relaxation time , as indicated by kinetic theory .",
    "the critical growth of the specific bulk viscosity near the quark - hadron phase transition is then accompanied by critical slowing down of the dynamics of the viscous bulk pressure .",
    "this diminishes the bulk viscous contribution to the viscous suppression of elliptic flow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we review the present state of knowledge of the temperature dependence of the specific bulk and shear viscosities @xmath12 and @xmath1 and their associated microscopic relaxation times . based on this analysis we introduce specific parametrizations for @xmath19 and the bulk pressure relaxation time @xmath20 which we use later in the numerical simulations .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] gives a brief summary of specific features of the viscous hydrodynamic equations solved in this work , referring to earlier work for a more general description . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we discuss generic effects of bulk and shear viscosity on the hydrodynamic evolution of fireball eccentricity and flow and their implications for the final hadron spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] discusses the sensitivity of bulk viscous effects to the initialization of the bulk viscous pressure and to its relaxation time . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "we explore the range of bulk viscosities that allows for stable viscous hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "consequences of bulk viscous effects for the extraction of the specific shear viscosity @xmath1 from experimental elliptic flow data are discussed in section  [ sec7 ] before summarizing our findings in section  [ sec8 ] .",
    "the present state of knowledge of the viscous properties of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures is nicely reviewed in @xcite to which we refer for details .",
    "kinetic theory @xcite and experiment @xcite show that for non - relativistic fluids the _ specific shear viscosity _",
    "@xmath1 typically reaches a minimum near the liquid - gas phase transition , rising both towards lower temperatures in the liquid phase and towards higher temperatures in the gas phase .",
    "lattice qcd @xcite , perturbative qcd @xcite , and hadron cascade simulations @xcite indicate that relativistic qcd matter behaves analogously , but with the liquid and gas phases interchanged ( the liquid qgp phase exists at higher temperature than the hadronic gas phase ) .",
    "according to perturbative @xcite and lattice @xcite qcd , the increase of @xmath1 with temperature in the qgp phase is weak over the temperature range explored in rhic collisions , suggestion the use of a constant @xmath1 for the qgp in hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we here use the smallest value for this constant permitted by the kss conjecture @xcite , @xmath21 , in order to extract reasonable upper bounds for the uncertainties introduced by bulk viscous effects into the extraction of such a small value from experimental data .",
    "[ we note that the assumption of a constant @xmath1 is unacceptable for quantitative attempts to extract it from heavy - ion collision data ; at least one must account for a significant increase of this ratio during hadronization and in the late hadronic phase @xcite . ]    the _ relaxation time @xmath22 for the shear viscous pressure tensor _",

    "kinetic theory gives @xmath29 where @xmath30 in relaxation time approximation @xcite and @xmath31 for a system of photons radiated by massive particles in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the complete leading order result for weakly coupled qcd @xcite is roughly consistent with the latter of these two , but adds a weak ( decreasing ) temperature dependence . at high temperatures @xmath32 , so the ratio @xmath33 is small of second order in the deviation",
    ". for strongly coupled @xmath24 sym theory one obtains a lower bound for this ratio which is only linear in this deviation and thus much larger : @xmath34 @xcite . for the hadron gas different authors @xcite agree that @xmath35 just below @xmath0 and that this ratio decreases towards lower temperatures .",
    "there is no agreement on the sign of the temperature dependence of the specific bulk viscosity @xmath12 itself which according to @xcite increases towards lower temperature for massive pions , but decreaes for massless pions @xcite .",
    "however , there are general arguments @xcite that support the idea that @xmath12 should peak near the quark - hadron phase transition , due to long - range correlations related to the restoration of chiral symmetry ; at a second - order critical point @xmath12 is predicted to diverge @xcite .",
    "we assume here that @xmath12 quickly approaches zero once @xmath36 decreases below @xmath0 ; above @xmath0 , we parametrize it as @xmath37 ( which corresponds to the buchel bound @xcite for @xmath38 ) , using @xmath39 extracted from the same lattice qcd data @xcite that we used for our equation of state ( eos  l , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the factor @xmath40 increases as we approach @xmath0 from above ; the resulting increase of @xmath12 is qualitatively , but not quantitatively consistent with a direct extraction of @xmath12 from lattice qcd @xcite ( for a critical discussion of this extraction see @xcite ) and with recent work in `` holographic qcd '' @xcite .",
    "we connect our parametrization above @xmath0 to the assumed zero value for @xmath12 well below @xmath0 by interpolating with a gaussian function ( see fig .",
    "this results in a peak value @xmath41  about half as big as our choice for the ( temperature independent ) specific shear viscosity @xmath1 and consistent with strong coupling estimates for strongly coupled conformal field theories using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite ( which was also used by buchel when deriving his bound ) and with holographic qcd @xcite .",
    "it is , however , more than 10 times smaller than both the lattice qcd value extracted by meyer @xcite and a recent ads / cft - based estimate by buchel for a non - conformal plasma @xcite .",
    "we will see that this factor 10 has crucial implications for the applicability of viscous hydrodynamics . to simulate larger bulk viscosities , we scale the function shown in fig .  [ f1 ] ( to which we will refer as `` minimal bulk viscosity '' for brevity ) by a constant factor @xmath42 .",

    "it is easy to see that _ isotropic _ radial expansion is enough to decreases the spatial eccentricity @xmath92 @xcite ; _ anisotropic _ flow , with larger flow velocities in the reaction plane than perpendicular to it , only accelerates the rate with which it decreases . at late times , the eccentricity for the shear viscous fluid decreases more slowly than for the ideal one , since the ideal fluid develops _ stronger elliptic flow _ ( see fig .  [ f3]b and following discussion ) .",

    "the difference between @xmath93 ( dash - dotted lines ) and @xmath95 ( solid lines ) stems from the viscous pressure components in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it reflects a contribution to the momentum anisotropy that does not arise from anisotropic collective flow but from viscous deviations from isotropy of the microscopic momentum distribution @xmath96 in the local fluid rest frame @xcite , accounted for by the non - ideal terms in @xmath55 .",

    "since these findings contradict at least our own naive first expectations , we briefly reiterate the main point : taking into account the critical slowing down of the bulk viscous pressure dynamics near @xmath0 where @xmath12 becomes large leads to _ weaker _ bulk viscous suppression effects on the elliptic flow than seen for both short and long _ constant _ ( _ i.e. _ @xmath36-independent ) relaxation times @xmath43 .",

    "when one tries to simply multiply the function shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] by @xmath118 , one finds that ( except for special circumstances discussed below ) the viscous hydrodynamic code crashes .",
    "the reason is that sufficiently large bulk viscosity can lead to fireball regions where the effective total isotropic pressure @xmath119 ( thermal + bulk viscous pressure ) becomes negative and the medium becomes mechanically unstable and will tend to break up @xcite .",
    "in fact , since certain components of the shear viscous pressure ( in particular its longitudinal component @xmath120 ) are usually also negative , instability can set in even somewhat earlier @xcite .",
    "in numerical simulations this manifests itself through the exponential amplification of local numerical errors which will eventually stop the code from running .",
    "we point out that even before the fluid becomes mechanically unstable one has left the region of applicability of viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "the viscous hydrodynamic formalism is based on a near - equilibrium expansion ; its validity assumes that the viscous corrections to the energy - momentum tensor are small compared with the ideal fluid terms . in other words , if the condition @xmath121 is violated for any component @xmath122 , the evolution based on equations ( [ eq2]-[eq4 ] ) can no longer be trusted . ignoring the shear pressure and setting @xmath123 for a qgp",
    ", the instability threshold @xmath124 translates into @xmath125 which is not sufficiently small to trust the continued validity of the equations .",
    "the following alternate consideration leads to the same conclusion : if the fluid can be described by quasiparticles , the viscous terms in the energy - momentum tensor correspond to deviations of the local phase - space distribution @xmath126 from local equilibrium . using grad s 14-moment method ,",
    "the deviation @xmath98 is expanded up to quadratic order in momentum @xcite and ( for a fluid with only bulk viscosity and massless particles at midrapidity @xmath127 ) can thus be written in the form @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a slowly varying function of temperature with magnitude of order unity @xcite .",
    "when @xmath124 such that @xmath130 , this means that for midrapidity particles with typical thermal momenta @xmath131 the deviation @xmath132 is negative with magnitude 1 or larger , rendering the total distribution function @xmath133 negative , which is unphysical .",

    "however , in contrast to the n - s initialization , the @xmath142 curves now show a strong dependence on relaxation time @xmath43 , rising monotonically with @xmath43 .",

    "the bulk pressure , starting at zero , never grows sufficiently large to threaten mechanical stability of the fluid , irrespective of how large the bulk viscosity becomes at @xmath0 ! as the peak value @xmath154 is increased , so is the time it takes @xmath44 to evolve towards its navier - stokes value , and this never happens fast enough to violate the stability condition @xmath141 .",
    "figure  [ f6]b shows the viscous entropy production for the maximally allowed bulk viscosities shown in fig .  [ f6]a .",

    "more precisely , if the qgp should turn out to be a `` most perfect liquid '' with `` minimal '' shear viscosity @xmath157 , with what kind of accuracy can we hope to verify this experimentally if bulk viscosity is the only quantity beyond our theoretical and experimental control ?    to answer this question , we used vish2 + 1 to compute the differential elliptic flow of directly emitted pions ( without resonance decay contributions ) for @xmath158gev au+au collisions at @xmath82fm , assuming the fireball medium to have constant specific shear viscosity @xmath157 but allowing the bulk viscosity @xmath12 to vary over the entire range allowed by the mechanical stability criterium @xmath141 . in doing",
    "so we assumed a fixed shape of the temperature dependence of @xmath12 as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] but let its normalization vary between @xmath53 and @xmath147 where the latter is the largest value within the range of applicability of israel - stewart viscous fluid dynamics , shown in fig .",
    "we allowed for two fixed values of 0.5 and 5fm/@xmath51 for the bulk viscous relaxation time @xmath43 as well as for `` critical slowing down '' according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , and we studied both zero and navier - stokes initial values for the viscous pressure components .",
    "all calculations assume @xmath71fm/@xmath51 as starting time .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] and table  [ t1 ] .",
    "generically one observes that , even for minimal shear viscosity near the kss bound , the shear viscous contribution to the elliptic flow suppression far exceeds the bulk viscous contribution .",
    "this is good news since it means that the uncertainty introduced into the extraction of @xmath1 by theoretically poorly controlled bulk viscous effects remains limited and is , in fact , quite small , especially if the real fireballs created in heavy - ion collisions do not completely saturate the kss bound . on a more quantitative level",
    ", one finds that for pions with typical transverse momentum @xmath104gev/@xmath51 the elliptic flow is suppressed by just over 16% below the ideal fluid value if the expanding matter has only shear , but no bulk viscosity , and that this suppression increases to values between 17% and 25% if bulk viscosity is added .",
    "the largest bulk viscous suppression is found for fixed relaxation times @xmath43 and zero initialization if the bulk viscosity is increased all the way up to its upper allowed limit . in these cases",
    "the additional suppression can be as large as 50% of the suppression found for the fluid with only ( minimal ) shear viscosity .",
    "if one takes into account that the evolution of the bulk viscous pressure slows down near @xmath0 where @xmath12 is largest , the additional bulk viscous suppression never exceeds 20% of the shear viscous elliptic flow suppression , with 10 - 15% being a typical range ( light blue and green curves in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) .",
    "an important caveat is , however , that for navier - stokes initial conditions the allowed maximal bulk viscosities are small , much below recent lattice qcd estimates @xcite . if larger values are realized by nature , they invalidate the use of viscous hydrodynamics , at least at early times @xcite .",
    "the problems in this case arise from the large bulk viscosity in a thin layer near the transverse edge of the fireball where the matter is close to @xmath0 .",
    "it is only in this region that the viscous hydrodynamic description breaks down . since the problematic factor",
    ", the scalar expansion rate @xmath13 , decreases initially very rapidly , these initially unstable fluid regions move quickly back to mechancal stability .",
    "since the momentum anisotropy does not develop instantaneously , we find it hard to believe that the existence of this unstable external layer has much influence on the evolution and final value of the elliptic flow , and one should get very similar results from simulations in which the initial bulk viscous pressure @xmath44 is restricted by hand to values below the threshold for violating the positivity condition @xmath141 . if this is indeed the case , the results presented in this section show that bulk viscosity , even if theoretically not well controlled , will not introduce large uncertainties into the extraction of @xmath1 from elliptic flow data .",
    "the present study shows that bulk viscosity , as long as it is small enough that in expanding heavy - ion collision fireballs the negative bulk viscous pressure does not become larger than the thermodynamic pressure , affects the elliptic flow of the final hadrons much more weakly than does shear viscosity .",
    "so , as long as the expanding fireball can be described by viscous fluid dynamics , it is possible to extract its shear viscosity ( even if it is as small as @xmath159 ) with good accuracy from a comparison of viscous hydrodynamic simulations with experimental elliptic flow data .",
    "accounting for the critical slowing down of viscous bulk pressure dynamics near @xmath0 , we showed that any contamination from bulk viscosity @xmath12 is @xmath160 ( for much of the parameter space it is even @xmath161 ) , and that its relative importance decreases further if @xmath1 is larger than the kss bound .",
    "however , we also saw that the stability condition @xmath141 is very restrictive and easily violated if the peak value of @xmath12 near @xmath0 reaches values close to those estimated from lattice qcd @xcite and from some strong coupling approaches @xcite , _ and _ if the bulk viscous pressure @xmath44 approaches its navier - stokes limit @xmath162 .",
    "when this occurs ( typically at early times when the scalar expansion rate is largest , in a thin layer around @xmath0 close to the transverse edge of the fireball ) , the viscous fluid dynamical description breaks down .",
    "our analysis shows that the phenomenon of `` critical slowing down '' can play a crucial role in preventing this from happening .",
    "kinetic theory for weakly coupled systems @xcite and a recent analysis by buchel of strongly coupled systems @xcite suggest that the same microscopic physics ( namely growing correlation lengths due to critical fluctuations ) that generate a peak of @xmath12 at @xmath0 also causes the relaxation time @xmath43 for the bulk viscous pressure to grow and possibly diverge at @xmath0 even while @xmath12 itself remains finite . when using the model eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for a temperature dependent @xmath43 inspired by these ideas we saw that , unless @xmath44 is initialized at its navier - stokes limit , it never reaches it during the short time span of a heavy - ion collision in those fireball region where @xmath12 peaks and @xmath44 could thus become very large .",
    "this reduces the problem of applicability of viscous hydrodynamics at early times to a question of initial conditions for @xmath44 , especially in that thin transverse layer where ( after local equilibrium is reached ) the temperature happens to be close to @xmath0 .",
    "determining these initial conditions ( as opposed to guessing them as we have done here ) requires a theoretical description of the early pre - equilibrium evolution and landau - matching the corresponding energy - momentum tensor to its viscous fluid dynamic form , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ( in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite but generalized from 0 + 1 to 2 + 1 dimensions ) . at this point",
    "we lack the tools for doing this .",
    "let us , however , make a few comments in anticipation of completion of that task .",
    "consider a small fireball region that is just reaching local thermal equilibrium at a temperature close to @xmath0 and undergoing self - similar boost - invariant longitudinal expansion while transverse expansion is negligible .",
    "let us also assume that at this point in time the bulk viscous pressure in the region is large and negative , leading to negative effective total isotropic pressure and causing the fluid to be mechanically unstable .",
    "what will happen ?",
    "the fluid will begin to rupture , forming little voids , and if the region were to remain in a state of negative total pressure , it would eventually fragment .",
    "however , since the considered region is undergoing rapid expansion and cooling , it will quickly exit from its state of mechanical instability . furthermore , during the short period of instability the hydrodynamic growth of voids will be hampered by the large value of the relaxation time @xmath43 . by the time the considered region becomes mechanically stable again , we expect it to be riddled with small holes , but otherwise intact .",
    "the small voids formed during the period of instability will re - collapse by cavitation , and the region will quickly re - equilibrate due to the now much shorter relaxation time below @xmath0 . no wholesale breakup of the fluid will occur , due to lack of time .",
    "similar arguments hold later when the bulk of the matter in the center of the fireball passes through @xmath0 , only that in this case the viscous bulk pressure may never grow large enough to generate mechanical instability , due to critical slowing down .    in summary , unlike the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not expect any dramatic macroscopic phenomena triggered by the transient mechanical instability arising from possibly large , but short - lived negative bulk pressures in fireball regions passing through the hadronization phase transition .",
    "for this reason we believe that a modified viscous hydrodynamic treatment , where one limits _ by hand _",
    "the growth of the viscous bulk pressure so that it always remains below the instability threshold @xcite , will not lead to impermissible distortions of the real ( non - equilibrium ) dynamics in the ( small ) space - time regions whose description lies outside the hydrodynamic domain .",
    "this is important for future viscous hydrodynamic studies of heavy - ion collisions with fluctuating and granular initial conditions @xcite which are more realistic than the smooth initial profiles presently used .",
