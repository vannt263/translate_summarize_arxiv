    "recent solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments have convincingly verified the hypothesis of neutrino oscillation , a quantum phenomenon which can naturally happen if neutrinos are slightly massive and lepton flavors are not conserved .",
    "the mixing of lepton flavors is described by a @xmath8 unitary matrix @xmath9 , whose nine elements are commonly parameterized in terms of three rotation angles ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) and three cp - violating phases ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) @xcite . the phase parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which have nothing to do with cp violation in neutrino oscillations , are usually referred as to the majorana phases . a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data",
    "yields @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 at the @xmath19 confidence level @xcite , but three phases of @xmath9 remain entirely unconstrained .",
    "while the absolute mass scale of three neutrinos is not yet fixed , their two mass - squared differences have already been determined to a good degree of accuracy @xcite : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the on - going and forthcoming neutrino oscillation experiments will shed light on the sign of @xmath22 , the magnitude of @xmath12 and even the cp - violating phase @xmath13 .    from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", at least two lessons can be learnt from current experimental data :    * the lightest neutrino is allowed to be massless ; i.e. , either @xmath0 ( normal neutrino mass hierarchy ) or @xmath1 ( inverted neutrino mass hierarchy ) has no conflict with the present neutrino oscillation measurements . in both cases ,",
    "the non - vanishing neutrino masses can be determined in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 whether one of the above two neutrino mass spectra is true or essentially true remains an open question .",
    "but we stress that some interesting neutrino models , such as the minimal seesaw model @xcite , are actually able to predict the neutrino mass spectrum with either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "* a special neutrino mixing pattern , the so - called tri - bimaximal mixing @xcite , @xmath26 is particularly favored .",
    "it yields @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) for the large - mixing - angle msw solution @xcite to the solar neutrino problem , @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) for the atmospheric neutrino oscillation , and @xmath31 . as a direct consequence of @xmath32 ,",
    "the cp - violating phase @xmath13 is not well defined .",
    "this interesting neutrino mixing pattern is in general expected to result from an underlying flavor symmetry ( e.g. , the discrete @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34 @xcite or @xmath35-@xmath36 @xcite symmetry ) in the lepton sector .",
    "such a symmetry must be broken spontaneously or explicitly , in order to account for both the observed lepton mass spectra and the realistic neutrino mixing pattern .",
    "one purpose of this paper is just to combine both lessons and reconstruct the simplest neutrino mass texture for either @xmath37 or @xmath1 .",
    "looking back to eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we find that @xmath38 and @xmath39 hold in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cases , respectively .",
    "this observation implies that a realistic neutrino mass texture can be established by starting from the symmetry limit ( a ) @xmath2 and @xmath40 or ( b ) @xmath41 and @xmath1 . we shall show that it is possible to introduce a particular perturbation , which ensures the resultant neutrino mass matrix @xmath42 to reproduce the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern or its viable variations with all entries being formed from small integers and their square roots .",
    "the second purpose of this paper is to incorporate the texture of @xmath42 in the minimal type - ii seesaw model @xcite , an economical extension of the standard model with only one heavy right - handed majorana neutrino @xmath5 in addition to the @xmath6 higgs triplet @xmath7 .",
    "we shall focus our interest on the @xmath1 case , so as to obtain a non - vanishing cp - violating asymmetry in the lepton - number - violating decays of @xmath5 .",
    "such an asymmetry arises from the interference between the tree - level amplitude of @xmath5 decays and the one - loop vertex correction mediated by @xmath7 .",
    "following the idea of baryogenesis via leptogenesis @xcite and taking account of the flavor - dependent effects @xcite , we shall show that it is possible to interpret the observed baryon number asymmetry of the universe ( i.e. , @xmath43 @xcite ) via thermal leptogenesis in our model , in which only the electron flavor plays a role in the lepton - to - baryon conversion .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe a purely phenomenological way to get viable variations of the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern from two simple textures of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath42 , one with @xmath0 and the other with @xmath1 .",
    "section iii is devoted to incorporating the texture of @xmath42 with @xmath1 and a non - trivial cp - violating phase in the minimal type - ii seesaw model , and to calculating the flavor - dependent leptogenesis in order to account for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry @xmath44 .",
    "a brief summary of our main results is presented in section iv .",
    "let us work in the basis where the flavor eigenstates of three charged leptons are identified with their mass eigenstates ( i.e. , the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath45 is diagonal , real and positive ) .",
    "then the mass eigenstates of three neutrinos ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) are directly linked to their flavor eigenstates ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) through the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath9 . if @xmath9 is of the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern as given in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , it can be decomposed into a product of two euler rotation matrices : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 with @xmath54 . allowing for small deviations of @xmath55 from unity ,",
    "we are then left with some variations of the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern which can fit current or future neutrino oscillation data to a better degree of accuracy .",
    "our strategy of reconstructing the neutrino mass matrix @xmath42 is three - fold : ( 1 ) we take a proper symmetry limit of @xmath42 , denoted as @xmath56 , which can be diagonalized by the orthogonal transformation @xmath57 ; ( 2 ) we introduce a particular perturbation to @xmath56 , denoted as @xmath58 , which can be diagonalized by the orthogonal transformation @xmath59 ; ( 3 ) we require that @xmath60 should also be diagonalized by the transformation @xmath61 . of course",
    ", the texture of @xmath42 ought to guarantee either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "in the @xmath0 case , we observe from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that @xmath62 holds .",
    "hence a reasonable symmetry limit of @xmath42 is expected to be @xmath63 where @xmath64 is assumed to be real and positive .",
    "the @xmath65 permutation symmetry in the @xmath66 sector of @xmath56 assures that this mass matrix can be diagonalized by the @xmath57 transformation : @xmath67 in other words , @xmath68 and @xmath69 hold in the chosen symmetry limit .",
    "a non - vanishing value of @xmath70 and a generalized tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern can result from the perturbation @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a small dimensionless quantity , and @xmath55 is a positive number of @xmath73 .",
    "when @xmath74 holds , @xmath75 has the @xmath65 permutation symmetry in its @xmath76 sector .",
    "given the orthogonal transformations in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the diagonalization @xmath77 works . the neutrino mass matrix @xmath78 \\ ; %       ( 9)\\ ] ] can then be diagonalized by the unitary matrix @xmath79 : @xmath80 three neutrino mass eigenvalues of @xmath42 turn out to be @xmath0 , @xmath81 and @xmath68 .",
    "taking account of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we immediately obtain the results @xmath82 ev and @xmath83 \\approx 0.35/\\left ( 2+x^2 \\right ) $ ] .      in the @xmath1 case ,",
    "we observe from eq .",
    "( 2 ) that @xmath84 holds .",
    "thus a reasonable symmetry limit of @xmath42 is expected to be @xmath85 where @xmath64 is also assumed to be real and positive .",
    "this neutrino mass matrix can similarly be diagonalized by the @xmath57 transformation : @xmath86 namely , @xmath87 and @xmath1 hold in the chosen symmetry limit . to break the degeneracy of @xmath88 and @xmath70",
    ", we may introduce the same perturbation to @xmath56 as that given in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , which can be diagonalized by the same transformation as that shown in eq .",
    "it is then possible to diagonalize the neutrino mass matrix @xmath89 \\ ; %        ( 13)\\ ] ] by using the orthogonal matrix @xmath90 : @xmath91 in this case , three neutrino mass eigenvalues of @xmath42 are @xmath92 , @xmath93 c$ ] and @xmath94 . with the help of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , one may easily arrive at @xmath95 ev and @xmath96 \\approx 3.25 \\times 10^{-2}/\\left ( 2+x^2 \\right ) $ ] .",
    "although the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern is of great interest , it is by no means unique in describing current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "hence we have gone beyond this pattern by allowing for @xmath97 in the above discussions . in both case ( a ) and case ( b ) , the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath90 reads @xmath98 it is obvious that @xmath9 takes the exact tri - bimaximal mixing pattern for @xmath54 .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath55 can be determined from that of @xmath10 through the relationship @xmath99 . in view of @xmath100 , which is obtained from a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data @xcite , we easily arrive at @xmath101 .",
    "we see that the possibility of @xmath102 , which leads @xmath9 to the bimaximal neutrino mixing , has clearly been excluded . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath54 seems to be the simplest and most favored possibility .    within the allowed range of @xmath55 , it is not difficult to find out some viable variations of the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern . in particular ,",
    "we pay interest to such a category of neutrino mixing matrices @xmath9 : the entries of @xmath9 are all formed from small integers and their square roots , which are often suggestive of a certain flavor symmetry in the language of group theories .",
    "below are three examples :    * @xmath103 , corresponding to @xmath104 and @xmath105 * @xmath106 , corresponding to @xmath107 and @xmath108 * @xmath109 , corresponding to @xmath110 and @xmath111    the pattern of @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( 16 ) is especially interesting , because all of its nine elements are formed from four smallest integers @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and their square roots .",
    "this pattern has actually been conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite , but here we illustrate how it can be obtained from @xmath42 .",
    "now let us consider how to derive the neutrino mass matrix @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) or eq . ( 13 ) from a specific seesaw model .",
    "one may naively expect that the minimal seesaw model with two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos @xcite is a good candidate , because it naturally assures that @xmath42 is of rank 2 and has a vanishing mass eigenvalue ( either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) .",
    "taking account of the fact that @xmath42 is composed of two mass matrices @xmath56 and @xmath58 , however , we find that it is more natural to incorporate @xmath42 in the minimal type - ii seesaw model with only one heavy right - handed majorana neutrino @xmath5 in addition to the @xmath6 higgs triplet @xcite . in this case , the neutrino mass term can be written as @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes the column vector of @xmath118 fields , @xmath119 is a @xmath120 matrix arising from the leptonic yukawa interaction induced by the higgs triplet @xmath7 , @xmath121 is a @xmath122 matrix arising from the leptonic yukawa interaction induced by the higgs doublet @xmath123 , and @xmath124 is just the mass of the right - handed majorana neutrino @xmath5 .",
    "provided @xmath125 is considerably higher than the mass scale of @xmath121 , one may obtain the effective ( left - handed ) majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath42 from eq . ( 19 ) via the well - known type - ii seesaw mechanism @xcite : @xmath126 . comparing this formula with @xmath127 , we arrive at @xmath128 the texture of @xmath129 given in eq .",
    "( 5 ) or eq . ( 11 ) may easily be obtained from certain flavor symmetries ( such as the discrete @xmath35-@xmath36 @xcite or @xmath65 @xcite symmetry ) . on the other hand , the texture of @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) can be derived from eq .",
    "( 20 ) with a unique form of @xmath121 , @xmath130 together with @xmath131 .",
    "we remark that such a seesaw realization of the texture of @xmath42 does not involve any parameter fine - tuning or cancellation , and thus it is quite natural .",
    "more interestingly , the minimal type - ii seesaw model under consideration can offer a possibility of understanding the cosmological baryon number asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis @xcite . for simplicity , we assume the mass of @xmath7 is much higher than that of @xmath5 such that the cp - violating asymmetry in the out - of - equilibrium decays of @xmath5 is in practice the only source of leptogenesis .",
    "we allow @xmath55 to be complex in @xmath121 and its imaginary part is just responsible for cp violation in the model . in the @xmath0 case",

    "( 5 ) and @xmath121 in eq . ( 21 ) , implying the absence of cp violation in the decays of @xmath5 .",
    "hence we shall focus our interest on the @xmath1 case in the following .",

    "* note that @xmath192 is a particularly interesting possibility , corresponding to @xmath193 ev , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 gev . in this special case ,",
    "the model is simplified to a unique version which only contains four free parameters and they can all be determined from the experimental values of @xmath88 , @xmath70 , @xmath10 and @xmath44 .",
    "more accurate data will impose much narrower constraints on the model parameters @xmath64 , @xmath72 , @xmath172 and @xmath125 .    finally , it is worthwhile to point out that our neutrino mixing pattern is stable against radiative corrections . running from the seesaw scale @xmath197 down to the electroweak scale @xmath198",

    "in summary , we have proposed a new category of neutrino mass ans@xmath200tze by starting from a combination of two phenomenological observations : ( 1 ) the lightest neutrino mass might be zero or vanishingly small , and ( 2 ) the neutrino mixing matrix might be the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern or a pattern close to it .",
    "we have shown that a realistic neutrino mass matrix @xmath42 can be established either in the limit of @xmath201 and @xmath40 or in the limit of @xmath202 and @xmath1 , corresponding to the possibility of @xmath0 or @xmath1 . in both cases ,",
    "it is possible to introduce a particular perturbation which ensures the resultant neutrino mixing matrix to be the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern or its viable variations with all entries being formed from small integers and their square roots .",
    "we have incorporated the texture of @xmath42 in the minimal type - ii seesaw model with only one heavy right - handed majorana neutrino @xmath5 in addition to the @xmath6 higgs triplet @xmath7 .",

    "<S> current experimental data allow the zero value for one neutrino mass , either @xmath0 or @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation implies that a realistic neutrino mass texture can be established by starting from the limit ( a ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 or ( b ) @xmath4 and @xmath1 . in both cases , we may introduce a particular perturbation which ensures the resultant neutrino mixing matrix to be the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern or its viable variations with all entries being formed from small integers and their square roots . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is natural to incorporate this kind of neutrino mass matrix in the minimal type - ii seesaw model with only one heavy right - handed majorana neutrino @xmath5 in addition to the @xmath6 higgs triplet @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to account for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry in the @xmath1 case via thermal leptogenesis , in which the one - loop vertex correction to @xmath5 decays is mediated by @xmath7 and the cp - violating asymmetry of @xmath5 decays is attributed to the electron flavor . </S>"
