    "for the first time coherence effects in hydrogen - like systems were found by the observation of quantum beats ( stark beats ) in the lyman-@xmath0 transition @xcite . in these experiments only the metastable @xmath5 state of atomic hydrogen",
    "is initially populated .",
    "switching on a constant electric field leads to a build - up of a coherent superposition of the upper @xmath6 and @xmath5 levels , and the radiative decay shows an interference pattern known as quantum beats .",
    "this uncommon behavior of hydrogen - like systems suggests that interesting effects may occur if the lyman-@xmath0 transition is driven by monochromatic laser light and if an additional constant electric field leads to a coherence between the upper levels @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "we show that the resulting photon - counting process is similar to the one predicted by dehmelt @xcite for a different system with two excited states , one rapidly decaying and the other metastable , driven by two lasers .",
    "semiclassically one expects for the dehmelt system periods of constant fluorescence intensity due to the strong transition ( light period ) , interrupted by periods of zero intensity , while the atomic electron is shelved in the metastable state ( dark period ) .",
    "these photon statistics have been observed experimentally @xcite , and the above semiclassical idea has been analyzed quantum mechanically . in an alternative experiment hulet and wineland proved the existence of macroscopic dark periods in the fluorescence intensity of a single ion influenced by a magnetic field , when a single laser is tuned near one of the principal transition resonances @xcite .",
    "hegerfeldt and plenio @xcite proposed another mechanism for dark periods which is not based on the existence of a metastable state .",
    "they studied a three - level atom with two strong electric dipole transitions to one common ground state , driven by a single laser .",
    "the existence of macroscopic dark periods in the fluorescence light is due to a quantum coherence effect .",
    "the premise is a very small energy separation of the upper levels in conjunction with parallel transition dipole moments .",
    "because of this an experimental realization of the latter physical system seems to be difficult @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the photon - counting process of a single hydrogen - like system , driven by a single linearly polarized laser and additionally influenced by a constant electric field . as for the dehmelt system",
    ", there exists a semi classical explanation for the occurrence of macroscopic dark periods in the emission process of the hydrogen - like system as follows . the strong lyman-@xmath0 transition ( @xmath7 ) is driven by the laser light . because of this we expect a constant fluorescence intensity .",
    "the constant electric field leads to the possibility that the atomic electron makes a transition from the @xmath6 to the @xmath5 energy level . in this case",
    "we have zero intensity ( dark period ) , because a dipole transition to the @xmath8 ground state is impossible .",
    "but on the other hand , due to the constant electric field , there exists the possibility that the atomic electron gets out of the @xmath5 back into the @xmath6 energy level , and the emission process starts again . by the quantum mechanical treatment of the problem",
    "we show that under the assumption that the polarization of the laser coincides with the direction of the constant electric field the above semiclassical explanation describes the photon - emission process qualitatively @xcite .    as will be seen later",
    ", one can regulate the mean duration of the dark and light periods almost independently by varying the intensity of the laser beam and the strength of the constant electric field .",
    "the mean duration of the dark periods depends sensitively on the lamb shift @xcite between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 energy level .",
    "a possibly realizable measurement of this mean duration , as it was done in the experiments @xcite in the case of other systems , should give quantitative information about the above energy difference .",
    "we show that there exists a correspondence between this system and the above mentioned mechanism of macroscopic dark periods without a metastable state @xcite .",

    "one finds @xmath147 and for the mean number of photons in a light period we obtain @xmath148 .",

    ", one can regulate the emission process with the aid of the electric fields .",
    "from the calculation above we have seen that macroscopic dark periods occur in hydrogen - like systems like @xmath153 provided the external electric fields are suitably chosen .",
    "one might wonder , however , in which way one can reach a dark period .",
    "as the quantum mechanical calculation shows and the intuitive explanation in the introduction suggests , in order to reach a macroscopic dark period the system must be mostly in the @xmath5 state .",
    "one might be tempted to argue in a simplified way as follows .",
    "one could assume that the coherent evolution of the atom is started by the absorption of a @xmath154 photon , and terminated by spontaneous emission into this channel . in order to evolve to an extended dark period spontaneous emission must not occur for many lifetimes .",
    "if we take the effective rabi frequency @xmath155 of the stark field one would estimate that the probability to obtain an even mixing of @xmath6 and @xmath5 is smaller than @xmath156 , or @xmath157 , and at this point the atom is not dark at all . from the @xmath149 lifetime of the @xmath6 state of @xmath153 one",
    "estimates a lower limit of @xmath158 for the mean time of a light period in the emission process .",
    "this result much exceeds the previously calculated value of @xmath159 from the quantum mechanical description , and macroscopic dark periods should be very seldom .    at this point",
    "we have to remember that it is the relative weight of the @xmath5 state in the emission - free subensemble that counts rather than the absolute population .",
    "there are _ two _ mechanisms that make the @xmath5 state become rapidly predominant in the emission - free subensemble as follows .",
    "the relative weight of the @xmath6 and the @xmath8 state in the emission - free subensemble decreases rapidly on the time scale @xmath115 , because those atoms with a spontaneous emission from the strong lyman-@xmath0 transition leave the emission - free subensemble and do not contribute .",
    "on the other hand the @xmath5 state is metastable and weakly coupled to the @xmath6 state .",
    "therefore if the atom is once in the @xmath5 state it stays with a high probability , and it remains in the emission - free subensemble for a long time . as a conclusion",
    "we obtain the possibly astonishing result that the @xmath5 state becomes predominant fairly quickly in the emission - free subensemble although the absolute population of this metastable state is very small .",
    "an estimation of the population dynamics in the emission - free subensemble from a very simple rate equation model is given in the appendix .",
    "for the mechanism of quantum jumps in hydrogen - like systems there exists a close relation to the proposal of macroscopic dark periods without a metastable state by hegerfeldt and plenio @xcite as follows .",
    "if we neglect the existence of the weakly coupled @xmath92 level , and if we consider the conditional hamiltonian , which is given in matrix form with respect to the atomic orthonormal basis @xmath14 , @xmath160 then eq . ( [ dressed states formulierung ] ) corresponds directly to eq .",
