    "the phenomenon of _ stochastic resonance _ ( sr ) namely , the _ enhancement _ of the output signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) caused by injection of an optimal amount of noise into a nonlinear system configures a counterintuitive cooperative effect arising from the interplay between _ deterministic _ and _ random _ dynamics in a _ nonlinear _ system .",
    "the broad range of phenomena for which this mechanism can offer an explanation can be appreciated in ref.@xcite and references therein , where we can scan the state of the art .",
    "most of the phenomena that could possibly be described within a sr framework occur in _ extended _ systems : for example , diverse experiments were carried out to explore the role of sr in sensory and other biological functions @xcite or in chemical systems @xcite .",
    "these were , together with the possible technological applications , the main motivation to many recent studies showing the possibility of achieving an enhancement of the system response by means of the coupling of several units in what conforms an _ extended medium _",
    "@xcite , or analyzing the possibility of making the system response less dependent on a fine tuning of the noise intensity , as well as different ways to control the phenomenon @xcite .    in previous papers @xcite",
    "we have studied the stochastic resonant phenomenon in extended systems for the transition between two different patterns , exploiting the concept of _ nonequilibrium potential _ ( nep ) @xcite .",
    "this potential is a special lyapunov functional of the associated deterministic system which for nonequilibrium systems plays a role similar to that played by a thermodynamic potential in equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "such a nonequilibrium potential , closely related to the solution of the time independent fokker - planck equation of the system , characterizes the global properties of the dynamics : that is attractors , relative ( or nonlinear ) stability of these attractors , height of the barriers separating attraction basins , and in addition it allows us to evaluate the transition rates among the different attractors @xcite . in another recent paper",
    "we have explored the characteristics of this sr phenomenon in an extended system composed by an ensemble of noise - induced nonlinear oscillators coupled by a nonhomogeneous , density dependent diffusion , externally forced and perturbed by a multiplicative noise , that shows an effective noise induced bistable dynamics @xcite .",
    "the stochastic resonance between the attractors of the noise - induced dynamics was theoretically investigated in terms of a two - state approximation .",
    "it was shown that the knowledge of the exact nep allowed us to completely analyzed the behavior of the output snr .",
    "recent studies on biological models of the hodgkin - huxley type @xcite have shown that ion concentrations along biological cell membranes present intrinsic sr - like phenomena as the number of ion channels is varied .",
    "a related result @xcite shows that even in the absence of external forcing , the regularity of the collective firing of a set of coupled excitable fitzhugh - nagumo units results optimal for a given value of the number of elements . from a physical system point of view ,",
    "the same phenomenon that has been called _ system size stochastic resonance _ ( sssr) has also been found in an ising model as well as in a set of globally coupled units described by a @xmath0 theory @xcite .",
    "it was even shown to arise in opinion formation models @xcite .",
    "the sssr phenomenon occurs in extended systems , hence it is clearly of great interest to describe this phenomenon within the nep framework .",
    "more , the nep offers a general framework for the study of the dependence of resonant and other related phenomena on any of system s parameters .",
    "with such a goal in mind , in a recent paper @xcite it was shown that sssr could be analyzed within a nep framework and that , depending on the system , its origin could be essentially traced back to a breaking of the symmetry of such a potential .",
    "even those cases discussed in @xcite could be described within this same framework , and the (  effective \" ) scaling of the noise with the system s size could be clearly seen . here ,",
    "we discuss in more detail the cases analyzed in @xcite and present a new interesting one , corresponding to the study of sssr in a system that also shows noise induced patterns , the same one studied in @xcite .",
    "we show that in two of the cases corresponding to pattern forming systems that include only local interactions the problem could be rewritten in such a way as to present a kind of  entrainment \" between the symmetry breaking of an  effective \" potential together with a scaling of the noise intensity with the system size .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ model1 ]",
    "we focus on a simple reaction - diffusion model with a known form of the nep , that presents sssr associated to a nep s symmetry breaking . in section [ model2 ]",
    "we analyze the model of globally coupled nonlinear oscillators discussed in @xcite , and show that it can also be described within the nep framework , with sssr arising due to a deepening of the potential wells , or through an  effective \" scaling of the noise intensity with the system size .",
    "we start section [ model3 ] by briefly reviewing the model and the formalism to be used for the case of multiplicative noise . in this case , by scaling the nep with the system size , we show that the system s behavior could be associated to a kind of  entrainment \" between the symmetry breaking of an  effective \" potential and a scaling of the noise intensity with the system size",
    ". finally , we present in section [ conc ] some conclusions and perspectives .",
    "the specific model we shall focus on in this section , with a known form of the nep , corresponds to a one  dimensional , one  component model @xcite that , with a piecewise linear form for the reaction term , mimics general bistable reaction ",
    "diffusion models @xcite , that is with a cubic like nonlinear reaction term . in particular we will exploit some of the results on the influence of general boundary conditions ( called _ albedo _ ) found in @xcite as well as previous studies of the nep @xcite and of sr @xcite .",
    "the particular non - dimensional form of the model that we work with is @xcite @xmath1 we consider here a class of stationary structures @xmath2 in the bounded domain @xmath3 $ ] with albedo boundary conditions at both ends , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the albedo parameter .",

    ", there are two stationary solutions , given by the two values of @xmath13 .",
    "figure 5 in @xcite , that we do not reproduce here , depicts the curves corresponding to the relation @xmath22 vs. @xmath23 , for various values of @xmath24 .    through a linear stability analysis",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the structure with the smallest `` excited '' region ( with @xmath25 , denoted by @xmath26 ) is unstable , whereas the other one ( with @xmath27 , denoted by @xmath28 ) is linearly stable .",
    "the trivial homogeneous solution @xmath29 ( denoted by @xmath30 ) exists for any parameter set and is always linearly stable .",
    "these two linearly stable solutions are the only stable stationary structures under the given albedo boundary conditions .",
    "we will concentrate on the region of values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath23 , where both nonhomogeneous structures exist .    for the system with the albedo b.c .",

    "the behavior shown in this figure is analogous to the one observed in fig .",

    "we see that for small @xmath32 , small size effects increase the nep values of the nonhomogeneous structures , and the uniform state results to be the most stable one .",
    "it becomes metastable at @xmath184 , and nonuniform patterns are the globally stable attractors for larger values of @xmath32 .",
    "the rate transitions also reflect this fact ( they are decreasing functions of @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , we expect that @xmath181 which depends on the system size , increases with @xmath32 , and due to the interplay of the rates and the behavior of @xmath181 , a sssr can be expected .",

    "note the global stabilization of the nontrivial stable pattern for high values of @xmath32.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] [ figpot ]    . as indicated in the text , we fixed @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath156 , and @xmath187.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] [ figsssr ]    we can make the following interpretation in terms of @xmath188 , the  effective \" nep ( the scaled form of the nep , eq . ( [ vefectivo ] ) ) , and the the scaling of the noise intensity . in fig .",
    "9 we depict the form of @xmath188 as function of @xmath32 .",
    "it is clear that , even though it is weak , the dependance of @xmath188 with @xmath32 still shows the change in the relative stability of the attractors , while we have the scaling of the noise intensity with @xmath32 .",

    "the study of sr in extended or coupled systems , motivated by both , some experimental results and the growing technological interest , has recently attracted considerable attention @xcite . in previous papers @xcite",
    "we have studied the sr phenomenon for the transition between two different patterns , exploiting the concept of _ nonequilibrium potential _ @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite have shown that several systems presents intrinsic sr - like phenomena as the number of units , or the size of the system is varied .",
    "this phenomenon , called _ system size stochastic resonance _ , has also been found in a set of globally coupled units described by a @xmath0 theory @xcite , and even shown to arise in opinion formation models @xcite .",
    "such sssr phenomenon occurs in extended systems , hence it was clearly of great interest to have a description of this phenomenon within the nep framework .    here",
    ", we have discussed in detail two of the cases analyzed in @xcite and presented a third , interesting one , that corresponds to the study of the system size dependence of sr in the same system studied in @xcite .",
    "a relevant aspect that arose from these studies is that there is a kind of entrainment between the symmetry breaking of the nep as described in @xcite , together with a scaling of noise intensity with system size as in @xcite .    in the first case we focused on a simple reaction - diffusion model with a known form of the nep @xcite , and as in all three cases considering the adiabatic limit and exploiting the two - state approximation",
    ", we were able to clearly quantify the system size dependence of the snr .",
    "we have shown that in this case , sssr is associated to a nep s symmetry breaking .",
    "for the second case we analyzed the model of globally coupled nonlinear oscillators discussed in @xcite , and have shown that it can also be described within the nep framework , but now sssr arises through an  effective \" scaling of the noise intensity with the system size . for the third",
    "studied case , we have obtained the exact form of the noise - induced patterns ( both the stable and unstable ones ) as well as the analytical expression of the nep .",
    "the interplay of the transition rates , that are essentially decreasing functions of @xmath32 , and the behavior of @xmath181 , that increases with @xmath32 , explain the existence of a maximum in the snr for a specific length of the system and a fixed noise intensity .",
    "what arose here , through an alternative form of analysis , is that there is a kind of entrainment between the symmetry breaking of the nep as described in @xcite , together with a scaling of noise intensity with the system size as in @xcite .",
    "the results found in this work clearly show that the  nonequilibrium potential \" ( even if not known in detail , see for instance @xcite ) offers a very useful framework to analyze a wide spectrum of characteristics associated to sr in spatially extended or coupled systems . within this framework",
    "the phenomenon of sssr looks , as other aspects of sr in extended systems @xcite , as a natural consequence of a breaking of the symmetry of the nep or to an effective scaling of the noise intensity as in @xcite , or could be interpreted as an entrainment between the two aspects .",
    "in addition , in the first studied case , we have seen a new form of resonant behavior through the variation of the coupling with the surroundings .",
    "in such a case the system s response to an external signal becomes more _ robust _ , that is _ less sensitive _ to the precise value of the albedo parameter .",
    "this fact opens new possibilities for analyzing and interpreting the behavior of some biological systems @xcite .    as a final comment",
    ", the main difference between the first and third cases when compared with the second one , is that in the two former cases we have local interactions with albedo b.c .",
    "( covering the range from neumann to dirichlet b.c . ) , while the latter has a non local coupling together with boundary conditions that could be assumed as neumann . from our results , it is possible to argue that the effective scaling of the noise that arises in the second case comes from the non local interaction , and not from the b.c . to make this aspect more obvious",
    ", we plan to study , within the present framework , the competence between local and non - local spatial couplings @xcite , that arise in some multi - component models .",
    "also , the consideration of more general systems with several components will allow us to analyze the system size dependence of sr between patterns in general activator - inhibitor - like systems .",
    "all these aspects will be the subject of further work .",
