    "the study of hadronic electromagnetic form factors at low momentum transfer provides important insight into the non - perturbative structure of qcd .",
    "a model - independent tool to study qcd at low energies is chiral perturbation theory ( ) , which is an effective field theory with low - energy degrees of freedom , e.g. , the meson octet in @xmath0 flavor or the pion triplet in the case of @xmath1 flavor .",
    "assumes that these mesons are the pseudo - goldstone bosons that appear from spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry from @xmath2 down to @xmath3 .",
    "observables receive contributions from both long - range and short range physics ; in  the long - range contribution arises from the ( non - analytic ) structure of pion loop contributions , while the short - range contribution is encoded in a number of low - energy constants that appear in the chiral lagrangian and are unconstrained in .",
    "these low - energy constants must be determined from experiment or lattice simulations .",
    "notable progress toward measuring the proton and neutron form factors has been made in recent years and high precision data are available ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "experimental study of the remaining octet baryons , however , is much harder .",
    "the charge radius of the @xmath4 has only recently been measured  @xcite .",
    "although more experimental data for the other baryon electromagnetic observables can be expected in the future , progress will be slow as the experimental difficulties are significant .",
    "theory , however , may have a chance to catch up . while quenched lattice calculations have already appeared  @xcite , with the advance of lattice gauge theory , we expect partially quenched calculations for many of these observables in the near future .",
    "one problem that currently and foreseeably plagues these lattice calculations is that they can not be performed with the physical masses of the light quarks .",
    "therefore , to make physical predictions , it is necessary to extrapolate from the heavier quark masses used on the lattice ( currently on the order of the strange quark mass ) down to the physical light quark masses . for lattice calculations that use",
    "the quenched approximation of qcd ( qqcd ) , where the fermion determinant that arises from the path integral is set to one , quenched chiral perturbation theory ( )  @xcite has been developed to aid in the extrapolation .",
    "the problem with the quenched approximation is that the goldstone boson singlet is no longer affected by the @xmath5 anomaly as in qcd . in other words ,",
    "the qqcd equivalent of the @xmath6 that is heavy in qcd remains light and must be included in the  lagrangian .",
    "this requires the addition of new operators and hence new low - energy constants . in general , the low - energy constants appearing in the lagrangian are unrelated to those in  and extrapolated quenched lattice data is unrelated to qcd .",
    "in fact , several examples show that the behavior of meson loops near the chiral limit is frequently misrepresented in  @xcite .",
    "we find this is additionally true for the meson and baryon charge radii .",
    "these problems can be remedied by using partially quenched lattice qcd ( pqqcd ) . unlike qqcd , where the masses of quarks not connected to external sources are set to infinity , these `` sea quark",
    "'' masses are kept finite in pqqcd .",
    "the masses of the sea quarks can be varied independently of the valence quark masses ; usually they are chosen to be heavier .",
    "sea quarks are thereby kept as dynamical degrees of freedom and the fermion determinant is no longer equal to one . by efficaciously giving the sea quarks larger masses it is much less costly to calculate observables than in ordinary qcd .",
    "the low - energy effective theory of pqqcd is  @xcite .",
    "since pqqcd retains a @xmath5 anomaly , the equivalent to the singlet field in qcd is heavy ( on the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath7 ) and can be integrated out  @xcite . therefore , the low - energy constants appearing in  are the same as those appearing in . by fitting  to partially quenched lattice data",
    "one can determine these constants and actually make physical predictions for qcd",
    ".  has been used recently to study heavy meson  @xcite and octet baryon observables  @xcite .",
    "while there are a number of lattice calculations for observables such as the pion form factor  @xcite or the octet baryon magnetic moments  @xcite that use the quenched approximation , there are currently no partially quenched simulations .",
    "however , given the recent progress that lattice gauge theory has made in the one - hadron sector and the prospect of simulations in the two - hadron sector  @xcite , we expect to see partially quenched calculations of the electromagnetic form factors in the near future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : pqcpt ] , we review  including the treatment of the baryon octet and decuplet in the heavy baryon approximation . in section  [ sec : ff ] , we calculate the charge radii of the meson and baryon octets in both  and up to next - to - leading ( nlo ) order in the chiral expansion .",
    "we use the heavy baryon formalism of jenkins and manohar  @xcite , treat the decuplet baryons as dynamical degrees of freedom , and keep contributions to lowest order in the heavy baryon mass , @xmath8 .",
    "these calculations are done in the isospin limit of @xmath0 flavor . for completeness",
    "we also provide the   result for the charge radii for the @xmath1 chiral lagrangian with non - degenerate quarks in the appendix . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "in pqqcd the quark part of the lagrangian is written as  @xcite @xmath9 here , in addition to the fermionic light valence quarks @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and their bosonic counterparts @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , three light fermionic sea quarks @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 have been added .",
    "these nine quarks are in the fundamental representation of the graded group @xmath19  @xcite and have been accommodated in the nine - component vector @xmath20 that obeys the graded equal - time commutation relation @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are spin and @xmath24 and @xmath16 are flavor indices .",
    "the graded equal - time commutation relations for two @xmath25 s and two @xmath26 s can be written analogously .",
    "the grading factor @xmath27 takes into account the different statistics for fermionic and bosonic quarks .",
    "the quark mass matrix is given by @xmath28 so that diagrams with closed ghost quark loops cancel those with valence quarks .",

    "it has been recently realized  @xcite that the light quark electric charge matrix @xmath32 is not uniquely defined in pqqcd .",
    "the only constraint one imposes is for the charge matrix @xmath32 to have vanishing supertrace .",
    "thus as in qcd , no new operators involving the singlet component are subsequently introduced . following  @xcite we use @xmath33 so that qcd is recovered in the limit @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 independently of the @xmath37 s .      for massless quarks , the lagrangian in eq .",
