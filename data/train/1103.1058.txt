    "in the concordance @xmath11cdm universe , the baryonic gas ( igm ) traces the collisionless cold dark matter in the linear regime of gravitational clustering .",
    "however , observation shows that these two components do not related to each other by a linear mapping on scales up to a few mpc .",
    "most attention on the reason of the igm - cold dark matter separation on such scales has been drawn to the thermal property of baryonic gas , mainly radiative heating and cooling , such as photo - heating , feedbacks from star formation and accretion to black holes ( e.g. , valageas & silk 1999 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ; voit et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang & pen 2003 ; xue & wu 2003 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical origin of the igm - dark matter separation has been noticed in the early studies of large scale structure formation ( shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ) .",
    "successive studies found that in the weak and moderate nonlinear regime of clustering , the evolution of collisionless particle can be described by the zeldovich approximation , while the dynamics of baryonic component is sketched by the adhesion approximation with dissipation of kinetic energy , or by a random force driving burgers equation ( gurbatov , saichev , & shandarin 1989 ; berera & fang 1994 ; vergassola et al .",
    "1994 ; jones 1999 ; matarrese & mohayaee 2002 ; pando , feng , & fang 2004 ) . when the reynolds number is large , burgers fluid will be turbulent , consisting of shocks ( lssig 2000 ) . burgers shocks occur not only in high , but also in middle and even low density regions .",
    "these shocks could contribute partly to the deviation of the velocity and density fields of the igm from that of cold dark matter ( pando et al 2004 ; kim et al 2005 ) .",
    "a new progress shows that in the highly developed nonlinear regime the velocity field of the igm is no longer potential , but dominated by vorticity on scales from one and a half hundred kpc to a couple of mpc ( zhu , feng & fang 2010 ) .",
    "oblique shocks will form in inhomogeneous baryonic fluid and act as the source of vorticity of the igm .",
    "these results give supports to the scenario that in the nonlinear regime the baryonic fluid is in the state of fully developed turbulence , which can be characterized by the she - leveque ( sl ) scaling ( he et al .",
    "2006 ) and the log - poisson hierarchy ( liu & fang 2008 ) .",
    "although tiny vorticity can also be generated in dark matter field during shell crossing , the velocity field of dark matter is still dominated by potential motion on scales around @xmath12 mpc ( pichon & bernardeau 1999 ; pueblas & scoccimarro 2008 ) .",
    "consequently , the velocity and density fields of the igm would depart from those of underlying collisionless dark matter on scales below a few mpc .",
    "some features predicted from the fully developed turbulence have been found to be consistent with observation , such as the log - poisson non - gaussianity of ly@xmath13 transmitted flux of quasar s absorption spectrum ( lu , chu , & fang 2009 ; lu et al .",
    "2010 ) , the scaling relations among the x - ray luminosity , temperature and sz effect of clusters ( zhang et al 2006 ; yuan et al . 2009 ) and the turbulence broadening of hi and heii ly@xmath13 absorption lines ( zheng et al . 2004",
    "; liu et al . 2006 ) .    in this paper , we extend these studies to the baryon fraction @xmath9 , which is defined as the mass ratio between the baryonic and total matter in a system . in the concordance @xmath11cdm universe ,",
    "the cosmic mean of baryon fraction is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mean mass density parameters of the baryonic matter and total matter respectively ( dunkley et al .",
    "2009 ; komatsu et al .",
    "the baryon fraction in gravitational bound objects is found to be lower than the cosmic mean , known as the missing baryon problem . for galaxy clusters and groups ,",
    "the baryon fraction is smaller than the cosmic mean by a factor of 2 - 4 ( ettori 2003 ; giodini et al . 2009 ; dai et al .",
    "2010 ) , while can be as low as about @xmath17 of the cosmic mean for dwarf galaxies(mcgaugh et al .",
    "generally , the baryon fraction decreases monotonically with decreasing mass of collapsed halos .",
    "this problem has also been seen in the study of galaxies abundance .",
    "the @xmath11cdm model predicts too many low mass dark matter halos in comparison with estimation from the observed luminosity function of galaxies .",
    "it implies that the star formation rate in low mass dark matter halos is substantially low .",
    "the baryon content residing in virialized objects with small mass should be much less than that given by the cosmic mean .",
    "additional physics are needed to keep the baryonic matter from overcooling ( white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "many kinds of mechanisms have been proposed to prevent most of the baryon falling into dark matter halos .",
    "feedback from supernovae and agn and photo - heating are well investigated .",
    "feedback from massive stars and sne were once believed to be able to driving out the collapsed gaseous baryon and hence suppress the star formation(dekel & silk 1986 ; white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "theoretically , simulations and observations have shown that this mechanism is unlike to work while taking appropriate feedback efficiency , mass loss rate(e.g .",
    "mac low & ferrara 1999 ; benson et al .",
    "2003 ) , except for low mass halos .",
    "in contrast , mechanisms in which the missing baryon are inhibited to fall into the protogalactic halos in the very beginning , i.e. , never fell into , are much preferred ( mo et al .",
    "2005 ; anderson & bregman 2010 ) .",
    "photo - heating fulfills this category which adopt a photo - ionizing field to reheat the baryon around progalactic halos and hence keep them from collapse into potential wells(e.g .",
    "efstathiou 1992 ; gnedin 2000 ; benson 2002 ) .",
    "the efficiency of this model , however , was later found to be largely limited , only works for halos below @xmath18 m@xmath19 ( hoeft et al .",
    "2006 ) , because the central self - shielding will delay the photo - evaporation .    in our view , igm turbulence should be an important reason of the missing baryon problem .",
    "the effects of turbulence on the properties of clusters have been extensively studied by numerical simulations and theoretical works(e.g .",
    "norman & bryan 1999 ; dolag et al .",
    "2005 ; vazza et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; burns , skillman & oshea 2010 ; ruszkowski & oh 2010 ) .",
    "yet , we will focus on the dynamical and statistical effect of turbulence on the spatial distribution of baryon fraction .",
    "that is , the turbulence of igm is treated as a basic environment factor of gravitational clustering .",
    "the baryon missing in virialized objects should be a result of the formation and evolution of inhomogeneity of @xmath0 spatial distribution .",
    "one can then explain the baryon missing by considering the inhibition of gravitational collapse by turbulence pressure ( chandrasekhar 1951a , 1951b ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 addresses the theoretic background of turbulence in the igm and its effect on the gravitational collapsing of baryonic matter .  3",
    "gives the simulation method of producing samples . in ",
    "4 , we study the properties of the non - uniform distribution of the baryon fraction , and its relation with turbulence . ",
    "5 presents the baryon fraction in collapsed halos .",
    "we discuss our results and compare them with previous numerical studies in  6 .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in  7 .",
    "hierarchical structure formation process will introduce shocks(ryu et al . 2003 ; pfrommer et al . 2006 ; vazza et al .",
    "the shock wakes and shear flows , arose from gas accreting into pancakes , filaments and halos , protogalactic and collapsed objects moving in complex structures and gaseous structure colliding and merging , will interplay with each other and drive instability , result in the onset of turbulence .",
    "fully developed turbulence consists of eddies on various scales and will cascade the kinetic energy of largest eddies down to smaller one ( lin 1966 ; shu 1992 ) .    more specifically , the evolution of baryonic fluid in the moderate nonlinear regime can be characterized by random force driving burgers equation ( gurbatov et al .",
    "1989 ; berera & fang , 1994 ; jones , 1999 ; matarrese & mohayaee , 2002 ) . when the effective reynolds number is large , burgers fluid will be turbulent , consisting of shocks and complex structures on various scales(polyakov , 1995",
    "; lssig 2000 ; boldyrev et al .",
    "2004 ) . as dark matter",
    "is not influenced by burgers turbulence , the igm velocity field will dynamically decouple from the dark matter field on scales larger than the jeans length once burgers turbulence is developed .",
    "this will lead to the deviation of @xmath0 from @xmath20 in low and high density areas .",
    "the velocity field of baryonic fluid keeps irrotational in the moderate nonlinear regime .",
    "latter on , the velocity field of igm will no longer be potential dominated , because the vorticity can be effectively generated by oblique shocks due to baroclinic instability(zhu et al 2010 ) .",
    "when shocks propagate in inhomogeneous medium , they will generally evolve into oblique or curved shock waves ( e.g. landau & lifshitz 1987 ) , acting as the source of vorticity ( e.g. picone et al . 1984 ; emanuel 2000 ) .",
    "once triggered , the vorticity can be self - amplified by the nonlinearity of hydrodynamics ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "finally the igm evolves into a fully developed turbulent state which satisfies the she - leveque scaling and log - poisson hierarchy ( he et al .",
    "2006 ; liu & fang 2008 ; lu et al 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "more details about the development of turbulence in the igm along cosmit evolution can be found in ( zhu et al .",
    "2010 ; fang & zhu 2011 ) .",
    "the jeans length of self - gravitational clustering in a statistical uniform gas with density @xmath21 and speed of sound @xmath22 with or without turbulent gas motion has been studied by chandrasekhar ( 1951a , 1951b ) . in the absence of turbulence ,",
    "the jeans length is @xmath23 , i.e. gravitational clustering can occur only if the perturbation scale is larger than @xmath24 .",
    "the effect of turbulent motions on the clustering is to replace @xmath22 by an effective sound speed @xmath25 where @xmath26 measures the velocity fluctuations of turbulence .",
    "the jeans length is increased by the random velocity field of turbulence , which plays the similar role as the randomly thermal motion .",
    "the random motion of the turbulence provides an extra pressure , @xmath27 , called turbulence pressure .",
    "the turbulence pressure , joining the thermal pressure , will slow down and even halt the igm falling into a gravitational well .    considering the gravitational collapsing on scale @xmath28",
    "will not be affected by the velocity dispersion on scales that larger than @xmath28 , the velocity fluctuations with wave - numbers @xmath29 will not resist gravitational collapsing on scales larger than @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , the effect of turbulence pressure on gravitational collapsing on scale @xmath28 could be estimated by ( bonazzola et al 1987 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the power spectrum of kinetic energy density @xmath32 of the turbulence .",
    "the upper limit of the integral eq.(2 ) @xmath33 corresponds to the minimal scale @xmath34 below which the turbulence is dissipated .",
    "the lower limit of the integral eq.(2 ) is the maximum of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath36 matches the upper scale of turbulence . obviously , the turbulent pressure @xmath38 is dynamical , not thermal",
    ". it can be comparable to the thermal pressure of the igm , especially in regions the temperature of igm is not very high .    when we estimate the turbulence pressure with eq.(1 ) or ( 2 ) , we should separate the velocity field @xmath39 into two components : one is the random motion of turbulence and the other is the bulk velocity .",
    "the latter mainly depends on the gravitational potential , and does not contribute to the turbulence pressure . in some algorithms ,",
    "the bulk velocity is identified as the mean velocity within a box , while the fluctuation with respect to the mean velocity is supposed to be the turbulent motion . as the box size is selected by hand",
    ", these algorithms might contain non - ignorable system bias . a better way to pick up the random motion of turbulence bases on the vorticity of velocity field .",
    "the vorticity field @xmath40 of the velocity field @xmath41 of the igm is defined by @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "the dynamical equation of the vorticity @xmath45 is ( zhu et al .",
    "2010 ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the pressure of the igm , @xmath48 is the divergence of the velocity field and @xmath49 is the cosmic factor .",
    "tensor @xmath50 , defined as @xmath51 , is called strain rate , and @xmath52_i = s_{ij}\\omega_j$ ] . a remarkable property of eq.(3 ) is the absence of the gravity term .",
    "this point is expected , as gravity is curl - free in nature .",
    "in other words , vorticity is fully given by the nonlinearity of hydrodynamics and hence is effective to measure the turbulence .",
    "an important property of the vorticity is that for a fully developed turbulence the power spectra of the vorticity field @xmath53 and the velocity field @xmath54 should satisfy @xmath55 ( batchelor 1959 , 2000 ) .",
    "this relation can be used to determine the wavenumber @xmath36 , i.e. the upper scale of fully developed turbulence .",
    "we use this criterion to ascertain @xmath36 to calculate the integral eq.(2 ) .",
    "the dynamical effect of turbulence on the gravitational clustering of the igm can be seen with the time evolution of the irrotational component of velocity field , i.e. the divergence of velocity field @xmath48 , which follows ( zhu et al 2010 ) @xmath56,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the total mass density including both cold dark and baryonic matter with @xmath58 being its mean value .",
    "as negative divergence means the increase of density , positive @xmath59 will lead to clustering , while negative one result in anti - clustering .",
    "the right hand side of eq.(4 ) can be used to compare the effects of hydrodynamical terms on clustering with that of gravity .",
    "we first identify the physical meaning of the hydrodynamical terms on the right hand sight of eq.(4 ) by considering incompressible fluid , i.e. assuming @xmath57 to be a constant @xmath60 . in this case , the term of gravity @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the continuity equation yields @xmath63 , and eq.(4 ) gives @xmath64 this is a typical poisson equation for the scalar field @xmath47 .",
    "analogous to the field equations in electrostatics , the term @xmath65 $ ] on the right hand side of eq.(5 ) plays the role of the  charge `` of a pressure field . positive ",
    "charge '' produces an attraction force , while negative  charge `` yields a repulsive force . back to eq.(4 ) , @xmath66 $ ] also plays the role of nonthermal pressure of turbulence . in regions with negative  charge '' , i.e. @xmath67 < 0 $ ] , the turbulent fluid will prevent the gravitational clustering .",
    "the sign of the  charge `` is actually determined by the levels that turbulence has developed . from the definition of vorticity and strain rate",
    ", we have @xmath68.\\ ] ] for a gaussian velocity field , @xmath69 , the net effect of velocity fluctuations on the igm collapsing is null in average .",
    "however , for a non - gaussian velocity field , it can be either positive or negative , depending on the property of the velocity field . for a homogeneous and isotropic turbulence , @xmath70 ( batchelor 1959 ) ,",
    "the sign of the  charge '' , @xmath71 $ ] , is always negative .",
    "a fully developed turbulent flow will generally prevent the igm from gravitational collapsing .",
    "the term @xmath72 of eq.(4 ) relates to the hydrostatic pressure while does not consider fluid compressibility , which has been presented in eq.(5 ) .",
    "it is mostly negative in overdense collapsing regions , and will resist upon gravitational collapse .",
    "the term @xmath73 on the right hand side of eq.(4 ) result from the compressibility of the igm",
    ". its value would be negative when the density - pressure relation is a power law @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and then also plays the role of resisting gravitational collapsing .",
    "the physical meaning of the term @xmath76 can be shown by the ratio between @xmath77 and the gravity term @xmath78 .",
    "the ratio is roughly equal to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the free falling time scale , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , is the dynamical time scale on a spatial scale @xmath28 collapsing .",
    "when @xmath83 is larger than @xmath84 , the free falling time scale is larger than the dynamical time scale , and in result , the collapsing on scale @xmath28 is significantly prevented .",
    "as mentioned above , the turbulent igm contains curved shocks , vortices , and other discontinuities . to study the effect of turbulent igm with simulation",
    ", the algorithm should be qualify for capturing these complex structures .",
    "we take advantage of the development of the weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) method ( shu 1999 ) .",
    "the weno schemes have been widely used in various fields , such as high reynolds number compressible flows ( zhang et al .",
    "2003 ) , high mach number jets ( carrillo et al . 2003 ) , magneto - hydrodynamics ( jiang & wu , 1999 ) and hypersonic boundary layer ( rehman et al 2009 ) . the shock capturing algorithm with weno scheme has past many test , including shock - boundary layer interaction ( lagha et al . 2009 ) , shocks in high - speed flows ( martin , piomelli & candler 2000 ) , shock vortex interaction ( grasso & pirzzoli 2000a , 2000b ) and shock - turbulence interaction ( pirozzoll 2002 ) .",
    "an updated review of the weno method is given in shu 2009 .",
    "in the context of cosmological hydrodynamical simulation , the wigeon code is based on eulerian description of hydrodynamics with 5th order weno finite difference scheme and particle mesh ( pm ) method for dark matter particles ( feng , shu , & zhang 2004 ) .",
    "the wigeon code can reproduce commonly accepted results such as the relation between igm temperature and density and the component of whim ( he , feng , & fang 2004 ) . in the same time , it also reveals a series of turbulent behavior of the igm ( he at al 2006 ; liu & fang 2008 ; lu et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "these features of this code fit well with our goal .",
    "the cosmological parameters are taken to be @xmath85 ( 0.274 , 0.726 , 0.705 , 0.812 , 0.0456 , 0.96 , 11.0 ) ( komatsu et al . , 2009 ) .",

    "we assign the mass of dark matter particles onto grids using the triangle - shaped - cloud ( tsc ) method . in order to minimize the system bias of assignment in calculating the baryon fraction on grids , we smooth over the density fields of baryonic and dark matter on grids separately using the same smooth window with radius of one grid .",
    "to identify halos of dark matter and their radius @xmath94 , we use the same process as crain et al .",
    "halos are identified by two methods : a. ) friends - of - friends ( fof ) method with a linking length parameter @xmath95 ; b. ) hop method ( eisenstein & hut 1998 ) with default parameters for group searching and @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for group merging .",

    "the distribution of vorticity also does nt always follow the filament and sheet structures of the matter density fields , but has cloud - like structures ( zhu et al 2010 ) .",
    "although curved shocks are the sources of vorticity , the spatial distribution of vorticity field does not show the same configuration as the shocks .",
    "it is because the spatial transfer of vorticity is given by the velocity field [ eq.(3 ) ] , while the case with shock front is different .",
    "once the vorticity appears , it will depart from their source - curved shocks and spreads over the space along with the velocity field ( batchelor 2000 ) .    in the plot of vorticity distribution ,",

    "the spatial distribution of the normalized baryon fraction @xmath110 is highly non - uniform .",
    "the value of @xmath110 spreads over three orders of magnitude from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , indicating that the separation of baryonic matter from dark matter is significant developed during the nonlinear evolution .",
    "the deviation of baryon fraction from the cosmic mean is not only occurred in or around massive halos , but also in the low and moderate density areas .",

    "the first three terms on the right hand side of eq.(4 ) describe the gas dynamical and thermal effects , namely , the vorticity and strain rate @xmath120 , the ordinary pressure @xmath72 and multiphase - related term @xmath121 .",

    "( 2010 ) .      as vorticity is an important dynamical factor to cause a low baryon fraction",

    "the event of @xmath116 baryon missing can occur even in the regions out of collapsed clumps , indicating that the baryon missing of virialized halos should be considered as result of the evolution of baryon distribution on sizes larger than virialized halos .",
    "it has been shown that the relation @xmath55 is well satisfied by the igm velocity field in the scale range from 0.2 to 3 @xmath86 mpc at @xmath99 ( zhu et al 2010 ) , on which the igm is in the state of fully developed homogeneous and isotropic turbulence .",
    "the power spectrum of kinetic energy density of the turbulence is approximately @xmath151 . the turbulence pressure ( or the kinetic energy density )",

    "the mass of halos with @xmath159 k is about @xmath2 @xmath86 @xmath160 .",

    "the baryon fraction would significantly be reduced for halos with mass @xmath161 @xmath86 @xmath160",
    ".    meanwhile , the kinetic energy density of turbulence is small than that of the virial motion of halos with mass larger than times of @xmath2 @xmath86 @xmath160 .",
    "thus , the halo mass dependence of the baryon massing would show two phases : when the halo mass is larger than times of @xmath2 @xmath86 @xmath160 , the baryon fraction @xmath0 is not much affected by turbulent igm , and it will be substantially decreasing with halo mass when halo mass is lower than a few @xmath2 @xmath86 @xmath160 .      with the preparation of above sections , we now analysis the baryon fraction in gravitational collapsed halos .",
    "the accuracy of the baryon fraction in selected halos relies on the calculation of the mass of baryonic matter enclosed in the viral radius .",
    "to reduce the system error , we divide each halo sphere into sub - cubic cells with size equal to @xmath162 of the sphere radius .",
    "we then use cloud - in - cell ( cic ) interpolation to determine the baryon density at each sub - cell .",
    "the halo mass @xmath163 and baryon mass are given by the sum of the mass of total matter and baryonic matter respectively in all the sub - cubic cells .",

    "the results of the two panels are statistically the identical . at a given halo mass , there are large scatters in the baryon fraction @xmath110 , the scatters are seen to be even more significant in the fof algorithm than the hop .",
    "this is consistent with figures 6 , which indicates a large scatter in @xmath110 at a given mass density .",
    "the distribution of @xmath110 is highly non - gaussian and has a long tail on the side of small @xmath110 , conforming with statistics of turbulent fluid , of which the velocity and density fields are intermittent and their pdfs have long tails",
    ".         regardless of the scatters , the distribution of @xmath110 in figure 7 can not be described by a single power law , but shows two distinct phases in halo mass - dependence . in the mass range",
    "@xmath165 @xmath86 @xmath160 , @xmath110 is weakly dependent on halo mass and takes a value of @xmath166 to @xmath167 of the cosmic mean , which is the first phase . when halo mass is less than @xmath168 @xmath160 , @xmath110 is quickly dropping off with decreasing halo mass , i.e. the second phase . at mass@xmath169 @xmath86 @xmath160 , @xmath110 is around @xmath170 of the cosmic mean . for halos with mass @xmath171 ,",

    "the effect of igm turbulence is not the only reason leading to the baryon missing .",
    "yet it should be an important dynamical reason of the baryon missing , especially for halos with mass @xmath195 @xmath86 m@xmath4 .",
    "the baryon depletion has attracted many studies with cosmological hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "as revealed in this paper , the missing baryon could be caused by the igm turbulence . in order to accurately study the effect of the turbulent igm on baryon fraction distribution and hence the baryon mission , the algorithm of hydrodynamical simulation should be effective to capture curved shocks , vortices , and intermittence of turbulence in the igm .",
    "it has been shown that the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method may not be able to handle shocks or discontinuities as well as grid method , because the nature of sph is to smooth between particles(tasker et al .",
    "the sph method is found to have strong damping of velocity fluctuations and fluid shear instabilities with respect to grid method ( agertz et al .",
    "moreover , the artificial viscous force ( dissipation ) in sph algorithm will reduce the reynolds number , and suppress the effect of turbulence ( dolag et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these factors would be part of the reasons that some sph simulations find the baryon fraction in halos to be generally only @xmath196 lower than the cosmic mean(e.g .",

    "1999 ; ettori 2006 ; crain et al .",

    "2009 ; burns , skillman & oshea 2010 ; ruszkowsky & oh 2010 ) . however , very few eulerian simulation has been conducted on the turbulent behavior of igm other than zhu et al.(2010 ) . oshea et al .",
    "( 2005 ) investigated the baryon fraction in halos at z = 3 during their study on the performance comparison of enzo and sph method without looking into tur- bulence .",
    "however , their small box , merely 3 mpc , and relative poorly resolved dark matter halos , typically tens to hundreds parti- cle in a halo , makes a meaningful comparison between their results and those presented in this paper unavailable . the energy cascade would be suppressed in small box , which would significantly re- strain the development of turbulence in the igm .",
    "very recently , the turbulence of igm is studied with grid based amr code enzo in- cluding a subgrid scale model for small scale unresolved turbulence in iapichino et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which yields many results similar to zhu et al ( 2010 ) .",
    "however , statistical study on the baryon fraction is not carried out .",
    "the weno algorithm embeded in our simulation uses a convex combination of all the stencils in the reconstruction procedure , where each stencil is assigned with a nonlinear weight depending on the local smoothness .",
    "this algorithm provides a high order accurate way to capture the non - oscillatory property near strong discontinuities as well as complex smooth solution features .",
    "this feature makes the weno scheme has gained rapid popularity in the simulation of complex - structure of hydrodynamical field ( shu 1999 , 2009 ) .",
    "the 5-th order weno scheme used in this work makes it possible to follow high reynolds number baryonic fluid . on the other hand , like other high order non - artificial - viscosity scheme , e.g. piecewise perturbation method ( ppm ) , with fixed grid ,",
    "the computation time needed is much more than the sph and amr method , which would become more obvious in higher resolution work .      to estimate the effect of turbulence of igm ,",
    "a key factor is the upper scale of fully developed turbulence . in some algorithm ,",
    "the energy of the turbulence is calculated with the fluctuations of velocity with respect to the mean velocity in cells with selected size .",
    "an underestimated cell size generally leads to undervalued turbulence ( dolag et al . 2005 ) . in our algorithm the upper scale of turbulence is determined by the relation @xmath197 , by which the ambiguity in selecting the cell size is avoided .",
    "star formation and its feedback on the igm evolution are not considered in our simulation .",
    "the injection of hot gas and energy by supernova explosions , agn or other sources of cosmic rays is not followed .",
    "these factors can be properly added , if the star formation history and radiative transfer is well known , which in turn need very high resolution .",
    "as mentioned above , the influence of injecting hot gas and energy by supernovae is believed to yield further decrease of @xmath110 in less massive halos , while feedback from agn might works in massive central galaxies . including all these mechanisms would give better consistency with observation .",
    "meanwhile , an accurate and robust observation result of baryon fraction in objects from as massive as galaxy cluster to low mass dwarf galaxy is full of challenge .",
    "large scatter in the observed quantities and significant system bias comes from the models applied in object structure and radiative transfer urges much more efforts to deal with .",
    "the spatial resolution of our simulation is @xmath198kpc , which is not enough to simulate virialized halos with mass less than times of @xmath199 @xmath86 m@xmath4 .",
    "the lower limit of the inertial range of turbulence may be affected by the grid resolution , which is already seen in the vorticity power spectra given by samples with different resolution in zhu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the box size of our simulation is @xmath200mpc .",
    "it may lose the effect of long wavelength perturbations and hence underestimate the nonlinear evolution of igm velocity field .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the basic dynamical picture features revealed by the current samples would be valid when these factors are improved .",
    "since gravity is of scale free , it is generally believed that in the scenario of hierarchical clustering , the formation and evolution of halos is scale free in a large range of halo mass .",
    "however , the dynamics of the system consisting of two components , dark matter and igm , is very different from those of one component system . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", the hydrodynamical nature of the igm leads to the dynamical and statistical departure of the igm from the dark matter .",
    "the two component system is no longer to follow the scaling of gravitational clustering of pure dark matter .",
    "this deviation is a reason of the baryon missing in gravitational collapsed halos .",
    "the dynamical equation of vorticity does not contain terms of gravity .",
    "therefore , the igm turbulence characterized by the vorticity will yield , at least , two scales , which violate the scale free of the gravitational hierarchical clustering : 1 . ) the length scale on which the igm fluid has been developed to the state of fully developed turbulence ; 2 . ) the mass scale on which the turbulence pressure is comparable with gravity of halo considered .",
    "these scales play important role in the evolution of baryon fraction . with cosmological hydrodynamic simulation",
    ", we find that at @xmath99 the first scale is about 3 h@xmath3 mpc , and the second one is @xmath169",
    "h@xmath3 m@xmath4 . with these results",
    ", we reach to the following conclusions :    \\i .",
    "the distribution of baryon fraction is highly nonuniform on scales from hundreds kpc to a few of mpc , and @xmath0 varies from as low as 1% to a few times of the cosmic mean .",
    "the turbulence can effectively prevent the igm from falling into potential wells of dark matter halos with mass @xmath169 h@xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0 in dark matter halos is decreasing from @xmath201 at halo mass scales around @xmath6 @xmath7 m@xmath4 to @xmath8 at @xmath2 h@xmath3 m@xmath4 due to the turbulent state of the igm .    the estimated turbulence pressure at @xmath99 correspond to a random motion with r.m.s velocity of about @xmath202 km @xmath203 in the scale range from hundreds of kpc and up to @xmath204 mpc .",
    "the turbulent pressure is dynamical and non - thermal .",
    "when the turbulence dissipated , its kinetic energy becomes the thermal energy .",
    "it yields the entropy in halos ( he , feng , & fang 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , the dissipation of turbulence actually is a mechanism of heating , which gives a compensation to the cooling of gas in halos .",
    "this result is consistent with the burgers shock heating ( he et al 2004 ) . in summmary",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamical effect of the turbulence in baryonic intergalactic medium ( igm ) on the baryon fraction distribution . in the fully developed nonlinear regime </S>",
    "<S> , the igm will evolve into the state of turbulence , containing strong and curved shocks , vorticity and complex structures . </S>",
    "<S> turbulence would lead to the density and velocity fields of the igm to be different from those of underlying collisionless dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the baryon fraction @xmath0 will deviate from its cosmic mean @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we study these phenomena with simulation samples produced by the weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) hybrid cosmological hydrodynamic / n - body code , which is effective of capturing shocks and complex structures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the distribution of baryon fraction is highly nonuniform on scales from hundreds kpc to a few of mpc , and @xmath0 varies from as low as 1% to a few times of the cosmic mean . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the turbulence pressure in the igm is weakly scale - dependent and comparable to the gravitational energy density of halos with mass around @xmath2 h@xmath3 m@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon fraction in halos with mass equal to or smaller than @xmath2 h@xmath3 m@xmath4 should be substantially lower than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that @xmath0 is decreasing from @xmath5 at halo mass scales around @xmath6 @xmath7 m@xmath4 to @xmath8 at @xmath2 h@xmath3 m@xmath4 and shows further decrease when halo mass is less than @xmath2 h@xmath3 m@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the strong mass dependence of @xmath0 is similar to the observed results . </S>",
    "<S> although the simulated @xmath9 in halos are higher than the observed value by a factor of 2 , the turbulence of the igm should be an important dynamical reason leading to the remarkable missing of baryonic matter in halos with mass @xmath10 h@xmath3 m@xmath4 .    </S>",
