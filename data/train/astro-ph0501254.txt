    "nowadays it is commonly accepted that the quark - gluon phase of the matter can be formed in the course of heavy - ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "there are indirect signatures that this state has been produced at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it was suggested long ago  @xcite that quark matter may exist either in the interior of some stars or as a new family of pure quark stars .",
    "then it was realized that some rather massive neutron stars may have a quark core ( so called hybrid stars ) , cf .",
    "refs @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently the idea of quark pairing with high values of the gap ( up to @xmath0mev ) attracted much attention , cf .",
    "observable signals of quark matter , presumably existing in interiors of hybrid and pure quark stars , are under extensive discussion .",
    "the most promising of these signals seem to be an abnormal mass - radius relation  @xcite , @xmath1-mode spin - down  @xcite , and a specific steller cooling properties  @xcite .",
    "although there is no _ a priori _ obstacle to existence of the quark matter in above the mentioned forms , the actual theoretical predictions are very uncertain .",
    "they hinge on the lack of understanding of the confinement mechanism in qcd .",
    "therefore , parameters of theoretical quark models can not be anchored to experimental observables .",
    "most of the treatments are based on either the standard or slightly modified mit bag model , or the nambu  jona - lasino ( njl ) model , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in terms of a bag model ,",
    "the main uncertainty is associated with the value of the vacuum pressure , i.e. the bag constant @xmath2 .",
    "the steller properties are sensitive to this .",
    "a large value of @xmath2 excludes the existence of hybrid stars . with a decrease of @xmath2 ,",
    "first the most massive neutron stars acquire a quark core , becoming hybrid stars . for a small @xmath2 , strange quark matter becomes absolutely stable , i.e. more stable than @xmath3  @xcite",
    ". then pure quark stars ( strangelets ) of an arbitrary size may exist , being hold together by strong rather than gravitational forces .",
    "physical implications of the existence of a self - bound strange quark matter are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a straightforward calculation of the properties of strongly interacting matter and , in particular its equation of state ( eos ) , is possible on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "this technique is progressing rapidly .",
    "so far , the main body of lattice results concern the case of zero baryon chemical potential ( @xmath4 ) and finite temperatures .",
    "this case is just opposite to that of cold baryon matter present in the quark stars .",
    "recently new lattice predictions on the eos at finite , but small , baryon chemical potentials became available @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they are still far from the astrophysically relevant domain .",
    "therefore , a theoretical modeling is needed for their extrapolation .",
    "the interpretation of these lattice results within phenomenological quasiparticle models , i.e. in terms of effectively massive quarks and gluons with a simple interaction , turned out to be very successful both at zero chemical potential  @xcite and at small finite ones  @xcite . with few phenomenological parameters it was possible to reasonably reproduce all lattice thermodynamic quantities .",
    "effectively the results can be interpreted in terms of a modified mit bag model for massive quarks with density and temperature dependent bag constant and masses .",
    "these models can be used to extrapolate the lattice eos to the domain of cold baryon matter .",
    "this has been done by peshier , kmpfer and soff  @xcite for the thermodynamic quasiparticle model of ref .",
    "they considered the possibility of the existence of quark stars and found a mass - radius relation for them .",
    "they concluded that quark stars with a mass larger than @xmath5 may only exist for values of the effective bag constant @xmath6  mev , whereas their model produced a higher value .",
    "the possible existence of hybrid stars was not considered in that work .",
    "it is important to mention that the quasiparticle model of ref .",
    "@xcite was fitted only to the @xmath4 lattice data available at that time and then it was extrapolated to finite values of the baryon chemical potential .",
    "the later fit of the same model to recent lattice data at finite baryon chemical potentials  @xcite resulted in somewhat different parameters of this quasiparticle model  @xcite .",
    "the same quasiparticle model of ref .",

    "@xcite were derived concerning the properties of quark stars .    in this paper",
    "we would like to make `` lattice qcd motivated '' predictions on the possible existence of hybrid and quark stars , as well as their properties . to do this , we extrapolate the existing lattice results to the region of cold electroneutral baryon matter relying on the phenomenological qcd motivated dynamical - quasiparticle ( dq ) model recently proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "in equilibrium , at high temperatures the dq model complies with the quasiparticle picture of the hard thermal loop approach  @xcite , whereas at lower temperatures it simulates the confinement of the qcd .",
    "the latter is manifested by the fact that the solution to the model equations simply does not exist below certain combination of the temperature and the chemical potential .",
    "two sets of parameters of this model ( below denoted as `` 1-loop '' and `` 2-loop '' ) were fitted to reproduce lattice data at finite baryon chemical potentials  @xcite .",
    "extrapolation of the lattice data to the case of the cold baryon matter is essentially simpler in this model than in that of ref .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the case of `` light - bag-155 '' model the pairing may substantially affect the eos and hence quark star masses .",
    "the difference between normal and cfl quark star masses increases up to @xmath65 in the region @xmath66 .",
    "the limiting mass is @xmath67 and the radius is @xmath68  km .",
    "thus , for these models the @xmath69@xmath70 and @xmath69@xmath71 relations are similar to those one usually uses for pure hadronic eos s , in agreement with the statement of ref . @xcite . for the `` light - bag-200(@xmath72 )",
    "'' model the limiting mass is @xmath73 and the radius is @xmath74  km .",
    "this limiting mass is smaller than several well measured masses of pulsars .",
    "thus we may conclude that the `` light - bag-200 '' model does not describe ordinary pulsars but rather another family of compact objects .",
    "the effect of the pairing is less pronounced here than for the `` light - bag-155 '' model .",
    "let us remind that the `` light - bag-155(@xmath75 ) '' and `` light - bag-200(@xmath72 ) '' models matched with either `` hadron mw1 '' or `` hadron mw2 '' hadronic models also predict existence of hybrid stars . had we assumed a softer hadron eos , the corresponding hybrid stars would become impossible and we would only have pure quark stars .    for the `` heavy - bag '' model and especially for the dq model , the masses and radii are still smaller and the interior region , denser . for the `` heavy - bag '' model",
    "the limiting mass is @xmath76 and the radius is @xmath77  km .",
    "these configurations are similar to those previously studied in the model of ref .",
    "for the dq model the limiting mass is @xmath78 and the radius is @xmath79  km .",
    "the central density is @xmath80 .",
    "such dense quark matter is probably realized in the cfl phase that has peculiar cooling properties .",
    "small and dense objects might be of interest with respect to macho events @xcite .",
    "models for deconfined quark matter are extensively used in astrophysical applications .",
    "the discussion of hypothetical hybrid and quark stars is a rather hot topic . in this paper",
    "we emphasize that it is essential for a deconfined quark model to be constrained by the lattice qcd results , which became recently available at finite baryon chemical potential .",
    "rapidly progressing lattice calculations may essentially restrict models used for the description of cold and dense quark matter . in this paper",
    "we are trying to make a step in this direction . at this time",
    ", we would like to draw attention to problems with traditionally used simple standard bag and , probably , njl models .",
    "they are not able to reproduce the lattice data without significant modifications .",
    "we have considered the dynamical quasiparticle model  @xcite and the heavy - bag model , which fit the lattice results .",
    "the heavy - bag model uses heavy masses of quarks and gluons to reproduce the lattice results well .",
    "we have demonstrated , that these models , being matched with realistic hadron models of eos , rule out the existence of hybrid stars .",
    "this implies that families of ordinary neutron stars and pure quark stars are well separated . within these models",
    "the quark stars have low masses ( @xmath81 ) , are dense ( @xmath82 ) and very compact ( @xmath83  km ) .",
    "this result complies with that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of a different extrapolation of lattice data to cold dense baryonic matter .",
    "if such a quark star existed in a binary system ( together with a white dwarf , a neutron star , or together with another quark star ) , the orbiting would be different from that experimentally known for both white dwarf ",
    "neutron star and double neutron star systems .",
    "moreover , such dense quark matter may be in the color - flavor - locked superconducting phase and hence possess peculiar cooling properties .",
    "other properties of these pure quark stars also differ from those of neutron stars that may give a chance to distinguish them experimentally , e.g. , see ref .",
    "another interesting question arises , what could be a possible formation mechanism of such compact and dense quark stars ? for the birth of a quark star , a hybrid star configuration is first required in order to produce a quark core either during supernova collapse or during the long - term accretion of the matter in a binary system , or in the course of the merging of two neutron stars .",
    "the nucleation dynamics of quark matter in a cold neutron star was considered recently in ref .",
    ". then also a mechanism to blow off the hadron shell is needed , e.g. , like that discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a strong first - order phase transition .    in the present paper the models for deconfined matter , which are fitted to lattice predictions ,",
    "allow neither hybrid stars nor quark self - bound objects ( strangelets ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that only the unrealistically stiff original walecka model ( `` hadron - w '' ) matched with either the dq or `` heavy - bag '' models may allow for a small quark core .",
    "thus , we actually see no appropriate mechanism to form quark stars that are described by our dq and heavy - bag models .",
    "temperature , rotation , and neutrino trapping effects should be included .",
    "they may stiffen the hadron eos  @xcite and perhaps may help to resolve the problem . some exotic ways to produce quark stars through either evolution of white dwarfs or inflation stage at the quark ",
    "hadron phase transition are discussed in refs @xcite .",
    "certainly , this problem still needs further consideration .",
    "it is necessarily to mention uncertainties in the present considerations and the conclusions derived .",
    "first of all , they are connected with lattice data @xcite , which we extrapolate to the domain of cold and dense baryonic matter .",
    "these data obtained on a discrete lattice are only poorly extrapolated to the continuum limit .",
    "another problem with the lattice data consists in the poor reproduction of the chiral limit .",
    "as we have mentioned already , the pion turns out to be very heavy in lattice calculations , e.g. @xmath84  mev @xcite .",
    "all this may result in certain errors in the parameters of our effective models , deduced from these data .",
    "we have tried to estimate this kind of uncertainties by applying different extrapolations from the lattice data , i.e. the `` 1-loop '' and `` 2-loop '' versions of the dq model and the `` heavy - bag '' model . indeed , whereas the `` 2-loop '' version closely reproduces the lattice data @xcite , the `` 1-loop '' version slightly ( by 10% ) misfits its normalization , thus leaving room for uncertainty in the extrapolation to the continuum and chiral limits . as for the `` heavy - bag '' model , it covers the lattice data by a rather broad band ( due to variation of @xmath85 ) .    on the other hand , the grounds for the standard bag model , in our case represented by the `` light - bag-155 '' and `` light - bag-200 '' models , are not entirely reliable .",
    "indeed , the bag parameters of standard bag models are fitted to reproduce the masses of hadrons , i.e. few - body systems , and then applied to describe matter .",
    "it could happen that the situation here is similar to that of walecka model for nuclear matter .",
    "if we fit the walecka model to reproduce the deutron or helium and then apply it to @xmath86pb , we surely get nonsense .",
    "therefore , predictions of these models for the eos should be treated with great care .",
    "theoretical uncertainties in our predictions should be mentioned as well .",
    "the region of the vicinity of @xmath87 deserves special discussion . besides the above mentioned uncertainties of the lattice calculations , as it is known , in the ( 2 + 1)-flavor case the phase transition at small chemical potentials is of the cross - over type @xcite .",
    "this implies that the hadronic and quark  gluon degrees of freedom essentially interact in this region , e.g. , see ref .",
    "this is why we can not pretend to reproduce the lattice data in this region by means of only quark  gluon degrees of freedom incorporated in the dq model .",
    "our aim was to fit these data beyond this vicinity region and then to extrapolate them to the domain of the cold and dense baryon matter .",
    "as it is commonly expected , the phase transition in this domain is of the first order , which implies a less severe role of the hadron  quark  gluon interaction . therefore , we hope that the method of matching hadronic and quark  gluon eos s , applied in this domain , is reasonable .",
    "however , the uncertainty of such an extrapolation should be kept in mind . we can not also exclude that our models are oversimplified and some important physics is left aside , e.g.",
    ", the model suffers of a lack of the chiral symmetry restoration , thermal fluctuations are not included , which may play an important role in the vicinity of the critical temperature but die out at smaller and higher temperatures , etc .",
    "this may somehow modify the fitting parameters of models .",
    "quantum fluctuations like instantons and gluon condensate may partially survive and additionally contribute in the low temperature region , cf .",
    "thus , it might well be that the dq model , as well as the heavy - bag model , should be replaced in the future by more sophisticated and realistic microscopically based models . nevertheless , a certain confidence in our results is supported by the fact that other independent extrapolations of the lattice data to the cold dense baryonic matter @xcite resulted in rather similar conclusions . however , it would be of interest to search for new theoretical approaches for extrapolating the eos from @xmath88 mev to @xmath89 and from @xmath90 mev upwards .",

    "<S> a qcd - motivated dynamical - quasiparticle model with parameters adjusted to reproduce the lattice - qcd equation of state is extrapolated from region of high temperatures and moderate baryonic densities to the domain of high baryonic densities and zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equation of state matched with realistic hadronic equations of state predicts a phase transition into the quark phase at higher densities than those reachable in neutron star interiors . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes the possibility of the existence of hybrid ( hadron - quark ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> pure quark stars are possible and have low masses , small radii and very high central densities . </S>",
    "<S> similar results are obtained for a simple bag model with massive quarks , fitted to reproduce the same lattice results . </S>",
    "<S> self - bound quark matter is also excluded within these models . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties in the present extrapolation are discussed . </S>",
