    "during the last decade the physics of many - particle systems at relativistic energies has attracted increasing interest . on the one hand , this was due to the hope that high - energy ion collisions at present day colliders would reach the kinematical regime of the quark - gluon - plasma phase of qcd and would thus give new insight into the phase structure of qcd and into the confinement phenomena . on the other hand , a better understanding of such systems can be applied to ultrarelativistic astrophysical and/or cosmological configurations and should therefore provide a conceptual tool for describing the physics of the early universe , in particular phenomena such as baryon number generation , big - bang nucleosynthesis , etc . although it is not yet clear to what extent the various mentioned configurations can be considered as being in thermal equilibrium , the first attempts at a systematic analysis concentrated on equilibrium statistical mechanics .    since we are convinced that the interaction of particles at energies up to 1 tev is described by the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions , the main task consists in formulating a consistent thermal quantum field theory of qcd and qed .",
    "because qcd is asymptotically free , the corresponding running coupling parameter becomes small at a sufficiently high temperature @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) being considered as a measure of the average energy of the system s constituents .",
    "] and a perturbative treatment seems possible .",
    "this expectation is supported by the observation that lattice gauge theory calculations @xcite indicate that the physics of the ( quark-)gluon plasma at @xmath0 larger than four times the critical temperature @xmath3 is to a very good approximation that of an ideal gas . in particular , the free energy @xmath4 of such a system is off the ideal gas value by less than @xmath5 .",
    "even more , if masses with an appropriate temperature dependence are accepted , the lattice results @xcite agree almost exactly with the ideal gas ones for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "this would suggest that perturbative treatments remain candidates for a description of the relevant phenomena .",
    "unfortunately , a straightforward perturbative treatment has led to results which are far from satisfactory .",
    "the problems emerging can be seen best in the expressions for the free energy @xmath4 as calculated in various theoretical models .",
    "the most exhaustive calculations , up to @xmath7 , have been performed for the massless @xmath1 theory @xcite and for qcd ( without and with quarks ) @xcite .",
    "these results have the following unpleasant features :    1 .",
    "there is a very bad convergence behavior of the series , some of the higher - order terms in the perturbation series are larger than the leading term unless the coupling parameter is very small  in qcd , the coupling @xmath8 would have to be at @xmath9 tev .",
    "if successive orders are included in the truncated perturbation series ( tps ) , the sum takes on alternating large values ( cf . fig .  1 of ref .",
    "every fixed order the tps s show a strong dependence of the ( arbitrary ) renormalization scale ( rscl ) @xmath10 .",
    "this results in an additional severe uncertainty of the evaluation , this time due to the ambiguity of the choice of the rscl @xmath10 . in an asymptotically free theory one usually is on the safe side if one chooses @xmath10 close to the ( lowest ) physically relevant momentum scale typical of the contributing configurations , since otherwise the expansion coefficients would blow up . in the case of a system at temperature @xmath0 one would be led to choose @xmath11 , or more specifically @xmath12 , i.e. , the energy of the first nonvanishing matsubara mode .",
    "in fact , this is the choice actually used in the literature .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that in the case of a plasma consisting of massless components there are important physical effects connected with much lower energies ( screening of the chromoelectric or chromomagnetic field ) .",
    "therefore , the choice @xmath13 seems not to be well founded , _ a priori_.    these features are related to the rather large genuine collective effects . and ,",
    "in fact , it has been noted recently that these unexpectedly large corrections are rooted in the terms @xmath14 within the expansions .",
    "such terms render the expression nonanalytic in @xmath15 and they do not emerge in the ordinary ( @xmath16 ) field theory .",
    "they are the result of a certain ( partial ) resummation which is necessary to get rid of these infrared divergences @xcite .",
    "they are closely related with collective effects such as screening or landau damping .",
    "this observation has constituted the basis for several attempts to remedy the situation : since a specific method of resummation seems to be the root of the problems , one is led to try different resummation procedures .",
    "the main attempt goes under the name of screened perturbation theory ( spt ) @xcite and has been made more systematic by what is called optimized perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to add a local mass term to the free part of the lagrangian and subtract it from the interaction part .",
    "the former is treated nonperturbatively , constituting a genuine ( screening ) mass ; the latter perturbatively .",
    "physically this means that one expands about a ( ideal ) gas of massive quasiparticles ( dressed gluons , for example ) rather than about massless particles .",
    "the technical consequences are striking .",
    "since the objects one starts with are massive , there is no infrared problem and no need for resummation , and the resulting expressions have better convergence behavior than the original perturbation series .",
    "however , for obtaining numerical results , one has to fix the chosen mass at the final stage .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , e.g. , used ( an appropriate approximation of ) the gap equation for fixing this mass .",
    "all this is relatively straightforward in a theory such as @xmath1 where nothing forbids a genuine mass term . within a gauge theory like qcd",
    "the whole procedure becomes much more cumbersome , since the addition of a genuine ( local ) mass term would spoil the gauge symmetry from the outset .",
    "a technical way out of this problem is hard - thermal loop ( htl ) perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this is a spt generalization which respects gauge invariance .",
    "the procedure again rests on a ( partial ) resummation : those higher - order loop corrections are included that are of leading order in @xmath17 for amplitudes involving soft external momenta @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting htl correction terms are nonlocal .",
    "this leads to complicated uv divergences , and only some of them are canceled by physical mechanisms ( quasiparticle formation and landau damping ) .",
    "the rest have to be tamed by artificial counterterms proportional to the quasiparticle mass and they generate an additional renormalization scale dependence . despite this complicated and not uniquely specified procedure , the resulting series has again a better convergence behavior than the original perturbation series . on the other hand ,",
    "when the so called @xmath19-derivable approximation scheme @xcite is applied , some of the problems of the htl perturbation theory are avoided . in this scheme ,",
    "the htl contributions to the free energy were resummed in ref .",
    "@xcite in @xmath1 theory , qed , and qcd , but the uv divergences were shown to cancel . a related approach which uses the framework of the scalar @xmath20-symmetric model in the large-@xmath21 limit",
    "was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . another approach , overcoming the infrared problems appearing in the conventional perturbation theory and using dressed propagators , was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , the strong renormalization scale ( rscl ) dependence is not or not sufficiently reduced by the spt or htl approach .",
    "further , there remains a principal question : why are the spt results so much better than those of the naive perturbation approach ?",
    "although the need for resummation is avoided in the first step in spt due to the mass @xmath22 of the quasiparticle , the correct choice of the specific formula for @xmath22 again needs a resummation implicitly contained in the gap equation .",
    "as long as these points are not clarified , the spt treatment can not be considered fully satisfying .",
    "a completely different way of remedying the weak points of the naive perturbation theory consists in replacing the truncated perturbation series ( tps ) by appropriate pad approximants ( pa s ) .",
    "this approach is motivated by at least two features of pa s : first , pa s at increasing order in general show much better convergence than the tps s from which they are obtained .",
    "it has been shown that even when the tps s are divergent ( asymptotic series ) , the corresponding pa s may converge and do it under rather general conditions @xcite .",
    "secondly , pa s reduce considerably the rscl dependence of the tps .",
    "in fact , it is known that the diagonal pa s , constructed from a tps of an rscl - independent quantity in powers of @xmath23 , are rscl - independent in the limit of the one - loop running of the coupling parameter @xmath24 ( large @xmath25-limit ) @xcite .",
    "further , related approximants have been developed which are exactly rscl - independent @xcite and even renormalization scheme independent @xcite .",
    "since the full perturbation series corresponds to a physical ( in principle measurable ) quantity , this quantity is exactly rscl - independent .",
    "therefore , one is led to conjecture that pa s and related approximants are nearer to the true value than the original tps s . the physical reason for the ( approximate ) rscl independence of such approximants",
    "is that they include a certain resummation @xcite , thus containing infinitely many terms whose absence was responsible for the spurious rscl - dependence of the tps .",
    "the first applications of pa s to thermal perturbation theory were made by kastening @xcite and by hatsuda @xcite .",
    "these authors started from the the available tps for the free energy @xmath4 ( in @xmath1 and qcd ) , which is a tps in powers of @xmath26 , up to @xmath27 , and replaced it by various pa s based on it .",
    "they demonstrated improved rscl stability of these pa s .",
    "although the relatively large number of powers in @xmath28 of the underlying tps suggests a good convergence quality of the resulting pa s , the results have to be treated with caution .",
    "first , there is no formal reason to expect that certain pa s , specifically the diagonal ones , should be stable under variation of the rscl . in this respect ,",
    "we note that it is the one - loop ( large-@xmath25 ) running of @xmath29 , @xmath30 which is responsible for the ( large-@xmath25 ) rscl independence in diagonal pa s of underlying tps s in powers of @xmath31 .",
    "this is so because relation ( [ 1lrun ] ) represents a homographic transformation @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "however , relation ( [ 1lrun ] ) yields a structurally different one - loop running of @xmath33 , namely @xmath34^{1/2 } } \\ , \\qquad   ( \\beta_0^{\\prime } \\equiv \\frac{\\beta_0}{4 \\pi^2 } ) \\ . \\label{1lgrun}\\ ] ] this relation is not homographic , and consequently the pa s in such a case need not be ( large-@xmath25 ) rscl - invariant .",
    "there is a second , more significant point of criticism of the aforementioned pa approach .",
    "it can be best explained in terms of diagrams .",
    "as we have mentioned , the pa s represent a resummation ( analytic continuation ) of the infinite sum of a certain class of diagrams .",
    "on the other hand , the tps expressions for @xmath35 also include a selective resummation ( of ring and super - ring diagrams ) .",
    "therefore , a naive application of pa s to the original tps constitutes a mixing of ( at least ) two inequivalent resummation effects and could easily lead to partial double - counting or other ( interference - like ) inconsistencies . in the context of qed and qcd at @xmath16 ,",
    "somewhat similar aspects have been pointed out and accounted for in refs .",
    "@xcite .    within the present paper",
    "we want to stick to pa s because of their unique advantages : reduced rscl - dependence , better convergence properties , and ( quasi)analytic continuation aspects .",
    "however , we are going to develop a procedure that is free of the aforementioned weaknesses .",
    "we do this by separating all the terms in the full available tps into groups which represent tps s of separate physical , i.e. , rscl - independent , quantities .",
    "to each of the tps s we apply pa s separately .",
    "the resulting expressions are not only ( approximately ) rscl - independent , but are supposed to represent better approximations to the true values since double - counting and interference - like inconsistencies are excluded .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the main elements of our method . in sec .",
    "iii we apply this method to qcd , and in sec .",
    "iv to the massless @xmath1 theory .",
    "section v summarizes the results and presents conclusions .",
    "we start with the perturbatively calculated expressions for the free energy density @xmath4 both for massless @xmath1 and for qcd .",
    "they have been calculated recently @xcite up to @xmath7 , i.e. , three loops plus all the ring diagrams summed up .",
    "the generic structure of the resulting expressions is @xmath36 \\ . \\label{genericf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath31 is short - hand for @xmath37 , i.e. , the running ( rscl - dependent ) coupling parameter . the renormalization scheme ( rsch )",
    "is assumed to be fixed , say @xmath38 .",
    "the rscl - running is described by the perturbatively specified renormalization group equation ( rge ) @xmath39 it is interesting to note that in the series ( [ genericf ] ) the coefficients @xmath40 do not depend on the rscl @xmath10 , but @xmath41 and @xmath42 do , the @xmath10-dependence showing up as an additive contribution @xmath43 $ ] to the corresponding coefficient . in qcd",
    ", @xmath41 includes a term @xmath44 $ ] [ @xmath45 ; in @xmath1 theory , @xmath42 includes a term @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "it is crucial to keep in mind the origin of the various terms : the terms @xmath46 and @xmath27 come exclusively from the resummation of the ring diagrams that is necessary to avoid infrared divergences @xcite .",
    "this resummation procedure also yields part of the coefficient @xmath41 of the @xmath47 term .",
    "in particular , the contributions @xmath48 in @xmath41 and @xmath42 are generated by this procedure as the remnant of the emerging dependence on the screening mass .",
    "the other terms ( @xmath49 , and the remaining part of @xmath41 ) stem from ordinary perturbation theory in powers of @xmath31 and do not contain resummation effects .",
    "we further note that the term @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) can not be obtained by perturbative methods ( which include ring summation ) because of the severe infrared divergences appearing at that order @xcite .",
    "our aim is to apply pad approximants ( pa s ) in a consistent manner to a tps of the type ( [ genericf ] ) .",
    "as argued in the introduction , in order to avoid an uncontrollable mixing and superposition of different resummations , the separation of the pure perturbative from the ring resummation - generated terms should be performed .",
    "in addition , however , we want to take advantage of the approximate @xmath10-independence of the pa s when they are applied to tps s ( in @xmath31 ) of @xmath10-independent quantities .",
    "therefore , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ genericf ] ) should be split so that the resulting parts ( infinite power series ) represent quantities that are @xmath10-independent ( `` physical '' ) separately .",
    "this suggests that a physical principle of separation should be involved , i.e. , one which is connected with measurable effects .    in finding such a separation principle one",
    "is guided by the decomposition of all thermodynamic quantities in ( fourier ) modes . within the imaginary time formalism",
    ", the free energy @xmath4 at every given order is expressed as a sum over the matsubara frequencies @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "since the thermodynamic quantities and correlation functions can be derived from @xmath4 , they also show up as sums over modes . for a given correlation function",
    "the contribution from the ( exchange of the ) fourier mode with frequency @xmath52 falls off at large spatial distances as @xmath55 ( at least if @xmath0 is larger than all contributing masses ) .",
    "therefore , the only mode which does not produce an exponentially vanishing contribution to the long - range correlation functions is the bosonic zero mode @xmath56 [ eq .",
    "( [ matsubos ] ) ] .",
    "consequently , at sufficiently high @xmath0 , the static correlators of the contributing fields at large distances @xmath57 are exclusively determined by the zero mode .",
    "since this long - distance behavior of correlators is , at least in principle , observable ( `` physical '' ) , the procedure of separating the bosonic zero - mode ( long - distance ) contributions from all the other ( short - distance ) ones rests on physical grounds .",
    "we therefore expect that both contributions are separately @xmath10-independent since both have a physical meaning .",
    "further , we know that all resummation effects in the series ( [ genericf ] ) contribute exclusively to the long - distance part .",
    "this is so because these resummation effects of the ring diagrams exclusively stem from the zero - mode contributions , which represent the strongest infrared divergences at the single diagram level .",
    "the long - distance part , i.e. , the resummed ring diagrams , shows up as a power series in powers of @xmath58 , starting with the @xmath59 term .",
    "the short - distance part , on the other hand , has the ordinary perturbation character  a perturbation series in integer powers of @xmath15 .",
    "the discussed decomposition of @xmath4 represents the basis for our improvement of the underlying tps results : we apply the appropriate pa s to the separate parts , so that ( at least some of ) the approximants are approximately rscl - independent , and presumably better converging . in the case of the short - range contributions these are the diagonal pa s @xmath60(a)$ ] . at the available order of the underlying tps ( [ genericf ] ) , the short - range part is of the form @xmath61 , and the only possible diagonal pa is @xmath62(a)$].(x)$ ] for a quantity @xmath63 is a ratio of two polynomials of @xmath64th and @xmath65th degree in @xmath66 : @xmath67(x ) = p_n(x)/p_m(x)$ ] , such that its expansion in powers of @xmath66 reproduces the terms up to @xmath68 of the expansion of @xmath63 : @xmath69 .",
    "] in the case of the long - range contributions , one tries to see which pa @xmath67(g)$ ] ( @xmath70 ) is approximately rscl - independent .    before continuing ,",
    "we mention an alternative way to interprete the described decomposition on physical grounds : the long - distance contribution reflects the observable phenomena of screening of interactions and formation of quasiparticles ( collective modes ) . to understand this , we recall the following facts .",
    "it is with the resummation of the ring diagrams that the zero modes acquire a ( screening ) mass @xmath71 ( @xmath72 can be defined as the solution of the gap equation @xcite ) . and vice - versa : it is the screening phenomenon which explains the striking fact that , while all individual ring diagrams are infrared divergent , their total sum is convergent . from this one",
    "concludes that , due to the observable nature of the screening phenomenon , the long - range part @xmath73 , which encompasses the resummation - generated effects , is of physical nature and should therefore be rscl - independent .",
    "this can best be seen by determining the screening mass via the gap equation @xcite which is equivalent to summing up the ring diagrams .",
    "this interpretation also shows that in theories with more degrees of freedom ( like qcd ) there might be several stages of screening , e.g. , screening of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic gluons , respectively .",
    "consequently , the free energy @xmath4 can then be decomposed into more than two parts : the short - distance part , and one part for each kind of screening .",
    "having described the physical idea behind our approach , we have not yet addressed the technical problem of actual decomposition . in principle , the answer is simple : in order to single out the long - range ( zero - mode ) contribution , one has to integrate out all higher modes ( bosonic , and all fermionic modes ) .",
    "the resulting expression , when subtracted from the full expression , should yield the short - distance contribution , i.e. , that of all the nonzero modes . in practice , integrating out explicitly all higher modes is a cumbersome task . fortunately , there exists an alternative method , the method of effective field theories , which was developed for thermal perturbation theory by braaten and nieto @xcite .",
    "the method can be briefly described as follows . at small distances ( @xmath74 )",
    "the behavior of the system is determined by ordinary perturbative qcd . on the other hand ,",
    "the long - distance behavior is dominated by the zero modes and can , consequently , be described by an effective field theory which , at large @xmath0 , is a bosonic field theory in three dimensions ( `` dimensional reduction '' @xcite ) .",
    "the effective bosonic field is approximately identified with the zero modes of the original fields . for the construction of the effective field theory",
    "one does not need to specify this effective ( static ) boson field in terms of the original fields exactly .",
    "one simply writes down the most general three - dimensional lagrangian for the effective fields that respects the symmetries of the original theory . in general",
    ", this effective lagrangian contains infinitely many terms  operator expressions of arbitrary high dimensions  and is thus nonrenormalizable .",
    "therefore , an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath75 is needed .",
    "the corresponding effective coupling parameters @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ; @xmath78 stands for effective ) are then determined by a matching procedure : one computes sufficiently many static correlation functions , both in the original and in the effective theory , with as yet unspecified @xmath76 , and demands that the results agree at larger distances @xmath79 .",
    "the resulting matching relations allow one to express the effective @xmath76 s in terms of the original coupling parameter @xmath28 , @xmath0 , and the cutoff @xmath75 : @xmath80 the cutoff @xmath75 ( @xmath81 ) , also called the factorization scale , is roughly the momentum below which the effective theory should take over .",
    "relations ( [ gei ] ) can be understood as perturbation series in the coupling parameters @xmath28 .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath76 s corresponding to interaction operators with higher dimensions are of higher order in @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , for calculation at a given order only a very restricted number of @xmath76 s has to be taken into account .",
    "the effective theory approach has been applied by braaten and nieto to @xmath1 theory @xcite and to qcd @xcite .    in the case of @xmath82",
    "there is only one cutoff @xmath75 separating the long- and short - distance regimes @xcite .",
    "consequently , the free energy density @xmath4 consists of two parts @xmath83 where the long - range part @xmath84 is determined by the effective theory and contains the effective coupling parameters @xmath76 .",
    "if these @xmath76 s are expanded in powers of @xmath28 , then eq .",
    "( [ fphi4 ] ) yields the formula for @xmath4 that was originally obtained perturbatively by including the ring - diagram resummation @xcite .",
    "it is a check of consistency of the effective field approach to show that the total expression for @xmath4 is independent of the factorization scale @xmath75 .",
    "in qcd one can separate from the short - distance regime two long - distance regimes ( chromoelectric and chromomagnetic ) @xcite corresponding to two types of screening .",
    "therefore one can apply two effective theories .",
    "one is called the electrostatic qcd ( eqcd ) , and contains electrostatic and magnetostatic effective gauge fields .",
    "it describes the physics of the quark - gluon system at distances @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the mass scale of the chromomagnetic screening .",
    "the other is called magnetostatic qcd ( mqcd ) , and contains only magnetostatic fields .",
    "it acts at distances @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the magnetic screening mass , which , however , can not be calculated perturbatively because of severe infrared divergences at the order @xmath89 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the free energy density @xmath4 of hot qcd consists of three contributions :    1 .   the short - distance [ @xmath90 contribution @xmath91 of nonzero modes , i.e. , the modes with frequencies equal to and higher than the first matsubara frequency @xmath92 ; 2 .   the long - distance contribution @xmath93 , with @xmath94 , i.e. , the collective modes described by eqcd effective theory ; and 3 .",
    "the `` rest '' contribution @xmath95 from even larger scales @xmath96 of mqcd effective theory .",
    "each of these three contributions is expected to be physical , i.e. , @xmath10-independent .",
    "we will first apply our approach to qcd since this is physically and experimentally the most interesting case .",
    "the free energy density @xmath4 , for an arbitrary number @xmath97 of quark generations , has been calculated in thermal perturbation theory up to terms @xmath27 @xcite , within the @xmath38 renormalization scheme .",
    "as mentioned before , the free energy density can be decomposed into three physically distinct parts @xcite @xmath98 up to order @xmath99 , only @xmath91 and @xmath93 contribute , and they are , in principle , perturbatively computable .",
    "these are the contributions from the energy intervals @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively , where the factorization scales @xmath102 and @xmath103 delimit the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) bounds of eqcd and satisfy the inequalities @xmath104 apart from fitting into this hierarchy , the factorization scales @xmath102 and @xmath103 are in principle arbitrary .",
    "the sum of the three contributions is independent of these scales , and @xmath105 is independent of @xmath102 . once @xmath102 and @xmath103 are fixed , each of the three contributions is a ( quasi)observable , i.e. , a quantity that is independent of the renormalization scale and scheme .",
    "we will show that the specific rscl - dependence of the available tps s for @xmath91 , @xmath106 , and @xmath93 is in fact consistent with rscl - independence of the full quantities @xmath91 , @xmath106 , and @xmath93 .",

    "this confirms additionally that the described separation forms a sound basis for the application of pa s .",
