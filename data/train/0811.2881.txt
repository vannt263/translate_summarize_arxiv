    "the wmap satellite has provided the scientific community with the highest resolution full - sky data of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) obtained to date ( @xcite ) .",
    "these data have allowed precise estimates of the temperature angular power spectrum @xmath2 up to the third doppler peak and thereby high precision measurements of many cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition to measuring the temperature fluctuations in the cmb with high sensitivity , wmap has also measured the polarization of the background radiation .",
    "but the polarization signal is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the temperature signal and is therefore measured with much lower sensitivity .",
    "the low signal - to - noise level makes it important to have a good understanding of systematic effects , in particular correlated noise properties .",
    "little is so far known about polarized foregrounds . for low signal - to - noise data , small errors in the understanding of systematic effects and foregrounds could lead to errors in the estimates of the polarization angular power spectra .    in the near future ,",
    "the situation with respect to cmb polarization will improve significantly .",
    "the planck satellite will take full - sky measurements of the polarized cmb sky ( @xcite ) and several other ground / balloon based experiments will follow up with high sensitivity observations in smaller regions of the sky ( the clover , quiet and quad experiments to mention a few ) .",
    "both esa and nasa are planning high sensitivity full - sky satellite borne experiments within the next 10 - 20 years .",
    "polarization measurements allow for estimation of three more angular power spectra , the @xmath3 power spectrum measuring the correlation between temperature and @xmath0 mode polarization as well as @xmath4 and @xmath5 which are the spectra of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes of polarization .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectra at large scales are used to estimate the reionization optical depth to high precision , a parameter to which the temperature power spectrum is not very sensitive .",
    "these spectra also give independent measurements of the other cosmological parameters estimated from the temperature power spectrum .",
    "this does not only serve as a consistency check , but also improves the statistical error bars on these parameters .",
    "finally the much weaker @xmath8 polarization power spectrum may at large scales be dominated by a signal arising from a background of gravitational waves which originated from inflation .",
    "this would be an important confirmation of the theory of inflation , and would as well give information about the detailed physics of the inflationary epoch . at smaller scales ,",
    "the @xmath8 spectrum is dominated by @xmath7 modes which have been converted to @xmath8 modes by gravitational lensing of large scale structure in the more recent universe .",
    "taking into account the huge amount of polarization data which will be available in the next 1 - 2 decades , as well as the important cosmological information contained in these data , it is clear that efficient data analysis tools will be necessary .",
    "while a large amount of data analysis techniques have been developed for analyzing cmb temperature data , much less attention has been given to analysis techniques for polarization data , also due to the lack of available high sensitivity observations .",
    "an important tool for the analysis of temperature data has been various kinds of spherical wavelets ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . indeed , in the last decade , wavelet methods have found applications in virtually all areas where statistical methods for cmb data analysis are required .",
    "just to mention a few examples , we recall foreground subtraction ( @xcite ) , point source detection ( @xcite ) , testing for non - gaussianity ( see @xcite ) , search for anisotropies @xcite , component separation ( @xcite ) , cross - correlation between cmb and large scale structure data ( @xcite ) , and many others .",
    "directional wavelets have been advocated by mcewen2,wiaux2 .",
    "the rationale for such a widespread interest can be explained as follows : cmb models are best analyzed in the frequency domain , where the behaviour at different multipoles can be investigated separately ; on the other hand , partial sky coverage and other missing observations make the evaluation of exact spherical harmonic transforms troublesome .",
    "the combination of these two features makes the time - frequency localization properties of wavelets most valuable .",
    "more recently , a new kind of wavelets has found many fruitful applications in the cmb literature , the so - called spherical needlets .",
    "spherical needlets were introduced in the functional analysis literature by @xcite , and then considered for the statistical analysis of spherical random fields by ( @xcite ) , with a view to applications to the statistical analysis of cmb  data , including estimation of the angular power spectrum , testing for gaussianity and bootstrap procedures .",
    "the related literature is already quite rich : applications to the analysis of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect by means of cross - correlation between cmb  and large scale structure data were given in @xcite ; a general introduction to their use for cmb data analysis is given in @xcite ; a discussion on optimal weight functions is provided in @xcite ; further applications include ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the extension to the construction of @xcite to the case of non - compactly supported weight functions is provided by @xcite , where the relationship with spherical mexican hat wavelets is also investigated , leading to the analysis of so - called _ mexican needlets . _ the stochastic properties of the corresponding mexican needlet coefficients are established in @xcite .    in this paper , we show how the scalar needlets which were applied to cmb temperature data can be extended to polarization using _ spin needlets . _ the latter were introduced in the mathematical literature by spin - mat _ _ ; _ _ they can be viewed as spin-2 wavelets designed for spin-2 fields on the sphere having the same properties when applied to cmb polarization fields as scalar needlets have when applied to cmb temperature fields . in particular",
    ", we shall show below that spin needlets enjoy both the localization and the uncorrelation properties that make scalar needlets a powerful tool for the analysis of cmb temperature data .",
    "the aim of this paper is then to introduce the spin-2 needlets , show how they can be applied to _",
    "q _ and _ u _ maps , and discuss some preliminary ideas for possible future statistical applications ( how these maps can be reconstructed from the spin-2 needlet coefficients , how _ ee _ and _ bb _ spectra may be obtained directly from these coefficients , tests of non - gaussianity and others ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we provide a quick review of standard ( scalar ) needlets and their main properties ; in section 3 we report the main results of @xcite , where spin needlets were first introduced and investigated from the mathematical point of view . in section 4",
    "we discuss a number of possible future applications to polarization data analysis ; in section 5 we provide a comparison with alternative approaches for the wavelet analysis of polarization data , while in section 6 we present some preliminary evidence on the reconstruction properties of spin needlets . some background material on spin spherical harmonics",
    "is given in the appendix .",
    "to ease comparisons with the spin needlets which we will describe later , we recall very briefly the construction of a needlet basis . the spherical needlet ( function )",
    "is defined as @xmath9here , @xmath10 is a direction @xmath11 on the sphere , and @xmath12 is the frequency ( multipole range ) of the needlet .",
    "we use @xmath13 to denote a set of _ cubature points _ on the sphere , corresponding to a given frequency @xmath12 . in practice",
    ", we will identify these points with the pixel centres in the healpix pixelization scheme @xcite .",
    "the cubature weights @xmath14 are inversely proportional to the number of pixels we are actually considering ( see @xcite , @xcite for more details ) ; we can take for simplicity @xmath15 where here and throughout the paper we shall take @xmath16 to be the number of cubature points @xmath17 needlets can then be viewed as a combination , analogous to convolution , of the projection operators @xmath18 with a suitably chosen window function @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the number @xmath1 appearing in the argument of the function @xmath21 is a parameter which defines the needlet basis , as will be discussed below .",
    "special properties of @xmath19 ensure that the needlets enjoy quasi - exponential localization properties in pixel space . formally , we must ensure that ( @xcite ) :    * * a1 * the function @xmath22 is positive in the range @xmath23,$ ] zero otherwise ; hence @xmath24 is positive in @xmath25 $ ] * * a2 * the function @xmath19 is infinitely differentiable in @xmath26 * * a3 * we have@xmath27    condition a1 can be generalized to cover functions such as @xmath28 , thus leading to so - called mexican needlets , see @xcite where advantages and disadvantages of such choice are also discussed . in the present formulation",
    ", a1 ensures the needlets have bounded support in the harmonic domain ; a2 is needed for the derivation of the localization properties , which we shall illustrate in the following section . finally , a3 ( _ the partition of unity property _ ) is needed to establish the reconstruction formula ( [ recfor ] ) .",
    "examples of constructions satisfying a1-a3 are given in @xcite .",
    "we shall now recall briefly some of the general features of needlets , which are not in general granted by other spherical wavelet constructions .",
    "we refer for instance to @xcite for more details and a general introduction for a cmb readership .",
    "briefly , we recall the following features :    \\a ) needlets do not rely on any tangent plane approximation ( compare sanz ) , and take advantage of the manifold structure of the sphere ;    \\b ) being defined in harmonic space , they are computationally very convenient , and inherently adapted to standard packages such as healpix ;    \\c ) they allow for a simple reconstruction formula ( see ( [ recfor ] ) ) , where the same needlet functions appear both in the direct and the inverse transform .",
    "this property is the same as for spherical harmonics but it is _ not _ shared by other wavelets systems ;    \\d ) they are quasi - exponentially ( i.e. faster than any polynomial ) concentrated in pixel space , see ( [ expine ] ) below ;    \\e ) they are exactly localized on a finite number of multipoles ; the width of this support is explicitly known and can be specified as an input parameter ( see ( [ needlets_expansion ] ) ) ;    \\f ) random needlet coefficients can be shown to be asymptotically uncorrelated ( and hence , in the gaussian case , independent ) at any fixed angular distance , when the frequency increases ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this capital property can be exploited in several statistical procedures , as it allows one to treat needlet coefficients as a sample of independent and identically distributed coefficients on small scales , at least under the gaussianity assumption .",
    "more precisely , random needlet coefficients are given by @xmath29here @xmath12 denotes the frequency of the coefficient and @xmath30 refers to the direction @xmath11 on the sky .",
    "the index @xmath30 can in practice be the pixel number on the healpix grid .",
    "it is very important to stress that , although the needlets do _ not _ make up an orthonormal basis for square integrable functions on the sphere , they do represent a _ tight frame .",
    "_ in general , a tight frame on the sphere is a countable set of functions which preserves the norm ; frames do not in general make up a basis , as they admit redundant elements .",
    "they can be viewed as the closest system to a basis , for a given redundancy , see @xcite for further definitions and discussion . in our framework",
    ", the norm - preserving property becomes @xmath31where @xmath32is the raw angular power spectrum of the map @xmath33 .",
    "( frame ) suggests immediately some procedures for angular power spectrum estimations and testing ( @xcite ) and is related to a much more fundamental result , i.e. the reconstruction formula @xmath34which in turn is a non - trivial consequence of the careful construction leading to ( [ partun ] ) .",
    "again , we stress that the simple reconstruction formula of ( [ recfor ] ) is typical of tight frames but does not hold in general for other wavelet systems .",
    "it is easy to envisage many possible applications of ( [ recfor ] ) when handling masked data .",
    "the following quasi - exponential localization property of needlets is due to @xcite and motivates their name :    for any @xmath35 there exists a positive constant @xmath36 such that for any point @xmath37 we have@xmath38    we recall that @xmath39 is just the geodesic distance on the unit sphere between the position @xmath10 and the position @xmath40 ( we recall in practice @xmath41 can be the pixel center of a healpix pixel @xmath30 ) .",
    "( [ expine ] ) is then stating that , for any fixed nonzero geodesic distance , the value of @xmath42 goes to zero faster than any polynomial ( _ quasi - exponentially _ ) in the parameter @xmath43 thus needlets achieve excellent localization properties in both the real and the harmonic domain . in @xcite , ( [ expine ] ) is extended to the case of a non - compactly supported but smooth @xmath44 thus covering also the mexican needlet case ( where @xmath45    from the stochastic point of view , the crucial uncorrelation properties for random spherical needlet coefficients were given in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , two forms of uncorrelation were established    * * p1 * whenever @xmath46 we have that @xmath47 , @xmath48 denoting the expected value * * p2 * for @xmath49 for any @xmath50 there exist a constant @xmath51 such that @xmath52    property p1 is a straightforward consequence of the localization properties for @xmath19 in the harmonic domain .",
    "property p2 is much more surprising , and does not follow by any means from the localization in pixel space ( expine ) ; indeed it is simple to provide examples of wavelet systems that satisfy ( [ expine ] ) , and still do not enjoy ( scacorrin ) ( see @xcite,@xcite ) . both these properties hold for any isotropic random field , without any assumption on its distribution ( i.e. gaussianity ) .    properties p1,p2 suggest that at high frequency , needlet coefficients can be approximated as a sample of identically distributed and uncorrelated ( independent , in the gaussian case ) coefficients , and this property opens the way to a huge toolbox of statistical procedures for cmb data analysis . in practice , numerical approximations and",
    "the presence of masked regions will entail that p1 and p2 will only hold approximately ; nevertheless , simulations have suggested that these properties do ensure a remarkable performance of needlets when applied to actual data from cmb experiments , see @xcite for further developments .",
    "throughout this paper , we shall assume that there exist a grid of _ cubature points _",
    "@xmath53 and a set of corresponding weights @xmath54 such that following discrete approximations of spherical integrals hold:@xmath55here @xmath56 are the spin spherical harmonics defined in the appendix . for the standard scalar case ,",
    "the existence of such points is well - known and provided by many different constructions , see for instance ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) , see also @xcite for further discussion and @xcite for extensions to the generalized needlets case . for the spin",
    "spherical harmonics we consider here , the validity of ( [ cubpoi ] ) is going to be investigated mathematically elsewhere .",
    "we stress , however , that even if equation ( [ cubpoi ] ) is not known , or the points @xmath13 are not explicitly given , then one can use any sensible collection of points and weights , and the results will still hold approximately ; in other words , our results below will continue to hold with minor numerical approximations when implemented on any package with a pixelization scheme such as healpix ( this issue is discussed rigorously and in greater detail in @xcite ) .",
    "spin needlets are defined as ( see ( @xcite ) for a complete mathematical treatment and more rigorous results)@xmath57a comparison between ( [ needlets_expansion ] ) and ( [ spinwav2 ] ) highlights immediately that spin needlets make up a natural extension of the ideas underlying the approach in the scalar case to the framework of a spin field .",
    "this deep link between the two constructions should not hide , however , some profound differences between @xmath42 and @xmath58 as mathematical objects . indeed , as recalled in the previous section @xmath42 is a standard scalar function which induces a linear map ( [ needproj ] ) leading from @xmath59 i.e. from a scalar quantity to a scalar quantity . on the contrary , @xmath60 induces a linear map leading from spin 2 quantities to spin 2 wavelet coefficients .",
    "the quantities in ( spinwav2 ) depend on the choice of the coordinate system for @xmath10 and @xmath40 these two coordinate systems may be chosen independently .",
    "if the coordinate system for @xmath10 is rotated , @xmath61 transforms like a spin 2 vector at @xmath62 while if the coordinate system at @xmath41 is rotated , @xmath63 transforms like a spin @xmath64 vector at @xmath65 @xmath66 has a precise mathematical status ( see ( @xcite ) ) as a linear map from spin 2 vectors at @xmath41 to spin two vectors at @xmath67 indeed , if @xmath68 is a spin 2 vector at @xmath41 , @xmath69 makes sense as a spin 2 vector at @xmath62 since the product of a spin @xmath64 vector and a spin @xmath70 vector at a point is a well - defined complex number , independent of choice of coordinates .",
    "( thus it would be more proper to write @xmath71 than @xmath72 in ( [ spinwav2 ] ) . )    as we shall show below the fact that @xmath63 is not a scalar function does not prevent useful applications for the reconstruction and testing on physically meaningful scalar quantities such as the angular power spectra @xmath73 we note that in the mathematical results of @xcite , the factor @xmath74 is replaced by @xmath75 this reflects the fact that the sequence @xmath76 represents the eigenvalues of the laplacian operator associated to spin spherical harmonics .",
    "however , since our main interest here is high - frequency asymptotics , and since @xmath77 for large @xmath78 , we use the simpler @xmath79 here to highlight the similarity with the usual presentation of scalar needlets .",
    "( antithetically , one may modify the definition of the latter by replacing @xmath79 with @xmath80 note indeed that @xmath81 provides the sequence of eigenvalues for the usual laplacian operator on the sphere .",
    "we refer to gmcw , gm2,gm1 for more discussion on this point . )    in figure [ fig : gnom ] we show the projection of @xmath63 on the plane for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we show the real and imaginary component as well as the modulus . in figure",
    "[ fig : psi ] we show how @xmath63 falls off with the distance from the center for @xmath82 and @xmath84 .",
    "as expected , we clearly see how @xmath63 falls of faster for higher values of @xmath12 and thus picking up smaller scales",
    ".    we shall now investigate the localization properties of ( [ spinwav2 ] ) .",
    "localization properties in multipole space are a straightforward consequence of the properties of the weight function @xmath85 localization properties in pixel space are much less straightforward and require rather sophisticated mathematical arguments .",

    "now consider the spin 2 fields @xmath89where we have introduced the complex - valued random coefficients@xmath90where @xmath91 denote , respectively , the spherical harmonics coefficients of the @xmath0,@xmath1 components of the polarization random field .",

    "an example of the reconstruction is shown in figure [ fig : reconstr ] . in the figure",
    "we show the relative difference in percent between the input and reconstructed q and u maps . outside the masked regions ,",
    "the difference is equal to the numerical noise obtained by doing a simple spherical harmonic transform followed by the inverse transform .",
    "close to the masked regions , there is a small area where the reconstruction error is larger .",
    "the size of this region will depend on the choice of @xmath1 . in this case",
    "@xmath82 which is a rather low value resulting in a relatively large region with larger error around the mask . note that most of these points still have reconstruction errors smaller than @xmath105 .",
    "we will discuss the accuracy of reconstruction in detail in a following paper .    as detailed in the previous section ,",
    "a capital property for the random needlet coefficients in the scalar case is asymptotic uncorrelation at any fixed angular distance ( for a smooth angular power spectrum ) , as the frequency parameter diverges ( @xmath106)@xmath107 a natural question is the extent to which this property may continue to hold in the spin case .",
    "the answer to this question is provided in @xcite , where it is shown that , under mild regularity conditions on the angular power spectra , for all @xmath50 there exist positive constants @xmath108 such that@xmath109    again , @xmath110 is a well defined scalar functions , despite the fact that @xmath111 are spin quantities that depend on the choice of coordinates for tangent planes .",
    "( [ spicorr ] ) suggests that the spin spherical needlet coefficients can be consistently used for angular power spectrum estimation and map reconstruction , as detailed in the following section ; in the scalar case , this argument is rigorously derived in ( bkmpaos ) , whereas for the spin situation we are concerned with here , we refer again to @xcite for a more complete mathematical analysis .",

    "i.e. starting from the approach of @xcite . we do not focus on this possibility here for brevity s sake .",
    "the purpose of this section is to provide some examples of the statistical applications which can be entertained by means of spin needlet coefficients .",
    "our purpose here is _ not _ to provide recipes which are ready - to - use for cmb data analysis - this certainly requires much more computational and analytical work to take into account the features of cmb maps : foregrounds , anisotropic noise , multichannel observations and many others .",
    "our purpose here is different : it is well - known how wavelets in the scalar case have proved to be a valuable instrument when dealing with a variety of data analysis issues .",
    "the discussion below suggests that spin needlets can be just as important . due to their specific nature as mathematical ( spin ) objects , these applications however require extra care , even in the idealistic circumstances we focus on here .",

    "this estimator was proposed in ( @xcite ) ; in pbm06 applications are also shown to the cross - correlation between cmband large scale structure data , in @xcite this estimator is extended to allow for the presence of observational noise , whereas in pietrobon08 the same approach is applied to search for features and asymmetries in cmb maps . in ( @xcite ) it is also shown that , in the gaussian case@xmath130where @xmath131 denotes convergence in distribution and @xmath132 a standard gaussian law . a result like",

    "the answer turns out to be positive , in the following sense .",

    "the presence of anisotropic noise is more interesting and can be dealt with along the lines of ( @xcite ) , i.e. by introducing weighted , rather than simple , averages of the squared needlet coefficients .",
    "the previous procedure allows one to estimate ( a binned form of ) the angular power spectra @xmath142 although this could be sufficient for some purposes , it is clear that for cmb applications we are interested , in general , in the estimation of @xmath143 and @xmath144 as separate quantities ; this is an issue to which we shall come back later in this section .      as a further statistical application",

    "the results in the present subsection suggest that spin needlets may allow for new statistical techniques when dealing with map reconstruction , even besides those allowed by wavelet methods in the scalar case .",
    "more generally , due to the poor localization properties of standard spherical harmonics , in the presence of masked regions and instrumental noise the construction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the coefficients @xmath186 ( see ( [ maskfc ] ) ) may not ensure satisfactory results ( recall @xmath187 need not be close to @xmath188 in any meaningful sense for partially observed polarization maps ) . on the other hand , in view of ( betapp ) the coefficients @xmath189",
    "are much less affected by masked regions , despite the fact that these quantities can themselves be viewed as linear combinations of the spherical harmonic coefficients .",

    "these developments are left for future work .",

    "the purpose of this section is to compare this approach with the one we suggested earlier to show that they are not equivalent .",
    "more precisely , we shall address the question about the localization properties of ( [ bjke ] ) , and investigate the effect of the presence of a masked region @xmath112 .",
    "recall that for scalar fields , when @xmath41 is  far enough  from @xmath112 we have the approximation@xmath209 in the presence of a masked region we obtain for instance@xmath210 d\\hat{\\gamma}\\right\\ } \\text { .}\\end{aligned}\\]]now note that @xmath211@xmath212 d\\hat{\\gamma}\\right\\ } y_{lm}\\left ( \\xi _ { jk}\\right)\\]]@xmath213 d\\hat{\\gamma}\\text { , }   \\label{nosmall}\\ ] ] where@xmath214    @xmath215    now the properties of ( [ wrowav ] ) , ( [ wrowav2 ] ) are still unknown and lack a rigorous mathematical exploration . indeed",
    "the function @xmath216 does not represent any form of projector on a proper subspace , as it is the case for the corresponding expression @xmath217 for the standard needlet construction in the scalar case .",
    "in fact looking at figure [ fig : altneed ] ( compare with figure [ fig : psi ] for the spin needlets ) we see that the shape of @xmath218 is such that at the origin the function has a zero , rather than a maximum , and then increases away from the center . in other words , while spin needlets enjoy a number of properties which are analogous to those in the scalar case ( good approximation properties in the presence of a mask ( see ( [ betapp ] ) above ) , tight frame property , asymptotic uncorrelation ) , these properties are not in general known to be shared by constructing wavelets on the scalar random fields @xmath219 after implementing the spherical harmonic transforms , in the presence of masked regions .",
    "we believe these remarks provide a clear rationale for our construction of spin needlets , which are directly embedded into the geometric structure of polarization random fields .",
