    "in recent years , the experimental progress in analyzing transport properties in double quantum dots @xcite has lead to the fabrication of double dot structures with only one electron in the whole system @xcite .",
    "this well - defined situation permits , although it is strictly speaking not necessary @xcite , to use quantum dot systems as quantum bits ( qubits ) . in order to define qubits in lateral quantum dot ( qd ) structures , the two degrees of freedom , spin and charge , are naturally used . for spin",
    "qubits @xcite , the information is encoded in the spin of a single electron in one quantum dot , whereas for the charge qubit @xcite the position of a single electron in a double dot system defines the logical states .",
    "similar ideas can also be applied to charge states in silicon donors @xcite .",
    "both realizations are interconnected : interaction and read - out@xcite of spin qubits are envisioned@xcite to be all - electrical and to make use of the charge degree of freedom .",
    "although the promises of spin coherence in theory@xcite and in bulk measurements @xcite are tremendous in the long run , it was the good accessibility of the _ charge _ degrees of freedom which lead to a recent break - through @xcite , namely the demonstration of coherent oscillations in a quantum dot charge qubit . in this experiment , three relevant decoherence mechanisms for these charge qubits have been pointed out : a cotunneling contribution , the electron - phonon coupling , and @xmath0-noise or charge noise in the heterostructure defining the dots .",
    "recent theoretical results @xcite predict that the cotunneling contribution can be very small , provided that the coupling between the dots and the connected leads is small .",
    "thus , cotunneling is not a _ fundamental _ limitation .",
    "this , however , means that initialization and measurement protocols different from those of ref .",
    "[ ] are favorable @xcite .",
    "other theoretical works @xcite already describe the electron - phonon interaction for a single charge qubit in a gaas / algaas heterostructure .",
    "moreover , also electronic nyquist noise in the gate voltages affects the qubit system @xcite .",
    "note that the physics of the electron - phonon coupling is different and less limiting in the unpolar material si @xcite , where the piezo - electric interaction is absent .",
    "in this article , we analyze the decoherence due to the electron - phonon coupling in gaas , which is generally assumed to be the dominant decoherence mechanism in a coupled quantum - dot setting .",
    "the recent experimental analysis shows that the temperature dependence of the dephasing rate in the experiment @xcite can be modeled with the spin - boson model and hence is compatible with this assumption @xcite .",

    "the former case is more likely @xcite and applies to crystals which can be regarded as perfect and linear over the size of the sample , whereas the latter case describes systems that are vstrained or disordered and double quantum dots in large geometrical separation .",

    "i.e. _ , the qds two and three in the chain , but we assume that the coupling is pinched off by applying appropriate gate voltages .",
    "the gray box between the qubits indicates that there is no tunneling between the qubits . ]    henceforth , we investigate the case of two identical qubits . due to the fact that the relevant distances are arranged along the @xmath19-direction",

    "the second exponential function in each line is the overlap between the two gaussian wavefunctions .",
    "this two - qubit bath coupling hamiltonian is quite remarkable , as it does not fall into the two standard categories usually treated in literature ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .  [ ] and references therein ) : on the one hand , there is clearly only one bath and each qubit couples to the bath modes with matrix elements of the same modulus , so the noise between the qubits is fully correlated . on the other hand ,",
    "the hamiltonian does _ not _ obey the familiar factorizing collective noise form @xmath22 .",
    "such a form would lead to a high degree of symmetry and thus protection from the noise coupling @xcite , however , the hamiltonian @xmath23 , eq . [ eq : initialelph ] , can not be factorized in such a bilinear form .",

    "the redfield tensor and the time evolution of the reduced density matrix are evaluated numerically to determine the decoherence properties of the system due to a weak electron - phonon coupling .",

    "it is also possible to take @xmath0-noise in the quantum dot system into account in the same way .",
    "the @xmath0-noise essentially determines the magnitude of the dephasing part of the decoherence .",
    "thus , it is in turn possible to impose for the zero frequency component @xmath37 the experimental value of the dephasing rates or a value from a microscopic model @xcite .",
    "however , in many cases it turns out to be non - markovian and/or non - gaussian , leading to non - exponential decay , which can neither be described by bloch - redfield theory nor parameterized by a single rate .    in order to compute the rates ,",
    "the electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian has first to be taken from the localized representation to the computational basis , which is straightforward . to compute bloch - redfield rates ,",

    "this structure can be understood as follows : the electron - phonon interaction averages out if the phonons are rapidly oscillating within a dot , _",
    "i.e. _ if the wavelength is much shorter than the dot size  this provides the high - frequency cutoff at @xmath61 . on the other hand",
    ", long - wavelength phonons do not contribute to decoherence between dots @xmath13 and @xmath62 , if the wavelength is much longer than their separation because then , the energy shift induced by the phonon displacement will only lead to a global phase .",
    "furthermore , we can approximate the leading order at low frequencies as @xmath63 this different power - laws @xmath64 to @xmath65 can be understood physically as illustrated in figure [ fig : diquad ] .",
    "`` even '' terms are the natural extension of the one - qubit electron - phonon coupling , adding up coherently between the two dots . in the `` odd '' channel ,",
    "the energy offset induced in one qubit is , for long wavelengths , cancelled by the offset induced in the other qubit .",
    "thus , shorter wavelenghts are required for finding a remaining net effect .",
    "an alternative point of view is the following : the distribution of the two charges can be parameterized by a dipole and a quadrupole moment .",
    "the `` even '' channel couples to the dipole moment of the charge configuration similar to the one - qubit case . the `` odd '' channel couples to the quadrupole moment alone ( see figure  [ fig : diquad ] ) .",

    "one generally would expect a different value of the distance between the dot centers in the qubits @xmath17 , when the tunneling coupling is varied .",

    "for the characterization of the quantum gate performance of this two - qubit system , it is necesssary to introduce suitable quantifiers .",
    "commonly , one employs the four gate quality factors introduced in ref .",

    "this can be achieved as follows : as we have seen , the hadamard gate is the step limiting the performance as during the hadamard the system is vulnerable against spontaneous emission at a rate @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the typical energy splitting of the single qubit .",
    "the duration of the hadamard , on the other hand , scales as @xmath170 .",
    "thus , the error probability and the purity decay reduces to @xmath171 .",
    "thus , by making the hadamard _ slower _ , _ i.e. _ , by working with small tunnel couplings between the dots , the gate performance can be increased .",
    "this works until ohmic noise sources , electromagnetic noise on the gates and controls , takes over .",
    "this is demonstrated nicely in fig .  [",
    "fig : phonons_sc ] , where the cnot gate for a modified hadamard opertation ( on the second qubit ) with @xmath172 is depicted .",
    "it is clearly observed that by decreasing the tunnel matrix element and by increasing the evolution time the decoherence is reduced and the threshold for the gate quality factors to allow universal quantum computation @xcite can be achieved .",
    "the gate quality of a cnot under decoherence has been studied in refs .  [ ] for standard collective and/or single - qubit noise in ohmic environments .",
    "the single - qubit case for charge qubits in gaas has been studied in ref .  [ ] with emphasis on non - markovian effects . even in view of this , and in view of the emphasis of the strong tunneling regime , that work arrives at the related conclusion that intrinsic phonon decoherence in this system can be limited .",
    "please note , that the approximations in the microscopic model give an upper bound of validity for the validity of effective hamiltonians as studied in ref .",
    "[ ] as descibed in refs .",
    "the work presented here is not affected by this restriction due to the emphasis of the case of small tunnel coupling .",
    "we have analyzed the influence of a phononic environment on four coupled quantum dots which represent two charge qubits .",
    "the effective error model resulting from the microscopic hamiltonian does not belong to the familiar classes of local or collective decoherence .",
    "it contains a dipolar and quadrupolar contribution with super - ohmic spectra at low frequencies , @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "the resulting decoherence is an intrinsic limitation of any gate performance .",
    "in particular , we have investigated within a bloch - redfield theory the relevant rates and the quality of a cnot gate operation .",
    "the two employed models of coupling the qubits to individual heat baths versus a common heat bath , respectively , yield quantitative differences for the gate qualifiers .",
    "still the qualitative behavior is the same for both cases .    within an analytical estimate for the purity loss",
    ", we have found that the decoherence plays its role mainly during the stage of the hadamard operation .",
    "the physics behind this is that during all the other stages , the bath couples to the qubits via a good quantum number .",
    "consequently , during these stages , the decoherence rates are dominated by the spectral density of the bath in the limit of zero frequency which for the present case of a super - ohmic bath vanishes .",
    "the results of our analytical estimate compare favorably with the results from a numerical propagation .",
    "the fact that on the one hand , the bath spectrum is super - ohmic , while on the other hand , the hadamard operation is the part that is most sensitive to decoherence , suggests to slow down the hadamard operation by using a rather small tunnel coupling . then , decoherence is reduced by a factor that is larger than the extension of the operation time . this finally results for the complete gate operation in a reduced coherence loss .",
    "thus , the gate quality is significantly improved for dots with weak tunnel coupling and can intrinsically meet the threshold for quantum error correction .",
    "our work was supported by dfg through sfb 631 .",
    "we thank stefan ludwig for hinting on the idea of working with small tunneling and peter hnggi for interesting discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we derive formulas for the evaluation of expressions of the type @xmath173 and @xmath174 in an ensemble average over all pure states @xmath175 .",
    "the state @xmath135 is an element of an @xmath176-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "decomposed into an arbitrary orthonormal basis set @xmath177 , it reads @xmath178 where the only restriction imposed on the coefficients @xmath179 is the normalization @xmath180 .",
    "hence the ensemble of pure states is fully described by the distribution @xmath181 we emphasize that @xmath182 is invariant under unitary transformations of the state @xmath135 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath183 is determined by the normalization @xmath184 of the distribution , where @xmath185 denotes integration over the real and the imaginary part of @xmath186 .",
    "the computation of the ensemble averages of the coefficients with the distribution is straightforward and yields @xmath187 using these expressions , we consequently find for the ensemble averages of the expressions @xmath173 and @xmath174 the results @xmath188 which have been used for deriving the purity decay from eq .  .",
    "while this averaging procedure is very convenient for analytical calculations , the numerical propagation can be performed with only a finite set of initial states . in the present case ,",
    "the averages are computed with the set of 36 states given after eq .  .",
    "in the present case , we have justified numerically that both averaging procedures yield the same results .",
    "thus , it is interesting whether this correspondence is exact .    for the case of one qubit , @xmath189 , the discrete set of states",
    "is given by the states @xmath190 where @xmath191 is chosen from the set of 6 vectors @xmath192 where @xmath193 .",
    "computing the averages for the states is now staightforward and shows that this discrete sample also fulfills the relations and .",
    "thus , we can conclude that for the computation of averages , both the discrete and the continuous sample .    for more than one qubit",
    ", however , arises a difference : while the sample of all pure states also contains entangled states , these are by construction excluded from set of direct products of the 6 one - qubit states .",
    "still our numerical results indicate that the different samples practically result in the same averages .",
