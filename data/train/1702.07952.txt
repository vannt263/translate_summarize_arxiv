    "cosmological observations coming from type ia supernovae @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite and the large scale structure @xcite , provide evidences that the universe is currently in an accelerating phase .",
    "this result is , in general , ascribed to the existence of a sort of dark energy ( de ) sector in the universe , an exotic energy source characterized by a negative pressure . at late times",
    ", the dark - energy sector eventually dominates over the cold dark matter ( cdm ) , and drives the universe to the observed accelerating expansion .",
    "the simplest candidate for de is the cosmological constant @xmath2 , which has an equation - of - state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "although this model is in agreement with current observations , it is plagued by some difficulties related to the small observational value of de density with respect to the expected one arising from quantum field theories ( the well known cosmological constant problem @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath2cdm paradigm , where cold dark matter ( cdm ) is considered into the game , may also suffer from the age problem , as it was shown in @xcite , while the present data seem to slightly favor an evolving de with the equation - of - state parameter crossing @xmath3 from above to below in the near cosmological past @xcite .    over the past decade",
    "several de models have been proposed , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , quintom @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite , holographic de @xcite , new agegraphic de @xcite , ricci de @xcite etc . on the other hand , there are also numerous models that induce an effective dark energy which arises from modifications of the gravitational sector itself , such as @xmath4 gravity @xcite ( this class is very efficient in verifying observational and theoretical constraints and explain the universe acceleration and phantom crossing @xcite ) , or gravity with higher curvature invariants @xcite , by coupling the ricci scalar to a scalar field @xcite , by introducing a vector field contribution @xcite , or by using properties of gravity in higher dimensional spacetimes @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .    a possibility that can be explored to explain the accelerated phase of the universe is to consider a theory of gravity based on the weitzenbck connection , instead of the levi - civita one , which deduces that the gravitational field is described by the torsion instead of the curvature tensor . in such theories ,",
    "the torsion tensor is achieved from products of first derivatives of tetrad fields , and hence no second derivatives appear .",
    "this _ teleparallel _",
    "approach @xcite , is closely related to general relativity , except for `` boundary terms '' @xcite that involve total derivatives in the action , and thus one can construct the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) , which is completely equivalent with general relativity at the level of equations but is based on torsion instead of curvature .",
    "teleparallel gravity possesses a number of attractive features related to geometrical and physical aspects @xcite .",
    "hence , one can start from tegr and construct various gravitational modifications based on torsion , with @xmath1 gravity being the most studied one @xcite .",
    "in particular , it may represent an alternative to inflationary models without the use of the inflaton , as well as to effective de models , in which the universe acceleration is driven by the extra torsion terms @xcite ( for a detailed review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the main advantage of @xmath1 gravity is that the field equations are 2nd - order ones , a property that makes these theories simpler if compared to the dynamical equations of other extended theories of gravity , such as @xmath4 gravity .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the implications of @xmath1 gravity to the formation of light elements in the early universe , i.e. to the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . on the other hand , we want to explore the possibility to constrain @xmath1 gravity by bbn observatio nal data .",
    "bbn has occurred between the first fractions of second after the big bang , around @xmath5 sec , and a few hundreds of seconds after it , when the universe was hot and dense ( indeed bbn , together with cosmic microwave background radiation , provides the strong evidence about the high temperatures characterizing the primordial universe ) .",
    "it describes the sequence of nuclear reactions that yielded the synthesis of light elements @xcite , and therefore drove the observed universe . in general , from bbn physics , one may infer stringent constraints on a given cosmological model .",
    "hence , in this work , we shall confront various @xmath1 gravity models with bbn calculations based on current observational data on primordial abundance of @xmath0 , and we shall extract constraints on their free parameters .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ revmodel ]",
    "we review @xmath1 gravity and the related cosmological models . in section [ bbnanal ]",
    "we use bbn calculations in order to impose constraints on the free parameters of specific @xmath1 gravity models .",
    "conclusions are reported in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "finally , in the appendix we summarize the main notions of bbn physics .",
    "let us briefly review @xmath1 gravity , and apply it in a cosmological framework . in this formulation ,",
    "the dynamical variable is the vierbein field @xmath6 , @xmath7 , which forms an orthonormal basis in the tangent space at each point @xmath8 of the manifold , i.e. @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the minkowsky metric with signature @xmath11 : @xmath12 . denoting with @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath14 the components of the vectors @xmath15 in a coordinate basis @xmath16 , one can write @xmath17 . as a convection , here we use the latin indices for the tangent space , and the greek indices for the coordinates on the manifold . the dual vierbein allows to obtain the metric tensor of the manifold , namely @xmath18 .    in teleparallel gravity",
    ", one adopts the curvatureless weitzenbck connection ( contrarily to general relativity which is based on the torsion - less levi - civita connection ) , which gives rise to the non - null torsion tensor : @xmath19 remarkably , the torsion tensor ( [ torsion ] ) encompasses all the information about the gravitational field .",
    "the lagrangian density is built using its contractions , and hence the teleparallel action is given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 , and where the torsion scalar @xmath22 reads as @xmath23 here , it is @xmath24 with @xmath25 the contorsion tensor which gives the difference between weitzenbck and levi - civita connections . finally , the variation of action ( [ action0 ] ) in terms of the vierbiens gives rise to the field equations , which coincide with those of general relativity .",
    "that is why the above theory is called the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) .",
    "one can now start from tegr , and generalize action ( [ action0 ] ) in order to construct gravitational modifications based on torsion .",
    "the simplest scenario is to consider a lagrangian density that is a function of @xmath22 , namely @xmath26},\\ ] ] that reduces to tegr as soon as @xmath27 .",
    "considering additionally a matter lagrangian @xmath28 , variation with respect to the vierbein gives the field equations @xcite @xmath29-     e_i^\\lambda { t^\\rho}_{\\mu\\lambda}{s_\\rho}^{\\nu\\mu}[1+f']\\nonumber\\\\     & &    + e^\\rho_i { s_\\rho}^{\\,\\,\\mu\\nu}(\\partial_\\mu t)f '' +      \\frac{1}{4}e^\\nu_i [ t+f]=4\\pi g\\,{e_i}^\\rho\\ , { \\theta_\\rho}^\\nu\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the energy - momentum tensor for the matter sector .    in order to explore the cosmological implications of @xmath1 gravity , we focus on homogeneous and isotropic geometry , considering the usual choice for the vierbiens , namely @xmath33 which corresponds to a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background metric of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the scale factor . equations ( [ torsion ] ) , ( [ lagrangian ] ) , ( [ s ] ) and ( [ contorsion ] ) allow to derive a relation between the torsion @xmath22 and the hubble parameter @xmath36 , namely @xmath37 hence , in the case of frw geometry , and assuming that the matter sector corresponds to a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath38 and pressure @xmath39 , the @xmath40 component of ( [ equations ] ) yields @xmath41+[t+f]=16\\pi g\\rho,\\ ] ] while the @xmath42 component gives @xmath43-(t - f)=16\\pi gp.\\ ] ] the equations close by considering the equation of continuity for the matter sector , namely @xmath44 .",
    "one can rewrite ( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ acceleration ] ) in the usual form @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47,\\\\      p_t&=&\\frac{1}{16\\pi g}\\ , \\frac{f - t f'+ 2t^2f''}{1+f'+ 2{t}f '' } \\ , , \\label{pt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the effective energy density and pressure arising from torsional contributions .",
    "one can therefore define the effective torsional equation - of - state parameter as @xmath48 in these classes of theories , the above effective torsional terms are responsible for the accelerated phases of the early or / and late universe @xcite .",
    "let us present now three specific @xmath1 forms , which are the viable ones amongst the variety of @xmath1 models with two parameters out of which one is independent , i.e which pass the basic observational tests @xcite .    1 .",
    "the power - law model by bengochea and ferraro ( hereafter @xmath49cdm ) @xcite is characterized by the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the two model parameters . inserting this @xmath1 form into friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) at present , we acquire @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the matter density parameter at present , and @xmath55 is the current hubble parameter value .",
    "the best fit on the parameter @xmath52 is obtained taking the @xmath56 observational data , and it reads @xcite @xmath57 clearly , for @xmath58 the present scenario reduces to @xmath2cdm cosmology , namely @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "2 .   the linder model ( hereafter @xmath61cdm ) @xcite arises from @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath39 ( @xmath64 ) the two model parameters . in this case",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) gives that @xmath65 the @xmath56 observational data imply that the best fit of @xmath64 is @xcite @xmath66 as we can see , for @xmath67 the present scenario reduces to @xmath2cdm cosmology .",
    "3 .   motivated by exponential @xmath4 gravity @xcite , bamba et . al . introduced the following @xmath1 model ( hereafter @xmath68cdm ) @xcite : @xmath69 with @xmath63 and @xmath39 ( @xmath64 ) the two model parameters . in this case",
    "we acquire @xmath70 for this model , and using @xmath56 observational data , the best fit is found to be @xcite @xmath71 similarly to the previous case we can immediately see that @xmath68cdm model tends to @xmath2cdm cosmology for @xmath67 .    the above @xmath1 models are considered viable in literature because pass the basic observational tests @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by two free parameters .",
    "actually there are two more models with two free parameters , namely the logarithmic model @xcite , @xmath72 and the hyperbolic - tangent model @xcite , @xmath73 nevertheless since these two models do not possess @xmath2cdm cosmology as a limiting case and since they are in tension with observational data @xcite , in this work we do not consider them .    finally , let us note that one could also construct @xmath1 models with more than two parameters , for example , combining the above scenarios .",
    "however , considering many free parameters would be a significant disadvantage concerning the corresponding values of the information criteria .",
    "in the section , we examine the bbn in the framework of @xmath1 cosmology . as it is well known ,",
