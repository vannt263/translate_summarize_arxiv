    "there are different theoretical models of this type of diffusion transport in long channels .",
    "one of these models can be found in @xcite .",
    "the essence of this model can be described as follows :    consider a long billiard channel with boundaries in the form of periodically repeated arcs slightly distorting the straight lines of boundaries .",
    "assume that the upper boundary of the channel is symmetric to the lower boundary .",
    "then the trajectory of motion of a billiard ball regarded as a material point obeying the ideal law of reflections from both boundaries can be studied in a channel of half width with symmetric reflections of the trajectory in the upper part of the channel into its lower part relative to the straight middle line of the channel .",
    "hence , the reflections from this middle line can be regarded as ideal .",
    "we approximately assume that the reflection from the lower part of the distorted boundary is realized in its linear approximation",

    "then , for @xmath519 and @xmath514 uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath309 the terms in ( [ eq:18 ] ) can be regarded uniformly distributed independent random variables .",

    "hence , the variance of the distribution of @xmath493 is equal to @xmath520 and nonlinearly depends on @xmath95 the deterministic diffusion in this billiard strip is anomalous .",
    "thus , there are two factors leading to the anomaly of the deterministic diffusion , namely , the quadratic dependence of the variance on distribution of the initial values even for the ideal billiard and the growth of coefficients of the terms in sum ( [ eq:18 ] ) leading to the cubic dependence of the variance of @xmath493 on @xmath74    we now make an important remark .",
    "we have studied the distribution of positions of the billiard ball after @xmath217 reflections .",
    "from the physical point of view , it is more important to get the distribution of the abscissas of billiard balls for large values of time @xmath521 because , for the the same period of time , the billiard ball makes different numbers of reflections for different trajectories .    in the ordinary billiards ,",
    "the time between two successive collisions is proportional to the covered distance .",
    "however , in the model of bouncing ball @xcite over an irregular surface , the time between two consecutive collisions is maximal if the points of consecutive reflections coincide . the problem of investigation of the anomalous deterministic diffusion in billiard channels as @xmath522 is of significant independent interest .      in the investigation of anomalous diffusion , we consider a differential equation with fractional derivatives .",
