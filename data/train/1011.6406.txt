    "typical textbook introductions of the standard model , e.g.  @xcite , emphasize at this point that the theory contains four massless gauge bosons and introduce the higgs mechanism so that one obtains a massive vector boson triplet and only one gauge boson , the photon , stays massless .",
    "such presentations reflect that the introduction of the higgs particle in electroweak interactions @xcite preceded our non - perturbative understanding of non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "in fact , massless gluons are not in the physical spectrum of ( [ sew ] ) .",
    "the self interaction due to the commutator ( [ f2 ] ) generates dynamically a non - perturbative mass gap , and the su(2 ) spectrum consists of massive glueballs .",
    "the lightest glueball can be used to set a mass scale .",
    "choosing for it , e.g. , 80 gev and coupling fermions is perfectly admissible .",
    "this does not constitute an ansatz for an electroweak theory by two reasons : the su(2 ) glueball spectrum is not what is wanted ( e.g. , masses of spin 0 and 2 states are lower than for spin 1 @xcite ) and fermions would be confined into boundstates , which is not the case . coupling a higgs field causes a deconfining phase transition , so that fermions are liberated , a photon stays massless and glueballs break up into elementary massive vector bosons .",
    "such a confinement - higgs transition has indeed been observed in pioneering lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) investigations  @xcite .",
    "the present paper introduces a different model for which a zero - temperature deconfined phase breaks the z@xmath3 center symmetry of su(2 ) and exhibits a massive vector boson triplet .",
    "the motivation for the action defined in the next section comes from properties of the u(1 ) polyakov loop .",
    "u(1 ) lgt confines fermions in the strong coupling limit of its lattice regularization @xcite . at weaker coupling",
    "it undergoes a transition into the coulomb phase as has been rigorously proven @xcite . in the coulomb phase the effective potential of the u(1 )",
    "polyakov loop @xmath4 assumes the mexican hat shape that is also characteristic for a complex higgs field in the broken phase .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_u1scatter1 ] by scatter plots of polyakov loops in the symmetric and in the broken phase . from the ring - like distribution in the broken phase the similarity with the behavior of a higgs field is evident ( details of the simulations for the figure",
    "are given in section  [ sec_num ] ) .",
    "we introduce a contribution to the action that is the alternating product of su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge matrices around a plaquette .",
    "it unifies su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge transformations into a local u(2 ) symmetry , which we take as the starting point of our presentation in section  [ sec_act ] .",
    "a gauge invariant regularization is obtained by coupling two scalar fields @xcite and leads to our model by freezing these fields up to their gauge transformations , here called london @xcite limit .",
    "the scalar fields can then be absorbed by extended gauge transformations , which were introduced and discussed in @xcite .",
    "some technical details of section  [ sec_act ] encountered in the investigation of the classical continuum limit are relegated to appendixes .    in section  [ sec_num ]",
    "we investigate the quantum field theory numerically in the lattice regularization .",
    "evidence for a su(2 ) deconfining phase transition , first observed in @xcite , and results for the particle spectrum are presented .",
    "a massless photon is found in both phases .",
    "noisy correlations ( as usual ) indicate massive su(2 ) glueballs , which appear to jump to unphysically high mass values in the deconfined phase . a beautiful strong signal for correlation functions of a massive vector boson triplet is seen in the deconfined phase , while it does not exist on the confined side .",
    "summary , outlook and conclusions follow in the final section  [ sec_sum ] .",
    "introducing gauge fields is often motivated by promoting a global symmetry of matter fields to a local one .",
    "let us assume a global u(2 ) symmetry : @xmath5 the @xmath6 part of the free fermion lagrangian breaks ( [ g ] ) as a local symmetry .",
    "this is overcome by coupling to gauge fields , whose transformation behavior cancels the unwanted contributions out . in the lattice regularization",
    "the relevant coupling reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a vector of integers , @xmath9 is the unit vector in @xmath10 direction , @xmath11 the lattice spacing ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are introduced as u(1 ) and su(2 ) coupling constants . the precise definition of the fermions ( see for instance @xcite ) in eq .",
    "( [ upsi ] ) is accomplished by @xmath16 and irrelevant in our context as we discuss only their gauge transformations .",
    "the classical continuum limit is for @xmath17 obtained from @xmath18 contributions , whose sum becomes an integration over space .    in the lattice formulation",
    "it is obvious that the local gauge transformations @xmath19 will be absorbed by imposing the transformations @xmath20 on the vector fields , provided that their contributions to the action are gauge invariant .",
    "this is ( for instance ) fulfilled for the wilson action @xmath21 where the sums are over all plaquettes and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are oriented products of gauge matrices around the plaquette loop .",
    "e.g. , for a @xmath23 plaquette in the @xmath24 , @xmath25 plane : @xmath26\\,.\\ ] ] as it turns out to be convenient , we represent here and in the following u(1 ) phase factors by diagonal @xmath27 matrices with @xmath28 ( [ sew ] ) and @xmath29 ( [ uv ] ) related by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath27 unit matrix .",
    "the electromagnetic contribution to the lagrangian ( [ sew ] ) reads then @xmath32 the equations @xmath33 relate @xmath34 and @xmath35 of ( [ sgauge ] ) to the couplings @xmath14 and @xmath15 of  ( [ uv ] ) .",
    "more lattice actions that give the classical continuum limit ( [ sew ] ) are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "there is an asymmetry in the way the gauge transformations work : a transformation of either the u(1 ) or the su(2 ) matrices implies the corresponding transformation for the fermion field , while there is no such effect on the other gauge field .",
    "another remarkable @xcite feature of the action ( [ sgauge ] ) is that it is additive and not multiplicative in the u(1 ) and su(2 ) fields .",
    "changing also the fermion terms ( [ upsi ] ) to additive @xmath36 the @xmath18 contributions to the classical @xmath17 limit remain unchanged , while the gauge transformations become symmetrical in all fields , because eq .  ( [ gu ] ) and ( [ gv ] ) have to be replaced by local u(2 ) transformations @xmath37 which we call _ extended gauge transformations _ while reserving the notation _ gauge transformations _ for their conventional version .",
    "the gauge part ( [ sgauge ] ) of the action is invariant under local u(2 ) transformations . after a generic transformation former u(1 ) and",
    "su(2 ) matrices will both be in u(2 ) and their identification as u(1 ) or su(2 ) has become converted into constraints on the gauge manifold .",
    "the special gauge in which they are actually in u(1 ) and su(2 ) , i.e. eq .  ( [ uv ] ) holds , will be called _ diagonal gauge_. in this gauge the u(1 ) part is not only diagonal but proportional to the unit matrix . with reference to the existence of this gauge",
    "we keep the u(1 ) and su(2 ) matrix identifications .",
    "it is only in the limit @xmath46 that the coupling constant @xmath50 together with the dimensions of the scalar fields becomes the dimensionless coupling @xmath51 of  ( [ sint ] ) ( recall that the dimensionless lattice field @xmath40 is related to the physical scalar field @xmath52 by @xmath53 @xcite ) .",
    "this is opposite to what happens in the su(2 ) higgs model where the interaction between scalar field and su(2 ) field , as for instance given in @xcite , is proportional to @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 su(2 ) . here",
    "@xmath58 is dimensionless , and fixing the gauge in the london limit to @xmath59 leads to the gauge symmetry breaking contribution @xmath60 where @xmath61 acquires the dimension of the @xmath62 scalar fields .    the extended gauge transformations ( [ agu ] ) and ( [ agv ] ) restore the transformation ( [ phigauge ] ) without using scalar fields by absorbing the @xmath63 phase factor into the @xmath64 and the su(2 ) transformation @xmath65 into the @xmath66 field .",
    "this requires the action ( [ sint ] ) , or similar , and is not possible in the london limit ( [ su2broken ] ) of the higgs model .",
    "before investigating the quantum field theory ( [ sint ] ) numerically , we consider the classical continuum limits of ( [ sint ] ) and  ( [ sscalar ] ) .",
    "the classical lagrangian is expected to be the effective theory at energy scales much larger than the masses of the model . in the limit",

    "the local u(2 ) transformations do not destroy the fact that @xmath29 describes just an electromagnetic field .",
    "any @xmath86 field is gauge equivalent to one in the diagonal gauge for which @xmath29 is proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "consequently , @xmath87 stays always diagonal and the @xmath88 matrices can be omitted in  ( [ fag ] ) .",
    "similarly , we extend gauge transformations of a su(2 ) field @xmath89 by a phase . the gauge covariant derivative is @xmath90 and the extended gauge transformations of @xmath2 are @xmath91 equations ( [ dpsig ] ) to ( [ lapsi ] ) carry simply over by replacing all labels @xmath11 by  @xmath92 .",
    "an electroweak lagrangian of the type @xmath93 allows one to add ( [ lint ] ) .",
    "under extended gauge transformations ( [ ag ] ) for @xmath29 and ( [ bg ] ) for @xmath2 , the @xmath94 tensor ( [ fint ] ) transforms according to @xmath95 so that @xmath96 is invariant . the algebra for ( [ fintg ] ) is given in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "as it is tedious and not very enlightening to calculate the classical continuum limit of the action ( [ sscalar ] ) with scalar fields , we relegate its discussion to appendix  [ appb ] .",
    "the essence is caught by a much simpler gauge invariant classical interaction with two scalar fields , which reduces also to ( [ lint ] ) in the london limit , but has a lattice regularization that differs from  ( [ sscalar ] ) .",
    "let us introduce the scalar fields @xmath97 with @xmath44 .",
    "it is then easy algebra to show that the field tensor @xmath98 reduces by gauge fixing in the london limit to @xmath99 ( [ fint ] ) in the diagonal gauge , so that @xmath100\\ ] ] becomes a gauge invariant extension of ( [ lint ] ) .",
    "pure u(1 ) lgt with the wilson action has at @xmath101 a phase transition from its confined into its coulomb phase .",
    "presumably the transition is weakly first order as first reported in @xcite .",
    "we have calculated lattice averages of u(1 ) polyakov loops @xmath4 by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations on a @xmath102 lattice with periodic boundary conditions with a statistics of 10,000 sweeps for equilibration and 160,000 sweeps with measurements .",

    "scatter about zero , while they form a ring in the broken ordered phase .",
    "as the transition happens at zero temperature , this holds on a symmetric lattice for polyakov loops winding in any one of the four directions through the torus ( ordered starts are used to avoid metastabilities of the mc algorithm ) .    in the following mc simulations with the plaquette action @xmath105",
    "are performed , where @xmath106 is defined by ( [ sgauge ] ) and @xmath107 by ( [ sint ] ) .",
    "we use lattice units @xmath108 in this section .",
    "the partition function of the mc calculation @xmath123 is invariant under extended @xmath124 gauge transformation ( [ agu ] ) and ( [ agv ] ) .",
    "the jacobian determinants of both @xmath125 and @xmath126 are one and the action ( [ smodel ] ) is by construction invariant .",
    "u(1 ) and su(2 ) wilson loops are invariant operators as the u(2 ) transformations drop out in the trace . as usual",
    "@xcite their physical interpretation can be derived by imagining a coupling to static quarks .",
    "in addition to the normal wilson loops traces of corresponding mixed products of u(1 ) and su(2 ) matrices are also invariant , but we make no use of them in the following .    with normalization of the integration over the @xmath124 measure to one , the identity @xmath127 holds under extended gauge transformations .",
    "this integration can easily be added to the updates : at site @xmath128 all matrices on links emerging at @xmath128 will be transformed according to @xmath129 and all matrices on links ending at @xmath128 according to @xmath130 the acceptance rate of such updates is 100% as no change in the value of the action is implied .",
    "the unusual feature is that the integration measure of the vector fields @xmath109 and @xmath131 in the functional integral ( [ zmodel ] ) is not identical with the gauge measures in ( [ gint ] ) .",
    "however , for gauge transformations of scalar and fermion fields we are used to this and there appears no strong argument against having a distinction of these measures also for vector fields ( calling them gauge fields may have added to the expectation that functional and gauge measures are the same ) .",
