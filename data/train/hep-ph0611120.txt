    "interestingly , these one - chain approximation results are finite and continuous at @xmath296 where the coupling has a landau pole , and this property is underwritten by relations between ir ( @xmath237 ) and uv ( @xmath238 ) physics , where @xmath236 refers to the momentum flowing through the bubble chain .",
    "there are corresponding relations between ir and uv renormalon residues .",
    "these connections are more transparent in the language of the one - chain skeleton expansion of eq.(99 ) in which they are seen to correspond to continuity of the characteristic function @xmath316 and its derivatives .",
    "perturbative and non - perturbative ambiguities which contribute an imaginary part may also be written in terms of the characteristic function .",
    "presumably the one - chain approximation is far too crude to describe the real non - perturbative infra - red behaviour of qcd observables , but is interesting that it does have the properties of continuity and finiteness that must be possessed by the true all - orders result",
