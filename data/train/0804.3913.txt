    "one of the basic questions in the study of phenomenological properties of string theories concerns the origin of supersymmetry breakdown . a dynamical mechanism like ( hidden sector )",
    "gaugino condensation @xcite can explain a hierarchically small scale for the gravitino mass @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the renormalization group invariant scale of the hidden sector gauge group and @xmath2 is the planck mass .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , derendinger , kounnas and petropolous ( dkp ) identified a new solution in the framework of the heterotic theory with an even stronger ( quadratic ) suppression of the gravitino mass @xmath3 it was discovered in the study of moduli stabilization in the @xmath4 orbifold with ns - ns 3-form and geometric fluxes .",
    "while these fluxes ( combined with the gaugino condensate ) are sufficient to stabilize all moduli in many cases , they fail to do so in the new dkp - solution with the double suppression of the gravitino mass .",
    "two more moduli have to be stabilized and it remains to be seen whether the doubly suppressed solution survives in the process of moduli stabilization .    in the present paper",
    ", we try to study the new solution of dkp in a set - up with all moduli fixed , define the criteria for the appearance of this solution and analyze its phenomenological properties . in the next chapter we shall present the model of dkp in its original form and notation .",
    "chapter 3 addresses some shortcomings of the model due to the presence of unfixed moduli .",
    "we conclude that it is mandatory to have all moduli fixed before a meaningful analysis of the phenomenological properties can be performed . in chapter 4",
    "we list the basic requirements for the appearance of dkp - like models and define a benchmark model where questions like the fine - tuning of the vacuum energy and the emerging pattern of the soft supersymmetry breaking term can be addressed . for this class of models",
    "we are again led to a kind of mirage pattern as previously identified in @xcite .",
    "chapter 5 is devoted to applications of this new solution .",
    "this includes ( most importantly ) scenarii with a tev - scale gravitino and a condensation scale as large as a grand unified scale @xmath5 or the compactification scale @xmath6 .",
    "other possible applications include the generation of the @xmath7-term @xmath8 in models with a small gravitino mass , as well as cosmological applications concerning a quintessential axion and the question of axionic inflation .",
    "the analysis and the notation of this section will follow @xcite .",
    "we will start considering one important phenomenological requirement , namely , moduli stabilization . to understand",
    "whether moduli are stabilized or not we have to check the structure of the scalar potential of the theory , so , as a first step , we dedicate this section to the discussion of the possible terms which can appear in the superpotential .",
    "we will consider two contributions : fluxes and gaugino condensates .",
    "we will confine our discussion to the @xmath4 orbifold compactification of heterotic strings .",
    "this compactification setup leads to seven main moduli ( including the string dilaton ) and @xmath9 supersymmetry .",
    "the effective supergravity is the @xmath4 projection of the @xmath10 theory with sixteen supercharges .",
    "extended supersymmetry is not consistent with our phenomenological requirements , since chiral fermions can exist in four dimensions only when @xmath11 .",
    "for this reason it is mandatory to reduce the amount of supersymmetry and the orbifold truncation does this .",
    "fluxes are introduced by gauging the @xmath10 supergravity @xcite : the parameters of the sugra theory are the `` gauging structure constants '' and these are also the flux parameters .",
    "the identification of the moduli depends on the theory under consideration . for heterotic strings on @xmath12 ,",
    "the moduli are the dilaton - axion superfield @xmath13 , the volume moduli @xmath14 and the complex structure moduli @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the index @xmath17 refers to the three complex planes left invariant by @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath18 supersymmetric complexification for these fields is defined naturally in terms of the geometrical moduli @xmath19 ( nine fields ) , the string dilaton @xmath20 and the components @xmath21 ( three fields ) and @xmath22 of the antisymmetric tensor .",
    "the indices @xmath23 run over the internal space and @xmath24 are the minkowski indices .",
    "explicitly , the metric tensor restricted to the plane @xmath17 is @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the weyl rescaling to the four dimensional einstein frame is @xmath28 .",

    "the first step is establishing which components of a @xmath33-form survive the @xmath4 truncation . with this purpose in mind ,",

    "these fluxes are characterized by real constants with one upper curved index and two lower antisymmetric curved indices @xmath53 these constants must satisfy the jacobi identities of a lie group , @xmath54 , and the additional consistency condition @xmath55 @xcite .    in agreement with the @xmath48 orbifold projection",

    "the possible structures in the superpotential are @xmath32 dependent in the form @xmath59 before proceeding with the analysis , one comment regarding the compactification manifold is necessary .",
    "when we switch on fluxes , we are led to heterotic theory on non - calabi - yau manifold . in a modern language",
    "we can say that e.g. `` half - flat '' manifolds are exploited implicitly in the dkp model .",
    "the existence of these manifolds is strongly suggested by type ii mirror symmetry and , recently , heterotic theory on half - flat has been discussed in @xcite , where a gukov - type formula has been obtained for the superpotential induced by fluxes . in other words ,",
    "the flux contribution to the dkp - superpotential can be understood as a gukov - type formula on a half - flat manifold .",
    "it is also important to recall that , in the heterotic theory , @xmath60 and @xmath52 fluxes can never generate an @xmath13-dependent perturbative @xmath9 superpotential .",
    "consequently , if our intention is to stabilize _ all _ moduli , including the dilaton , some additional stabilizing contribution must be included .",
    "for this reason we will therefore consider nonperturbative effects , in particular , gaugino condensation . for further details on fluxes in heterotic theory the reader is referred to the literature @xcite .      in a general supergravity theory with khler potential @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the moduli ,",

    "if this requirement is fulfilled we can define a variable @xmath106 ( real function of @xmath103 ) as @xmath107 which can be consistently taken to be of order one since @xmath108 is small and @xmath109 is of order one . as we shall discuss later",
    ", this requires a certain amount of fine tuning for @xmath110 .",
    "the gravitino mass is given by @xcite : @xmath111 for generic plane symmetric situations .",
    "in the special case @xmath112 and @xmath113 and within the above approximations , the result is @xmath114 the gravitino mass scales as @xmath115 and this is due to the absence of flux - induced @xmath13-term in the heterotic superpotential .",
    "it is relevant to discuss which values of the parameters will give a small @xmath108 .",
    "if we consider a planckian scale @xmath7 then @xmath116 is necessary to have a small @xmath108 and to achieve a reasonable value of @xmath117 .",
    "eq.([eqn : dkpgravitino ] ) written in the form shows that the @xmath13 modulus is stabilized through the presence of the condensate . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is not a `` racetrack '' mechanism proper @xcite because we only have one condensate .",
    "however , the condensate enters into the superpotential in a rather complex way and several terms are added together , so , as far as our model is concerned , it gives a result that otherwise can only be achieved by a racetrack mechanism .",
    "up to now the stabilization of the moduli can be summarized as follows :    * @xmath13 can be stabilized at an acceptable value , * @xmath50 is real and stabilized through fluxes , * @xmath118 is fixed as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath119 from eq.([eqn : dkpstationary2 ] ) , * @xmath78 and @xmath120 are flat directions and thus not stabilized .",
    "the problematic aspect of the dkp - strategy is the appearance of unfixed @xmath32 moduli .",
    "it is a consequence of the restricted no - scale ansatz eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dkpminkowski ] ) and it leads to a situation with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this ansatz requires @xmath123 in a situation where not all moduli are fixed .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this strategy is the most appropriate one since the goal of the procedure is a vanishing @xmath124 after fixing all moduli .",
    "one way to proceed is the application of the old local no - scale idea , where one assumes corrections to the khler potential which fix the remaining moduli while keeping @xmath125 .",
    "thus to remove the flat directions we will modify the khler potential demanding the flatness condition ( @xmath126 ) only _ locally _ @xcite . in the remaining part of this section",
    "we will focus on this point ( following the notation in @xcite )",
    ". the final outcome will be the stabilization of all moduli .",
    "for the flatness condition to be around point @xmath127 in @xmath128 ( the positive kinetic energy domain @xmath129 ) , we demand @xmath130 where the real function @xmath131 satisfies the conditions @xmath132 and @xmath133 the general solution of eq.([eqn : ode ] ) is @xmath134 with the positive kinetic energy domain defined by @xmath135 the corresponding scalar potential is positive definite in @xmath136 , provided that @xmath137 as well as @xmath138 as can be seen from its analytic expression @xmath139}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the khler correction is designed in such a way that it vanishes at @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the presence of @xmath140 in the scalar potential deforms its shape only outside @xmath127 .",
    "let us for concreteness consider @xmath141 and apply the analysis to @xmath142 .",
    "as evident from eq.([eqn : kahlercorrection ] ) we obtain @xmath143 and the positivity condition eq.([eqn : positivity ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the scalar potential exhibits a local minimum at @xmath127 .",
    "fig.[fig : tdir ] illustrates the scalar potential in the complex @xmath78 plane .",
    "a similar procedure can be exploited to remove the @xmath120 flat direction .",
    "note that due to the khler correction @xmath140 the khler manifold no longer exhibits the @xmath144 symmetry . in the minimum @xmath127 , however , the stabilization of @xmath13 does not clash with the stabilization of @xmath78 and @xmath120 since in @xmath127 the correction @xmath140 and its derivatives vanish .     displayed in the complex plane . ]",
    "displayed in the complex plane . ]",
    "since we have stabilized now all the moduli in the presence of broken supersymmetry , we can start to analyze explicitely the resulting pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking terms .        to obtain a phenomenologically attractive gravitino mass we shift the position of the minimum in the @xmath13 direction to @xmath147 .",
    "this corresponds , by reversing the rescaling eq.([eqn : rescaling ] ) , to the gauge group @xmath148 .",

    "we obtain @xmath154 where the gravitino mass is given by @xmath155 .",
    "remarkably the local no - scale structure exploited to stabilize the flat directions does not modify the result @xmath121 . at first sight ,",
    "the result @xmath156 might be surprising since the @xmath32 moduli have been considered in a strongly asymmetric way in the superpotential and during the process of stabilization .",
    "however , we must remember that @xmath157 was one of the conditions to obtain a minkowski ( no - scale ) solution and , once exploited in the evaluation of the @xmath158 terms , it will give us the very symmetric configuration @xmath156 .      for the evaluation of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms",
    "we include the contribution of matter fields in the khler potential .",
    "we will focus our attention on @xmath159 symmetric orbifolds . if we denote collectively the @xmath32 and the @xmath50 moduli by @xmath160 , where e.g. @xmath161 with @xmath162 , the khler potential becomes @xcite @xmath163 with @xmath164 being the observable matter fields and @xmath165 are the so - called _",

    "we have really a no - scale configuration for the soft terms : the scalar masses , the trilinear couplings and the gaugino masses are vanishing .      in the previous section we obtained vanishing _ tree - level _ soft terms . to construct a realistic model we can take into account quantum effects like anomaly mediation @xcite and/or threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic function @xcite .",
    "however , since loop corrections exceedingly complicate the evaluation of the soft terms , we will dedicate the next section entirely to the discussion of a simple benchmark model encompassing the main features of the dkp set - up .",
    "in this section instead , we will summarize the modifications induced by threshold corrections in our model ( in the gauge kinetic function , in the superpotential and in the khler potential ) .",
    "the detailed structure of quantum corrections depends on the model we consider ( the case of @xmath48 orbifold model is discussed in @xcite ) and usually these corrections are complicated functions of the moduli @xcite .",
    "however for our purposes it will be sufficient to consider the following modification to the gauge kinetic function ( see @xcite ) @xmath174 where the explicit @xmath32 dependence will lead us to nonvanishing gaugino masses and @xmath175 is a small number that we now specify .",
    "the one - loop gauge coupling constant is given by the real part of a gauge kinetic function of the form @xcite @xmath176 where @xmath88 is a beta function coefficient and the mixing with coefficient @xmath177 generalizes the green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "for large @xmath32 we have @xmath178 , and in our @xmath48 orbifold model @xmath179 @xcite . in this way",
    "we recover the simpler structure of eq.([eqn : oneloopf ] ) .",
    "the superpotential of the model contains the _ nonperturbative _ factor @xmath180 which depends crucially on the value of the gauge coupling constant @xmath181 . at loop - level @xmath181",
    "is not specified _ only _ by the dilaton field @xmath13 , but also by the @xmath32 field .",
    "for this reason we will substitute the @xmath13 field in the superpotential with the 1-loop corrected expression @xmath182 ( see above ) .    in case of a pure yang - mills theory ,",

    "this mixing of @xmath13 and @xmath32 will induce soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the observable sector , including nontrivial gaugino masses .",
    "of course , the mixing will also induce a shift in the location of the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "such a shift will generically lead to a nonvanishing value of the vacuum energy as well .",
    "a further fine tuning is required to obtain a suitable value for @xmath124 .",
    "a complete treatment of the effective potential is rather complicated and will not be discussed here in detail .",
    "we shall rather adopt a strategy different from dkp in order to simplify the discussion .",
    "as we have seen , we can fix the remaining moduli and keep vanishing vacuum energy .",
    "the strategy adopted so far , however , has several drawbacks .",
    "the corrections to the khler potential in eq.([stabilizingphi ] ) are chosen ad hoc and there is no convincing theoretical justification ( e.g. from string theory considerations ) .",
    "the procedure is such that @xmath121 is frozen in and we have problems with the soft supersymmetry breaking terms , e.g. vanishing tree level gaugino masses .",
    "it is also well known that radiative corrections spoil the no - scale structure . as we have seen above ,",
    "generically these corrections induce a mixing of @xmath13 and @xmath32 and therefore @xmath186 as well as a nonvanishing contribution to @xmath124 .",
    "thus the vacuum energy has to be tuned a second time .",
    "we therefore conclude that the no - scale strategy of dkp is not necessarily the most appropriate one .",
    "one should first fix all moduli ( without intermediate assumptions on @xmath124 ) and then care about ( the tuning of ) the vacuum energy once and for all .",
    "this is what we are trying to do in the next chapter .",
    "the question is whether the observed double suppression of the gaugino condensate can be realized in this more general set - up as well , or whether it is tied to the specific no - scale ansatz eq.([eqn : dkpminkowski ] ) adopted by dkp .",
    "let us recapitulate the basic ingredients needed for the double suppression . the obvious requirement is the absence of @xmath13 in the perturbative superpotential ( only nonperturbative contributions of the form @xmath187 are present ) which is automatically fulfilled in the heterotic theory .",
    "we also need some tuning of parameters as explained in the last section ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "one should also note that terms with @xmath187 in the superpotential need to be multiplied by non - trivial functions of the @xmath32 moduli ( a generic result in the heterotic theory originating in world sheet instanton effects @xcite ) .",
    "last but not least we need a superpotential with terms that allow large masses for the @xmath32 moduli , although the classical superpotential does not include quadratic terms in @xmath32 ( but only constant and linear terms ) .",
    "this requirement has been discussed in detail in @xcite both for the heterotic and the type iib case , and it strongly relies on the existence of the complex structure moduli . once these have been fixed and integrated out we are left with an effective superpotential @xmath189 which could include terms quadratic ( and higher order ) in @xmath32 .",
    "of course , one could also consider more general compactification than the @xmath48 orbifolds considered by dkp that allow for more general superpotentials . in any case , the above requirements seem to be quite easily fulfilled in the framework of heterotic string theory .",
    "we thus consider the heterotic theory with @xmath13 , @xmath32 , and @xmath50 moduli as given in dkp . in a first step we use fluxes to fix the @xmath50 moduli without breaking supersymmetry .",
    "the @xmath50 moduli become heavy and can be integrated out leading to an effective superpotential @xmath190 where @xmath13 only appears through the condensate @xmath187 . the simplest form to realize",
    "the doubly suppressed solution of dkp then reads : @xmath191 where we dropped numerical coefficients for the moment .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath32 then relates @xmath192 and @xmath193 , as desired .",
    "the mild fine - tuning of dkp ( @xmath188 ) has a counterpart in our benchmark model : the coefficient of a possible term linear in @xmath32 has to be small , otherwise the double suppression would be spoiled .",
    "thus this simple model captures all the aspects of the dkp - model with one exception : the @xmath13 modulus is not yet fixed .",
    "in fact , we are faced with a potential that shows run - away behavior for @xmath194 , and the potential is positive .",
    "therefore we have to find a mechanism to fix @xmath13 and tune the vacuum energy to an acceptable value .",
    "both problems can be solved simultaneously by adopting the `` downlifting strategy '' explained in @xcite .",
    "this will be explicitely worked out in the remainder of this section .      given the guidelines in the previous section",
    "the purpose of this part is to construct and analyze a simpler framework covering the key features of the dkp model .",
    "the fact that the only @xmath13-dependence of the superpotential in the dkp model is encoded in the gaugino condensate , can be identified as the crucial requirement for the double suppression .",
    "we would like to express the complicated form of the superpotential eq.([eqn : dkpsuper ] ) in a more transparent language . in what follows",
    "we consider @xmath13 , @xmath32 and @xmath50 moduli .",
    "after the @xmath50 moduli have been integrated out we assume the effective superpotential to be of the form @xmath195 where @xmath196,  ,@xmath197 and @xmath198 are real constants . for the case of simplicity we are considering a real dilaton field @xmath13 and one single real khler modulus @xmath32 .",
    "we fine - tune the coefficient @xmath199 to be small ( see discussion above ) such that the term linear in @xmath32 becomes negligible .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath32 modulus @xmath200 reads @xmath201 for eq.([eqn : eom ] ) to be satisfied , @xmath32 has to be small which implies that @xmath202 and higher powers of @xmath32 can be safely neglected in eq.([eqn : effsuper ] ) . from the equation of motion eq.([eqn : eom ] ) one obtains @xmath203 consequently we can integrate out the @xmath32 field and end up with the effective superpotential @xmath204 this is exactly the double suppression as obtained in the dkp model . at this stage , however , the dilaton is not yet stabilized since the scalar potential from eq.([eqn : effsuper2 ] ) shows a run - away behavior . the remaining task to perform",
    "is to stabilize the dilaton and assure a reasonable vacuum energy .",
    "as was recently shown @xcite these two operations can be done economically in one step .    following the discussion of @xcite we consider the impact of hidden sector matter through the interaction with the effective theory obtained after integrating out @xmath50 and @xmath32 moduli .",
    "for concreteness and simplicity we will focus on a polonyi - type superpotential @xcite so that the full superpotential is given by @xmath205 where we have chosen @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 are constants and @xmath209 represents a hidden sector matter field , assumed to be a gauge singlet .",
    "the corresponding khler potential is @xmath210 as shown in @xcite , systems of this type are capable of changing the shape of the run - away scalar potential and lead to formation of stationary points . the stationary point in the configuration eq.([eqn",
    ": fullsuper],[eqn : newkahler ] ) turns out to be a local minimum . by appropriately choosing the parameters of the polonyi subsector",
    "the cosmological constant can be adjusted / finetuned to the desired value .",
    "the consequence of the @xmath158-term uplifting / downlifting is the appearance of a so - called _ little hierarchy _ @xcite originating from the factor @xmath211 in particular it leads to a suppression of the dilaton contribution to the soft terms @xmath212 such that susy breaking is dictated by the matter sector , since @xmath213 .",
    "the scale of the soft terms is set by the gravitino mass @xmath214 implying that @xmath208 sets the scale of the gravitino mass ( and also the mass of the polonyi field ) .",
    "however @xmath215 , consequently the gravitino mass originates from the gaugino condensation and is doubly suppressed . a concrete realization based on the hidden sector gauge group @xmath216",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : benchmark ] and tab.[tab : sample ] , summarizing the main parameters .",
    "v1.5cmv1.5cmv0.8cmv1.5cmv1.5cmv1.1cmv1.5cmv1.1 cm @xmath207 & @xmath208 & @xmath217 & @xmath218 & @xmath219 & @xmath220 & @xmath221 & @xmath222 + ( lr)1 - 8 @xmath223 & @xmath224 & @xmath225 & @xmath226 & @xmath224 & @xmath227{tev}$ ] & @xmath228{tev}$ ] & @xmath229{tev}$ ] +    to analyze the structure of the resulting soft terms we focus on the case @xmath230 . allowing couplings between hidden matter @xmath209 and observable fields",
    "@xmath164 in the khler potential @xmath231 , \\label{eqn : fullkahler}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the emerging soft terms are given by @xmath232 where `` ` anomaly ` '' denotes possible 1-loop and 2-loop contributions to the soft terms .",
    "as eq.([eqn : fs ] ) shows , the dilaton contribution is suppressed by the little hierarchy .",
    "therefore gaugino masses and @xmath17-terms feel the contribution from dilaton and anomaly in comparable portions in the spirit of a hybrid mediation , also know as _ mirage mediation _ @xcite .",
    "the fate of the soft scalar masses is more model dependent and crucially depends on the parameter @xmath233 which describes the coupling between hidden and observable matter . for @xmath234",
    "the dilaton as well as the anomaly contribution are negligible . in this scenario",
    "the scalar masses are dominated by the @xmath158-term of the downlifting field @xmath209 . on the other hand , for @xmath235 the matter contribution to scalar masses",
    "becomes suppressed whereas dilaton and anomaly mediated parts provide comparable contributions .    while one can realize different scenarii for the scalar masses , mirage mediation for the gauginos and the @xmath17-terms is more reliable and independent of @xmath233 .",
    "the gaugino masses encode the mirage unification feature in the most robust way @xcite .",
    "this mirage scale is determined by the relative strength of dilaton versus anomaly mediation in eq.([eqn : softgauginos ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig : gauginos ] shows the evolution of the gaugino masses for equal dilaton / anomaly contribution . finally , the masses of the dilaton , the polonyi field , the gravitino and the gauginos exhibit the hierarchy @xmath236",
    "let us try to see how the new scenario with a doubly suppressed gravitino mass can be applied to various aspects of model building in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the standard formula @xcite for the gravitino mass from a gaugino condensate reads @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "it requires @xmath1 to be at an intermediate scale if @xmath220 is at the ( multi ) tev scale . to raise @xmath1 in a realistic set - up",
    "would require soft terms that are small compared to @xmath220 @xcite and this is not easy to achieve .",
    "the doubly suppressed solution gives @xmath240 and avoids an intermediate scale .    in a rather natural way",
    "@xmath1 could be identified with the grand unified scale @xmath5 or the compactification scale @xmath6 of extra dimensions in string theory , typically assumed to be at a scale of few times @xmath241{gev}$ ] .",
    "thus a single scale @xmath1 might represent @xmath242 as well as the hierarchically small scale @xmath220 .",
    "model building along these limes might be promising .",
    "in our benchmark model we obtained a hidden sector group @xmath216 assuming a pure supersymmetric @xmath243 gauge theory as well as the equality of the gauge coupling constants of hidden and observable sector .",
    "this group could originate certainly from the @xmath244 theory but not so easily @xcite from the @xmath245 theory favored by phenomenological arguments @xcite .",
    "string threshold corrections , however , might enlarge the hidden sector gauge coupling compared to the observable sector one , allowing for smaller hidden sector gauge groups and thus reopening many new ways for model building .",
    "in fact , in heterotic m - theory @xcite , a larger coupling in the hidden sector might appear in a natural way @xcite .",
    "such models might then explain all scales directly from the string scale , without invoking the existence of an intermediate scale .",
    "if we considered a situation with condensation at the intermediate scale in a model with double suppression we would obtain a rather smallish gravitino mass .",
    "susy breaking at the weak scale would then need another source , as in models of supersymmetry breakdown via gauge mediation @xcite ( i.e. the gravitino mass is small compared to the soft susy breaking terms ) .",
    "here one of the challenges is the generation of the @xmath7-term @xmath247 for the higgsino masses at a scale comparable to the soft terms . in such a model we could now consider a condensate at an intermediate scale and a term in the superpotential @xcite @xmath248 where @xmath249 denotes hidden quark superfields .",
    "a condensation at the intermediate scale would then lead to an effective @xmath7-term in the tev - region . in a model with a doubly suppressed gravitino mass , @xmath220",
    "would then be at a scale of the order of @xmath250{ev}$ ] .",
    "axions are promising candidates for quintessence fields as they only have derivative couplings and thus avoid some of the problematic aspects of light ( real ) scalar fields .",
    "they frequently appear in string theory and often have decay constants of order of the planck scale .",
    "a specific scheme for a ( composite ) quintaxion has been outlined in @xcite . as the vacuum energy is small @xmath251{ev})^4 $ ] the axion potential has to be extremely flat and the quintaxion mass exceedingly small .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite such a situation can be realized in the presence of a strongly interacting hidden sector with ( almost ) massless hidden quarks . with massless",
    "quarks the @xmath252-angle is unphysical and the axion potential is flat .",
    "parametrically the vacuum energy is given by @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the mass of ( n quarks ) and @xmath255 is the gluino mass of an @xmath243 gauge group . in the presence of massless quarks and or unbroken supersymmetry @xmath256 .",
    "the key motivation for the model in @xcite was the fact that hidden sector quarks played a crucial role in the generation of @xmath7-term in the superpotential ( @xmath247 ) of the supersymmetric standard model , through higher order couplings in the superpotential , like the one discussed previously @xmath257 once the higgs fields receive nontrivial vacuum expectation values , these same terms induce a hierarchically tiny mass for the hidden sector quarks in a kind of gravitational see - saw mechanism involving the weak scale and the planck scale .",
    "this then made it possible to obtain an axion potential sufficiently flat to be compatible with a realistic value of @xmath258 , although many details of model building have to be clarified @xcite .",
    "one might also include a second invisible axion that solves the @xmath252-problem of qcd .",
    "the model in @xcite considered an intermediate scale @xmath259{gev}$ ] ( responsible for @xmath260 ) .",
    "models with a doubly suppressed gravitino mass and a scale @xmath261 provide a novel way to reconsider quintessential axions , although in a somewhat modified set - up . here",
    "we need a contribution to the @xmath7 term that is more strongly suppressed than the one considered above .",
    "still the fact remains true , that such a term ( relevant for @xmath7 ) would also induce a tiny hidden quark mass term and thus a tiny contribution to the vacuum energy once the higgs fields receive a nonvanishing vev .",
    "a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed in future work .",
    "needless to say , that these consideration are far from a solution to the cosmological constant problem , as other contributions to the vacuum energy ( as e.g. from susy breakdown or from electroweak symmetry breakdown ) have to vanish .",
    "axions might also find important implications in the study of models for the inflationary universe @xcite .",
    "the requirement there is that the effective axion decay constant should be rather large .",
    "again the models considered here with a composite axion in a doubly suppressed solution might open new aspects for model building .",
