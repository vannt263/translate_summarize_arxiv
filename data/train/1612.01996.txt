    "taking into account errors on the local power law slope and normalization , and width and normalization of the gaussian model ( the line center was well measured at 6.38 kev and thus was frozen ) , we calculated @xmath36 @xmath30 as a function of fe k@xmath4 ew in figure [ loc_ew ] ; the horizontal line denotes the 90% confidence level ( @xmath37= 7.779 for four free parameters ) . from this exercise , we find the ( rest - frame ) fe k@xmath4 ew = 2.5@xmath5 kev .",
    "this large ew is quite telling .",
    "to obtain such large values , the transmitted emission must be attenuated more than the fluorescent line emission produced within the medium , which is possible when the column density reaches compton - thick levels of obscuration .",
    "the same effect could be induced by variability , where the agn continuum weakens and the travel time to the fe k@xmath4 emitting region causes a delay in the response to the ew . as we discuss further in section [ xray_var ] , archival x - ray observations of this source indicate the flux and ew have remained constant over time ( 20 and 15 years , respectively ) , such that this scenario seems unlikely .",
    "the measured ew thus implies a higher @xmath10 than what is measured , indicating that another continuum component must dominate at energies below the fe k@xmath4 line .",
    "additionally , as discussed in @xcite , the fe k@xmath4 ew is sensitive to the inclination angle of the obscuring medium when the line - of - sight intersects the torus , with the most extreme ew values ( i.e. , @xmath92 kev ) obtained when the torus is completely edge - on at 90@xmath23 for the geometry assumed in the mytorus model , i.e. , a torus with a fixed 60@xmath23 opening angle .",

    "motivated by our phenomenological modeling of the spectrum and resulting fe k@xmath4 ew measurement , we freeze the inclination angle to 90@xmath23 .",
    "the data require an additional powerlaw component to properly model the soft emission ( i.e. , @xmath36c - stat=703 for a change of 1 in degrees of freedom ( dof ) between the model lacking this component and the one where it is included ) .",
    "we attribute this component to be due to a portion of the intrinsic agn continuum that is scattered into or directly enters our line of sight after leaking through the torus : the powerlaw normalization and @xmath33 are tied to the mytorus components , with a constant factor left free to account for the scattered / leaked fraction of agn light . in figure [ fig_spec_global ] (",

    "however , the fe k@xmath4 complex is worse fit when compared with the phenomenological model , with larger fit residuals around the emission feature ( figure [ fe_ka ] ) .",
    "we note that in this modeling , we used mytorus tables which have a power law termination energy of 200 kev . however when we fit the spectra with termination energies of 100 and 400 kev , which span the range of the highest and lowest values available with mytorus , we obtain essentially identical results .",
