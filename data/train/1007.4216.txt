    "we have found the critical dynamics are consistent with those of other two dimensional triangular magnets with a 120@xmath18 magnetic structure .",
    "however , the critical wave vector and chirality are independent of temperature and a chiral nature of the diffuse scattering remains at temperatures well above t@xmath5 . through an analysis of the structure using a spin dimer calculation , we have followed a scheme where the exchange constants along the @xmath6-axis are helical with two different next nearest neighbor couplings . using this and",
    "the fact that an xy picture seems appropriate we derived the spin - waves for modes propagating along the @xmath6-axis with the spins confined to the @xmath22 plane and have derived the exchange constants .",
    "the experimental values are reasonable agreement with the spin dimer calculation and reproduce the correct magnetic ordering wave vector and curie - weiss constants within error .",
    "these results indicate that the structural and magnetic chiralities are strongly coupled in ba@xmath0nbfe@xmath0si@xmath1o@xmath2 and that symmetric heisenberg exchange is required for this .",
    "these results point to a unique magnetic system where the chirality is imposed by the nuclear structure and not the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "we are grateful to a. orszulik ( isis ) and h. schneider ( jcns ) for expert technical support throughout the experiments and to r. coldea and r. cowley for helpful discussions .",
