    "we may then use the formalism of section [ sec : fluc ] with @xmath35 where we have defined @xmath36 then @xcite we have the result @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39    the condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : step - approx ] ) now becomes @xmath40 where we have assumed that @xmath41 varies slowly with time .",

    "the advantage of a constant correlation length is that the parameter @xmath24 is constant in @xmath45 , so that we can more meaningfully compare the effects of fluctuations with different msw parameters than if we let @xmath9 vary to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : step - approx ] ) . in any case , since @xmath9 and @xmath46 enter only through @xmath24 , one can get identical results to ours by making @xmath9 smaller and increasing @xmath47 .",
    "we solved the system ( [ eq : meanev ] ) numerically ; results are presented in figures 13 for @xmath48 equal to 0.01 , 0.1 , and 0.7 , respectively , and a several values of @xmath47 .",
    "0.01 and 0.7 correspond roughly to the small- and large - mixing solutions @xcite to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "we used the standard solar model of bahcall and pinsonneault , including helium diffusion @xcite , but assumed all neutrinos were produced at the center of the sun .",
    "usually , fluctuations suppress the @xmath49 transition . for the large - angle solution ( @xmath50 ) , the effect on the mean survival probability is noticeable only in the adiabatic region , even in the physically unreasonable case @xmath51 . for smaller angles",
    ", there is some effect in the non - adiabatic region , but the greatest effect is still in the adiabatic region .    in the adiabatic region , for survival probabilities greater than @xmath52 , fluctuations tend to enhance the transition . this has been explained @xcite by appealing to the flatness of the bahcall - pinsonnealt density profile near the center .",
    "neutrinos in this region do not go through the resonance point , but do go through part of the resonance region .",
    "travel through that region has a significant effect since the density profile is flat just after production at the center .",
    "fluctuations can therefore have an effect . to confirm that the enhancement depends on the flatness of the density profile",
    ", we have also solved the system of equations ( [ eq : meanev ] ) for an exponential density profile with central density @xmath53 @xmath54 , and scale height @xmath55 cm .",
    "these values were chosen to give the same density as the bahcall - pinsonneault model at the center and edge of the sun . at @xmath56 , we cut the density to zero for both profiles .",
    "the exponential results are compared to the bahcall - pinsonneault results in figures 46 . for fluctuations above about 2%",
    ", the exponential profile gives noticeably weaker enhancement of the transition probability than the bahcall - pinsonneault profile , and changes the shape of the curve elsewhere as well .",
    "this result indicates that large fluctuations can induce appreciable non - adiabatic effects in the adiabatic region , since the initial density is the same in both cases , and both have the same numerical value of final density before the truncation to zero .",
    "( in any case , the step should have no effect , since the density at the edge of the sun is much less than the resonant density . )",
    "the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite may be used to calculate higher moments of the distribution of survival probabilities .",
    "we will present results for the variance of the distribution , @xmath57 in principle , the formalism could be used to calculate arbitrary higher moments of the distribution of @xmath25 .    from the evolution equation ( [ eq : msw ] ) , it is straightforward to show that @xmath58 as before , we define the density matrix @xmath15 , which now contains the square of the neutrino survival probability , and use the formalism of section [ sec : fluc ] with @xmath59    then in terms of the quantities @xmath60 we have @xmath61 where the subscripts @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the real and imaginary part of the quantity .",
    "we again solved the system numerically , assuming fluctuations of the same form as in section [ sec : mean ] .",
    "the results are presented in figures 79 , for the same mixing parameters and values of @xmath64 as in figure 13 .",
    "the quantity plotted is @xmath65 , rather than the variance itself . for the smaller angles",
    ", there is a dramatic peak in @xmath66 around @xmath67 ev@xmath68/mev , corresponding to neutrinos being produced in the resonance region ( since we assume that all neutrinos are produced at the center of the sun ) .",
    "the results for @xmath69 show a similar increase around @xmath70 ev@xmath68/mev , which again corresponds to production inside the resonance region .",
    "it does not go back down , since the resonance region will include the core for any @xmath45 larger than that .    as the rms noise amplitude increases",
    ", the variance seems to saturate at a value of @xmath71 , independent of the mixing parameters .",
    "two points are relevant to this phenomenon .",
    "first , a uniform probability distribution bounded between zero and one has the same mean and variance .",
    "second , fluctuations will tend to suppress the oscillation of @xmath72 as a function of time , since it becomes a superposition of oscillations with differing phases .",
    "therefore , we may set the time derivatives on the left - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : meanev ] ) and ( [ eq : varev ] ) to zero . assuming that @xmath24 goes to zero smoothly , we are led to the trivial solution @xmath73 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanev ] ) , and @xmath74 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : varev ] ) , where we have taken the limit @xmath75 .",
    "this yields a variance of @xmath71 and a mean of @xmath52 , as expected .    in order to illustrate the magnitude of the effect , in figures 10 - 12",
    ", we plot the mean survival probability plus and minus the width @xmath66 of the distribution .",
    "note that , even though we did not calculate the higher moments , the mean survival probability plus and minus @xmath66 is bounded between zero and one , suggesting that the distribution of @xmath25 is not very skewed .",
    "the variance is a potentially important tool for the exploration of solar density fluctuations on some time scales .",
    "fluctuations on the time scale of a radiochemical experiment s run would broaden the distribution of count rates , since different runs would have different survival probabilities .",
    "none of the experiments currently operating has noted a broader distribution of rates than expected @xcite , suggesting that the neutrino data will probably limit , rather than measure , such fluctuations . for the favored , small - angle solution ,",
    "the variance is strongly peaked when neutrinos are produced near the resonance .",
    "this suggests that the finite radial distribution of neutrino production will have an important effect , likely extending the peak to lower values of @xmath45 , since those correspond to resonance farther out in the sun .",
    "further , it means that density fluctuations will affect pp neutrinos more strongly than other neutrinos , so that gallium experiments may put the strongest limit on fluctuations .    to develop a very rough estimate of the limit on fluctuations",
    ", we note that their effect should become noticeable when the ratio @xmath76 becomes comparable to the relative @xmath77 experimental uncertainty . to simplify the argument",
    ", we assume that the signal observed at the gallium experiment consists only of @xmath78 mev pp neutrinos .",
    "( standard msw analyses indicate the near - complete suppression of other neutrinos . ) as an example , we will consider the gallex results .",
    "gallex has a @xmath77 uncertainty of approximately 13% and an energy - averaged survival probability of about 60% @xcite .",
    "a 1% density fluctuation on the time scale of a gallex run , 20 to 28 days , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ev@xmath68/mev ( chosen to give a 60% survival probability ) , has @xmath81 .",
    "it is likely , then , that a careful study could rule out fluctuations on that level .    in the future , real - time",
    ", high - statistics detectors such as hellaz @xcite and borexino @xcite could be used to investigate fluctuations on shorter time scales . in particular ,",
    "a helioseismological g - mode oscillation could leave a signature in the neutrino data . unfortunately",
    ", the current high - statistics experiments sno @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite probably can not be used to probe fluctuations in this way , as they are not sensitive to low - energy neutrinos .",
    "a proper averaging over neutrino production location would be extremely cpu - intensive . in this",
    "regard , approximate analytic techniques to compute the moments of the density matrix , such as that of ref .",
