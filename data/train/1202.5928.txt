    "can not be presented as a real heegaard decomposition of genus 1 while we know that there _ is _ a real heegaard decomposition @xcite .",

    "[ maksimal ] ( through an observation in @xcite ) there are infinitely many real closed oriented 3-manifolds which can not have a maximal real heegaard decomposition .",
    "several more observations are in order :    * all open book decompositions with annuli pages can be made real ( since the monodromy can only be a power of the dehn twist along the belt circle and any power of the dehn twist can be written as a product of two real structures ) .",
    "thus , all lens spaces admitting an open book with annuli pages can be made real and hence admit a real heegaard splitting of genus 1 .",

    "hence , this type of lens spaces have a real genus-2 heegaard splitting . * for an example to above consider @xmath175 on which there are 3 real structures ; they are of types  @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "hence there is no genus-1 real heegaard decomposition of @xmath175 .",
    "meanwhile , on a sphere with three punctures there are only two real structures .",
    "thus , with respect to at least one real structure the corresponding heegaard decomposition must have genus greater than @xmath176 .    following this discussion ,",
    "we ask a natural question :    * question . *",
    "given a real closed 3-manifold @xmath10 , what is the _",
    "@xmath9-real heegaard genus _",
    ", i.e. what is the minimum genus among all real heegaard decompositions representing @xmath9 ?    to finish this section , let us display the question we raised in the introduction .",
    "* question .",
    "* does every real 3-manifold @xmath10 admit a @xmath9-real open book ?",

    "a _ real contact cell decomposition _ over @xmath6 is a cell decomposition of @xmath6 with each @xmath255-skeleton @xmath9-invariant ( @xmath256 ) ; each 2-cell is convex with tw@xmath257 ; and @xmath258 is tight when restricted to each 3-cell .      _",
    "proof : _ we cover @xmath6 with a @xmath9-invariant , finite set of darboux balls .",
    "we then choose a real cell decomposition such that each 3-cell lies in the interior of a darboux ball .",
    "note that every real manifold has an equivariant cell decomposition @xcite .",
    "we now turn this equivariant cell decomposition into a contact one .",
    "first , we make the 1-skeleton legendrian .",
    "note that the real structure acts on a 1-cell as the identity or a reflection , or it swaps two 1-cells . by definition ,",
    "the real part is legendrian .",
    "if the real structure exchanges two 1-cells , those cells are disjoint .",
    "if their closure are not disjoint , by possiblly subdividing the cell decompostion equivariantly , we can make sure that they have a single common end point which is real .",
    "as the condition of being legendrian is satisfied at a real point , we can make such a 1-cell pair legendrian symmetrically .",
    "if the real structure acts on a 1-cell @xmath259 as reflection then the two halves of @xmath259 can be perturbed legendrian symmetrically relative their common real end point , at which the legendrian condition is satisfied .",
    "as each 2-cell remains inside the darboux balls , ( weak ) bennequin inequality applies , so tw@xmath260 for each 2-cell @xmath261 .",
    "hence we can perturb each @xmath261 to make it convex ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  3.1 ) .",
    "the real structure can act on a 2-cell as a reflection or a rotation , or it switches two 2-cells . in the latter case ,",
    "@xmath261 and @xmath262 are disjoint ; closure of them may have a common boundary piece which is real",
    ". therefore each such 2-cell @xmath261 can be perturbed relative its boundary to make it convex and @xmath262 can be perturbed symmetrically .",
    "if the real structure acts on @xmath261 as reflection , then as before the two halves can be perturbed symmetrically relative their boundary to make them convex .",
    "if @xmath9 acts on a 2-cell @xmath261 as rotation , then the characteristic field on @xmath261 is an anti - symmetric vector field tangent to the boundary .",
    "the work in @xcite shows that among all such vector fields , the structural stable ones are dense .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath261 can be perturbed convex , employing similar final steps in the proof of proposition  3.3 in @xcite .",
    "once every 2-cell is made convex , we subdivide those 2-cells with tw@xmath263 to get 2-cells with correct twisting .",
    "the subdivision can be made symmetrically .",
    "this is true even if the 2-cell is @xmath8-invariant since the dividing set can be chosen invariant ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1 ) . by the legendrian realization principle",
    "@xcite each arc added to 2-cells during the subdivision can be made legendrian keeping the 2-cells convex .",
    "therefore , we obtain a @xmath9-equivariant contact cell decomposition on @xmath6 . @xmath56 + given @xmath254 take a real contact cell decomposition .",
    "the _ real ribbon _ of the 1-skeleton @xmath264 is a compact surface @xmath265 with boundary such that ( i ) @xmath9 acts on @xmath265 reversing the orientation , ( ii ) @xmath265 retracts onto @xmath264 and ( iii ) @xmath265 is tangent to @xmath266 if and only if @xmath267 .",
    "it is easy to see that any invariant legendrian graph has a real ribbon .",
    "_ proof : _ note that the second claim is independent from the real structure and a proof has been given in @xcite .",
    "moreover , since it is known that the ribbon is a page of an open book supporting @xmath258 ( see @xcite or @xcite ) , we only need to show that the open book having real ribbon as a page can be constructed equivariantly .    to this end ,",
    "let us first choose an invariant neighborhood @xmath269 of the real ribbon @xmath265 such that @xmath270 and that the boundary @xmath271 is a convex surface with dividing curve @xmath272 .",
    "we can identify @xmath269 with @xmath273 $ ] quotient by @xmath274 , for @xmath275 and @xmath276 $ ] on which real structure acts as @xmath277 .",
    "then the projection @xmath278/_{\\sim}\\to [ -1 , 1]$ ] defines one  half \" of the open book . by the construction of the contact cell decomposition",
    "each 2-cell @xmath89 of the cell decomposition is convex and has boundary with twisting @xmath279 relative @xmath89 . since @xmath265 twists with the contact structure along the",
    "1-skeleton , each 2-cell @xmath89 intersects @xmath272 at exactly two points .",
    "thus , we can extend the fibration in @xmath269 , in an obvious way , in a neighborhood of each 2-cell . in figure  [ 2hucre ] ( left ) , we depict a 2-cell foliated by the pages of the open book .",
    "each page traces an arc and all arcs meet at points touching @xmath272 .    as for",
    "the extension of the real structure , let us first assume that the 2-cell @xmath89 is invariant , so the boundary of the 2-cell admits an involution which is a reflection or a rotation . in the case of reflection ,",
    "the involution fixes the points touching @xmath272 .",
    "since any two involutions on a circle fixing the same pair of points can be extended to an involution of a disk in such way that the extension is unique up to isotopy relative to boundary , we can extend the real structure on a neighborhood of the 2-cell in such a way that it commutes with the fibration ( figure  [ 2hucre ] , middle ) . in the case of rotation the points touching @xmath272 interchanged by the real structure , so similar idea applies ( figure  [ 2hucre ] , right ) .",
    "the case when the real structure swaps two 2-cells can also be similarly treated .",
    "now , if we trace the dividing curve on the boundary of each ( 3-cell@xmath280int@xmath281 ) , we obtain a connected closed curve @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can extend the open book over 3-cells in such a way that the dividing curve becomes a part of the binding and the pages foliate the 3-cells as shown in figure  [ 3top ] .",
    "in fact , an involution on @xmath282 with the prescribed image of a fixed closed curve can be extended to a unique ( up to isotopy relative boundary ) involution of @xmath283 preserving the fibration described above .            _",
    "proof : _ the proof follows the idea of the non - real case proposed by e.  giroux @xcite .",
    "it is enough to show that any real open book supporting @xmath258 comes from a real contact cell decomposition after possibly a number of positive real stabilizations .",
    "then the rest of the proof will follow similar lines of the original proof .",
    "let @xmath13 be a real open book of @xmath14 supporting @xmath258 .",
    "we consider the heegaard decomposition @xmath284 defined by @xmath54 with the heegaard surface @xmath285 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the diffeomorphism @xmath286 where @xmath287 is the inherited real structure on the page @xmath288 , @xmath289 . recall that @xmath290 where @xmath26 is the monodromy of the open book .",
    "note that @xmath66 is convex ; in fact , consider a self - indexing real morse function @xmath291 $ ] with @xmath292 and @xmath293)$ ] , @xmath294)$ ] .",
    "then its gradient field is by definition contact and transversal to @xmath66 , rendering @xmath66 convex .",
    "moreover @xmath167 is an invariant dividing curve on @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath98 be an abstract surface diffeomorphic to a page .",
    "we consider the abstract handlebody @xmath295/_{(x , t)\\sim(x , t')}$ ] for all @xmath296 and @xmath297 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath298 gets a real structure @xmath299 from @xmath24 ( keeping the same notation for the real structures on @xmath24 and on @xmath161 ) .",
    "we define a cell decomposition on @xmath300 as follows .",
    "consider a @xmath299-invariant set @xmath166 of disjoint proper arcs on @xmath161 dividing it into disks .",
    "each such arc @xmath87 defines a disk @xmath301/_{\\sim } \\subset   w$ ] . by the choice of the set @xmath166 , the set of all @xmath302 s cuts @xmath300 into 3-balls ,",
    "so we have a cell decomposition on @xmath300 whose 1-skeleton is two copies of @xmath166 ( one on @xmath161 , the other , say @xmath303 on @xmath304 ) and whose 2-skeleton consists of the disks @xmath305 and the disks on @xmath306 .",
    "let @xmath164 denote a @xmath299-invariant set of closed curves on @xmath161 forming a core for @xmath161 .",
    "we may impose that @xmath164 contains the closed real curves ( if exist ) lying on @xmath161 .",
    "such a core can always be chosen .",
    "now , we add @xmath164 to the 1-skeleton of the cell decomposition described above to get a cell decomposition on @xmath300 in the sense of l.  siebenmann @xcite .",
    "the cell decomposition on @xmath300 constructed above gives a cell decomposition on @xmath6 ( by means of the identifications of @xmath300 with @xmath307 ) whose 1-skeleton contains @xmath308 on @xmath161 and @xmath309 on @xmath310 .",
    "note first that , the 1-skeleton is @xmath9-invariant .",
    "namely , we have @xmath311 , as @xmath164 and @xmath166 are chosen @xmath299-invariant .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath312 ; thus , @xmath309 is @xmath120-invariant .",
    "it is easy to see that by construction , 2- and 3-skeletons are also @xmath9-invariant .",
    "thus , we get a real cell decomposition on @xmath14 .",
    "we now perturb 1-skeleton equivariantly as before to make it legendrian . for 1-cells on @xmath161",
    "legendrian realization principle applies , so we make them legendrian keeping @xmath161 convex and the 1-cells @xmath119-invariant .",
    "then we perturb the 1-cells on @xmath310 legendrian keeping them equivariant .",
    "note that we are not required to reside on @xmath310 nor to keep @xmath310 convex here .",
    "again as before , each 2-cell has twisting less than @xmath279 , so for each 2-cell @xmath261 we can arrange tw@xmath313 to be @xmath279 by subdividing @xmath261 .",
    "each arc of the subdivision can be made legendrian keeping @xmath261 convex . by construction",
    "each 3-cell is away from a core of a page , thus it lies in a tight manifold .",
    "now , for each arc in the 1-skeleton not lying on @xmath161 , we can perform a stabilization to include it to the page @xmath161 .",
    "such a stabilization exists since by the construction of the cell decomposition , each such arc together with an arc on @xmath161 bounds a disk @xmath89 with tw@xmath314 .",
    "hence , we perform a finite number of positive real stabilizations so that the stabilized @xmath161 becomes a real ribbon of the 1-skeleton .",
    "@xmath56 + it is worth mentioning that in the proof of lemma  [ hucreleme ] , it is possible to start with an equivariant cell decomposition where the real part lies entirely in the 1-skeleton .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to observe that if given an equivariant cell decomposition , one can always get the real part lie entirely in the 1-skeleton .",
    "then by turning such a decomposition into a contact cell decomposition and by defining the real ribbon , we indeed obtain a real open book with real part lying entirely on a page .",
    "however , if we restrict ourselves to such class of equivariant cell decompositions , then the proof for proposition  [ aynikitap ] would not work . more precisely , it is not true that given a real open book there is a series of positive real stabilizations which produces a real open book with the real part lying entirely on a page .",
    "for example , the real hopf open book depicted on the top of figure  [ hopfstablari ] can not be positively equivariantly stabilized so that the real part becomes a subset of a page .",
    "in fact , it is not hard to see that if a page contains more than one piece of the same connected component of the real part , then there is no way to get the real part lie on a page by positive real stabilizations .",
