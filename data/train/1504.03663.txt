    "special relativity ( sr ) formulated at the beginning of the xx century formed a basis for the new understanding of space - time and physical processes taking place in it .",
    "one of the key features of sr is its geometrical interpretation : in the core of relativistic physics there lies the concept of 4-dimensional minkowski space - time @xmath0 with pseudo - euclidean metric @xmath1geometric language of sr makes it possible to explicitly and consistently formulate its essence and main foundations as well as to deduce its various implications and make a consistent transition to general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "theoretical basis for this article is provided by the consequent space - time interpretation of elementary objects in the 4-dimensional minkowski world .",
    "newtonian laws were verified earlier @xcite within the concept of 4-dimensional statics of highly stretched strings . in this paper",
    ", we are going to depart from the traditional interpretation of an elementary particle and follow the logics of minkowski 4-dimensional geometry .",
    "it means that we take as an elementary physical object not a particle s world line , but a true material point of @xmath0 space  metric sphere of zero radius . in space - time",
    "it corresponds to a light - cone with material characteristics concentrated on it .",
    "general considerations suggest that these elementary object - sources correspond to a space - time field .",
    "such field is a 4-dimensional hyperbolic analog of coulomb field . according to this approach",
    ", the extended structures like world lines or world tubes stretched along time - like direction should be obtained by the alignment ( condensation ) of the elementary event points which can be described in frames of a certain generalized theory of condensed media in 4-dimensional space - time .",
    "naturally , there arises a question about the relationship between their collective field and the observable physical fields that are the subjects of standard physics .",
    "this question in its simplest formulation is the main subject of this study .",
    "we will use the hyperbolic analogue of coulomb s law in minkowski space as a starting point for our considerations .",
    "this analogue can be defined as a spherically symmetric ( in the pseudo - euclidean sphere sense ) solution of the wave equation @xmath2 in the empty space - time that surrounds the centre of the hyperbolic sphere . at the same time , we keep in mind that the spherically symmetric solution of laplace equation in vacuum @xmath3is the unique one ( up to a constant ) , while the immediate verification shows that it contains all information about its point source .",
    "indeed , the solution of ( [ laplas1 ] ) in the form of coulomb potential @xmath4 actually , satisfies the equation @xmath5 in all the space .",
    "the last equality takes into consideration the transformation of delta - function when passing to curvilinear coordinates @xcite .    as in case with coulomb field",
    ", we do nt put the question of the source structure in equation ( [ wave1 ] ) : the solution automatically contains the singular characteristics of the source . in order to obtain this solution , let us choose the hyperbolic spherically symmetric 4-dimensional coordinate system with zero in the center : @xmath6here @xmath7 is the 4-radius , @xmath8 is the hyperbolic angle , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the pair of standard spherical angles",
    ". formulae ( hypc ) are valid for the domains where @xmath11 minkowski metric in this coordinate system can be obtained by using standard rules for the transformation of an interval .",
    "it takes the following form : @xmath12 in differential geometry , the wave - operator can be invariantly determined by the formula @xcite : @xmath13where @xmath14 is the metric tensor determinant , @xmath15 is the contravariant components of the metric , whose matrix is inverse to @xmath16 . from ( [ g1 ] )",
    ", it follows that @xmath17 while the inverse matrix takes the form : @xmath18substituting these expressions into the general formula ( [ wave3 ] ) , we obtain the expression for wave operator in the 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system : @xmath19where we ve introduced the following designation for the angle part of wave operator : and expression for @xmath20 transits into laplace operator in 3-dimensional spherical coordinate system with @xmath21 @xmath22substituting the general form of spherically symmetric solution @xmath23 into operator [ wave5 ] ) , we obtain the following equation : @xmath24its general , the solution takes the form : @xmath25where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are integration constants .",
    "let us regard the obtained solution as an analogue of the fundamental solution for the hyperbolic field whose sources are the _ material events , _ i.e. the _ _  _ _ cone with the distributed characteristic @xmath28 which we will call the _",
    "hyperbolic charge_. immediate verification shows that the obtained solution satisfies the 4-dimensional analogue of the solution ) directly in spherically symmetric coordinate system , because this form does nt contain the infinite factor @xmath29 , which is an analogue of the factor @xmath30 in ( [ laplas2 ] ) which in its turn determines the measure of set of all directions in @xmath31 ( [ laplas2 ] ) : @xmath32here we use the term `` analogue of fundamental solution '' , because , unlike the classical fundamental solution used in mathematical physics , the singularity of ( [ sol ] ) is concentrated on the light - cone and not in the point .",
    "we will call the solution ( [ sol ] ) _ hyperbolic fundamental solution _ of wave equation , in order to distinguish it from the well - known fundamental solution ( causal green s function ) of classical field theory : @xmath33here @xmath34 is heaviside step function .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the hyperbolic fundamental solution of the form ( [ sol ] ) satisfies the equation ( [ sol1 ] ) in generalized sense in all causal domains .",
    "in order to reveal the intrinsic relation between the classical field theory and the hyperbolic field , let us , first , consider the following simple situation  a pair of classical particle - sources at rest in a certain inertial reference frame . in a 4-dimensional coordinate system adjusted to this reference frame , the pair of these particles , described in @xmath35 is the pair of world lines , parallel to the time - axis and separated by spatial distance @xmath36 these world lines are weaved  out of material events .",
    "the superposition principle for the hyperbolic field is valid , because of the linearity of the wave equation .",
    "it means that the resulting field , @xmath37 of the world line of particle 1 calculated for a certain point on the world line of particle 2 can be obtained by integration : @xmath38where @xmath39 @xmath40 is the linear density of hyperbolic charge 1 , @xmath41 is the duration of particle history ( regularization parameter ) .",
    "multipliing @xmath42 by element @xmath43 of the hyperbolic charge of the second particle world line , and integrating along the same line , we obtain : @xmath44this is the full energy of hyperbolic interaction between the classical particles ( factor @xmath45 appears because the double integration doubly accounts for the same pair of elements on the world lines ) .    passing to physical notations @xmath46 in ( [ sum ] ) ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath47@xmath48if we pass to exact limits @xmath49 @xmath50 in this expression , it will diverge independently on the order in which the limiting processes are done .",
    "let us consider a world in which the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath51 differ from their ideal limit values .",
    "these parameters have different physical meanings : the value of @xmath41 reflects `` the duration of history ''  of the particle - sources , while the value of @xmath51 represents causality . if @xmath52 the interaction due to the hyperbolic field propagates strictly at the speed of light along the cones .",
    "small deviations of @xmath51 from zero correspond to the picture in which the cones are slightly blurred .",
    "thus , parameter @xmath51 acquires the meaning of an additional `` fundamental variable ''  which could be formally described as @xmath53where @xmath54 is the absolute undeterminacy of the speed of light @xmath55 ( `` fundamental constant '' ) . in order to describe such a world which has more general properties than minkowski space - time has in sr ,",
    "it would be natural to start by considering not the limit of expression([sum1 ] ) , when @xmath49 @xmath56 but rather its asymptotic form under these conditions .",
    "restricting ourselves by a couple of first terms of the corresponding expansions ( and cutting inessential additive constants ) , we obtain : @xmath57the expression ( [ sum2 ] ) can be divided into logarithmic part and coulomb part .",
    "the latter is retained due to the finite value of the product @xmath58 which is responsible for a specific balance between the history duration and causality .",
    "taking into account ( [ sol4 ] ) , the asymptotic approximation of the final expression for the interaction energy of the pair of particle - sources at rest is as follows : @xmath59where @xmath60 are the coulomb charges , @xmath61 are the logarithmic charges that coincide with linear density of the original hyperbolic charge .",
    "the graph of function ( [ result ] ) is shown on fig.[fig1 ] .        the coulomb part of the potential ( [ result ] )",
    "dominates for small distances , the logarithmic one dominates for large distances .",
    "according to the asymptotic theory described here , the `` small distances '' are defined by the natural condition @xmath64 to make a rough concordance with observations , let us set @xmath65 ( present accuracy of light speed measurement ) , @xmath66s ( today s notion for the time scale of universe existence ) .",
    "then the coulomb domain can be determined by the inequality : @xmath67 m , which excedingly covers the solar system scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the logarithmic part inevitably dominates on cosmological scales .",
    "as can be easily demonstrated , the logarithmic potential naturally ensures the flat character of rotation curves , related to common massive center , making it unnecessary to refer to the dark matter concept .",
    "indeed , newton s second law for the attractive force in rotary motion is @xmath68 and we obtain : @xmath69    we would like to stress that our approach eliminates the need for the dark matter concept in principle , as it is also the case with theories like mond ( modified newton dynamics ) @xcite or agd ( anisotropic geometrodynamics ) @xcite .",
    "contrary to mond , we do not modify the form of newton second law , and unlike agd , we do not rely mainly on geometry .",
    "our approach deals with the principally new definition of an elementary physical object and with the modified fundamental law of interaction between such objects ."
