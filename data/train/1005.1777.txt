    "due to their weakly coupled layered structure , most of the high - t@xmath3 cuprate superconductors ( htsc ) are highly anisotropic , a feature which affects many of the most important properties of these materials , including their response to magnetic and electric fields.@xcite the central parameter when describing this anisotropic behaviour is the so - called anisotropy factor , @xmath4 , which may be defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the effective supercarrier masses for currents flowing in the @xmath8 ( cuo@xmath0 ) layers and , respectively , along the @xmath9 axis.@xcite particularly useful in describing the phenomenology of the htsc are the relationships between @xmath4 and the two dimensionless scales defined by the ratio between the superconducting layers periodicity length , @xmath10 , and the two superconducting characteristic lengths , the coherence length in the @xmath8 planes , @xmath11 , and the penetration length for a magnetic field applied perpendicularly to these planes , @xmath12.@xcite on the one side , @xmath13 represents the anisotropy above which the material behaves as a stack of josephson - coupled superconducting layers , and a lawrence - doniach ( ld ) description may be required.@xcite on the other , @xmath14 is the threshold for two - dimensional ( 2d ) effects to appear in the vortex structure : for instance , a _ kinked _ vortex lattice , @xcite a decoupled set of vortex lattices parallel and perpendicular to the _ ab _",
    "layers,@xcite or the vortex _ lock - in _ onto the _ ab _",
    "layers direction,@xcite may appear in tilted crystals when @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the angle between the applied magnetic field and the crystal s @xmath9 axis .",
    "the interest of a precise knowledge of the anisotropy factors of the htsc is also enhanced by the present debate on the nature of the meissner transition in these cuprate superconductors , mainly in the subdoped regime , and on the applicability of the different ginzburg - landau like approaches to describe at a phenomenological level their behavior.@xcite    in spite of its relevance , the anisotropy factors of some of the most important htsc families , mainly in the case of the most anisotropic ones based in bi , tl , or hg , are still not well settled , the dispersion in the different proposed values being very large . for instance , in the case of tl-2223 @xmath4 values as low as 2.8 and up to 900 were proposed.@xcite one reason for such a dispersion lies in the samples structural and stoichiometric quality : for instance , a @xmath17 mosaic spread would strongly affect the determination of the anisotropy factor if it is larger than @xmath18 .",
    "also , @xmath4 may be strongly dependent on the doping level , and doping - level variations from sample to sample may lead to large differences in the observed @xmath4 value .",
    "another reason lies in the procedures currently used to determine @xmath4 .",
    "for instance measurements of the ratio between the _ longitudinal _ and _ transverse _ magnetizations or resistivities require aligning the crystal with magnetic or electric fields with accuracies of the order of @xmath19 , i.e. , close to @xmath20 when @xmath21 .",
    "these difficulties associated with the crystal alignment may be overcome by measuring the @xmath16 dependence of the magnetic torque per unit volume , @xmath22 , in the reversible mixed state : the 3d anisotropic ginzburg - landau approach ( 3d - agl ) predicts a strong dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath4 mainly close to @xmath24.@xcite therefore , a fine angular sampling around this @xmath16 value will in principle suffice for a precise @xmath4 determination .",
    "however , @xmath25 presents a contribution from the components of the magnetization in the directions parallel , @xmath26 , and perpendicular , @xmath27 , to the _ ab_-layers , @xmath28 , and this last component may be strongly affected , mainly in highly anisotropic superconductors , by thermal fluctuations of the 2d vortices ( pancakes).@xcite this could limit the applicability of the 3d - agl approach to extract @xmath4 from these measurements.@xcite    in this paper , we present measurements of the angular dependence of the magnetization vector , @xmath29 , in the reversible mixed state in a high quality single crystal of the strongly anisotropic tl@xmath0ba@xmath0ca@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( tl-2223 ) . for that",
    ", we measured simultaneously the longitudinal , @xmath30 and the transverse , @xmath31 , magnetization components relative to the applied magnetic field .",
    "this procedure allows to overcome the difficulties stressed above : these data provides a stringent check of the applicability of the 3d - agl theory , which predicts that the ratio @xmath32 depends only on @xmath4 and @xmath16.@xcite in addition , one may obtain the perpendicular and parallel components of @xmath29 ( @xmath27 and @xmath26 ) and then to check the relevance of the superconducting fluctuation effects on @xmath27 .",
    "let us note already here that until now only very few works include simultaneous measurements of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the reversible mixed state , and they correspond to samples with a relatively moderate anisotropy.@xcite the analyses of our present data shows that the angular dependence of @xmath27 follows the one predicted by a london approach for layered superconductors which includes the contribution of the pancakes fluctuations .",
    "the breakdown of this approach observed when @xmath16 is only 0.3@xmath33 away from @xmath34 is attributed to the mosaic spread present in the sample , and allowed to estimate a lower bound for the anisotropy factor of tl-2223 as high as @xmath35190 .",
    "the tl-2223 sample used in this work is a plate - like single crystal ( 1.1@xmath360.75@xmath360.226 mm@xmath37 ) with the @xmath9 crystallographic axis perpendicular to the largest face .",
    "details of its growth procedure and characterization by maignan _",
    "_ may be found in ref .  .",
    "it is the same crystal used in the magnetization measurements with @xmath38 presented in ref .  , which presents a sharp low - field diamagnetic transition ( @xmath39 k ) and a large meissner fraction ( @xmath3580% ) .",
    "of a great importance for the present work is the excellent alignment of the crystal @xmath9-axis : the rocking curves of ( 00@xmath40 ) reflections ( inset in fig .",
    "1 ) may be fitted to a lorentz distribution of only @xmath41 wide ( fwhm ) , which will allow to study the angular dependence of the magnetization vector in almost the entire angular range .",
    "the magnetization measurements were performed with a commercial squid magnetometer ( quantum design , model mpms ) , equipped with detectors for the components of the magnetic moment along ( @xmath42 ) and transverse ( @xmath43 ) to the applied magnetic field .",
    "the sample was glued with a minute of ge varnish to a rotating sample holder ( also from quantum design ) which allowed rotations about the @xmath44 and @xmath45 axes . in both cases ,",
    "the orientation may be specified within 0.1@xmath33 , with a reproducibility of @xmath46 about the @xmath44 axis and @xmath47 about the @xmath45 axis .    )",
    "frame and to the perpendicular - parallel ( @xmath48 ) frame ( the crystal @xmath9 axis is along the @xmath49 axis ) .",
    "lower inset : rocking curves of the ( 00 ) and ( 00 ) reflections .",
    "they reveal the presence of a @xmath9-axis mosaic spread following a lorentz distribution of only @xmath350.08@xmath33 wide ( fwhm ) . ]",
    "the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath43 was measured at constant temperatures below @xmath50 ( 100 k and 110 k ) under a 1  t magnetic field .",
    "these values were chosen because they are well inside the reversible region of the @xmath51 phase diagram even for @xmath52 , and in the low magnetic field regime [ @xmath53 even for @xmath54 , both facts allowing an easy comparison with the theory ( see below ) .",
    "the resulting longitudinal and transverse magnetizations ( @xmath55 , where @xmath56  mg is the crystal mass and @xmath57  g / cm@xmath37 is the _ theoretical _ density ) are presented in fig .  1 , where the choice for the ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) and ( @xmath49,@xmath59 ) frames is also shown .",
    "@xmath30 in that figure is already corrected for a small contribution to the magnetic moment coming mainly from the sample holder .",
    "this contribution ( of about @xmath60  am@xmath61 , and @xmath16-independent within @xmath62% ) was determined at a temperature well above @xmath50 ( 200  k ) where the effect of superconducting fluctuations is negligible , but taking into account that it presents a slight temperature dependence ( about -5@xmath63  am@xmath61 per k ) . the uncertainty in the corrected @xmath30 at 110  k is estimated to be less than @xmath64% .    as expected , for @xmath54 or @xmath52 @xmath31 vanishes",
    "this discards the presence of any spurious contribution to the measured @xmath31 coming from the longitudinal component , @xmath30 . for an arbitrary @xmath16 value",
    "@xmath31 it is not null because of the crystal anisotropy . in view of the large @xmath65 values",
    "( for it is even larger than @xmath66 ) it may be already inferred that the crystal is strongly anisotropic .",
    "close to @xmath52 , @xmath67 and @xmath65 presents a sharp peak which was not observed in the pioneering magnetization vector experiments by tuominen _",

    ", this already suggests that the anisotropy factor in tl-2223 must be much larger than this value .",
    "in the framework of the 3d - agl theory , in the london region [ i.e. , for @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the lower and upper critical fields , respectively ] , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given by@xcite @xmath73\\ ] ] and @xmath74.\\ ] ] here @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 a constant about the unity related to the vortex lattice structure , @xmath79 the magnetic flux quantum , and @xmath80 the magnetic permeability .",
    "it has been early noted @xcite that the ratio @xmath32 is only dependent on @xmath16 and @xmath4 : @xmath81 this fact has been used in previous works to determine the anisotropy factor from simultaneous measurements of @xmath82 and @xmath83.@xcite in fig .",
    "2(a ) we present the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath32 , as results from the data in fig .  1 .",

    "the agreement is very good for @xmath84 , independently of the @xmath4 value used above @xmath85 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , closer to @xmath52 where the theoretical @xmath32 is strongly dependent on @xmath4 , the disagreement is very important : by using @xmath86 , the amplitude of the peak observed close to @xmath52 is underestimated . on the contrary , if a larger value is used , i.e. , @xmath87 , the peak amplitude is reproduced but the fit to the data for @xmath88 is poor . such a disagreement is not significantly improved by using a generalization of the 3d - agl approach to quasi-2d layered superconductors proposed by hao@xcite .",
    "this author suggested that the @xmath16 dependence of the upper critical field may be parametrized by @xmath89^n+\\left[\\frac{h_{c2}(\\theta)\\sin\\theta}{h_{c2}^{\\parallel}}\\right]^2=1 ,   \\label{hc2hao}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 .",
    "if @xmath91 , the above equation reduces to the result of the effective mass model @xmath92 , while if @xmath93 it leads to the result of tinkham for a thin film . in the framework of this model it is found @xmath94 where @xmath95 as results from eq .",

    "ii ) from the theoretical point of view , the effect of thermal fluctuations on the 2d vortices positions was not taken into account on deriving eqs .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) and ( [ ratiohao]).@xcite however , it was later shown that these fluctuations may be very important for temperatures close to @xmath50 when @xmath101.@xcite in particular , they give rise to the so - called _ crossing point _ in which the magnetization at a temperature few kelvin below @xmath50 is independent of the applied magnetic field.@xcite while fluctuations of _ pancake _ vortices are reasonably well established , there is no experimental evidence or theoretical basis for corresponding positional fluctuations of josephson vortices in the case with @xmath102 ; consequently , it is not expected that the ratio @xmath32 should follow eq .",

    "( [ ratiohao ] ) .    an alternative way of analyzing @xmath82 and @xmath83 consist of obtaining the @xmath29 components in the directions perpendicular @xmath27 and parallel @xmath26 to the @xmath8 layers through the linear transformation @xmath103 the result is presented in fig .",
    "as expected , a first advantage of this procedure is that in the vicinity of @xmath52 , @xmath27 is much less affected than @xmath32 by the experimental uncertainties in @xmath30 . in addition , the data for @xmath27 may be directly compared with the bulaevskii , ledvig and kogan ( blk ) expression which takes into account the above mentioned thermal fluctuations of 2d vortices,@xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 , and @xmath106 is a constant of the order of the unity .",

    "( [ blktheta2 ] ) .",

    "this procedure , which was successfully used in the literature to probe the applicability of the 3d - agl approach and to obtain @xmath4 in moderately anisotropic samples , was shown to be inappropriate in the present case : on the one side , there is a large experimental uncertainty associated to the vanishing of @xmath30 when @xmath127 due to the high anisotropy of tl-2223 . on the other , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
