    "it is clear that due to large fluctuations in the longitudinal development of extensive air showers ( eas ) and relatively weak sensitivity of eas characteristics to the mass of the parent particle , the observed parameters of showers initiated by particles with different primary masses largely overlap . in order to estimate the primary mass in the case of the individual shower or to estimate the mean mass composition at a certain energy we have to use as many observables as possible . to process the big amount of information various multiparametric and non - parametric methods",
    "are employed . among them",
    "are multivariate fitting , knn - method , bayesian approach , neural net analysis and others . in @xcite",
    "we proposed a new method of the multiparametric topological analysis ( mta ) for the study of the _ mean _ mass composition on the basis of the eas longitudinal development data .",
    "we tested this method using the data simulated in the eev energy region for the pierre auger experiment and were encouraged by its accuracy and the easy applicability . in this contribution",
    "we test this method at the lower , pev energy region close to the well known knee in the primary cosmic ray energy spectrum ( @xmath03 pev ) .",
    "experimental arrays for the eas study in this energy region are usually more compact and are able to measure the total size of electron @xmath1 , muon @xmath2 , hadron @xmath3 and cherenkov light @xmath4 components of the shower .",
    "the typical example of such a complex eas array is kascade @xcite .",
    "here we use only two parameters : @xmath1 and @xmath2 , although the method is easily generalized for the larger number of observables .",
    "in what follows , we assume that the primary energy estimate for the observed events is accurate at a few percent level .",
    "in fact , the primary energy estimator for kascade is @xmath5 - the total number of low energy ( @xmath6 gev ) muons collected in the interval of distances between 40 and 200 m from the shower core .",
    "it has been shown that this number depends just on the primary energy and not on the primary mass .",
    "the accuracy of the primary energy estimate in the knee region made with this parameter is determined mainly by the @xmath5 reconstruction error and is about 5% @xcite    the data set used to implement and test the new method consists of 20000 vertical cascades produced by particles with the fixed energy of 0.5 pev , 8000 cascades for 1 pev and 2000 cascades for 5 pev , simulated using the corsika program ( version 6.023 , @xcite ) with the qgsjet interaction model .",
    "simulations were performed using naples pcs .",
    "the primary nuclei were @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , each of them initiating 5000 , 2000 and 500 cascades for 0.5 , 1 and 5 pev primary energy respectively .",
    "the corsika output provides various characteristics of the shower : the total number of different particles , their lateral distribution and arrival times at different observation levels .",
    "the mta method , when applied to the simulated data , relies on a topological analysis of correlations between the most significant parameters of the shower development in the atmosphere . in principle",
    "this method could be used also with a greater number of parameters , however , in this paper we restrict ourself to the simple case of two parameters only : @xmath11 and @xmath12 - the total number of electrons and muons at the sea level .",
    "a scatter plot of these two parameters has been built using the @xmath13 showers for 0.5 pev , @xmath14 for 1 pev and @xmath15 for 5 pev primary energy .",
    "figure [ fig : mta1 ] shows the scatter plot for only proton and iron induced showers of 1 pev primary energy as well as their projected distributions .     vs. @xmath11 scatter plot for proton ( star ) and iron ( circle ) induced showers at 1 pev primary energy .",
    "b ) projected distributions of the scatter plot in ( a ) for protons ( dashed line ) and iron nuclei ( full line),title=\"fig:\",width=234 ]   vs. @xmath11 scatter plot for proton ( star ) and iron ( circle ) induced showers at 1 pev primary energy .",
    "b ) projected distributions of the scatter plot in ( a ) for protons ( dashed line ) and iron nuclei ( full line),title=\"fig:\",width=234 ]    it can be seen that the populations arising from two nuclei are quite well separated in the @xmath16 plane , but not in the projected one - dimensional plots . the scatter plot of four primary nuclei : @xmath17 and @xmath10 shows much less separation even in the two - dimensional plot .",
    "the idea of the mta method is to divide the entire area of the scatter plot into cells whose dimensions are defined by the accuracy with which the parameters can be measured . for this work , we adopted the accuracy and the size of the cell equal to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which corresponds to the experimental errors of kascade array @xcite .",
    "in each cell we can find the total number of showers n@xmath20 , as the sum of n@xmath21 , n@xmath22 , n@xmath23 and n@xmath24 showers induced by p , he , o and fe respectively , and then derive the associated frequencies : p@xmath21=n@xmath21/n@xmath20 , p@xmath22=n@xmath22/n@xmath20 , p@xmath23=n@xmath23/n@xmath20 and p@xmath24=n@xmath24/n@xmath20 which can be interpreted as the probability for a real shower falling into the @xmath25 cell to be initiated by proton , helium , oxygen or iron primary nuclei .",
    "in other words , in the case of an experimental data set of @xmath26 showers , it may be seen as composed of a mixture of n@xmath27 p@xmath28 proton showers , n@xmath27 p@xmath29 helium showers , n@xmath27 p@xmath30 oxygen showers and n@xmath27 p@xmath31 iron induced showers , where p@xmath32p@xmath33 . as a probe set of experimental showers 4 subsets of showers , different from those used for the determination of probabilities",
    "p@xmath34 , have been used .",
    "each subset consists of 500 showers for 0.5 pev , 200 showers for 1 pev and 50 showers for 5 pev primary energy . for each individual shower in a given subset the partial probabilities",
    "p@xmath35 , p@xmath36 , p@xmath37 and p@xmath38 have been read from the relevant cell _ i_. the sum of such probabilities over the entire subset permits to estimate the probability for a shower of a given nature to be identified as a shower generated by the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 primary particle .",
    "this probability is shown in figure [ fig : mta3 ] at e = 1 pev .",
    "one can see that the method works quite well being able to attribute the highest probability to the correct nuclei .",

    "i _ nucleus : p , he , o and fe ( specified in headers ) being identified as induced by _",
    "j _ nucleus , indicated at abscissa , at e = 1 pev.,height=377 ]",
    "the obtained mean probabilities @xmath39 for cascades induced by type @xmath40 nuclei to be identified as those induced by @xmath41 nuclei for the pure primary mass composition can be used for the reconstruction of the mixed primary mass composition as the coefficients in the system of linear equations :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the true numbers , which determine the primary mass composition in the sample of @xmath47 cascades , which are observed as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , due to a misclassification .    in order to invert the problem and to reconstruct the abundances @xmath52 in the primary mass composition from the observed abundances @xmath53 and the known probabilities @xmath39",
    ", we can apply any method capable to solve the inverse problem taking into account possible errors of the observed distribution and the constraint : @xmath54 the observed abundances were simulated using a set of 4@xmath55800 cascades different from those used for the determination of @xmath39 . at the moment",
    "the result of the solution for the uniform primary mass composition at e = 1 pev , with all abundances @xmath56 = 0.25 , reconstructed by mta method is @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    as an example of the non - uniform mass composition",
    "we have taken the case with @xmath61 = 0.1 , @xmath62 = 0.4 , which resembles the mass composition of cosmic rays at the knee energy of @xmath03 pev @xcite .",
    "the total amount of cascades used for the simulation of this distribution is 2000 ( 200 @xmath7 + 800 @xmath8 + 800 @xmath9 + 200 @xmath10 ) .",
    "the result of the solution for this case is @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 at e = 1 pev .",
    "it is seen that absolute values of the abundance are reconstructed satisfactorily .    for the time being the values of the probabilities @xmath39",
    "are assumed to be known precisely .",
    "a more accurate solution of the system , taking propely into account the errors of the probability , is under study .",
    "it has to be stressed that all the results outlined above are biased by the fact that we are dealing with simulated noiseless data and more realistic testing has to be performed using data which take into account the varying primary energy and inclination angle , the instrumental signature ( noise ) and the various sources of errors ( uneven and incomplete sampling , etc . ) .",
    "application of mta is straightforward - the relevant simulations should be made with the largest possible statistics .",
    "the preliminary study of the effect of the experimental errors shows rather strong dependence of the probabilities @xmath39 on the adopted errors . in figure",
    "[ fig : mta6 ] we show the probabilities @xmath67 for the correct identification of nuclei as a function of the primary energy .",
    "the experimental accuracies of the shower size determination have been taken as @xmath68 = 0.02 and @xmath69 = 0.05 .",
    "it is seen that while the energy dependence is week the reduction of probability @xmath67 is substantial .",
    "as the function of its energy without ( full circles ) and with ( open circles ) an account of experimental errors : @xmath68 = 0.02 and @xmath69 = 0.05 .",
    "the primary nuclei are : ( a)-p ; ( b)-he ; ( c)-o ; ( d)-fe.,width=359,height=359 ]",
    "we proposed and tested the multiparametric topological analysis method for the determination of the _ mean _ primary cosmic ray mass composition on the basis of measurements of just two parameters of the observed eas - the total number of electrons and muons .",
    "definitely the method needs further development before being used for the processing of real experimental cascades , but the first results are very encouraging .",
    "the next efforts should include the increase of simulation statistics , the study of the effect of the shower energy spectrum and angular distribution , the accurate estimate of the reconstruction errors .",
    "the great advantage of the proposed mta method is that it is extremely easy to use and generalize for the larger number of observables .",
