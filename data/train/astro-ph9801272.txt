    "barium stars were identified as a class of peculiar red giants by bidelman & keenan ( 1951 ) .",
    "typical chemical peculiarities exhibited by these g and k giants include overabundances of carbon and of elements heavier than fe , like ba and sr ( e.g. lambert 1985 ) .",
    "these elements bear the signature of the s - process of nucleosynthesis , a neutron - capture chain starting on fe seed nuclei and synthesizing nuclides heavier than fe located along the valley of nuclear stability ( burbidge et al .",
    "the operation of the s - process is commonly associated with he - burning thermal pulses occurring on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . as a result of the so - called ` third dredge - up '",
    ", s - process enriched material is brought to the surface of the agb star ( iben & renzini 1983 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1991 ) .",
    "barium stars , as well as their pop.ii counterparts , the ch stars ( first introduced by keenan in 1942 ) , are too warm and of too low a luminosity to have undergone third dredge - ups on the agb ( e.g. scalo 1976 ; bergeat & knapik 1997 ) . with the discovery of the binary nature of these stars ( mcclure et al .",
    "1980 ; mcclure 1983 ) , their chemical peculiarities have been attributed to mass transfer across the binary system . when the current wd companion of the barium star was a thermally - pulsing agb star , it transferred s - process- and c - rich material onto its companion , which is now viewed as a barium or ch star .    the exact way by which the matter was transferred from the agb star onto its companion  either by wind accretion in a detached binary , or by roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) in a semi - detached binary  is still a matter of debate . on one hand , the fact that barium stars have non - circular orbits points against rlof in a semi - detached system , as tidal effects will efficiently circularize the orbit when the giant is about to fill its roche lobe . but",
    "on the other hand , rlof seems unavoidable for the barium stars with the shortest periods , since their orbital separation is too small to have accomodated a large agb star in a detached binary system in the past ( see in particular the case of hd  121447 , having the second shortest orbital period among barium stars ; jorissen et al .",
    "the main difficulty with rlof is that , when this process involves a giant star with a convective envelope , it is expected to lead to a dramatic orbital shrinkage .",
    "this so - called ` case c ' mass transfer is dynamically unstable when the mass - loser is the more massive star in the system .",
    "a common envelope generally forms at that stage , causing a strong drag on the embedded stars ( e.g. meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1979 ; iben & tutukov 1993 ) . a way out of this dilemna has recently been proposed by han et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , by pointing out that , under some special conditions , the dynamical instability associated with case c mass transfer can be avoided .",
    "the present paper contains an extensive analysis of the orbital elements of barium stars , since the new orbits presented in companion papers ( udry et al .",
    "1998ab ) considerably enlarge the database , from the 17 orbits from mcclure & woodsworth ( 1990 ) that were available to han et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to more than 50 now .",
    "the binary evolution channels relevant for barium stars , as identified by han et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , will be confronted with our new data , with special emphasis on the  diagram .",
    "the number of available orbits is now large enough to perform a meaningful comparison of the period and mass - function distributions of strong and mild barium stars .    as far as s stars are concerned ,",
    "it has become clear that tc - rich and tc - poor s stars form two separate families with similar chemical peculiarities albeit of very different origins ( iben & renzini 1983 ; little et al .",
    "1987 ; jorissen & mayor 1988 ; smith & lambert 1988 ; brown et al . 1990 ; johnson 1992 ; jorissen & mayor 1992 ; groenewegen 1993 ; johnson et al . 1993 ; jorissen et al . 1993 ; ake 1997 ) .",
    "tc - rich ( or ` intrinsic ' ) s stars are genuine thermally - pulsing agb stars where the s - process operates in relation with the thermal pulses , and where the third dredge - up brings the freshly synthesized s - elements ( including tc ) to the surface ( e.g. iben & renzini 1983 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1991 ) .",
    "by contrast , tc - poor ( or ` extrinsic ' ) s stars are believed to be the cool descendants of barium stars .",
    "the evolutionary link between barium and s stars is discussed in the light of the 25 orbits now available for s stars , and appears to be fully confirmed .",
    "finally , we present some suggestions to solve the dilemna expressed above about the mass transfer mode that operated in barium and extrinsic s stars .",
    "radial - velocity monitoring of several samples of chemically - peculiar red giants ( prg ) has been performed by the team of mcclure at the dominion astrophysical observatory ( dao , canada ) and by the coravel team on the swiss 1-m telescope at haute - provence observatory ( france ) and on the danish 1.54-m telescope at the european southern observatory ( la silla , chile ) , with the aim of deriving their binary frequencies .",
    "a detailed description of the coravel data , along with the new orbits , is given in two companion papers ( udry et al .",
    "1998ab ; see baranne et al .",
    "1979 for a description of the coravel spectro - velocimeter ) .",
    "a brief description of these samples , on which the present study relies , is given below , with special emphasis on their statistical significance .",
    "the coravel and dao samples taken together contain _ all 34 known barium stars with strong anomalies _",
    "( i.e. ba4 or ba5 on the scale defined by warner 1965 ) from the list of l et al .",

    "[ sect : frequency ] thus allows us to address the question of whether binarity is a necessary condition to form a strong barium star .",

    "the coravel sample is a random selection of 33 ba@xmath51 , ba1 and a few ba2 stars from the list of l et al .",
    "although this sample is by no means complete , it provides a good comparison to the sample of strong barium stars described above , for investigating the correlation between the orbital elements and the intensity of the chemical anomaly .    because orbital elements for barium stars are spread in the literature , tables  1a and 2a collect all orbital elements available for mild and strong barium stars , respectively . the number in column ` ref .

    "besides the orbit obtained for the s star hr 1105 ( = hd 22649 ) by griffin ( 1984 ) , our coravel monitoring of a sample of 56 s stars is the primary source for investigating the binary frequency among s stars .",

    "all three stars appear to be truly mild barium stars despite the absence of radial - velocity variations .",
    "the results of the radial velocity monitoring of s stars are presented in table  3 , which has been subdivided in the following way : ( a ) s stars for which an orbit or a lower limit on the orbital period is available ; ( b ) s stars with no radial - velocity variations ; ( c ) s stars with radial - velocity variations but no clear evidence for orbital motion ; ( d ) mira s stars ; ( e ) sc stars .",
    "this partition is motivated by the fact that s stars generally exhibit some radial - velocity jitter very likely due to envelope pulsation , that complicates the search for binaries .",

    "this particular choice for the @xmath9 threshold is motivated by the fact that on fig .",
    "[ fig : sbjitter ] , tc - poor s stars ( that are expected to belong to binary systems ) are restricted to @xmath78  . the method has not been applied to mira s stars because of the uncertain ( and probably large ) radial - velocity jitter affecting these stars ( sects .",

    "the main difficulty of the monte - carlo method outlined in sect .",
    "[ sect : montecarlo ] is that the _ real _ distributions of period , eccentricity and @xmath79 are not completely known , since the very detection biases we want to evaluate render the _ observed _ distributions incomplete .",

    "as seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : isoproba ] , the detection probability drops tremendously for @xmath83  d , because of the finite timespan of the observations , which started in 1985 for most strong barium stars , and in 1986 for most mild barium and s stars . for s stars ,",

    "an unfavorable spatial or temporal orientation of the binary system is the only possible cause of non - detection .",

    "its long - period tail includes the @xmath84 stars having no orbital period currently available ( i.e. stars with only a lower limit available on @xmath45 , or even stars with constant radial velocities ) but assumed to be very long - period binaries .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath85 stars are uniformly redistributed over the period bins ranging from @xmath86 to 20000 d , where @xmath87 is the first period bin containing a star from the @xmath85 subsample .",
    "eccentricities are supposed to be uniformly distributed under the curve @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding binary detection rates are listed in table  [ tab : montecarlo ] under item monte - carlo ( iii ) .",
    "+ what are the main causes of non - detection ? in the case of mild barium stars for example ,",
    "the non - detected binaries in simulation ( iii ) are distributed as follows , in decreasing order of importance : @xmath89 for 47.3% , @xmath90d for 32.7% , @xmath91 for 20.7% ( because the radial - velocity curve remains very flat over a large fraction of the orbital cycle around apastron ) , @xmath92 for 4.5% , and a combination of various less severe conditions for 9.8% .",
    "note that , since a star may belong to more than one of these categories , the sum of the above percentages exceeds 100% . in more practical terms , these numbers translate into 6.6% of the undetected binaries having a radial - velocity semi - amplitude @xmath93  too small in comparison with the instrumental accuracy , while 37.8% remained undetected because of an incomplete phase coverage ( @xmath94 ) and 26.6% because the number of measurements is too small ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the detection rates obtained for the various cases considered in sect .  [ sect : peq ] are summarized in table  [ tab : montecarlo ] , where they are compared with the observed rates .",

    "one may therefore conclude that _ binarity is a necessary condition to produce chemically - peculiar red giants like mild and strong ba stars_. the agreement is slightly better for the monte - carlo simulation ( iii ) extrapolating the period distribution up to 20000  d. the few barium stars with undetected radial - velocity variations are thus likely binaries with very long periods or with unfavourably - oriented orbits .",
    "the situation is more tricky for s stars .",
    "the application of the monte - carlo method to the _ whole _ sample of s stars is hampered by our ignorance of the exact amount of jitter in the radial velocities of mira stars with large @xmath9 indices ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sbjitter ] ) . therefore the monte - carlo simulation can not be used to evaluate the rate of binaries among the whole sample of s stars ( as we did for barium stars ) .",
    "the problem is less severe for s stars with @xmath78 , where the jitter is smaller ( @xmath97 ) and may be estimated with more confidence .",
    "moreover , the fact that tc - poor s stars ( i.e. extrinsic s stars suspected of belonging to binary systems ) appear to be restricted to @xmath78  provides an independent justification for applying the monte - carlo simulation to that subsample . the observed binary rate for s stars with @xmath78  is close to the one predicted with the extrapolated @xmath45 and @xmath46 distributions ( case iii in table  [ tab : montecarlo ] ) .",
    "this result is thus consistent with the hypothesis that all s stars with @xmath78  are members of binary systems [ note that , for s stars , the case ( iii ) predictions have to be preferred over the case ( ii ) ones , since the period distribution of s stars is most probably incomplete at large periods , due to a more limited time coverage than in the case of barium stars ] .",
    "however , this agreement should not be overinterpreted , as the @xmath98  limit between extrinsic and intrinsic s stars may be somewhat fuzzy .    are there binaries in our sample of intrinsic s stars ? for these stars ,",
    "the intrinsic jitter may possibly induce variations of the same order of magnitude as those caused by binarity , and thus renders the detection of possible binaries very delicate .",
    "however , several arguments indicate that binary stars are probably not very frequent among the intrinsic s stars of our sample .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : histosigvr ] shows the distribution of the radial - velocities standard deviation @xmath99 _ predicted _ by the monte - carlo simulation for a sample of binary stars having orbital parameters matching those of the binary s stars , and with an intrinsic jitter of 1  .",
    "as expected , the _ observed _ @xmath99 distribution for binary s stars ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : histosigvr ] ) matches the simulated distribution ( allowing for large statistical fluctuations due to the small number of stars observed ) . on the contrary , the observed @xmath99 distribution for mira s stars ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : histosigvr ] ) differs markedly from that of binary s stars , since the former distribution peaks at @xmath100  and is rapidly falling off at larger @xmath99 .",
    "the paucity of mira s stars with @xmath101   must therefore reflect the low percentage of binaries among this group .",
    "the minimum value of the jitter ( 1 ) adopted in the simulation is a conservative choice ; a larger jitter would shift the simulated @xmath99 distribution ( upper panel ) towards larger @xmath99 values , thus strengthening the above conclusion .    although binarity is not required to produce intrinsic s stars and",
    "is indeed not frequent in the sample considered in this paper , binary stars may nevertheless exist among them as in any class of stars .",

    "a striking feature of this diagram is the relative paucity of systems with @xmath103 and orbital periods longer than 350  d. a similar lack of circular systems is observed among binary systems involving solar - type main - sequence primaries ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; duquennoy et al .",
    "1992 ) , the threshold period ( 10  d ) being much shorter in this case . on the contrary , many systems with periods shorter than this threshold have circular orbits .",

    "tidal effects on the more evolved component nearly filling its roche lobe are responsible for the circularization of the closest binaries in a given ( coeval ) sample .",

    "still , it is important to note that quite large eccentricities ( @xmath106 , hd  123949 ) are found among barium stars , yet at large periods ( @xmath107  d ) .",
    "the  diagrams of s and ch stars , and their threshold periods @xmath108 and @xmath109 in particular , are very similar to those of barium stars .",
    "the differences between the  diagrams of prg and cluster binaries reflect the fact that the orbits of prg systems have been shaped by the mass - transfer process responsible for their chemical peculiarities , whereas most of the cluster binaries are probably pre - mass transfer binaries .",
    "the  diagram of prg stars may also have been altered to some extent by tidal effects occurring in more recent phases ( e.g. , when low - mass barium stars currently in the clump evolved up the rgb ) , thus complicating its interpretation in terms of mass - transfer only ( see sect .",

    "tout & eggleton ( 1988 ) have shown that the mass ratio is easily reversed if the mass loss rate of the agb star is tidally enhanced by the companion ( ` companion - reinforced attrition process ' , crap ) so to exceed the reimers rate by one or two orders of magnitude . by including this effect , han et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were able to stabilize the rlof of many systems , which ended up as barium systems with periods in the range 250  2500  d.    finally , the very concept of the roche lobe may be irrelevant for systems involving a mass - losing star where the wind - driving force may substantially reduce the effective gravity of the mass - losing star ( see the discussion in theuns & jorissen 1993 ) .",
    "the existence of an extra - force driving the mass loss will clearly modify the shape of the equipotential surfaces , as shown by schuerman ( 1972 ) .",
    "the geometry of x - ray binaries involving mass - losing supergiants ( bolton 1975 ; kondo et al .",
    "1976 ) , and possibly also of the yellow symbiotic - barium star bd@xmath213 ( smith et al . 1997 ) , are indeed observed to deviate from the predictions made with the usual jacobi integral describing the restricted three - body equipotential surfaces .",
    "in particular , if the effective gravity is reduced below some threshold depending upon the mass ratio , the critical roche equipotential will degenerate into a surface including _ both _ the lagrangian points @xmath214 and @xmath215 ( if the mass - losing star is the more massive component ) or @xmath214 and @xmath216 ( in the opposite case ) .",
    "matter will thus not necessarily be confined to the lobe surrounding the accreting component , but may escape from the system through @xmath215 or @xmath216 , after forming a circumbinary disk .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a strong wind , the particles have initially non - zero kinetic energy taken from the internal energy of the mass - losing star , that makes the equipotentials escapable barriers .",
    "therefore , only a limited fraction of the mass lost by the agb star is accreted by the companion , and such a reduced accretion rate will be less prone to trigger the expansion of the accreting star envelope , at the origin of the common envelope formation .",
    "the mass flows in these situations are complex , as shown by recent _",
    "smooth particle hydrodynamics _ simulations ( theuns & jorissen 1993 ; theuns et al .",
    "the orbital properties of s stars appear to be identical to those of barium stars , as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : elogp ] [ @xmath217 diagram ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : fmchba ] and [ fig : fmsbas ] ( mass - function distribution ) .",
    "this similarity is a strong indication that binary s stars are simply the descendants of barium stars as they cool while ascending either the rgb or the e - agb . because the evolution is slower on the rgb than on the e - agb , it",
    "may actually be expected that binary s stars be dominated by stars on the upper rgb rather than on the e - agb . in this case , _ they ought to be low - mass stars _ ( because only low - mass stars develop a red giant branch ) , in agreement with the value 1.6  derived from their average @xmath79 ( table  [ tab : fm ] ) .",
    "it is expected that at some point in their evolution on the rgb the s stars with the shortest periods ( @xmath218  d ) will overflow their roche lobe . in that respect , it should be noted that the hottest ( i.e. least evolved ) s star in our sample , hd 121447 , has the shortest period among s stars .",
    "the detailed analysis of this system performed by jorissen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) concludes that the giant will overflow its roche lobe before reaching the rgb - tip , with a dramatic fate for the binary system as described in sect .",
    "[ sect : rlof ] in relation with unstable case c mass transfer .",
    "the various processes that prevented the orbital decay of the binary system in a former stage of its evolution , when the agb progenitor of the present wd filled its roche lobe , are no longer applicable to this second rlof event .",
    "first , the mass ratio can no longer be inverted easily , as the companion is already a low - mass wd , so that case c mass transfer is necessarily dynamically unstable .",
    "second , the envelope of a rgb star is more tightly bound than that of an evolved agb star ( since it is less extended and its ` gravity - reducing ' wind is much weaker ) , so that more energy has to be extracted from the orbit to expell the common envelope , resulting in a stronger orbital decay .",
    "a lack of short - period s systems is predicted from these considerations , as already suspected by jorissen & mayor ( 1992 ) .",
    "this effect is not immediately apparent from the comparison between the cumulative period distributions of barium and s stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ) . however , there are good reasons to suspect that the two shortest - period s systems , hd  121447 and hd  191589 , are peculiar in some respect ( hd  121447 : see above ; hd 191589 is a puzzling tc - poor s star with an a - type companion , see sect .",
    "[ sect : fms ] ) .",
    "if these special cases are removed from the sample of s stars , s systems with @xmath218  d appear to be lacking , in agreement with the critical periods expected for rlof on the upper rgb ( see table  5 of jorissen & mayor 1992 ) .",
    "possible links between the prg families considered in this paper and symbiotic stars , post - agb stars and dwarf barium stars are briefly considered in this section .",
    "most barium stars may be expected to form as dwarf stars , since the stellar lifetime is longer on the main sequence than on the giant branch , and since the cross section for wind accretion is independent of the geometric radius of the star according to the bondi - hoyle formula ( eq .  [ eq : beta1 ] ) .",
    "dwarf barium stars long remained elusive , until luck & bond ( 1982 , 1991 ) and north et al .",
    "( 1994 ) recognized that some of the ch subgiants previously identified by bond ( 1974 ) , as well as some of the f dwarfs previously classified by bidelman ( 1985 ) as having a ` strong sr @xmath219 ' line , had the proper abundance anomalies , gravities and galactic frequencies to be identified with the long- sought ba dwarfs .",
    "a large fraction of binaries ( about 90% ) has been found among the stars with strong anomalies , as expected ( mcclure 1985 ; north et al .",
    "the suspected wd companions to these dwarf barium stars appear to be too cool to be detectable with the iue satellite ( bond 1984 ; north & lanz 1991 ) .    on the contrary , it is the presence of a hot wd companion to the k dwarf 2re j0357 + 283 that led jeffries & stevens ( 1996 ) to suspect it might be a dwarf barium star . a subsequent spectroscopic analysis ( jeffries & smalley 1996 ) confirmed this early suspicion .",
    "this star is the first example of the new class of wirring ( ` wind - induced rapidly rotating ' ) stars , that have been spun up by wind accretion , as predicted by sph simulations ( theuns et al .",
    "1996 ) . the giant barium star hd  165141 , which has a hot wd companion as well ( fekel et al .",
    "1993 ) , is another member of that class ( jorissen et al .",
    "1996 ) .      the post - agb stars with large fe deficiencies studied by van winckel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are all binaries , and their @xmath217 diagram is very similar to that of barium stars ( van winckel et al .",
    "these post - agb stars could be related to barium stars , were it not for the absence of clear evidence for s - process enrichment of these stars ( van winckel 1995 ) .",
    "symbiotic systems consist of a late - type giant and a hot companion , a wd in most cases , exhibiting nebular lines in their spectra ( e.g. kenyon 1986 ) .",
    "yellow symbiotics involve a g or k giant and are often halo objects ( schmid & nussbaumer 1993 ) .",
    "many exhibit the barium syndrome ( uks - ce1 and s32 : schmid 1994 ; ag dra : smith et al .",
    "1996 ; bd@xmath213 : smith et al .",
    "1997 ) , which must have formed in much the same way as in barium and s systems .",
    "these yellow symbiotics are probably evolving on the upper rgb or on the e - agb , thus being the pop.ii counterparts of the extrinsic s stars , whereas the hotter ch stars would be the analogs of the barium stars .",
    "a more detailed comparison can be found in jorissen ( 1997 ) .",
    "radial - velocity monitoring of a complete sample of barium stars with strong anomalies reveals that 35 out of 37 stars show clear evidence of binary motion . for mild barium stars ,",
    "that frequency amounts to 34/40 ( or 37/40 if one includes the suspected binaries ) .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation shows that these frequencies are compatible with the hypothesis that _ all _ the observed stars are binary systems , some of them remaining undetected because of unfavourable orbital orientation or time sampling .",
    "we conclude therefore that there is no need to invoke a barium - star formation mechanism other than one ( like mass transfer ) directly related to the binary nature of these stars . in other words , _ binarity appears to be a necessary condition to form a barium star_. it seems , however , that it is not a sufficient condition , since binary systems with barium - like orbital elements but no heavy - element overabundances seem to exist ( e.g. dr dra ) .",
    "it has been argued that a metallicity lower than solar may be the other parameter required to form a barium star .",
    "the increasing levels of heavy - element overabundances observed in the sequence mild ba ",
    "strong ba ",
    "ch stars support that hypothesis , since this sequence is also one of increasing age ( and thus , to first order , of decreasing metallicity ) , as revealed by their kinematical properties .",
    "the @xmath217 diagram of prg stars clearly shows the signature of mass transfer , since the maximum eccentricity observed at a given orbital period is much smaller than in a comparison sample of normal giants in clusters .",
    "mass transfer rather than some non - standard internal mixing induced by binarity must thus be held responsible for the chemical peculiarities exhibited by prg stars .",
    "a distinctive feature of the  diagram of barium stars is the presence of two distinct modes : a short - period mode ( @xmath115  d ) comprising nearly - circular orbits ( @xmath220 ) , populated by strong barium stars only , and a long - period mode made exclusively of non - circular orbits . at this point , it is not clear whether the nearly circular orbits of the short - period mode bear the signature of rlof , or whether they arise from tidal circularization on the rgb long after the mass - transfer process .",
    "detailed models of binary evolution are required to answer that question .",
    "the comparison of the mass - function distributions of mild and strong barium stars confirms that the difference between them is mainly one of galactic population rather than of orbital separation , since mild barium stars host more massive giants than strong barium stars .",
    "the loose correlation that is observed between the orbital period and the level of heavy - element overabundances is another indication that a parameter not directly related to the orbital dynamics has a strong impact on the pollution level of the barium star .",
    "all these facts fit together nicely if the s - process operation is more efficient in a low - metallicity population .",
    "provided that the reaction @xmath221 is the neutron source responsible for the operation of the s - process , such a correlation between metallicity and s - process efficiency is indeed predicted on very general theoretical grounds . in this framework ,",
    "the giant star in pop.ii ch systems has accreted material much enriched in heavy elements by its former agb companion .",
    "therefore , stars of old , low - metallicity populations like ch stars ( and to a lesser extent , strong barium stars ) exhibit , _ for a given orbital period _ , much larger heavy - element overabundances than stars belonging to a younger population .",
    "a radial - velocity monitoring of s stars confirms that tc - poor s stars are all binaries and are the cool descendants of the barium stars on the rgb or e - agb , since they have similar orbital periods and mass functions .",
    "there is a suggestion , however , that the short - period tail of s stars may be truncated at about 600  d due to rlof occurring on the upper rgb .",
    "similarly , for pop.ii stars , yellow barium - symbiotic systems like ag dra and bd@xmath2223873 are the cool descendants of the hotter ch stars .",
    "two tc - poor s stars , hde 332077 and hd 191589 , have unusually large mass functions , and an a - type companion has been detected in both cases with iue , as well as in 57 peg ( van eck et al .",
    "the evolutionary status of these stars is currently unclear .",

    "to be able to compare in a homogeneous way the level of chemical peculiarities in different barium stars is clearly of paramount importance when trying to identify the mass transfer scenario that operated in these stars .",
    "a key constraint may indeed be obtained by assessing whether or not there is a correlation between the level of chemical peculiarities and some dynamical parameter like the orbital period . as detailed abundance analyses are only available for a small subset of barium stars ,",
    "the aim of this appendix is to design a photometric index available for ( nearly ) all barium stars and probing their chemical peculiarities .",
    "( 1983 ) and l ( 1991 ) pointed out that barium stars segregate according to their ba index ( as defined in the scale of warner 1965 from visual inspection of the strength of the ba@xmath223 line ) in the @xmath224 $ ] color - color diagram constructed from ddo photometric indices ( see mcclure & van den bergh 1968 ) .",
    "this segregation is caused by the so - called bond - neff depression , a broad absorption feature present in the spectrum of barium stars and extending from about 350 to 450  nm ( bond & neff 1969 ; l & sawyer 1979 ) .",
    "a veil of many heavy - element lines has been proposed as the origin of this broad feature ( mcwilliam & smith 1984 ; wing 1985 , and references therein ) , though that issue is still controversial as cn bands are also important contributors in this spectral region ( tripicco & bell 1991 ) .          according to these findings",

    "mcwilliam ( 1988 , 1990 ) showed that the abundance ratio yii / tiii , derived from the yii @xmath228 and tiii @xmath229 lines , is a powerful indicator for detecting heavy - element abundance peculiarities in red giants , since ( i ) that abundance ratio is relatively insensitive to the atmospheric parameters , and ( ii ) the distribution of yii / tiii ratios in a sample of about 600 g ",
    "k giants is very narrow , with a fwhm of only 0.3  dex centered at log(yii / tiii ) @xmath230 ( adopted as normalization value for [ yii / tiii ] in the following ) .",
    "the @xmath25 index has therefore been calibrated in terms of [ yii / tiii ] abundances , using 131 g and k giants for which both ddo colors ( mcclure & forrester 1981 ) and abundances ( mcwilliam 1990 ) are available . +          the value @xmath231 is obtained by requiring maximum linear correlation between [ y / ti ] and @xmath25 for that sample , and @xmath232 ensures that barium stars have @xmath233 , whereas nearly all normal giants have @xmath26 ( fig .",

    "the two stars ( hr  7754 and hr  8590 ) in region  ( ii ) were not previously identified as barium stars .",
    "hr  7754 is in fact present in the list of mk standards provided by keenan & mcneil ( 1989 ) , and there is no mention whatsoever of the barium nature of that star , classified as g9iii .",
