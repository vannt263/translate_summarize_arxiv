    "we are rapidly approaching the era of advanced gravitational - wave detectors . advanced ligo  @xcite and advanced virgo  @xcite are expected to begin operation in 2015 . within the next decade , these will be joined by the kagra  @xcite and ligo - india  @xcite detectors .",
    "the coalescence of compact binaries containing neutron stars and/or stellar mass black holes are expected to be a strong and promising source for the first detection of gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "higher mass sources with total masses @xmath0m@xmath1 including binary black holes ( bbhs ) and intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) are less certain but still potentially strong sources  @xcite .",
    "discovery and new science will be possible with detection of gravitational waves from these objects  @xcite .",
    "measurement of gravitational waves requires exquisitely sensitive detectors as well as advanced data analysis techniques  @xcite . by digging into detector noise for weak signals rather than waiting for a rare , loud event , we increase detection rates .",
    "unfortunately , detector noise can be non - stationary and non - gaussian , leading to loud , short duration noise transients .",
    "such behavior is particularly troublesome for higher mass searches where the expected in - band signal is of similar duration as noise transients .",
    "traditional searches for compact binary coalescence have utilized multi - detector coincidence , carefully designed ranking statistics , and other data quality methods  @xcite . however , in many searches performed to - date over initial ligo and virgo data , the sensitivity was limited by an accidental coincidence involving a non - gaussian transient noise burst  @xcite .",
    "only recently have gravitational - wave searches begun to utilize methods that work with the full multidimensional parameter space of classification statistics for candidate events .",
    "previous studies have shown multivariate methods give detection probability improvement over techniques based on single parameter thresholds  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "machine learning has a wealth of tools available for the purpose of multivariate statistical classification  @xcite .",
    "these include but are not limited to artificial neural networks  @xcite , support vector machines  @xcite , and random forests of decision trees  @xcite . such methods have already proven useful in a number of other fields with large data sets and background contamination including optical and radio astronomy  @xcite and high energy physics  @xcite . within the field of gravitational wave physics , a search for gravitational - wave bursts associated with gamma ray bursts found a factor of @xmath93 increase in sensitive volume when using a multivariate analysis with boosted decision trees  @xcite .",
    "applications of artificial neural networks to a search for compact binary coalescence signals associated with gamma ray bursts found smaller improvements  @xcite .",
    "machine learning algorithms have successfully been applied to the problem of detector noise artifact classification  @xcite . additionally , a search for bursts of gravitational waves from cosmic string cusps  @xcite used the multivariate technique described in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the development and sensitivity improvements of a multivariate analysis applied to matched filter searches for gravitational waves produced by coalescing black hole binaries with total masses @xmath0m@xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we focus on the application to two separate searches in this parameter space .",
    "the first , designated the imr search , looks for gravitational waves from the inspiral , merger , and ringdown of bbhs with total mass between @xmath3m@xmath1 and @xmath4m@xmath1 .",
    "the second , designated the ringdown - only search , looks for gravitational waves from the resultant perturbed imbh with mass roughly between @xmath6m@xmath1 and @xmath7m@xmath1 .",
    "these investigations are performed over data collected by ligo and virgo between 2009 and 2010 so that comparisons can be made with previous imr and ringdown - only search results  @xcite . using a random forest of bagged decision trees ( rfbdt ) supervised machine learning algorithm ( mla ) , we explore sensitivity improvements over each search s previous classification statistic . additionally , we describe techniques used to tune and train the rfbdt classifier that can be generalized to its use in other searches for gravitational waves .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "searches for gravitational waves are generally divided based on astrophysical source .",
    "the gravitational waveform from compact binary coalescence has a well - defined model  @xcite .",
    "thus searches for these types of signals use the method of matched - filtering with a template bank of model waveforms .",
    "this is the optimal method for finding modeled signals with known parameters buried in gaussian noise  @xcite .",
    "however , if the parameters are not known , matched filtering is not optimal  @xcite , and additional techniques must be employed to address the extraction of weak and/or rare signals from non - gaussian , non - stationary detector noise , the elimination or identification of false alarms , and the ranking of gravitational - wave candidates by significance .",
    "this paper presents the construction of an _ ad hoc _ statistic , automated through machine learning , that can tackle these issues .",
    "the coalescence of compact binaries generates a gravitational - wave signal composed of inspiral , merger and ringdown phases  @xcite .",
    "the low frequency inspiral phase marks the period during which the compact objects orbit each other , radiating energy and angular momentum as gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "the signal for low mass systems in the ligo and virgo frequency sensitivity bands ( i.e. , above the steeply rising seismic noise at 40hz for initial detectors or 10hz for advanced detectors  @xcite ) is dominated by the inspiral phase .",
    "several searches have looked for the inspiral from low mass systems with component masses @xmath10m@xmath1 and total mass @xmath11m@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the higher frequency merger phase marks the coalescence of the compact objects and the peak gravitational - wave emission  @xcite .",
    "since the merger frequency is inversely proportional to the mass of the binary , the signal for high mass systems in the ligo and virgo sensitivity bands could include inspiral , merger and ringdown phases .",
    "searches for high mass signals including all three phases have been performed for systems with total mass between 25@xmath12m@xmath1 and 100@xmath12m@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we designate this as the imr search .",
    "systems accessible to ligo and virgo with even higher total masses will only have a ringdown phase in - band , during which the compact objects have already formed a single perturbed black hole  @xcite .",
    "searches for ringdown signals have looked for perturbed black holes with total masses roughly in the range 10@xmath12m@xmath1 to 600@xmath12m@xmath1 and dimensionless spins in the range 0 to 0.99  @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless spin is defined as @xmath13 for black hole mass @xmath14 and spin angular momentum @xmath15 .",
    "we designate this as the ringdown - only search .",
    "each of these searches use a matched - filter algorithm with template banks of model waveforms to search data from multiple gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "the output is a snr time series for each detector .",
    "we record local maxima , called triggers , in the snr time series that fall above a predetermined threshold .",
    "low mass searches use template banks of inspiral model waveforms generated at 3.5 post - newtonian order in the frequency domain  @xcite .",
    "these waveforms typically remain in the initial ligo / virgo frequency sensitivity band for tens of seconds providing a natural defense against triggers arising from short bursts of non - gaussian noise .",
    "the templates for imr searches include the full inspiral - merger - ringdown waveform , computed analytically and tuned against numerical relativity results .",
    "for these investigations , the non - spinning eobnrv1 family of imr waveforms was used  @xcite .",
    "the templates , like those for the low mass search , are described by the chirp mass @xmath16 and symmetric mass ratio @xmath17 of the component objects ( where @xmath18 )  @xcite .",
    "the duration of high mass waveforms in - band for the initial detectors is much shorter than the duration for low mass waveforms , making the imr search susceptible to triggers associated with short bursts of non - gaussian noise .",
    "the templates for the search for perturbed black holes , with even higher total mass , is based on black hole perturbation theory and numerical relativity .",
    "a perturbed kerr black hole will emit gravitational waves in a superposition of quasinormal modes of oscillation characterized by a frequency @xmath19 and damping time @xmath20",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated that the @xmath21 dominates the gravitational - wave emission  @xcite . from here on , we will designate @xmath22 as @xmath23 and write the damping time @xmath24 in terms of the quality factor @xmath25 .",
    "ringdown model waveforms decay on the timescale @xmath26 , again making this search susceptible to contamination from short noise bursts .",
    "the matched - filter algorithms are described in @xcite .",
    "further details on the templates and template bank construction in the imr and ringdown - only searches can be found in @xcite .",
    "matched filtering alone can not completely distinguish triggers caused by gravitational waves from those caused by noise .",
    "thus tools such as data quality vetoes , multi - detector coincidence , and snr consistency checks are needed  @xcite .",
    "additionally , a @xmath27 time - frequency signal consistency test augments searches with broadband signal including the imr search but is less useful for short , quasi - monochromatic ringdown signals  @xcite .",
    "finally , each search uses a detection statistic to summarize the separation of signal from background .",
    "details on the construction of a detection statistic are provided in section  [ sec : detstat ] .",
    "in general , coincidence tests are applied to single detector triggers to check for multi - detector consistency .",
    "the low and high mass searches use an ellipsoidal coincidence test ( _ ethinca _",
    "@xcite ) that requires consistent values of template masses and time of arrival .",
    "the ringdown - only search coincidence test similarly calculates the distance @xmath28 between two triggers by checking simultaneously for time and template coincidence ( d@xmath29 and d@xmath30 )  @xcite .",
    "when three detectors are operating , if each pair of triggers passes the coincidence test , we store a triple coincidence .",
    "we also store double coincidences for particular network configurations as outlined in section  [ sec : data ] .      evaluating the performance of a detection statistic and training the machine learning classifier",
    "require the calculation of detection efficiency at an allowed level of background contamination .",
    "in the absence of actual gravitational - wave events , we determine detection efficiency through the use of simulated signals (  injections \" ) added to the detectors data streams .",
    "to estimate the search background , we generate a set of accidental coincidences using the method of time - shifted data .",
    "the simulated signal set is added to the data and a separate search is run .",
    "triggers are recorded corresponding to times when injections were made .",
    "the simulated signals are representative of the expected gravitational waveforms detectable by a search . for the imr and ringdown - only searches ,",
    "the simulated signals include waveforms from the eobnrv2 family  @xcite for systems whose component objects are not spinning and from the imrphenomb family  @xcite for systems whose component objects have aligned , anti - aligned , or no spins . additionally , for the ringdown - only search , we inject ringdown - only waveforms . for a discussion of injection waveform parameters ,",
    "see section  [ sec : sigtraining ] .",
    "considerations for the injection sets used in training the classifier are discussed in section  [ sec : training ] and in computing search sensitivity are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the background rate of accidental trigger coincidence between detectors is evaluated using the method of time - shifted data .",
    "we shift the data by intervals of time longer than the light travel time between detectors and then perform a separate search .",
    "any multi - detector coincidence found in the time - shifted search is very likely due to non - gaussian glitches .",
    "we perform searches over 100 sets of time - shifted data and recorded the accidental coincidences found by the algorithm .",
    "details of the method are provided in section  iiib of  @xcite and iiic of  @xcite . for a discussion of the set of accidental coincidences used in training the classifier ,",
    "see section  [ sec : training ] .",
    "we performed investigations using data collected by the ligo and virgo detectors between july 2009 and october 2010  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", we designate this time as period  2 to distinguish it from the analysis of period  1 data collected between november 2005 and september 2007 . all results reported here consider only period  2 data . for continuity",
    ", we will continue to designate our data analysis time as period  2 .",
    "period  2 covers ligo s sixth science run  @xcite . during this time , the @xmath31 km detectors in hanford , washington ( h1 ) and in livingston , louisiana ( l1 ) were operating .",
    "the @xmath32 km virgo detector ( v1 ) in cascina , italy conducted its second and third science run during this time  @xcite .",
    "the investigations were performed using data from the coincident search networks of the h1l1v1 , h1l1 , h1v1 , and l1v1 detectors .",
    "coincidences were stored for all triple and double detector combinations .",
    "data was analyzed separately using the imr and the ringdown - only search pipelines from the analyses reported in  @xcite and  @xcite . in order to combat noise transients , three levels of data quality vetoes",
    "are applied to remove noise from ligo - virgo data when searches are performed .",
    "details of vetoes are provided in  @xcite and specific descriptions of the use of the vetoes for these period  2 analyses can be found in @xcite .",
    "we analyze the performance of rfbdt classification after the first and second veto levels have been applied and compare this to the performance after the first , second , and third veto levels have been applied .",
    "after removal of the first and second veto levels , we were left with 0.48 years of analysis time and after additional removal of the third veto level , we were left with 0.42 years of analysis time .",
    "we designate the search over period  2 after the removal of the first and second veto levels as veto level  2 and after the removal of the first , second , and third veto levels as veto level  3 .    in order to capture the variability of detector noise and sensitivity",
    ", we divided period  2 into separate analysis periods of @xmath91 to 2 months .",
    "we then estimated the volume to which each search was sensitive by injecting simulated waveforms into the data and testing our ability to recover them .",
    "details of the method are provided in section  v of  @xcite .",
    "we repeat this procedure in section  [ sec : results ] in order to quantify the improvement in sensitive volume obtained by each search over ligo and virgo data from 2009 to 2010 when using rfbdts .",
    "we must rank all coincidences based on their likelihood of being a signal .",
    "gravitational - wave data analysis has no dearth of statistics to classify gravitational - wave candidates as signal or background , and often , the ranking statistic will be empirically designed as a composite of other statistics .",
    "if the noise in the detector data was gaussian , a matched - filter snr would be a sufficient ranking statistic .",
    "however , since detector noise is non - gaussian and non - stationary , we often re - weight the snr by additional statistics that improve our ability to distinguish signal from background .",
    "the exact form will depend on the nature of the signal for which we are searching .",
    "a good statistic for differentiating long inspirals may not work well for short ringdowns .",
    "searches for low mass binaries have ranked candidates using matched - filter snr weighted by the @xmath27 signal consistency test value ( e.g. , _ effective _ snr  @xcite and _ new _",
    "snr  @xcite ) .",
    "imr searches have used similar statistics  @xcite .",
    "previous ringdown - only searches and studies have used snr - based statistics to address the non - gaussianity of the data without the use of additional signal - based waveform consistency tests ( e.g. , the chopped - l statistic for double  @xcite and triple  @xcite coincident triggers ) . however , ranking statistics can be constructed using multivariate techniques to incorporate the full discriminatory power of the multidimensional parameter space of gravitational - wave candidates .",
    "several searches have utilized this including  @xcite . in section  [ sec : mla ] , we detail the implementation of a multivariate statistical classifier using rfbdts for the most recent imr and ringdown - only searches .",
    "the final statistic used to rank candidates in order of significance is known as a detection statistic .",
    "we combine the ranking statistics for each trigger into a coincident statistic ( i.e. , a statistic that incorporates information from all detectors triggers found in coincidence ) .",
    "this coincident statistic is then used to calculate a combined false alarm rate , the final detection statistic of the search .",
    "we determine the coincident statistic @xmath33 for three different types of coincidences : gravitational - wave search candidates , simulated waveform injection coincidences , and time - shifted coincidences .",
    "we then determine a false alarm rate ( far ) for each type of coincidence by counting the number of time - shifted coincidences found in the analysis time @xmath34 for each of the coincident search networks given in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "for each of the different types of coincidences in each of the search networks , we determine the far with the expression : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the measured number of coincidences with @xmath37 in the @xmath38 shifted analysis for a total of 100 time - shifted analyses .",
    "we then rank coincidences by their fars across all search networks into a combined ranking , known as combined far  @xcite .",
    "this is the final detection statistic used in these investigations .",
    "in order to compute the far for any candidate , we use the rfbdt algorithm to assign a probability that any candidate is a gravitational - wave signal .",
    "this random forest technology is a well - developed improvement over the classical decision tree .",
    "each event is characterized by a feature vector , containing parameters thought to be useful for distinguishing signal from background .",
    "a decision tree consists of a series of binary splits on these feature vector parameters .",
    "a single decision tree is a weak classifier , as it is susceptible to false minima and over - training  @xcite and generally performs worse than neural networks  @xcite .",
    "random forest technology combats these issues and is considered more stable in the presence of outliers and in very high dimensional parameter spaces than other machine learning algorithms  @xcite .",
    "we use the ( ) software package developed for high energy physics data analysis .",
    "this analysis uses the random forest of bootstrap aggregated ( bagged ) decision trees algorithm .",
    "the method of bootstrap aggregation or `` bagging '' as described below , tends to perform better in high noise situations than other random forest methods such as boosting  @xcite .",
    "a random forest of bagged decision trees uses a collection of many decision trees that are built from a set of training data .",
    "the training data is composed of the feature vectors of events that we know _ a priori _ to belong to either the set of signals or background ( i.e. , coincidences associated with simulated injections and coincidences associated with time - shifted data ) . then the decision trees are used to assign a probability that an event that we wish to classify belongs to the class of signal or background .",
    "a cartoon diagram is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : forest ] .    to construct a decision tree",
    ", we make a series of one - dimensional splits on a random subset of parameters from the feature vector .",
    "each split determines a branching point , or node .",
    "individual splits are chosen to best separate signal and background given the available parameters .",
    "there are several methods to determine the optimal parameter threshold at each node .",
    "we measure the goodness of a threshold split based on receiver operating characteristic curves ( as described in section  [ sec : roc ] ) .",
    "the software package  @xcite provides several options for optimization criterion .",
    "we found that the gini index  @xcite and the negative cross - entropy provided comparable , suitable performance for both searches .",
    "thus we arbitrarily chose the gini index for the imr search and the negative cross - entropy for the ringdown - only search .",
    "additional discussion is given in sect .",
    "[ sec : criterion ] .",
    "the gini index is defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fraction of events in a node that are signals and @xmath41 is the fraction of events in the node that are background .",
    "splits are made only if they will minimize the gini index .",
    "the negative cross - entropy function is defined by @xmath42 as @xmath43 is symmetric against the exchange of @xmath40 and @xmath44 , if a node contains as many signal events as background , then @xmath45 .",
    "a perfectly sorted node has @xmath46 . by minimizing the negative cross - entropy of our nodes",
    ", we find the optimal sort .    when no split on a node can reduce the entropy or it contains fewer events than a preset limit , it is no longer divided .",
    "at this point , the node becomes a `` leaf '' .",
    "the number of events in the preset limit is known as the `` minimum leaf size '' . when all nodes have become leaves ,",
    "we have created a decision tree .",
    "this process is repeated to create each decision tree in the forest .",
    "each individual tree is trained on a bootstrap replica , or a resampled set of the original training set , so that each tree will have a different set of training events .",
    "furthermore , a different randomly - chosen subset of feature vector parameters is chosen at each node to attempt the next split .",
    "thus each decision tree in the forest is unique .",
    "results from each tree can be averaged to reduce the variance in the statistical classification .",
    "this is the method of bootstrap aggregation or `` bagging '' .",
    "the forest can then be used to classify an event of unknown class .",
    "the event is placed in the initial node of each tree and is passed along the various trees branches until it arrives at a leaf on each tree . to compute the ranking statistic for an event from a forest of decision trees ,",
    "we find its final leaf in all trees .",
    "the probability that an event is a signal is given by the fraction of signal events in all leaves , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the number of signal and background events in the @xmath50th leaf and @xmath51 is the total number of signal and background events in all final leaves .",
    "the final ranking statistic , @xmath52 , for a forest of decision trees is given by the ratio of the probability that the event is a signal to the probability that the event is background , @xmath53 this ranking statistic is a probability ratio , indicating how much the signal model is favored over the background model .    in order to test the performance of the random forest ,",
    "we determine how well it sorts events that we know _ a priori _ are signal or background .",
    "rather than generate a new training set of simulated injections and time - shifted data , we may sort the training set used in construction of the forest . to prevent over - estimation of classifier performance ,",
    "decision trees can not be used to classify the same events on which they were trained .",
    "thus we use a round - robin approach to iteratively classify events using a random forest trained on a set excluding those events .",
    "we construct ten random forests each using 90% of the training events such that the remaining 10% of events may be safely classified . in this way",
    "we can efficiently verify the performance of the random forest using only the original training events .",
    "each forest is trained on and used to evaluate a particular type of double coincidence from the detector network ( i.e. , h1l1 , h1v1 , l1v1 ) , as each pair of detectors produces unique statistics .",
    "triple coincidences are split into their respective doubles , as there is not sufficient triple - coincident background to train a separate forest . for a triple coincidence with triggers from detectors @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56",
    ", the ranking statistic @xmath57 will be the product of @xmath58 for each pair of triggers , @xmath59 where @xmath60 \\{@xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 } denotes the possible pairs of double coincident triggers in a triple coincidence .    .",
    "there are several issues to consider when optimizing the performance of rfbdt classifiers .",
    "performance of the algorithm is dependent on the quality of the training set ( i.e. , how well the training data represent the actual population we wish to detect ) . additionally , we must select appropriate statistics to include in the feature vector of each coincidence . finally , rfbdt classifiers have several parameters that must be tuned to optimize the sorting performance . these include number of trees , number of sampled parameters from the feature vector at each node , and minimum leaf size .",
    "improperly choosing these meta parameters will lead to a poorly trained classifier .",
    "in general there are two types of mistrained classifiers .",
    "an over - trained classifier separates the training data well , but the sort is specific to those data .",
    "an over - trained classifier may provide very high or very low @xmath52 , but these values contain a large systematic bias .",
    "any events that were not well represented by this training set will be misclassified . an under - trained classifier has not gleaned enough information from the training data to sort properly . in this case",
    "the classifier is unsure of which set any event belongs , assigning intermediate values of @xmath52 to all .",

    "these investigations were performed over data collected by ligo and virgo between 2009 and 2010 so that comparisons can be made with previous imr and ringdown - only search results  @xcite .",
    "we discuss several issues related to tuning rfbdt multivariate classifiers in matched - filter imr and ringdown - only searches .",
    "we determine the sensitivity improvements achieved through the use of a rfbdt - derived ranking statistic over empirical snr - based ranking statistics while considering the application of data quality vetoes .",
    "additionally , we present results for several modifications on the basic rfbdt implementation including the use of an expansive training set and data quality information .",
    "when optimizing the performance of rfbdt classifiers , we found that a rfbdt classifier with 100 trees , a leaf size of 5 , and 6 randomly sampled parameters from the feature vector gave good performance for the imr search while a rfbdt classifier with 2000 trees , a leaf size of 65 , and 14 randomly sampled parameters from the feature vector gave good performance for the ringdown - only search . in both cases , we used a training set of  clean `` signal designed to carefully remove contamination from glitches within the software injection - finding time window .",
    "this technique eliminated the excursion of gravitational - wave candidate coincidences from the @xmath64 region of the expected background at low values of inverse combined far as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ifarbump ] .",
    "additionally , we examined the performance of the rfbdt classifier in the case where the monthly analyses used background training sets from their respective months and in the case where the monthly analyses used background training sets from the entire period 2 analysis ( i.e. , the ' ' full background set \" ) .",
    "we found that using the full background training set does not result in a clear sensitivity improvement unless a data quality _ hveto _ parameter is introduced in the feature vector .",
    "for the imr search , we performed a re - analysis replacing @xmath65 with the ranking statistic calculated by the rfbdt , @xmath52 .",
    "comparisons with @xmath65 were made separately at each veto level .",

    "we found that @xmath52 at veto level 2 shows greater improvement and hence a more stringent upper limit than @xmath52 at veto level  3 .",

    "additionally , we found that adding an _ hveto _ parameter at veto level  2 does not result in the same increase in sensitivity obtained by applying level 3 vetoes to a search using the basic implementation of the rfbdt classifier . with more sophisticated methods for adding data quality information to the feature vector",
    ", we may see additional improvements or different behavior .",
    "further exploration is needed .    in general",
    ", for each search , we found that the rfbdt multivariate classifier results in a considerably more sensitive search than the empirical snr - based statistic at both veto levels .",
    "the software for constructing clean injection sets and the rfbdts is now implemented in the lalsuite gravitational - wave data analysis routines for use with other matched - filter searches .",
    "more investigations will be needed to understand whether lower mass searches for gravitational waves from binary coalescence would benefit from the use of multivariate classification with supervised mlas . for higher mass searches , particularly those susceptible to contamination from noise transients ,",
    "rfbdt multivariate classifiers have proven to be a valuable tool for improving search sensitivity .    *",

    "single trigger statistics added to the feature vector included the matched - filter snr from each detector  @xcite , the @xmath27 signal - consistency test for the matched - filter result in a number of frequency bins for each detector  @xcite , the @xmath75 veto duration for which a weighted @xmath27 exceeds a pre - set threshold , and the @xmath76 quantity for the residual of the snr and autocorrelation time series in each detector .",
    "more details on the matched - filter snr for the imr search templates are given in  @xcite and a definition is given in table  [ tab : paramshm ] .",
    "the @xmath27 signal - consistency test , only currently calculated for the low and high mass searches , tests how well the template waveform matches the data in various frequency bands .",

    "this quantity is motivated by the fact that a signal is unlikely to exactly match a template so a non - centrality parameter is introduced to the distribution of the @xmath27 signal - consistency test .",
    "thus , rather than thresholding on @xmath27 , we threshold on @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath76 calculation performs a sum of squares of the residual of the snr time series and the autocorrelation time series of a single detector trigger .",
    "composite statistics are defined by combining single trigger statistics in a meaningful way and are computed once for each coincidence .",
    "although the classifier can approximate such statistics in the multidimensional parameter space ( e.g. , if they are a combination of the @xmath82 and @xmath27 ) , this ability is limited by the tree depth , the number of decision tree cuts before hitting the minimum leaf size . thus ,",
    "if we have _ a priori _ knowledge of a useful functional form for a ranking statistic , we should provide the classifier with this information . by providing this information up front",
    ", a classifier can improve upon these good statistics rather than trying to construct them itself .",
    "some of these composite statistics have previously been used as ranking statistics when calculating combined fars in searches . for the imr search , we include several previous ranking statistics in the feature vector .",
    "the first of these is known as the effective snr statistic and was used as a ranking statistic in  @xcite , @xmath83^{1/4}}.\\ ] ] the second is known as @xmath65 , a @xmath27-weighted statistic described in detail in  @xcite for the imr search . due to the different distributions of background",

    "these include the difference in arrival time d@xmath89 , the relative difference in chirp mass d@xmath90 , the relative difference in the symmetric mass ratio d@xmath91 , and a quantity known as the _ e - thinca _ test that combines these three by constructing error ellipsoids in time and mass space  @xcite .",

    "the combined network snr for the @xmath51 detectors participating in the coincidence , @xmath98 where @xmath78 is the snr in the @xmath50th detector , is the optimal ranking statistic for a signal with known parameters in gaussian noise .    in the ringdown - only search in  @xcite , due to the dearth of false alarms found in triple coincidence , a suitable statistic for ranking triple coincident events",

    "we include this piece - wise detection statistic composed of @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the feature vector .    for the most recent ringdown - only search  @xcite , due to a large increase in analysis time and lower snr thresholds ,",

    "the hveto algorithm identifies auxiliary channels that exhibit a significant correlation with transient noise present in the gravitational - wave channel and that have a negligible sensitivity to gravitational - waves . if a trigger in the gravitational - wave channel is found to have a statistical relationship with auxiliary channel glitches , a flagged time interval is defined .",
    "the second additional parameter was a count of the number of single detector triggers clustered over a time interval of @xmath116ms using a snr peak - finding algorithm described in  @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind this parameter comes from investigations that show that a glitch will be recovered with a different pattern of templates over time than a signal  @xcite .",
    "ideally , a @xmath27-based statistic could be computed . however , in the absence of this test for the ringdown - only search , we simply provide a count of the number of templates in a small time window around each trigger giving a matched - filter snr above the threshold ."
