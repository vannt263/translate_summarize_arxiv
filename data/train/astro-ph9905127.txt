    "ganga et al . ( 1997a , hereafter grgs ) developed a technique to account for uncertainties , such as those in the beamwidth and the calibration , in likelihood analyses of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data .",

    "a combined analysis of all these data sets is presented in ratra et al .",

    "in this paper we present a similar analysis of cmb anisotropy data from the python i , ii , and iii observations performed at the south pole ( dragovan et al .",
    "1994 , hereafter d94 ; ruhl et al . 1995b , hereafter r95 ; platt et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter p97 ) .",
    "the python detectors and telescope are described by ruhl ( 1993 ) and d94 ; also see ruhl et al .",
    "( 1995a ) and alvarez ( 1996 ) . in what follows we review the information needed for our analysis .",
    "python i , ii , and iii cmb data were taken in a frequency band centered at 90 ghz with four bolometric detectors centered at the corners of a @xmath7 by @xmath7 square on the sky .",
    "the beam profiles are well - approximated by a gaussian of fwhm @xmath8 ( one standard deviation uncertainty ) .",
    "observations were centered at @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "python i and ii data were taken at a single telescope elevation .",
    "python iii data were taken at this fiducial elevation as well as two additional elevations offset @xmath11 on the sky above and below the fiducial elevation .",
    "the reduced python data are shown in figure 1 .",
    "all of the python measurements were made by switching the four beams horizontally across the sky in a three - point pattern by rotating a vertical flat mirror at 2.5 hz .",
    "this chopping pattern was then combined with slow ( typically 0.1 hz ) azimuthal beam switching of the entire telescope to produce a four - beam response to a sky signal .",
    "the chopper throw and azimuthal telescope beam switching were both @xmath7 on the sky for the python i and ii observations .",
    "( hereafter i ) resulted in 16 data points , 8 each from the lower and upper rows of detectors ( d94 ) .",
    "python ii observed two sets of points on the sky ( r95 ) , although one of the detectors did not work during this season .",
    "the first set of observations , hereafter iia , overlapped the i points and yielded 7 measurements from the lower row of detectors and 8 from the upper row .",
    "the second set , hereafter iib , measured the same number of points on the sky as the first set , but these were offset in azimuth relative to the i points by @xmath12 on the sky .",
    "two series of measurements were made at each of the three elevations observed during the python iii season ( p97 ) .",
    "for each series , the physical throw of the chopper was the same at all elevations .",
    "because the actual throw on the sky depends on elevation , the python iii beam was smeared to a gaussian fwhm of @xmath13 ( one standard deviation uncertainty ) when forming the four - beam pattern to account for the imperfect overlap of the beams caused by this effect .",
    "this procedure also accounted for the relative pointing uncertainty and fluctuations in the chopper throw .",
    "the first series of python iii measurements , hereafter iiil , used the same chopper and beam switch parameters as python i and ii .",
    "the iiil data consists of two sets of points taken at the i elevation but offset in right ascension by @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the sky .",
    "two sets of measurements were also made at each of the lower and upper elevations , but these were offset in right ascension by @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the sky relative to i.    the second series of python iii measurements , hereafter iiis , were made with both the chopper throw and telescope beam switch reduced to @xmath11 .",
    "for each of the three telescope elevations , the iiis data consists of points separated horizontally by @xmath11 on the sky for each of the 2 rows of detectors .",
    "figure 1 shows the points observed by iiil and iiis at each elevation .",
    "together , i , ii , and iii densely sample a @xmath18 by @xmath19 region of the sky .",
    "the 1 @xmath6 absolute calibration uncertainty in the python data is @xmath20 ( d94 ; r95 ; p97 ) and is accounted for in our analysis .",
    "the absolute pointing uncertainty is @xmath21 ( d94 ; r95 ) and is not accounted for in our analysis .",
    "in @xmath222 we summarize the computational techniques used in our analysis .",

    "conclusions are given in @xmath224 .",
    "the zero - lag window function for the python observations are shown in figure 2 and the zero - lag window function parameters are in table 1 .",
    "in this paper we focus on a spatially open cdm model and a spatially flat cdm model with a cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "these low density models are largely consistent with current observational constraints . for recent discussions see park et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , retzlaff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , croft et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and peebles ( 1999 ) .",
    "the models have gaussian , adiabatic primordial energy - density power spectra .",
    "the flat-@xmath0 model cmb anisotropy computations use a scale - invariant energy - density perturbation power spectrum ( harrison 1970 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) , as predicted in the simplest spatially - flat inflation models ( guth 1981 ; kazanas 1980 ; sato 1981 ) .",
    "the open model computations use the energy - density power spectrum ( ratra & peebles 1994 , 1995 ; bucher , goldhaber , & turok 1995 ; yamamoto , sasaki , & tanaka 1995 ) predicted in the simplest open - bubble inflation models ( gott 1982 ) .",
    "the computation of the cmb anisotropy spectra is described by stompor ( 1994 ) and sugiyama ( 1995 ) .",
    "as discussed in r99a , the spectra are parameterized by their quadrupole - moment amplitude @xmath23 , the nonrelativistic - mass density parameter @xmath1 , the baryonic - mass density parameter @xmath2 , and the age of the universe @xmath4 .",
    "the spectra are computed for a range of @xmath1 spanning the interval 0.1 to 1 in steps of 0.1 , for a range of @xmath24 [ the hubble parameter @xmath25 spanning the interval 0.005 to 0.029 in steps of 0.004 , and for a range of @xmath4 spanning the interval 10 to 20 gyr in steps of 2 gyr . in total 798 spectra",
    "were computed to cover the cosmological - parameter spaces of the open and flat-@xmath0 models .",
    "figure 2 shows examples of the cmb anisotropy spectra used in our analysis .",
    "other examples are in figure 2 of r99a and figure 1 of r99b .",
    "while it is of interest to also consider other cosmological parameters , such as tilt or gravity wave fraction or a time - variable cosmological  constant \" ( instead of a constant @xmath0 ) , to make the problem tractable we have focussed on the four parameters mentioned above .",
    "we emphasize however that the results of the analysis are model dependent .",
    "for instance , a time - variable @xmath0 model would likely lead to a different constraint on @xmath1 than that derived below in the constant @xmath0 model .",
    "following grgs , for each of the 798 spectra considered the ",
    "bare \" likelihood function is computed at the nominal beamwidth and calibration , as well as at a number of other values of the beamwidth and calibration determined from the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the likelihood function used in the derivation of the central values and limits is determined by integrating ( marginalizing ) the bare likelihood function over the beamwidth and calibration uncertainties with weights determined by the measured probability distribution functions of the beamwidth and the calibration .",
    "see grgs for a more detailed discussion . when marginalizing over the beamwidth uncertainty we have checked in a few selected cases that the five - point gauss - hermite quadrature summation approximation to the integral agrees extremely well with the three - point gauss - hermite approximation used by grgs ( and for most of the analysis in this paper ) .",
    "the likelihoods are a function of four parameters mentioned above : @xmath23 , @xmath1 , @xmath24 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we also compute marginalized likelihood functions by integrating over one or more of these parameters after assuming a uniform prior in the relevant parameters .",
    "the prior is set to zero outside the ranges considered for the parameters .",
    "grgs and r99a describe the prescription used to determine central values and limits from the likelihood functions . in what follows we consider 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath6 highest posterior density limits which include 68.3 , 95.4 , and 99.7% of the area .",
    "table 2 lists the derived values of @xmath23 and bandtemperature @xmath26 for the flat bandpower spectrum , for various combinations of the i , ii , and iii data .",
    "these numerical values account for the beamwidth and calibration uncertainties .",
    "the last two @xmath26 entries in table 2 are quite consistent with those derived by p97 ; the small differences reflect the different methods used to account for beamwidth and calibration uncertainties here and in p97 .    for the flat bandpower spectrum the combined i , ii , and iii data average 1 @xmath6 @xmath26 error bar is @xmath27 @xmath26 error bar is @xmath28 ( depending on model , grski et al .",
    "1998 ) . ] : python data results in a very significant detection of cmb anisotropy , even after accounting for beamwidth and calibration uncertainties .",
    "note that the calibration uncertainty , @xmath20 , is the most important contributor to this error bar .",
    "a number of other interesting conclusions follow from the entries in table 2 . comparing the i+ii and iiil results , which are from experiments which probe almost identical angular scales",
    ", we see that the iiil amplitude is @xmath29 @xmath6 higher than the i+ii amplitude . comparing the result from the analysis of the coadded i and iia data ( which are from experiments with identical window functions ) and the result from the full analysis of the i and iia data ( which takes into account all the spatial correlations ) , we see that the deduced amplitudes are almost identical .",
    "this is probably mostly a reflection of the fact that the individual i and iia amplitudes are almost identical ( see table 2 ) .",
    "as discussed in r99a and r99b , the four - dimensional posterior probability density distribution function @xmath30 is nicely peaked in the @xmath23 direction but fairly flat in the other three directions .",
    "marginalizing over @xmath23 results in a three - dimensional posterior distribution @xmath31 which is steeper , but still relatively flat . as a consequence ,",
    "limits derived from the four- and three - dimensional posterior distributions are generally not highly statistically significant .",
    "we therefore do not show contour plots of these functions here .",
    "marginalizing over @xmath23 and one other parameter results in two - dimensional posterior probability distributions which are more peaked .",
    "see figures 3 and 4 . as in the argo ( r99a ) and",
    "combination ( r99b ) data set analyses , in some cases these peaks are at an edge of the parameter range considered .",
    "figure 3 shows that the two - dimensional posterior distributions allow one to distinguish between different regions of parameter space at a fairly high formal level of confidence .",
    "for instance , the open model near @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 gyr , and the flat-@xmath0 model near @xmath35 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 gyr , are both formally ruled out at @xmath36 @xmath6 confidence .",
    "however , we emphasize , as discussed in r99a and r99b , care must be exercised when interpreting the discriminative power of these formal limits , since they depend sensitively on the fact that the uniform prior has been set to zero outside the range of the parameter space we have considered .",
    "figure 4 shows the contours of the two - dimensional posterior distribution for @xmath23 and @xmath1 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional distribution over @xmath24 and @xmath4 .",
    "these are shown for the combined python i , ii , and iii data , the dmr data , and three combinations of data from the sp94 , argo , max 4 + 5 , white dish , and suzie experiments ( r99b ) , for both the open and flat-@xmath0 models . constraints on these parameters from the combined python data are consistent with those from the dmr data for the flat-@xmath0 models , panel @xmath37 , while for the open model , panel @xmath38 , consistency at 2 @xmath6 ( 1 @xmath6 ) requires @xmath39 0.2 ( 0.35 ) .",
    "the combined python data amplitudes are a little higher than those derived from the other small - scale data combinations , panels @xmath40 , but at 2 @xmath6 confidence the various amplitudes are mostly consistent .",
    "figure 5 shows the one - dimensional posterior distribution functions for @xmath1 , @xmath24 , @xmath4 , and @xmath23 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional posterior distribution over the other three parameters . from these one - dimensional distributions , the combined i , ii , and iii data favors an open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model with @xmath1 = 0.19 ( 0.10 ) , or @xmath24 = 0.005 ( 0.005 ) , or @xmath4 = 10 ( 13 ) gyr , amongst the models considered . at 2 @xmath6 confidence the combined python data formally rule out only small regions of parameter space . from the one - dimensional distributions of figure 5 ,",
    "the data requires @xmath1 @xmath41 or @xmath42 ( @xmath1 @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) , or @xmath24 @xmath45 ( @xmath24 @xmath45 ) , or @xmath4 @xmath46 gyr ( @xmath4 @xmath46 gyr ) for the open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model at 2 @xmath6 . as discussed in r99a and r99b ,",
    "care is needed when interpreting the discriminative power of these formal limits .",
    "these papers also discuss a more conservative gaussian posterior distribution limit prescription . using this more conservative prescription",
    ", we find only an upper 1 @xmath6 limit on @xmath47 in the open model .",
    "while the statistical significance of the constraints on cosmological parameters is not high , it is reassuring that the combined python data favor low - density , low @xmath24 , young models , consistent with some of the indications from the combinations of cmb anisotropy data considered by r99b , and the indications from most recent non - cmb observations ( see discussion in r99b ) .",
    "the peak values of the one - dimensional posterior distributions shown in figure 5 are listed in the figure caption for the case when the four - dimensional posterior distributions are normalized such that @xmath48 . with this normalization , marginalizing over the remaining parameter the fully marginalized posterior distributions are @xmath49 for the open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model and the combined python data .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the indication from panels @xmath37 and @xmath38 of figure 5 that the most - favored open model is somewhat more favored than the most - favored flat-@xmath0 one .",
    "the combined python i , ii , and iii data results derived here are mostly consistent with those derived from the dmr , sp94 , argo , max 4 + 5 , white dish and suzie data .",
    "the combined python data significantly constrains @xmath50 ( for the flat bandpower spectrum @xmath51k at 1 @xmath6 ) and weakly favors low - density , low @xmath24 , young models .",
