    "if we have to go beyond the standard model ( sm ) , for which there are ample motivations , the most popular choice seems to be supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite . with a plethora of new degrees of freedom ,",
    "it is necessary to constrain them , in addition to direct searches at the colliders , in as many ways as possible so that the parameter space for the susy particles may be narrowed down .",
    "one of the most useful ways to put such constraints is to consider the dangerous directions of the scalar potential where the potential may be unbounded from below ( ufb ) or develops a charge and/or color breaking ( ccb ) minima @xcite .",
    "this may happen since one now has charged and colored scalar fields in the spectrum , and the possible existence of such a direction would make the standard vacuum unstable .",
    "different directions are chosen by giving vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to one or more scalar fields , while keeping the vevs of the other scalars to zero .",
    "such constraints , in fact , are very powerful .",
    "this may be realized from the fact that the allowed parameter space ( aps ) for susy models is practically unrestricted as one goes for larger and larger values of the soft susy breaking parameters ( _ e.g. _ , the universal scalar and gaugino masses , the trilinear coupling , etc . ) beyond the kinematic limit of the current high energy colliders . on the otherhand",
    "the ufb and ccb constraints quite often acquire greater eliminating power to rule out significant parts of such regions beyond the striking range of the current experiments .",
    "thus , there is an intricate balance between such ` potential constraints ' and the expanding susy aps .",
    "for some values of the free parameters , the ufb and ccb conditions are very sharp and disallow most of the parameter space that is otherwise allowed ; for some other values , they lose their constraining power .    in a very interesting paper which revived interest in ufb and ccb constraints , casas _",
    "et al _ @xcite investigated such constraints on susy models .",
    "though their formulae are fairly model - independent , they have carried out the numerical analysis for moderate values of @xmath5 ( the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the two higgs fields ) only , when one can ignore the effects of b and @xmath6 yukawa couplings in the relevant renormalization group equations ( rge s ) .",
    "further they have used the standard minimal supergravity ( msugra ) assumption of universal soft scalar mass @xmath7 and universal gaugino mass @xmath8 at the gut scale @xmath9 , referred to hereafter as the ` conventional scenario ' , to determine the sparticle spectrum .",
    "their main result was that within the framework of msugra , a certain ufb constraint known as ufb-3 with vev given in the direction of the slepton field puts the tightest bound on the susy parameter space that they considered ( see eq .",
    "( 93 ) of @xcite and the discussions that follows ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend and complement the work of @xcite by analyzing the effectiveness of the ufb constraints for large @xmath5 , this we have done in two models : ( i ) the conventional scenario and ( ii ) a modified version of msugra within the frame of a so(10 ) gut where the sfermion soft masses @xmath10 are universal at the gut scale , but the higgs soft masses @xmath11 are diferent from them ( this we will call the ` nonuniversal scenario ' ) . in course of this work we have realized that in contrast to the low @xmath5 scenario , the ufb-3 constraint with squarks ( eq .  31 of @xcite ) may become stronger under certain circumstances , and over a large part of the parameter space the constraint known as ufb-1 ( see eq .",
    "( [ ufbone ] ) ) serves as the chief restrictor of the aps .",
    "it is well known that there are quite a few motivations for going beyond small and intermediate values of @xmath5 in the context of grand unified theories ( gut ) .",
    "if one assumes the gut group so(10 ) breaking directly to the sm gauge group su(3)@xmath12su(2)@xmath12u(1 ) , and a minimal higgs field content ( only one * 10 * containing both the light higgs doublets required in mssm ) , the top , bottom and @xmath6 yukawa couplings must unify to a definite gut scale value at the scale where so(10 ) breaks @xcite . within the framework of guts",
    "partial @xmath0 yukawa unification is also an attractive possibility @xcite . in an so(10 )",
    "model , even if one assumes more than one * 10 * -plet of higgs fields , @xmath6 and bottom yukawa couplings must unify , but the top yukawa may not unify with them at the gut scale @xmath9",
    ".    it can be shown that @xmath5 must lie in the range 45 - 52 for @xmath1 yukawa unification ( for @xmath13 gev ) and in the range 30 - 50 for only @xmath0 unification .",
    "we do not consider the possibility @xmath14 since such low values of @xmath5 are now under pressure due to the lower bound on the lightest higgs boson mass from lep @xcite .",
    "this justifies the enthusiasm that has been generated regarding the phenomenology of large @xmath5 scenario @xcite .    to motivate the nonuniversal scenario under consideration ,",
    "let us note that from a sugra point of view , it is natural to choose the scale at which susy breaks in the vicinity of the planck scale @xmath15 gev . at this scale ,",
    "one may have truly universal soft masses for all scalars ; however , the running of the scalar masses between @xmath16 and @xmath9 can lead to a nondegeneracy at @xmath9 @xcite . within the framework of an so(10 ) gut",
    ", the first two sfermion generations will still be degenerate , as they live in the same representation of so(10 ) and have negligible yukawa couplings .",
    "the higgs fields live in a different representation , and couple to other heavy gut fields to generate the doublet - triplet splitting ; so their masses can change significantly .",
    "the third generation sfermions may have a large yukawa coupling and hence may be nondegenerate from the first two generation of sfermions , though this effect has not been taken into account in our discussion for simplicity .",
    "only the higgs mass parameter ( @xmath11 ) at @xmath9 is assumed to be different from the common soft sfermion mass ( @xmath10 ) at that scale , and both are treated as free parameters .",
    "in addition to restricting the values of @xmath5 , the requirement of yukawa unification eliminates a significant region of the otherwise large aps of mssm quite effectively .",
    "for example , this unification occurs within a rather limited region of the @xmath17 plane for certain generic choices of the common trilinear soft breaking parameter @xmath18 .",
    "this dependence arises largely through the radiative corrections to the running bottom quark mass @xcite which in turn controls the bottom quark yukawa coupling @xmath19 at low energies .",
    "the ufb-1 and the ufb-3 conditions further eliminate a significant region from this already restricted aps , which is one of the main results of this paper . throughout the paper",
    "we ignore the possibility that the nonrenormalizable effective operators may stabilise the potential @xcite .",
    "the aps obtained by requiring yukawa unification only is quite sensitive on the choice of @xmath18 . for example , in the conventional scenario with @xmath0 unification , the aps increases quite a bit for large negative values of @xmath18 .",
    "it is precisely these values of @xmath18 which makes the potential more vulnerable to the ufb conditions and many of the additional points allowed by choosing @xmath18 appropriately are eliminated by the ufb conditions , as will be demonstrated in a later section .",
    "thus , there is a nice complementary behaviour : for large negative @xmath18 , the yukawa unification criterion is a weak condition but ufb conditions are very strong , while for small negative values of @xmath18 the roles are reversed",
    ". for positive @xmath18 , none of these criteria are sufficiently strong .",
    "following the same procedure , significant regions of the parameter space can be eliminated for models with @xmath1 yukawa unification . in particular , we find that @xmath20 is completely ruled out .    the effectiveness of yukawa unification as a restrictor of the aps also diminishes , as expected , as the accuracy with which we require the unification to hold good is relaxed .",
    "there are several reasons why the unification may not be exact .",
    "first , there may be threshold corrections @xcite , both at the susy breaking scale ( due to nondegeneracy of the sparticles ) and at @xmath9 , of which no exact estimates exist .",
    "secondly , we have used two - loop rge s for gauge couplings as well as yukawa couplings and one loop rges for the soft breaking parameters , but higher order loop corrections may be important at a few percent level at higher energy scales .",
    "finally the success of the unification program is also dependent on the choice of @xmath21 which is not known as precisely as @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "to circumvent such drawbacks , one relaxes the yukawa unification condition to a finite amount ( 5% , 10% or 20% ) which should indirectly take care of these possible caveats .",
    "it is interesing to note that quite often the ufb constraints rule out subtantial parts of the extended aps .",
    "some of the `` potential '' constraints analyzed here were also discussed by rattazzi and sarid @xcite .",
    "however , they considered the rg improved tree - level potentials only and included the possibility of stabilizing the potential through nonrenormalizable effective operators .",
    "moreover the potent ufb-3 constraint was not available at the time of their analysis .",
    "finally a systematic analysis of the aps in the @xmath24-@xmath25 plane , which is very relevant for physics studies at the large hadronic collider ( lhc ) , was not presented .",
    "when the so(10 ) symmetry breaks down to the sm symmetry , there may be a nonzero d - term , which causes the mass splitting between sfermions in * 5 * and @xmath26 of so(10 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of authors addressed to the phenomenology of the so(10 ) d - terms @xcite . in this paper , we take the d - term to be zero for simplicity ; with a nonzero d - term , one gets a wider variety if constraints which will be discussed in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that there is a basic conflict between @xmath27 and @xmath1 yukawa unification .",
    "the latter works best for @xmath28 and large @xmath5 , while at the same time this region of the parameter space tends to give unacceptable contributions to the former @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the uncertainties in the long - distance corrections and the possibility of cancellation between various diagrams , we have not included this constraint in our analysis .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we outline the various ufb directions of the supersymmetric potential , and discuss our methodolgy .",
    "the next section deals with the results and in the last section , we summarize and conclude .",
    "in this section we briefly review the necessary formulae for the ufb directions following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we closely follow the former reference in defining the said directions .",
    "the scalar potential of the mssm is a function of several scalar fields .",
    "an su(2)@xmath12u(1 ) breaking minimum of this potential must exist for preserving the phenomenological successes of the sm . moreover , one demands this real minimum @xmath29 to be deeper than the unwanted ufb and ccb minima .",
    "these minima are computed by giving vev to one or more scalar components at a time ; the condition is that at no point in such dangerous directions the potential should be deeper than @xmath29 .",
    "the resulting constraints on the field space are of much importance as they can restrict the soft susy breaking parameters , and hence the sparticle masses and couplings @xcite .",
    "let us see how these dangerous field directions arise .",
    "the tree level scalar potential in the mssm can be written as the sum of the d - term , the f - term and the soft mass term : v_0=v_f+v_d+v_soft where v_f&= & _ | |^2 , + v_d&= & _ ag_a^2 ( _ t^a ) ^2 , + v_soft&=&_m__^2 | _ |^2 + _ i \\ { a_u_i_u_iq_i h_2u_i+a_d_i _ d_iq_ih_1d_i+a_e_i_eil_ih_1e_i+h.c . }",

    "( [ superpot ] ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 stand for su(2 ) doublet squark and slepton superfields while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the corresponding singlet superfields .",
    "the generation index @xmath43 runs from 1 to 3 .",
    "the neutral part of the higgs potential in the mssm is given by v_higgs = m_1",
    "^ 2| h_1 ^ 2| + m_2 ^ 2|h_2 ^ 2 |-2 | m_3 ^ 2|| h_1| | h_2| + ( g^2+g_2 ^ 2)(|h_2|^2-|h_1|^2)^2 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the mass terms of the two doublets .",
    "the standard gut normalization is used for the gauge couplings : @xmath49 at @xmath9 .",
    "minimization of this tree - level potential yields v_realmin=- . at any scale @xmath50",
    ", there is a significant radiative correction to this potential . including the one - loop corrections , the potential becomes v = v_0+v_1 where v_1= _ m_^4 , [ oneloop ] with @xmath51 , @xmath52 being the spin of the corresponding field .",
    "one ensures the minima of @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "as was pointed out , the constraints on the aps arise from directions in the field space along which the potential becomes lower than @xmath29 ( and may become unbounded from below ) .",
    "however , the minimization of the full potential @xmath58 is rather cumbersome . on the otherhand ,",
    "just minimizing the tree - level potential at the weak scale neglecting @xmath59 can lead to quite erroneous conclusions about the minimum point in the field space as was shown by @xcite . as a compromise ,",
    "one evaluates @xmath58 at a judiciously chosen scale @xmath60 where the one - loop correction is minimum . as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ oneloop ] ) , this scale should be about the typical susy mass scale @xmath61 so that the large logarithmic terms tend to vanish .",
    "the dangerous directions are selected in such a way that the positive definite f - terms vanish and the d - terms either cancel each other or their magnitudes can be kept under control .",
    "there are several other guidelines as discussed in @xcite .",
    "using these conditions one can get the following ufb potentials .    * ufb-1",
    "* : the condition + 2 , [ ufbone ] which is known as ufb-1 , must be satisfied at any scale @xmath62 , and particularly at the unification scale @xmath63 , to have a realistic minimum of the scalar potential .",
    "( [ ufbone ] ) , small @xmath64 ( and @xmath65 ) makes the ufb-1 condition severely restrictive .",
    "this may be the case for large @xmath5 and large negative values of @xmath18 .",
    "the variations of @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the conventional scenario with respect to the common trilinear coupling @xmath18 for @xmath68 and 45 , corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath1 yukawa unification respectively , are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . from the figure we find that negative values of @xmath18 drive @xmath67 to large negative values in both the cases . for @xmath64",
    "the effect is prominent for large @xmath5 , while for @xmath68 , @xmath64 remains positive for most of the range of @xmath18 that we have studied .",
    "the plot of @xmath69 vs @xmath18 is also given for different values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 for @xmath70 in figures 2 and 3 respectively . from these plots",
    "it is clear that for large @xmath8 and/or @xmath10 , and large negative @xmath18 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 decrease significantly , so that these values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 become vulnerable to ufb-1 .",
    "this is the reason why in the large @xmath5 case the ufb-1 constraint plays a very significant role in restricting the aps .    * ufb-2 * : the doublet slepton ( along the sneutrino direction ) and both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given nonzero vevs . for any value of @xmath71 satisfying | h_2 |^2 > , and provided that v_realmin(q = m_s ) where @xmath72 .",
    "however , we find that ufb-2 hardly rules out any further region of the aps which passes the ufb-1 and ufb-3 constraints , so it is of limited interest to us .    * ufb-3 * : the convention is to choose @xmath73 and to cancel the @xmath53 f - term ( which is a combination of @xmath54 and @xmath74 or @xmath75 ) with suitable vevs to @xmath54 and the abovementioned slepton or squark directions .",
    "however , it is economical to give vevs to the doublet fields ( along @xmath76 direction ) rather than the singlet fields to cancel both su(2 ) and u(1 ) d - terms at the same stroke .",
    "suppose the sleptons are given vev ; then for any values of @xmath71 satisfying 2 > - , [ ufbthree - h ] the ufb-3 potential is defined as v_ufb-3=[-^2+m_l_i^2]2 ^ 2+[m_l_j^2 + m_e_j^2+m_l_i^2]2- .",

    "note that we could substitute squarks for sleptons , where @xmath79 is allowed .",

    "( [ ufbthree ] ) , the region of the parameter space where @xmath82 is large and negative is very susceptible to be ruled out by the ufb-3 condition .",
    "this is because the first term of eq .",

    "however , the second term in ( [ ufbthree ] ) , which is positive definite , may become competitive in certain cases ( _ e.g. _ , for @xmath83 , when the yukawa coupling in the denominator is small ) , which directions one should avoid when looking for the dangerous minima .",
    "@xmath84 with sleptons was found to be the strongest among all the ufb and ccb constraints in the low @xmath5 case @xcite .",
    "in order to get the optimum result one has to take the largest @xmath85 in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ ufbthree ] ) , which leads to the choice @xmath86 .",
    "now the restriction @xmath87 requires @xmath88 or @xmath89 and excludes the choice @xmath90 . in the low @xmath5 case this restriction , however , is of little consequence since all the left sleptons are degenerate to a very good approximation .",
    "the ufb -3 constraint with squarks may also be imposed by the following replacements in ( [ ufbthree ] ) : e d ,   _ e_j _",

    "however , since the choice @xmath79 is permitted , @xmath94 is not excluded . at high negative @xmath18 and at high @xmath5 , @xmath95 becomes smaller than the corresponding mass parameters of the first two generations .",
    "the variation of left - handed slepton mass parameters with @xmath18 ( for @xmath70 ) is shown in fig .  4 .",
    "this relatively small @xmath95 at high @xmath5 may make the alternative choice ( [ replace ] ) more restrictive than the ufb-3 condition with sleptons .",
    "this , in fact , has been supported by our numerical computations .",
    "we now briefly review our methodology for implementing the yukawa unification and computing the spectrum which is based on the computer program isasugra , a part of the isajet package .",

    "the parameter space allowed by @xmath0 yukawa unification expands considerably from the conventional scenario for @xmath136 .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath137 in fig .",
    "9 which should be compared with fig .  6 . in this case",
    "yukawa unification is achieved for relatively low @xmath5 , which in turn makes @xmath64 less negative and hence the ufb-1 constraint weaker to some extent . however , many of the new points so allowed are eaten up by the ufb-3 condition . as a result , there is an upper bound on the allowed values of @xmath24 for the range of @xmath25 studied by us @xmath138 tev ) .",
    "moreover , the gluino is most likely to be observed at the lhc for this _ entire _ range .",
    "also the theoretical lower bound on @xmath25 gets stronger .",
    "however , the ufb conditions become ineffective as the magnitude of @xmath18 is reduced keeping its sign negative . at @xmath132 hardly any point is ruled out by these ufb conditions .",
    "this trend is similar to what we obtained for the conventional scenario .    on the otherhand , for @xmath139 the aps due to yukawa unification alone",
    "is reduced quite a bit .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "10 with @xmath140 , which should be compared with figures 6 and 9 . for relatively large @xmath25",
    ", ufb-1 is a strong constraint as before , while some portion in the low @xmath25 region may be ruled out by the ufb-3 condition .",
    "we see that the lower bound on @xmath25 is significantly weaker than that in the previous case and @xmath25 as low as 300 gev is allowed .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath24 is also weakened considerably . yet",
    "an observable gluino is predicted over most part of the aps .",
    "we now consider the scenario with @xmath1 yukawa unification ( within an accuracy of 10% ) in the conventional scenario .",
    "the ufb-1 condition completely rules out the aps allowed by the unification criterion alone for @xmath20 .",
    "( ufb-2 and ufb-3 conditions do not play any major role in constraining the aps . ) for @xmath134 , the aps ( allowed by yukawa unification ) expands gradually ; though a portion of it is ruled out by the ufb-1 constraint , a significant amount still remains allowed , and a sizable fraction of it is accessible at the lhc .",
    "the ufb-1 condition gets weaker as we go to larger values of @xmath18 . in fig .  11 , we show the allowed region for @xmath141 and @xmath142 ; in fig .  12 , we introduce nonuniversality by setting @xmath140 .",
    "note that in the latter case the aps allowed by yukawa unification alone is somewhat smaller than that in the conventional msugra scenario .",
    "lastly , if the accuracy of the yukawa unification is reduced to some extent ( say , to 20% ) the aps allowed by the unification criterion alone is significantly enhanced .",
    "however , the ufb-1 constraint rules out a large amount of this space , and only a small portion survives for negative @xmath18 .    to summarize , the aps for large negative @xmath18 is so restricted by the ufb conditions that one should be able , with a bit of luck , to test the yukawa unification models that we have discussed at the lhc by checking the squark and gluino masses .",
    "this restriction weakens if one goes to algebraically larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "the quantitative nature obviously depends on the model chosen .",
    "we have analyzed the consequences of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 yukawa unifications in conjunction with the ufb conditions in the msugra scenario . in the forrmer case , for @xmath143",
    ", these two constraints nicely complement each other in restricting the aps ; when one is weak , the other is sufficiently strong ( see figures 6 and 7 ) . for @xmath144",
    "the ufb constraints are rather weak",
    ". however , the requirement of yukawa unification at an accuracy less than @xmath145 by itself squeezes the aps sufficiently . as a result , both @xmath8 and @xmath10 are bounded ( see fig .  8 for details ) from below as well as above .",
    "bulk of this restricted aps is within the striking range of the lhc . for large positive values of @xmath18 ,",
    "both the ufb conditions and the yukawa unification constraint weaken and a large region of the parameter space accessible at the lhc is permitted .    the most restrictive model that we have studied is the one with @xmath146 . here , mainly due to the ufb-3 constraint , one obtains @xmath147 tev for @xmath148 tev .",
    "such gluinos are obviously within the reach of the lhc . for @xmath134 ,",
    "the ufb constraints lose their effectiveness and the loosely restricted aps is rather large .",
    "if the accuracy of @xmath0 unification is relaxed , the aps tends to increase as expected .",
    "however , the upper bound as mentioned above , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath147 tev for @xmath148 tev more or less holds for large negative @xmath18 , thanks to the ufb-3 condition .",
    "the requirement of yukawa unification is less effective in the nonuniversal scenario with @xmath149",
    ". nevertheless the model on the whole is quite restrictive due to the ufb constraints .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "9 for @xmath150 and @xmath146 . here a gluino observable at the lhc is almost definitely predicted for @xmath151 tev . on the otherhand , for @xmath152 , yukawa unification by itself",
    "strongly constrains the aps ( see fig .",
    "10 ) and the ufb constraints play a subdominant role . again",
    "@xmath153 is predicted to be observable at the lhc over most of the aps .",
    "the masses of the third generation of sfermions are expected to be considerably lower than that of the first two generations for large values of @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "5 we display in the @xmath0 unification scheme , alongwith the ufb conditions , the masses of the lighter stop ( @xmath154 ) , sbottom ( @xmath155 ) and stau ( @xmath156 ) mass eigenstates as functions of @xmath18 .",
    "they are indeed found to be considerably lighter than the sparticles belonging to the first two generations ; in fact , the lighter stop could very well be the second lightest susy particle .",
    "thus in spite of the restrictions imposed by the ufb conditions and yukawa unification , light third generation sfermions can be accomodated .",
    "in particular , the possibility that the lighter stop is the nlsp is open for large negative @xmath18 .    the @xmath1 yukawa unification models , with a unification accuracy of 10% ,",
    "are definitely ruled out for @xmath20 in the conventional scenario . for positive values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the ufb-1 condition is less severe , and a portion of the parameter space remains allowed , of which a sizable fraction should be accessible at the lhc .",
    "if we relax the accuracy for unification , the aps increases , most of which could be ruled out by the ufb-1 condition .",
