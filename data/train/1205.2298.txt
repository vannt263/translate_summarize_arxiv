    "the advent of varying speed of light ( vsl ) theories@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite seems to shake the foundations of special relativity theory because the speed of light @xmath1 in vacuum is no longer constant .",
    "however , we must take care to investigate the veracity of such proposals . for this",
    ", we will take into account an extended relativistic dynamics due to the presence of an isotropic background field with temperature @xmath0 , where we consider that the energy scale at which a particle is subjected has a nonlocal origin , representing the background thermal energy of the whole universe ; i.e. , the particle should be coupled to the background field with temperature @xmath0 , which leads to a correction on its energy .",
    "this result will allow us to obtain the speed of light with an explicit dependence on the temperature of the universe .",
    "so we will be able to preserve the postulate of constancy of the speed of light and extend it just for the implementation of the temperature of the expanding universe . in this sense",
    ", we have a function @xmath2 and so we will find an enormous value for the speed of light in the early universe when its temperature was extremely high .",
    "in addition , we will also conclude that the high speed of light was rapidly damped to a value much closer to its current value even before the beginning of the cosmic inflation .",
    "this result will lead us to question vsl theory as an alternative explanation for the horizon problem .",
    "according to the relativistic dynamics , the relativistic mass of a particle is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is its rest mass . on the other hand , according to newton second law applied to its relativistic momentum , we find @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents an inertial mass ( @xmath8 ) that is larger than the relativistic mass @xmath9 ; i.e. , we have @xmath10 .",
    "the mysterious discrepancy between the relativistic mass @xmath11(@xmath12 ) and the inertial mass @xmath8 from newton second law is a controversial issue@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "actually the newtonian notion about inertia as the resistance to acceleration ( @xmath8 ) is not compatible with the relativistic dynamics ( @xmath12 ) in the sense that we generally can not consider @xmath13 .",
    "an interesting explanation for such a discrepancy is to take into consideration the influence of an isotropic background field@xcite that couples to the particle , by dressing its relativistic mass ( @xmath12 ) in order to generate an effective ( dressed ) mass @xmath14 working like the inertial mass @xmath15 in accordance with the newtonian concept of inertia , where we find @xmath16 . in this sense , it is natural to conclude that @xmath17 has a nonlocal origin ; i.e. , it comes from a kind of interaction with a background field connected to a universal frame@xcite , which is within the context of the ideas of sciama@xcite , schrdinger@xcite and mach@xcite .",
    "if we define the new factor @xmath18 , we write    @xmath19    where @xmath20 provides a nonlocal dynamic effect due to the influence of a universal background field over the particle moving with speed @xmath21 with respect to such a universal frame@xcite . according to this reasoning ,",
    "the particle is not completely free , since its relativistic energy is now modified by the presence of the whole universe , namely :    @xmath22    as the modified energy @xmath23 can be thought as being the energy @xmath24 of the free particle plus an increment @xmath25 of nonlocal origin , i.e. , @xmath26 , let us now consider that @xmath25 comes from the thermal background field of the whole expanding universe instead of simply a dynamic effect of a particle moving with speed @xmath21 in the background field , in spite of the fact that there should be an equivalence between the dynamical and thermal approaches for obtaining the modified energy . to show this",
    ", we make the following consideration inside the factor @xmath20 , namely :    @xmath27    from where we find @xmath28 , @xmath0 being the background temperature .",
    "@xmath29k ) is the planck temperature in the early universe with planck radius @xmath30 m .",
    "@xmath31gev ) is the planck energy and @xmath32 g ) is the planck mass .",
    "from the thermal approach , if @xmath33 , @xmath34 diverges .",
    "now we simply rewrite ( 2 ) as follows :    @xmath35    as the factor @xmath34 has a nonlocal origin and is related to the background temperature of the universe , let us admit that this factor acts globally on the speed of light @xmath1 , while the well - known factor @xmath36 acts locally on the relativistic mass of the particle .",
    "in view of this , we should redefine the equation ( 4 ) in the following way :    @xmath37[\\gamma(t)c^2]=\\gamma^{\\prime}m_0c^{\\prime 2}=mc(t)^2=mc^{\\prime 2},\\ ] ]    where now we have @xmath38 , so that    @xmath39    and from eq.(5 ) we extract    @xmath40    where @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .    from eq.(7 )",
    "we find that the speed of light was infinite in the initial universe when @xmath43 .",
    "as the universe was expanding and getting colder , the speed of light had been decreased to achieve @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "currently we have @xmath46 , with @xmath47k .    , which is the size ( radius ) of the universe as a function of time , and @xmath2 , representing the speed of light with dependence on the temperature of the universe according to eq.(7 ) .",
    "at the beginning of the universe when it was a singularity with a minimum radius of the order of the planck radius , i.e. , @xmath30 m , having the planck energy scale @xmath48gev which corresponds to the planck temperature @xmath49k and the planck time @xmath50s , the speed of light @xmath51 was infinite since there was no spacetime [ see eq.(7 ) for @xmath2 ] .",
    "but immediately after , when @xmath53k , the speed of light had already assumed a value close to the current value as shown by eq.(7 ) for @xmath2 , and therefore a cone of light ( a spacetime ) had been formed ; i.e. , with @xmath54 m/s for the present time , then , according to the function @xmath2 , we find @xmath55 m / s ( see the figure ) .",
    "subsequently , for @xmath56k , we find @xmath57 m / s .",
    "for @xmath58 m/s . and for @xmath59 m/s . finally , for @xmath60 m/s .",
    "from this temperature @xmath61k , when @xmath62s , corresponding to the energy scale of the grand unified theory ( gut ) with @xmath63gev , the universe inflated very quickly , starting with a radius @xmath64 m and reaching @xmath65 m at the time @xmath66s ; i.e. , the size of the universe increased rapidly 50 orders of magnitude . since the speed of light @xmath67",
    ", vsl should be put in doubt . hence ,",
    "perhaps the vacuum energy had played a fundamental role in that epoch . ]",
    "the change in the speed of light is @xmath68 , namely :    @xmath69    where , for @xmath45 , we have @xmath70 .",
    "we should note that the variation of the speed of light with temperature does not invalidate the postulate of constancy of the speed of light in special relativity since @xmath51 for a given temperature remains invariant only with respect to the motion of massive particles , but not with respect to the age and temperature of the universe . in other words , we say that , although the speed of light has decreased rapidly during the initial expansion of the universe and thereafter with a smooth variation as shown in fig.1 , its value for a given temperature ( @xmath2 ) is still a maximum limit of speed that is invariant only with respect to the motion of all subluminal particles .",
    "the modified spatial momentum of a particle moving in the presence of a cosmic background field with temperature @xmath0 is the following :    @xmath71    before obtaining the modified energy - momentum relation , we first introduce the modified 4-velocity , namely ,    @xmath72,\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . if @xmath33 , the 4-velocity diverges .",
    "the modified 4-momentum is @xmath75 .",
    "so , from ( 10 ) we find    @xmath76,\\ ] ]    where @xmath77 .",
    "the spatial components of @xmath78 represent the spatial momentum given in eq.(9 ) .    from ( 11 ) , performing the quantity @xmath79 , we obtain the modified energy - momentum relation as follows :    @xmath80    from which we get    @xmath81    where @xmath82 [ eq.(7 ) ] .",
    "it is curious to notice that the magueijo - smolin doubly special relativity equation ( @xmath83)@xcite reproduces eq.(4 ) when we just replace @xmath24 by @xmath84 and @xmath85 by @xmath86 in the denominator of their equation .",
    "figure @xmath87 reveals to us that , in the very brief time interval between @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the speed of light has collapsed from infinite to a finite value @xmath90 very close to its current value @xmath1 even before the beginning of the period of inflation where vsl theory attributes a very large speed of light around 60 times its current value .",
    "thus , based on our approach by taking into account the background thermal energy , the speed of light can not be used to explain the horizon problem , which leads us to think that there was a very rapid expansion of spacetime originating from a vacuum energy that is still poorly understood @xcite .",
    "the light has nothing to do with such an effect , since it came into existence first together with the initial singularity .",
    "all the subsequent cosmic evolution including the very rapid growth of spacetime ( inflation ) came after the light , whose speed was already practically established before the cosmic expansion .",
