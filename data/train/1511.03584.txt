    "this terminology , meaning that @xmath3 takes both positive and negative values , is nowadays quite common in nonlinear analysis , and it probably goes back to the papers @xcite .",
    "a further condition on @xmath3 naturally appears when dealing with problem , as already observed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "indeed , dividing the equation by @xmath14 and integrating on @xmath15 $ ] , we find @xmath16 hence , the existence of positive solutions can not be ensured if the weight function has nonnegative mean value whenever @xmath17 for any @xmath18 ( this is the case , for instance , for the model nonlinearity @xmath19 with @xmath20 ) .",
    "incidentally , we notice that the same considerations hold true for the @xmath21-periodic problem , as well as for the pde counterpart of problem , as a consequence of the divergence theorem",
    ". there is a rich bibliography showing that , under suitable supplementary assumptions on the nonlinear term @xmath22 and on the weight function @xmath3 , the average condition @xmath23 turns out to be sufficient to ensure the existence of positive solutions to , possibly also in the case when @xmath24 or @xmath25 changes its sign .",
    "the first result in this direction was given by bandle , pozio and tesei in @xcite , providing the solvability of the neumann problem associated with the elliptic equation @xmath26 in the sublinear case , i.e. , when @xmath22 behaves like @xmath27 both at zero and at infinity , with @xmath28 .",
    "later on , several statements for the superlinear case ( that is , @xmath22 like @xmath27 both at zero and at infinity with @xmath29 ) followed , both for elliptic neumann problems and neumann or periodic ode ones ( see , among others , @xcite and the references therein ) . in all these contributions , the average condition ( or the corresponding one for the pde case ) plays a crucial role .",
    "more recently , some attention has also been devoted to the so - called _ super - sublinear _ case , meaning that @xmath22 behaves like @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , at zero , and like @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , at infinity ; more in general , @xmath34 in this case , on the lines of classical works by amann @xcite and rabinowitz @xcite , it is convenient to write the weight function @xmath3 in as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , thus dealing with a parameter dependent equation like @xmath37 up to some additional ( mild ) technical assumptions , a pair of positive neumann solutions is then obtained when @xmath38 and @xmath39 is big enough @xcite .",
    "the largeness of the parameter is indeed essential , since nonexistence results can often be provided for @xmath39 small ( see again the previously quoted papers and remark [ parametri ] ) .",
    "it is a natural question , on the contrary , whether there are examples of neumann problems of the class admitting a positive solution when @xmath40 of course , in view of the above discussion , this is possible only if @xmath25 changes its sign on @xmath410,+\\infty[\\,$ ] . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "precisely , we will consider the case when there exists @xmath42 such that @xmath43 this of course implies that @xmath22 is bounded ( decreasingly converging to a horizontal asymptote ) , thus entering the setting of problems with sublinear growth at infinity .",
    "as for the conditions at zero , motivated by the existing literature , we choose to assume that there exists @xmath44 such that @xmath45 summing up , we thus deal with a particular type of super - sublinear problem ( indeed , condition is of course satisfied ) ; an explicit example of nonlinearity satisfying , and and thus fitting in our framework is given by @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "roughly speaking , we are going to show that , whenever and hold , the existence of positive solutions to is still ensured if the average of the weight function is `` positive but small enough '' . to express this in a formal way",

    "the assumption @xmath71 is crucial in order to show that the coincidence degree of a suitable operator associated with equals @xmath279 on small and large balls ( being on the other hand equal to zero on intermediate ones and thus providing the desired pair of solutions ) , while an analogous argument seems to be difficult in the case @xmath270 .",
    "[ parametri ] * the role of @xmath39 . *",
    "the role of the parameter @xmath39 deserves some comments , as well . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath39 is large enough one can easily find @xmath280 such that @xmath281 independently of @xmath165 ( just by taking @xmath282 contained in an interval where @xmath283 ) , thus providing a pair of positive solutions to for any @xmath71 , according to the discussion in remark [ variazione ] above .",
    "this agrees with the recent contributions @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", the possibility of finding positive solutions for _ any _ positive @xmath39 ( but @xmath165 in a bounded neighborhood of @xmath66 when @xmath39 is small ) could then seem a quite relevant novelty of theorem [ thmain ] .",
    "however , on one hand this is likely to be provable also with variational techniques , for @xmath71 ( carefully evaluating the functional @xmath284 on `` small , almost constant '' functions , so as to prove @xmath285 for @xmath165 near @xmath66 ) .",
    "on the other hand , we stress that the solvability picture given by theorem [ thmain ] has not to be misunderstood with the one for the single parameter equation @xmath286 ( that is , the differential equation in for @xmath287 ) , which is indeed the natural one when studying super - sublinear problems .",
    "actually , positive neumann solutions to do not exist for @xmath288 and @xmath39 small ( * ? ? ?",

    "this , however , is not a contradiction .",
    "indeed , the first part of theorem [ thmain ] is of local nature with respect to @xmath165 , providing solutions only in a neighborhood of @xmath66 ; from this point of view , we could equivalently have set @xmath289 and dealt with the equation @xmath290 .",
    "anyway , it is meaningful to keep the parameter @xmath39 as well , since this leads to the second part of our statement ( namely , @xmath67 for @xmath39 large ) which recovers part of the previously mentioned results .",
    "see figure [ pianolambdamu ] below .    * increasing nonlinearities . * by combining the arguments in this paper with the ones in @xcite , it is possible to prove the following : _ assume that and hold true and that @xmath291 let hold , as well .",

    "then , a standard change of variables transforms into an equation of the type @xmath307 , where @xmath308 is an indefinite weight with the same shape of @xmath309 . for more details ,",
