    "xte j1906 + 09 is an 89-s accreting x - ray pulsar that was serendipitously discovered in a 1996 _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ proportional counter array ( pca ) observation of sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite .",
    "two outbursts from xte j1906 + 09 have been reported to date , in 1996 september @xcite and 1998 august - september @xcite .",
    "the 1996 energy spectrum was well fitted with either a thermal bremsstrahlung spectral shape with temperature @xmath10 kev and @xmath11 @xmath3 or a power law with a photon index @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath3@xcite , when a fixed spectrum was assumed for the galactic ridge emission @xcite .",
    "the high absorption column density suggested that this source is at a distance of @xmath14 kpc .",
    "@xcite suggest that xte j1906 + 09 could have either a be star companion or a supergiant companion that is under - filling its roche lobe .    to date , about 80 accretion powered pulsars are known .",
    "these systems are often divided into 2 classes based on the mass of their companion : ( 1 ) high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) with ob companions ( 75 of the known systems ) and ( 2 ) low mass x - ray binaries ( 5 of the known systems ) with type a ( or later ) companions .",
    "the hmxbs are usually further divided into 3 classes based on the accretion mode of the system : ( 1 ) pulsars accreting from roche lobe filling supergiants that tend to have short spin and orbital periods , ( 2 ) pulsars accreting from the strong stellar wind of a supergiant companion which is under - filling its roche lobe that tend to have longer orbital periods and spin periods and show persistent but highly variable emission , and ( 3 ) pulsars accreting from the circumstellar disk around a be star that as a population show a correlation between their spin and orbital periods @xcite .    be / x - ray binaries are the most common hmxbs .",
    "they consist of a pulsar and a be ( or oe ) star , a main sequence star of spectral type b ( or o ) that shows balmer emission lines ( see e.g. , slettebak 1988 for a review . )",
    "the line emission is believed to be associated with circumstellar material shed by the be star into its equatorial plane .",
    "the exact nature of the mass loss process is unknown , but it is thought to be related to the rapid rotation of the be star , typically near 70% of the critical break - up velocity @xcite .",
    "the equatorial material forms a slow , dense outflow , which is generally believed to fuel the x - ray outbursts . near",
    "the be star , the equatorial outflow probably forms a quasi - keplerian disk @xcite .",
    "x - ray outbursts are produced when the pulsar interacts with the be star s disk .",
    "be / x - ray binaries typically show two types of outburst behavior : ( i ) giant outbursts , characterized by high luminosities and high spin - up rates ( i.e. , a significant increase in pulse frequency ) and ( ii ) normal outbursts , characterized by lower luminosities , low spin - up rates ( if any ) , and repeated occurrence at the orbital period @xcite .",
    "the target of the _ rxte _ observations , sgr 1900 + 14 , is a member of a small class ( 4 objects ) , called soft gamma repeaters ( sgr ) , which exhibit brief ( @xmath15 s ) , intense ( @xmath16 ) bursts of low energy gamma rays with recurrence times ranging from seconds to years ( see hurley 2000 for a recent review . ) these objects also emit x - rays in quiescence .",
    "a spin period of 5.16-s was discovered in the quiescent emission of sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite . the soft x - ray spectrum ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) of sgr 1900 + 14 consists of a blackbody ( kt @xmath17 kev ) plus a power law component ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the nominal unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev flux level is @xmath19 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath8 .",
    "however , both the flux and spectrum of sgr 1900 + 14 have been shown to vary substantially during periods of burst activity @xcite .",
    "effects from sgr 1900 + 14 were removed from the data whenever possible , but since sgr 1900 + 14 is always present in the field of view when xte j1906 + 09 is active , it contaminates measurements of the total flux and average spectrum of xte j1906 + 09 .    in this paper",
    "we will present results of a search for additional outbursts of xte j1906 + 09 in _ rxte _ pca observations from 1996 - 2001 , detailed timing and spectral analysis of the 1998 outburst , a comparison of the 1998 and 1996 outbursts , and a discussion of the possible nature of this system .",
    "the results presented in this paper involve data from the proportional - counter array ( pca , jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) and the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte , rothschild et al .",
    "1998 ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing experiment ( rxte _ , bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) .",

    "one of the four detectors in cluster b has lost all energy resolution , so this detector is not included in our analysis .",
    "each cluster can rock along mutually orthogonal directions to provide background measurements 1.5 to 3.0  away from the measured source every 16 - 128 s @xcite .    because xte j1906 + 09 is located 33  from sgr 1900 + 14 , a large number of pca and hexte observations have been made of this region .",

    "corresponding background light curves were produced using the ftool _ pcabackest _ with the faint source models .",
    "net light curves were then produced by subtracting the background light curves from the standard2 light curves .",
    "variances on the net count rates were computed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the model background rate .",
    "the background model has an estimated systematic error of 1% @xcite . because these observations are optimized for sgr 1900 + 14 , not xte j1906 + 09 , the pca pointing direction was frequently offset significantly from the xte j1906 + 09 position . pointing offsets to xte j1906 + 09 ( filled triangles ) and the bright 440-s pulsar 4u 1907 + 09 ( open squares ) are shown in figure  [ fig : offset ] .",

    "scanning observations have the largest error bars .",
    "gaps indicate times when the pca did not observe this region of the sky .",
    "the ftool _ xtecol _ was used to create collimator corrected light curves for the offset pointing .",
    "these light curves were then barycentered to the solar system barycenter using the ftools _ fxbary _ ( before 2000 december 31 ) and _ faxbary _ ( after 2000 december 31 ) .",
    "bursts from sgr 1900 + 14 , present in observations from 1998 august - september , were removed from the data using a simple algorithm that discarded data outliers .",
    "outliers were defined as points where @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the background subtracted count rate ( in 16-s intervals ) and @xmath25 is the median background subtracted count rate ( in 16-s intervals ) for that observation .",
    "a search for pulsations from xte j1906 + 09 was performed for each observation .",
    "observations separated by less than 4 _ rxte _ orbits were combined and count rates for all observations were corrected for varying numbers of pcus .",
    "the data from each observation were fitted with a model consisting of a constant term plus a second order fourier expansion in a pulse phase model .",
    "the pulse phase model used was of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a trial frequency , @xmath28 is the barycentered time associated with the net count rate , and @xmath29 is the midpoint time of the observation .",

    ". then we computed the average power @xmath31 for the frequency intervals @xmath32 $ ] , where @xmath33 is the pulse frequency and @xmath34 is the harmonic number .",
    "if @xmath31 was greater than the expected poisson level of 2.0 , we multiplied the variances on the corresponding harmonic amplitudes by @xmath35 to correct for aperiodic noise .",
    "this correction accounts for aperiodic noise dependent systematic differences in sensitivity from observation to observation .",

    "the two sources can usually be easily separated in power spectra and were successfully separated in all observations used for subsequent pulse phase analysis .",
    "the frequency search for 4u 1907 + 09 told us when that source was active and when we needed to check for contamination in xte j1906 + 09 measurements .",

    "collimator corrections generated for standard 2 data using the ftool _ xtecol _ were applied manually . for each observation within each outburst , initial pulse profiles were created by fitting harmonic amplitudes in a fourier series expansion in a phase model of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the average pulse frequency for each outburst ( 11.2150 mhz and 11.2158 mhz for the first and second outbursts , respectively ) from detections in our grid search and @xmath29 is the mid - time of each outburst .",
    "template pulse profiles were also created by fitting harmonic amplitudes in a fourier expansion in a phase model of the form in equation  [ eqn : phimod0 ] .",
    "for the first outburst , we used the brightest interval 50343.533 - 50343.838 ( 1996 september 17 ) to generate the template profile , with a pulse frequency of 11.216 mhz from our grid search .",
    "for the second outburst , we used a moderate intensity interval mjd 51072.829 - 51072.989 ( 1998 september 16 ) to create the template , with a pulse frequency of 11.213 mhz from our grid search results .",

    "only the first 12 harmonics were significant .",
    "the mean has been subtracted from these pulse profiles and for all other pulse profiles in this paper because the mean count rate includes contributions from xte j1906 + 09 , sgr 1900 + 14 , and in some observations , 4u 1907 + 097 . since rxte is not an imaging instrument ,",
    "the relative contribution from each of the three sources can not be determined .",

    "this is strongly suggestive of an orbital signature and is consistent with either a short , nearly circular orbit or with periastron passage in a much longer eccentric orbit .",
    "no clear signature is seen in measurements from the first outburst ; however , this is not surprising since the phase connected measurements only span 4 days and the outburst was much weaker .    to investigate possible orbits",
    ", we fitted a quadratic phase model and an orbit with a fixed period and fixed mass function to 23 connected phase measurements from the second outburst .",
    "the connected phase measurements from the first outburst spanned too short a time to improve our fits .",

    "observations of additional outbursts are needed to confirm these parameters .",
    "the 2 - 30 kev pulse profiles shown in figure  [ fig : tamp ] are similar despite being from very different time intervals and intensities . both consist of 2 main peaks with the first peak ( phase @xmath52 top panel ) being narrower than the second peak ( phase @xmath53 top panel ) . during the 1996 september outburst ,",
    "the source was much fainter than during the 1998 outburst .",
    "comparing the two profiles suggests that a correlation between the pulse shape and intensity may be present .",
    "the first main peak is much brighter relative to the second main peak in the pulse profile from the stronger outburst than in the weaker outburst . to further investigate this effect ,",
    "we phase aligned data from the 1998 outburst using the phase model in table  [ tab : poly ] .",

    "the second main peak ( phase @xmath55 ) gradually evolves from a broad peak approximately equal in intensity to the first main peak to multiple peaks with considerable structure as the pulsed flux increases . within the 1998 outburst , the pulse shape appears to be correlated with intensity .",
    "the pulse profile from the 1996 outburst looks consistent with the low intensity profiles from the 1998 outburst , suggesting that the pulse shape - intensity correlation holds for both outbursts .",

    "[ fig : profile_energy2 ] the pulse minimum becomes broader with increasing energy , also indicating spectral softening .",
    "the hardest spectral index is at phase 0.15 , corresponding to the dip present at low energies at phase @xmath70 , that disappears as energy increases , suggesting spectral hardening .    using our spectral model ,",

    "this suggests that the xte j1906 + 09 pulse fraction in the 2 - 10 kev band is approximately constant at 66% .",
    "the sky region including xte j1906 + 09 was regularly monitored with _",
    "rxte _ every few days from 1998 august to 1999 july and again from 2000 march - 2001 january as part of our guest investigation to observe sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "prior to the monitoring campaign , this sky region was observed regularly for about 2 weeks in 1996 september and again in 1998 may - june . a search for pulsations from xte j1906 + 09 in these observations resulted in the detection of two outbursts , 1996 september 17 - 18 ( mjd 50343 - 50344 ) and 1998 august 30 - september 24 ( mjd 51056 - 51080 ) .",
    "both outbursts have been previously reported @xcite .",
    "unfortunately our data can not unambiguously determine the orbital period of the system .",
    "the two detected outbursts are separated by about 730 days .",
    "this spacing may be an integer multiple of the orbital period , since normal outbursts in transient x - ray pulsars usually occur near periastron passage .",
    "outbursts similar to the 1996 outburst , which was detected for only 2 days in the frequency grid search and for about 4 days in pulse phase measurements , could have been easily missed because the observations of the region were usually at least few days apart even during the regular monitoring .",
    "the non - detection of xte j1906 + 09 in most of the observations tells us that this source is a transient source .",
    "the known companions of transient x - ray pulsars are all be stars ( with the exception of gro j174428 ) , hence xte j1906 + 09 most likely has a be star companion .",
    "the two outbursts differ considerably in peak intensity and duration ( figure  [ fig : freq1906 ] ) .",
    "the second outburst lasted about 25 days and was a factor of @xmath78 brighter in 2 - 30 kev pulsed flux that the first one which was very short , 2 - 4 days .",
    "although the second outburst was brighter and longer , it is unlikely that it is a giant outburst like that observed in some be x - ray binaries because giant outbursts are typically near eddington luminosity at their peaks ( e.g. bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) . assuming a distance of @xmath79 kpc , the 2 - 30 kev peak luminosity of the second outburst is @xmath80 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath8 , consistent with a normal outburst . in the pulse frequencies measured by differencing connected phase measurements",
    ", we see a distinct sinusoidal signature that is likely due to the orbit of xte j1906 + 09 ( figure  [ fig : outburst2 ] ) .",
    "two possible scenarios could produce this signature : ( 1 ) a short ( @xmath81 day ) , nearly circular , orbit or ( 2 ) periastron passage in a long , eccentric , orbit . accreting x - ray pulsar systems with short , nearly circular ,",
    "orbits are typically persistent systems @xcite and xte j1906 + 09 is clearly a transient system . the second case of periastron passage in a long , eccentric",
    ", orbit is what one would expect from a be / x - ray transient system .",
    "fits of a quadratic phase model and an orbit with a fixed orbital period and mass function yielded @xmath0 minima for orbital periods of 26 - 30 days and eccentricities of 0.03 - 0.06 .    an orbital period of 26 - 30 days is shorter than what would be expected from the general correlation between orbital and pulse periods in be / x - ray transients @xcite .",
    "4u 072825 @xcite and possibly gro j2058 + 42 @xcite may also have shorter orbital periods than expected .",
    "4u 072825 is a confirmed be / x - ray binary with a 103.2-s pulse period and a 34.5 day outburst period .",
    "gro j2058 + 42 is a 195.6-s pulsar with either a 55 or 110 day orbital period .",
    "odd - even pulsed flux variations in outbursts observed with batse may indicate the orbital period is 110 days @xcite ; however , observations with the _ rxte _ asm and pca do not show clear evidence for differences between the outbursts , suggesting an orbital period of 55 days @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the periods are outburst recurrence times , so pulse timing analysis of data with appropriate phase coverage is needed to confirm these as orbital periods .",
    "these three sources may be members of an unusual class of be / x - ray binary that does not lie on the general spin - orbital period correlation @xcite with most be systems .",
    "our grid searches also suggest that the eccentricity in xte j1906 + 09 may be quite low .",

    "1997 ) , and 2s 1553542 ( @xmath85 , kelley , rappaport , & ayasli 1983 ) .",
    "the system that appears most similar to xte j1906 + 09 is 2s 1553542 , which has a spin period of 9.3-s and an orbital period of 30.6 days .",
    "however , the orbit of this system was measured using a 20 day observation and the source has not been observed in outburst again . in both 2s 1553542 and xte j1906 + 09",
    ", the orbital parameters were determined using less than one orbital period and should be treated with caution .",
    "strong intrinsic torques , often correlated with the intensity of the pulsar @xcite , could easily produce misleading results in a short stretch of data .",
    "coupling between intrinsic torques and the orbit could lead to erroneous orbital parameters .",
    "observations of additional outbursts from both sources are needed to confirm the orbital parameters .",
    "if xte j1906 + 09 is a low eccentricity system , it is surprising that it appears to show only isolated normal outbursts .",
    "at least one other system , cep x-4 @xcite also showed isolated normal outbursts , but its orbit is unknown .",
    "the flux level of 2s 1553542 was not reported by @xcite , so it is unclear whether it underwent a giant or normal outburst .",
    "the viscous decretion disk model , which accounts for most properties of be stars , predicts the truncation of the circumstellar disk around the be star , due to the presence of the neutron star . in systems with low eccentricities ( @xmath86 ) , this model predicts that the truncation mechanism would be so effective that no normal outbursts would be seen at all .",
    "only giant outbursts would be expected when the disk was strongly disturbed @xcite .",
    "however this model fails to explain the series of normal outbursts in gs 0834430 @xcite .",
    "it also does not easily explain the 103.2-s pulsar 4u 072826 , which has not shown giant outbursts , but shows a 34.5 day modulation in its persistent flux @xcite .",
    "perhaps a moderate perturbation in the be disk , not large enough to produce a giant outburst , could produce the isolated normal outbursts we observe in xte j1906 + 09 .",
    "the transient nature of xte j1906 + 09 suggests that it is likely a member of a be / x - ray binary system .",
    "_ rxte _ pca scans during the second outburst of xte j1906 + 09 localized it to a 2  radius error circle centered on @xmath87 , j2000 @xcite .",
    "no objects were found in the error circle in the simbad database .",
    "we searched the catalogs at the high energy astrophysics science archive research center for a possible counterpart .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey faint source catalog contained no sources within 30of xte j1906 + 09 . although pointed observations of sgr 1900 + 14 were made with euve and bepposax , xte j1906 + 09 was outside the field - of - view in all cases .",
    "the asca galactic plane survey @xcite did not detect an x - ray source brighter than @xmath88 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath8 within 52  of xte j1906 + 09 .",
    "however , the 2  error circle contains no shortage of stars . in the usno a-2 catalog",
    ", we found 41 stars in the error circle , with b - magnitudes ranging from 15.9 to 20.0 and r - magnitudes ranging from 14.0 to 18.4 .",
    "if this sample of stars ranges over all distances ( as is likely in this case ) , each star will have its own color correction depending on distance , so comparing objects in the field is difficult . our @xmath89 values from table  [",
    "tab : spectra ] imply an extinction of @xmath90 @xcite , which makes it unlikely we will see the companion in the visible range . one infrared source was found in the error circle at @xmath91 , j2000 in the msx5c infrared point source catalog @xcite ; however , this object does not appear in the catalog of infrared observations .",
    "an x - ray observation with a very sensitive imaging instrument such as _ chandra _ or _ xmm _ , since xte j1906 + 09 would most likely be in quiescence , is needed to improve the location accuracy before a companion can be identified .",
