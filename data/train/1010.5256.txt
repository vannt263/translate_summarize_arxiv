    "superconductivity was found in @xmath4 x=0 - 1 system @xcite .",
    "this sytem shares properties with low-@xmath5 superconductors due to its low-@xmath5 and with high-@xmath5 due to its perovskite - like structure .",
    "it has a non - centro - symmetric lattice structure producing an asymmetric spin - orbit - coupling which violates pauli s parity principle allowing admixture of spin - singlet and spin - triplet states in the superconductor order parameter .",
    "@xcite such admixture of states with different symmetries induces an anisotropy in the order parameter , which depending on the strength of the asymmetric spin - orbit - coupling can lead to the existence of line nodes.@xcite as it is well know , the existence of line nodes in the order parameter allows quasi - particles excitations at low temperatures , affecting the density of states .",
    "@xcite line nodes also play an important role on the order parameter fluctuations near @xmath5 , since phase and amplitude fluctuations have different contributions in the node and in the anti - node producing a change in the density of states near @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite such a change in the density of states changes the shape of the asymptotic behavior of the order parameter near @xmath3 producing a deviation from the expected mean field behavior @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite    in this work we study the asymptotic behavior of the order parameter in @xmath1 and @xmath0 near @xmath3 using precision magnetisation measurements obtained as a function of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the work addresses the existence of phase fluctuations in the vicinity of @xmath5 which are expected if the gap contains line nodes due to the spin - triplet state admixture in the studied systems .",
    "we also analyse the diamagnetic magnetisation found near and above the transition temperature , @xmath3 , on both samples by fitting the diamagnetic signal above @xmath3 with the three - dimensional gaussian fluctuation schimidt expression , which explains most of the diamagnetic fluctuations above @xmath5 in low - tc ( s - wave bcs ) superconductors)@xcite , and by means of a lowest - landau - level scaling analysis @xcite ( critical fluctuations ) performed on data near @xmath3 .",
    "the work is motivated by reported deviations from the bcs - like expected behavior observed at low temperatures for the penetration depth @xcite and for the knight shift @xcite on @xmath7 which strongly suggested the existence of line nodes in this compound .",
    "also , it is interesting to investigate if the strength of the asymmetric spin - orbit coupling ( or the strength of the spin - triplet admixture ) observed in @xmath7 holds for @xmath0 . to the knowledge of the authors , there is no report in the literature devoted to diamagnetic fluctuations studies in the @xmath8 system .",
    "the experiment was conducted by careful and precise measurement of magnetization data by a 5 t mpms quantum - design magnetometer on @xmath1 ( @xmath5=8.1 k ) and @xmath0 ( @xmath5=5.8 k ) samples .",
    "samples were obtained by arc melting as described in refs.@xcite and are of high - quality each one exhibiting a single phase and sharp transition .",
    "all magnetisation data were obtained with sample cooled from temperatures well above @xmath5 in zero applied magnetic field .",
    "magnetic field was applied in the no overshoot mode and data was obtained by heating the sample with fixed increments of temperature ( 0.1 k in the region near @xmath3 ) .",
    "we also obtained field - cooled magnetisation curves , m vs. t , in order to obtain the reversible magnetisation .",
    "data were obtained from 1.8 k up to temperatures well above @xmath3 allowing to determine the normal state - magnetisation , mback , which was subtracted for each correspondent curve .",
    "and b)@xmath0 . the insets show magnetisation curves as obtained prior to background subtraction . ]",
    "figure 1a and 1b show magnetisation curves for both samples obtained after the proper background correction .",
    "the insets of fig.1a and 1b show data prior to background correction .",
    "we observe that the normal state magnetisation for both samples follows a curie - weiss type of the form , @xmath9 , but only for magnetic fields below 20 koe . above 20 koe , an additional linear term , ct , had to be include for @xmath1 ( small correction ) . for @xmath0 for fields",
    "20 koe ( very small correction ) and 30 koe ( small correction ) we used @xmath10 , where the additional ( log(t))/t term was included to account for the sample holder signal @xcite .",
    "this expression for @xmath11 fitted quite well the normal - state region curves . to check for this backgound correction we measured an isothermal hysteresis curve , m vs. h , in @xmath0 at 3.5 k , which shows magnetisation values that reasonably agree with the correspondent values in the corrected @xmath12 curve taken at h=30 koe .",
    "an interesting finding about the normal state magnetisation on both samples as shown in the insets of figs .",
    "1a and 1b , is that while the value of the constant @xmath13 is positive ( paramagnetic ) and increases with field for @xmath1 , it is negative ( diamagnetic ) for @xmath0 with diamagnetism increasing with field , as commonly found in high-@xmath5 superconductors .",
    "@xcite    in the next we shall analyze the reversible magnetization . since we are interested to study possible effects of phase fluctuation near @xmath3 it is more conveniente to plot the obtained magnetisation curves as @xmath2 vs. t , this is because near @xmath3 the quantity @xmath2 is directly proportional to the superconducting order parameter @xmath14 by the relation @xcite @xmath15 the well known equation ( 1 ) above was obtained upon application of the abrikosov approximation @xcite to the ginzburg - landau equation",
    ". curves of @xmath2 vs. t near @xmath3 allow to study the asymptotic behavior of the order parameter which can be expressed as @xmath16^m$ ] where @xmath3 is the mean field transition temperature and @xmath17 is the mean field exponent .",
    "the theoretical mean field exponent value is m=1/2 , for both @xmath18-wave bcs superconductors @xcite , and @xmath19-wave superconductors within a ginzburg - landau theory @xcite .",
    "since the studied system here have a low @xmath5 one would expect that neither amplitude nor phase fluctuations should play an important role , and the resulting transition should be of the mean - field type @xcite , with @xmath20 .",
    "however , the existence of line nodes in the order parameter can turn phase fluctuations important .",
    "it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the presence of nodes and anti - nodes in the order parameter has definite consequences for the phase and amplitude fluctuations , which can have an effect on the superfluid density of states , reducing the gap in the vicinity of @xmath5 . such change in the gap",
    "may alter the expected mean field value of the exponent @xmath17 , generating a larger value .",
    "@xcite in figs . 2 and 3",
    "are shown the resulting @xmath2 vs. t curves using the data from figs .",
    "1a and 1b respectively .",
    "for each curve we separate the region below @xmath3 where phase fluctuations may play an important role from the region above @xmath3 where amplitude fluctuations generate an anomalous enhancement of the magnetisation .",
    "the analysis is focused only in the reversible regime , and for this reason only @xmath21 curves obtained with fields above 5 koe are analyzed .",
    "values of @xmath3 are estimated in each curve from the extrapolation of the linear magnetisation to zero ( abrikosov method @xcite ) .     vs. @xmath22 for @xmath1 .",
    "the inset show @xmath23 , @xmath3 and @xmath24 plotted against h. ]     vs. @xmath22 for @xmath0 .",
    "the upper inset show the lowest - landau - level analysis results .",
    "the lower inset show @xmath23 and @xmath3 plotted against h. ]    we first discuss the general scaling analysis used to fit the region below @xmath3 .",
    "this region for each curve is delimited from below by a temperature below which the abrikosov approximation can not be applied , and from above by a change in the curvature of the curve , or inflection point , occurring near @xmath3 . within this region , each curve as appearing in figs .",
    "2 and 3 was fittted to the general form @xmath25^m$ ] where @xmath23 is an apparent transition temperature , and @xmath17 is a fitting exponent .",
    "deviations of the exponent @xmath17 from the mean field value 1/2 may infer a phase mediated transition .",
    "results of the fittings are shown for each curve .",
    "resulting values of @xmath23 for both samples are virtually the same as obtained from the abrikosov method mentioned above .",
    "so this method applied to the studied samples produces consistent values of the transition temperature .",
    "the consistence of the @xmath23 values is shown in the insets of figs . 2 and in the lower inset of fig . 3 where values of @xmath23 are plotted with values of @xmath3 .",
    "resulting values of the exponent @xmath17 for @xmath1 suggests a typical mean field behavior ( despite two values of @xmath17 are slightly larger than 1/2 , these values are well within the expected mean field value found for instance in nb @xcite ) .",
    "but , resulting values of @xmath17 for @xmath0 are much larger than 1/2 ( @xmath26 for all curves ) , and as discussed above , suggest a phase mediated transition , which is consistent with the existence of nodes in the order parameter .",
    "these results suggest that the strength of the admixture of singlet and triplet spin states in the order parameter is not negligible for @xmath0 but it is for @xmath1 .",
    "probably the admixture of triplet to singlet states in @xmath1 produces some anisotropy in the order parameter , but our analysis support the idea that there are no nodes .",
    "we now discuss the anomalous enhancement of magnetisation occuring in the vicinity and above @xmath3 as observed in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "our first attempt was to fit the diamagnetic signal above @xmath3 appearing on the curves of figs . 2 and 3 with the three dimensional gaussian - fluctuation expression derived by schimidt @xcite",
    "@xmath27 @xmath28 is a fitting parameter and it is expected to coincide with @xmath3 .",
    "the gaussian - type of diamagnetic fluctuations above @xmath3 is commonly observed in many superconductors systems of low-@xmath5 @xcite and also of some high-@xmath5 ( after taking off the short - wavelength fluctuations ) @xcite .",
    "results of the fittings with gaussian formula ( 2 ) for the magnetisation fluctuation on @xmath1 curves are shown in fig .",
    "the fittings are of excellent quality and the estimated values of @xmath28 are virtually equal to the values of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 are presented in the inset of fig .",
    "2 . on the other hand , gaussian expression ( 2 ) failed to fit the fluctuation magnetisation above @xmath3 on the curves of @xmath0 .",
    "the fittings conducted on the curves of fig . 3 for data in the region above @xmath3 produced low - quality fittings with values of @xmath28 much smaller than the correspondent values of @xmath3 .",
    "for example , we present a fit conducted on the 30 koe data above 2k where we fixed the value of @xmath28= 2 k. it is possible to see from this fitting that the fluctuation magnetisation observed above @xmath3 for @xmath0 is much larger than the contribution due solely to the gaussian - type of diamagnetic fluctuation . larger diamagnetic fluctuations below and above @xmath3 for high magnetic fields have been observed in many superconductor layered systems with large values of the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this situation is commonly explained in terms of lowest - landau - level , ( lll ) , fluctuations theories .",
    "lll theories consider fluctuations - fluctuations interactions within the ginzburg - landau formalism and predict specific scaling - laws that should be obeyed by the magnetisation and temperature @xcite . to perform the scaling @xcite one should replace the temperature @xmath30 and magnetisation @xmath31 of each curve to the respective scaling forms @xmath32 and @xmath33 and plot together all scaled curves .",
    "this scaling is appropriate to three - dimensional systems , as is the present case .",
    "the only free parameter in the scaling procedure is the mean field temperature @xmath3 which is adjusted for each curve so that all results fall onto a single universal curve .",
    "we applied this scaling approach on the reversible data of @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "1b for fields of 5 , 10 , 20 and 30 koe ) .",
    "the result is presented in the upper inset of fig .",
    "3 . one may observe that the collapse of the different m vs. t curves is almost perfect .",
    "values of @xmath3 obtained from the lowest - landau - level scaling analysis virtually coincides with values of @xmath23 ( lower inset of fig .",
    "this result evidences the importance of lowest - landau - level fluctuations on @xmath0 .",
    "importantly , the enhanced diamagnetic signal observed above @xmath3 in @xmath0 , which values are much higher than that expected from gaussian - fluctuations , is very likely to be related to the strength of the spin - triplet admixture in to the order - parameter , due to pt , which enhances the asymmetric spin - orbit - coupling when added ( by substitution ) to @xmath1 system . it should be noted that a similar scenario occurs in high-@xmath5 superconductors where phase fluctuations near @xmath3 is accompanied by enhanced amplitude fluctuations near and above @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite we also mention that we applied the same lll scaling approach on the reversible data of @xmath1 ( not shown ) producing a poor collapsing of the curves , which somehow agrees with the observation that the fluctuation magnetisation above @xmath3 in this system is well explained in terms of gaussian fluctuations , as addressed above .",
    "our work presents phase and fluctuation analysis results deduced from the experimental reversible magnetisation data measured on the @xmath34 , x=0 and x=0.2 , non centro symmetric superconducting system.results point on the existence of line nodes in the order parameter of the @xmath0 and a pure s - wave for the @xmath1 sample as for nb , confirming similar conclusions obtained from penetration depth , specific heat and knight shift measurements ( spin1,spin2 ) .",
    "the study also support the idea that the strength of the spin - triplet admixture in the order parameter of @xmath0 plays an important role on the amplitude and phase fluctuations near @xmath3 .",
    "diamagnetic fluctuations observed above @xmath3 in @xmath1 can be well explained by gaussian fluctuations , while for @xmath0 the diamagnetic signal above @xmath3 for higher fields are much higher than the values expected by gaussian fluctuations and likely well explained by critical three - dimensional lowest - landau - level fluctuations .",
    "amplitude and phase fluctuation scaling analysis of the experimental magnetization data turns to be a convenient and relatively simple method to study unconventional systems as in this case of the non centro symmetric superconductors showing particular non s - wave features .",
