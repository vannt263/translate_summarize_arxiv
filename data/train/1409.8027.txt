    "this paper is about how the _ sp theory of intelligence _ and its realisation in the _ sp machine _ ( both of them to be described ) may help in the design of the information - processing ` brains ' of autonomous robots.^,^ here , ` autonomous robots ' are ones that do not depend on external intelligence ( natural or artificial ) , do not depend on external power supplies , and are mobile .",
    "we shall also assume that a goal in their development is to provide them with human - like versatility and adaptability in intelligence .",
    "the paper is relevant to robots that are not autonomous in the sense just described , but the problems to be addressed are most acute in robots that are intended to function autonomously , and potential solutions are correspondingly more interesting .    in brief , the problems and potential solutions to be discussed are :    * _ computational efficiency , the use of energy , and the size and weight of computers_. if a robot is to be autonomous in the sense outlined above , it needs a brain that is efficient enough to do all the necessary processing without external assistance , does not require an industrial - scale power station to meet its energy demands , and is small enough and light enough to be carried around easily  things that are difficult or impossible to achieve with current technologies .",
    "+ the sp system may help : by reducing the size of data to be processed ; by exploiting statistical information that the system gathers as an integral part of how it works ; and via a new version of donald hebb s @xcite concept of a `` cell assembly '' . * _ towards human - like versatility in intelligence_. if a robot is to operate successfully in an environment where people can not help , or where such opportunities are limited , it needs as much as possible of the versatility in intelligence that people may otherwise provide . +",
    "the sp system demonstrates versatility via its strengths in areas such as unsupervised learning , natural language processing , pattern recognition , information retrieval , several kinds of reasoning , planning , problem solving , and more . +",
    "but the sp system is not simply a kludge of different ai functions . owing to its focus on simplification and integration of concepts in computing and cognition ( section [ outline_of_sp_system ] ) , it promises to reduce or eliminate unnecessary complexity and to avoid awkward incompatibilities between poorly - integrated subsystems .",
    "and like any theory that simplifies and integrates a good range of observations and concepts , it promises deeper insights and better solutions to problems than may otherwise be achieved . * _ towards human - like adaptability in intelligence_. amongst the ai capabilities of the sp system mentioned above , unsupervised learning has particular significance because of its potential as a key to human - like adaptability in intelligence , both directly and as a basis for other kinds of learning .",
    "these problems and their potential solutions are discussed in sections [ efficiency_energy_bulk_section ] , [ towards_versatility_section ] , and [ towards_adaptability_section ] , below . as a foundation for those three sections",
    ", there is an outline of the sp theory in section [ outline_of_sp_system ] , with pointers to where further information may be found .      like any good theory",
    ", the sp theory has a wide range of potential applications , some of which are described in @xcite . for reasons indicated above , and expanded in sections [ efficiency_energy_bulk_section ] , [ towards_versatility_section ] , and [ towards_adaptability_section ] ,",
    "the sp theory is particularly relevant to the development of the brains of autonomous robots .",
    "but mere assertion is not enough .",
    "this paper aims to explain why the sp theory is relevant to the development of robot brains and how it may be applied in that area .",
    "it is a considerable expansion of the short discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.3 ) , with much new thinking , and it is substantially different from other publications in the sp programme of research ( section [ outline_of_sp_system ] ) . to help make the paper comprehensible and readable , it includes summaries of material that has been presented more fully elsewhere .",
    "unnecessary repetition of information has been minimised and there are frequent pointers to where more detailed information may be found .",
    "the approach is radically different from other work in robotics because of its distinctive features ( section [ distinctive features_section ] ) , especially the concept of multiple alignment ( section [ ma_section ] ) .",
    "as will be seen in the body of the paper , this new approach has considerable potential in the three main areas that are addressed .",
    "autonomous robots have set a new challenge for the sp theory : how to process parallel streams of information .",
    "this has led to important new refinements of the theory , described in sections [ interactions_regularities_section ] , [ exploration_play_section ] , and [ learning_skills_section ] , and in appendix [ parallel_streams_of_information_section ] .",
    "the paper also includes new thinking about the identification of low - level perceptual features ( appendix [ identification_of_symbols_section ] ) and about quantification in the sp system ( appendix [ quantification_section ] ) .",
    "in this section , and elsewhere in the paper , the aim is to describe the sp theory with enough detail to ensure that the rest of the paper makes sense .    the sp theory is a unique attempt to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence , mainstream computing , mathematics , and human perception and cognition , with information compression as a unifying theme .",
    "the theory is described most fully in @xcite and at some length in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the present paper , potential benefits and applications of the theory are described in @xcite ( an overview ) , @xcite ( how the sp system may help to solve problems associated with big data ) , @xcite ( application of the sp theory to the understanding of natural vision and the development of computer vision ) , @xcite ( application of the sp system to medical diagnosis ) , and @xcite ( the sp system as an intelligent database ) .",
    "the sp theory is realised in the form of a computer model , sp70 , which may be regarded as a first version of the _",
    "sp machine_.    expressing the theory in the form of a computer model helps to reduce vagueness in the theory .",
    "perhaps more importantly , it provides a means of testing candidate ideas . as a result of such testing",
    ", many seemingly - promising ideas have been rejected .",
    "the model is also a means of demonstrating what can be achieved with the system .",
    "an outline of how the sp computer model works may be found in ( * ? ? ?",

    "fully commented source code for the sp70 computer model may be downloaded via a link near the bottom of http://www.cognitionresearch.org/sp.htm[www.cognitionresearch.org/sp.htm ] .",
    "it is envisaged that the sp computer model will be the basis for the creation of a high - parallel , open - source version of the sp machine , hosted on an existing high - performance computer .",

    "how things may develop is shown schematically in figure [ sp_machine_figure ] .          in the sp system",
    ", knowledge is represented with arrays of atomic _ symbols _ in one or two dimensions called _",
    "patterns_. the sp70 computer model works with 1d patterns but it is envisaged that the system will be generalised to work with 2d patterns ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.3 ) .",
    "a ` symbol ' in the sp system is simply a mark that can be matched with any other symbol to determine whether it is the same or different : no other result is permitted .    with one exception ,",
    "any meaning associated with a given sp symbol or combination of symbols must be expressed using other sp symbols .",
    "the exception is where an sp symbol connects with an entity or value outside the sp system .",
    "for example , a signal from a sensor in an autonomous robot , or an instruction for one of the robot s muscles to contract , may be represented by a symbol within the sp system .",
    "although conventional computing systems make extensive use of numbers , the sp system , in itself , makes no provision for the representation or processing of numbers .",
    "possible responses to this feature of the sp system are discussed in appendix [ quantification_section ] .",
    "the way in which sp symbols may be identified in such things as images , speech , and music , is discussed in appendix [ identification_of_symbols_section ] .    in themselves ,",
    "sp patterns are not particularly expressive . but within the multiple alignment framework ( section [ ma_section ] ) , they support the representation and processing of a wide variety of kinds of knowledge ( section [ ma_knowledge_section ] ) .",
    "a goal of the sp research programme is to establish one system for the representation and processing of _ all _ kinds of knowledge ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iii ) ) .",
    "evidence to date suggests that this may be achieved with sp patterns in the multiple alignment framework .",
    "any collection of sp patterns is termed a _",
    "grammar_. although that term is most closely associated with linguistics , it will be used throughout this paper for a collection of sp patterns describing any kind of knowledge . ) , and partly because of the significance of grammars in research on principles of minimum length encoding . ]",
    "the sp theory is conceived as a brain - like system that receives _ new _ information via its senses and stores some or all of it in compressed form as _ old _ information .",
    "the emphasis on information compression derives from earlier research on grammatical inference ( section [ computer_models_of_language_learning_section ] ) and the principle of _ minimum length encoding _ ( mle ) @xcite ) .    at an abstract level",
    ", information compression means the detection and reduction of _ redundancy _ in information . in more concrete terms",
    ", redundancy means _ recurrent patterns _ , _ regularities _ , _ structures _ , and _ associations _ , including _ causal associations_. thus information compression provides a means of discovering such things as words in natural language ( section [ computer_models_of_language_learning_section ] ) , objects ( section [ building_model_of_world_section ] ) , and the association between lightning and thunder ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iii - a.1 ) , in accordance with the donsvic principle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) .",
    "the default assumption in the sp theory is that compression of information is always lossless , meaning that all non - redundant information is retained . in particular applications",
    ", there may be a case for discarding non - redundant information ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section x - b ) ) but any such discard is reversible .    in the sp system",
    ", information compression is achieved via the matching and unification of patterns .",
    "more specifically , it is achieved via the building of multiple alignments and via the unsupervised learning of grammars .",
    "these three things are described briefly in the following three subsections .",
    "the basis for information compression in the sp system is a process of searching for patterns that match each other with a process of merging or ` unifying ' patterns that are the same . at the heart of the sp70 computer model",
    "is a method for finding good full and partial matches between sequences with advantages compared with classical methods ( * ? ? ? * appendix a ) .",
    "that process for finding good full and partial matches between sequences is the foundation for processes that build _ multiple alignments _ like the one shown in figure [ class_part_plant_figure ] .",
    "this example shows the best multiple alignment created by the sp computer model when a set of new patterns ( in column 0 ) is processed in conjunction with a set of pre - existing old patterns like those shown in columns 1 to 6 . here , the multiple alignment is ` best ' because it is the one that achieves the most economical description of the new patterns in terms of the old patterns .",
    "the way in which that description or ` encoding ' is derived from a multiple alignment is explained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.5 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.1 ) . like all other kinds of knowledge , encodings derived from multiple alignments",
    "are recorded using sp patterns ( section [ patterns_and_symbols_section ] ) .",
    "this multiple alignment may be interpreted as the result of a process of recognition ( section [ pattern_recognition_section ] ) .",
    "the new patterns represent the features of some unknown plant and the old patterns in columns 1 to 6 represent candidate categories , at several levels of abstraction : species ` meadow buttercup ' ( column 1 ) , genus _ ranunculus _ ( column 6 ) , family _ ranunculaceae _ ( column 5 ) , and so on .      as outlined in (",
    "* section 3.9.2 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.1 ) , and described more fully in ( * ? ? ? * chapter 9 ) , the sp system may , without assistance from a `` teacher '' or anything equivalent , derive one or more plausible grammars from a body of new patterns , with minimum length encoding as a guiding principle . in that process , multiple alignment has a central role as a source of sp patterns for possible inclusion in any grammar ( section [ creating_candidate_patterns_section ] ) .      like most problems in artificial intelligence , each of the afore - mentioned problems  finding good full and partial matches between patterns ,",
    "finding or constructing good multiple alignments , and inferring one or more good grammars from a body of data  is normally too complex to be solved by exhaustive search .    with intractable problems like these",
    ", it is often assumed that the goal is to find theoretically ideal solutions . but with these and most other ai problems",
    ", `` the best is the enemy of the good '' . by scaling back one s ambitions and searching for `` reasonably good '' solutions ,",
    "it is often possible to find solutions that are useful , and without undue computational demands .    as with other ai applications , and as with the building of multiple alignments in bioinformatics , the sp70 model uses heuristic techniques in all three cases mentioned above .",
    "this means searching for solutions in stages , with a pruning of the search tree at every stage , guided by measures of success ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ; sections 3.9 and 3.10 ; chapter 9 ) . with these kinds of techniques , acceptably good approximate solutions can normally be found without excessive computational demands and with `` big o '' values that are within acceptable limits .",
    "the expressive power of sp patterns within the multiple alignment framework derives in large part from the way that symbols in one pattern may serve as links to one or more other patterns or parts thereof .",
    "one of several examples in figure [ class_part_plant_figure ] is how the pair of symbols `` < family >  ...",
    "< /family > ` ' in column 6 serves to identify the pattern `` < family > ...  ranunculales ...  < hermaphrodite > ...  poisonous ...",
    "< /family > ` ' in column 5 .    in the figure , these kinds of linkages between patterns mean that the unknown plant ( with characteristics shown in column 0 ) may be recognised at several different levels within a hierarchy of classes : genus , family , order , class , and so on .",
    "although it is not shown in the example , the system supports cross classification .    in the figure ,",
    "the parts and sub - parts of the plant are shown in such structures as `` < shoot > ` ' ( column 3 ) , `` < flowers > ` ' ( column 5 ) , `` < petals > ` ' ( column 6 ) , and so on .",
    "as in conventional systems for object - oriented design , the system provides for inheritance of attributes ( section [ reasoning_section ] ) .",
    "but unlike such systems , there is smooth integration of class hierarchies and part - whole hierarchies , without awkward inconsistencies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.2.1 ) .    more generally , sp patterns within the multiple alignment framework provide for the representation and processing of a wide variety of kinds of knowledge including : the syntax and semantics of natural language ; class hierarchies and part - whole hierarchies ( as just described ) ; networks and trees ; entity - relationship structures ; relational knowledge ; rules and several kinds of reasoning ; patterns and pattern recognition ; images ; structures in three dimensions ; and procedural knowledge .",
    "there is a summary in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iii - b ) , and more detail in section [ towards_versatility_section ] .",
    "owing to the close connection between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability @xcite , the sp system is fundamentally probabilistic .",
    "each sp pattern has an associated frequency of occurrence and probabilities may be calculated for each multiple alignment and for any inference that may be drawn from any given multiple alignment .",
    "part of the sp theory is the idea , described most fully in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11 ) , that the abstract concept of a _ pattern _ in the sp theory may be realised more concretely in the brain with a collection of neurons in the cerebral cortex called a _",
    "pattern assembly_.    the word `` assembly '' has been adopted in this term because the concept is quite similar to hebb s @xcite concept of a _ cell assembly_. the main difference is that the concept of pattern assembly is unambiguously explicit in proposing that the sharing of structure between two or more pattern assemblies is achieved by means of ` references ' from one structure to another , as described and discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 11.4.1 ) ) .",
    "another difference relates to one - trial learning , as outlined in section [ one_trial_learning_section ] .",
    "figure [ connections_figure ] shows schematically how pattern assemblies may be represented and inter - connected with neurons . here ,",
    "each pattern assembly , such as `` < np < d > < n > > ` ' , is represented by the sequence of symbols of the corresponding sp pattern . each symbol , such as `` < ` ' or ``",
    "np ` ' , would be represented in the pattern assembly by one neuron or a small group of inter - connected neurons .",
    "apart from the inter - connections amongst pattern assemblies , the cortex in sp - neural is somewhat like a sheet of paper on which knowledge may be written in the form of neurons .",
    "it is envisaged that any pattern assembly may be ` recognised ' if it receives more excitatory inputs than rival pattern assemblies , perhaps via a winner - takes - all mechanism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 11.3.4 ) . and , once recognised , any pattern assembly may itself be a source of excitatory signals leading to the recognition of higher - level pattern assemblies .",
    "information compression and concepts of probability are themes in other research , including research on bayesian inference , kolmogorov complexity , deep learning , artificial neural networks , minimum length encoding , unified theories of cognition , natural language processing and more .",
    "the main features that distinguish the sp theory from these other areas of research , and apparent advantages compared with these other approaches , are :    * _ simplification and integration_. as mentioned above , the sp theory is a unique attempt to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence , mainstream computing , mathematics , and human perception and cognition : * * the canvass is much broader than it is , for example , in `` unified theories of cognition '' .",
    "it has quite a lot to say , for example , about the nature of mathematics @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) . * * in terms of achievement , not merely aspiration , the sp computer model combines simplicity with the ability to model a wide range of concepts and phenomena in computing and cognition ( section [ towards_versatility_section ] ) . * * the provision of one simple format for knowledge and one framework for the processing of knowledge promotes seamless integration of diverse structures and functions . * _ the sp theory is a theory of computing_. most other research is founded on the idea that computing may be understood in terms of the universal turing machine or equivalent models such as lamda calculus or post s canonical system .",
    "by contrast , _ the sp theory is itself a theory of computing _",
    "* chapter 4 ) . *",
    "_ intelligence_. what is distinctive about the sp theory as a theory of computing is that it provides much of the human - like intelligence that is missing from earlier models . * _ information compression via the matching and unification of patterns_. in trying to cut through the complexity of some other approaches , the sp research programme focusses on a simple , ` primitive ' idea : that information compression may be understood as a search for patterns that match each other , with the merging or ` unification ' of patterns that are the same ( section [ mup_section ] ) . * _ multiple alignment_. more specifically , information compression via the matching and unification of patterns provides the basis for a concept of _ multiple alignment _ , outlined above ( section [ ma_section ] ) .",
    "developing this idea as a framework for the simplification and integration of concepts across a broad canvass has been a major undertaking . _",

    "] knowledge in the sp system is transparent and open to inspection , and likewise for the processing of knowledge . * _",
    "sp - neural_. as outlined in section [ sp - neural_section ] , the sp theory includes proposals  sp - neural  for how abstract concepts in the theory may be realised in terms of neurons and neural processes .",
    "the sp - neural proposals are significantly different from artificial neural networks as commonly conceived in computer science , and arguably more plausible in terms of neuroscience .",

    "those two things mean that the sp system , in the course of its operation , builds a statistical model of its data .    to flesh out this concept , it would probably be useful to examine it in quantitative terms , perhaps using the high - parallel version of the sp machine mentioned in section [ outline_of_sp_system ] .",
    "but in any study of that kind , it would be important to bear in mind that the effect of the concept in terms of computational efficiency is likely to depend on the computer architecture  real or simulated  in which it is applied . and to reap the full benefit of the concept , it will probably be necessary to apply it with an architecture that is quite different from the von neumann model .",
    "one such possibility is outlined in the next subsection .",
    "it is unlikely that problems of efficiency will be fully solved with robot brains in the von neumann style . as argued in @xcite ,",
    "`` what s needed is a new architecture for computing , one that takes more inspiration from the human brain . ''",
    "the sp system has potential as a foundation for that new architecture .",
    "sp - neural , the neural - inspired version of the sp theory outlined in section [ sp - neural_section ] , may help to promote computational efficiency in three main ways , as described in the next three subsections .",
    "sp - neural suggests one possible means of realising the idea , outlined in section [ efficiency_via_statistical_information_section ] , that computational efficiency may be enhanced by taking advantage of the statistical information that the sp system gathers as an integral part of how it works .",
    "it envisaged that , associated with each pattern assembly , will be some physiological analogue of the frequency of occurrence that is associated with the corresponding sp pattern ( section [ ic_prediction_probabilities_section ] , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 11.3.5 ) ) .",
    "we may suppose that , in the course of building neural analogues of multiple alignments , those physiological measures of frequency may serve to derive physiological analogues of the probabilities associated with multiple alignments , so that ` good ' multiple alignments may be distinguished from ` bad ' ones .    with that kind of mechanism , processing in sp - neural",
    "would be guided by statistical information as suggested in section [ efficiency_via_statistical_information_section ] . and",
    "since low - probability structures would be continually eliminated , we may suppose that much unnecessary processing would be avoided , with corresponding gains in computational efficiency .",
    "a potentially - important feature of sp - neural is that the hard - wired connections between pattern assemblies are always between symbols that match each other  and that can cut out a lot of searching .",
    "for example , the direct connection that can be seen in figure [ connections_figure ] between `` d ` ' in `` < d 0 t h i s > ` ' and `` d ` ' in `` < np < d > <",
    "n > > ` ' means that there is no need for any kind of searching to find the match between those two instances of `` d ` ' .",
    "since , as was noted in section [ efficiency_via_statistical_information_section ] , `` anything that increases the efficiency of searching is likely to increase the efficiency of computation '' , these hard - wired connections in sp - neural should mean increases in computational efficiency .",
    "these gains in computational efficiency are potentially large .      in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ix - b ) , it is suggested that the sp system may promote computational efficiency via a synergy with `` data - centric '' computing , meaning computing in which `` data processing [ is ] distributed throughout the computing system rather than concentrated in a cpu . ''",
    "@xcite and `` the processing and the memory [ is ] closely integrated to reduce the shuttling of data and instructions back and forth . ''",
    "( _ ibid . _ ) .",
    "that suggestion is not exactly wrong since , in the sp system , there is indeed a close integration of data and processing . but it needs to be qualified by two observations : 1 ) that there is really no place in the sp system for the concept of `` instruction '' ; and 2 ) that the process of finding matches between different portions of data may require transfers of information over relatively long distances .",
    "regarding that last point , we can not avoid such transfers by retreating to conventional architectures .",
    "it appears to be an unavoidable aspect of any system that aspires to human - like intelligence .",
    "if computational efficiencies can be increased , as outlined above , it seems likely that there could be corresponding reductions in the size and weight of computers .",
    "the development of sp - neural as a model for computing may also lead to reductions in the bulkiness of computers .",
    "the current generation of robots fall far short of human - like versatility in intelligence .",
    "if they have anything approaching human - like intelligence it is almost always in a narrow field such as driving a car , retrieved 2014 - 10 - 28 . ] or playing pool @xcite .",
    "this section aims to demonstrate how the sp system may promote human - like versatility in autonomous robots in several areas .",
    "unsupervised learning is the main focus of section [ towards_adaptability_section ] , while other aspects of intelligence are considered in sections [ simplification_integration_section ] to [ sequential_and_parallel_procedures_section ] below .",
    "versatility in intelligence ",
    "a major strength of the sp system  flows from the goal that has been central in the development of the theory : to combine conceptual _ simplicity _ with descriptive and explanatory _",
    "power_. this strength of the sp system chimes well with what is required in any autonomous robot that is to function effectively in situations where little or no help can be provided by people .      before getting on to specifics",
    ", we shall consider simplification and integration , and their importance in the design of autonomous robots . in that connection",
    ", some may argue that human - like versatility could be achieved with a collection of applications , each one dedicated to a particular aspect of intelligence .",
    "that being so , the argument may run , there is no need for an all - in - one solution like the sp system .",
    "but human intelligence is not like that :    * each of our concepts is , normally , a seamlessly - integrated amalgam of different kinds of knowledge .",
    "for example , most people s concept of a `` steam engine '' includes static and moving images , sounds and smells , associations with journeys by steam train , literary , historical and technical knowledge , and more .",
    "* there is smooth inter - working of different aspects of human intelligence  learning , recognition , reasoning , problem - solving , and so on  without artificial barriers or transitions .",
    "by contrast , a collection of ai - related applications would be merely a kludge that is likely to suffer from poor integration of knowledge structures and awkward incompatibilities between different subsystems .",
    "the key difference between the sp system and that kind of assemblage of ai - related applications is its central organising principle : simplification and integration of concepts across artificial intelligence , mainstream computing , mathematics , and human perception and cognition .",
    "there is potential in that principle for autonomous robots to achieve the kind of seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse kinds of processing that is a hallmark of human intelligence .",
    "the following three subsections expand on aspects of the principle and its apparent importance in the design of autonomous robots .",
    "simplification in the sp system flows from two main things :    * the adoption of one simple format  sp patterns  for the representation of all kinds of knowledge .",
    "* one computational framework , with multiple alignment centre - stage , for all kinds of processing .    like a database management system or a ` shell ' for an expert system , the sp system provides one framework that can be loaded with different bodies of knowledge according to need . as with database management systems ( dbmss ) and expert - system shells , this cuts out the need to recreate the framework for each new application , meaning that there can be a substantial overall simplification across a range of applications ( *",
    "* section 5 ) . the main difference between the sp system and any",
    "dbms or expert - system shell is the versatility of the multiple alignment framework , especially in ai - related functions .    in the design of autonomous robots ,",
    "this kind of simplification in software may have some impact on the bulkiness of robot brains .",
    "but potentially more important is how simplification of software may simplifying the creation , operation , and management of software , with corresponding gains in efficiency .",
    "even if the creation , operation , and management of software were to be fully automated  as is envisaged for the sp system  gains in efficiency are potentially significant .",
    "using one simple format for all kinds of knowledge and one computational framework for all kinds of processing is likely to yield a second benefit : the afore - mentioned seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and smooth inter - working of different functions . here",
    "are some putative examples :    * _ syntax and semantics_. it is clear that in the understanding of any natural language ( listening or reading ) and the production of language ( speaking or writing ) , there must be close integration and inter - working of the syntactic forms of language and what they mean .",
    "achieving that intimate relationship between syntax and semantics is likely to be made easier by using what the sp system provides : one simple format for both syntax and semantics and one computational framework for all kinds of knowledge . in support of that idea",
    ", it is known that , at least in english , some aspects of syntax can not be defined except with reference to semantics ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.2 ) . * _ recognition and learning_. although recognition and learning may be treated as distinct topics in text books , they are difficult to separate in practice .",
    "consider , for example , how a dog chases and catches a ball that is bouncing haphazardly across uneven ground .",
    "the dog must , of course , recognise the ball but , after every bounce , he or she must be constantly assimilating new information about the speed and the direction of travel of the ball . the sp system may facilitate that kind of close integration of recognition and learning by providing one simple format for knowledge and one computational framework for both recognition and learning . *",
    "_ knowledge representation and learning_. if lightning is represented in several different ways and likewise with thunder then , as noted in ( * ? ?",
    "* section iii - a.1 ) , it would be difficult or impossible to learn , without being told , that there is an association between those two things . for a learning system to detect the way in which lightning is normally followed by thunder , it seems necessary to get behind the variability of surface forms and derive new structures and associations from the underlying knowledge , expressed in some kind of universal framework for the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge ( ufk ) .",
    "likewise for other structures and associations . * . in any kind of criminal investigation ",
    "the subject of countless television dramas  there must be total flexibility to use any kind of knowledge  physical , chemical , social , psychological , legal , and so on  to narrow the field of suspects and find `` whodunnit '' .",
    "it is difficult to see how that flexibility may be achieved except by the use of a uniform format for all kinds of knowledge and one computational framework for the processing of those diverse kinds of knowledge .",
    "in general , the sp system provides for seamless integration of structures and functions , in any combination , in all the areas described in sections [ natural_language_processing_section ] to [ sequential_and_parallel_procedures_section ] .      the quest for simplification and integration in the sp theory accords with occam s razor , one of the most widely - accepted principles in science . in terms of that principle",
    ", the sp theory scores well , since a relatively simple framework provides an account of a wide range of concepts and phenomena .",
    "an often - repeated observation in science is that a good theory can yield ` deeper ' insights and better solutions to problems than would otherwise be possible .",
    "for example , einstein s theory of general relativity led to the prediction ",
    "confirmed by observation  that light would be bent by gravity , and it provided an account of the precession of the perihelion of mercury .",
    "the sp theory is beginning to show benefits of that kind :    * relatively new insights are the ways in which computational efficiency may be improved , with corresponding savings in the use of energy , via aspects of the sp system described in section [ efficiency_energy_bulk_section ] .",
    "* other insights , summarised in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) , including : a new and apparently improved method for encoding discontinuous dependencies in syntax ; seamless integration of class - inclusion hierarchies and part - whole hierarchies ; the use of one framework for both the analysis and production of knowledge ; and benefits for relational , object - oriented , and network models for databases .",
    "this and the following subsections , together with section [ towards_adaptability_section ] ( human - like adaptability ) , demonstrate some of the versatility of the sp system in areas that are likely to prove useful in autonomous robots .",
    "in addition to the learning of linguistic knowledge ( section [ learning_linguistic_knowledge_section ] ) , the sp system has strengths in the parsing of natural language , the production of natural language , and the integration of syntactic and semantic knowledge , as outlined in this section .",
    "these aspects of the system are described more fully in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) and in ( * ? ? ?",

    "although sp patterns are remarkably simple , it appears that , within the multiple alignment framework , they have at least the expressive power of a context - sensitive grammar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 5.4 and 5.5 ) .",
    "as previously noted ( section [ patterns_and_symbols_section ] ) , there is reason to believe that all kinds of knowledge may be represented , within the multiple alignment framework , by sp patterns .",

    ", most work on natural language within the sp research programme has made the simplifying assumption that natural language may be represented with a sequence of symbols , as in ordinary text .",

    "* for any given identification , or any related inference , the sp system may calculate associated probabilities .",
    "* as a by - product of how recognition is achieved via the building of multiple alignments , the system provides a model for the way in which context may influence recognition .",

    "the word `` learning '' has generally been preceded by the word `` unsupervised '' .",
    "that qualification means that learning occurs without the benefit of any kind of `` teacher '' , or the grading of learning materials from simple to complex , or the provision of `` negative '' examples of concepts to be learned , meaning examples that are marked as `` wrong '' ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite)and it also means that learning occurs without rewards or punishments ( section [ carrots_sticks_section ] ) .",
    "learning with assistance from those kinds of things is , of course , `` supervised '' learning .",
    "we may also distinguish between _ primary _ forms of learning ",
    "the learning of basic skills  and _ secondary _ forms of learning  the kinds of learning that depend on those basic skills . as an example , learning via lessons in schools and colleges may be regarded as a secondary form of learning that depends on such basic skills as being able to speak and to understand speech .",
    "learning by watching and imitating what other people do may also be regarded as a secondary form of learning because it depends on more basic skills such as the ability to interpret visual inputs in terms of people and the motions of their limbs , hands , feet , and so on .",
    "of course , there is really a hierarchy of skills and corresponding forms of learning , because a skill such as the ability to read  which would normally be learned as a secondary skill in school  may itself provide a basis for learning from newspapers , magazines , and books , from the internet , and so on .",
    "this paper focusses mainly on the learning of foundation skills . and a working hypothesis  with supporting evidence from research on the learning of a first language or languages @xcite",

    "arguably , be seen as the `` holy grail '' of research on learning , especially learning by autonomous robots . notwithstanding the undoubted importance of schools and colleges , it appears that much of what we know is picked up via our everyday experiences , without explicit teaching .",
    "unsupervised learning is what an autonomous robot would need in places like mars where it can get little or no help from a human teacher . and",

    "the multiple alignment framework that has been developed to meet those goals is quite different from the mk10 and snpr models , but the principle of minimum length encoding remains centre - stage . the multiple alignment framework is much more general : it can model hierarchical chunking where that is appropriate but it can also model several other kinds of structure as well ( section [ ma_knowledge_section ] ) .",
    "given that the sp research grew out of earlier research on language learning , it is pertinent to ask how the sp computer model performs in that area of application ? in brief , the answer is `` much the same as earlier models but still not as well as one might wish '' .",
    "more specifically , the sp computer model , like the snpr model , can derive plausible generative grammars from samples of english - like artificial languages , including segmental structures , classes of structure , and abstract patterns ( * ? ? ? * chapter 9 ) .    at present , the main shortcoming of the sp computer model with respect to learning is that it does not detect intermediate levels of structure and it can not learn discontinuous dependencies in natural language syntax ( * ? ? ?",

    "although the two phases just described have the flavour of batch processing , they may be adapted for an incremental style of working : processing new information as it is received and building collections of old patterns that may serve in the economical encoding of new patterns that are received later .    the two phases are described in a little more detail in the following to subsections .      in sp70 , candidate patterns for inclusion in the repository of old patterns are derived from multiple alignments like the one shown in figure [ learning_alignment_figure ] . here , the pattern shown in row 1 is an analogue of something that a child has heard ( `` t h a t b o y r",
    "u n s ` ' ) with the addition of code symbols `` < ` ' , `` % 1 ` ' , `` 9 ` ' , and `` > ` ' , while the pattern in row 0 ( `` t h a t g i r l r u n s ` ' ) is an analogue of something that the same child has heard later .",

    "in addition , the program assigns code symbols to the newly - created patterns so that `` t h a t ` ' becomes `` < % 7 12 t h a t > ` ' , `` r u n s ` ' becomes `` < % 8 13 r u n s > ` ' , and so on . and , using those code symbols , the program creates an abstract pattern , `` < % 10 16 < % 7 > < % 9 > < % 8 > > ` ' , that records the whole sequence .",
    "the overall result in this example is the set of patterns shown in figure [ learning_patterns_figure ] .",

    "but the wrong grammars are progressively weeded out , as described next .",
    "as noted in section [ heuristic_search_section ] , the system exploits principles of heuristic search to cope with complexity : for any given body of new patterns , * i * , the system explores the abstract space of possible grammars in stages ; at each stage , in accordance with the principle of minimum length encoding ( section [ computer_models_of_language_learning_section ] ) , each candidate grammar is evaluated in terms of the size of ( @xmath1 ) ; and , at each stage , grammars that perform poorly are discarded . in this way , the system may gradually develop one or more * g*s that perform reasonably well in terms of ( @xmath1 ) , and it may achieve these results without unreasonable demands on computational resources .",

    "examples include : limitations on how the robot s limbs may be arranged ; how pushing a mug or tumbler over the edge of a table means that it will normally fall and , very often , break when it hits the floor ; how striking a bell will produce one kind of sound while striking a lump of wood will produce another ; the damage and pain that can be caused by walking into a brick wall or going too close to a fire ; sensations of strain if the robot tries to lift something that is too heavy ; the way night follows day and day follows night ; and the way that puddles evaporate , especially when the sun shines .    in broad terms , these many regularities in the world and in the way that a robot may interact with the world may be learned in the same way that words and other syntactic patterns may be learned from samples of language : candidate patterns may be identified via multiple alignment ( section [ creating_candidate_patterns_section ] ) and ` good ' grammars ( collections of sp patterns ) may be compiled via heuristic search ( section [ compiling_alternative_grammars_section ] ) .",
    "the key difference between learning syntactic structures from a one - dimensional sample of text and learning the kinds of regularities considered here is that the latter comprise arbitrary combinations of sights , sounds , sensations from tactile and proprioceptive receptors , tastes , smells , and so on ; and that , very often , these inputs may be seen to comprise parallel streams of information in which two or more events may occur simultaneously .",
    "this difference between learning from a one - dimensional stream of information and learning from parallel streams of information may be accommodated with three refinements of the sp70 model :    * _ represent parallel streams of information with 2d patterns_. if , as envisaged , the sp system is generalised to work with 2d patterns , such patterns may serve to represent parallel streams of information , as described in appendix [ parallel_streams_of_information_section ] . * _ generalise the sequence alignment process to the matching of 2d patterns_. the method for finding good full and partial matches between patterns ( section [ mup_section ] ) may be generalised to create an equivalent capability with 2d patterns . *",

    "it is envisaged that this kind of capability may be generalised to two dimensions and will then provide , in conjunction with heuristic search for good grammars ( section [ compiling_alternative_grammars_section ] ) , a powerful means of finding recurrent patterns in parallel streams of information ( or images ) despite noise in the data .      a robot that spends most of its existence sitting quietly in a cupboard",
    "might never know that night follows day or that puddles evaporate . in order to learn these humdrum features of the world",
    " things that may seem too elementary and obvious to be taught ( section [ forms_of_learning_section])our knowledge - hungry robot must explore .",
    "robots that aspire to human - like intelligence must get about in the world and have varied experiences , as people do .    in a similar way , a robot that does not move or interact with the world can not learn how its own body works , or the effects of its actions on its surroundings , or the impact of its surroundings on itself .",
    "like people , especially children , robots must play .",
    "this is not merely a time - wasting indulgence , it is an essential part of learning the recurrent patterns that govern how people or robots may function in the world , including minor skills .",
    "although introspection can be a poor guide to mental processes , something may be gained from considering our experience in learning simple skills such as the childhood favourite : wiggling one s ears . in learning something like that , it is initially hard to know what to do , but then things gradually take shape .",
    "what seems to be happening is that we are trying out different combinations and sequences of muscle contractions and of relaxations of muscles to discover what works . those combinations and sequences , with feedback about what does and does not work , may be represented as parallel streams of information in 2d patterns , as described in appendix [ parallel_streams_of_information_section ] .",
    "in addition to the knowledge and skills that may be gained via exploration and play , an autonomous robot , like a person , is likely to need more elaborate skills .    as a rough generalisation in that connection ,",
    "the current generation of robots often have the benefit of artificial aids or simplifications of tasks , their skills are normally programmed by people , case by case , and they are generally deficient in human - like abilities to learn new skills for themselves .",
    "for example , the `` deep green '' pool - playing robot @xcite has the benefit of an overhead camera giving a birds - eye view of the pool table , it is programmed with relevant knowledge of geometry and of newtonian physics , and it does not aspire to learn such things as how to make bread or how to play tennis .    although there is more to games like pool , billiards and snooker than merely potting balls , the process of potting a ball is a significant challenge for human players , especially with the large table of billiards and snooker .",
    "here we consider how that skill , and related skills , may be learned via the sp system under the same conditions as human players , extending the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.3 ) .    when a human player pots a ball , he or she strikes the cue ball with the cue , aiming to send the cue ball towards the target ball to strike it in such a way that the target ball is propelled towards a pocket and falls into it .",
    "skilled players may influence the behaviour of the cue ball or the target ball or both by imparting spin to the cue ball ( by striking it away from the centre ) . and in the course of a game , skilled players may combine the potting of the target ball with measures to ensure that other balls finish their movements in positions that are advantageous for the next shot . indeed , in snooker for example , the intention with some shots is not to pot any ball but merely to move balls into positions that make things difficult for one s opponent ( ie to create a ` snooker ' ) .",
    "since that kind of shot requires the same kinds of skills as are needed for potting a ball , our discussion will be about both kinds of shot . to simplify things in the discussion below",
    ", we shall ignore the fact that , in potting a ball , most human players will take advantage of depth perception via binocular vision .",
    "unlike the deep green robot , the human player depends mainly on a view along the cue towards the cue ball and beyond , without a birds - eye view of the table via a ceiling - mounted camera . unlike the deep green robot ,",
    "most human players have little or no formal knowledge of newtonian physics or geometry , and even if they had , the absence of a birds - eye view would make such knowledge less useful than it is for the robot .",
    "it seems likely that the performance of skilled human players in potting balls , in the use of spin , and in the positioning of balls , has little to do with physics or geometry and is much more to do with extensive experience via thousands of hours of practice .    the sp system may support that kind of learning in an autonomous robot as outlined in what follows",
    "for each shot :    * _ before the shot : parse visual input_. before the given shot is taken , the robot may assimilate information about the configuration of the table . in one or more views , the robot will see the cue ball , the target ball , other balls that may be on the table , and the target pocket ( when the intention is to pot a ball ) .",
    "each of those views may be parsed into its parts and sub - parts , much as in the parsing of natural language ( section [ parsing_nl_section ] , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) ) .",

    ", the sp system may have a useful role to play by compressing the information gathered about the demonstrated motion of the robot s limb or limbs .",
    "it has the potential , for example , to identify repeating elements in the demonstrated motion and to abstract them as distinct subroutines .",
    "more generally , it may create a grammar for the required motion including hierarchical structures , classes of structure , and so on .",
    "a potential benefit of this kind of information compression is generalisation of the demonstrated motion , without over - generalisation , as described in the next subsection .",
    "this may help to provide a degree of flexibility in the robot s actions .",

    "as we have seen ( section [ computer_models_of_language_learning_section ] ) , the principle of minimum length encoding provides a neat explanation of three aspects of language learning : 1 ) how we can generalise our knowledge from the finite sample of utterances which is the basis for our learning to the infinite range of utterances in the target language , * l * ; 2 ) how over - generalisations may be corrected without error correction by a teacher , or anything equivalent ; and 3 ) how people can develop a strong sense of what utterances do and do not belong in * l * when , in the vast majority of cases , there are errors in the sample of language that is the basis for our learning .",
    "naturally , these principles would apply to language learning by robots ( section [ learning_linguistic_knowledge_section ] ) .",
    "but it appears that the principles may also apply to the learning of non - verbal behaviour by a person or an autonomous robot :    * _ grammars for non - verbal behaviour_. a set of skills like those required for cooking a meal may be regarded as a kind of non - verbal language . in view of the generality of the multiple alignment concept and the learning mechanisms in the sp system , it seems likely that grammars for that kind of non - verbal behaviour , and others , may be learned in much the same way as grammars for natural language . * _ generalisation without over - generalisation_. while the grammar for cooking a meal would be derived from specific experiences , it may generate an infinite range of possible meals .",
    "but it is not totally general and will not , for example , enable a person or robot to play poker . * _ learning from dirty data_. in learning the skills needed for cooking a meal , we can be successful despite the likelihood that people that we learn from may make mistakes and cook books are rarely free of errors .",
    "a familiar feature of human learning is that it can be costly in terms of time and money .",
    "even with a natural talent , it can take a great deal of practice to become skilled in playing a musical instrument or in sports .",
    "people spend much time in education and training , mainly when they are young but also later in life , and schools , colleges and teachers all cost money .    an interesting possibility with autonomous robots and other artificial systems",
    "is that much of this cost may be avoided .",
    "this is because knowledge or skills that have been built up by one robot may be downloaded easily and transferred to any number of other robots .",
    "naturally , this works best when the several robots are identical but otherwise there is potential for adjustments to be made via learning when the recipient robots are similar to the donor robot but not exactly the same .",

    ", the sp system has potential for substantial gains in computational efficiency , with corresponding cuts in energy consumption and in the bulkiness of computing machinery : by reducing the size of data to be processed ; by exploiting statistical information that the system gathers as an integral part of how it works ; and via an updated version of hebb s concept of a `` cell assembly '' .    in the quest for human - like versatility in intelligence ,",

    "associated issues that have been discussed include : learning from parallel streams of data ; generalisation , correction of over - generalisations , and learning from dirty data ; how to cut the cost of learning ; and reinforcements and motivations .",

    "one such possibility is research with a high - parallel version of the sp machine , as outlined in section [ computer_model_and_sp_machine_section ] .",
    "this would be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it .",
    "this appendix and the ones that follow consider issues that are relevant to discussions elsewhere in this paper : how symbols may be identified ; how quantification can or should be accommodated in the sp system ; and how the sp system may represent and process parallel streams of information .    in the sp system , in the processing of things like text , it is a straightforward matter to equate individual characters , or whole words , with sp symbols . but identifying sp symbols is less easy with things like images , or recordings of speech or music :    * _ images_. one possibility with images is to treat each pixel as an sp symbol , where each pixel may be matched in an all - or - nothing manner with any other pixel .",
    "another possibility is , via some conventional pre - processing , to identify low - level features in images such as lines and angles and to treat such features as sp symbols .",
    "how that kind of thing may be done within the sp framework is discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) . * _ speech_. as with images , it may be possible to treat the lowest - level elements as sp symbols .",
    "alternatively , features such as white noise ( from fricative consonants ) , formants , formant ratios , and formant transitions , may be identified via pre - processing and treated as being sp symbols . * _ music_. a relatively straightforward analysis would equate individual notes ( including notes within chords ) as being sp symbols . as with images and speech",
    ", it may be necessary on relatively short timescales to use conventional pre - processing ( fourier analysis and the like ) to isolate individual notes within a stream of music .    of course , hybrid solutions , using conventional pre - processing in conjunction with the sp system ,",
    "are not as theoretically neat as when everything is done via the sp system , but they may be justified as short - term expedients . on longer timescales , it would probably make better sense to try to avoid the relative complexity of such solutions . in the processing of images , for example , there is potential for the sp system to isolate features such as lines and angles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 3.3 and 3.4 ) .",
    "in understanding any kind of skilled activity  playing tennis , cooking a meal , and so on  or creating robots that have such skills , it seems natural to measure things like the strength with which a tennis player hits a ball , and to express the measurements with numbers .",
    "but the sp system , in itself , makes no provision for quantification , neither analogue nor digital . ) but that is for internal use and not for representing something like the strength with which a tennis player hits a ball . ] at the lowest level in its knowledge , it deals with symbols which have no intrinsic meaning , numerical or otherwise ( section [ outline_of_sp_system ] ) . as noted in section [ patterns_and_symbols_section ] , any meaning associated with a given sp symbol or combination of symbols",
    "must be expressed using other sp symbols , or external equivalents ; and there is just one valid operation with an sp symbol : to match it with another sp symbol to determine whether they are the same or different .    in broad terms , there are three main ways in which quantification may be accommodated in the sp system :    * _ via densities of symbols_. the densities of different categories of symbols may serve to express quantities , in much the same way that the densities of black and white pixels may represent different shades of grey in a black and white photograph , at least as they used to be ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2.3 ) . * _ via the rules of arithmetic_. in principle , the sp system may express values as numbers and perform arithmetic operations if it is supplied with sp patterns representing peano s axioms and other knowledge about arithmetic .",
    "this has not yet been explored in any depth .",
    "there is relevant discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) . *",
    "_ do nt do it_. the simplest option is to avoid quantification altogether",
    ". this may not be as silly as it sounds , as suggested in the following discussion .",
    "although it may seem natural to quantify the operations of a robot and to represent quantities with numbers , those assumptions may carry with them an unspoken and possibly unjustified belief that increasing the size of a given value in the robot would normally increase the impact of that value in the robot s environment .",
    "for example , it seems obvious , and is probably true , that if an industrial robot fails to bend a metal bar with medium pressure , stronger pressure is likely to succeed .",
    "but the assumption of a linear or monotonic relationship between variables is often wrong .",
    "if we hold an egg in our hand with a grip that is too weak , we may drop it .",
    "but if our grip is too strong , the egg may be crushed .",
    "holding an egg works best with a grip that is neither too weak nor too strong .",
    "returning to our tennis player example , strong blows to the ball may score points on many occasions but with a drop shot , for example , a light touch is required .    in general , any person or robot must keep an open mind in learning how things work , without presuppositions about linear or quasi - linear relationships between variables . in that case , it is an advantage rather than a handicap if values like _ weak _ , _ medium _ , and _",
    "strong _ are represented with sp symbols without any presumption of a quantitative relationship amongst them , much as one would assume for values like _ red _ , _ sweet _ , and _",
    "curly_. elsewhere in this paper we shall assume that all values that provide input for a robot s learning are represented with standard sp symbols , without any quantitative meaning .",
    "in the development to date of the sp theory and the sp computer model , the main focus has been on one - dimensional patterns and what can be done with them .",
    "this can work well with some kinds of information , as can be seen in figures [ class_part_plant_figure ] and [ parsing_figure ] . in each case , the patterns in the multiple alignment may be merged ( unified ) to create a single 1d pattern .    in examples like figure [ parsing_figure ] ,",
    "the left - to - right ordering of symbols represents the time ordering of words and other structures in natural language .",
    "this is ok for a one - dimensional stream of information like ordinary text but is not satisfactory when there are two or more streams of information in parallel . here",
    "are some examples :    * _ speech_. in both the production of speech and in the acoustic signal of speech , there are normally several things going on in parallel .",
    "when we speak , there is simultaneous activity in our lips , tongue , cheeks , and breathing ; while in terms of acoustics , elements of speech such as vowel sounds may be distinguished , one from another , by configurations of simultaneously - occurring spectral peaks or formants . *",
    "_ spelling rules_. notwithstanding the ` whole word ' doctrine in the teaching of reading , it is widely recognised that , with english at least , skilled readers know many associations between configurations of letters and corresponding sounds : `` th ` ' =  or ; `` ch ` ' = ; `` ay ` ' = e ; and so on . in terms of before - and - after relationships",
    ", it makes most sense to say that a spelling pattern and its sound value occupy the same time slot . * _ music_. in music , especially orchestral music and music for the piano or organ , it is normal for two or more notes to be played at the same time . * _ natural language and its meanings_. the surface forms of spoken or written language , and the meanings of those forms , may be seen as parallel streams of information ( see also sections [ nl_parallel_streams_section ] and [ learning_linguistic_knowledge_section ] ) . * _ robots and their surroundings_. in considering the information that an autonomous robot needs to process , there are normally several streams of information running in parallel , in two main areas : * * _ the robot s environment_. as with people , there would normally be several things happening at the same time . in a typical office ,",
    "for example , there would be people talking , phones ringing , people coming and going , people working on keyboards , taking refreshment , doing photocopying , and so on .",
    "* * _ the robot s workings and its impact on its surroundings_. in any robot of reasonable complexity , there would be signals going to the robot s ` muscles ' , and , via sensors of various kinds , there would be information about the robot s surroundings , information about the internal workings of the robot , and feedback about the effects of the robot s actions on its surroundings .",
    "how should the sp system accommodate parallel streams of information ?",
    "the most straightforward answer seems to be to take advantage of what is in any case envisaged for development within the system : sp patterns in two dimensions .",
    "such patterns were originally conceived , and are still seen , as a vehicle for the representation and processing of images @xcite .",
    "but they may also serve in the representation and processing of parallel streams of information , as illustrated in figure [ parallel_streams_figure ] .        in this example , any given sp symbol ( shown as a numbered circle )",
    "may be assigned to a time slot ( one of the columns in the figure ) in one of five streams of information ( shown as rows s1 to s5 in the figure ) .",
    "the reason for introducing the notion of ` streams ' of information is to try to achieve some consistency across different configurations of symbols , and the reason for that is to facilitate the discovery of patterns that match each other , as indicated in section [ mup_section ] and amplified in section [ us_learning_in_sp_system_section ] .",
    "for example , it is easier to recognise that one musical chord is the same as another if symbols for the constituent notes are arranged in order of their pitch ( as they normally are in musical notations ) than if there is a haphazard ordering of symbols from one instance of a chord to another . like the different levels in a musical stave , streams of information",
    "provide a means of keeping things in order .",
    "it seems likely that some streams of information will be for relatively concrete attributes like pitch , while others will be for relatively abstract attributes arising from the fact that some symbols may serve as references to other structures , as outlined in sections [ ma_knowledge_section ] and [ references_and_abstractions_section ] .",
    "figure [ parallel_streams_figure ] may give the impression that , in the proposed scheme for representing parallel streams of information , every symbol represents some kind of short event occupying a single time slot . but",
    "in music for example , individual notes vary in their duration and some , such as the drone of a bagpipe , may be held for extended periods .    in the proposed scheme ,",
    "any event that is longer than a single time slot may be represented with a pair of symbols , one marking the start of the event and the other marking when it ends . for example , the symbol ` 10 ' in stream s3 in figure [ parallel_streams_figure ] may be a mark for the beginning of a note , while the symbol ` 11 ' in the same stream may mark when the note ends .",
    "as mentioned in section [ streams_section ] , 2d patterns representing parallel streams of information may contain symbols that serve as references to other structures .",
    "for example , where a portion of music is repeated in different parts of a musical composition , the first instance may be marked with a ` start ' symbol and an ` end ' symbol , and then copies of those two symbols may serve to represent later instances without the need to repeat all the detail .    as outlined in section [ ma_knowledge_section ] , these kinds of linkages between patterns may serve to define classes and subclasses of structure , parts and sub - parts , and several other kinds of knowledge , with seamless integration of different structures .      it is envisaged that 2d patterns representing parallel streams of information will be processed in the same way as other sp patterns : via processes for finding good full and partial matches between patterns and via processes for the building of multiple alignments . as with the processing of 2d patterns representing other kinds of data such as images , it will be necessary to generalise the processes for finding good full and partial matches between patterns and for building multiple alignments so that they work with 2d patterns .",
