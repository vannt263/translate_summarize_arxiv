    "in the adiabatic field ionization regime , the ionization rate grows sharply when the electric field approaches the barrier suppression ( bs ) limit , i.e. when the laser intensity is high enough that the electron in the ground state is able to `` classically '' escape the atomic potential barrier .",
    "the ionization rate for such field strength may become higher than the laser frequency and a regime in which most of the ionization is produced within a single laser half - cycle is achievable .    here",
    "we present a numerical study of some effects of ultrafast ionization in the interaction of a short laser pulse with an initially transparent dense medium .",
    "first , we will discuss the generation of megagauss steady magnetic fields in the surface `` skin '' layer of `` solid '' targets , i.e. slabs of hydrogen atoms with a number density close to that of a solid medium ( macchi et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "second , we will describe effects related to the combination of two - beam interference with ultrafast ionization .",
    "we will show how it is possible to take advantage of this feature to create a layered dielectric - conductor structure able to trap the electric field , as well as a relativistic ionization front ( conejero jarque et al .",
    "the generation of steady currents and magnetic fields by ultrafast ionization is due to the non - adiabatic nature of the response of initially bound electrons to a strongly ramping laser field . using a following `` simple - man s '' model ( smm ) , very similar to the smm used in studies of above - threshold ionization and harmonic generation in atoms",
    ", it can be shown that a single electron subject to an external sinusoidal intense field can acquire a steady velocity ( macchi et al .",
    "1999 )    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the ejection velocity of the electron , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the maximum field amplitude and @xmath4 is the field amplitude at the instant of ionization , which will be close to the threshold field for barrier suppression ( for hydrogen , @xmath5 , being @xmath6 the atomic field unit ) .",
    "if most of the electrons in the medium are ionized at the same instant , as may happen with a pulse which sharply rises above @xmath4 , one gets a net steady current which in turn generates a magnetic field . to obtain a larger current",
    "one may think to `` tune '' appropriately @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is possible if the ionization is no longer correlated with the oscillating field , i.e. , it is produced _ independently _ of the field itself , like in the case studied by wilks et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , in which a steady magnetic field @xmath8 can be obtained in a very dense medium . for intense lasers ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "such a magnetic field would get values exceeding @xmath10 and could explain ( teychenn et al .",
    "1998 ) the experimental observation of high transparency of thin foil solid targets to @xmath11 , @xmath12 pulses ( giulietti et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "however , it is questionable whether this high magnetic field may be obtained with superintense laser pulses . in this case ,",
    "in fact , the `` source pulse '' itself ionizes the medium and thus this will impose a constraint on the phase mismatch between the field and the velocity of the electrons .",
    "we will show by numerical simulations that the steady magnetic field exists but has values around @xmath13 , being therefore too weak to allow enhanced laser propagation .",
    "first we review the results of 1d3v pic simulations with field ionization included .",
    "we choose pulses with a `` @xmath14 '' envelope and with a `` square '' envelope .",
    "for all the pic runs , the laser frequency was @xmath15 , close to that of nd and ti : sapphire lasers .",
    "the thickness of the target was @xmath16 and the density was @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "for the ionization rate we used a semi - empirical formula obtained from atomic physics calculations ( bauer and mulser , 1999 ) .",
    "the laser energy loss due to ionization is included introducing a phenomenological `` polarization '' current ( rae and burnett 1992 , cornolti et al .",
    "1998 , mulser et al . 1998 ) .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the spatial profiles of the magnetic field and the free electron density five cycles after the end of a five cycles long ( @xmath19 ) pulse , for three different field intensities in the `` @xmath14 '' shape case , and for the square profile case at the intermediate intensity value .",
    "the steady field is generated at the beginning of the interaction and is always much weaker than the laser field , even for the most intense case ( corresponding to an intensity of @xmath20 ; its sign varies according to the phase of the laser half cycle where most of the ionization occurs .",
    "the ionization at the left boundary is nearly instantaneous ; however , even if the target is only @xmath21 thick , it is not ionized over its whole thickness due to instantaneous screening , except for the maximum intensity case .",
    "the fact that the produced magnetic field is much less than expected may be attributed to the instantaneous screening of the em wave due to the ultrafast ionization .",
    "in fact , it is too weak to affect self - consistently the refractive index and as a consequence it can not lead to magnetically induced transparency as hypothesized by teychenn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .      to yield a further insight into the magnetic field generated by ultrafast ionization",
    "we look at the results of 1d and 2d boltzmann simulations .",
    "this corresponds to the `` direct '' numerical solution of the boltzmann equation for the electron distribution function @xmath22 , over a phase space grid : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the density of neutral atoms ( supposed at rest for simplicity ) and @xmath25 is the ionization rate .",
    "the term @xmath26 gives the `` instantaneous '' distribution of the just ionized electrons , which is supposed to be known from atomic physics .",
    "a semiclassical picture which allows to define and evaluate @xmath27 was given by cornolti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . with respect to pic simulations ,",
    "the boltzmann approach has the disadvantage of larger memory requirements , but the advantages of reduced numerical noise and the possibility to take into account the full kinetic distribution of the ionized electrons .",
    "we first look at 2d2v boltzmann simulations . we take a @xmath28 , @xmath29 laser pulse impinging on a solid hydrogen target with number density @xmath30 , and thickness @xmath31 .",
    "the time envelope of the laser pulse is gaussian with a fwhm duration of 2 cycles .",
    "the laser spot is also gaussian with a fwhm of @xmath32 .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) shows the magnetic field and the density contours after the end of the laser pulse .",
    "the steady magnetic field has constant ( negative ) sign over its extension .",
    "its maximum intensity is about @xmath33 .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] ( b ) shows the electron current density @xmath34 at the same time of the right plot of fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) .    among the parameters of our simulations",
    ", the magnetic field appears to be most sensitive to the temporal profile of the laser pulse , achieving its maximum value for a square pulse with zero risetime . in fig.[fig4 ] ( a ) we show the results of a 1d boltzmann simulations for a square pulse with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and a target with @xmath37 .",
    "the current density is @xmath38 c.g.s .",
    "units and extends over a distance comparable to @xmath39 .",
    "the maximum magnetic field is consistent with ampere s law , which gives @xmath40 .",
    "assuming a density @xmath41 for the electrons which are instantaneously ionized , one gets a steady velocity @xmath42 .",
    "this value is lower than the ejection velocity for hydrogen @xmath43 .",
    "this suggests that effects such as screening , nonzero ionization time , and velocity statistics act to keep the steady current well below the values that one may estimate according to the smm , eq.([eq : vsteady ] ) .",
    "both laser and target parameters where varied in simulations in order to investigate the scaling of the magnetic field with them . as an example",
    ", fig.[fig4 ] ( b ) shows the results of a simulation for a target of hydrogenic ions with density and thickness identical to fig.[fig4 ] ( a ) , but where we assumed a nuclear charge @xmath44 and scaled the atomic parameters accordingly to @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . in order to have the ionization threshold to be exceeded at the same instant , the laser pulse had the same envelope and frequency but the intensity was scaled by @xmath49 . with respect to the @xmath50 case",
    ", we obtain a steady field with _ lower _ peak amplitude which assumes both positive and negative values .",
    "we also performed 2d boltzmann simulations for a pulse obliquely incident at @xmath51 on the target .",
    "the preliminary results show that the magnetic field is much lower in this case .",
    "therefore it appears that the steady magnetic field is sensitive to the interaction geometry . in any case , the oblique incidence results further confirm the conclusion that no magnetic field capable to affect the transmission through the target is generated .",
    "in this section , we study effects related to two beam - interference in one spatial dimension and for wavelengths in the infrared and optical range . in our numerical experiment , a one - dimensional interference pattern is generated via an appropriate `` target manufacturing '' : the idea is to place a reflecting mirror on the rear side of the target , the one opposite to the laser .",
    "such a mirror might be easily produced by a metallic coating on a glass or plastic target .",
    "taking a laser pulse with peak intensity between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , being @xmath53 the `` threshold '' value for ionization , a plasma is produced in the target bulk around the maxima of interference pattern produced by the incident wave and the wave reflected at the rear mirror .    since in this regime",
    "we deal only with moderate laser intensities , we may use a simple one - dimensional fluid model based on continuity , current and wave equations for an ionizing medium , originally proposed by brunel ( 1990 ) , modified by the inclusion of the polarization current .",
    "more details about the model and its validity can be found in cornolti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and conejero jarque et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we first consider a target with thickness @xmath54 , being @xmath55 , and density @xmath56 .",
    "the laser pulse has a @xmath14-shaped envelope with a duration of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 cycles ) and a peak intensity @xmath59 .",
    "the target parameters are chosen to simulate a thin foil solid slab and it is enough to take the density as low as @xmath60 since the maximum electron density always remains much lower than this value .    the electron density vs. space and time is shown in fig.[fig1_n ] . a clear layered density pattern with a spatial periodicity close to @xmath61 is produced along nearly all the slab .",
    "the layers of overdense plasma are produced near the maxima of the interference pattern .",
    "these maxima appear at close times because of the effect of the smooth envelope of the laser pulse .",
    "the resulting quasi - periodic structure of the refractive index has in principle some similarities with the widely studied semiconductor microcavities and photonic band - gap materials ( see reviews by burstein and weisbuch ( 1993 ) and by skolnick et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ) .",
    "since the density in the plasma layers is overcritical , and the layers are created in a time shorter than a laser halfcycle , the portions of the standing wave between adjacent intensity maxima may be `` trapped '' into the cavity formed by the two neighboring layers .",
    "this trapping effect is best seen in the case of a co@xmath62 pulse impinging over a gas target with @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for this target ,",
    "two plasma layers are produced around the positions @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig3_n ] shows the map of the electric field at early ( a ) and later ( b ) times , showing the generation of the constructive interference pattern which yields the layered ionization ( a ) , and the subsequent trapping of the field which remains in the cavity at times longer than the incident pulse duration ( b ) .",
    "the non - ionized regions between density layers clearly act as optical microcavities .",
    "since the microcavity length is @xmath66 , light must have an upshifted wavevector @xmath67 in order to persist inside the cavity .",
    "this implies also upshift of the laser frequency with @xmath68 as seen in fig.[fig3_n](b ) .",
    "the upshift decreases the critical density value for the trapped radiation and therefore wavelengths much shorter than @xmath69 escape from the cavity . due to the small fraction of light that tunnels out of the cavity one observes radiation emission from the target for a time much longer than the pulse duration .",
    "both the frequency upshift and the pulse lengthening may provide experimental diagnostics for microcavity generation .",
    "the lifetime of the cavities is ultimately limited by processes such as recombination , which however should appear on times much longer than the pulse duration of a few tens of femtoseconds that are considered here and are available in the laboratory .",
    "as already shown , in our model target ionization is produced around the maxima of the `` standing '' wave which is generated due to the reflection at the rear mirror",
    ". however , since ionization is instantaneous on the laser period timescale , it is produced as soon as the wave reflected at the rear mirror travels backwards and builds up the standing wave by interference .",
    "therefore , a backward propagating ionization front is generated , as seen in fig.[fig1_n ] .",
    "the density at the front exceeds the critical density .",
    "this feature is not obtained for a single pulse impinging on a dense target , since it undergoes immediate self - reflection and penetrates only in the `` skin''surface layer ( macchi et al .",
    "an example of `` overdense '' ionization front is obtained in the case of a co@xmath62 square pulse 15 cycles long impinging over a target with @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath71 contour plot is shown in fig.[fig8_n ] .",
    "the ionized layers merge into a more homogeneous distribution and a `` continuous '' ionization front appears .",
    "the merging appears because the time- and space- modulated refractive index perturbs the reflected wave substantially , leading to broadening of interference maxima .",
    "the velocity of the front in fig.[fig8_n ] is near to , or even exceeds at some times that of light .",
    "this is clearly not a physical `` moving mirror '' with a velocity greater than @xmath72 , but a reflective surface which is created apparently with such velocity due to a space - time phase effect .",
