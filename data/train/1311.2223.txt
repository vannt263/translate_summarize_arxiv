    "the controlled production of emulsions composed of micron or submicron - sized drops with a well defined mean size possesses uncountable applications in industry , medicine and pharmacology  @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful methodologies for the production of micro or nano drops consists in generating a thin thread of the fluid to be dispersed within a coflowing stream of the carrier one . under these conditions ,",

    ", the diameter of the feeding tube is usually much larger than that of the produced jet which , therefore , suffers a strong stretching in the downstream direction .",
    "recently ,  @xcite reported experiments on the generation of concentrated monodisperse emulsions composed of drops with _ uniform _ sizes of even below 1 @xmath0 m using a low reynolds number co - flow configuration inspired by the numerical experiments due to  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "a flow rate @xmath1 of a fluid with a viscosity @xmath2 discharges through a cylindrical tube of inner radius @xmath3 into an immiscible liquid of viscosity @xmath4 flowing in parallel with the axis of the injector at a velocity @xmath5 with , from now on , @xmath6 indicating the interfacial tension coefficient between both immiscible liquids and @xmath7 the inner - to - outer viscosity ratio .",
    "the experimental observations of figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] reveal that the inner jet highly stretches downstream provided that the flow - rate ratio @xmath8 is sufficiently small and the capillary number @xmath9 is of order unity or larger .",
    "the approximately cylindrical ligament emitted from the tip of the conical drop breaks under the action of capillary forces , giving rise to a train of droplets with a low size dispersion _ if _",
    "@xmath10 is sufficiently large . under these conditions ,",
    "it was found in  @xcite that the drop diameter scales as @xmath11",
    ". therefore , uniformly - sized drops with arbitrarily small diameters could be , in principle , obtained if the control parameter @xmath12 is set to sufficiently small values and the capillary number @xmath10 is above a so far unknown threshold capillary number @xmath13 , whose determination as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath7 , with @xmath14 , is the main purpose of the present work .",
    ", @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , there exists a critical value of the outer velocity @xmath5 and , consequently , of the capillary number @xmath9 , above which a steady jet issues from the apex of a conical drop and a train of uniform - sized drops is produced ( left column , figures 1a  e ) .",
    "however , if the capillary number is below its critical value , the jet issued at the apex of the cone is unsteady and breaks unevenly , forming drops of different sizes ( right column , figures 1f  j ) .",
    "the values of @xmath10 and @xmath7 in each of the experimental images depicted in this figure are the following : ( a ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 , ( b ) @xmath21 , @xmath22 , ( c ) @xmath16 , @xmath23 , ( d ) @xmath17 , @xmath24 , ( e ) @xmath18 , @xmath25 , ( f ) @xmath19 , @xmath26 , ( g ) @xmath21 , @xmath27 , ( h ) @xmath16 , @xmath28 , ( i ) @xmath17 , @xmath29 , ( j ) @xmath18 , @xmath30 . the outer diameter of the injection tube is @xmath31 @xmath0m.[fig1 ] ]    , which increases from left to right , on the drop formation processes for a fixed value of the viscosity ratio , @xmath19 , and three values of the capillary number , namely , @xmath26 ( top row ) , @xmath27 ( middle row ) and @xmath20 ( bottom row ) .",

    "the outer diameter of the injection tube is @xmath31 @xmath0 m [ fig2 ] ]    to illustrate the effect of the capillary number on the distribution of drop sizes , figure  [ fig1 ] as well as the three movies provided as supplementary material , show how water drops are generated and dispersed within co - flowing streams of different silicon oils with viscosities ranging from @xmath44 cp to @xmath45 cp at @xmath46@xmath47",
    ". figures  [ fig1]a - e reveal that , for each value of the viscosity ratio investigated , there exists a threshold outer velocity @xmath5 above which the thin liquid thread ejected from the tip of a conical drop breaks regularly , forming tiny droplets with very similar diameters . in the experimental situations depicted in figures  [ fig1]f - j , the overall geometry of the drop attached at the injection tube is similar to that showed in figures  [ fig1]a - e , but the jet issued at the apex of the cone is unsteady and breaks unevenly , forming droplets with a broad size distribution .",
    "it is interesting to note that the cone itself is steady even in cases in which the drop formation process is not periodic .",
    "the reason for the differences observed in the two series of experiments depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] is that , in figures  [ fig1]a - e @xmath48 , whereas @xmath49 in figures  [ fig1]f - j , where @xmath13 is defined as the minimum value of the capillary number for which a train of uniform - sized drops is produced for fixed values of @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , in contrast with the noticeable dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath7 deduced from the analysis of the type of experimental images depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] , the results in figure  [ fig2 ] reveal that the critical capillary number is rather insensitive to changes in @xmath12 .",
    "since many different applications such as drug delivery demand that the size distribution of the drops composing the emulsion is as narrow as possible , it is desirable that the capillary number at which the coflow device is operated is larger than @xmath13 .",
    "it is thus our purpose in this paper to develop a theory to quantify and explain why drops with uniform sizes are produced only for values of the capillary number above the critical value @xmath13 deduced from the analysis of the experimental images in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "notice that , according to the experimental observations in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] , figure  [ fig3 ] shows that @xmath13 is a decreasing function of @xmath7 which does not appreciably vary with @xmath12 .    as a first attempt to predict and quantify the dependence of the critical capillary number on @xmath7 depicted in figure  [ fig3 ] , let us recall that the non - regularity in the drop formation process is associated with the fact that the thin liquid thread from which drops are emitted , is itself unsteady .",
    "this experimental evidence suggests that the unstable capillary perturbations that give rise to the generation of drops can not be convected downstream at a sufficiently large speed when @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the two regimes delimited by the experimental data points in figure  [ fig3 ] should correspond to those conditions for which unstable perturbations are either convected downstream the cone tip ( convectively unstable flow ) , or are able to propagate upstream , thus inhibiting the formation of a steady jet ( absolutely unstable flow ) .",
    ", as a function of the viscosity ratio @xmath7 .",
    "symbols show the experimental transition points separating the monodisperse ( @xmath48 , figures 1a  e ) , and polydisperse ( @xmath49 , figures 1f  j ) droplet generation regimes .",
    "the line shows the critical capillary number for the transition from convective to absolute instability computed using tomotika s dispersion relation .",
    "[ fig3],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    previous studies  @xcite have demonstrated that the experimentally observed transition from jetting to dripping in cylindrical capillary jets can be predicted by means of a _ local _ linear stability analysis of parallel streams  @xcite .",
    "thus , with the purpose of calculating the boundary separating the two different drop formation processes depicted in figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and in the movies provided as supplementary material , we have determined the values of the capillary number for which the temporal growth rate of the perturbations with zero group velocity is also equal to zero .",
    "the result obtained using tomotika s dispersion relation  @xcite , which describes the growth and propagation of perturbations in a cylindrical jet immersed into another immiscible liquid , is represented together with the experimental data in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "although the conditions of validity of tomotika s analysis are fulfilled at large distances from the injector , where the diameter of the liquid jet is nearly constant , figure  [ fig3 ] reveals that the parallel flow stability analysis predicts larger values for the critical capillary number than those measured experimentally .",
    "consequently , the full jet , which strongly stretches in the downstream direction , is more stable than the cylindrical portion located far downstream .    to improve the agreement with experimental results , in this study we have performed a",
    "_ global stability analysis _ that takes into account the real shape of the stretched jet and describes the growth and propagation of perturbations without resorting to the parallel flow simplification used in previous studies  @xcite . to avoid the lengthy numerical computations associated with a global stability analysis in two or three spatial directions  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the present work we have developed a one - dimensional model based on slender - body theory that yields a single partial differential equation governing the spatiotemporal evolution of the jet radius . in @xcite it was shown that the axial variations of both the steady shape of the jet and the outer flow field are very well reproduced by our previous theory . here we will demonstrate that our global stability analysis , that resorts to a new equation for the jet radius , faithfully reproduces tomotika s dispersion relation in the long wave limit for the case of cylindrical jets of small viscosity ratio .",
    "moreover , the experimentally measured values of the critical capillary number are very well reproduced since our final equation retains the axial dependence of the flow field in the formulation .",
    "let us point out that the global stability analysis , developed in  2.2 , shares many similarities with that by  @xcite , where the global stability of gravitationally stretched jets is studied using a different one - dimensional model and excellent agreement with experiments is found .",
    "one of the possible ways to analyze the conditions under which drops are formed regularly from the tip of the conical drop , would be to solve the unsteady velocity field using the integral formulation due to @xcite , as was done in  @xcite .",
    "however , following a strategy similar to that successfully applied to the case of liquid jets in air by @xcite , the dynamics of the low reynolds number jets depicted in figures 1 - 2 can be described using a much simpler one - dimensional approach which reveals the physics underlying the transition observed in these figures in a neat way . the central idea behind our one - dimensional theory",
    "can be understood by noticing that the slender jets shown in figures 1 - 2 resemble the case of drops immersed in a purely straining flow @xcite .",
    "the deformation of slender drops immersed in this type of flow field has been rigorously analyzed using asymptotic methods by @xcite and , from these studies , it is learned that the outer flow field in the case of low viscous drops can be decomposed , in a first approximation , as the addition of the unperturbed flow field plus a distribution of sources located at the axis of symmetry . since , in our case , the capillary that confines the outer fluid is ten times larger than the inner one , the dynamics of the jet is not affected by this confinement , as already demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the conclusions derived from @xcite are fully applicable to the situation at hand , and figure 4 sketches the key idea under which our theory is built .",
    "this figure shows that the outer velocity field can be decomposed , in a first approximation , as the addition of two simpler flow fields : the unperturbed velocity field , which is the one that would exist in the coflowing device _ if the inner fluid was not injected _ ( see figure [ exterior]a ) and that induced on the outer stream by the presence of the jet ( see [ exterior]b ) , which can be viewed as a perturbation to the former . from now on , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "will indicate time and the radial and axial coordinates respectively , with @xmath53 located at the exit of the injection tube , whereas @xmath54 will denote the radius of the jet . in our approach ,",
    "the unperturbed velocity field is calculated numerically , by solving the navier - stokes equations in the zero reynolds number limit ( stokes equations ) subjected to the appropriate boundary conditions , as it will be explained below . regarding the perturbed flow , we will take advantage of the fact that the outer velocity field induced by a slender jet of a low viscosity fluid immersed in an outer axisymmetric flow , as is the case of the experiments shown in figures 1 and 2 , can be approximated to that created by a line of sources located at the axis of symmetry @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the source distribution , @xmath55 , must be such that the kinematic boundary condition is verified at the jet interface ( see figure [ exterior]b ) .    the representation of the outer flow field as the addition of two simpler velocity fields greatly facilitates the theoretical analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of the jet .",
    "firstly , notice that the numerical computation of the unperturbed flow field sketched in figure [ exterior]a is straightforward since this solution does not depend on @xmath56 , @xmath7 or @xmath12 : it is just a function of the geometry of the coflowing device and thus , it is unique for a given injector .",
    "but , what s more , notice that the unperturbed velocity field does not even need to be known everywhere in the flow domain ; instead , for our purposes , an accurate representation of the flow field in the vicinity of the axis of symmetry is enough .",
    "this is due to the fact that our interest here is to deduce an equation for @xmath57 , with @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "since the jet radius is located very near the axis of symmetry in most of the flow domain , all the information needed from the numerics to build our theoretical approach are just two functions : the axial component of the velocity at the axis , @xmath60 , as well as @xmath61 , where the subscript @xmath62 will be used in the following to denote quantities related to the unperturbed problem .",
    "indeed , given these two functions , the analytical expression of the axial component of the unperturbed velocity field in the near - axis region will be expressed in taylor series as @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the corresponding approximate expressions of both the radial component of the unperturbed velocity field namely , @xmath64 and of the unperturbed pressure field , @xmath65 , will be written in terms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 making use of the equations of continuity and momentum , as it will be shown below .",
    "let us point out that the main difference between this work and those by @xcite , where the deformation of drops and bubbles immersed in a purely straining flow in the limit of negligible inertial effects is studied , is that our theory retains the effect of the real outer flow field on the spatiotemporal evolution of the jet .",
    "more precisely , the effect of the injector geometry on the outer flow field will be represented in the equation to be deduced for @xmath54 through the two numerically determined functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 which , for the case of the specific geometry used in the experiments explained above , are represented graphically in figure [ uaxis ] ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us point out that the theory to be developed in  2.1 can be extended to any other types of axisymmetric geometries provided that the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 are straightforwardly determined from the numerical solution of the stokes equations subjected to the no slip boundary conditions imposed by the geometry of the injector and to the corresponding inflow / outflow boundary conditions .     located at the axis of symmetry . ]",

    "moreover , poiseuille velocity profiles are imposed at the upstream and downstream boundaries of the flow domain ( see @xcite for further details ) . regarding the perturbed flow , it was demonstrated by @xcite that , when a slender drop or bubble with a viscosity much smaller than that of the outer fluid ( @xmath77 ) is immersed within a straining flow , the first order modification to the unperturbed outer velocity field can be expressed as a superposition of sources located at the axis of symmetry .",

    "it is of interest to point out that the flow within the jet in our one - dimensional theoretical approach may exhibit a recirculation bubble , in contrast with the type of one dimensional models which assume that the velocity profile within the jet is uniform ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , a recirculation bubble could exist in our case if the negative velocities of the parabolic velocity profile associated with an adverse inner pressure gradient ( @xmath97 ) , were larger in magnitude than the corresponding positive velocity of the plug flow velocity profile .    in ( [ continuidad ] ) ,",

    "both families are also differentiated by the fact that , contrarily to the case of the non - oscillatory mode , the amplitude of the oscillatory eigenfunction is virtually zero in the cone region , as it can be deduced from figure  [ fig4 ] . at this point ,",
    "let us anticipate that , within the ranges of @xmath7 and @xmath12 explored in this study , the stability analysis predicts that the oscillatory mode dominates over the steady one , so it is reasonable to expect that the shape of the eigenfunction depicted in figure  [ fig4]f is somehow related with our experimental observations .",
    "this is indeed the case since , as revealed by figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] , the cone region is unperturbed even in the cases in which the drop formation process is not periodic ( see also the movies provided as supplementary material ) .",
    "moreover , the maximum amplitude of the eigenfunction associated with the oscillatory mode is located slightly downstream the cone tip , and this is consistent with the experimental observation that the aperiodic formation process is associated with an unsteady emission of drops from a region located very close to the cone apex .",
    "our global stability analysis also reveals that the value of the critical capillary number is hardly dependent on @xmath12 for values of the viscosity ratio @xmath160 ( see figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this finding is also in agreement with the experimental evidence shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , where it can be appreciated that @xmath13 is rather insensitive to changes in @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , in view of the slight variation of @xmath13 with @xmath12 shown in figure  [ fig6 ] , the dependence of the critical capillary number with @xmath7 is calculated for a fixed value of @xmath154 .",

    "we would like to emphasize that our analysis is able to predict the transition from the regular drop formation process that takes place when a thin steady ligament is issued from the cone apex ( jetting regime ) to the regime in which droplets detach aperiodically at the cone - jet region ( dripping regime ) , but not the reverse dripping to jetting transition .",
    "note also that the destabilization of the regular drop formation regime observed in our experiments shares some similarities with the transition from jetting to dripping observed in liquid jets stretched by gravity  @xcite , where the dripping regime manifests itself by the formation of drops right from or slightly downstream the exit of the injection tube .",
    "the main difference with the gravitational case is that , in the physical situation analyzed here , dripping occurs right from the tip of the conical drop , whose global shape is stable except very close to the microdrop emission region .",
    "the local oscillations appearing at the tip explain why the emission process is not periodic and leads to the formation of unevenly sized drops when the flow is globally unstable ( see figures 1f - j , 6f and the movies provided as supplementary material ) .",
    "let us point out that we also observe the formation of drops right from the exit tube , but this regime is found for values of the capillary number notably smaller than those investigated here @xcite .",
    "this type of dripping regime , which is much more similar to that observed in the gravitational case , has not been reported here since the diameters of the drops obtained are imposed by the geometry of the injector and , thus , are not of interest for applications due to the fact that their sizes are of the order of 100 microns or even larger .",

    "however , we will show below that , although the jet is indeed stabilized thanks to this kinematic mechanism , the main reason for the higher stability exhibited by the stretched microjets of figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] is in fact related with the gradient of capillary pressure .",
    "indeed , let us adopt the slender approximation of assuming that the wavelength of the perturbation , @xmath163 , with @xmath164 the wavenumber , is much smaller than the length along which @xmath152 experiences variations of its same order of magnitude .",
    "this condition , clearly verified for @xmath165 , permits to look for traveling - wave solutions to equation  , of the form @xmath166 , with @xmath167 and @xmath168 slowly varying functions of @xmath123 . at leading order",

    "the resulting dispersion relation   in the limit @xmath171 is identical to tomotika s long wave limit dispersion relation deduced by  @xcite , a fact constituting a further proof of our theory .",
    "applying the zero group velocity condition @xmath174 , @xmath159 to equation   in the limit @xmath171 , the boundary separating the absolutely and convectively unstable states can be calculated as explained in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting a / c transition curve , shown in figure  [ fig7 ] ( dash - dotted line ) , is very close to that obtained from the much more involved calculation  @xcite that makes use of tomotika s dispersion relation ( dotted line ) .",
    "however , as stated above , to understand the higher stability of stretched jets we must retain the _ non - parallel _ terms in the dispersion relation   associated with axial variations of @xmath152 and @xmath110 .",
    "the main effect of non - parallel terms is to decrease the real part of @xmath175 , namely , the growth rate of perturbations .",
    "indeed , @xmath176 since @xmath177 ( see figure [ uaxis ] ) and @xmath178 ( see figure  [ fig8 ] ) . it was already pointed out above that positive axial velocity gradients stabilize the jet  @xcite , but figure  [ fig8 ] reveals that @xmath179 near the tip of the conical drop , whose steady shape is depicted in figure 6b .",
    "the reason why the non - parallel term @xmath180 contributes to the stabilization of the stretched jet can be easily explained as follows : the gradients of capillary pressure in   produce an axial variation of the flow rate per unit length given by @xmath181 . using the slender approximation for the curvature , namely , @xmath182 , linearizing the resulting expression around @xmath183 , and using dimensionless variables , yields @xmath184 which , as can be appreciated in figure  [ fig8 ] , is an excellent approximation to @xmath180 in the cone - jet transition region .",

    "@xmath191 ) by virtue of the mass balance  , thus explaining the stabilizing effect of the gradient of capillary pressure existing inside stretched jets .     and @xmath192 that the function @xmath180 in   ( dashed line ) can be well approximated as @xmath193 ( solid line ) , and that @xmath194 ( dotted line ) , is smaller that @xmath180 , meaning that the stabilization mechanism associated with the action of capillary forces on highly curved interfaces , dominates over the kinematic stabilization produced by the elongation of fluid particles  @xcite .",

    "in this paper we study the effect of the capillary number on the size distribution of the drops composing the microemulsions obtained when two immiscible liquid streams with @xmath14 co - flow at low reynolds numbers and highly stretched liquid threads are produced  @xcite .",
    "our experiments reveal that , when @xmath195 and the flow rate ratio is such that @xmath196 , a liquid jet with a diameter substantially smaller than that of the injection tube is issued from the tip of a conical drop pinned at the exit of the injector .",
    "we find that this ligament is unsteady and breaks into unevenly sized droplets for @xmath197 with @xmath198 the critical capillary number and that , thanks to the fact that the growing capillary perturbations are convected downstream the cone - jet transition region , the thin liquid jet is steady and breaks into uniformly sized drops when @xmath199 . with the purpose of predicting the dependence of the critical capillary number on @xmath7 , we have first determined the values of @xmath10 for which the group velocity of neutral waves is zero under the parallel flow assumption .",
    "the results of this analysis using the dispersion relation which describes the growth of capillary perturbations in cylindrical capillary jets  @xcite , reveal that the boundary separating the absolutely unstable region from the convectively unstable one  @xcite is well above the experimental values of the critical capillary number , a fact indicating that the non - cylindrical liquid ligaments of our experiments are more stable than their cylindrical counterparts .",
    "thus , to improve the agreement between experiments and theory , we have performed a global stability analysis retaining the highly stretched shape of the liquid jet as well as realistic inner and outer velocity fields .",
    "for that purpose , following the slender body theory developed in  @xcite , we have deduced the partial differential equation   that describes the spatiotemporal evolution of the jet radius and whose steady limit accurately reproduces the shape of the unperturbed liquid ligaments .",
    "also , we have shown here that our equation   is able to reproduce tomotika s stability analysis in the limit of cylindrical jets of a low viscosity fluid , a fact that further supports the validity of our theory . moreover , the results of our stability analysis , which are in fair agreement with experimental measurements , indicate that the regime in which monodisperse emulsions are produced corresponds to those values of the capillary number for which the cone - jet system is _ globally stable_. we can thus conclude that the gradients of interfacial curvature and of axial velocity play an essential role in the propagation of perturbations along stretched capillary jets . notice that this idea has also been successfully applied to describe the jetting to dripping transition experienced by gravitationally stretched capillary jets using the one - dimensional equations for the jet radius and the axial velocity  @xcite .",
    "let us point out that the simplicity of the one dimensional approximation used here to study the stability of stretched jets contrasts with the difficulty of analyzing the stability of two dimensional or three dimensional free surface flows ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of our major findings here is the discovery of a new stabilization mechanism that resorts to the existence of capillary pressure gradients inside low reynolds number stretched jets that differs from the one based on the elongation of fluid particles  @xcite . to conclude",
    ", we would like to emphasize that equation   is rather general in the sense that it can be applied to describe the propagation and growth of capillary perturbations along the jets produced , for instance , in flow - focusing devices operated at low reynolds numbers . indeed , notice that the influence of each particular geometry in the equation for the jet radius   comes through the functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which can be easily found numerically by solving stokes equations subjected to the appropriate boundary conditions when the inner fluid is removed from the flow domain .",
    "currently , we are extending the idea of decomposing the flow field as the addition of two simpler velocity fields to those cases in which the reynolds number of the outer stream is large .",
    "the same type of ideas based on the slender body approach could also be applied to describe the stability of electrohydrodynamic tip streaming regimes that , under appropriate conditions , take place when electrical stresses act on the interface of liquid threads with a cone - jet structure @xcite .",
