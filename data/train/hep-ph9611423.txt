    "currently there are three pieces of evidence which suggest that neutrinos have non - zero mass differences and mixings .",
    "these are : ( i ) the observations of solar neutrinos , ( ii ) the anomaly in the @xmath0 ratio in atmospheric neutrinos at low energies and ( iii ) the possible @xmath1 conversion seen in the lsnd experiment . with the conventional interpretation of these effects as being due to neutrino oscillations ;",
    "the solar neutrino anomaly needs a @xmath2 @xmath3 of either about @xmath4 ( msw ) or about @xmath5 ( long wavelength vacuum oscillations ) , the atmospheric neutrino anomaly calls for a @xmath2 @xmath6 or @xmath7 of @xmath8 and the lsnd effect needs a @xmath2 @xmath6 in the neighborhood of @xmath9 . for these three independent @xmath2",
    "s at least one more neutrino state ( beyond the three flavors ) is necessary @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we explore the possibility that all the neutrino anomalies may yet be accounted for with just three flavors of neutrinos .",
    "we assume only two distinct values of @xmath2 s . one value of @xmath2 is selected to explain the low energy atmospheric data , while the second value is selected with the lsnd effect in mind .",
    "specifically we choose the following spectrum of @xmath2 s : @xmath10 @xmath11 we then seek to determine if , with this spectrum of @xmath2 s , an explanation of the lsnd , solar , atmospheric neutrino data can be found by appropriate choice of neutrino mixing angles .",
    "we begin by calculating the neutrino survival and transition probabilities . in general , these are given by @xmath12 here the @xmath13 are elements of the matrix @xmath14 describing the mixing between the flavor eigenstates ( @xmath15 ) and the mass eigenstates ( @xmath16 ) ; that is @xmath17 .",
    "for now we ignore possible cp violation , then @xmath14 is real , and eq ( [ genprob ] ) may be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the distance between the neutrino source and detection .",
    "we present below an explicit form of the @xmath21 matrix @xmath14 @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , _ etc._. the explicit form of the transition probabilities depends on the spectrum of the @xmath2 s . for the choice of @xmath2 s considered here , all of the oscillating terms in eq ( [ bprob ] ) average to zero for the energies and path lengths relevant to both low energy atmospheric and solar neutrinos . hence , for our model , the form of the transition and survival probabilities relevant to solar and atmospheric neutrinos are : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 note that the above expressions are functions of the mixing angles only , and are independent of the neutrino energy .",
    "the four currently operating solar neutrino experiments report the following results :    [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     recently measurements of the reaction @xmath28 have been made@xcite .",
    "these suggest that the cross - section for the inverse reaction @xmath29 at energies relevant for the solar core may be somewhat smaller than the value used in the standard solar model(ssm ) of bahcall et al .",
    "hence it is possible that the flux of @xmath30 neutrinos is somewhat smaller than the ssm , while the other neutrino fluxes are unaffected .",
    "we allow for this possibility by defining @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34 neutrino flux predicted in the ssm of bahcall and pinsonneault , which incorporates helium diffusion@xcite .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath31 describes the deviation of the actual @xmath34 neutrino flux from the ssm value .",
    "we can now proceed to describe the expected counting rates at the various solar neutrino experiments in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath35 the solar @xmath36 survival probability .    with a threshold energy of 7.5 mev",
    "the kamiokande water cerenkov detector is sensitive only to @xmath34 neutrinos .",
    "the expected flux is given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ssm prediction and @xmath39 ( approximately 0.16 ) is the ratio of the @xmath40 to @xmath41 scattering cross sections integrated over the @xmath34 neutrino spectrum .",
    "note that we have ignored the possibility of oscillation into sterile flavors and assumed that solar neutrinos not interacting as @xmath36 s interact as either @xmath42 s or @xmath43 s with probability @xmath44 .",
    "the expected counting rate in the homestake @xmath45 experiment is given by @xmath46 where 6.2 snu s is the expected contribution from @xmath34 neutrinos and 1.8 snu s is the contribution from all other solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "similarly , the expected counting rate in the @xmath47 experiments sage and gallex is given by @xmath48 where 13.8 snu s is the expected contribution from @xmath34 neutrinos and 117.6 snu s is the contribution from all other solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "the results of a chi - squared analysis are shown in fig .",
    "we find that there is a solution at the 90% c.l .",
    "when the electron neutrino survival probability is in the range @xmath49 and the @xmath34 neutrino flux is in the range @xmath50 . and mixing as atmospheric neutrinos and hence should show an energy independent suppression .",
    "a search for an energy independent fit with varying @xmath51 was made in ref .",
    "] this is consistent with the variation in @xmath34 neutrino flux found in an analysis of solar models@xcite .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "1 can be interpreted in terms of the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath14 . from eq ( [ pee ] )",
    "the @xmath36 survival probability @xmath35 is a function of @xmath52 and @xmath53 only .",
    "each allowed value of @xmath51 in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to an allowed range of @xmath35 and hence to an allowed range of @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "2 we present a plot of the allowed values ( 90% c.l . ) of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 . at @xmath56 ,",
    "@xmath35 is required to be @xmath58 , this can be realized only in three flavor mixing .",
    "hence , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 must both be nonzero . at @xmath57",
    ", @xmath35 can be greater then 0.5 , which can be accomplished in effective two flavor mixing . as shown in the figure ,",
    "there are allowed regions with @xmath54 or @xmath55 equal to zero , corresponding to pure @xmath61 or @xmath62 mixing respectively .",
    "the liquid scintillation neutrino detector ( lsnd ) experiment at los alamos reports to have observed the possible appearance of @xmath63 in an initial beam of @xmath64 s @xcite .",
    "these results have been interpreted as evidence of neutrino oscillations and the preferred range of @xmath2 and @xmath65 in a two flavor mixing scenario given . for definiteness , we choose @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which lie in this range @xcite .    in the range of @xmath68 covered by the lsnd set - up , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "then the @xmath71 conversion probability is given by @xmath72 thus the three - flavor interpretation of the lsnd result is obtained by letting @xmath73 this may be expressed as a constraint on the three flavor mixing angles . using @xmath74    choosing @xmath75 to be near @xmath76 ,",
    "the lsnd results then give @xmath77 , and we have @xmath78    in order to determine the range of validity of this result , constraints from reactor and accelerator experiments must be taken into consideration .",
    "for this range of @xmath2 , reactor experiments give the bound@xcite : @xmath79 and accelerator experiments give the bound@xcite : @xmath80 as @xmath81 is related to @xmath82 through eq ( [ lsnd ] ) these two upper limits can be combined to form bounds on the allowed values of @xmath83 and @xmath81 .",
    "we have : @xmath84 and @xmath85 hence the requirement that the lsnd results be consistent with existing bounds on neutrino mixing leads to rather stringent limits on the allowed values of @xmath83 and @xmath81 .",
    "we will find these constraints particularly useful when interpreting the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "experimentally measured atmospheric neutrino fluxes are often described in terms of an ( observed to predicted ) ratio of ratios @xmath86 , where @xmath87 the final results @xcite from kamiokande for the low energy atmospheric neutrino @xmath0 ratio place @xmath86 at @xmath88 .",
    "the results from imb @xcite are in excellent agreement with these results .",
    "results from non - water - cerenkov detectors are somewhat varying : soudan @xcite finds an r of @xmath89 whereas the results from nusex @xcite and frejus @xcite are consistent with an r of unity , although with smaller statistics than the two large water - cerenkov detectors .",
    "it has been known for some time that this low energy atmospheric neutrino anomaly can be explained by neutrino oscillations . for @xmath2 in the range",
    "@xmath90 it has been shown @xcite that this anomaly can be explained by @xmath91 oscillations for @xmath92 or by @xmath93 oscillations for @xmath94 expressing these bounds in terms of the @xmath13 we have : @xmath95 for @xmath91 oscillations and @xmath96 for @xmath93 oscillations .    in the narrow range of @xmath83 values permitted by lsnd ,",
    "reactor and accelerator data ( eq [ limits ] ) @xmath97 is less then 0.05 and thus inconsistent with eq ( [ pmto ] ) ; while @xmath98 can take on values up to 0.48 .",
    "hence , in this region , the atmospheric neutrino anomaly must be explained almost exclusively by @xmath93 mixing .    with @xmath99 constrained in terms of @xmath53 by eq ( [ lsnd ] ) and @xmath55 bound by eq ( [ limits ] )",
    ", we find that @xmath100 if @xmath54 is in the range : @xmath101 thus we can express this explanation of the low energy atmospheric neutrino anomaly consistent with the lsnd , reactor , accelerator data as the region of the @xmath102 plane bounded by eq ( [ lsnd ] ) and eq ( [ limits ] ) .",
    "it is now a straightforward matter to identify simultaneous solutions to the solar , atmospheric and lsnd neutrino data . as the energy independent solution to the solar neutrino problem , shown in fig . 2 , and the combined lsnd and atmospheric neutrino solution are both expressed as regions of the @xmath102 plane , any intersection between the allowed regions represents the desired solution .",
    "3 presents a plot of the intersecting regions of the solar neutrino and atmospheric - lsnd solutions .",
    "3a assumes the @xmath30 solar neutrino flux , @xmath31 , is at 80% of its ssm value , fig .",
    "3b assumes @xmath31 is at 70% of its ssm value and fig .",

    "3a and narrow region of overlap in fig .",
    "3b broadening somewhat in fig .",
    "3c as the @xmath30 neutrino suppression is allowed to increase to 0.65 .",
    "it should be noted that the selection of any region of the @xmath102 plane determines the complete set of mixing angles , and hence the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath14 , as @xmath103 is fixed by eq ( [ lsnd ] ) .",
    "specifically the intersection region of fig .",
    "3b corresponds to @xmath54 @xmath104 0.707 , @xmath55 @xmath104 0.140 and @xmath103 @xmath104 0.125 .    using eq ( [ mat ] ) we present below the explicit form of the @xmath21 mixing matrix @xmath14 corresponding to solution region of fig .",

    "the suppression in @xmath107 scattering should be in the range 0.38 - 0.40 of ssm at all energies and in @xmath108 , charged current suppression should be about @xmath109 .    *",

    "we thus expect 0.56 to 0.58 of the ssm rate , and an identical suppression should hold for the pep line .",
    "* ( iii ) * the atmospheric @xmath113 anomaly should be confirmed by super - kamiokande .",
    "zenith angle dependence of multi - gev neutrinos should confirm the tentative evidence seen in kamiokande @xcite .",
    "but most important is our prediction @xcite that @xmath114 oscillations should be confirmed by observation of excess high energy e - like upcoming shower events ( above and beyond @xmath115 neutral current events ) .    *",
    "( iv ) * future reactor experiments such as chooz @xcite and palo verde @xcite which will be sensitive to @xmath2 upto @xmath116 should see a @xmath63 survival probability of @xmath117 .    *",

    "we predict , at @xmath121 , an effective @xmath65 of @xmath122 which is 0.06 .    *",
    "( vii ) * large mixings in some ranges of @xmath2 lead to strong conversion of @xmath64 to @xmath123 due to the msw effect in supernova , leading to a harder energy spectrum of the emerging @xmath124 s .",
    "this can lead to potential conflict with observation of neutrinos from sn1987a . for the @xmath2 in our scenario",
    "this is not a problem @xcite .    *",
    "( viii ) * the neutrino mass spectrum implied by our scenario is : @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "there are two limiting cases of interest assuming that the largest mass is in the @xmath127 range .",
    "one is the hierarchical limit , in which @xmath128 is negligible",
    ". then @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the other is the nearly degenerate limit , in which @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "then , the sum of the neutrino masses is @xmath133 . in this case , the cosmological density parameter associated with neutrinos @xmath134 ( for h of about 0.5 ) and the amount of neutrino dark matter component along with cold dark matter makes for a viable and testable scenario for mixed dark matter @xcite .    *",
    "( ix ) * when the neutrinos are majorana particles , the effective mass @xmath135 relevant in neutrino - less double @xmath112-decay analysis is @xmath136 we find that in the case of the hierarchical spectrum @xmath137 whereas in the degenerate case @xmath138 ( this could be somewhat smaller when cp phases are taken into account ) .",
    "it is interesting that these values are in the range of what the double beta decay experiments can probe now and in the near future @xcite .",
    "* ( x ) * when the mixing matrix is allowed to have a cp violating phase , the cp violating neutrino flavor conversion probability differences are given by @xcite    @xmath139\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath140   \\nonumber\\\\ = |u_{\\mu 2}||u_{\\tau 2}||u_{\\mu 3}||u_{\\tau 3}|\\sin \\phi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath141 with @xmath142 being the phase in the mixing matrix . with the matrix of eq .

    "hence , @xmath148 can be as large as 0.07.(for these parameters , matter effects are negligible @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude by stressing that our proposal to account for both solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies by the same mass and mixing can be confirmed or ruled out in the very near future .",
