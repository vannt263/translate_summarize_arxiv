    "for a long time it has been believed that electromagnetic polarizabilities may be calculated using the quantum mechanical relations @xmath0 recently , it has been shown that these relations contain large uncertainties , especially in the @xmath1 dependent retardation term which is compensated by other relativistic terms of the same order @xcite .",
    "problems of an other kind are experienced when applying chiral perturbation theory .",
    "agreement with experimental data is obtained when the calculation is restricted to the leading order .",
    "then the following relation is obtained @xcite @xmath2 however , the unavoidable inclusion of the @xmath3 degree of freedom removes the agreement @xcite .",
    "the two approaches also have in common that only a limited selection of degrees of freedom is taken into account and that it is difficult to identify degrees of freedom which are possibly missing .",
    "this problem is solved by applying the nonsubtracted dispersion theory , starting with the following consideration : in the extreme forward ( @xmath4 ) and extreme backward ( @xmath5 ) direction the amplitudes for compton scattering may be written in the form @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 correspond to the case where the initial - state and final - state photons have parallel linear polarizations and @xmath8 to the case where these photons have perpendicular linear polarizations .",

    "it tentatively has been suggested that the @xmath28 meson is the relevant particle which couples to two photons with parallel polarization .",
    "this suggestion implies that the @xmath28 meson degree of freedom makes the most important contribution to @xmath29 and , therefore , is responsible for the diamagnetism and the enhancement of the electric polarizability @xmath13 over the s - channel prediction .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     a new precise determination of the polarizability difference for the proton @xmath37 has been performed using the taps apparatus at photon energies below pion threshold @xcite . at these energies",
    "the contribution of the backward spin - polarizability @xmath38 to the scattering amplitude is small so that @xmath37 can be extracted from the data without mayor model dependencies .",
    "the result obtained is @xmath39 to be compared with @xmath40 obtained from photon absorption data through the baldin sum rule @xcite . a corresponding experiment for the neutron",
    "is extremely difficult , because there is no thomson amplitude to interfere with the non - born part of the scattering amplitude what provides the largest contribution to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 dependent part of the differential cross section in case of the proton .",
    "nevertheless , compton scattering by the neutron at energies below @xmath24 threshold has successfully been carried out and has led to a first result for @xmath41 with a meaningful precision @xcite .    because of the difficulties mentioned above it has been proposed @xcite to measure quasi - free compton scattering by the neutron at energies between pion threshold and the @xmath3 peak to determine @xmath42 .",
    "this is possible with high precision because free and quasi - free compton scattering experiments by the proton have shown , that the prediction of the theory of quasi - free reactions is valid @xcite .",
    "also , the prediction of dispersion theory for the backward spin polarizability of the proton proved to be valid @xcite .",
    "therefore , the corresponding prediction for the neutron , @xmath43 @xmath44 , may be applied to evaluate quasi - free compton scattering by the neutron .",
    "recent investigations @xcite have been carried out with the mainz 64 cm @xmath45 @xmath46 48 cm nai(tl ) detector operating in coincidence with the gttingen segmented recoil detector seneca by using deuterium and hydrogen targets .",
    "since quasi - free events from the proton and neutron are registered simultaneously and are discriminated through a thin plastic scintillator layer in front of seneca further tests of the experimental method were possible by evaluating the quasi - free proton data in the same way as the neutron data and comparing the results with the corresponding free - proton data .",
    "the result obtained for the polarizability difference of the neutron is @xcite @xmath47 to be compared with @xmath48 obtained from the photoabsorption cross section @xcite .",
    "a summary of our recent experimental results is given in table 1 .",
    "it should be noted that the number given for @xmath49 is the first experimental result obtained for this quantity , which appears to be slightly larger than the previous sum - rule prediction @xcite .",
    "the present result for @xmath50 is in agreement with the result of an experiment on electromagnetic scattering of neutrons in a coulomb field @xcite .",
    "a difference , however , of the two methods is that quasi - free compton scattering is well tested through experiments on the proton whereas electromagnetic scattering may have large uncertainties @xcite .",
