    "it is generally thought that inside an observational universe , a phase of the slow - roll inflation and reheating is required , which will set the initial condition of the  big bang \" evolution , i.e. a homogeneous hot universe with the scale - invariant primordial perturbation .    in principle",
    ", the slow - roll inflation should occur in a high energy scale , which is required to insure that the amplitude of primordial density perturbation is consistent with the observations and as well as after the inflation , the reheating temperature could be suitable for a hot  big bang \" evolution . in this sense",
    ", it seems that the energy scale of the eternal inflation should be enough high , or the spawning of observational universe will be island - like , which is exponentially unfavored , since it requires a large upward tunneling , e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite",
    ".    however , the observational universe might classically emerge from a background with low energy scale , e.g. the emergent universe scenario @xcite . in the emergent universe scenario ,",
    "the universe originates from a static state in the infinite past , when the universe emerges , or begins to deviate from this static state , it is slowly expanding . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was for the first time observed that the scale - invariant curvature perturbation might be adiabatically generated during the slow expansion of primordial universe , also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus the initial conditions of the  big bang \" evolution may be set after this slowly expanding phase ends . during the slow expansion @xcite,@xcite",
    ", the null energy condition is violated , which might imply that the corresponding evolution suffers from the ghost instability .",
    "recently , the application of galileon @xcite , or its nontrivial generalization , e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , to the early universe has acquired increasing attentions , e.g. see @xcite for bouncing universe , and @xcite,@xcite for galilean genesis , in which the violation of null energy condition can be implemented stably , there is not the ghost instability , and see also earlier work about the ghost condensate @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was showed by applying the generalized galileon that the scale invariant curvature perturbation may be adiabatically generated in slowly expanding galilean genesis phase .",
    "here , inspired by @xcite , we would like to ask a significant question , whether and how the observational universe may classically emerge from a de sitter background with low energy scale , and what about its scenario",
    "?    we will show that the observational universe may emerge classically from a de sitter background with low energy scale .",
    "we find , after calculating the curvature perturbation , that the resulting scenario is actually a style of the eternal inflation scenario , in which some regions will go through the slowly expanding galilean genesis phase and become island universes , while other regions are still eternally inflating .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we firstly will introduce a model , in which the observational universe may classically emerge from a de sitter background with low energy scale .",
    "the background evolution of the model will be presented in sec.ii , and the power spectrum of primordial perturbation will be calculated in sec.iii . here , though the energy scale of initial background is highly low , since the universe slowly expands with rapidly increasing energy density , the initial conditions of the hot  big bang \" evolution may be set . in sec.iv",
    ", we will illustrate the resulting scenario , i.e. in an eternally inflating background , some local regions may emerge classically and become island universes .",
    "we argue that this scenario may be a viable design of the early universe , which might help to improve the current understanding to some issues relevant with the eternal inflation .",
    "we will introduce a model , in which the observational universe may classically emerge from a de sitter background with low energy scale .",
    "the method of building models is universal . here",
    ", we will begin with such a galileon lagrangian as ~-e^4/mx+1 ^ 8x^3 - 1 ^ 7x^2- , [ l]where @xmath0 and @xmath1 is a constant with mass dimension , and @xmath2 sets up a de sitter background from which the observational universe emerges .    the evolution of background is determined by the field equation & & ( -e^4/ m+15 ^ 8x^2 + 24 ^ 7hx ) + & + & 3(-e^4/ m+3 ^ 8x^2)h + & + & ( -4e^4/ m+ 6h^2 ^ 7 + 18 h^2 ^ 2 ^ 7)x=0 [ phi]and the friedmann equation 3h^2m_p^2 = -e^4/",
    "mx+5 ^ 8x^3 + 6 ^ 7x ^3h+,[h]where @xmath3 . when @xmath4 , the universe is in eternally inflating regime , and the background is highly inhomogeneous , as will be confirmed in sec.iv .",
    "thus initially we require h .[condition]the field equation ( [ phi ] ) approximately becomes ( -e^4/ m+15 ^ 8x^2 ) -4e^4/ mx0 .",
    "[ phiapp]the solution is e^/m=(54)^1/41(t_*-t),[ephi]=m(t_*-t ) .",
    "[ dphi]this implies @xmath5 .",
    "thus eq.([h ] ) is simplified as , h^2m_p^2 + /3 = h m_p^2x^4 ( t_*-t)+/3 , [ h11]where we define x = m^1/2m_p^1/2(t_*-t)[x]for convenience .",
    "initially @xmath6 , the first term in right - hand side of eq.([h11 ] ) is negligible , which indicates that initially the universe is in a de sitter state .",
    "however , with the lapse of time , we will have @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding time is t_c~-1h_0 ^ 1/5m^2/5 m_p^2/5= ( h_0 ^ 4/5 ^ 2/5 m_p^2/5)t_0 , [ tcri]where @xmath8 .",
    "thus after @xmath9 , the universe will deviate from the de sitter state and begin to the evolution of genesis .",
    "this is just the model which we require .",
    "we will detailed illuminate how the background evolves in this model . during @xmath10 , h=",
    "^1/2h_0h_0 is almost constant .",
    "thus a~e^h_0 ( t_c - t_0),which seems indicate that the universe is exponentially expanding .",
    "however , in term of eq.([tcri ] ) and @xmath11 , we have h_0(t_c - t_0 ) = ( 1-h_0 ^ 4/5m_p^2/5m^2/5 ) h_0|t_0| < 1 , [ ht]which implies that the time that this phase lasts is shorter than one efold .",
    "thus during this period the universe is actually slowly expanding .    in certain sense , this phase is similar to the slow expansion studied in refs.@xcite,@xcite , also the slow contraction @xcite . here , @xmath12 , while in refs.@xcite,@xcite , @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath14 , the universe will deviate from the de sitter background and begin to the evolution of genesis . during @xmath15 ,",
    "h [ h2]is rapidly increasing . thus a ~e^hdt ~exp(1x^4 ) .",
    "[ aa]during this period , since @xmath16 , the universe is still slowly expanding .",
    "however , different from that during @xmath17 , the energy density of universe during this period will rapidly increase until the end of the slowly expanding phase .",
    "when @xmath18 , the slow expansion ends .",
    "the definition ( [ x ] ) of @xmath19 gives t_e= o(t_*)-1 .",
    "[ te]we assume that at @xmath20 the reheating will happen and the available energy of field will be rapidly released into the radiation .",
    "hereafter , the local universe will begin the evolution of hot  big bang \" model .",
    "eq.([h2 ] ) gives h_e .",
    "thus at this time , the energy density of galileon field is @xmath21 . in sec.iii.b",
    ", we will see the observation requires @xmath22 .",
    "thus this energy will be enough for the reheating of universe .",
    "we plot the evolutions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 with respect to the time in the inset panel of fig.1 , in which the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 are taken , we have @xmath27 from eqs.([tcri ] ) and ( [ te ] ) , which is consistent with fig.1 . here , the values of the parameters used are only to conveniently plotting the background evolution . in principle , we could have a broader choice of the range of parameters , e.g. @xmath2 is equal to or smaller than the value of the current cosmological constant .",
    "the statement of the null energy condition is equivalent to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . here , in term of eq.([h11 ] ) , we find @xmath30 through the entire evolution , which implies that during the slow expansion , the null energy condition is violated all along .    here , @xmath24 is determined by eq.([h11 ] ) , which is slightly complicated . however , for different phases , we approximately have || =    & & x^4,duringt_c < t < t_e , [ e2 ] which implies that during @xmath17 , @xmath31 is increasing with the time , while it is decreasing during @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath33 , @xmath31 arrives at its maximal value ||1 .",
    "physically , initially the universe is in a slow expanding phase with @xmath34 and @xmath35 being gradually increased , thus initially @xmath36 and will become larger and larger , while after @xmath37 the universe is in the slowly expanding galilean genesis phase with rapidly increasing @xmath24 , thus @xmath31 will be smaller and smaller . when @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 , the genesis phase ends .",
    "we plot the evolution of @xmath40 with respect to the time in fig.1 .",
    "though during the slow expansion , the null energy condition is violated all along , we will see that there is not the ghost instability .     with respect to the time is plotted , in which @xmath41 is given by eq.([te ] ) , and @xmath25 and @xmath42 are taken .",
    "the inset panel is the evolutions of @xmath23 and @xmath43 , in which initially @xmath44 , and for clarity @xmath23 has been divided by @xmath45 and @xmath43 by @xmath46 . here , @xmath27 , which is given by eq.([tcri ] ) .",
    "we see that during @xmath17 , the universe slowly expands with @xmath34 , and during this period initially @xmath36 and then will gradually increase , up to @xmath47 , while during @xmath48 , the universe is still slowly expanding but with rapidly increasing @xmath24 and decreasing @xmath31 .",

    ", we have @xcite q_r= x , [ qr]c_s^2=-e^4/ m+3x^2 ^ 8 + 8x^7(+h)-8x^4 ^ 14m_p^2 -e^4/ m+15x^2 ^ 8 + 12h^3 ^ 7 + 12x^4 ^ 14m_p^2 , both of which are determined by the evolution of background .",
    "we will firstly investigate whether there is the ghost instability around the corresponding backgrounds .    before @xmath50 , the universe is slowly expanding . during this period the galileon field is dominated , which contributes the curvature perturbation @xmath49 . here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are required for the avoidance of the ghost instability .",
    "the evolution of field is determined by eqs.([ephi ] ) and ( [ dphi ] ) .",
    "we observe that in the numerator of ( [ qr ] ) , the terms @xmath53 are dominated and other terms are negligible , while in the denominator of ( [ qr ] ) , during @xmath17 , @xmath34 is dominated , and during @xmath32 , @xmath24 is determined by eq.([h2 ] ) . thus we approximately have q_r & & mm_p^3h_0 ^ 2/x^6,duringt < t_c , [ qq ] + & & m_p^2 x^4,duringt_c < t < t_e .",
    "[ q]the similar calculations give @xmath54 during @xmath55 .",
    "thus the background is ghost - free during the slow expansion .",
    "the case is similar to that in ghost condensation mechanism , e.g. see ref.@xcite for the ekpyrotic universe . here",
    ", it is significant to notice @xmath56 .",
    "after @xmath50 , the universe will be full of the radiation , and begin the evolution of hot  big bang \" model . during this period , eq.([h ] ) become 3h^2m_p^2_rad , where @xmath57 is dominated .",
    "however , the galileon field still exists , though its energy density is negligible .    the perturbation of the galileon field has been calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the field @xmath58 is ghost - free requires @xmath59 , in which q _",
    "= -e^4/ m+3x^2 ^ 8 + 8x^7(+h)-8x^4 ^ 14m_p^2.[qdp]during the reheating , the available energy of galileon field is rapidly released into the radiation , it is reasonably imagined that after the reheating we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 . thus the absence of the ghost requires that e^4/m < x^2 ^ 8 [ con]has to be satisfied , which equals to @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 implies that the condition ( [ con ] ) is equivalent to @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath58 at the time @xmath9 can be obtained from eqs.([ephi ] ) and ( [ tcri ] ) , which is ~-(m^3m_p^2h_0)^1/5 - 1 .",
    "[ phic]thus if after the reheating the galileon field can be reset in a region from which it evolves initially , there will be not the ghost instability during the hot  big bang \" evolution .      after affirming that the background is ghost - free",
    ", we will calculate the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath66 generated during the slow expansion .",
    "the equation of @xmath49 is u_k^ + ( c^2_s k^2-z^z ) u_k = 0 , [ uk]after we define @xmath67 , which can be derived from ( [ s2 ] ) , where @xmath68 is the derivative for the conformal time @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    when @xmath71 , the perturbation mode is leaving the horizon , and hereafter it freezes out . here",
