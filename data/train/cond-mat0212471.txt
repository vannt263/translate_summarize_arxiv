    "in pure extreme type - ii superconductors , such as the high @xmath0 superconductors , the abrikosov vortex line lattice melts via a sharp first order phase transition@xcite into a vortex line liquid as the temperature is increased above a critical @xmath1 .",
    "the properties of this vortex line liquid phase have been the subject of considerable investigation .",
    "theoretical arguments@xcite and early simulations@xcite suggested that the vortex line liquid might retain superconducting phase coherence parallel to the applied magnetic field , within some temperature interval above @xmath1 .",
    "later , better converged simulations@xcite found that phase coherence is simultaneously lost in all directions upon melting .",
    "subsequently , teanovi@xcite has proposed that , for small magnetic fields , there still remains a sharp thermodynamic phase transition at a temperature @xmath2 within the vortex liquid state , associated with diverging fluctuations of closed vortex loops , such as drive the superconducting transition in the zero magnetic field case .",
    "considering the limit of infinite penetration length @xmath3 , teanovi proposed that , in a finite field , the fluctuations of the magnetic field induced vortex lines act to screen the interactions of thermally excited closed vortex loops , in the same way that magnetic field fluctuations screen the vortex loop interactions of a finite @xmath3 model in zero applied magnetic field . pursuing this argument",
    ", he predicted that the proposed vortex loop blowout transition at @xmath2 may be an inverted xy transition , as is the case of the zero field meissner transition for the finite @xmath3 model .",
    "following teanovi s predictions , sudb and co - workers@xcite have carried out numerical simulations of the three dimensional ( 3d ) uniformly frustrated xy model of a type - ii superconductor .",
    "they claim to find evidence for teanovi s transition , which they associate with the formation of a vortex line path that percolates entirely around the system in the direction transverse to the magnetic field .",
    "most recently , measurements@xcite on high purity yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( ybco ) single crystals have found a step like anomaly in the specific heat at a temperature highter than the melting @xmath1 , reminiscent of an inverted mean field transition .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that this feature may be evidence for teanovi s transition @xmath2 .    in order to further investigate this issue ,",
    "we have carried out new simulations on the 3d uniformly frustrated xy model , both repeating the approach of sudb and co - workers , and measuring new quantities that make a more direct test of teanovi s theory . after correcting certain inconsistencies in the earlier numerical work ,",
    "we show that whether or not one finds indications of a vortex loop blowout transition depends crucially on how one chooses to resolve vortex line paths at points where two or more lines intersect . making the choice that favors the blowout interpretation",
    ", we find the critical exponent @xmath7 , rather than the value @xmath8 expected for an inverted 3d xy transition .",
    "finally , we make high precision measurements of the specific heat , in search of a thermodynamic signature for a blowout transition , but no such signature is found .",
    "the model that we use is the 3d uniformly frustrated xy model@xcite which models a type - ii superconductor in the limit of infinite magnetic penetration length , @xmath9 , and is given by the hamiltonian , @xmath10 = -\\sum_{i , \\mu}j_{\\mu}\\cos       ( \\theta_{i+\\hat\\mu}-\\theta_{i}-a_{i\\mu})\\enspace . \\label{eqh}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 are the nodes of a cubic grid of sites , @xmath12 @xmath13 , are the directions of the grid axes , and the sum is over all nearest neighbor bonds of the grid . @xmath14 is the phase angle of the superconducting wavefunction on site @xmath11 , @xmath15 is given by the integral of the magnetic vector potential @xmath16 across the bond at site @xmath11 in direction @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the flux quantum .",
    "the argument of the cosine is the gauge invariant phase angle difference across the bond .",
    "the circulation of the @xmath19 around any plaquette of the grid is equal to @xmath20 times number of flux quanta of magnetic field penetrating the plaquette .",
    "we take the magnetic field , @xmath21 , uniform and parallel to the @xmath22 axis , with a fixed density of flux quanta @xmath23 per plaquette of area @xmath24 . the couplings @xmath25 we take to model an anisotropic system , with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "simulations are carried out varying the @xmath28 according to a usual monte carlo scheme ; the @xmath19 are held fixed . that the @xmath19 do not fluctuate , and that they give a uniform magnetic field , are the consequences of the @xmath9 approximation .",
    "simulations are carried out on @xmath29 cubic grids , using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "except where otherwise noted , our runs are typically for @xmath30 to @xmath31 monte carlo passes through the entire lattice .    while we simulate in the phase angle degrees of freedom , @xmath28 , our interest will be in the behavior of the vorticity in these phase angles .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the _ dual _ sites of the original grid ; these are the sites at the centers of the unit cells of the grid .",
    "denote by @xmath33 the plaquette which is the face of the unit cell centered on dual site @xmath32 with normal in the @xmath17 direction , @xmath34 , @xmath13 .",
    "we define the integer vorticity @xmath35 piercing plaquette @xmath33 by computing the circulation of the gauge invariant phase angle differences around the plaquette , @xmath36       = 2\\pi ( n_{s\\mu } -f\\delta_{z\\mu})\\enspace,\\ ] ] where the sum is counterclockwise around all bonds forming the boundary of plaquette @xmath33 , and the gauge invariant phase angle differences are restricted to the interval @xmath37 . in a constant magnetic field",
    ", the condition that the total energy density remains finite can be shown to yield the `` neutrality '' constraint ( see section iii.a ) , @xmath38 i.e. the total vorticity piercing any plane at constant @xmath13 is @xmath39 ; these are the magnetic field induced vortex lines .",
    "the total vorticity in the transverse directions @xmath40 and @xmath41 is zero .    taking the vorticity @xmath35 as the directed bond of the dual grid , emanating from site @xmath32 in direction @xmath17 , the vorticity so defined is divergenceless , forming continuous lines that , due to the periodic boundary conditions , must ultimately close upon themselves .",
    "we will label such a closed vortex path by the index @xmath42 , and define the vector @xmath43 as the net displacement one travels upon following the path @xmath42 from a given starting point until returning back to that point as the line closes back on itself . if @xmath44 , then the vortex line path is a closed loop of finite extent that exists as a thermal fluctuation .",
    "if @xmath45 , @xmath46 integer , then such a vortex line path represents @xmath46 of the @xmath39 field induced vortex lines ; these @xmath46 lines are mutually connected to each other via the periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath13 direction.@xcite for @xmath47 , we can say that the @xmath46 field induced lines are geometrically entangled with each other .",
    "if @xmath48 or @xmath49 , then the vortex line path winds @xmath46 times around the system _ transversely _ to the applied magnetic field",
    ". we will be particularly interested in vortex line paths for which @xmath50 , but @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to as the `` lines '' , the set of vortex line paths @xmath53 for which all @xmath54 ; these are the field induced vortex lines .",
    "all other vortex paths we will refer to as the `` loops '' .    in order to trace out vortex line paths , one needs to know how to treat intersections .",
    "an intersection is when there is more than one vortex line entering and exiting a give unit cell of the grid , and it is therefore ambiguous which entering segment to connect to which exiting segment .",
    "it was previously shown@xcite by one of us that the method chosen to resolve such intersections can have a dramatic effect on the statistics of closed thermally excited loops in the zero field @xmath55 model . here ,",
    "for the @xmath56 model , we consider two different schemes , which we henceforth refer to as method ( i ) and method ( ii ) :    \\(i ) at each intersection we choose randomly , with equal probability , which entering segment connects to which exiting segment . in the @xmath55 model",
    "this scheme was found to give results closest to theoretical expectations.@xcite    \\(ii ) motivated by sudb and co - workers,@xcite we first search@xcite through all possible connections to find a path @xmath42 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "such a path winds around the system transverse to the field , without ever winding around the system parallel to the field .",
    "if one such path is found , it is selected as a path @xmath57 contributing to the `` loops '' , and we then repeat the proceedure applied to all remaining vortex paths .",
    "when all such transverse paths are found , the remaining vortex line intersections are resolved randomly , as in method ( i ) .    using either method",
    "( i ) or method ( ii ) we thus decompose the vorticity of any given configuration into disjoint closed vortex line paths , consisting of a set @xmath53 of `` lines '' and a set @xmath58 of `` loops '' .",
    "we first attempt a direct test of teanovi s theory of the @xmath2 transition within the liquid phase .",
    "a summary of his arguments for the existence of this transition is as follows .",
    "first , a duality transformation@xcite from the xy model of eq.([eqh ] ) gives the interaction between vortices as , @xmath59={1\\over 2}\\sum_{s , s^{\\prime},\\mu }       [ n_{s\\mu}-f\\delta_{z\\mu}]v^{\\mu}({\\bf r}_{s}-{\\bf       r}_{s^{\\prime}})[n_{s^{\\prime}\\mu}-f\\delta_{z\\mu } ] \\label{eqv}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the appropriate anisotropic generalization of the coulomb interaction , with fourier transform @xmath61 .",
    "it is this singularity of @xmath62 as @xmath63 that yields the constraint of eq.([eqneutral ] ) .",
    "next , one imagines decomposing the total vorticity of the system into lines and loops , @xmath64 if we define , @xmath65 then @xmath66 and the hamiltonian of eq.([eqv ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath67v^{\\mu}({\\bf r}_{s}-{\\bf           r}_{s^{\\prime}})[n_{s^{\\prime}\\mu}^\\mathrm{loops}-b_{s^{\\prime}\\mu}]\\enspace . \\label{eqloop}\\ ] ] teanovi then argues that a coarse graining of vortex fluctuations , in the vortex line liquid phase , leads to an effective hydrodynamic hamiltonian on long length scales which has the same interaction piece as eq.([eqloop ] ) , but which has a new additive term proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "the resulting long length scale hamiltonian then has exactly the same form as that of a zero field superconductor with thermally fluctuating vortex loops , @xmath69 , _ and _ a thermally fluctuating magnetic field @xmath70 whose average is zero , i.e. the zero field superconductor with a finite penetration length @xmath3 . in other words , in this _ infinite _ @xmath3 theory at _ finite _ magnetic field , the long wave length fluctuations of the field induced vortex lines @xmath71 screen the interaction between the vortex loops @xmath69 in exactly the same manner as magnetic field fluctuations screen the interactions between vortex loops in a _",
    "@xmath3 model at _ zero _ magnetic field .    the meissner transition at @xmath72 in the zero field , finite @xmath3 , model is an _ inverted _",
    "3d xy transition.@xcite the high temperature phase @xmath73 has vortex loops on all length scales and breaks a global @xmath74 symmetry associated with a _ disorder _",
    "parameter;@xcite the low temperature phase @xmath75 has no vortex loops on sufficiently long length scales .",
    "the correlation length @xmath76 and renormalized magnetic penetration length @xmath77 both diverge@xcite as @xmath78 .",
    "we have earlier carried out numerical simulations@xcite of this zero field , finite @xmath3 , meissner transition .",
    "we demonstrated that , in this model , magnetic field fluctuations obey the finite size scaling relation , @xmath79 where in the above @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the fourier transform of of the magnetic flux density @xmath70 .",
    "as @xmath82 , and @xmath63 , @xmath83 hence @xmath84 vanishes below the transition , and increases continuously from zero as one goes above the transition .    in the present case of a finite magnetic field , if teanovi s mapping is correct , the meissner transition @xmath72 becomes the transition @xmath85 within the vortex line liquid phase , and we expect the exact same scaling as in eq.([eqscal ] ) above , when applied to the quantity @xmath70 defined in eq.([eqb ] ) .",
    "taking the limit of @xmath63 in eq.([eqscal ] ) , and applying to systems with fixed aspect ratio @xmath86 , we expect the scaling , @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    for the directions @xmath90 or @xmath91",
    ", @xmath92 is the net vorticity of the magnetic field induced vortex lines in the transverse direction @xmath17 .",
    "the two dimensional vector @xmath93 defined above is the integer valued `` winding number '' that counts the net number of times the field induced vortex lines wind around the system in the transverse directions @xmath94 and @xmath91 . if @xmath53 is the set of vortex line paths that define the field induced vortex lines @xmath71 , and @xmath95 is the net displacement along path @xmath42 as defined earlier , then @xmath96 , where @xmath97 .",
    "we thus expect from eq.([eqscal2 ] ) the finite size scaling , @xmath98 note , the neutrality condition of eq.([eqneutral ] ) implies that the _ total _ transverse vorticity in the system must always vanish . for @xmath99 , it is therefore necessary that any such winding of the field induced lines is exactly canceled out by an equal and opposite transverse winding of the loops . in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath100 , eq.([eqscal1 ] )",
    "implies that @xmath101 for @xmath102 , and @xmath103 increases continuously from zero as one increases @xmath104 . the proposed transition at @xmath85 is thus associated with the appearance of infinite transverse loops ( see following section iv ) .",
    "another interpretation of the @xmath85 transition follows from the `` two dimensional ( 2d ) boson '' model@xcite of interacting vortex lines , in which the field induced vortex lines are viewed as the world lines of two dimensional bosons traveling down the imaginary time axis . for @xmath102 where @xmath105 , the field induced vortex lines behave like _ charged _ two dimensional bosons,@xcite with a long range retarded coulomb interaction . in the vortex line liquid , @xmath106 , where phase coherence is lost parallel to the applied magnetic field ,",
    "the analog 2d bosons are in a _ charged _ superfluid state . for @xmath104 , where @xmath107 , screening by the infinitely large loops @xmath69 results in an effective short ranged interaction between the field induced lines . in this case",
    "the winding number squared @xmath108 is proportional to the superfluid density of what is now an _",
    "uncharged _ superfluid .",
    "thus @xmath85 corresponds to a transition between a charged superfluid and an uncharged superfluid in the analog 2d boson theory .",
    "equivalently , if one considers the quanta that mediate the interaction between the analog 2d bosons , the transition is from massless quanta for @xmath102 to massive quanta for @xmath104 .    to arrive at eq.([eqscal3 ] ) , we considered the transverse components of eq.([eqscal2 ] ) .",
    "however , we can also consider the parallel , @xmath109 component .",
    "now , @xmath110 and so we expect the scaling @xmath111 if @xmath53 is the set of vortex line paths that define the field induced vortex lines @xmath71 , and @xmath95 is the net displacement along path @xmath42 as defined earlier , then @xmath112 .",
    "thus @xmath113 gives the number of `` lines '' in excess of the average value @xmath39 set by the applied magnetic field .",
    "the neutrality condition of eq.([eqneutral ] ) requires that when @xmath114 , there must be an equal and opposite parallel winding of the loops @xmath69 . as @xmath82 , we have @xmath115 for @xmath102 , and @xmath114 for @xmath104 .",
    "thus a transition at @xmath85 should be characterized by fluctuations in the number of field induced lines and by the appearance of infinite parallel loops directed opposite to the direction of the applied magnetic field .      to test the above predictions , we have simulated the 3d uniformly frustrated xy model of eq.([eqh ] ) using a vortex density @xmath116 , anisotropy @xmath117 , and aspect ratio @xmath118 , for @xmath119 @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 . for these parameters ,",
    "the vortex lattice melting temperature is @xmath124 , and the zero field critical temperature is @xmath125 .",
    "we compute the transverse winding @xmath126 of the field induced lines , defined by eq.([eqwp ] ) , using both method ( i ) and method ( ii ) to decompose each configuration into `` lines '' and `` loops '' .",
    "according to the scaling equation ( [ eqscal3 ] ) , we expect that plots of @xmath108 vs. @xmath127 for different sizes @xmath128 should all intersect at the common point @xmath129 , or @xmath130 .    in fig.[f1 ]",
    "we show a semilog plot of @xmath108 vs. @xmath131 using method ( i ) ( random reconnections at intersections ) for @xmath132 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "we see that there is clearly no common intersection point of the curves . as @xmath128 increases ,",
    "@xmath108 decreases uniformly over the entire temperature range .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with earlier computations of @xmath108 by one of us ( see fig .  15 of ref . ) . for @xmath133 ,",
    "we have found no net transverse winding of the field induced lines at all , i.e. for the length of our simulation we had @xmath134 , for the temperature range @xmath135 .",
    "= 3.2truein    next , in fig.[f2 ] ,",
    "we show the same quantities but now using method ( ii ) ( search first for maximal transverse loops ) , for @xmath119 @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we see that as @xmath128 increases , the curves do seem to approach a common intersection point , giving a @xmath136 . note that this @xmath85 is _ above _ the zero field critical temperature @xmath125 .    from eq.([eqscal3 ] ) , we expect that the slopes of these curves at @xmath85 should scale with system size as , @xmath137 .",
    "fitting each of the curves of @xmath138 to a cubic polynomial in @xmath127 , we compute their derivatives at the intersection point @xmath139 , and plot the results vs. @xmath140 in fig.[f2.1 ] .",
    "we see that the slopes , to an excellent approximation , scale linearly with @xmath140 , thus suggesting a critical exponent @xmath7 . on closer inspection ,",
    "the data in fig.[f2.1 ] show a small systematic downwards curvature about the linear fit ; however this curvature can be removed by assuming a slightly higher critical temperature of @xmath141 .",
    "note that this value of @xmath7 is _ larger _ than the predicted value of @xmath142 .    as an alternative method to compute the critical behavior",
    ", we can take the scaling equation ( [ eqscal3 ] ) , expand the scaling function @xmath143 as a polynomial for small @xmath40 , and do a nonlinear fitting to the data to determine the unknown polynomial coefficients , @xmath85 , and @xmath144 . to obtain the best fit we use a 4th order polynomial and fit only the data from the two largest sizes , @xmath145 and @xmath123 .",
    "the results give @xmath146 and @xmath147 , in agreement with the earlier estimates . in fig.[f3 ] we show the scaling collapse that results from this polynomial fit .",
    "there are systematic deviations from the fitted curve on the @xmath104 side , though these appear to decrease as @xmath128 increases .",
    "= 3.2truein    = 3.2truein    = 3.2truein    next we consider the excess parallel winding of the field induced lines @xmath148 . as discussed earlier ,",
    "teanovi s theory predicts a scaling of @xmath149 as in eq.([eqscalz ] ) . to determine @xmath148 we count the winding of vortex line paths @xmath53 that wind negatively in the @xmath13 direction , i.e. have a net displacement of @xmath150 , with @xmath151 a positive integer ( @xmath152 may have any value for such paths ) .",
    "since such negative parallel windings must be compensated for by excess field `` lines '' , we have @xmath153 .",
    "however , when we have used either of our tracing methods ( i ) or ( ii ) , we have _ never _ found _ any _ such negative parallel windings up to the highest temperature we have simulated , @xmath154 .",
    "this has motivated us to define a third tracing scheme : ( iii ) we first search through all possible connections to find any paths with @xmath155 .    in fig.[f3.1 ]",
    "we show results , using tracing scheme ( iii ) , for @xmath149 vs. @xmath156 for the same system parameters and sizes as used in fig.[f2 ] for @xmath157 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath149 where the curves for different @xmath140 intersect are exceedingly small .",
    "the intersection points appear to decrease in @xmath127 as @xmath140 increases , however we do not have the accuracy to make any firm conclusions .    in an attempt to improve the analysis of @xmath149 we have repeated the calculation , but using a new system aspect ratio of @xmath158 .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the value where the curves of @xmath149 intersect , and so hopefully improving our accuracy .",
    "we have explicitly checked that changing the aspect ratio does not shift the transition temperature @xmath85 that is observed in @xmath157 ( see also section iv.b ) . in fig.[f3.2 ] we show results for @xmath149 vs. @xmath156 for this new aspect ratio .",
    "again we find no common intersection point for the sizes considered .",
    "as @xmath140 increases , the intersection point continues to decrease . whether this is a failure of the scaling hypothesis of eq.([eqscalz ] ) , or whether we have simply failed to reach the scaling limit of sufficiently large @xmath159 ( @xmath160 is the largest value in fig.[f3.2 ] ) , we can not be certain .",
    "note that in both figs.[f3.1 ] and [ f3.2 ] , @xmath149 appears to be vanishing at a temperature noticeably _ above _ the @xmath161 where the curves of the transverse winding , @xmath157 , intersect .",
    "we have also tried to fit the data of fig.[f3.2 ] to the scaling form , @xmath162 , assuming a non trivial anomalous scaling dimension @xmath40 ( although we have no specific theoretical reason to propose this form ) .",
    "when we do so , we obtain @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 , however our data in the vicinity of this @xmath0 is too scattered for us to place much significance on this fit .",
    "having used tracing method ( iii ) to first eliminate all possible lines percolating in the negative @xmath22 direction , we can then go and search for all possible transversely percolating lines and compute the resulting transverse winding @xmath157 .",
    "when we do this , we find our results for @xmath157 virtually unchanged from tracing method ( ii ) in the vicinity of @xmath161 .",
    "the extremely low number of negative @xmath22 percolating lines at this temperature produces no noticeable effect on the transverse tracing .",
    "= 3.2truein    = 3.2truein",
    "as discussed in the preceding section iii.a , a transition at @xmath85 would mark the appearance of infinite transverse loops , as @xmath127 is increased . the idea to explicitly look for transverse paths that percolate across the system",
    "was first put forth by jagla and balseiro.@xcite later , sudb and co - workers@xcite refined this idea .",
    "they defined a quantity which they denoted @xmath166 , which is the probability that a vortex path exists which travels completely across the system in a direction transverse to the applied magnetic field , without ever traveling completely across the system in the direction parallel to the field .",
    "if such a path exists in a given configuration , that configuration counts as unity in the average for @xmath166 ; if not , that configuration counts as zero .    since having @xmath167 in a given configuration necessarily implies that there is a percolating transverse loop in that configuration , there is a close connection between the quantities @xmath108 and @xmath166 .",
    "they differ in that ( i ) for a configuration with @xmath168 , and hence with more than one percolating transverse loop , the contribution to @xmath166 remains unity , rather than increasing with the number of percolating transverse loops ; and ( ii ) in a configuration with two percolating but oppositely oriented transverse loops , the contribution to @xmath166 will be unity , but these loops cancel each other in their contribution to @xmath169 , which might therefore be zero .    since @xmath166 is a pure number one might expect it to be a scale invariant quantity , and hence , similar to @xmath108 , plots of @xmath166 vs. @xmath127 for different system sizes @xmath128 should have a common intersection point at @xmath85 .    sudb and co - workers method of searching for such percolating transverse paths is similar to our method ( ii ) except for one crucial difference.@xcite they do not require that the transverse path closes upon itself ; they only require that the path start at one end of the system , say at @xmath170 , and continue until reaching the opposite end , @xmath171 , while keeping the distance traveled along @xmath22 less than @xmath172 , that is the displacement traveled along the path @xmath42 satisfies @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "since , by the periodic boundary conditions , all paths _ must _ eventually close upon themselves , there are two possibilities for the transverse percolating paths that sudb and co - workers find .",
    "we illustrate these in fig.[f4 ] : ( 1 ) the path @xmath42 eventually closes upon itself without ever traveling the length @xmath172 , in which case @xmath50 ; or ( 2 ) the path @xmath42 , when followed until it closes upon itself , does wind up traveling the length @xmath172 , with a displacement @xmath175 ; in this case , our method ( ii ) would consider this path as part of the field induced vortex lines @xmath71 , contributing to the winding @xmath126 , rather than as a transverse loop that contributes to @xmath69 .",
    "we will call sudb s path tracing method ( ii@xmath176 ) to distinguish it from our method ( ii ) .",
    "the probability for a percolating path using method ( ii@xmath176 ) we will denote by @xmath177 ; using method ( ii ) we will denote it by @xmath166 .",
    "paths of type ( 2 ) will contribute to @xmath177 , but not to @xmath166 .",
    "we will see that there are very dramatic differences between these two methods , and that only @xmath166 gives self - consistent results .",
    "= 3.2truein      first , we note that if we use method ( i ) ( random connections ) to search for percolating transverse paths , the result is essentially the same as found for @xmath157 in section iii.b . as @xmath128 increases , the probability to find a percolating transverse loop steadily decreases for the entire temperature range , becoming immeasurably small for our biggest system size .",
    "hence we will focus here on methods ( ii ) and ( ii@xmath176 ) .",
    "we now consider the computation of @xmath177 using method ( ii@xmath176 ) , the one used by sudb and co - workers , which never checks to see how the percolating transverse path closes upon itself .",
    "we first use parameters @xmath178 and @xmath179 , the same as in section iii.b , but a more dilute density of vortex lines @xmath180 . for these parameters ,",
    "the vortex lattice melting temperature is @xmath181 , and the zero field critical temperature , as before , is @xmath125 .",
    "these parameters are very close to the parameters of one of the cases studied by sudb and co - workers in refs .   and",
    "( they used @xmath180 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) .",
    "our results for @xmath177 vs @xmath156 , for three system sizes , @xmath184 , @xmath123 and @xmath185 , are shown as the solid symbols on the left hand side of fig.[f5 ] .",
    "these results agree quite closely with those of sudb and co - workers ( see fig.8 of ref . ) , and seem to show what might be a common intersection of the three curves near @xmath186 .",
    "however , we now consider the same parameters and sizes @xmath128 , only using a different system aspect ratio , @xmath187 .",
    "the results are shown as the open symbols on the right hand side of fig.[f5 ] .",
    "we see that there no longer appears to be a common intersection point , but more importantly , the curves have all shifted dramatically to higher temperatures .",
