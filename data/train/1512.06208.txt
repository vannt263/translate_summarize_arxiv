    "symplectic homology , as introduced in @xcite , is a generalization of floer theory to non - compact symplectic manifolds ( or compact symplectic manifolds with boundary ) . as such , it has not only an additive structure ( chain groups and a differential ) , but also other algebraic operations , coming from counting riemann surfaces with an arbitrary number of positive and negative punctures .",
    "most notably , there is a ( commutative and associative ) product called pair - of - pants product and a unit , giving symplectic homology the structure of a commutative unital ring .    on the other hand ,",
    "symplectic homology is very hard to compute already on the additive level , mainly because the differential is defined by counting solutions to a certain pde involving , among other things , the choice of a generic almost complex structure .",
    "the same difficulty applies for computations of the product structure .",
    "therefore , the ring structure of symplectic homology is known only in few examples .",
    "known examples include :    * subcritical stein manifolds @xcite , where symplectic homology vanishes , * cotangent bundles @xcite , where symplectic homology is isomorphic to the homology of the loop space with the chas  sullivan product , * negative line bundles @xcite , where symplectic homology is related to gromov  witten theory and quantum cohomology .",
    "this paper attempts to apply the techniques of @xcite to the more general case of contact manifolds with periodic reeb flow .",
    "for this to make sense , we need a notion of symplectic homology that is an invariant of contact manifolds , not the fillings .",
    "one such notion could be positive symplectic homology , but this has the drawback of not carrying a unital product .",
    "instead , we will use the @xmath3-shaped symplectic homology @xmath4 from @xcite , which is isomorphic to rabinowitz floer homology @xmath0 by ( * ? ? ?",

    "our main tool to get structural results for @xmath11 , which builds upon ideas from @xcite , is to study the action of a loop of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms @xmath20 on @xmath11 .",

    "furthermore , theorem  [ thm_intro_module ] gives some product computation that would be very difficult to prove directly . in examples , however , it turns out that there can be further relations between the generators of the module , so theorem  [ thm_intro_module ] does not reveal the full ring structure of @xmath11 .    while the index conditions and are quite restrictive , both of them can be relaxed if @xmath13 admits a liouville filling @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",

    "it turns out that , with the right choice of module generators , the image of @xmath42 in @xmath11 is the subset of elements with non - negative powers of @xmath2 .",

    "we show in section  [ sec_no_filling ] that in most cases , the reeb flow does not extend to a hamiltonian diffeomorphism on any symplectic filling , hence the need to work in the symplectization .",

    "after that , we can establish the @xmath1$]-module structure of @xmath11 , though still without relating it to the pair - of - pants product .",
    "this relation is finally proven in sections  [ sec_homot_inv ] and [ sec_application_product ] , while section  [ sec_back_to_usual_sh ] proves corollary  [ cor_intro_sh ] .    in section  [ sec_brieskorn ] , we apply the theorems from section  [ sec_ham_diff ] to the example of brieskorn manifolds , where the chain groups of @xmath11 can be computed explicitly .",
    "this section also contains comparisons to specific examples where the ring structure of symplectic homology is known , namely cotangent bundles of spheres and the @xmath43-surface singularities .",
    "the upshot of these comparisons is that the results of this paper are confirmed in these examples , but they reveal only a part of the product structure on symplectic homology .    _",

    "the product in hamiltonian floer theory always involves a count of pairs - of - pants between three hamiltonian orbits , although the precise definition varies slightly in the literature . here",
    ", we will follow the approach from @xcite .",

    "assume that @xmath58 is convex near infinity , i.e.  outside a compact set of @xmath47 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radial coordinate , @xmath64 is a primitive of the symplectic form and @xmath41 is any smooth function .",
    "moreover , assume that the hamiltonians @xmath65 are linear at infinity with slopes @xmath66 and @xmath54 is linear at infinity with slope function @xmath67",

    "for example , one does not get a product on the whole positive symplectic homology , but one can define maps @xmath94 that contain a part of the information of the product on @xmath83 .      for the purposes of this text , it will be important to have a version of symplectic homology that is defined on the symplectization of a contact manifold , without reference to a symplectic filling .",

    "however , @xmath96 does not have a product , see remark [ rmk_action_filtr ] .",
    "one might try to use the `` partial products '' from instead , but this has the drawback that there is no unit , which is needed in some arguments below .",
