    "the study of rotating flows is of interest for a wide range of problems , ranging from engineering ( e.g. , turbomachinery ) , astrophysics ( galactic and accretion discs ) to geophysics ( oceans , the atmosphere of the earth , gaseous planets ) and weather predictions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "inertial waves arise in rotating flows and are observed in the atmosphere of the earth and in laboratory rotating flows . in turbulent",
    "rotating flows inertial waves are damped due to a high turbulent viscosity .",
    "thus , excitation of coherent and undamped inertial waves by turbulence seems not to be effective .",
    "however , large - scale inertial waves are observed in turbulent rotating flows .",
    "a mechanism of excitation of the large - scale coherent inertial waves in turbulence is not well understood .",
    "inertial waves are related with generation of large - scale vorticity .",
    "generation of a large - scale vorticity in a helical turbulence due to hydrodynamical @xmath0 effect was suggested in @xcite .",
    "this effect is associated with the @xmath1 term in the equation for the mean vorticity , where @xmath2 are the perturbations of the mean vorticity and @xmath0 is determined by the hydrodynamical helicity of turbulent flow .",
    "a nonzero hydrodynamical helicity is caused , e.g. , by a combined effect of an uniform rotation and inhomogeneity of turbulence .",
    "formation of large - scale vortices in a turbulent rotating flows was studied experimentally and in numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "formation of large - scale coherent structures ( e.g. , large - scale cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices ) in a small - scale turbulence is one of the characteristic features of rotating turbulence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to describe generation of a mean flow by a small - scale rotating turbulence , e.g. , the effect of angular momentum mixing @xcite and vorticity expulsion @xcite .",
    "the first experimental demonstration wherein it was shown that the divergence of the reynolds stresses can generate an organized mean circulation was described in @xcite .",
    "there is a certain similarity between mean rotation and a mean velocity shear .",
    "generation of a mean vorticity in a nonhelical homogeneous incompressible turbulent flow with an imposed mean velocity shear due to an excitation of a large - scale instability was studied in @xcite .",
    "this instability is caused by a combined effect of the large - scale shear motions (  skew - induced `` deflection of equilibrium mean vorticity ) and  reynolds stress - induced '' generation of perturbations of the mean vorticity .",
    "this instability and the dynamics of the mean vorticity are associated with the prandtl s turbulent secondary flows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , a turbulence with an imposed mean velocity shear and a uniformly rotating turbulence are different . in particular , the mean vorticity is generated by a homogeneous nonhelical sheared turbulence @xcite . on the other hand , the mean",
    "vorticity can not be generated by a homogeneous uniformly rotating nonhelical turbulence ( see below ) .",
    "the main difference between these two flows is that the mean velocity shear produces work in a turbulent flow , while a uniform rotation does not produce work in a homogeneous turbulent flow .",
    "there are other interesting problems related with the inertial waves including , e.g. , the effect of inertial waves on the onset of convection and on the turbulence dynamics . in particular , the onset of convection in the form of inertial waves in a rotating fluid sphere were studied in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the modification of turbulence dynamics by rotation is due to the presence of small - scale inertial waves in rotating flows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study large - scale structures formed in a rotating inhomogeneous turbulence .",
    "in particular , we investigate the excitation of large - scale inertial waves .",
    "these structures are associated with a generation of a large - scale vorticity due to the excitation of the large - scale instability in an uniformly rotating inhomogeneous turbulence .",

    "iii the effective force was determined , which allowed us to derive the mean - filed equations and to study the excitation of large - scale inertial waves in section iv .",
