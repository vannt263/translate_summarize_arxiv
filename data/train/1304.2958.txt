    "turbulence plays an important role in space and astrophysical plasmas by mediating the transfer of energy from large - scale motions to the small scales at which the turbulence can be dissipated .",
    "a major unsolved problem is the identification of the physical mechanisms that dissipate the small - scale turbulent motions , ultimately converting the turbulent energy to plasma heat .",
    "the dynamics at the dissipative scales are typically weakly collisional in diffuse astrophysical plasmas , such as the solar wind , so the mechanisms responsible for the dissipation and plasma heating are described by kinetic plasma physics .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed to be the dominantly involved in the dissipation process for plasma turbulence : collisionless wave - particle interactions @xcite and dissipation in small - scale current sheets @xcite .    in weakly collisional plasmas , it is well known that wave - particle interactions lead to significant collisionless damping of the linear kinetic wave modes . in turbulent astrophysical plasmas",
    ", it has been proposed that the fluctuations at perpendicular scales smaller than the ion larmor radius , @xmath0 , have properties typical of kinetic alfvn waves @xcite , and will therefore suffer collisionless damping . in the case of the solar wind",
    ", it has been suggested @xcite that electron landau damping dominates the dissipation of these turbulent electromagnetic fluctuations at @xmath0 .",
    "free energy transferred conservatively to the particle distribution functions by wave - particle interactions is ultimately thermalized by arbitrarily weak collisions through the action of an entropy cascade in phase space @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of recent studies focusing on the intermittent structures that inherently develop in plasma turbulence have suggested that dissipation dominantly occurs in coherent structures , in particular , small - scale current sheets @xcite . the kinetic physical mechanism by which dissipation occurs in current sheets has not been clearly elucidated .",
    "hybrid kinetic - ion and fluid - electron simulations in 2d suggest stochastic perpendicular ion heating due to demagnetization in current sheets @xcite , 2d and 3d particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of reconnection suggest the acceleration of electrons by parallel electric fields @xcite and/or fermi acceleration @xcite , and 2d gyrokinetic simulations suggest linear phase mixing / landau damping @xcite .",
    "temperature measurements in the near - earth solar wind have been used to both support @xcite and refute @xcite the proposal that plasma heating dominantly occurs in current sheets .    in this letter , we present a wave - driven , 3d gyrokinetic turbulence simulation at scales smaller than the ion larmor radius that self - consistently generates small - scale current sheets .",
    "we find that the current sheet filling fraction is well correlated with the electron heating rate in the simulation . yet",
    ", ohmic dissipation is negligible , and the measured electron heating rate by scale is well reproduced by assuming dissipation is entirely associated with electron landau damping , suggesting the possibility that the current sheets are damped collisionlessly by resonant wave - particle interactions and correspond to regions of local heating .",

    "this prediction for wave - particle damping , plotted in figure  [ fig : heating ] ( dotted ) , admits _ no free parameters _ , yet it agrees well with the measured collisional electron heating ( solid ) : the integrated , total predicted electron heating is within @xmath82 of the collisional heating diagnosed in ` astrogk ` . the slight excess of wave - particle damping at @xmath83 and of electron collisional heating at @xmath84 is consistent with the action of the electron entropy cascade @xcite . through the entropy cascade , energy removed by electron landau damping at @xmath85 is expected to appear as collisional heating at higher wavenumbers .",

    "theory predicts negligible ohmic heating for a weakly collisional plasma , since electron - ion collisions are insufficient to significantly heat the electrons .",

    "this unexpected agreement raises the interesting possibility that the dissipation of the current sheets in the simulation occurs entirely via landau damping .",
    "the solution to this puzzle lies in the relationship between the current and magnetic field , namely @xmath92 .",
    "this relationship implies that regions of strong current correspond to regions with enhanced small - scale magnetic structure since the current is weighted toward small spatial scales . since the linear kinetic damping rate increases with wavenumber",
    ", regions with enhanced small - scale magnetic structure will also correspond to regions of enhanced wave - particle damping .",
    "therefore , regions of strong current may also correspond to regions of enhanced wave - particle damping .    to test this hypothesis",

    "the result of the filtering is plotted in figure  [ fig : heatvstime_filt ] , where all of the cross correlations exceed @xmath94 , with the exception of the antenna power , which remains poorly correlated .     with",
    "a high - pass filter applied to remove modes with @xmath95 , except the antenna current . ]",
    "the picture suggested by this simulation is one in which current sheets are self - consistently formed by the interaction of kinetic alfvn wave - like fluctuations , where each of the fluctuations is dissipating at its landau damping rate .",
    "therefore , current sheet formation and dissipation is dominated by the evolution of the alfvnic turbulence , and current sheets correspond to sites of enhanced dissipation and heating , as suggested by recent analyses of solar wind turbulence @xcite .",
    "the validity of the landau prescription described in this manuscript is predicated on the distribution function not deviating significantly from maxwellian .",
    "this can be simply tested by examining the electron fluid velocity moments .",
    "we find that @xmath96 based on the value of @xmath97 determined in  [ sec : kin_sim ] , suggesting that the landau prescription is indeed valid .",
    "a more detailed examination of the electron distribution functions within regions of intense current in our simulations is necessary to confirm the dominance of the dissipation by electron landau damping .",

    "the electron heating rate as a function of scale is well predicted by assuming that all dissipation is due to collisionless damping of the turbulent fluctuations via landau resonance with the electrons . in the weakly collisional plasma ,",
