    "a logarithmic rise with @xmath2 is seen as expected from theoretical predictions using the parameterizations listed in table [ tab - chi2 ] .",
    "single - tagged two - photon events recorded by the aleph detector at lep i and lep ii have been studied in three and two bins of @xmath14 , which have a mean of 9.9 , 20.7 and @xmath3 and 13.7 and @xmath5 .",
