    "error thresholds for fault - tolerant quantum procedures are typically calculated assuming random , independent pauli errors @xcite .",
    "this error model allows for efficient calculation of thresholds for quantum error correction ( qec ) protocols @xcite .",
    "actual errors in the laboratory often differ from this approximation and the question remains if these errors are sufficiently small and independent for qec .",
    "there are a number of methods for measuring the error , from the average fidelity @xcite , which is easy to measure experimentally @xcite , to the diamond distance @xcite , a more challenging measurement . for random pauli errors",
    ", there is no substantial difference between using the average fidelity or the diamond distance to measure the gate error .",
    "small incoherent errors can be well approximated by pauli errors . in turn",
    ", these pauli error models can accurately reproduce the behavior of quantum error - correcting ( qec ) protocols in the presence of incoherent channels @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the noise process is best described by a unitary operation , there is a large difference between the error magnitude quantified by the fidelity and the diamond distance @xcite .",
    "one could generate two distinct pauli channels to approximate the error .",
    "the first one corresponds to the pauli twirling approximation , an optimistic model that matches the error in the fidelity .",
    "the second one is a pessimistic model that is constrained to not underestimate a distance - based measure , like the average trace distance or the diamond distance @xcite .",
    "the latter are referred to as honest approximations .",
    "the question we address here is how optimistic or pessimistic are these approximations in practice .",
    "we do this in the context of exact simulation of the errors using the steane [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] code @xcite .",
    "we previously used this code to test expanded efficient error models based on clifford gates and pauli measurements for incoherent channels @xcite . in order to understand the difference between incoherent errors , such as amplitude damping , and coherent errors , such as an unwanted rotation , we start with the respective process matrices",
    "we then examine the small error limit and perform a polynomial expansion of each entry in the process matrix in terms of the error strength parameter and base our analysis on the leading order terms .",
    "we also construct effective 1-qubit process matrices for a qec step with the respective error channels acting on the physical qubits .",
    "this method provides a way to visualize how an error channel is modified by qec . in real quantum information processing systems , errors arise from both incoherent and coherent processes @xcite .",
    "however , we focus on purely incoherent and coherent errors to emphasize their respective distinctive features .",
    "we include two coherent error models in our analysis , an over - rotation about the @xmath0 and the hadamard , @xmath1 , axes .",
    "finally , we quantify the error magnitude at the physical and logical levels using various metrics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : low_error_limit ] we introduce our effective 1-qubit process ( @xmath2 ) matrix method and give an illustrative example employing the 3-qubit bit - flip code . in section [ sec : effective_chi ] we present the physical process matrices and the effective 1-qubit process for the model error channels and their approximations in the low noise limit",
    ". we also present the error magnitude of each channel for various error metrics . in section",
    "[ sec : thresholds ] we present our level-1 pseudo - threshold values for the steane [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] code under our model error channels .",
    "we compute the pseudo - threshold based on the different error metrics .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude and we discuss open questions and future directions .",
    "we are interested in understanding why , at the logical error - corrected level , pauli channels provide exceptionally good approximations to incoherent error channels , but in general a poor one for coherent ones .",
    "our analysis is based on the effective 1-qubit process matrix for the whole circuit , including the encoding , occurrence of error , syndrome measurement , error correction , and decoding .",
    "this strategy is motivated by the observation that in our simulation scheme the final state of the quantum circuit is always completely localized on the logical codespace , so that the overall circuit can be compactly represented by a 1-qubit process matrix .    for perfect ec , after the stabilizer measurement and correction ,",
    "it is evident that the final state will live in the logical codespace .",
    "in general , this will not be the case when the ec is faulty , since errors during the measurement of the stabilizers will cause the logical state to not be projected perfectly onto the code subspaces .",
    "however , in our previous analysis @xcite , after faulty ec we always perform one round of perfect ec , to account exclusively for uncorrectable errors .",
    "this has the effect of completely projecting the final state onto the codespace .",
    "effective noise channels at the logical ec level have been previously employed to study the entanglement in encoded quantum systems @xcite and the error - suppressing properties of the five - qubit code @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in the low error rate limit , where it is appropriate to taylor - expand each entry in the process matrix in terms of powers of the error rate .",
    "this helps us visualize in a very clear way which terms are more important in determining the relevant characteristics of a given error channel .",
    "as an example , consider a 1-qubit coherent error channel consisting of a rotation about the @xmath3 axis by an angle @xmath4 : @xmath5    in the normalized pauli basis @xmath6 , the process matrix for this channel is : @xmath7    in the small error limit ( @xmath8 ) , this becomes : @xmath9    the pauli twirled approximation to this channel is given by the diagonal entries of its process matrix : @xmath10    which corresponds to a channel where the qubit is flipped with a probability @xmath11 : @xmath12    for illustrative purposes , imagine the situation where we use the 3-qubit bit flip code ( with stabilizers generated by @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "we perfectly encode our qubit , then 3 independent error instances happen , 1 on each qubit , and finally we perfectly measure the stabilizer generators , correct , and decode . if the individual errors correspond to flips with probability @xmath15 , the effective channel for the whole circuit is given by : @xmath16    this channel is still a probabilistic application of an @xmath3 operator .",
    "the first kraus operator corresponds to the situation where either no flip or 1 flip occurred .",
    "the second kraus operator accounts for the case where 2 or 3 flips occurred , thus causing a logical @xmath3 error .",
    "if @xmath11 , this channel s reduced process matrix is : @xmath17 here we have only focused on the first 2 rows and columns of the 1-qubit process matrix .",
    "( all the other entries are @xmath18 . )",
    "on the other hand , if the 3 independent errors are coherent rotations about the @xmath3 axis by an angle @xmath4 , the effective reduced process matrix for the whole circuit is : @xmath19^{3/2 } \\\\ -i 8   [ p_{x } ( 1-p_{x})]^{3/2 }   & 2p_{x}^{3 } + 6(1-p_{x } ) p_{x}^{2 } \\end{pmatrix } \\ ] ] interestingly , for a circuit where the errors are the pauli twirled approximation to the coherent channels , the effective process matrix for the whole circuit still matches the diagonal entries perfectly . however , it is completely unable to match the off - diagonal entries . in the limit of small error ,",
    "this becomes : @xmath20    at the physical level , the process matrix for the @xmath21 channel has diagonal entries proportional to @xmath22 and off - diagonal entries proportional to @xmath4 . at the logical level with perfect ec ,",
    "the leading orders get supressed and the effective process matrix now has diagonal entries proportional to @xmath23 and off - diagonal ones proportional to @xmath24 . in this case , the pauli twirled approximation underestimates the magnitude of the error by 1 power of @xmath4 both at the physical and logical levels .",
    "we have followed the same exact full - density - matrix procedure explained in @xcite to compute the final states after error correction with the steane code . because of the size of the density matrices and the time it takes to cover all the possible syndrome branches , we are unable to obtain symbolic expressions for the effective 1-qubit process matrices . instead , we use quantum process tomography @xcite to reconstruct the numerical process matrix for various error strengths and subsequently fit each entry to a polynomial to determine the leading order and its coefficient .",
    "we test several polynomial fits and select the one with the smallest total variance . in every case ,",
    "the relative variance ( variance divided by the value of the leading order coefficient ) was less than @xmath25 . throughout the paper",
    ", we will refer to the effective 1-qubit process matrix simply as the process matrix at the logical level .",
    "we report the error magnitude for each channel and its approximations using 3 different metrics : the average error rate ( average fidelity error ) , the average trace distance , and the diamond distance .",
    "each one of these has a particular importance in our analysis . the average error rate @xcite is the measure of choice when experimentally characterizing quantum gates and it can be efficiently calculated in the laboratory @xcite . usually in the literature , the error rate is defined with respect to an ideal gate @xmath26 . throughout the paper , the ideal gate @xmath26 will always be the identity .",
    "there is no loss of generality with this assumption , since it is equivalent to an interaction picture where the error channel @xmath27 actually corresponds to the discrepancy channel between the real operation and the ideal gate .",
    "we define the average error rate , @xmath28 , for a noise process @xmath27 as : @xmath29 where the average is defined over the space of pure states , and a general state , @xmath30 , was defined as @xmath31 . in this paper , we follow the more recent convention and define the fidelity as @xmath32 . ] .",
    "whenever possible , we use the process matrix to analytically integrate over the bloch sphere surface and obtain the exact expressions for both the average and the standard deviation . for the cases where the exact symbolic expressions are challenging to compute , we select 150 uniformly distributed states on the surface of the bloch sphere and integrate numerically .",
    "more specifically , we perform the following procedure :    1 .   for a given initial state ,",
    "compute the error rate ( fidelity error ) at 3 different error strengths . 2 .",
    "test several polynomial fits , select the one with the smallest total variance , and store the coefficient of the leading order .",
    "3 .   repeat this for each one of the 150 initial states .",
    "calculate the average and the standard deviation of the set of 150 leading order coefficients .",
    "the average trace distance for the error channel @xmath27 is defined as : @xmath33 once again , the average is calculated analytically whenever possible or numerically by following the procedure described above .",
    "the trace distance is important because in our previous work @xcite we have used it to distinguish between honest and dishonest approximations to error channels .",
    "finally , as a worst - case measure with several useful properties , the diamond distance is the preferred metric in the context of fault tolerance @xcite .",
    "the diamond distance between channels @xmath27 and @xmath34 is defined as : @xmath35 where , as mentioned before , the channel @xmath34 will always be taken as the identity . for a channel acting on a vector space of dimension @xmath36 , the 1-norm",
    "is maximized over a vector space of dimension @xmath37 . for a linear operator @xmath38",
    ", the 1-norm is defined as : @xmath39\\ ] ]    to find the coefficient of the leading order term in the diamond distance , we follow the same procedure described previously : we test several polynomial fits and select the one with the smallest total variance .",
    "to compute the diamond distance we use qetlab s diamond norm function @xcite .",
    "all the other calculations are done with our own python - based software tools .      in our previous work",
    ", we introduced several classically tractable noise models @xcite .",
    "these noise models correspond to kraus channels where each operator is efficiently simulable in the stabilizer formalism .",
    "the free parameters in our noise models are the probabilities associated with the kraus operators . to approximate a target channel ,",
    "we minimize the hilbert - schmidt distance @xcite between the process matrices of the classically tractable noise model and the target channel .",
    "for each target non - clifford error channel , we study two different models : ( a ) the pauli channels ( pc ) , which employ only single - qubit pauli operators , and ( b ) the expanded channels or clifford+measurements channels ( cmc ) , which include all the single - qubit clifford operators and the measurement - induced translations .",
    "when minimizing the hilbert - schmidt distance between channels , we have the option to perform a constrained minimization , in which we enforce that for every initial pure state its trace distance to the resulting state after the target transformation is not greater than its trace distance to the resulting state after the model transformation .",
    "approximate channels that satisfy this condition are referred to as honest , since they do not underestimate the magnitude of the target error .",
    "we label unconstrained approximations as `` a '' and constrained ones as `` w '' . finally , we also include in our analysis the depolarizing channel ( dc ) , a pauli channel where the probabilities of the @xmath3 , @xmath40 , and @xmath0 operators are equal .",
    "the approximations are summarized in table [ table : channels_summary ] .",
    ".summary of the various target and approximate channels . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : threshold_rhc ]    tables [ table : threshold_rzc ] and [ table : threshold_rhc ] present the level-1 pseudo - threshold for the rzc and the rhc and their corresponding approximations , respectively . the pseudo - thresholds are given in terms of the over - rotation angle , @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : rzc_fidelity ] shows how the average error rate scales with the over - rotation angle for the rzc .",
    "figure [ fig : rzc_diamond ] shows the scaling of the diamond distance .",
    "the level-1 pseudo - threshold trends are very different for coherent channels .",
    "the pca gives an overly optimistic estimate of the pseudo - threshold .",
    "the pcw and the expanded channels give an overly pessimistic pseudo - threshold .",
    "this holds for every error metric used .",
    "in contrast to the incoherent case , none of our approximations predicts the pseudo - threshold accurately , although we can bound the pseudo - threhsold .",
    "the pca will always give an upper bound , while the pcw and expanded channels will always give a lower bound .",
    "notice , however , that this lower bound is not useful at all if we employ the average error rate as our metric . in this case , the pseudo - threshold given by the pcw and the expanded approximations is exactly 0 .",
    "when the error is quantified by the average trace distance and the diamond distance , the lower bound is tighter .    for coherent channels , the level-1 pseudo - threshold quantified by the diamond distance is 1 order of magnitude higher than the one quantified by the average error rate .",
    "this is quite unexpected , since the assumption is that the threshold value given by the diamond distance would actually be lower than the one given by the average error rate , because the diamond distance is a worst - case measure .",
    "intuitively , this is a consequence of the average error rate being very small ( @xmath41 ) and the diamond distance being considerably larger ( @xmath42 ) at the physical level . at the logical level",
    ", the diamond distance is still larger than the average error rate , but by a smaller amount .",
    "this can be observed on figure [ fig : rzc_real_f_d ] .",
    "the appreciate how the different scalings cause a huge discrepancy between the two pseudo - thresholds , it is convenient to normalize the error magnitude at the logical level by the error magnitude at the physical level .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : rzc_f_d_norm ] .",
    "since we are normalizing by the respective error magnitude at the physical level , both curves at this level become equal to 1 and the curves at the logical level become quadratic in @xmath4 .",
    "obtained from the diamond distance is about 1 order of magnitude higher than the one obtained from the average error rate , as can be seen on table [ table : threshold_rzc ] . ]",
    "we have computed the physical process ( @xmath2 ) matrix and the effective 1-qubit process ( @xmath2 ) matrix at the first level of ec with the steane [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] code for different incoherent and coherent error models in the limit of low noise . for incoherent errors , at the logical level , the off - diagonal terms decay faster than the diagonal terms , which explains the high accuracy of the pca for incoherent channels . on the other hand , for coherent errors ,",
    "the off - diagonal terms , stronger than the diagonal ones at the physical level , remain stronger at the logical level .",
    "this implies that the pca approximation ( and any stochastic approximation that matches the average fidelity at the physical level ) to coherent channels will unavoidably underestimate the error magnitude at the logical level . on the other hand , a stochastic channel that matches ( or does not underestimate ) a distance - based measure at the physical level will result in an approximation that is too pessimistic at the logical level .",
    "these trends provide bounds on the pseudo - threshold of coherent channels , but these are not very tight .",
    "we have also observed that for coherent channels , the level-1 pseudo - threshold depends strongly on the error measure employed . however , distance - based measures result in considerably higher pseudo - thresholds than the average fidelity .    as several authors have shown @xcite , a characteristic feature of stochastic noise",
    "is that the diamond distance scales linearly with the average error rate . in contrast , for coherent noise the diamond distance scales like the square root of the average error rate .",
    "as we can see from the effective process matrices at the logical level , if the physical noise is unitary , at the first level of concatenation , the effective noise has @xmath24 off - diagonals terms and @xmath23 diagonal terms .",
    "this means that diamond distance scales like @xmath43 .",
    "the scaling of this exponent as a function of the level of concatenation or the code distance remains an open question .",
    "we have examined channels that are either coherent or incoherent while in reality most channels contain both aspects @xcite . for the unitary error models considered ,",
    "the errors can be completely removed by dynamic - decoupling techniques @xcite . in general ,",
    "open - loop control techniques can be used to transform error channels that have a larger coherent character into errors that have less coherent character @xcite . at the gate level",
    "the addition of pauli twirling gates @xcite can also reduce the coherent noise . given the negative effect of coherent errors on the pseudothreshold",
    ", we expect these coherent noise reducing methods will be essential for achieving logical qubits that outperform physical qubits .",
