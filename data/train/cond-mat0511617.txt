    "the stated brownian dynamics is governed by the langevin equation @xmath0 where m is the mass of the brownian particle , @xmath1 is the friction coefficient , u(x ) is the confining potential , f(x , t ) is the periodic driving force with a period @xmath2 and f(x , t ) = f(x , t+@xmath2 ) .",
    "thermal fluctuations are modeled by the zero mean @xmath3-correlated white noise @xmath4 i.e. @xmath5 = 0 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the boltzmann constant and t is the temperature . our goal is to show that , on time scales larger than @xmath2 , the dynamics can be mapped onto a modified langevin dynamics in which the periodic forcing is absent but the potential u(x ) can be replaced by a suitable effective potential @xmath9 .",
    "the methdology we follow is based on kapitsa s treatment for high frequency oscillating field in parametric oscillations @xcite .",
    "we derive the form of the effective potential upto second order in @xmath10 ( expansion parameter which is basically inverse of the square of the oscillating frequency ) in sec.iii .",
    "+ we also study the transport properties and diffusion coefficient for ratchet like systems .",
    "the corresponding langevin dynamics is governed by the equation @xmath11 where v(x ) is the periodic potential with period l i.e. v(x ) = v(x+l ) and the prime denotes 1st derivative of v(x ) with respect to x. in our case @xmath12 and @xmath13 throughout this work .",
    "we define the above dynamics as the original dynamics .",
    "following kapitsa s treatment we derive in the sequel an effective potential for which the dynamics is governed by the equation @xmath14    the first basic quantity of interest in the transport process is the average particle current defined as @xmath15 the other quantity of important interest is the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath16 exact analytical results for d are known for two special cases .",
    "first in the absence of the periodic potential we have the famous einstein s relation @xmath17 .",
    "second is the case in which the external field @xmath18 is absent .",
    "calculation of the diffusion coefficient in the presence of both externally applied space - dependent periodic force and arbitrary periodic potential is not analytically possible .",
    "hence we solve eq.(2 ) and eq.(3 ) numerically . to compute x(t )",
    "we need to transform eq.(2 ) and eq.(3 ) into dimensionless langevin equations as follows : @xmath19 where eq.(6 ) denotes original dynamics , whereas eq.(7 ) is for effective dynamics . in writing the above equations we define the following dimensionless quantities :    1 .",
    "the rescaled friction coefficient @xmath20 which is the ratio of the two characteristic time scales , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath21 is determined from newton s equation @xmath23 , by balancing the two forces @xmath24 yielding @xmath25 , whereas @xmath26 , 2 .",
    "the rescaled potential @xmath27 , assuming period 1 and barrier height @xmath28 , 3 .",
    "the rescaled force strength @xmath29 with the frequency @xmath30 , 4 .",
    "the rescaled white noise forces @xmath31 obeying + @xmath32 with rescaled noise intensity @xmath33 .",
    "as mentioned earlier our focus is on the result that on time scales larger than the period of perturbation , the dynamics is equivalent to one in which the time dependent periodic perturbation can be replaced by a time independent effective potential @xcite . in sarkar and dattagupta @xcite , it has been shown in great detail that the expression of the effective potential does not alter in the presence of noise .",
    "we presume and verify that this result is true even when the forcing term is space dependent .",
    "further , unlike @xcite we treat the underdamped case from which all the results of @xcite can be obtained as a limit . +      it is evident from the nature of the field in which the particle moves that it will traverse a smooth path and at the same time will execute small noisy fluctuations about that path . accordingly",
    ", we represent the function x(t ) as a sum : @xmath34 where x(t ) is a slow variable and @xmath35 is a fast variable .",
    "the following transformations then follow : @xmath36 now setting the noise term to zero and putting the above transformations in eq.(1 ) we obtain @xmath37 to find the effective potential experienced by the particle correct to first order , we perform a taylor series expansion of eq.(10 ) upto first order .",
    "thus , @xmath38 the above eq.(11 ) involves both ` fluctuating ' and ` smooth ' terms on the left and right sides which must be separately equal . for the fluctuating terms we can simply put @xmath39 where we take @xcite @xmath40 . solving eq.(12 )",
    "we obtain , @xmath41 since @xmath42 is large , @xmath43 is effective .",
    "next combining eq.(12 ) with eq.(11 ) and then averaging over a time period we finally obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 with the help of eq.(15 ) we can rewrite eq.(14 ) as follows @xmath46 or , @xmath47 with @xmath48 , where @xmath49 it is clear that @xmath50 vanishes for space - independent forcing .      to find the second order correction term in the effective potential the transformation equations given in eq.(9 ) have to be modified as @xmath51 putting the above transformation in eq.(1 ) and retaining terms upto seond order in @xmath10 ( o@xmath52 ) we derive @xmath53 next , after performing time averaging",
    "we ultimately obtain @xmath54 with @xmath55 , where u(x ) is the systematic periodic potential , @xmath56 is the first order correction to the effective potential given by eq.(18 ) and the second order correction to the effective potential is given by @xmath57 these results are identical to those obtained by dutta and barma @xcite who have however employed a fokker - planck equation approach . in the next section",
    "we further extend this analysis by using these results for calculating the effective diffusion enhancement and transport current .",
    "we numerically solve the following two dimensionless equations of motion @xmath58 with the aid of the heun scheme which is basically the runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "our main interest as emphasized earlier is to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient which is defined as @xmath59 where the two brackets respectively denote averages over the initial conditions of position and velocity and over all realizations of thermal noise .",
    "we calculate this quantity for the orginal dynamics and effective dynamics for the two special cases : ( a ) space dependent external periodic force and ( b ) constant amplitude external periodic force .",
    "the results are shown in fig.3 .    in both the cases the enhancement of effective diffusion coefficient as a function of the amplitude ` a",
    "' is clearly noticeable .",
    "the important difference is that the enhancement is much more pronounced for the space dependent external periodic force than the constant amplitude external periodic force .",
    "+ it is known that there are two states of a driven brownian dynamical system : the locked states , in which the particle stays inside one potential well , and the running states , for which the particle runs over the potential barriers .",
    "the first regime is characteristic of a small driving force strength .",
    "when the amplitude of the external field is made large , running states appear where we can see both diffusive and regular behavior of the particle .",
    "we have shown above that the effective diffusion coefficient increases rapidly when the externally applied force exceeds a certain critical strength .",
    "this leads to the existence of an optimal  a \" for the enhancement of diffusion rate .",
    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of stochastic resonance ( sr ) @xcite .",
    "so we can hereby employ the acronym  sr \" to imply accelaration of diffusion . by this",
    "we mean that a new diffusion mechanism , with combined action of noise , spacially periodic potential and time - periodic modulation can be more effective than that of a free brownian motion , since @xmath60 is shown to exceed unity in a large region around some optimal parameter regions . in these regions the optimal matching of the periodic force and the noise drive the particles up to the potential hills from where they scatter at the potential barriers and finally diffuse very quickly into wide regions . for small ` a '",
    "it is very difficult to push them up to the potential hills .",
    "therefore , in order to get the above mentioned diffusion enhancement we need the optimal collective actions of three forces : spatially periodic gradients , time - periodic modulation and stochastic stimulation .",
    "further we should emphasize that the extra terms in effective potentials due to space dependence of the external force do indeed aid this diffusion enhancement mechanism .",
    "+ we have also studied the current ` j ' which is defined as the time average of the average velocity over an ensemble of initial conditions .",
    "thus it involves two different averages , the first is over m initial conditions , which we take randomly centered around the origin and with an initial velocity equal to zero . for fixed time @xmath61",
    "we calculate the average velocity @xmath62 .",
    "the second average is over time and yields @xmath63 .",
    "all quantities of interest are averaged over 250 different trajectories and @xmath64 periods .",
    "there are three dimensionless parameters a , b and @xmath42 defined earlier in terms of physical quantities .",
    "we vary the parameter a and fix @xmath65 and @xmath66 throughout . in fig.4 we have shown the behavior of the transport currents in case of space dependent external force . initially the current is zero , following which it increases and peaks at some optimal values of ` a ' , then decreases with the increase of ` a ' .",
    "the following explanation will help to understand the behavior of current . at very low force strength ,",
    "escape jumps between the neighbouring wells are very rare i.e. the average directed current is very small .    the input energy is mostly expanded into the kinetic energy of the intrawell motion and eventually dissipates . as ` a '",
    "is increased further , the brownian motor mechanism starts to work and some part of energy contributes to the net motion of the particle .",
    "now due to inertia , the mean velocity increases and reaches a maximum . then ` a ' reaches a second threshold value above which the current starts to decrease because of the debilitating effect of the ratchet potential .",
    "the occurrence of multiple reversals of the directed current , as is shown in the inset of fig.4 , is an interesting feature of the inertial brownian motor system @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of current reversals can be described by different stability properties of the perturbed rotating orbits of the system @xcite .",
    "+    by comparing the figures ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) we can surmise that the current is much more substantial for the space dependent external force case . extra terms in the effective potential arising from space dependence of the external force does help in increasing the current .",
    "in this section we present an overview of the principal results of this paper .",
    "we have addressed the problem of underdamped brownian particle in a position dependent periodic driving force in the high frequency regime .",
    "we have then calculated the effective potential upto second order in the expansion parameter @xmath10 and used these results to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient and transport current . in the high frequency regime",
    "the particle makes small but rapid excursions around a smooth path along which the motion is relatively slow .",
    "a systematic perturbative treatment in powers of the excursion amplitude shows that the first order correction in the effective potential exists only if the externally applied rapidly oscillating field is space dependent .",
    "this first order correction term ( eq.(18 ) ) is the average kinetic energy which contributes to the work done against damping .",
    "the second order correction to the effective potential shows that a nontrivial contribution arises even for position independent driving .",
    "+ we have employed our derived results for the calculation of the effective diffusion coefficient and transport current .",
    "we obtained the effective diffusion coefficient by solving both the orginal dynamics and effective dynamics .",
    "we noted a giant enhancement of diffusion and the results arising from original and effective dynamics agree very well .",
    "this validates our method of calculation in the high frequency regime .",
    "the enhancement of diffusion is a result of the optimal collective actions of spatially periodic gradients , time periodic modulation and thermal noise .",
    "the enhancement is much more pronounced for the space dependent periodic external force which can be understood in terms of the extra terms arising in the effective potential from the space dependence of external force .",
    "we have analyzed the transport properties and the behavior of current for the brownian motor mechanism and compared the currents for two cases : space dependent and space independent external forces .",
    "the current is much larger for the space dependent case .",
    "+ finally we would like to emphasize once again the practical implications of this work .",
    "the parameters specifying the particles enter the effective potential , which can be used to separate different species of brownian particles by identifying the minima of the effective potential .",
    "one can control the diffusion rates by varying periodic spatial gradients and the space dependent external field .",
    "in addition to myriad applications mentioned earlier , systems described by eq.(1 ) are realized for charged particles moving on thermal surfaces under periodic potentials subjected to time varying fields .",
    "recent motivation to study these systems has been inspired by the theoretical modeling of the molecules called kinesin and myosin , which posess the ability to move unidirectionally along structural filaments of microtutubulin and actin .",
