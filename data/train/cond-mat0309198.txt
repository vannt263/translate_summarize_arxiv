    "the medial graph ( or the surrounding lattice ) @xmath56 of a triangular lattice @xmath56 is the kagome lattice shown in fig .",

    "on the other hand , it is also known that by taking an appropriate @xmath64 limit the potts partition function generates spanning trees @xcite .",
    "write the spanning tree generating function in a slightly more general form by attaching a weight @xmath65 to each line segment of the tree .",
    "since the number of lines in a spanning tree on an @xmath2-vertex graph is fixed at @xmath7 , this merely adds an overall factor @xmath66 .",
    "then , the equivalence reads @xcite @xmath67 the equivalences ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) hold quite generally for finite lattices , provided that appropriate vertex weights are defined for the boundary @xcite .",
    "we next combine ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) and take the thermodynamic limit @xmath68 . assuming the two limits on @xmath2 and @xmath57 commute",
    ", this leads to @xmath69 where @xmath70 we note in passing that the vertex weights in ( [ e3 ] ) now satisfy the free - fermion condition @xcite @xmath71 so @xmath72 can be evaluated by standard means such as using pfaffians @xcite .",
    "this verifies the integral expression of @xmath0 given in ( [ tri ] ) .    alternately , using a mapping introduced by lin @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the kagome ice - rule model can be mapped into an ice - rule model on the triangular lattice .",
    "the trick is to shrink each shaded face of the kagome lattice into a point as shown in fig .",
    "this results in a 20-vertex ice - rule model on the triangular lattice which has 3 arrows in and 3 arrows out at every vertex .",
    "there are 4 different vertex types in the 20-vertex model : ( i ) six vertices in which the 3 incoming arrows are adjacent , ( ii ) two vertices in which the incoming and outgoing arrows alternate around the vertex , ( iii ) six vertices in which 2 incoming arrows are adjacent while the third in - arrow points in a direction opposite to _ one _ of the 2 adjacent incoming arrows , and",
    "( iv ) six vertices in which 2 incoming arrows are adjacent while the third in - arrow points opposite to the _ other _ adjacent incoming arrow .",
    "these 4 configurations are shown in the left - side column in fig . 3 to which we assign respective energies @xmath73 .",
    "the other 16 ice - rule configurations are obtained by rotations .    the shrinking processes from which these ice - rule configurations are deduced",
