    "the high - velocity winds from quasars are important for several related reasons .",
    "first , these winds can significantly affect observed quasar properties via , e.g. , ultraviolet ( uv ) line absorption , high - ionization line emission , optical / uv reddening , and absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "second , wind absorption lines are observed frequently , indicating that winds have a high covering factor and are a substantial part of quasar nuclear regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "third , winds might improve the efficiency of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) by removing angular momentum from the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , winds can evacuate gas from the host galaxy , perhaps shaping smbh growth and galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strongest absorption lines created by quasar winds are broad absorption line ( bal ) troughs with velocity widths greater than 2000  km  s@xmath0 and typical outflow velocities of ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "many bals are believed to be formed in an equatorial wind that is launched from the accretion disk at light days from the smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the bals are formed in the vicinity of the launching region , then the timescale for wind material to cross the region of interest is about , and this is a reasonable characteristic timescale over which flow structures might be expected to change .",
    "this is also the characteristic timescale for significant angular rotation of the accretion disk at the wind - launching radius .",
    "assessments of the transverse velocities of bal material indicate these are often comparable to the aforementioned outflow velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and characteristic variability timescales of years are again deduced for material moving transversely through our line - of - sight .",
    "thus , studies of multi - year bal variability can provide useful insights into the nature of quasar winds .",
    "the existence of bal variability has been known for over two decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early investigations of this phenomenon were generally single - object studies with observational epochs , although @xcite performed an early spectroscopic monitoring survey of 23 bal quasars .",
    "in recent years , systematic sample - based studies of bal variability , investigating 530 objects , have become increasingly common ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "sample - based studies have the advantage of allowing broadly applicable and statistically reliable conclusions about bal variability to be drawn .",
    "bal variability has been found to be a complex and diverse phenomenon . generally , changes in the residual flux in portions of bal troughs are observed , while detections of bal acceleration / deceleration are much rarer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ". our final sample will include @xmath1  2100 bal quasars with high - quality spectra providing multi - year variability coverage in the rest frame ; this size is about two orders of magnitude larger than other samples being used to investigate multi - year bal variability ( see table  [ varet1 ] ) . in @xcite",
    "we presented some first results from the survey focused on c  iv bal disappearance events . in this paper , we provide more general findings regarding the variability of c  iv and si  iv bal troughs , primarily on multi - year timescales but also extending to much shorter timescales . these findings are based upon 291 bal quasars selected from our full sample to have particularly high - quality spectroscopic coverage of these troughs ; 428 distinct c  iv and 235 distinct si  iv troughs are utilized .",
    "our overall approach is first to characterize systematically how bal troughs vary on multi - year timescales and then to use this characterization to derive physical implications for bal outflows .",
    "for example , our results provide insights into the radial distance where most bal troughs are formed , the lifetimes of bal troughs along our line of sight , the connection between bal disappearance / emergence events and general bal variability , and the driving mechanisms of bal variability .    in section  [ os2 ] we describe the observations and sample selection underlying this work , and in section  [ dpa2 ]",

    "the canonical definition of bal troughs ( see equation  [ eeqv1 ] ) was developed for the purpose of finding bal troughs in a single - epoch spectrum .",

    "after an automated identification of bal troughs using our algorithm above , we visually inspect all the available spectra of each main - sample quasar .",
    "the inspection shows that our approach for bal - trough identification is appropriately implemented for both civ and siiv bal troughs .",
    "we found that , in the majority of cases , the complex would be identified as a single bal trough under the canonical definition in at least one of our epochs .",
    "moreover , our adopted bal - trough definition produces the same results as the canonical definition for non - merging and non - splitting bal troughs that lie between constant @xmath41 and @xmath40 in all the available spectral observations . using our adopted bal - trough definition we identified a total of 428 distinct civ and 235 distinct siiv bal troughs in the 699 main - sample spectra .",

    "therefore , we assume each bal trough evolved with the same number of steps over a time @xmath193  yr ( i.e. , the mean of the sampled timescales in this interval ) . the @xmath94ew distribution for civ bal - trough variations on 2.02.5  yr timescales is shown in figure  [ varf9 ] .",
    "a random - walk model produces a binomial distribution for @xmath94ew determined by two parameters : the number of steps , @xmath105 , and the size of each step , @xmath194 . to determine the random - walk model that best matches our data",
    ", we produced a set of binomial distributions using different numbers of steps and step sizes , and performed a @xmath195 test between our data and each distribution . a random - walk model with @xmath196 and @xmath197   yields the minimum @xmath195 for civ bal troughs on timescales of 2.02.5  yr .",
    "the best - fitting parameters suggest that civ bal troughs in this model tend to evolve in a small number of steps on 2.02.5  yr timescales .",
    "figure  [ varf9 ] shows the binomial distribution that best matches the @xmath94ew distribution .",
    "the for the best - fitting model indicates that the data are consistent with the random - walk model .",
    "we calculate confidence intervals for the model parameters using numerical @xmath34 confidence - region estimation for two parameters of interest ( see section   15.6.5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure  [ varf10 ] ,",
    "we show confidence intervals of 68.3% , 90% , and 99% for two parameters of interest .",
    "the best - fitting fixed time step is @xmath198  days ; we calculate uncertainties on this parameter at 68.3% confidence .",
    "a binomial distribution produced by a random - walk model closely approximates a gaussian distribution for a large number of steps ( @xmath199 ) ; for a smaller number of steps the binomial distribution remains non - gaussian .",
    "consistent with the fact that the @xmath94ew distribution for civ bal troughs on 2.02.5  yr timescales is non - gaussian ( see section  [ vdist ] ) , the results in figure  [ varf10 ] show that our data on the @xmath94ew distribution for civ bal troughs reject any gaussian approximation ( i.e. , large values of @xmath105 are disfavored ) . as for the @xmath94ew distributions in section  [ vdist ]",
    ", the binomial model distribution also has a stronger central peak compared to the gaussian approximation .",
    "similarly , we use a random - walk model to describe the evolution of siiv bal - trough ews .",
    "the best - fitting model parameters for siiv bal - trough ew variations on timescales of 2.02.5  yr are @xmath196 and @xmath200   with .",
    "the best random - walk model parameters for both civ and siiv bal troughs are almost identical ; this result is broadly consistent with the correlated civ and siiv bal - trough variations discussed in section  [ csibal ] .",
    "using the best - fitting random - walk model ( @xmath201 , @xmath202   ) calculated for civ bal - trough ew variations on timescales of 2.02.5 yr , we simulated ew variations for a sample of civ troughs ; we selected the simulated sample to have the same size as our main sample ( 428 ) .",
    "figure  [ varf11 ] shows a comparison between the simulations and observed ew variations on timescales of 5.9 hr to 3.7 yr .",
    "given that the fixed time step is larger than the shorter timescales sampled by our data , we randomly select the start time of each simulated trough and preserved @xmath203  days for each step . as can be seen in figure  [ varf11 ] , the best - fitting random - walk model on timescales of 2.02.5 yr appears to represent acceptably the range of ew variations on a larger range of timescales .",
    "we also compared sliding - window standard deviation curves computed for the data and the model .",
    "these curves are consistent on timescales of 1001400 days , and on shorter timescales the data are too limited for proper comparison .",
    "the simple random - walk model examined above should only be considered to be an approximation of a more complex reality ; e.g. , bal ews surely do not evolve via discrete steps after remaining constant for a fixed interval .",
    "nevertheless , the basic apparent success of this model suggests that some of its features are of importance .",
    "for example , the derived characteristic timescale of @xmath204  days may represent the length of time that bal ews tend to increase / decrease monotonically .",
    "this timescale also suggests that the distribution of bal ew values will only approximate a gaussian for monitoring periods of @xmath205  yr in the rest frame .",
    "our large sample has allowed us to establish , beyond question , the coordinated variability of multiple troughs in quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is found for both civ and siiv troughs ; e.g. , for civ the derived probability of this phenomenon being due to chance is @xmath206 .",
    "our investigations of coordinated multi - trough variability show that it is present even for velocity offsets as large as .",
    "coordinated multi - trough variability might appear somewhat surprising in the context of quasar - wind models ( see section  [ vintro ] ) , and it can provide insights into the drivers of bal variability more generally .",
    "absorption troughs at widely separated velocities should be formed in outflow streamlines that are widely physically separated and thus largely unrelated .",
    "some mechanism capable of acting over a wide range of radii must be present to enforce the coordinated multi - trough variability .",
    "consideration of current quasar - wind models suggests a possible enforcement mechanism is substantial changes in the amount of `` shielding gas '' along the line - of - sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the shielding gas prevents bal outflows from being overionized by nuclear extreme uv ( euv ) and x - ray photons ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "shielding - gas variability is likely according to quasar - wind simulations , and it may have been detected in a couple of bal quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it can arise due to internal gas motions and/or accretion - disk rotation at the relatively small radii where the shielding gas is located .",
    "changes in the column density of shielding gas can increase or decrease the level of ionizing euv / x - ray radiation reaching the bal wind . in response to this variation , absorption components at different velocities can rise or fall in ionization level together , leading to coordinated multi - trough variations . ) .",
    "] of course , this same mechanism might be applicable to single - trough bal quasars as well and thus much of bal variability in general .    one method for testing",
    "this scenario would be to examine the continuum variability of quasars showing coordinated multi - trough variations .",
    "ideally one would measure the relevant euv / x - ray ionizing continuum directly , but measurements of the more straightforwardly accessible rest - frame uv continuum might suffice .",
    "unfortunately , limitations in the spectrophotometric calibration of the boss spectra do not allow this test to be implemented straightforwardly at present , but it should be possible in the future as boss calibration efforts proceed @xcite .",
    "it is also perhaps possible that euv / x - ray luminosity variations could primarily drive the bal variability rather than shielding - gas variations .",
    "this would require that some euv / x - ray radiation is not blocked from reaching the wind by the shielding gas .",
    "we have studied the variability of civ and siiv bal troughs using a systematically observed sample of 291 bal quasars .",
    "we have utilized 699 high - quality spectra of these quasars obtained by sdss - i / ii and boss .",
    "the main basic observational results of our study are the following :    1 .   using a bal - trough definition designed for the investigation of trough variability in multi - epoch observations , we have identified 428 distinct civ and 235 distinct siiv bal troughs in the multi - epoch spectra of our 291 `` main - sample '' quasars . the sampled rest - frame timescales range between 5.9  hr and 3.7  yr with a median of 2.1  yr . see section  [ bal2 ] .",
    "we identify variable bal troughs using two different approaches and find , consistent with earlier work , that bal variability is common on multi - year timescales . about % of both civ and siiv bal troughs",
    "detectably vary on rest - frame timescales of  yr .",
    "our large sample size also allows us to quantify the fraction of bals that vary by a given amount in ew .",
    "the cumulative fraction of bal troughs varying by a given @xmath71ew@xmath72 threshold drops with increasing @xmath71ew@xmath72 , but it remains significant even for @xmath71ew@xmath72 values as large as 5   .",
    "see sections  [ vr2 ] and [ vfrac ] .",
    "civ bal variability is found across a wide range of outflow velocity .",
    "the percentage of civ bal regions showing variability remains relatively constant at % at velocities from @xmath76  km  s@xmath0 to @xmath82  km  s@xmath0 , and it then rises at higher velocities .",
    "the dependence of siiv bal variability upon outflow velocity is more difficult to constrain owing to contamination by unrelated emission lines .",
    "see section  [ vfrac ] .",
    "4 .   we show , consistent with earlier work , that civ and siiv bal variations usually occur in relatively narrow portions of bal troughs ( i.e. , troughs do not vary monolithically in depth ) .",

    "see section  [ csibal ] . 10 . our large sample clearly establishes that when a bal quasar shows multiple troughs of the same ion , these troughs usually strengthen or weaken together .",

    "the high observed frequency of bal variability on multi - year timescales is generally supportive of models where most bal absorption arises at radii of light days .",
    "a significant minority of bal troughs are remarkably stable and may be associated with absorption on larger scales .",
    "see section  [ dvar ] .",
    "2 .   our measurements of ew variations as a function of timescale can be used to infer an ( ew - dependent ) average lifetime for a bal trough along our line - of - sight of @xmath210  yr .",

    "such changes in shielding gas may be a driver of bal variability more generally .",
    "see section  [ shield ] .",
    "the ongoing boss ancillary project on quasar - wind variability continues to enlarge the sample of bal quasars with high - quality spectra spanning multiple years , and we hope to obtain an additional epochs of observation for the associated bal quasars as part of the time domain spectroscopic survey ( tdss ) of the sdss - iv . these data should enable multiple further studies of bal variability , and here we highlight a few selected ways that the main results found above might be advanced .",
    "first , in this paper we have focused upon variability of the relatively high - ionization transitions of civ and siiv , and it would be worthwhile to extend large - sample analyses to other transitions including mgii , aliii , feii , and feiii ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the outflow structure along the line - of - sight may differ significantly when such lower ionization transitions are present .",
    "second , additional data can improve constraints upon the fraction of bals showing variability , bal lifetimes , and our simple random - walk model for bal ew variability .",
    "ideally , one would also like to test our measurements of bal variability against specific predictions made by advancing models of quasar winds .",
    "third , our results on coordinated trough variability for bal quasars showing multiple troughs indicate that large - scale investigations of bal vs. continuum variability are important to pursue .",
    "continuum variability investigations in the rest - frame uv should be possible once the boss spectrophotometric calibration is improved , and limited x - ray continuum monitoring should be possible with targeted observations and the _ erosita _ all - sky survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "fourth , a large - scale investigation of bal vs. emission - line variability should give unique insights into the quasar - wind contribution to high - ionization line production .",
    "finally , the full utilization ( see section  [ bal2 ] ) and gathering of additional observational epochs will allow assessment of how various types of bal troughs evolve , and perhaps coevolve , over timescales of days - to - years .",
    "additional epochs will also allow a large - scale search for bal acceleration events which have generally proved elusive to date ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we present a detailed investigation of the variability of 428 civ and 235 siiv broad absorption line ( bal ) troughs identified in multi - epoch observations of 291 quasars by the sloan digital sky survey - i / ii / iii . </S>",
    "<S> these observations primarily sample rest - frame timescales of over which significant rearrangement of the bal wind is expected . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a number of observational results on , e.g. , the frequency of bal variability , the velocity range over which bal variability occurs , the primary observed form of bal - trough variability , the dependence of bal variability upon timescale , the frequency of bal strengthening vs. weakening , correlations between bal variability and bal - trough profiles , relations between civ and siiv bal variability , coordinated multi - trough variability , and bal variations as a function of quasar properties . </S>",
    "<S> we assess implications of these observational results for quasar winds . </S>",
    "<S> our results support models where most bal absorption is formed within an order - of - magnitude of the wind - launching radius , although a significant minority of bal troughs may arise on larger scales . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate an average lifetime for a bal trough along our line - of - sight of a few thousand years . </S>",
    "<S> bal disappearance and emergence events appear to be extremes of general bal variability , rather than being qualitatively distinct phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the parameters of a random - walk model for bal ew variability , finding that this model can acceptably describe some key aspects of ew variability . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinated trough variability of bal quasars with multiple troughs suggests that changes in `` shielding gas '' may play a significant role in driving general bal variability . </S>"
