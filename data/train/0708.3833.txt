    "17 has long been known as a moderately bright ( v@xmath3 ) symbiotic star  until recently , undistinguished from many other such systems @xcite(ss73 ) .",
    "rosat observations from 1992 showed the source was a faint ( @xmath4kev@xmath5erg @xmath1s@xmath6 ) soft x - ray source @xcite , but beyond that little was known at uv or higher energies . in 2005 , however , this system was independently discovered to be a hard x - ray source by both integral ( igrj10109 - 5746 ; @xcite ) and swift ( swift j101103.3 - 574814 ; @xcite ) .",
    "before these sources were identified as being associated either with each other or with 17 , we successfully proposed for _",
    "suzaku_observations of the swift source , with the goal of finding potential members of the newly - identified class of `` highly - absorbed x - ray binaries '' discovered by integral @xcite .",
    "our choice of swift j101103.3 - 574814 was driven by its hard x - ray flux , as seen by the swift bat ( @xmath7ergs @xmath1s@xmath6 ) , and its low galactic latitude ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "although @xcite noted that this source is only @xmath9  from gro j1008 - 57 , a transient xrb with a pulse period of 93.6 s , rosat pspc observations which also detected the pulsations confirmed gro j1008 - 57 s position to within @xmath10 @xcite . based on the swift xrt and rosat pspc data , we can be confident that swift j1010.1 - 5747 , igr j10109 - 5746 and 17 are all names for a single symbiotic system that is distinct from gro j1008 - 57 .",
    "a symbiotic star consists of a red giant and a hot blue companion , frequently a white dwarf accreting material from the red giant wind @xcite .",
    "although many symbiotic stars emit soft x - rays @xcite , only small number of those with white dwarf companions are known to emit hard x - rays , including ch cyg @xcite , rt cru @xcite , and t crb @xcite .",
    "in addition to hard x - rays , each of these have also shown optical flares or novae at some point @xcite .",
    "another type of symbiotics , the `` symbiotic low mass x - ray binaries , '' with m giant / neutron star systems such as gx1 + 4 and 4u1954 + 31 @xcite also shows hard x - ray emission , frequently with a periodicity of minutes to hours .",
    "17 is particularly intriguing because it could _ only _  be identified as unusual in hard x - rays , since its soft x - ray emission is nondescript .",
    "its optical emission history is patchy , appearing in catalogs roughly every few decades since its initial listing as cd-57 3057 .",
    "if in fact it has little optical variability , 17 may be first example of a new class of symbiotic / x - ray binary that has a significant hard x - ray flux * without *  significant soft x - ray emission or optical outbursts .",
    "17 was listed as an `` interesting '' star in the ss73 catalog , where it was described as a m3ep + ob binary system .",
    "@xcite noted the star shows balmer lines in emission through h 10 .",
    "subsequently , @xcite obtained spectra from a number of ss73 stars , and identified 17 as a mira - type system , including a normal - type m4 giant star , with emission lines of h@xmath11  and h@xmath12  along with tio absorption bands .",
    "they suggested that henize s observations were likely done at object maximum phase , since they did not see such strong emission lines .",
    "although not observed by iue , the source saturated the swift uvot in all 4 swift observations , with a uvw1 magnitude greater than 11.3 ( based on the quick - look data ) .",
    "the optical survey of variable stars by @xcite found weak evidence for a 577 day period for 17 , with v magnitude variations between 9.68 - 9.89 . unlike other hard x - ray symbiotic systems ( ch cyg , rt cru , t crb )",
    ", 17 has not shown any sign of a optical brightening or `` slow nova '' in its sparse historical record .",
    "the distance to 17 is not known , although it was observed by the hipparcos satellite as part of the tycho catalog .",
    "the measured parallax was @xmath13mas ( @xmath14pc ) , but this value is not credible for an m4iii star with @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite(p.406 ) notes that the absolute v magnitude of mira variables is @xmath16 . for p=577 days",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath17 , or a maximum distance ( assuming no absorption ) of 1 kpc .",
    "the line of sight absorption to 17 is also unknown , but assuming the m giant dominates emission in the j and k bands , @xmath18  and @xmath19 @xcite(p.158 ) , equivalent to n@xmath20@xmath1 , implying a distance of @xmath21pc . finally , 17 is @xmath22mag fainter than the apparently similar ch cyg system ( at @xmath23pc , @xcite ) , suggesting a distance of 500 pc . combining these results",
    ", we estimate 17 s distance to be in the range @xmath24pc .    as noted above , 17 was observed both by the rosat all - sky survey and in a 7 ksec pointed observation , finding a weak source in both cases .",
    "in addition , exosat observed a @xmath25  field containing 17 with the ( non - imaging ) medium energy ( me ) detector ( sequence # 1340 ) , although the data quality was noted as `` poor . ''",
    "we downloaded the standard spectrum and response from the heasarc archive and fit it with xspec to an absorbed bremsstrahlung spectrum as the data quality did not justify a more complex model .",
    "the best - fit model had a flux of @xmath26erg @xmath1s@xmath6  with a temperature greater than 3 kev and @xmath27@xmath1 .",
    "the exosat observation also showed that no source in the field did not show any strong variability during the 5 hour observation .",
    "although we can not be certain the exosat spectrum is from 17 , the spectrum and flux is consistent with that conclusion .",
    "the other other known nearby x - ray source , gro j1008 - 57 , is transient and , when on , was significantly brighter than the exosat source .",
    "17 was observed by _ suzaku_for 20 ksec on june 5 , 2006 ( obsid 01055010 ) .",
    "the pointing direction was chosen to center the source on the hxd detector , which has the effect of reducing the effective area of the xis detectors by 10% due to vignetting .",
    "all four xis detectors were in standard imaging mode .",
    "the data were processed using version 1.2 of the standard _ suzaku_pipeline software .",
    "we extracted all events within @xmath28  of 17 for each of the four xis detectors to create the source spectra .",
    "the lightcurve of both the xis and hxd events showed no sign of flares either in the complete event list or the source events , so all events were kept .",
    "we generated response matrices for the xis detectors using version 2007 - 05 - 14 of xisrmfgen , and used the standard effective area files for hxd - nominal pointings using a 6 mm ( @xmath28 ) extraction circle .",
    "the xis background data was taken from a circular region with no apparent sources that was offset from both the source and the corner calibration sources .",
    "the source was not bright enough to appear in the hxd gso , so we only consider the hxd pin detector in this paper . since the observation was done after the w0 pin diode voltage was reduced to 400v from 500v but before this mode was calibrated , we eliminated these events from our dataset and used only the w123 events .",
    "we then used the pin response matrix appropriate for the w123 diodes , correcting for dead time using the hxddtcor  routine .",
    "we used the pin background events file ( v1.2 ) generated by the suzaku hxd team to make the pin non - x - ray background ( nxb ) spectrum .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background was included in the spectral modeling itself , at the level found by @xcite .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f1.ps    figure  [ fig : spec ] shows 17 s x - ray spectrum as observed by the _",
    "suzaku_xis and hxd and demonstrates its primary features :    1 .   weak emission below 2 kev 2 .   a strongly absorbed hard x - ray spectrum 3 .   three narrow , strong emission lines at 6.38 , 6.66 , and 6.98 kev",
    "_ suzaku _ s energy calibration between 6 - 8 kev is accurate to @xmath29ev @xcite , so the three emission lines can be identified as an iron k fluorescence line as well as fe xxvand fe xxviemission .",
    "however , the exact position and strength of the lines depends upon the shape of the underlying continuum .",
    "in addition to the spectral analysis , we show 17 s lightcurve ( between 2 - 8 kev ) in figure  [ fig : ltcrv ] .",
    "the background - subtracted count rate averaged 0.7 cts / s , fluctuating between 0.5 - 1 cts / s without an apparent period .",
    "this stability is similar to what was seen in the earlier exosat me observation , and suggests that the process generating the x - ray emission ( likely accretion ) is relatively steady .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f2a.ps ( 80mm,80mm)f2b.ps    ( 80mm,80mm)f3a.ps ( 80mm,80mm)f3b.ps    we considered four different models for the x - ray spectrum , based on both a synchrotron ( power law ) origin and a thermal model for the continuum emission .",
    "the synchrotron model assumes that the emission comes from relativistic electrons near the compact object , perhaps emitted as a yet - unseen jet .",
    "in contrast , the thermal model supposes that the emission is due primarily to a hot stream of accreting material falling onto the compact object . in both cases",
    "we added a gaussian to model the iron fluorescence line , which presumably arises from a combination of fluorescence in the absorbing material and scattering from the surface of the hot star or an accretion disk . in the power law model",
    ", we also added two additional gaussians to model the fe xxvand fe xxviemission features . in the thermal model we assumed these latter two lines arose from the plasma itself .",
    "all four models included at least one absorption component ; we also considered models with a second absorber that only partially covered ( noted with `` pc '' in table  [ tab : fits ] ) the source .",
    "this second absorber is motivated by the low interstellar absorption ( @xmath30@xmath1 ) to the mira variable companion , which strongly suggests the x - ray absorption is extremely local to the x - ray source in the binary system .",
    "the soft x - ray emission between 1 - 2 kev is best fit by the partial - covering thermal model , although even this model underpredicts the emission in this band .",
    "however , when the 0.5 - 2 kev band is fit with a simple thermal model absorbed by galactic emission , the total flux is only @xmath31erg @xmath1s@xmath6 .",
    "this soft x - ray flux is an order of magnitude fainter than either the rosat all - sky or pointed observation result , although these are rather uncertain values as only @xmath32total counts were observed @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray variation suggests the partial absorber periodically changes to allow more photons to escape the system , evidence that the local absorber does not enshroud the x - ray source .",
    "our results for all four models are shown in figures  [ fig : spec ] and [ fig : absspec ]  and in tables  [ tab : fits ] and [ tab : fek ] for the model parameters and iron line strengths , respectively .",
    "all quoted errors show 90% confidence intervals . assuming a distance in the range @xmath33kpc",
    ", the @xmath34absorbed flux implies a luminosity of @xmath35erg / s .",
    "the unabsorbed flux depends upon the model used ; in the `` abs pc th '' case , it is @xmath36erg / s .",
    ".spectral fit results [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "@xcite classified 16 symbiotics seen with rosat into three types : ( 1 ) supersoft emission from the atmosphere of the hot star , ( 2 ) emission from an optically - thin plasma with @xmath37kev , or ( 3 ) an ill - defined catch - all of relatively hard x - ray sources .",
    "they found only two sources in class ( 3 ) , the x - ray binary gx1 + 4 and hen 3 - 1591 ( which they suspected might also contain a neutron star ) .",
    "although not in the mrset et al .",
    "( 1997 ) survey , the rosat observation of 17 suggests it would likely have been placed in category ( 2 ) , albeit with some uncertainty due to the large column density ( n@xmath38@xmath1 ) required to fit the rosat data .",
    "however , subsequent x - ray observatories have discovered hard x - rays from the symbiotic systems ch cyg , rt cru , t crb in addition to 17 @xcite whose emission does not fit with the physical mechanisms described by @xcite .",
    "curiously , the x - ray spectrum of 17 above 2 kev appears be quite similar to the polar magnetic cataclysmic variable ( mcv ) star am her .",
    "@xcite fit the 1993 asca observation of am her using an abs pc bremsstrahlung model , finding @xmath39kev with @xmath40% of the source absorbed by a column density of @xmath41@xmath1 , @xmath42% absorbed with a column density of @xmath43@xmath1 , with the remaining area effectively unabsorbed .",
    "the fluorescent iron line equivalent width in this model was @xmath44kev , and the bolometric luminosity of the system was @xmath45ergs / s .",
    "these parameters are quite similar to our abs pc th model , with the ( significant ) change that the 20% moderate absorption seen in am her is 100% in the case of 17 .",
    "of course , unlike the wide separation in symbiotic systems , cvs are close binaries which show classical nova outbursts @xcite . however , the similarity of the hard x - ray emission seen in 17 and am her suggests that the underlying accretion processes are related in this object .",
    "the @xcite study of symbiotic systems seen by the swift bat ( which includes 17 ) showed that these spectra usually showed x - ray absorption that exceeded the optical extinction by orders of magnitude , as was found here as well .",
    "@xcite found a good fit to the _ swift_xrt and bat spectra using a fit similar to our absorbed partial covering thermal model ( `` abs pc th '' ) , with a best - fit temperature similar to ours , although with a somewhat higher partial covering fraction and somewhat lower local absorption .",
    "swift_xrt data they used could only constrain a single iron line at 6.61 kev with width @xmath46kev , which they noted was likely the sign of blended lines .",
    "our deeper observation shows this is in fact the case , as _",
    "suzaku_can easily resolve the three lines .",
    "the three iron emission lines visible in figures  [ fig : spec ] and [ fig : absspec ] are all strong and narrow ; none of our fits require broadening beyond the instrumental resolution .",
    "although the fe xxvand fe xxvilines can be understood in the thermal models as due to the hot plasma , the fe k 6.4 kev line must be generated via fluorescence .",
    "@xcite showed that an 10 kev bremsstrahlung source embedded in an absorber will generate ( due to absorption and fluorescence into the line of sight ) a predicted equivalent width of the fe k line of 0.67 ( n@xmath47kev . using this result with the `` abs pc th '' case ( including both absorption components )",
    ", we find an equivalent width of 0.13 kev .",
    "in addition , there may also be fluorescence due to reflection from the surface of the compact object ( assumed here to be a white dwarf ) . in this case",
    ", @xcite calculated that a 10 - 20 kev bremsstrahlung reflector subtending a @xmath48  solid angle would generate an equivalent width of 0.1 kev , assuming an observed angle to the reflecting surface of @xmath49 .",
    "we thus get a total equivalent width of 0.23 kev , consistent with the actual value of @xmath50kev .",
    "we also note , however , that this calculation assumes that the reflected emission line is not absorbed before escaping , so the calculated result is actually an upper limit .",
    "it seems likely therefore that the continuum around 6.4 kev is at least partially reflected , so our spectral models ( which do not include reflection ) are incomplete .    with the existing data , we can not distinguish ( statistically ) between the power - law and thermal models after including a partial absorber .",
    "figure  [ fig : absspec ] shows that the weak soft x - ray emission is much better fit with the thermal model , although between 3 - 5 kev the power - law model provides a better description .",
    "physically , the thermal model represents an accretion column falling onto the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "this column is likely to have a range of temperatures peaking around our single - temperature value @xcite . including a distribution of lower temperatures which would improve the 3 - 5 kev fit , although more complex models are not justified with the existing data . in similar systems , such as the symbiotic ch cyg , the thermal origin of the plasma",
    "is confirmed by multiple emission lines from ions such as mg , si , and s at lower energies than the iron features .",
    "the strong absorption seen here obscures these lines ; a longer or higher resolution observation is needed to determine if in fact they are present .",
    "the _ lack _  of soft x - ray emission seen in 17 , as compared to ch cyg , is also interesting .",
    "although similar to 17 in hard x - rays , ch cyg is @xmath51  brighter than 17 in the soft ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) x - ray band @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this soft x - ray emission from ch cyg could be explained as scattering in the ionized absorbing material surrounding the hard x - ray source .",
    "their model is similar to that of a seyfert 2 galaxy , with a hard x - ray source surrounded by an edge - on torus of neutral material with an ionized absorber above and below the torus .",
    "this anisotropic absorber removes any direct soft x - rays , but soft x - rays emitted in other directions are still scattered into the line of sight by a nearby absorber photoionized by the hard x - rays emitted by the system .",
    "the most significant difference between their hard x - ray model and ours is that the partial covering fraction was @xmath52% rather than our value of @xmath53% .",
    "possibly in the case of 17 the soft x - rays are simply absorbed by more distant neutral material , or there is no ionized absorbing material above the accretion disk . in the former case",
    ", however , the relatively low galactic absorption of the system suggests this neutral material must still be quite near the compact object .",
    "our initial observation of this source was done in the hope of discovering a new `` highly - absorbed x - ray binary '' of the type described by @xcite , and was driven by its bat detection and location near the galactic plane . unlike the other symbiotic systems that emit hard x - rays , 17 has apparently not shown any signs of nova activity in the optical in the 100 + years since its first description ( although we emphasize that published observations have been rather intermittent ) , and it has always shown weak soft x - ray emission , particularly in our observation .",
    "we can not confirm the nature of the companion , although it seems likely it is a white dwarf based on the relatively low luminosity and iron lines similar to other white dwarf symbiotics .",
    "however , 17 may be the first example of a system with significant fe  k emission lines * without*significant soft x - ray emission or optical outbursts .",
    "this characteristic is potentially important in explaining the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) which includes a hard continuum with broad fluorescent fe k , fe  xxv , and fe  xxvi iron lines in the ratio 1:1.18:0.38 @xcite .",
    "@xcite as well as @xcite have suggested that the continuum emission from the grxe could be due to dwarf novae and coronally - active stars , but did not explain the observed iron lines .",
    "the ratio of the three iron lines strengths in 17 is 1:1:0.63 ( errors of @xmath54% ) .",
    "if a large number of as - yet undiscovered sources like 17 are common in the galactic ridge , they could explain the origin of its line emission as well .",
