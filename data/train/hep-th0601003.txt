    "implementing the idea of split supersymmetry  @xcite in string theory is straightforward  @xcite .",
    "the appropriate framework is type i theory  @xcite compactified in four dimensions in the presence of constant internal magnetic fields  @xcite , or equivalently @xmath1-branes intersecting at angles  @xcite in the @xmath8-dual picture .",
    "however , in simple brane constructions the gauge group sector comes in multiplets of extended supersymmetry , while matter states are in @xmath9 representations . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that these economical string - inspired brane constructions reconcile with unification of gauge couplings at scales safe from proton decay problems , and provide a natural dark matter candidate .    indeed a simple way to break supersymmetry in the above context",
    "is by deforming the intersection angles of the standard model branes from their special values corresponding to a supersymmetric configuration .",
    "a small deformation of these angles by @xmath10 breaks supersymmetry via a @xmath1-term vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , associated to a magnetized abelian gauge group factor in the @xmath8-dual picture , @xmath11 with @xmath3 the string scale  @xcite .",
    "this leads to mass shifts of order @xmath2 for all charged scalar fields localized at the intersections , such as squarks and sleptons , while gauginos ( and higgsinos ) remain massless .",
    "alternatively supersymmetry breaking can be communicated to the scalar observable sector by radiative corrections from a supersymmetric messenger sector , with @xmath1-breaking triggered by a magnetized abelian subgroup , or a non - supersymmetric sector with large extra dimensions . in all cases all previously massless scalars in the observable sector",
    "are expected to acquire large masses by radiative corrections and a fine - tuning is needed in the higgs sector in order to keep the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and @xmath12 , as required in split supersymmetry .    on the other hand fermion ( gaugino and higgsino )",
    "masses are protected by a chiral @xmath13-symmetry and the magnitude of radiative corrections depends on the mechanism of its breaking .",
    "in fact @xmath13-symmetry is in general broken in the gravitational sector by the gravitino mass but its value , as well as the mediation of the breaking to the brane ( standard model ) sector , is model dependent and brings further uncertainties .",
    "here we will restrict ourselves to possible sources of fermion mass generation due to brane effects described by open string propagation within only global supersymmetry , assuming that gravitational ( closed strings ) corrections are negligible .",
    "indeed , @xmath13-symmetry is in general broken by @xmath14-string corrections and gaugino majorana masses can be induced by a dimension - seven effective operator which is the chiral @xmath15-term  @xcite : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the magnetic @xmath19 and non - abelian gauge superfields , respectively .",
    "its moduli dependent coefficient is given by the topological partition function @xmath20 on a world - sheet with no handles and three boundaries   and @xmath18 gauge groups while the third one can be an orientifold . ] . from the effective field theory point of view",
    ", it corresponds to a two - loop correction involving massive open string states . upon a vev @xmath21 ,",
    "the above @xmath15-term generates majorana gaugino masses that are hierarchically smaller than the scalar masses and behave as @xmath22 .    in models where the gauge bosons come in multiplets of extended supersymmetry",
    ", there exists the possibility of generating dirac gaugino masses that do not require the breaking of @xmath13-symmetry .",
    "such a mass can be induced at one - loop via the effective chiral dimension - five operator  @xcite : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the @xmath9 chiral superfield(s ) containing the additional gaugino(s ) . upon the @xmath1-auxiliary vev @xmath25 this term generates dirac gaugino masses that scale as @xmath26 , and are thus much higher than the majorana masses @xmath27 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the renormalization group evolution and showed that this scenario is compatible with one - loop gauge coupling unification at high scale for both cases where the gauge sector is @xmath28 and @xmath7 supersymmetric .",
    "the low energy sector of these models contains , besides the standard model fields , just some fermion doublets ( higgsinos ) and eventually two singlets , the binos , if the corresponding corrections to their dirac mass vanish .",
    "in fact , the higgsinos must acquire a mass , @xmath5 , of order the electroweak scale in order to provide a dark matter candidate .",
    "this can be induced by the following dimension - seven operator , generated at one loop level  @xcite : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the two @xmath9 higgs supermultiplets .",
    "it follows that the induced higgsino mass is of the same order as the gaugino majorana masses , @xmath31 .",
    "the appearance of gauginos in multiplets of extended supersymmetry is common in previous attempts to embed the standard model in intersecting brane constructions  @xcite .",
    "there are several examples in the literature of such models with gauge sectors forming multiplets of either @xmath7  @xcite or @xmath28 extended supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "in this work we describe the general string framework realizing the above scenario of split supersymmetry with extended supersymmetric gauge sector and perform an explicit one - loop computation of the dimension - five and seven effective operators needed to produce dirac gaugino and higgsino masses , respectively .",
    "the relevant world - sheet diagram is the annulus involving two @xmath1-brane stacks on its boundaries ( or three in the case of higgsinos ) .",
    "we find that both dirac gaugino and higgsino masses are in general non - vanishing when the two brane - stacks are parallel in one of the three internal compactification planes .",
    "the leading behavior in the supersymmetric limit , @xmath32 , gives the coefficient of the corresponding effective operator , which thus receives non - trivial contributions only from @xmath28 supersymmetric sectors .",
    "moreover we find that in this limit the result simplifies and becomes topological ; the non - zero mode determinants cancel and the effective couplings depend only on the momentum lattice of the plane where the two brane - stacks are parallel . in the higgsino case",
    "the two fermions should come from an @xmath28 supersymmetry preserving intersection , localized in the remaining two internal planes .    finally , for concreteness , we present an explicit string construction with the standard model gauge group , precisely three generations of quarks and leptons , and sharing the desired features described above .",
    "moreover , it emerges from an @xmath33 grand unified group and thus satisfies gauge coupling unification , realizing a particular @xmath1-brane configuration proposed in ref .",
    "standard model particles live in the intersection of supersymmetric branes while there is a non - supersymmetric brane such that particles living in its intersection with the observable branes are non - chiral and act as messengers of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking . in this case",
    "the hierarchy between the string scale and the masses of supersymmetric partners can be triggered by extra dimensions hierarchically larger than the string length .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section_susy_breaking ] , we describe the general framework of supersymmetry breaking in @xmath1-brane models intersecting at angles . in section  [ section_dirac_mass ] , we perform the one - loop computation of the induced dirac gaugino masses and extract the coefficient of the relevant dimension - five effective operator by evaluating the behavior in the supersymmetric limit . in section  [ section_higgsino ] , we perform a similar computation for the higgsino masses and the corresponding dimension - seven effective operator . in section  [ model ] , we present an explicit construction of the standard model spectrum in this framework with the desired features .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section  [ section_conclusion ] and finally some relevant formulae are presented in appendix a and some technical computational details about the bosonic correlation function of higgsinos in appendix b.",
    "we will consider a set of intersecting stacks of branes that can be divided into two subsets : the first one , denoted as @xmath34 ( for observable ) , gives rise in its light spectrum to the observable sector , i.e. a supersymmetric version of the standard model with the gauge sector in @xmath28 or @xmath7 representations .",
    "the second subset , which we denote as @xmath35 ( for messenger ) , provides the supersymmetry breaking messengers through its intersections with the branes in @xmath34 .    in order to perform explicit computations ,",
    "we consider a compactification on a six torus factorizable as @xmath36 with appropriate projections and orientifold planes to provide the desired supersymmetric framework .",

[ tori ] ) .        in these cases , we can write the angles @xmath56 as @xmath57 where we define @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) for rectangular ( tilted ) tori . from here on and for simplicity we will remove the tilde from @xmath61 . given a generic couple @xmath62 of stacks of branes they intersect with angles @xmath63 in the @xmath64-th torus : @xmath65 of special importance is the number of such intersections as it measures the number of chiral fermions",

    "in the special case where the brane stack @xmath67 is the image of @xmath40 under the orientifold action ( @xmath68 ) , the chiral states given by this formula fall in two categories : they transform either in the antisymmetric ( a ) or in the symmetric ( s ) representation of the gauge group , due to the orientifold projection .",
    "their respective multiplicities are given by : @xmath69 in simple toroidal compactifications , states arising from open strings with both ends on the same stack of branes form representations of @xmath7 supersymmetry . for more complicated compactifications , part of these states can be projected out and one remains with representations of lower supersymmetry . in this work , we will focus on the cases where these states are in @xmath7 or @xmath28 multiplets as already stated .",
    "open strings stretching between two non - parallel stacks of @xmath70 and @xmath71 branes give rise to states in the bifundamental representation @xmath72 of @xmath73 .",
    "the lightest modes contain , in addition to massless fermions , scalars with masses : @xmath74 for parallel branes the first three states become the @xmath7 scalar partners of the gauge vector bosons . on the other hand ,",
    "if some of them are massless there is a boson  fermion degeneracy that indicates that part of the original supersymmetry is preserved . moreover , if any of the @xmath75 angles vanishes , a supersymmetric mass @xmath76 can be generated through separation of the branes by a distance @xmath77 in the corresponding torus . finally , the last mass in ( [ genericmass ] ) contains the contribution of a massive string oscillator that could become the lightest state for some values of the angles .",
    "there are three cases corresponding to three different kinds of intersections that must be discussed :    @xmath78 the case where branes @xmath40 and @xmath67 are in the observable set @xmath79 with intersections giving rise to chiral @xmath9 multiplets .",
    "the lightest states @xmath80 are identified with quarks , leptons and their supersymmetric partners . this can be achieved with the choice @xmath81 which is such that for generic values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 the system only preserves one supersymmetry . for simplicity",
    ", we are using here the notation @xmath84 and choosing @xmath85 . @xmath78 the case where branes @xmath40 and @xmath67 are in the observable set @xmath79 , and states in their intersection give rise to @xmath28 supermultiplets which are identified with supersymmetric pairs of higgs doublets .",
    "this corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ susymass ] ) with @xmath86 ,  i.e. @xmath87 we assume that @xmath88 higgs chiral multiplets remain light while the other @xmath28 multiplets get large ( @xmath89 ) supersymmetric masses . actually , this is not the only way to obtain higgs multiplets .",
    "one of the two doublets may emerge from a chiral intersection together with the leptons , say between a @xmath90 and a @xmath19 brane , while the other one could arise as a chiral  anti - doublet \" from the intersection of @xmath90 with the mirror of @xmath19 brane .",
    "@xmath78 the case where brane @xmath40 is in the observable set @xmath79 and brane @xmath67 in sector @xmath91 .",
    "the states @xmath80 living at such intersections are assumed to be non - chiral and we will call them `` messengers '' for reasons that will be apparent below .",
    "they are non - supersymmetric because of mass splitting between fermionic and bosonic modes . through loop effects",
    ", they will induce supersymmetry breaking to the observable sector .",
    "we will use here the notation @xmath92 and choose again @xmath93 .",
    "two different kinds of models can arise at this level .",
    "they correspond to the following two possibilities :    the first possibility is that the states in the intersection @xmath80 originate as a perturbation around an @xmath28 supersymmetric solution .",
    "in fact , in order to have a scale of supersymmetry breaking hierarchically small compared to the string scale we perform a tiny deformation of the intersection angles ( preserving @xmath28 supersymmetry ) : @xmath94 in one of the tori , chosen to be the first one , the branes should remain parallel and separated  ) and will make the configuration stable . ] by a distance @xmath95 ,  i.e. @xmath96 leading to the localized scalar masses : @xmath97 these states will induce at one - loop dirac masses for gauginos and higgsinos , as we will show in next sections . for instance the dirac gaugino masses turn out to be @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the gauge coupling .",
    "this provides a stringy realization of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking in the absence of @xmath13-symmetry breaking .",
    "scalars localized at supersymmetric intersections , as those discussed in ( [ susymass ] ) , can be given a small supersymmetry breaking through another tiny deformation of the corresponding angles by @xmath10 .",
    "this can be described at the effective field theory level as a fayet - iliopoulos @xmath1-term breaking corresponding to the presence of an anomalous @xmath19 factor @xmath100  @xcite . as a result",
    ", scalar masses in the observable sector can acquire different masses depending on whether matter is charged under this @xmath19 or not .",
    "in particular :    * if the observable sector is charged , bosons of the matter multiplets acquire tree - level masses , @xmath2 . * otherwise the bosons of the observable sector receive masses at the two - loop level  @xcite @xmath101    in both cases the transmission of supersymmetry breaking to the gaugino and higgsino sector is mediated through the `` messengers '' since the quark and lepton sectors are chiral ( and do not contribute at this order ) while the higgs sector ( with masses tuned to remain in the tev range ) will contribute negligibly .",
    "note that the brane @xmath67 does not have to be necessarily in sector @xmath91 .",
    "it could also be part of the  observable \" sector .",
    "consider for instance the example where chiral quark doublets come from the intersection of a @xmath102 and a @xmath90 brane stack .",
    "non chiral antiquark doublets , coming from the intersection of @xmath102 with the orientifold image of @xmath90 can play the role of messengers generating dirac gaugino masses for both @xmath102 and @xmath90 gauge groups .",
    "moreover , the image of @xmath90 may have non trivial intersection with another @xmath19 stack producing leptons , and thus it is part of sector @xmath79 .",
    "the second possibility corresponds to the case where a supersymmetry is preserved by the subset of branes in @xmath79 for some choice of the compactification moduli , but will never be conserved by the whole set of branes @xmath103 .",
    "this is for instance the case for the toroidal compactification discussed in section  5 below .",
    "let us denote by @xmath104 the relevant coefficients that define in ( [ genericmass ] ) the supersymmetry preserved by the observable sector .",
    "the intersection between the @xmath34 and @xmath105 branes leads to states @xmath80 with a supersymmetry breaking mass @xmath106 keeping the branes @xmath62 parallel in one of the tori allows to use again the states @xmath80 at their intersection as messengers to produce gaugino and higgsino dirac masses , as in sections  3 and  4 .",
    "however now the desired suppression of @xmath10 will be generated by the presence of a large hierarchy between the size of the compact dimensions .",
    "more precisely for @xmath107 one can obtain an @xmath10 parameter hierarchically smaller than one @xmath108 where the sum obviously goes over the tori where branes intersect . in the absence of tree level supersymmetry",
    "breaking , superpartners in the observable sector will acquire two - loop mass splitting given by ( [ masaescalar ] ) . a toy model based on these ideas",
    "will be presented in section  [ model ] .",
    "as the gauginos lie in representations of extended supersymmetry ( @xmath109 ) , they come in copies that can pair up to receive a dirac mass at one - loop order in the string genus expansion .",
    "the corresponding world - sheet has the topology of a cylinder stretching between two stacks of @xmath70 and @xmath71 branes , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "the vertex operators @xmath110 and @xmath111 associated with the gauginos are inserted on one boundary , for example that corresponding to the @xmath70 branes .",
    "the mass is given by the integrated two - point correlation function of the relevant vertex operators : @xmath112 where the integrals are along the boundary of the annulus .",
    "= 5.5 in     the @xmath28 supersymmetry which relates the gauge vector and gauginos is chosen to be associated with the supercharges that preserve the ( undeformed ) @xmath28 preserving brane intersection ( see eq .",
    "( [ nonsusymass ] ) with @xmath113 ) .",
    "these supercharges are given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes helicities in the internal directions and @xmath116 are weyl spinor indices in four dimensions .",
    "the supercharges have been grouped into majorana spinors in four dimensions .",
    "as the gauginos of @xmath28 supersymmetry have the same internal helicities as the supercharges  ( [ conserved_charges ] ) , the vertex operators in the @xmath117-ghost picture are given by : @xmath118 together with their cpt conjugates which are obtained by simply reversing helicities in the internal directions and flipping the space - time chirality . here @xmath119 is the bosonized two - dimensional reparametrization ghost field , @xmath120 are the target space coordinates , @xmath121 are the space - time momenta , @xmath122 arise from bosonization of the spin fields and @xmath123 is the helicity vector in four dimensions which is constrained by the gso projection to be either @xmath124 also @xmath125 is some normalization constant and @xmath126 are chan - paton factors of the associated gauge group factor .    on the cylinder ,",
    "the total @xmath119-charge must vanish .",
    "therefore , we must use picture - changing to transform one of the vertex operators to the @xmath127 picture .",
    "this is done by operating with the brst charge : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the world - sheet supercurrent : @xmath130 the fields @xmath131 are real world - sheet fermions while in the second and third terms of  ( [ supercurrent ] ) we have used complex coordinates for the internal directions : @xmath132 and analogously for @xmath133 and @xmath134 . note that @xmath135 .",

    "<S> the latter is illustrated , for the case where the gauge bosons appear in @xmath7 representations , by an explicit string model with standard model gauge group , three generations of quarks and leptons and gauge coupling unification . </S>"
