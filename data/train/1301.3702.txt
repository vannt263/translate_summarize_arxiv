    "physical systems in nature are either in or out of equilibrium .",
    "one - dimensional out of equilibrium systems usually exhibit unique critical behaviors such as phase transitions and shock formation@xcite .",
    "these properties make them very interesting to study from both mathematical and physical point of views . needless to say that many of these properties have not been fully understood yet . + an out of equilibrium system is usually exposed to a flux of matter or energy .",
    "this results in a non - zero probability current between different microstates of the system and also entropy production .",
    "it is known that for a system in equilibrium , where detailed balance is hold , the entropy production is deterministically zero .",
    "this is the reason why the entropy production can be an indicator for being out of equilibrium .",
    "+ in recent years much attention has been paid to the study of fluctuation theorems in out of equilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for most of driven markov processes the fluctuation theorem holds .",
    "symmetry properties of the large deviation functions of generalized current fluctuations have also been studied .",
    "these large deviation functions are also shown to obey a gallavotti - cohen ( gc ) type symmetry in systems with a finite state space .",
    "in contrast , for those systems with unbounded state space , such as the one - dimensional partially asymmetric zero - range process with open boundaries , the distribution of large current fluctuations does not satisfy the gc symmetry  @xcite .",
    "other gc type symmetries have been found in a restricted class of markov jump processes where the microscopic transitions have a particular structure and satisfy certain constraints  @xcite .",
    "+ in  @xcite a large deviation analysis for fluctuations of partial and total particle currents in a zero - range process on a simple diamond lattice with open boundary conditions has been done .",
    "the validity of the gc fluctuation relation for these particle currents is investigated and it has been found that the fluctuation relation is not satisfied for partial particle currents between sites even if it is satisfied for the total particle current flowing between the boundaries . + so far , most of studies on the validity or breakdown of the gc symmetry and the fluctuation theorem have been mostly concentrated on boundary - driven systems . in this paper",
    "we consider an exactly solvable one - dimensional coagulation - decoagulation system .",
    "it is known that the system undergoes a phase transition in the steady state from a high - density to a low - density phase .",
    "we aim to study the large deviation functions for the fluctuations of entropy production rate and particle current and investigate their symmetries in long - time limit .",
    "+ it turns out that the average entropy production rate of this system can be calculated exactly using a matrix product method .",
    "the average entropy production rate near the transition point changes abruptly , hence it can be used as a signal for the presence of a phase transition in the system . studying the large deviation function for the entropy production rate reveals that the widely observed kink in the large deviation function disappears in the limit of large driving fields .",
    "the kink is also negligible as the driving field vanishes .",
    "however in the intermediate driving field regime the kink is prominent .",
    "this indicates that the characteristics of the kink in the large deviation function for the entropy production rate can be used to investigate the phase transition in the system .",
    "+ our investigations also show that the large deviation functions for the local particle currents , defined as the net particle current through two consecutive lattice sites , do not satisfy the gc fluctuation relation .",
    "in contrast , the large deviation function for what we call the global particle current , defined as the sum of the local particle currents , satisfies the gc fluctuation relation .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in the second section we will define the process and summarize the known results about its steady state .",
    "the second section is dedicated to the mathematical basis of the fluctuation theorem .",
    "exact expression for average entropy production rate and its asymptotic behavior in the thermodynamic limit will be given in the fourth section .",
    "we will also perform a large deviation analysis for fluctuations of the entropy production in the fifth section . in the sixth section",
    "we will define the particle currents and check the validity of the gc fluctuation relation for these quantities .",
    "we will finally summarize the results .",
    "let us consider a system of interacting particles on a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath0 with reflecting boundaries .",
    "the bulk of the system is assumed to evolve in time according to the following rules @xmath1 in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for the presence of a particle and a hole in each lattice site respectively .",
    "note that there is no injection or extraction at the boundaries .",
    "this particle - nonconserving stochastic process has already been studied extensively in related literature  @xcite .",
    "the system has two different steady states :",
    "an empty lattice is a trivial steady state .     simple sketch of a shock with two shock fronts on a lattice with @xmath0 lattice sites .",
    "the density of particles in each region is denoted by @xmath4.,width=302 ]    it has been shown that the nontrivial steady state of this coagulation - decoagulation system is a matrix - product state ( for a review of the matrix product approach see  @xcite ) provided that some constraints are fulfilled .",
    "more detailed investigations have shown that the steady state of the system can also be written in terms of a linear superposition of shock structures with two shock fronts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the shock fronts have simple random walk dynamics provided that some constraints on the microscopic reaction rates in  ( [ rules ] ) are met .",
    "these results confirm that the system has two different phases in the nontrivial steady state : a high - density ( hd ) phase and a low - density ( ld ) phase . in the hd phase",
    "the left ( right ) shock front moves preferentially to the left ( right ) while in the ld phase both shock fronts move preferentially to the left .",
    "+ for the sake of simplicity we adopt the following choices for the microscopic reaction rates in  ( [ rules ] )  @xcite @xmath5 in terms of these newly defined microscopic reaction rates the system is in the hd phase for @xmath6 while it is in the ld phase for @xmath7 . in the hd phase",
    "the bulk density of particles is equal to @xmath8 while it is equal to zero in the ld phase . on the coexistence line",
    "where @xmath9 the bulk density of particles on the lattice changes linearly .",
    "+ in the following section we will briefly review the mathematical basis of fluctuation theorem .",
    "let us consider a continuous - time markov process with a configuration space which is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that a spontaneous transition from configuration @xmath11 to configuration @xmath12 takes place with a rate @xmath13 where both @xmath11 and @xmath12 belong to @xmath10 .",
    "the time evolution of the probability distribution @xmath14 , for the system being in @xmath11 at time @xmath15 , is given by a master equation which can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the markov generator with elements @xmath18 using quantum hamiltonian formalism  @xcite the master equation  ( [ me ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath19 which is similar to the schrdinger equation in imaginary time . + the generating function for any current @xmath20 , which is a functional of the stochastic trajectory in configuration space @xmath10 , can be written as @xmath21",
    "in which @xmath22 is a row vector with components @xmath23 and that @xmath24 is the probability distribution vector at @xmath25 .",
    "if the current @xmath20 changes its value by @xmath26 whenever a jump from @xmath27 occurs , then the matrix elements of the modified generator @xmath28 in  ( [ gf ] ) can be written as  @xcite @xmath29 in long - time limit the generating function  ( [ gf ] ) can be written as @xmath30 in which @xmath31 is given by the lowest eigenvalue of the modified generator  ( [ modgen ] ) .",
    "finally the legendre transformation of @xmath31 , according to the grtner - ellis theorem , gives the large deviation function  @xcite @xmath32 according to the large deviation principle the probability distribution function , defined as the probability to observe a time - averaged value @xmath33 of the current @xmath20 over time interval @xmath34 $ ] , can now be written as @xmath35 in limit of large time the probability distribution function @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a field conjugated to the flux @xmath39 .",
    "the relation  ( [ ft ] ) can also be written as @xmath40 which is also known as the cg fluctuation relation .",
    "depending on the definition of the time - integrated current @xmath20 , the parameter @xmath41 can be regarded as entropy production rate or particle current .",
    "+ whenever the system jumps from @xmath11 to @xmath12 the entropy in the environment changes by @xmath42  @xcite . in order to calculate the total entropy changes in a trajectory one takes @xmath43 in  ( [ modgen ] ) .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue of the modified generator  ( [ modgen ] ) satisfies what we know as the gc symmetry @xmath44 the large deviation function also satisfies the gc fluctuation relation @xmath45 in which we have defined @xmath46 .",
    "the average entropy production rate in the environment can be calculated using @xmath47 in order to analyze fluctuations of particle current @xmath48 in the steady state we need to count the net particle jumps during the time interval @xmath15 .",
    "whenever the system changes its configuration from @xmath11 to @xmath12 a particle might contribute to particle current . to count total particle jumps in a trajectory",
    "one can take @xmath49 in  ( [ modgen ] ) for those configuration changes which contribute to particle current on the lattice in two different directions  @xcite . in this case",
    "the lowest eigenvalue of the modified generator  ( [ modgen ] ) satisfies the gc symmetry @xmath50 where @xmath38 is the conjugate field . on the other hand",
    ", the large deviation function @xmath51 satisfies the gc fluctuation relation @xmath52",
    "if @xmath53 is the probability of being in configuration @xmath11 in the steady state , then besides the formula  ( [ averageentropyproductiond ] ) the average entropy production in the environment is given by  @xcite @xmath54 provided that all transitions are reversible .",
    "recent investigations show that the behavior of the average entropy production in systems with out of equilibrium phase transitions changes at the critical point  @xcite ; therefore , it plays an important role in classifying different nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "+ in what follows we first show that  ( [ averageentropyproduction ] ) can be calculated exactly for the system defined by  ( [ rules ] ) and  ( [ newrules ] ) . in order to calculate the steady state probability distribution @xmath53 , one can use a matrix product approach . according to this approach @xmath53",
    "is written as a product of noncommuting operators which satisfy an algebra  @xcite .",
    "for the system defined by  ( [ rules ] ) and  ( [ newrules ] ) it has been shown that there exists a four - dimensional matrix representation for the quadratic algebra of the system  @xcite .        using the four - dimensional matrix representation and the results obtained in  @xcite we find that in large-@xmath0 limit the average entropy production rate in the environment is given by @xmath55   \\frac{2(\\gamma^2 - 1)(q^2\\gamma^2 - 1)(q^2 + 2\\gamma^2(\\gamma^2 - 1))\\ln q}{(1+q^2)(q^2-\\gamma^2)q\\gamma^4 } & \\mbox{for } \\ ; q>\\gamma . \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] as can be seen @xmath56 changes discontinuously at the transition point .",
    "in other words , the average entropy production rate per lattice site in the steady state @xmath57 is a constant in the hd phase while it is zero in the ld phase .",
    "this can be easily explained as follows : in the hd phase the lattice is nearly full of particles .",
    "this can be realized by the fact that in this phase the steady state is a linear superposition of product shock measures with two shock fronts in which left shock front moves preferentially to the left while the right shock front moves preferentially to the right ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the more particles contribute into the reactions , the more entropy is produced in the environment . since nearly all lattice sites contribute in entropy production , the average entropy production  ( [ averageentropyproduction ] ) in the hd phase is proportional to the system size . in contrast , in the ld phase both shock fronts move preferentially to the left ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) ; therefore , the lattice is almost empty . in this phase",
    "much less particles contribute in entropy production .",
    "that is why the average entropy production per lattice site is zero in large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we should also note that the average entropy production in the steady state  ( [ averageentropyproduction ] ) is equal to zero for @xmath58 .",
    "this is the value of @xmath59 for which the system is in equilibrium .",
