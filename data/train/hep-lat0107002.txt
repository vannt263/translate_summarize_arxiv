    "it is well known that studying finite density qcd through lattice simulations is a very hard problem .",
    "the fermionic determinant at finite chemical potential is complex , and gives an oscillating behavior in quantum averages which makes simulations very inefficient .",
    "since the naive quenched approximation at finite chemical potential leads to an essentially different world @xcite , the use of dynamical fermions would be essential to extract the relevant physics . in spite of these difficulties ,",
    "the study of hadrons in a finite baryonic environment is quite important @xcite , in view of recent experimental developments and of the theoretical interest in the phase structure of qcd .",
    "search for the quark gluon plasma phase in high energy heavy ion collision experiments requires theoretical understanding of hadronic properties at finite temperature and density @xcite .",
    "moreover , some experimental results can be interpreted by assuming a shift in the mass and the width of the @xmath2 meson , induced by the dense nuclear medium even below the deconfinement transition @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new technique to investigate non - zero chemical potential using lattice qcd simulations .",
    "there are several approaches to circumvent the difficulty of studying a finite chemical potential system , and they seem successful to a limited extent @xcite . in particular , the study of baryon number susceptibility at zero baryon density has reported an abrupt jump at the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "there is in fact much interesting physical information which can be extracted from the behavior of a system at small chemical potential .",
    "our strategy is to expand the hadronic quantities , such as masses , in the vicinity of zero chemical potential at finite temperature , and explore their changes through the response to the chemical potential at @xmath3 .",
    "this allows to perform the numerical simulations with standard methods .",
    "the taylor expansion in @xmath4 has also been used , and its properties discussed , in @xcite . there , the behavior of observables , measured by standard methods as a function of an imaginary chemical potential @xmath4 , is fitted by a taylor series amenable to analytic continuation to real @xmath4 ( assuming a large enough analyticity domain ) . here we measure the taylor coefficients directly , in a single simulation , at @xmath3 , by calculating the derivatives of the relevant observables .",
    "although the taylor expansion can not reproduce the non - analyticity inherent to a phase transition , it may suffice for observing the rounded , analytic behavior indicative of a phase transition in a finite volume , and for applying finite size scaling to probe the transition in the infinite volume limit .",
    "our preliminary results have been reported in @xcite .",
