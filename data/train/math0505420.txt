    "in this paper we address the problem of computing the fundamental group of a symplectic @xmath0-manifold . for a compact manifold equipped with a hamiltonian circle action , a result in @xcite states that this group is equal to the fundamental group of any of its reduced spaces ( as topological spaces ) and to the fundamental group of its minimum and maximum level sets .",
    "we will consider here non - hamiltonian actions on compact manifolds ( theorem  [ thm:1 ] ) and hamiltonian actions on non - compact manifolds with a proper moment map ( theorem  [ thm:2 ] ) .",
    "when the action is * non - hamiltonian * , one can consider a _ _ generalized moment map _ _ introduced by mcduff in @xcite as follows : first , the symplectic form is deformed to a rational invariant symplectic form making the non - zero class @xmath1 $ ] rational , where @xmath2 denotes the vector field generating the action ; then , for a multiple of this symplectic form , there is a map @xmath3 such that @xmath4 , called _ generalized moment map _ ( or _ circle valued moment map _ ) .",
    "this map has many of the properties of an ordinary moment map and can even be used to reduce @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , choosing an invariant pair of a riemannian metric @xmath6 and a compatible almost complex structure @xmath7 on @xmath5 and identifying @xmath0 with @xmath8 in the usual way , we may define the gradient of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath6 and see that it is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "its flow has all the nice properties of the gradient flow of an ordinary moment map .",
    "in particular , its critical set is a disjoint union of symplectic submanifolds of @xmath5 ( each of codimension at least @xmath11 since @xmath9 has no local maxima or minima ) .    using the gradient flow of @xmath9",
    "we prove ( theorem  [ thm:1 ] ) that , if @xmath5 is a connected compact symplectic manifold equipped with a non - hamiltonian circle action and @xmath12 is a connected component of an arbitrary level set of the generalized moment map @xmath9 then , as fundamental groups of topological spaces , @xmath13 is a semidirect product @xmath14 when the action has no critical points , or @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a connected component of the symplectic quotient @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "note that the proof for the hamiltonian case presented in @xcite relies heavily , at each step , on the existence of a minimum and so it can not be adapted to the non - hamiltonian case . nevertheless , since we have a generalized moment map , we can still use ( circle - valued ) morse theory to prove the above result .",
    "when the action is hamiltonian but @xmath5 is * not compact * one can again use morse theory , provided that the moment map is proper ( i.e. the inverse image of a compact set is compact ) . in this case",
    "we obtain that , if @xmath19 is a connected symplectic manifold ( not necessarily compact ) with proper moment map @xmath20 and @xmath12 is an arbitrary ( compact ) level set of @xmath9 then , as fundamental groups of topological spaces , @xmath13 is either , @xmath21 when the action has no critical points , or @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the symplectic quotient at any value of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath9 has a local minimum ( or a maximum ) , we recover the referred result for the compact case in @xcite : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the sets of minimal and maximal points respectively .",
    "although properness of the moment map is a strong condition which is not verified in many problems in classical mechanics with a global @xmath0-action , our results may still be relevant when , for instance , we can perform a preliminary reduction or symplectic cutting ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) making the induced @xmath0-moment map proper . let us remark , however , that the requirement of a proper moment map is essential to our results as can be seen in examples  [ ex:6 ] and [ ex:7 ] . indeed , even the statement in proposition  [ prop:3 ] that all reduced spaces have the same fundamental group may fail to hold when the moment map is not proper .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:5 ] , we present several other examples illustrating our results .",
    "in this section we prove our result for non - hamiltonian actions on compact manifolds :    [ thm:1 ] let @xmath5 be a connected , compact symplectic manifold equipped with a non - hamiltonian circle action and @xmath3 the corresponding generalized moment map .",
    "let @xmath12 be a connected component of an arbitrary level set of @xmath9 . then , as fundamental groups of topological spaces , @xmath13 is a semidirect product @xmath27 when the action has no critical points , or @xmath28 where @xmath16 is a connected component of the ( arbitrary ) symplectic quotient @xmath17 , for @xmath18 .    throughout",
    ", we shall choose an @xmath0-invariant compatible pair , @xmath29 , of an almost complex structure and a riemannian metric and we identify @xmath0 with @xmath8 in the usual way to define the gradient of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "this gradient is equal to @xmath10 , where @xmath2 is the vector field generating the action .    in order to prove theorem  [ thm:1 ]",
    "we will need a series of preliminary results .",
    "the first one is proved in @xcite but we include a sketch of its proof for the sake of completion .",
    "@xcite [ le:1 ] let @xmath5 be a symplectic compact connected manifold equipped with a non - hamiltonian circle action and @xmath30 the corresponding generalized moment map .",
    "then , given any point @xmath31 , there exists a homologically non - trivial loop @xmath32 passing through @xmath33 .",
    "since the generalized moment map is locally a function , we can define its hessian at critical points , their indices and the gradient flow of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , since the action is non - hamiltonian , the critical points can not have index @xmath34 nor @xmath35 , where @xmath35 is the dimension of @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider the quotient space @xmath36 , where @xmath37 iff @xmath38 and @xmath39 are in the same connected component of a level set of @xmath9 .",
    "as the indices of the critical points of @xmath9 are even , @xmath40 has no branch point .",
    "moreover , @xmath40 has no boundary and is homeomorphic to a circle ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",

    "this implies that @xmath128 has the same homotopy type as @xmath129 , and so @xmath130 is the free product with amalgamation @xmath131 however , the local normal form for @xmath9 ( and consequently for @xmath112 ) on a neighborhood of @xmath57 is the same as the local normal form of a neighborhood of a critical set of an ordinary moment map , implying that @xmath132 is a weighted projectivized bundle over @xmath57 and so , since we also have that @xmath60 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath57 , we conclude that @xmath133 and so @xmath134 . using @xmath89 instead of @xmath9 ( corresponding to reversing the direction of the circle action ) we obtain that @xmath135 for @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a critical value of @xmath112 ( if it exists ) and the interval @xmath138 contains only regular values . repeating this for every critical value of @xmath112 we conclude that all connected components of all reduced spaces ( even critical ones ) have the same fundamental group .",
    "note that an alternative proof of this proposition could follow from the fact that , for circle actions , when passing a critical value of the moment map the reduced spaces change by a weighted blow - down followed by a weighted blow - up ( cf .",
