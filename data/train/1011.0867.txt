    "meson - nucleus bound systems are considered to be very interesting objects in the contemporary hadron - nuclear physics . especially , we can make use of them as @xmath2 for the studies of hadron properties at finite density which are closely related to the symmetry breaking and restoration patters of the strong interaction @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting results was obtained by observation of deeply bound pionic atoms @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath3-wave strength of the pion - nucleus optical potential is considered to provide the information on the pion decay constant @xmath4 in nucleus , it is extremely interesting to study the @xmath3-wave part of the potential . for the purpose",
    ", it is highly required to observe the pionic @xmath3-states precisely because the @xmath3-states properties strongly depend on the @xmath3-wave potential @xcite and , thus , the @xmath5 states in heavy nuclei ( @xmath6 ) provide key information on the isovector part of the @xmath3-wave potential , which is related to @xmath4 through the tomozawa - weinberg theorem @xcite . according to this line , suzuki @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite performed an experiment based on the theoretical predictions @xcite , and obtained excellent new data of the deeply bound pionic @xmath5 states in sn isotopes , which helped much to deduce the new experimental information on the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nucleus @xcite .",
    "thus , it is extremely interesting to extend this research field of meson bound systems to include other mesic systems .    in this paper , we report the recent research activities on the @xmath0 mesic nuclei .",
    "we also mention shortly the recent research activities on @xmath9 mesic nucleus .",
    "we discuss the @xmath0-nucleus systems in this report .",
    "we are interested in the @xmath10mesic nuclei because they can be considered as a doorway to the study of the @xmath11 resonance @xmath12 in nucleus due to the strong coupling of @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the nature of the @xmath14 is still controversial and there exist two different pictures of @xmath14 , which provide significantly different @xmath10nucleus potentials as shown below .    around",
    "twenty years ago , the @xmath0-mesic nuclei were studied by haider and liu  @xcite and by chiang , oset and liu  @xcite . as for the formation reaction , the attempt to find the bound states by the ( @xmath15,p ) reaction led to a negative result  @xcite .",
    "recently , some experiments in photoproduction processes indicated observations of such bound states in @xmath16c target  @xcite and @xmath17he target  @xcite . a result of the proton induced reaction",
    "was reported in ref .",
    "new experiments are also planed to investigate further the @xmath0-nucleus interaction and possible bound states  @xcite .      here",
    ", we briefly explain how the @xmath19 nature affects the @xmath18nucleus optical potential  @xcite using two theoretical models . in the @xmath0-nucleon system ,",
    "the @xmath14 resonance plays an important role due to the dominant @xmath20 coupling .",
    "here we evaluate the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential @xmath21 in the two different models which are based on distinct physical pictures of @xmath14 .",
    "one is the chiral doublet model .",
    "this is an extension of the linear sigma model for the nucleon and its chiral partner  @xcite .",
    "we adopted a mirror assignment of the chiral doublet model in this paper .",
    "the other is the chiral unitary model , in which @xmath14 is dynamically generated in the coupled channel meson - baryon scattering  @xcite .",
    "we will compare the phenomenological consequences of these models based on the common assumption , the @xmath14 dominance of the @xmath0-nucleon system .    in the first approach , the @xmath14",
    "is introduced as a particle with a large width and appears in an effective lagrangian together with the nucleon field .",
    "assuming @xmath14-hole excitation induced by the @xmath0 meson in nucleus , we obtain the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential at finite nuclear density as , @xmath22 in the local density approximation and the heavy baryon limit@xcite . here",
    "@xmath23 is the @xmath0-nucleus reduced mass and @xmath24 is the density distribution of the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath20 coupling is assumed to be @xmath25-wave : @xmath26 and the coupling constant @xmath27 is determined to be @xmath28 in order to reproduce the partial width @xmath29mev at tree level . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the effective masses of @xmath32 and @xmath19 in the nuclear medium , respectively . considering that the @xmath14 mass in free space lies only 50 mev above the threshold and that the mass difference of @xmath32 and @xmath14 might change in the medium , the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential",
    "is expected to be extremely sensitive to the in - medium properties of @xmath32 and @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , if the mass difference reduces in the nuclear medium as @xmath33 , then the optical potential turns to be repulsive @xcite .    in the chiral doublet model together with the expected partial restoration of chiral symmetry , a reduction of the mass difference of @xmath32 and @xmath14 in the medium is found to be in the mean field approximation as @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the @xmath32 and @xmath14 masses in free space , respectively , and @xmath37 here we take the linear density approximation of the in - medium modification of the chiral condensate , and the parameter @xmath38 represents the strength of the chiral restoration at the nuclear saturation density @xmath39 .",
    "the empirical value of @xmath38 lies from 0.1 to 0.3  @xcite . here",
    "we perform our calculations with @xmath40 and @xmath41 in order to clarify the effects of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vopt ] , we show the @xmath0-nucleus optical potentials obtained by the chiral doublet model with @xmath40 and @xmath42 in the case of the @xmath0-@xmath43b system @xcite .",
    "as shown in the figure , the @xmath0-nucleus optical potential has a curious shape of a repulsive core inside nucleus and an attractive pocket in nuclear surface .",
    "the qualitative feature of the optical potential discussed here , such as the appearance of the repulsive core in the case of @xmath42 , is independent of type of nuclei .",
    "thus , it is extremely interesting to confirm the existence ( or non - existence ) of this curious shaped potential experimentally .",
    "let us move on the second approach of the chiral unitary model  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the @xmath14 resonance is expressed as a dynamically generated object in the meson baryon scattering , and one solves a coupled channel bethe - salpeter equation to obtain the @xmath0-nucleon scattering amplitude .",
    "the optical potential in medium is obtained by closing the nucleon external lines in the @xmath13 scattering amplitude and considering the in - medium effect on the scattering amplitude , such as pauli blocking . since the @xmath14 in the chiral unitary approach is found to have a large component of @xmath44 and the @xmath45 hyperon is free from the pauli blocking in nuclear medium , very little mass shift of @xmath14 is expected in the medium @xcite , while the chiral doublet model predicts the significant mass reduction with the partial restoration of chiral symmetry as discussed above . the optical potential obtained by the chiral unitary approach in ref .",
    "@xcite is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vopt ] , and the potential resembles that of the chiral doublet model with @xmath40 due to the small medium effect .",
    "the calculated binding energies and widths for both potentials are reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . as we can expect from the potential shapes , they show the significant differences , which are expected to be observed in the spectra of the formation reactions of @xmath18nucleus systems .",
    "we use the green s function method  @xcite to calculate the formation spectra of the meson@xmath46nucleus systems  @xcite .",
    "we briefly explain the formalism for the ( @xmath47 ) reaction case as an example .",
    "the expected spectra of the ( @xmath47 ) reactions @xmath48 are evaluated from the nuclear response function @xmath49 and the elementary cross section @xmath50 in the impulse approximation as , @xmath51 the calculation of the nuclear response function with a meson - nucleus complex optical potential @xmath52 is formulated by morimatsu and yazaki  @xcite as , @xmath53 where the summation is taken over all possible final states .",
    "@xmath54 is the green s function of the produced meson interacting in the nucleus and defined as , @xmath55 where @xmath56 indicates the proton hole state and @xmath57 indicates the hamiltonian of the meson - nucleus system , which includes the optical potential @xmath52 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath58 denotes the transition of the incident particle ( @xmath59 ) to the nucleon - hole and the outgoing nucleon ( @xmath32 ) , involving the nucleon - hole wavefunction @xmath60 and the distorted waves @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the projectile and ejectile . by taking the appropriate spin sum ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath58 can be written as , @xmath63_{jm}\\chi_i({\\vec r})~,~\\ ] ] with the meson angular wavefunction @xmath64 and the spin wavefunction @xmath65 of the ejectile .",
    "the semi - exclusive spectra can be calculated by decomposing the response function  ( [ s(e ) ] ) into the escape and conversion parts : @xmath66 .",
    "the conversion part and the escape part are known to express the contributions to the ( @xmath47 ) spectra of the meson absorption in nucleus and the quasi - elastic meson production processes , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:820 ] the calculated @xmath16c(@xmath67)@xmath43c@xmath68 cross sections for the formation of the @xmath0-@xmath43c system with the chiral doublet model potential for @xmath42 ( left panel ) and that of the chiral unitary model ( right panel ) @xcite .",
    "the incident pion kinetic energy @xmath69 is @xmath70 mev corresponding to the recoilless condition at the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the horizontal axis indicates the excitation energy @xmath71 defined as , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath0 binding energy and @xmath74 the neutron separation energy from the neutron single - particle level @xmath75 . @xmath76",
    "indicates the separation energy from the neutron level corresponding to the ground state of the daughter nucleus and @xmath77 .",
    "hence @xmath78 corresponds to the @xmath0 production threshold with the ground state daughter nucleus . in the figure",
    ", we show the total spectra by the solid line and the contributions from dominant subcomponents by the dashed lines , separately .",
    "we take into account the difference of the separation energy @xmath79 mev for a subcomponent accompanied by a @xmath80 hole - state . in such a case",
    ", the @xmath0 meson production threshold appears at @xmath81  mev as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:820 ] by the vertical dotted line .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig:820 ] shows that the spectra are dominated by two contributions , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , since the final states with the total spin @xmath84 are largely enhanced under the recoil - free kinematics .",
    "let us see the spectra around the threshold ; @xmath85 mev @xmath86 mev .",
    "the spectra in this energy region were already shown in the case of the ( d,@xmath17he ) and ( @xmath87 ) reactions in refs .",
    "the present work confirms that the spectral shape is very similar with the previous calculations showing that the structure of the formation spectra is not sensitive to the reaction mechanism .",
    "as already discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , the spectra with the ( @xmath67 ) reaction around the @xmath0 production threshold show that the repulsive nature of the optical potential in the chiral doublet model shifts the spectra into the higher energy region , whereas the spectra obtained in the chiral unitary model is shifted into the lower energy region as a result of its attractive potential .",
    "we conclude that the difference between the expected spectra with two chiral models seems to be visible in the ( @xmath67 ) reaction as well as the ( @xmath87 ) reaction in spite of the distortion effect for the injected particle @xmath59 .",
    "the systematic results and the detail discussions are found in ref .",
    "the @xmath18nucleus optical potential has large imaginary part in general , which makes the decay widths of the possible bound states large and makes the observation of distinct peak structures in the spectrum difficult .",
    "thus , it is interesting to consider the systems of @xmath0 in light nuclei because we can expect to avoid the additional difficulties due to overlaps of many subcomponents to deduce the physical information from the observed spectrum .    in this subsection",
    ", we consider the formation reaction of the @xmath89 system proposed in ref .",
    "we have evaluated the formation rate of the @xmath89 system using the green s function method .",
    "we have paid the special attention to calculate both cross sections of the @xmath0 production @xmath90 reaction and the bound state formation @xmath91 using the same model simultaneously .",
    "this is important to reduce the uncertainties of the theoretical calculation due to the nuclear transition form factor in the very high momentum transfer reaction @xmath92 by using the @xmath90 data near threshold @xcite .",
    "we have developed a simple theoretical model for the reaction , where we include one parameter to control the nuclear transition form factor @xmath93 with @xmath0 production in addition to the @xmath18nucleus optical potential strength .",
    "the details of the theoretical model will be described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we show the preliminary results in fig .",
    "[ total_fig_50_40 ] where we have assumed the depth of the @xmath18nucleus optical potential as @xmath94 @xmath95 at nuclear center , which are similar with those of chiral unitary model .",
    "the absolute value of the cross section is scaled to fit the data @xcite .",
    "we found that the shape of the @xmath90 data were reproduced reasonably well by the escape part of the spectrum .",
    "the conversion part corresponding to the contribution of the @xmath0 absorption process by nucleus is found to have peak structure at the threshold on the large structureless background .",
    "the results of this model will provide useful estimates for the planned experiment @xcite where the particle pair emissions from @xmath0 absorption will be measured .",
    "the calculated spectrum shape is found to be sensitive to the optical potential strengths and to the ( non-)existence of the bound states .",
    "thus , we think the experimental data will provide new information on the @xmath18nucleus interaction .",
    "the systematic numerical results will be reported in ref @xcite .      as for the formation of other meson@xmath46nucleus systems , we mention here another research activity .",
    "the @xmath9 - nucleus systems are very interesting because the origin of its large mass is believed to be the consequences of the @xmath97 anomaly effects .",
    "structure and formation reaction of the @xmath9 - nucleus systems were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first time , and the formation of this system by ( @xmath98 reactions are also reported in ref @xcite , recently .",
    "we can expect to have important information on the anomaly effects at finite density , which has not been known at all so far , by studying the @xmath9 - nucleus systems .",
    "the mesic atoms and mesic nuclei are very interesting and fruitful objects to study the aspects of the strong interaction symmetries at finite density .",
    "we briefly explain the recent research activities on @xmath0 mesic nuclei .",
    "we think that the theoretical results reported here will help to consider future experiments and to obtain new information on meson and/or baryon resonance such as @xmath19 properties in nucleus from data .",
