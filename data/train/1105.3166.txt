    "@xcite .",
    "we consider a test for a parameter @xmath4 , which here represents the signal strength ( or any parameter proportional to the rate ) of a certain signal process .",
    "a test of a given @xmath4 is carried out by specifying a region of data outcomes called the _ critical region _ , which are disfavoured , in a sense discussed below , under assumption of @xmath4 .",
    "the data outcome could be , for example , the number of events observed in a given region of phase space , or it could represent a larger set of numerical values . here we will use @xmath5 to represent the data , and @xmath6 to denote the critical region .    the critical region is chosen to such that the probability to observe the data in it , under assumption of the hypothesized @xmath4 , is not greater than a given constant @xmath7 , called the _ size _ or _ significance level _ of the test , i.e. ,    @xmath8    often by convention @xmath9 is used .",
    "if the data are observed in the critical region , the hypothesis @xmath4 is rejected .",
    "it is necessary in general to specify eq .",
    "( [ eq : sizeoftest ] ) as an inequality because the data may be discrete ( e.g. , an integer number of events ) , and so there may not exist a subset of the possible data values for which the summed probability is exactly equal to @xmath7 .    it is convenient to construct from the data a test statistic @xmath10 , such that greater @xmath10 reflects an increasing level of incompatibility between the data and the hypothesized parameter value @xmath4 . in this way the boundary of the critical region in data space is given by a surface of constant @xmath10 , with the critical region containing the data that give the greatest values of @xmath10",
    "once such a function has been defined , one can for any observed value @xmath11 compute a @xmath12-value , i.e. , the probability under assumption of @xmath4 to find data with equal or greater incompatibility with @xmath4 ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 represents the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath10 assuming a data distribution with strength parameter @xmath4 . thus the test can be equivalently formulated by rejecting @xmath4 if its @xmath12-value is found less than @xmath7 .",
    "a test of size @xmath7 can be carried out for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "the set of values not rejected constitutes a _ confidence interval _ for @xmath4 with confidence level @xmath15 .",
    "this interval will by construction include the true value of the parameter with a probability of at least @xmath15 .",
    "the procedure described above for constructing a confidence interval by inverting a test is not unique , however , because there are ( often infinitely ) many different subsets of the data space that could be chosen for the test s critical region @xmath6 .",
    "this is usually selected such that the probability to find @xmath16 is large if a given alternative hypothesis ( or set of alternatives ) is true .",
    "the _ power _ of the test with respect to an alternative value of the parameter @xmath17 , which we denote here as @xmath18 , is    @xmath19    if the test of @xmath4 is formulated using a @xmath12-value , such that finding @xmath20 is equivalent to finding @xmath21 , then the power can be written equivalently as    @xmath22    often the power with respect to certain alternatives is used as the criterion according to which one chooses the critical region of a test .",
    "confidence intervals obtained from inverting the test thus depend on this choice . for the present discussion ,",
    "however , we will assume that the test has been defined , and the power will be used only to modify the resulting confidence interval so that it does not exclude parameter values to which one does not have sufficient sensitivity .",
    "this concept is defined more quantitatively in the following section .",
    "when testing a hypothesized strength parameter @xmath4 , it may be that the magnitude of the signal implied by @xmath4 is extremely small  so small , that the probabilities for the data are very close to what they would be in the absence of the signal process , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "in such a case one has little or no sensitivity to the given value of @xmath4 .    for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : nosens ] illustrates a situation where there is only a very small level of sensitivity to a given strength parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the plot shows the pdfs of the statistic @xmath10 under assumption of strength parameters @xmath4 , and also assuming @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath25 .",
    "if the observed value of the statistic is found in the critical region corresponding to the top 5% of @xmath14 , then the hypothesized @xmath4 is rejected .",
    "but as the two pdfs almost coincide , the probability to reject @xmath4 if the true strength parameter is zero is also close to @xmath9 .",
    "( 10.0,6 . )",
    "( 0.6,-0.5 )    ( 8.1,-0.5 )    ( 0.1,5.)(a ) ( 14.8,5.)(b )    figure  [ fig : nosens](b ) shows the same distributions as ( a ) but for a different value of @xmath4 .",
    "the size of the test is , as in ( a ) , equal to @xmath7 . here",
    ", however , the distribution of @xmath10 under the assumption of @xmath26 leads to a substantially greater probability to reject @xmath4 , i.e. , to find @xmath10 in the critical region .",
    "the sensitivity of a test of @xmath4 can be quantified using the power of the test with respect to a stated alternative @xmath17 , which we will take here to be the no - signal hypothesis , @xmath26 . in the case where the pdfs @xmath14 and @xmath25 coincide , the probability to reject @xmath4 assuming the alternative @xmath27 approaches the significance level of the test , @xmath7 .    in the context of a search for a new phenomenon ,",
    "this means that with probability not less than @xmath7 one will exclude hypotheses to which one has little or no sensitivity , which we refer to here as spurious exclusion .",
    "the hypothesis might indeed be false , but if it is excluded , this is more naturally interpreted as a data fluctuation away from the region favoured under assumption of @xmath4 .",
    "this could result , for example , in a search for a hypothetical particle with a mass far above the range where it would have a noticeable impact on the data .",
    "particle physics experiments often carry out many searches covering a broad parameter range for many signal models , and so spurious exclusion is in fact a problem that can arise often .",
    "the problem of spurious exclusion , or equivalently , having a `` lucky '' statistical fluctuation lead to an anomalously strong limit , has been known in the particle physics community for many years . the note by highland @xcite reviews the problem and proposes several possible solutions ; further discussion can be found in the review on statistics by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "the problem received particular focus during searches for the higgs boson at the lep collider in the 1990s , and led to a procedure called `` @xmath0 '' @xcite .",
    "here one forms the ratio    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the @xmath12-values of the hypothesized strength parameter values @xmath4 and @xmath31 , respectively . in the @xmath0 procedure , @xmath4 is deemed to be excluded if one finds @xmath32 . because @xmath33 is aways greater than @xmath29 , the probability of exclusion assuming @xmath4 is necessarily less than @xmath7 .",
    "thus the quoted upper limit from the @xmath0 procedure will be greater than the upper limit according to the method of sec .",
    "[ sec : confint ] , and in this sense the @xmath0 procedure is said to be conservative .",
    "this is illustrated in the example described in sec .",
    "[ sec : gausslim ] .",
    "because of this conservatism , the frequentist coverage probability of the @xmath0 upper limits ( i.e. , the probability under assumption of @xmath4 that the interval will contain @xmath4 ) is not equal to @xmath7 , but is in general larger .",
    "although the exact coverage probabilities of @xmath0 intervals can be found as a function of @xmath4 , this is not often reported .",
    "here we propose an alternate procedure for producing intervals whose coverage properties are easily apparent for all values of @xmath4 . to do this we break the range of @xmath4 to be tested into two categories based on the power @xmath34 of a test of @xmath4 with respect to the no - signal alternative , @xmath27 .",
    "if this power is below a specified threshold @xmath35 , one s sensitivity to this parameter is deemed to be too low and the point is not regarded as testable . if the power is greater than or equal to the threshold , then the test of size @xmath7 is carried out .",
    "a value of @xmath4 is excluded if    1 .",
    "the value @xmath4 is rejected by the test , i.e. , @xmath16 or equivalently @xmath20 , and 2 .",
    "one has sufficient sensitivity to @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "an interval is constructed from the values of @xmath4 not excluded .",
    "if this is done on the basis of the test ( a ) only , it is referred to here as an _ unconstrained _ interval .",
    "application of the _ power constraint _",
    "( b ) results in the power - constrained interval or limit .",
    "the coverage probability of the power - constrained interval is @xmath37 for @xmath4 values that have power below @xmath35 , and @xmath7 for those values with power greater than or equal to the threshold . when reporting the result it is recommended to indicate which parameter values were above and which below the power - constraint threshold , and in this way one can easily see what the coverage probability is for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "the choice of the minimum power threshold is a matter of convention .",
    "we prefer to use @xmath38 , or more precisely , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the standard normal cumulative distribution ( i.e. , the cumulative distribution for gaussian with a mean of zero and unit standard deviation ) .",
    "as shown below , this corresponds to applying the power constraint if the unconstrained limit fluctuates one standard deviation below its median value under the background - only hypothesis .",
    "this procedure bears some similarity to one introduced recently in the astrophysics community in ref .",
    "@xcite , although there the power refers to a test of the background - only ( @xmath41 ) hypothesis , and furthermore the result is not used in quite the same way as what we propose here . note also in ref .",
    "@xcite , `` upper bound '' is similar to what we call an upper limit , and their term `` upper limit '' is taken to refer to the sensitivity threshold .",
    "formally , to construct the interval for @xmath4 one begins by finding the power for a test of each @xmath4 with respect to the alternative @xmath27 ,    @xmath42    in some problems this can be found in closed form ; otherwise it can be obtained using a monte carlo calculation , in which one for every value of @xmath4 calculates the distribution of @xmath29 using data generated according to @xmath41 .",
    "the value @xmath34 is then found simply by integrating each distribution from zero up to the desired significance level @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xmath43 ) .",
    "an equivalent and in ways simpler procedure is first to carry out the statistical test without the power constraint , and invert this to find the unconstrained confidence interval for @xmath4 .",
    "some of the parameter values that are excluded from this interval may be found to have a power below the required threshold , and they are then re - included in the power - constrained interval , which is thus by construction a superset of the unconstrained one .",
    "for example , one may be interested in finding an an upper limit , @xmath44 , i.e. , the largest value of @xmath4 not excluded . by inverting the test",
    ", one determines @xmath44 as a function of the data .",
    "one can therefore determine the distribution of @xmath44 , e.g. , by simulating the experiment many times under assumption of @xmath41 and constructing a histogram of @xmath44 for each outcome .",
    "then for each value of @xmath4 one determines the corresponding power .",
    "this is the probability , under assumption of the background - only ( @xmath41 ) hypothesis , to reject @xmath4 , i.e. , to find @xmath4 outside of the unconstrained confidence interval . in the case of an upper limit",
    "this is    @xmath45    one should note the following caveat : it can be that for certain data outcomes , all values of @xmath4 are excluded by the test , in which case @xmath44 is not defined .",
    "in such cases one must count the outcomes as contributing to the probability that @xmath4 is outside the confidence interval .    with this in mind , one can then find the smallest value of @xmath4 for which the power @xmath46 is at least equal to the minimum value @xmath35 , denoted here as @xmath47 . the power - constrained limit @xmath48 is given by the larger of the unconstrained limit @xmath44 or the minimum value to which one has sensitivity , @xmath47 :    @xmath49",
    "often the test of @xmath4 is based on a gaussian distributed measurement .",
    "for example , for a sufficiently large data sample and under conditions often satisfied in practice , the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath50 has a gaussian form with standard deviation @xmath51 and is centred about the true @xmath4 . here",
    "we will assume this is the case and further take @xmath51 to be known .",
    "for the case of an upper limit , we define the critical region to contain the lowest values of @xmath50 such that the probability to find @xmath50 there is equal to @xmath7 . for gaussian",
    "distributed @xmath50 with mean @xmath4 and standard deviation @xmath51 , the critical region is therefore    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the inverse of the standard gaussian cumulative distribution ( the standard normal quantile ) .",
    "for example , @xmath9 gives @xmath54 .",
    "rejecting @xmath4 if the data are in the critical region gives the unconstrained upper limit ,    @xmath55    the power of the test of @xmath4 with respect to the alternative @xmath26 is    @xmath56    because @xmath50 here follows a gaussian distribution , the power can be written    @xmath57    this is illustrated in fig .",

    "we will refer to a fluctuation at this level as @xmath72 ( downward ) , regardless of the distribution of @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , the distribution of @xmath44 often is close to gaussian so the terminology is natural and convenient .",
    "this choice of @xmath35 can be motivated by the idea that a sufficiently small fluctuation should not result in spurious exclusion of the type that the pcl and @xmath0 procedures are intended to prevent .",
    "if , for example , one were to require @xmath73 , then one would impose the power constraint whenever the observed limit is found below the median , i.e. , half of the time , which is not consistent with the notion of accepting small fluctuations .",
    "therefore we feel requiring a power of 50% is too extreme .    on the other hand , for any ( unbiased ) test",
    ", the power is always greater than or equal to the significance level @xmath7 .",
    "so if one were to take @xmath74 then the result is the same as the unconstrained limit .",
    "since one often takes @xmath9 , taking @xmath75 would correspond to a @xmath76 downward fluctuation ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) .",
    "sensitivity to the parameter @xmath4 corresponds having a power @xmath34 substantially larger than the significance level @xmath7",
    ". therefore one would like to take @xmath35 large with respect to @xmath7 , while still allowing for moderate a downward fluction of the limit before imposing the power constraint .",
    "we therefore believe @xmath78 is a natural choice for use with @xmath9 .",
    "this allows for fluctuations up to the one - sigma level before imposing the power constraint , and the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath38 is sufficient to ensure a reasonable sensitivity .",
    "if one were to take , e.g. , @xmath79 , as is done in some analyses , then one may consider that a somewhat larger @xmath35 is appropriate .",
    "in many searches for new phenomena , one may carry out the analysis for a range of parameters in the signal model .",
    "for example , when searching for the higgs boson one may carry out the analysis for each value of the mass @xmath80 .",
    "in this situation one can simply repeat the power - constraint procedure for each value of the signal model s parameters , as is illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : pclband ] represents a possible outcome for the unconstrained limit @xmath44 .",
    "the minimum power is taken to be @xmath81 , and thus the power - constrained limit is the greater of the dotted and lower dashed curves , as indicated by the shaded curve .",
    "in many analyses , the probability model that describes the data is not uniquely specified by the parameter ( or parameters ) of interest , but rather also contains nuisance parameters .",
    "that is , the values of these parameters are not known a priori and they must be fitted using the data . for concreteness suppose the model is characterized by a strength parameter @xmath4 and a set of nuisance parameters @xmath82 .",
    "the nuisance parameters complicate the present problem in two ways .",
    "first , they make it difficult to construct an unconstrained interval for the parameter of interest that has the correct coverage probability for all values of @xmath83 .",
    "this problem has been widely discussed in recent years , e.g. , ref .",
    "many of the proposed procedures give intervals with correct coverage for some values of @xmath83 , but approximate coverage elsewhere .",
    "for example , an approximate solution based on the profile likelihood ratio test is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the present discussion",
    "we will assume that a test procedure that gives an unconstrained interval has been chosen .",
    "its coverage probability may or may not be exactly equal to the nominal confidence level for all values of @xmath83 .    of more direct concern for the present paper is the fact that the power of the test of @xmath4 with respect to the no - signal alternative will depend in general on the nuisance parameters @xmath83 .",
    "as the power is intended to represent the probability , under assumption of the no - signal model , to reject a given value of @xmath4 , we take the values of @xmath83 that are in best agreement with the actual data under assumption of @xmath41 .",
    "we denote these as @xmath84 , i.e. , they are the conditional estimators for @xmath83 under assumption of @xmath41 .    as a consequence of this choice ,",
    "the power @xmath46 becomes a function of the actual data , since the data are used to determine values for the nuisance parameters .",
    "thus the range of @xmath4 values where one has sufficient sensitivity also depends to some extent on the data .",
    "this may seem counter - intuitive , since the power of a specific test , i.e. , at a given point in @xmath85-space , is independent of the data .",
    "but there is a certain power @xmath46 for every point in @xmath83-space , and one uses the data to choose the point at which one quotes the power .    alternatively , one could require that the power is greater than or equal to the minimum threshold for all values of the nuisance parameters in a specified range .",
    "in this way the set of @xmath4 values for which one has sufficient sensitivity would not depend on the data . as this would entail considerable computational effort",
    ", however , we prefer to define the power using a specific point in the nuisance - parameter space as described above .",
    "we propose a power - constraint procedure for modifying confidence limits so that parameter values to which one has little or no sensitivity are not excluded .",
    "the sensitivity is measured using the power of the test of the parameter with respect to the no - signal alternative .",
    "the coverage probability of the resulting limits is equal to the nominal confidence level ( e.g. , 95% ) for parameter values to which one s sensitivity is above a given threshold , and 100% if the sensitivity is below the threshold .",
    "this can be contrasted with the @xmath0 procedure , for which the coverage probability is always greater than the nominal confidence level by an amount that varies continuously as a function of the assumed parameter value .",
    "the power used for the sensitivity threshold is a matter of convention , but we recommend taking this to be @xmath86 .",
    "this is consistent with allowing for reasonably small downward fluctuations of the data by drawing the boundary at the one - sigma level .",
    "allowing more than @xmath76 fluctuations would mean the power constraint is never imposed ( for a 95% confidence level limit ) , and requiring @xmath87 would impose the power constraint half of the time , including cases with only an infinitesimal downward fluctuation .",
    "the pcl procedure is easily extended to problems with nuisance parameters . there",
    "we define the power with respect to the background - only ( @xmath41 ) model using the conditional estimates of the nuisance parameters given @xmath41 .",
    "the pcl procedure is particularly useful in cases where spurious exclusion is problematic , such as when a one - sided test is inverted to give an upper limit .",
    "it can be applied , however , to any confidence interval , including those based on inversion of a likelihood - ratio test ( i.e. , feldman - cousins intervals @xcite ) .",
    "when reporting results , we recommend to show both the constrained and unconstrained limits . in this way one can know whether a given parameter value is not rejected because the data are in good agreement with it , or rather because it is a value to which the sensitivity is deemed to low to allow exclusion .",
