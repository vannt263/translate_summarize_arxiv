    "the tunnel coupling to superconducting reservoirs can induce superconducting correlations in quantum dots.@xcite interesting linear- and nonlinear transport effects arising from andreev reflection@xcite can be studied in hybrid normal - superconducting systems comprising quantum dots in the presence of strong coulomb interaction . during the past years , there has been tremendous experimental progress in coupling quantum dots to superconductors.@xcite prominent examples include the observation of @xmath2  transitions in a josephson junction@xcite and splitting of cooper pairs.@xcite    an exact theoretical treatment of the transport properties of such devices requires to account for coulomb interaction , superconducting correlations , and non - equilibrium at the same time . to circumvent this challenge ,",
    "various approximation schemes have been proposed . in the case of vanishing coulomb interaction ,",
    "an exact solution can be obtained within a scattering approach.@xcite as a first step beyond , coulomb interaction has been treated perturbatively,@xcite which , however , is not justified for the large charging energies that are typical for small quantum dots . an alternative possibility is to allow for strong coulomb interaction but perform a perturbation expansion in the strength of the tunnel coupling between dot and leads.@xcite however , in the limit of an infinitely - large superconducting gap , an exact treatment of both the coulomb interaction and the tunnel coupling between quantum dot and superconducting leads is possible .",
    "@xcite in this case , quasiparticle tunneling is completely suppressed and transport from and to the superconducting leads is fully sustained by cooper pairs .",
    "the formation of andreev - bound states ( abss ) in the quantum dot indicates that superconducting correlations are induced via the proximity to superconducting leads .",
    "the dependence of the abs energies on the quantum dot s level position is directly reflected in the transport spectrum of the system .    a diagrammatic real - time approach to nonequilibrium transport through quantum dots coupled both to normal and superconducting leads has been introduced in ref .  .",
    "this method has been applied in the limit of an infinitely - large superconducting gap , @xmath3 , to study a variety of transport phenomena in different quantum - dot setups , @xcite including , for example , pure spin - current generation,@xcite shot - noise suppression,@xcite cooper - pair splitting,@xcite and time - dependent driving.@xcite in this limit , both the charging energy and the coupling to the superconducting leads can be treated nonperturbatively by the diagrammatic technique and a perturbation expansion is only performed in the coupling to the normal - conducting reservoirs .    the calculations in the infinite - gap limit neglect quasiparticle contributions to transport .",
    "they , furthermore , approximate the abs energies since the latter are a function of the superconducting gap . in the experiments ,",
    "the superconducting gap @xmath0 is often of the same order of magnitude as other energy scales such as charging energy or tunnel - coupling strength .",
    "for this reason , it is quite natural to investigate the quality of the approximation introduced by considering the infinite - gap limit",
    ". this is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the effect of next - to - lowest order corrections in the tunnel coupling to the normal leads .",
    "a finite superconducting gap in the leads affects the andreev and josephson transport through quantum dots in two ways .",
    "first , it modifies the abss .",
    "this affects the position of bias or gate voltages at which a new transport channel is opened .",
    "second , the value of the current away from these threshold voltages is changed . to address the effect of a finite @xmath0 , we start by performing a systematic expansion in @xmath1 around @xmath4 .",
    "exemplarily , we will focus on a quantum dot tunnel coupled to one normal and two superconducting reservoirs and compare the currents obtained by the @xmath1 expansion with the @xmath4 limit.@xcite since we only focus on the dc josephson current we assume the two superconductors to be on the same chemical potential and , thus , the subgap structure expected from multiple andreev reflection processes@xcite does not occur .",
    "we find that away from the threshold voltages , both the andreev and the josephson currents are hardly modified , i.e. , the @xmath4 limit provides quite an accurate description of subgap transport .",
    "the @xmath1 expansion , furthermore , indicates a renormalization of the abs energies .",
    "it can , however , only predict the direction towards which the energies are shifted . to determine the position of the abs for finite values of @xmath0 we perform , as an alternative approximation scheme , a partial resummation of diagrams .",
    "the results within this approach are considerably more accurate than those obtained by a simple hartree - fock treatment and compare favorably with the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) data of martn - rodero and levy yeyati.@xcite    finally , we present ( for the @xmath4 limit ) results from a systematic perturbation expansion to next - to - lowest order in the tunnel coupling to the normal leads . in this way",
    ", we go beyond the regime of weak tunnel coupling but do not cover kondo correlations.@xcite we find that the next - to - leading - order correction leads to a renormalization of the gate - voltage position at which a @xmath2  transition occurs in the josephson current .",

    "second , we find peaks at the positions of the abss in the @xmath1 correction to the current . while the peaks themselves are artefacts of the @xmath1 expansion , they carry important physical information about the renormalization of the abss as compared to their @xmath4 value .",

    "in the previous section we have discussed how a finite superconducting gap in the leads renormalizes the abss of a quantum dot weakly tunnel - coupled to a normal lead .",
    "now , we want to address the influence of the tunnel coupling to the normal lead beyond the weak - coupling limit . for this",
    ", we go back to @xmath121 but include next - to - leading order corrections in @xmath51 . to distinguish the contributions of different order in @xmath51",
    ", we introduce in the following an index @xmath161 for @xmath132-th order .",
    "we study the josephson and the andreev current as well as the average charge of the quantum dot . within a perturbation expansion ,",
    "they start to zeroth , first , and zeroth order , respectively , i.e. , the next - to - leading order corrections are of first , second , and first order , respectively . to evaluate them we have to include diagrams with two tunneling lines from the normal lead .",
    "this increases the number of diagrams considerably and we generate and evaluate them by means of a computer code . at this point",
    ", we would like to emphasize that although the josephson current starts in zeroth order in the coupling to the normal lead , it still depends on the chemical potential of the normal lead for the following reason . according to eq .",
    ", the zeroth - order josephson current is given as a product of the zeroth - order current rates and the zeroth - order elements of the reduced density matrix .",
    "to calculate the latter , it is necessary to expand the generalized master equation , see eq .  , up to first order in @xmath51 , so that the chemical potential of the normal lead enters the zeroth - order density - matrix elements and , thus , the zeroth - order josephson current .",
    "it is natural for a systematic perturbation expansion in a small parameter that higher - order corrections are quantitatively small .",
    "therefore , we focus , in the following , on qualitative features that appear in the region close to the point of zero detuning @xmath162 when going beyond the weak - coupling limit . around zero detuning ,",
    "the weights of the states @xmath163 and @xmath41 entering the coherent superpositions @xmath164 become equal , indicating a large proximization of the quantum dot . for bias voltages large enough such that the quantum dot has a finite probability to be either empty or doubly occupied , josephson and andreev currents set in .",
    "to lowest order in the tunnel coupling to the normal lead , zero detuning defines a resonance condition between dot and superconductors , visible in the josephson current , the andreev current , and the average charge .",
    "the inclusion of next - order corrections shifts the resonance condition which can be interpreted as a renormalization of the energy difference between empty and doubly occupied dot .    in the regime of large bias voltage ,",
    "the josephson current changes sign as function of the quantum dot s level position @xmath18 .",
    "this indicates a transition from a @xmath165- to a @xmath166-junction behavior . in the limit @xmath4 and weak tunnel coupling to the normal lead,@xcite",
    "this @xmath2  transition happens exactly at zero detuning , @xmath167 , and then bends when the bias voltage approaches the highest abs , see fig .",
    "[ density - plot - josephson ] .",
    "when including the next - order correction in @xmath51 , the position of this @xmath2  transition becomes renormalized , see fig .",
    "[ renormalizations ]  ( a ) .",
    "the origin of this renormalization can be understood in terms of an effective , tunnel - coupling induced field that acts on the isospin introduced in eq .",
    "( [ isospin_definition ] ) .",
    "a finite bias voltage leads to the generation of the @xmath168-component of the isospin .",
    "the tunnel coupling to the superconductors leads to an effective field along the @xmath169-direction .",
    "this causes the isospin to rotate and acquire a finite @xmath170-component . according to eq .",
    "( [ josephson_iso ] ) , however , a finite @xmath169-component of the isospin is needed for a josephson current .",
    "this is accomplished with an additional finite @xmath168-component of the effective field .",
    "to lowest order , this component is given by the detuning , @xmath171 , which explains the position of the @xmath2  transition in fig .",
    "[ density - plot - josephson ]",
    ". the next - order correction , @xmath172 , renormalizes this position .",

    "the chosen parameters are @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath111 . in ( a ) the @xmath166  junctions are indicated by the symbol @xmath166 .",
    "the thin black lines in both plots show the position of the abss and @xmath176 marks the coulomb - blockaded area between the two inner abss .",

    "the thin black lines in both plots show the position of the abss and @xmath176 marks the coulomb - blockaded area between the two inner abss .",
    "[ renormalizations],title=\"fig : \" ]    we remark that this renormalization of the @xmath2  transition has already been predicted in ref .  , in which the tunnel couplings to both the superconductors and the normal leads as well as the detuning @xmath177 have been simultaneously treated as small parameters ,",
    "i.e. , the systematic perturbation expansion included already both @xmath178 and @xmath172 .",
    "on the other hand , the formation of abss could not be treated in that expansion . in ref .",
    ", on the other hand , no constraints were put on @xmath126 and @xmath177 , i.e. , the abss could be described , but the renormalization @xmath172 did not contribute to lowest order in @xmath51 . only the present calculation , with arbitrary @xmath126 and @xmath177 and next - to - leading order on @xmath51 enables us to address both the abss and the renormalization of the position of the @xmath2  transition .",
    "while the josephson current changes sign at small detuning , the andreev current becomes extremal as a function of @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "[ density - plot - andreev ] . in fig .",
    "[ renormalizations ]  ( b ) we show the position of this extremum in the @xmath18-@xmath179-plane .",
    "( we do not show the position of the extremum in the coulomb - blockade regime since there the current is exponentially suppressed ) .",
    "to lowest order and for large bias voltage , the extremum is at zero detuning .",
    "the next - order correction , however , leads to a renormalization of this position , for the same reason as the renormalization of the @xmath2  transition in the josephson current .",
    "finally , we address the average quantum dot charge @xmath180 , which is related to the @xmath168-component of the isospin via @xmath181 .",
    "again , we focus on the region of small detuning where the proximity effect is most pronounced . in the coulomb - blockade regime ( at small bias voltage ) , the dot is preferably singly occupied , @xmath182 .",
    "a larger bias voltage has the tendency to inject a second electron into the quantum dot .",
    "superconducting correlations , however , mix the states of empty and double occupation and , thus , reduce the average number of electrons . for zero detuning @xmath177 and to zeroth order in @xmath51 , the charge @xmath180 remains @xmath183 even for large bias voltage .",
    "only when increasing @xmath184 the number of charges increases above @xmath185 . in the intermediate - bias regime for finite detuning values",
    "the average charge tends towards @xmath165 or @xmath186 , depending on the sign of the detuning .",
    "this effect can easily be understood by looking at the eigenstates @xmath164 : in the intermediate - bias regime for positive values of @xmath179 , i.e. @xmath187 , the state @xmath188 can already be excited while state @xmath189 is still inaccessible . from the definition of state @xmath188",
    "it follows that a positive ( negative ) detuning causes the weight of the zero component to dominate over ( be dominated by ) the double component resulting in an decrease ( increase ) of the average number of electrons .    , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the thin black lines show the position of the abss and @xmath176 marks the coulomb - blockaded area between the two inner abss .",
    "[ averagedotcharge ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ averagedotcharge ] we show the position of @xmath190 , or equivalently @xmath191 , for both zeroth and first order .",
    "( we do not plot the position in the coulomb - blockade regime . ) as discussed above , the position of @xmath192 is at zero detuning in the large - bias regime and splits in the intermediate - bias regime , with @xmath193 between and @xmath194 outside the two lines . when including the next - order correction , the situation changes .",
    "now , the line of @xmath195/(-e)=1 $ ] is split even for the large - bias regime , opening a region with @xmath195/(-e)<1 $ ] in between . to understand this ,",
    "we analyze @xmath196 at zero detuning , @xmath197 .",
    "solving the generalized master equation@xcite immediately yields @xmath198 and @xmath199 , where @xmath200 and @xmath201 , \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\gamma_n}{4 \\pi } \\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\epsilon_{a}^{2 } } } \\sum_{\\gamma,\\gamma'=\\pm } \\mathrm{re}\\left [ \\psi\\left ( \\frac{1}{2 } + i \\frac{e_{a,\\gamma',\\gamma } -\\mu_n}{2\\pi k_b t } \\right ) \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath202 are generalized rates in first order in @xmath51 and @xmath203 is the digamma function .",
    "it is , thus , the isospin generation term @xmath204 , describing combined andreev processes that involve both the normal and the superconducting leads , which reduce @xmath205 below @xmath185 .",
    "the theoretical description of sub - gap ( josephson and andreev ) transport through quantum dots with strong coulomb interaction coupled to normal and superconducting leads simplifies substantially in the limit of infinitely - large superconducting gap @xmath0 and weak tunnel coupling @xmath51 to the normal lead . for experimental devices with finite @xmath0 and larger @xmath51 outside the kondo regime ,",
    "these calculations may still be used as an approximation .",
    "the assessment of the quality of this approximation to describe sub - gap transport has been the focus of this paper . in particular",
    "we came to the following conclusions .",
    "the position of the abss strongly depend on @xmath0 , i.e. , a @xmath4 approximation is insufficient .",
    "these abss define threshold voltages in the current - voltage characteristics at which new transport channels open .",
    "the numerical values for the josephson and andreev current between these threshold voltages , however , seem to be nicely approximated by the @xmath4 limit .",
    "similarly , we find that the next - to - leading order correction in the tunnel coupling @xmath51 to the normal lead mainly yields small quantitative corrections .",
    "but there are also qualitative differences : the position of the @xmath2  transition in the josephson current and the peak positions in the andreev current are shifted .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that the @xmath4 and weak - coupling calculations provide a very good approximation for sub - gap transport with the limitation that the positions of the abss for finite @xmath0 are not properly described . to address the latter , we proposed a resummation approach that substantially improves over mean - field treatments and favorably compares with more elaborate nrg calculations .    d.f . appreciates the hospitality of the victoria university of wellington . financial support from dfg via ko 1987/5 is gratefully acknowledged .",
