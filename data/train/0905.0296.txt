    "finding efficient ways of distributing ( or collecting ) matter injected through a given region , spanned , e.g. , by a regular lattice , from ( at ) a unique source ( sink ) is relevant to a variety of problems arising both for natural and artificial systems .",
    "the main mechanisms that are known to achieve a capillary distribution are by diffusion or through a network - like structure providing a near uniform spatial supply ( drainage ) , or a combination of them .",
    "network arrangements , of this kind , are observed in many living organisms , like for instance circulatory and lymphatic systems in animals or xylem and roots in vascular plants , and are also widely employed in artificial systems such as electrical or hydraulic transmissions and fluvial basins @xcite .",
    "certainly , one wonders what is the basic selection principle that favors , say , tree - like versus looping network structures , in view of the widespread occurrence of both forms in nature and elsewhere @xcite @xcite . to that end , it has been previously shown that tree - like structures emerge as local minima of global energy expenditure in networks whose transportation cost is physically constrained to be a concave function , such as in the case of river networks @xcite .",
    "transportation costs generally depend on the strength of currents and on network topology .",
    "the best known example is the electrical resistor network @xcite : consider a square lattice where a resistor is placed at every bond between each pair of nearest - neighbor nodes .",
    "each node is externally supplied by a unit flux .",
    "if a sink collects all the currents , one is capable of controlling the current fluxes in all bonds by assigning the potential differences between pairs of nodes . the total cost in the transportation  the dissipated power  is proportional by ohm s law to the sum of the square of currents : @xmath3 .",
    "optimal resistor networks are thus obtained by setting the potentials in order to minimize the total transportation cost . the most immediate way to generalize",
    "the resistor network case is to replace the exponent  @xmath4 \" by a generic exponent @xmath5 .",
    "+ the case @xmath6 has been characterized exactly @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that the cost function admits many local minima corresponding to configurations with currents present only on the bonds of spanning trees @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath7 exhibits scaling behavior akin to river networks @xcite .",
    "+ the case @xmath8 is related to the voter model @xcite , mass aggregation @xcite , directed sandpile models @xcite , and kleiber s law of metabolic scaling of living organism @xcite .",
    "recently optimal transportation networks with a global constraint have been studied in a variety of contexts @xcite , where different topologies of the optimal transportation network arising in the cases @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been investigated also by bohm and magnasco @xcite .",
    "+ the case @xmath10 is an example of convex transportation costs .",
    "important real - world examples are found , for example , in road traffic analyses where more cars cause disproportionately higher costs ( travel times ) , usually modeled as convex functions or in any electricity distribution network owing to ohm s law .",
    "convex cost functions also occur in many operations research applications as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "here we address the current distribution for the case corresponding to a general convex cost function of the circulating currents : @xmath11 where the sum spans all network bonds @xmath12 . in specific examples and numerical simulations",
    "we will consider the particular class of convex functionals with @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "it will be shown , however , that our findings are valid for an arbitrary convex cost function @xmath14 with finite first derivative which depends only on current strength .",
    "notice that for a non - linear resistor network the transportation cost @xmath15 is proportional to the dissipated power only for the case @xmath16 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will focus here only on finite networks .",
    "the goal is to determine the current probability distribution corresponding to the current configuration @xmath17 which minimizes the total transportation cost @xmath15 in the large size limit and its scaling behavior as a function of the cost @xmath18 .",
    "+ the minimization of @xmath15 is subject to the local constraints of current conservation at each node @xmath19 : the sum of all currents flowing into a node , taken as negative ( positive ) if directed outward ( inward ) , must equal the injected nodal flux , @xmath20 ( see fig .",

    "the sum of all currents flowing into node @xmath19 must be equal to the sum of currents flowing out of node @xmath19 : @xmath21.,height=207 ]    because such constraint is linear in the @xmath22s , if @xmath15 is a convex function then it admits a single global minimum .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of the solution for infinite networks have been addressed elsewhere @xcite . +",
    "as shown below , we find quite generally that the cumulative probability distribution function ( cpdf ) , i.e. , the fraction of currents @xmath23 larger than @xmath24 , obeys the finite  size scaling @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the linear size of the system and @xmath27 is the scaling function which at large @xmath19 behaves as @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this scaling form holds independently of the particular convex cost function considered . the standard scaling behavior for the case @xmath13 and @xmath31 @xcite corresponding to a non - convex cost function , was instead found to be : @xmath32 with @xmath33 const , i.e. , a pure power law is obtained in the large size limit ( @xmath34 in @xmath2 and @xmath7 ) .",

    "( [ 001 ] ) in the continuum there are at least two natural choices .",
    "the first choice corresponds to @xmath111 whereas the second one is given by : @xmath112 it can be shown that , although these two functionals have different optimal configurations , their cpdf have the same scaling behavior for small and large currents .",

    "imposing current conservation we get @xmath119 leading again to solution ( [ 8 ] ) . in turn",
    "this implies that the scaling behavior of the cpdf as defined in eq.([9 ] ) is independent of the specific cost function as long as it remains convex .",
    "we have further tested the robustness of our results by performing additional numerical simulations on systems subject to independent , equally distributed random current injection , @xmath120 at the nodes , or in the presence of non  uniform conductivity where the cost function is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 are random positive numbers . + as random distribution for injections and conductances we have chosen a power law to ensure a high degree of inhomogeneity .",
    "the simulation results of fig . [ rand ] show that the leading trend for large currents remains the same as in the uniform case studied above .",
    "thus it is plausible that the scaling behavior of the current distribution corresponding to the optimal solution of the uniform case might remain the same even for the more general case of a spatially varying convex cost function .",
