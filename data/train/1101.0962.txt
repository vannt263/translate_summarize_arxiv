    "<S> we find that the bethe - ansatz based density - functional theory is computationally easy and yields an accurate description of the ground - state properties for weak - to - intermediate interaction strength , different fillings , and confinements . in order to characterize the quantum phase transition in the presence of a harmonic confinement , we calculate the thermodynamic stiffness , the density - functional fidelity , and fidelity susceptibility , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that with the increase of the number of particles or attractive interaction strength , the system can be driven from the luther - emery - type phase to the composite phase of luther - emery - like in the wings and insulating - like in the center . </S>"
