    "this is a challenging problem , one that is likely to generate some interesting mathematics .",
    "we might consider modifying the problem by constraining the locations of the points in some way ; for instance , they could be restricted to lying on a square or triangular lattice . in this essay , we take up the question of covering the points of the square lattice :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",
    "for which @xmath2 is it possible to cover all the points of the square lattice with inter - point distance @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) with disks with pairwise - disjoint interior having radius 1 ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    call this lattice @xmath5 .",
    "the principal result of this essay is the following :    for all @xmath6\\bigcup \\left[\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{26}},\\infty\\right)$ ] , @xmath5 can be covered with unit disks with pairwise - disjoint interior .    note : unlike in @xcite , we consider _ closed _ disks of unit radius .    ]",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath7 , we can cover all the points of @xmath5 by giving each point its own disk .",
    "what about @xmath8 ?",
    "consider @xmath9 : a circle with unit radius circumscribes a square with side length @xmath10 , so we can cover all the points , four at a time , with unit disks :    ]    it is not hard to see that this same strategy will work for smaller values of @xmath3 ; the only thing we need to worry about is making sure the disks do not overlap .",

    "we codify this method in the form of a theorem .",
    "first we need a few definitions .",
    "the first is from @xcite .",

    "there is also the question of a lower bound . in @xcite , the authors argue that for @xmath44 , @xmath5 can not be covered with disjoint unit disks .",
    "the present authors believe the true lower bound to be closer to 1/2 .",
    "find a lower bound on @xmath45    naturally , we could also consider the triangular lattice .",
