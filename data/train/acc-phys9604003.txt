    "the last component of a muon collider facility , as presently envisioned@xcite , is a colliding - beam storage ring .",
    "design studies on various problems for this ring have been in progress over the past year@xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the current status of the design .",
    "the projected muon currents require very low beta values at the ip , @xmath1 in order to achieve the design luminosity of @xmath2 the beta values in the final - focus quadrupoles are roughly @xmath3 to cancel the corresponding chromaticities , sextupole schemes for local correction have been included in the optics of the experimental insertion@xcite .",
    "the _ hour - glass _ effect constraints the bunch length to be comparable to @xmath4 to obtain such short bunches with reasonable rf voltage requires a very small value of the momentum compaction @xmath5 which can be obtained by using flexible momentum compaction ( fmc ) modules in the arcs@xcite .",
    "a preliminary design of a complete collider ring has now been made ; it uses an experimental insertion and arc modules as described in refs.@xcite-@xcite as well as a utility insertion .",
    "the layout of this ring is shown schematically in fig.[fg1 ] ,    = 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    and its parameters are summarized in tb.[tb1 ] .     ? = ?",
    ".high energy - high luminosity @xmath0 collider .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      the utility insertion closely resembles the experimental insertion , except that the low - beta foci are relaxed in order to lower the beta - function maxima by a factor of about 1000 , see fig.[fg5 ] .",
    "this is done by relaxing the focusing in the two telescopes .",
    "the ccs section is the same as in the experimental insertion , except that the sextupoles are adjusted to cancel the total chromaticity of the utility insertion .",
    "further changes will probably be needed in the future to better accommodate requirements of injection , rf , and scraping .",
    "the variations of the fractional part of the global tunes @xmath6 as functions of @xmath7 are shown in fig.[fg6 ] .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    @xmath8 is essentially flat over a bandwidth of @xmath9 , but @xmath10 has non - linear components , although the variation of tune , peak to peak is less than @xmath11 within a bandwidth of @xmath12 to @xmath13 the next figures show the momentum dependences of @xmath14 ( fig.[fg7 ] ) , chromaticity ( fig.[fg8 ] ) , momentum compaction @xmath15 ( fig.[fg9 ] ) and of the amplitude dependent tune shifts @xmath16 ( fig.[fg10 ] ) .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm",
    "although the collider ring has been adjusted to be isochronous for the reference particle , the off - momentum particle will see a small nonzero momentum - compaction factor , which is defined to be @xmath17 the length of the closed orbit @xmath18 for an off - momentum particle can be expanded as a function of momentum offset @xmath19 , we write @xmath20,$ ] where @xmath21 is considered as a single variable . consequently , the momentum compaction seen by the off - momentum particle is @xmath22 therefore , for an isochronous ring , there is still a spread of momentum compaction @xmath23 .",
    "the first - order momentum compaction is determined by the dispersion function at the dipoles .",
    "the second - order momentum compaction , however , in addition to the contribution from the second - order dispersion function at the dipoles , contains an extra wiggling term .",
    "this wiggling term , equal to one half the average of the square of the derivative of the dispersion , is a measure of the additional path length due to the closed orbit wiggling in and out of the reference orbit .    for normal fodo cells",
    ", the dispersion wiggles between 0.65  m and 1.24  m from the defocusing quadrupole to the focusing quadrupole , for a total of 0.59  m ; for a fmc module , the dispersion oscillates between @xmath24  m and @xmath25  m , for a total of 3.25  m. as a result , the wiggling term is expected to be much larger .",
    "this eventually leads to a much larger @xmath21 than for a fodo cell .",
    "if the chromatic sextupoles at the ir are used to correct the chromaticities of the ir , while the sextupoles in arc modules correct chromaticities of the arc modules , then this isochronous ring has a momentum - compaction factor varying almost linearly with momentum ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 at @xmath28 , respectively , for a total spread of @xmath29 this is illustrated in fig.[fg11 ] .",
    "we can also see that @xmath21 is positive .",
    "= 6.0 cm = 7.0 cm    in order to have the muons remain bunched , a rather huge rf system will be necessary for such a large spread of momentum compaction .",
    "sextupoles affect @xmath21 .",
    "consider a fodo - cell system with sextupoles of strengths @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , at the focusing and defocusing quadrupoles .",
    "the change in second - order momentum compaction@xcite is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the first - order dispersions at the focusing and defocusing quadrupoles .",
    "we may expect the behavior to be similar for our arc modules .",
    "if both sextupoles are used to compensate for natural chromaticities , the one with @xmath30 will lower @xmath21 while the one with @xmath31 will increase it .",
    "therefore , we should first forget chromaticity correction and use only one sextupole of strength @xmath30 on each side of the lower - beta doublets where @xmath35 and dispersion is large . at this moment",
    ", each arc module has been tuned to have @xmath36 in order to maintain isochronocity of the whole ring . by adjusting the sextupole strength to the optimum value of @xmath37  m@xmath38 ,",
    "the momentum compaction of the arc module becomes @xmath39 when the momentum offset is @xmath28 .",
    "the variation of @xmath40 is plotted in fig.[fg12 ] and looks like a parabola , implying that @xmath21 has been adjusted to zero and what is left is the third - order contribution .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    the total swing of @xmath40 is now @xmath41 . from the shape of fig.[fg11 ] , the momentum - compaction factor of each module should have been adjusted instead to @xmath42 , so that eventually the spread of momentum compaction will become @xmath43 , which is acceptable for a moderate - size rf system .",
    "the introduction of this @xmath21-correction sextupoles bring the chromaticities ( here we denote chromaticity with the symbol @xmath44 ) of each arc module to @xmath45 to @xmath46 and @xmath47 to @xmath48 when the momentum offset varies from @xmath49 t0 @xmath50 , as illustrated in fig.[fg12 ] .",
    "there are 40 arc modules and they contribute therefore chromaticities of @xmath51 and @xmath52 to the whole collider ring . but",
    "these chromaticities are only very tiny compared with the @xmath53 units from the ir , and can be removed by making minor adjustment to the chromatic correction sextupoles of the ir .",
    "there will still be a spread of chromaticities as a function of momentum due to the arc modules , with a total of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    if the spread of momentum compaction and the spreads of chromaticities are still too large , we can construct another similar arc module that has a smaller dispersion wiggling .",
    "we have a design in fig.[fg13 ] that employs quadrupoles with strengths reduced roughly by 1/3 in the fodo regions , but almost doubled in the low - beta region .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    this module has a maximum and minimum dispersion of @xmath56  m and @xmath57  m. when its chromaticities are corrected to zero with focusing and defocusing sextupoles , it gives a total spread of @xmath40 equal to only @xmath58 when the momentum offset is @xmath28 , as shown in fig.[fg14 ] drawn in the same scale as fig.[fg12 ] .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    if only a pair of sextupoles @xmath30 is used to compensate for @xmath21 as in above , at the optimum sextupole strength of @xmath59  m@xmath38 , the spread of momentum compaction will only be @xmath60 , which is about 2.5 times less than the former arc module .",
    "= 6.5 cm = 7.0 cm    meanwhile , the chromaticities introduced are @xmath61 to @xmath62 and @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "both the chromaticities and their spreads are much smaller than the arc modules used in the present design .",
    "fig.[fg15 ] shows the momentum compaction and chromaticities for this module as a comparison with fig.[fg12 ] .",
    "a possible lattice for a muon collider has been described .",
    "the design satisfies most of the collider requirements , although it is not fully realistic .",
    "error and tolerance analyses are yet to be performed as well as tracking to determine the dynamic aperture and achievable luminosity .    in order to make the final - focus design realistic",
    ", drift spaces must be introduced between all magnet elements , and the lengths of the insertions will have to be increased in order to achieve the required dispersion values in the sextupoles with reasonable dipole fields .",
