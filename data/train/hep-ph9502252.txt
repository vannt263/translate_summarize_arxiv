    "it is well known that the @xmath0 process has the potential to put relevant constraints to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this comes mainly from two facts .",
    "first , as a fcnc process , the @xmath0 decay occurs only beyond the tree level , thus being sensitive to the characteristics of possible new particles circulating in the relevant loops .",
    "second , there are available experimental data on the exclusive @xcite @xmath5 and the inclusive @xcite @xmath6 decays that lead to upper and lower bounds on the branching ratio br(@xmath0 ) of the same order as the sm prediction . in particular , from the inclusive @xmath7 decay : @xmath8 br(@xmath0 ) @xmath9 .",
    "there has recently been a large amount of work discussing the prediction for br(@xmath0 ) in the sm and extensions of it , particularly in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "the latter scenario probably represents the most promising and theoretically well founded extension of the sm capable of giving new measurable physics @xcite . in it , besides the usual sm diagram with a @xmath10 gauge boson and a top quark in the loop , there are additional contributions coming from loops involving charged higgses ( @xmath11 ) and a top quark , charginos ( @xmath12 ) and u - type squarks ( of which the relevant contributions come from the stops , @xmath13 , and scharms , @xmath14 ) , and a gluino ( @xmath15 ) or neutralinos ( @xmath16 ) plus a d - type squark ( mainly @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the latter two diagrams do not contribute significantly to the br and can therefore be neglected .",
    "so we end up with the following expression for the branching ratio at next to leading order ( in units of the br for the semileptonic @xmath19 decay ) : @xmath20^{2}}{i(z ) } f \\label{br}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the phase space factor , @xmath24 stands for the leading logarithmic qcd corrections which have been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath25 contains nlo effects ( @xmath26 being the nlo correction to the semileptonic decay ) as our renormalization scale . for a discussion about the uncertainties derived from this election see ref .",

    "@xmath27 are the coefficients of the effective operators for the @xmath28 and @xmath29 interactions ; in our case , as mentioned before , we consider as relevant the contributions coming from the sm diagram plus those with top quark and charged higgs , and stops / scharms and charginos running in the loop .",

    "@xcite , and all the masses are understood to be at the electroweak scale . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the matrices which diagonalise the chargino mass matrix , while @xmath35 diagonalises the stop mass matrix .    as we can see from the former expressions ,",
    "it is not easy to draw general conclusions about the behaviour of these amplitudes due to their complicated dependence on the different masses and matrix elements .",
    "however , there are some general features which are worth mentioning : for example , both the sm and the charged higgs contributions have always the same sign , giving therefore a total amplitude which is bigger than the sm one",
    ". this fact has been used by several authors @xcite to impose severe restrictions on two higgs doublets models ( 2hdm ) ; in our case this effect is not as sharp due to the presence of the chargino contribution which , for a wide range of the parameter space , has opposite sign to that of the other two amplitudes . as we will see",
    "this is not enough , in general , to lower the total br below the sm prediction , although in some cases it might be possible to have such big values for @xmath36 as to drive the total br even below the cleo lower bound .    in the formulation of the mssm the mass matrices of charginos , charged higgses , stops , etc , appearing in the above expressions , are not independent parameters .",
    "they come as a low energy result of the actual initial parameters of the theory , which are assumed to be given at the unification scale , @xmath37 .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to correctly establish the constraints on these parameters from @xmath0 measurements .",
    "several recent papers have been concerned with this task @xcite . however , as we will see , the complete one  loop effects to be taken under consideration have not been always properly included , particularly in the works dealing with the minimal supergravity ( sugra ) scenario .",
    "a careful inclusion of these effects , especially the radiative electroweak breaking , is precisely the main goal of this article .",
    "in addition , most of the sugra analysis have just dealt with the minimal sugra scenario , which is only justified by its simplicity .",
    "in fact , this scenario has a naturalness problem , the so  called @xmath1problem , namely the origin of the electroweak size of the @xmath1 parameter in the superpotential ( see below ) . in recent times",
    ", however , there have appeared string and grand unification well motivated mechanisms to solve the @xmath1problem @xcite that imply a departure from minimal sugra .",
    "it is also the aim of this article to study the constraints on these scenarios coming from the @xmath0 process .    in section 2",
    "we introduce two supergravity scenarios , labelled sugra i and sugra ii , which correspond to the previously mentioned supergravity frameworks , and establish their connection to the mssm . in section 3",
    "we explain our approach to determine the restrictions on the mssm coming from the @xmath0 decay , focussing our attention on some one  loop refinements that have a substantial impact on the results .",
    "the numerical results for the supergravity scenarios under consideration and their implications are presented and discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the mssm is defined by the superpotential , @xmath10 , and the form of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "@xmath10 is given by [ w ] w=_i\\ { h_u_iq_i h_2 u_i^c + h_d_iq_i h_1 d_i^c + h_e_il_i h_1 e_i^c } + h_1 h_2 , where @xmath38 is a generation index , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are the scalar partners of the quark ( lepton ) su(2 ) doublets , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) are the quark ( lepton ) singlets and @xmath43 are the two susy higgs doublets ; the @xmath44factors are the yukawa couplings and @xmath1 is the usual higgs mixing parameter . in all terms of eq .",

    "@xcite , the sign of @xmath1 in the chargino mass matrix has been incorrectly written in ref .",
    "@xcite ; this is also the case for the other diagonal entry ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the same mistake with the @xmath1 sign occurs in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the signs of the chargino mass matrix have been consistently written in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the particular values of the soft breaking parameters @xmath55 depend on the type of sugra theory from which the mssm derives and on the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we will consider two types of sugra theories without specifying the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "* sugra i *    this is just the minimal supergravity theory .",
    "it is defined by a khler potential @xmath56 and a gauge kinetic function @xmath57 , so that all the kinetic terms are canonical , whereas the superpotential @xmath10 is assumed to be as in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , @xmath1 being an inicial parameter .",
    "then , irrespectively of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism , the gaugino and scalar masses are automatically universal and the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath7 are universal and related to each other by the well known relation [ abmin ] b = a - m .",
    "this supergravity theory is attractive for its simplicity and for the natural explanation that offers to the universality of the soft breaking terms . actually , universality is a desirable property not only to reduce the number of independent parameters , but also for phenomenological reasons , particularly to avoid unwanted fcnc and cp violating effects ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , this scenario has a serious drawback , namely the unnaturally small ( electroweak ) size of the initial @xmath1 parameter in the superpotential .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath1 problem , that leads us to the next supegravity scenario .",
    "* sugra ii *    recently , there have appeared several attractive mechanisms to solve the @xmath1 problem that , quite remarkably , lead to a similar prediction for the value of @xmath7 .",
    "very briefly , these are the following :    _ a ) _ : :    in ref .",
    "@xcite was noted that if the superpotential has a    non - renormalizable term of the form [ lamwo ] w_o h_1 h_2 , where    @xmath58 is the renormalizable superpotential and    @xmath59 an unknown coupling , then a @xmath1    term is automatically generated with size    @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath7 parameter can    also be straightforwardly evaluated .",
    "assuming that the khler    potential is as in minimal supergravity in order to guarantee    universal soft breaking terms , the simple result is [ abstr ] b=2 m .",
    "for    this mechanism to work , @xmath1 must be vanishing at the    renormalizable level , a fact that , remarkably enough , is automatically    guaranteed in the framework of string theories @xcite . on the other    hand , the existence of a non - renormalizable term as that of    eq .",
    "( [ lamwo ] ) is also quite natural in superstring theories ( see e.g.    ref .",
    "this is equivalent for practical purposes to the    presence of a term @xmath61 h.c . in the khler    potential , which resembles very much the mechanism proposed in    ref .",
    "@xcite to solve the @xmath1 problem , namely the    presence of a term like @xmath62 in    @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a  hidden \" field acquiring    a large vev .",

    "@xcite it was made the observation that in the framework of    any susy  gut theory , starting again with @xmath65 , an    effective @xmath1-term is generated by the integration of    the heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "assuming again a scenario with minimal    khler metric , so that the kinetic terms are canonical and the soft    breaking terms universal , the prediction for @xmath7 is once    more @xmath66 , as in eq .",

    "@xcite and the    corresponding soft breaking terms in refs .",
    "it was    noted , however , that the assumption of universality can still be quite    reasonable ( apart from phenomenologically desirable ) .",
    "it occurs e.g.    in the so  called dilaton  dominance limit @xcite . concerning    the @xmath1 problem and the value of @xmath7 , it was    noted in ref .",

    "yau manifolds and orbifold compactifications . in the    latter case",
    "the two higgses must belong to the untwisted sector or    possess similar modular weights .",
    "it is not clear by now what is the reason behind the coincidence in the prediction for @xmath7 in the previous three different supergravity scenarios .",
    "probably , it is a more general fact than just a characteristic of these scenarios . in any case",
    ", we will refer ( any of ) them as sugra ii .",
    "the corresponding mssm emerging from them is as in minimal supergravity except for the value of @xmath7 , which is given by ( [ abstr ] ) instead of ( [ abmin ] ) .",
    "the aim of our calculation is to obtain the restrictions on the mssm from the @xmath0 decay in the two supergravity scenarios , sugra i and sugra ii , above defined .",
    "the scheme of our procedure is the following .",
    "we start with the mssm with initial parameters [ inpar ] _ x , m_x , h_t , h_b , h_,,m , m , a , b by consideration of one of the two previous sugra theories we eliminate the @xmath7 parameter through eq .",
    "( [ abmin ] ) or eq .",

    "iv ) _ : :    correct electroweak breaking , i.e. @xmath68 .    conditions _ ( i)(iii ) _ allow to eliminate @xmath69 , while _ ( iv ) _ allows to eliminate one of the remaining parameters , which we choose to be @xmath1 .",
    "this finally leaves three independent parameters , namely [ inpar2 ] m , m , a .",
    "actually , for many choices of these parameters there is no value of @xmath1 capable of producing the correct electroweak breaking .",
    "therefore , this requirement restricts the parameter space substantially . on the other hand",
    ", there can be two branches of solutions depending on the sign of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we evaluate br(@xmath0 ) and compare it with the experimental measurements , eventually obtaining the restrictions on the initial parameters of theory coming from the @xmath0 decay .",
    "we will also express the restrictions in terms of some significative low  energy parameters , in particular @xmath70 .    in order to be consistent ,",
    "there is a number of refinements that have to be considered in the calculation . before explaining them ,",
    "let us stress that their importance is enhanced by the following fact .",
    "it is known that in order to get a correct electroweak breaking in the context of the mssm a certain amount of fine  tuning between the initial parameters is normally necessary @xcite .",
    "it is a matter of opinion what is the maximal acceptable amount of fine  tuning and how to measure it @xcite .",
    "but , in any case , this means that rather small variations on the initial parameters may have important implications at low energy .",
    "therefore , the determination of what are the initial parameters compatible with the experimental conditions _ ( i)(iv ) _ has to be made in a very careful way .    the first refinement concerns condition _",
    "( i)_. precision measurements at lep give a strong support @xcite to the expectation of supersymmetric unification of the gauge coupling constants at @xmath71 gev , @xmath72 .",
    "actually , the unification can only be achieved when the renormalization group equations ( rge ) of the gauge couplings are taken at two  loop order . for consistency , all the supersymmetric thresholds ( and the top quark one )",
    "have to be taken into account in the running in a separate way .",
    "this amounts to a technical problem since the values of the supersymmetric masses depend themselves on the initial parameters of the theory at @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , for a given model , i.e. for a choice of the initial parameters , one can not know a priori whether the resulting values of @xmath73 will be consistent with their experimental values , namely @xcite _ 1(m_z)&= & 0.016887 0.000040 + _ 2(m_z)&= & 0.03322 0.00025 [ alfexp ] + _ 3(m_z)&= & 0.124 0.006 this means that in order to include the perturbative unification in a consistent way an iterative process is necessary to adjust the initial parameters so that ( [ alfexp ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "a second refinement has to do with the masses of the fermions .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the top and bottom quarks and the tau lepton , @xmath74 , play an important role in the radiative electroweak breaking .",
    "their boundary conditions have to be chosen so that the experimental masses are fitted according to condition _ ( ii)_. however , the running masses defined as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 do not coincide with the physical ( pole ) masses @xmath78 . in particular , for the top quark @xcite [ mtphys ] m_t=\\{1 + + ( ) ^2 } m_t(m_t ) . where @xmath79 , @xmath80 represent the masses of the five lighter quarks , and similar expressions for the other quarks .",
    "in our calculation we have used the recent evidence for top quark production at cdf with a mass @xmath81 gev @xcite , taking the central value .",
    "notice , however , that the masses in the br(@xmath0 ) expressions , eqs .",
    "( [ amps ] ) , are the running masses at the electroweak scale .",
    "incidentally , it is amusing to realize that @xmath82 is extremely close to the pole mass @xmath83 ( while this does not happen for the other particles ) .    our third refinement , and the most important one , has to do with the electroweak breaking process .",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgses , @xmath84 , @xmath85 are to be obtained from the minimization of the higgs potential .",
    "the tree level part of this in the mssm has the form [ vo ] v_o = m_1 ^ 2 |h_1|^2 + m_2 ^ 2 |h_2|^2 + 2b h_1h_2 + ( g^2+g^2)(|h_2|^2-|h_1|^2)^2 , where all the parameters are understood to be running parameters evaluated at the renormalization scale @xmath86 . by a suitable redefinition of the phases of the fields it is always possible to impose @xmath87 . as was clarified by gamberini et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath88 and the corresponding tree level vevs @xmath89 are strongly @xmath86dependent . in order to get a",
    "much more scale independent potential the one  loop correction @xmath90 is needed .",
    "this is given by [ deltav1 ] v_1=_j m_j^4 , where @xmath91 are the tree - level ( field  dependent ) mass eigenstates and @xmath92 are spin factors . in this way , the minimization of @xmath93 gives one - loop vevs @xmath94 much more stable against variations of the @xmath86 scale .",
    "in general , there is a region of @xmath86 where @xmath94 are remarkably @xmath86stable and a particular scale , @xmath95 , always belonging to that region , at which @xmath96 essentially coincide with @xmath97 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 with a particular example .",
    "the fact that @xmath95 always belong to the stability region is not surprising since at @xmath95 the one  loop correction @xmath90 is necessarily small , which is the right criterion to choose an appropriate renormalization scale that minimizes the size of the potentially large logarithms , thus optimizing the perturbative expansion .",
    "@xmath95 is a certain average of the masses contributing to @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ deltav1 ] ) .",
    "when we move far from @xmath95 the logarithms become large and the perturbative expansion breaks down . as a result , @xmath94 become strongly @xmath86dependent and eventually meaningless .",
    "consequently , when @xmath95 is substantially larger than @xmath98 ( and this is the typical case ) , it is a bad approximation to minimize @xmath93 at @xmath99 as is very commonly done .",
    "this is again illustrated in fig .  1 . in our calculation",
    "we have evaluated @xmath100 at @xmath95 and then obtained @xmath94 at any scale by using the renormalization group running of the @xmath101 , @xmath102 wave functions .",
    "this is necessary in order to get the various masses appearing in the problem at the appropriate scale .",
    "furthermore , we have included in eq .",
    "( [ deltav1 ] ) _ all _ the supersymmetric spectrum since , as was stressed in @xcite , some common approximations , such as considering only the top and stop contributions , can lead to wrong results .",
    "the previous refinements imply a whole iterative process in order to determine a particular set of sensible initial parameter [ eq .  ( [ inpar ] ) ] .",
    "this is in fact the most painful task of the entire calculation .",
    "then , for each model it is quite straightforward to obtain the mass matrices of the supersymmetric particles and thus the mass eigenvalues , diagonalization matrices , etc , to be plugged in the expressions for the branching ratio , eqs .",

    "gev the restrictions are stronger for positive values of @xmath1 and small values of @xmath50 . for @xmath108 gev , however , the situation is different : whereas for @xmath2 the restrictions become very strong ( only a narrow range of @xmath70 is allowed ) , for @xmath3 there appear large windows of allowed values of @xmath70 . here",
    "the cleo lower bound plays a relevant role .",

    "we find a good agreement between our results and theirs .    * sugra ii *    we present the results for the sugra ii scenario in a way completely analogous to those of sugra i. in particular , figs .  6 , 7 , 8 correspond to figs .  2 , 3 , 4 respectively .",
    "we note here that the sign of @xmath1 is always negative since ( adopting the convention @xmath118 ) for @xmath3 and @xmath66 the necessary electroweak breaking can not be achieved .",
    "the sugra ii results present a similar pattern to those of sugra i with @xmath2 .",
    "again , we find that for a given value of @xmath50 there is a maximum acceptable value for @xmath70 , e.g. for @xmath113 gev , @xmath119 .",
    "the bound becomes less stringent as @xmath50 increases . as in the sugra",
    "i scenario , the sm limit is very smoothly achieved as @xmath50 grows , as can be seen from fig .",
    "therefore , once again , an improvement of the cleo bounds ( especially the upper one ) of order @xmath4 would amount to a dramatical improvement of the mssm constraints , pushing the limits on @xmath50 to the tev region and thus conflicting with fine - tuning and cosmological constraints .",
    "we have evaluated the branching ratio br(@xmath0 ) in the mssm that emerges from two attractive supergravity scenarios , sugra i and sugra ii defined in sect .  2 , determining the corresponding phenomenological restrictions on the independent parameters of the theory .",
    "for consistency , we have included in the calculation some one  loop refinements that have a substantial impact on the results .",
    "our numerical results show some disagreements with part of the previous results in the literature , while they are in agreement with others .",
    "for sugra i ( minimal supergravity ) we find that the cleo upper and lower bounds are capable to put efficient restrictions on @xmath120 ( the universal scalar and gaugino masses ) in both cases @xmath2 and @xmath3 , though the latter tends to be more restrictive .",
    "for the sugra ii scenario the results are similar , but here the relevant role is played by the cleo upper bound . since for both scenarios",
    "the trend to the sm limit as @xmath50 increases is very slow , an eventual improvement of the cleo upper and lower bounds of order @xmath4 would strengthen dramatically the previously found constraints",
    ". this would be enough to discard the sugra i with @xmath2 and sugra ii scenarios if no discrepancy is found with the sm prediction , while for sugra i with @xmath3 there will remain low - energy windows .",
