    "quantum simulation promises the ability to study the dynamics of highly complex quantum systems using more easily accessible and controllable systems  @xcite .",
    "digital quantum simulation schemes , using quantum computing resources , enable versatile simulations of a collection of systems - indeed , a universal set of quantum gates is sufficient to compose any desired unitary arising from a local hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , analogue quantum simulation schemes require precise engineering of a hamiltonian to reproduce the desired dynamics of the simulated system  @xcite , such that they are necessarily less versatile . moreover , digital simulators may allow for error correction due to their similarities with gate - based quantum computing schemes .",
    "many systems are considered as potential quantum simulators : cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , superconducting circuits  @xcite , and nuclear spin systems  @xcite , in addition to trapped ions @xcite .",
    "each simulator platform has its own advantages and challenges - cold atoms scale well but are difficult to control individually , whereas trapped ions and superconducting circuits face scaling difficulties but have experimentally - demonstrated individual control and readout techniques  @xcite .",
    "both trapped ions  @xcite and superconducting circuits  @xcite have demonstrated great potential for implementing digital quantum simulations , using to date up to nine qubits .",
    "here we demonstrate the scalability of a digital simulation scheme for trapped ions .",
    "fast gates were proposed as the scheme s entangling operation in  @xcite , and we assess this proposal to show that practical simulation fidelities of around 70% can be achieved using thousands of gates including heating and dephasing .",
    "a critical aspect of the scaling challenge for trapped ions in particular arises from the choice of entangling gate : implementations rely on high - fidelity mlmer - srensen ( ms ) gates  @xcite .",
    "these gates provide collective coupling between addressed ions , and can be applied in a specific operation sequence  @xcite , @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is an ms gate and @xmath4 is a local rotation on the @xmath5th ion in the trap .",
    "the ms gate couples every pair of ions in the trap evenly , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pauli @xmath8 operator on ion @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the total number of ions .",
    "although ms gates can be implemented with reasonable fidelity in ion traps  @xcite , they are much slower than the trap period due to their reliance on the lamb - dicke regime and the vibrational rotating - wave approximation . furthermore , as the number of addressed ions increases to scale up the simulation , the motional sideband spectral density increases and the gate time increases accordingly",
    ". it would thus be difficult to use ms gates , or alternative sideband - resolving gates , for a digital quantum simulation of a sufficient size to outperform current classical computers , with dozens of interacting spins or fermions .    in principle",
    ", each ms gate can be replaced by an ultrafast multiqubit ( umq ) gate in the simulation operation sequence , eq .",
    "( [ unitarydecomposition ] ) , as proposed in  @xcite : @xmath11 coupling only pairs involving the locally - rotated ion .",
    "these umq gates could be constructed using fast two - qubit phase gates  @xcite , which can be performed much faster than the trap period on ion crystals of arbitrary length , with high fidelity  @xcite . in light of recent progress towards the implementation of the first fast entangling gate using ultrafast laser pulses  @xcite",
    ", we explore this approach to validate the pursuit of fast gates as a scaling tool as well as to benchmark the required laser control and environmental coupling rates .    in this paper",
    ", we perform numerical simulations of fast gates in a full 40-qubit crystal to calculate the fidelity of a digital quantum simulation scheme under typical noise parameters .",
    "we find that near - future laser repetition rates will allow us to overcome the time barrier imposed by the ms gate and significantly reduce the operation time of digital quantum simulations , as well as greatly increasing the final fidelity .",
    "the latter implies that large - scale quantum simulations could be performed without error correction , bringing nearer the solutions for problems in condensed matter , quantum chemistry , and high - energy physics , which are infeasible to classical computers .",
    "fast two - qubit gates can be performed beyond the trap - period limit and implement the ideal unitary for a geometric phase gate , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the pauli @xmath14 operator on the @xmath9th ion .",
    "these gates are implemented using counter - propagating laser @xmath0-pulse pairs , which act as state - dependent momentum kicks on the motional modes while preserving the internal states of the ions .",
    "this behaviour is described in the optical rotating - wave approximation by the kick unitary @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the position operator on ion @xmath17 , @xmath14 is the number of @xmath0-pulse pairs used for the momentum kick and @xmath9 is the laser wavenumber .",
    "these kicks are nearly instantaneous compared to the trap period , so the evolution of a real gate operation can be expressed as the product of the kick unitaries interspersed with free motional evolution , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath17th kick unitary , @xmath20 is the time between kicks @xmath17 and @xmath21 ( 0 if @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 is the total number of kicks .",
    "an analytic solution for this evolution to implement the ideal unitary in eq .",
    "( [ ideal ] ) can not generally be found , so numerical methods are used to optimise the fidelity of the resulting gate .",
    "the high - fidelity solutions found by this optimisation approach will restore the initial motional state of the trap , while the state - dependent phase - space trajectories for the motional modes will enclose areas corresponding to the @xmath24 phase required by the ideal unitary .",
    "this results in a geometric phase gate that produces minimal trap heating .",
    "the structure of the kicks is chosen to be antisymmetric , which approximately restores the motional state - the dominant motional error term is cubic with respect to gate time @xcite .",
    "this reduces the difficulty of the numerical optimisation and produces generally higher - fidelity solutions . in particular , the fast robust antisymmetric gate ( frag ) scheme  @xcite was found to give the shortest gate times for a target fidelity using realistic experimental parameters .",
    "this scheme uses the kick sequence @xmath25 where @xmath14 is the set of kick magnitudes associated with the times @xmath26 and @xmath27 is an integer .",
    "negative and positive kick amplitudes represent kicks in opposite directions .",
    "the originally proposed frag scheme restricts the order of the kicks , so @xmath28 . removing this restriction preserves the antisymmetric structure of the sequence whilst allowing numerical optimisations to search a larger parameter space .",
    "this often results in higher - fidelity gate solutions , so we ignore the kick ordering restriction in this work .",
    "we address the axial phonon modes of the trap - it is possible to perform quantum gates using transverse phonon modes @xcite , but for a typical linear trap the electrode geometry will limit their speed due to micromotion . addressing the axial modes",
    "requires that ground - state population in the ions not addressed by each fast gate be ` shelved ' @xcite into a third state such that they are not affected by the fast gate pulses . in the following analysis",
    "we neglect the infidelity of the shelving technique , as each ion can be shelved with a single optical @xmath0 pulse ( albeit at a different wavelength ) and thus errors will contribute negligibly compared with the infidelity of the fast gates , which use hundreds of @xmath0 pulses .",
    "we can use fast geometric phase gates to implement the umq gates required in digital quantum simulations .",
    "if we label the ions in a paul trap from 1 to @xmath10 starting at one end , this is done by performing a fast gate on ions 1 and 2 , a swap gate on these ions , then a fast gate on ions 2 and 3 and so on until we reach ions @xmath29 and @xmath10 .",
    "this gives the umq unitary required up to local rotations , not preserving the position of the internal states in the trap .",
    "the reversed umq gate in the simulation step restores the position of the internal states .",
    "it should be noted that this method of constructing a umq gate requires fast swap gates , which can be implemented with three cnot gates @xcite .",
    "each cnot requires one fast geometric phase gate and some local rotations .",
    "this allows us to implement a non - position - preserving umq gate using @xmath30 swap gates and an additional @xmath29 fast gates , for a total of @xmath31 fast gates . due to the relative timescales and fidelities of local rotations , which require only single laser pulses that take negligible time and",
    "can be performed with very high fidelity  @xcite , we consider only infidelity and time cost of the fast two - qubit gates in our results .",
    "we estimated fidelity @xmath32 for a umq gate by first calculating the fidelities of the component two - qubit gates , as shown in the methods .",
    "we optimised the component gate fidelities for every adjacent pair of ions in paul traps of various sizes .",
    "the longitudinal trap frequency was chosen as @xmath33 , where the power of @xmath10 represents a no - buckling limit for the trap derived from molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and the constant coefficient is chosen to give a typical trapping frequency of 1.2 mhz for a two - ion trap .",
    "the transverse trap frequency was constant at @xmath34 mhz .",
    "the lamb - dicke parameter was @xmath35 for the two - ion trap , and scaled appropriately with trapping frequency for larger traps  @xcite",
    ".     represents the number of @xmath0-pulse pairs used for each momentum kick in the fast gates .",
    "the initial motional state is a thermal state with average occupation @xmath36 for each mode.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the results of this optimisation are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "an estimate of total fidelity for the umq gate on the trap is obtained by multiplying the fidelities of all the constituent fast gates .",
    "this should give a lower bound on the true umq fidelity , as this method assumes gate errors are perfectly correlated .",
    "we see that the fidelity achieved by the numerical optimisation decays with the size of the trap , which is expected because more motional modes must be restored to their initial state while contributing to an ideal phase for the gate .",
    "however , we do see very high fidelity overall , even for larger traps .",
    "the @xmath37 fast gate , corresponding to a minimum laser repetition rate of around 10  ghz , achieves a umq gate fidelity of 99.998% in a 40-ion trap .",
    "this would correspond to fidelity of around 95% , without including error correction , for 10 trotter steps of a 20-site fermionic lattice simulation , requiring 2680 umq gates .",
    "current repetition rates for comparable systems are up to 300  mhz @xcite .",
    "the ms gate fidelity is comparable with the umq gate constructed using fast gates with @xmath38 .",
    "errors in the ms gate , such as from off - resonant excitations , scale linearly with the number of ions  @xcite .",
    "ms gate fidelities of 99.3% have been achieved @xcite , and we consider a conservative two - qubit gate infidelity of @xmath39 in the figure for comparison with the umq gates .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1]b ) , we analyze the dependence on time of our fast gates scheme . again focusing on the @xmath37 case , the time required for a 40-ion umq gate",
    "is 17.9 , comparable with the trap period of 10 for this trap .",
    "furthermore , the trap period does not place any fundamental limit on the speed of fast gates as it does with ms gates . in general ,",
    "an ms gate for n ions will take a time @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the time it takes for 1 ion .",
    "this can be seen from the expression of the gate s phase in terms of experimental parameters , @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the rabi frequency , which does not depend on the number of ions and is limited by the laser power , @xmath44 is the lamb - dicke parameter , which for @xmath23 ions is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the single - ion lamb - dicke parameter , when the com vibrational mode is considered",
    ". the detuning @xmath47 sets the gate time to @xmath48 . to compensate for the @xmath49 decay rate of @xmath50 with the number of ions , the detuning has to be decreased accordingly , @xmath51 , which increases the time of the ms gate as @xmath52 .",
    "a two - qubit ms gate is typically around 50 long  @xcite , thus a 40-ion gate takes an order of magnitude more time than our umq gate implementation with @xmath37 , as shown in the figure .",
    "higher available repetition rates would lead to even more significant gains , as seen in the @xmath53 case .",
    "although the ms gate scales with @xmath54 and the scaling of the umq gates is close to linear in @xmath23 , the gate times are only equal for ion numbers on the order of 1000 .",
    "this is far beyond the expected capacity of linear traps , and for this number of ions more creative ion arrays will be required  @xcite , most likely composed of linear traps where the umq gates prove to be the most practical .",
    "there is a clear trend towards higher fidelity and lower gate time with higher momentum in the results shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1]b ) , which means the development of faster pulsed lasers would lead to an even more favourable comparison with the ms gate .",
    "we have shown that under ideal conditions , a very high - fidelity umq gate can be performed using fast gates .",
    "however , to consider the experimental feasibility of performing simulations of interacting spins and fermions using fast gates , we analyse the effects of potential sources of error on the gates . in particular , errors in @xmath0 pulse area have been shown to affect gate fidelity significantly @xcite .",
    "we also consider dynamical effects of decoherence during the gate evolution .    to explore the effect of an error in @xmath0 pulse area on a gate applied to an adjacent pair of ions in a large trap , we employed a method relying on the assumption that the motional mode dynamics are separable during the gate , a valid assumption for small @xmath0 pulse errors in harmonic trapping potentials .",
    "this enables computationally feasible simulation of the gate evolution , allowing simple calculation of a representative - state fidelity for various levels of @xmath0 pulse error @xcite .",
    "the initial motional state is chosen as the first excited number state for each motional mode , allowing simulations with state vectors .",
    "the representative - state fidelity is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the state @xmath57 , chosen to give an even superposition of the two - qubit computational basis states - the gate s action is identical if the qubits are flipped , even with imperfect pulses , so @xmath58 and @xmath59 are not necessary in the superposition .     fast gate and ( b ) a full umq gate against the rotational infidelity in each @xmath0 pulse , @xmath60 . the error in ( b )",
    "is estimated assuming the errors in successive fast gates are uncorrelated.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    we simulated two - qubit fast gates on the outermost adjacent pair of ions ( ions 1 and 2 ) in traps of varying size .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:2]a ) .",
    "simulations used square pulses with a rabi frequency given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the pulse time such that @xmath63 gives a perfect @xmath0 pulse .",
    "results are plotted against rotational infidelity @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the real and ideal unitaries for the @xmath0 pulse . for this square pulse",
    "this rotational infidelity is approximately @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "pulses within each pulse pair are assumed to have a relative phase of @xmath0 - this means there is no residual population transfer between the @xmath68 and @xmath69 states , even with imperfect pulse area , helping to reduce gate error from pulse imperfections @xcite .",
    "such a phase shift would be easily possible in an experiment using simple optics .",
    "we also simulated a full umq gate on a three - ion trap with low - momentum fast gates and imperfect @xmath0 pulses .",
    "comparing the infidelity of the entire umq operation to that of a single fast gate with the same @xmath0 pulse imperfection , it was determined that errors due to @xmath0 pulse imperfections in successive fast gates are uncorrelated , and thus this type of error scales with the number of gates applied as @xmath54 .",
    "this allowed estimation of the error for a complete umq gate with imperfect @xmath0 pulses , shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:2]b ) . given this estimation , for rotational infidelity over @xmath1 ,",
    "the gate infidelity is too high to implement a 40-ion simulation with an estimated fidelity above 70% .",
    "thus , we can place this limit on @xmath0 pulse errors for fast gates to be useful for a quantum simulation outperforming current classical computers without error correction .",
    "proposals exist for composite pulse schemes which can produce extremely high fidelities , robust to the type of intensity instability or miscalibration that would damage a square pulse @xcite .",
    "the current state of the art for single - qubit operation error is approximately 10@xmath70 @xcite , which compares favourably with the limit for pulse errors in this work .",
    "we expect single - qubit operation error to correlate with achievable pulse errors quite well as these operations are often performed with single or small numbers of laser pulses .",
    "we also considered the effect of decoherence during fast gate evolution , in order to place a limit on the rate of decoherence processes to maintain the high fidelity of fast gates . in this case , a full simulation is not feasible for a 40-ion trap , so our results are inferred from simulations of decoherence effects on a low - momentum ( @xmath71 ) fast gate on a two - ion trap .",
    "the full evolution of this gate was simulated , assuming the momentum kicks to be approximately instantaneous and thus unitary , and solving a master equation using a monte carlo trajectory approach during the free evolution periods of the gate .",
    "we simulated the effects of trap heating and dephasing separately .",
    "the state of the trap evolves in the absence of laser light according to the master equations @xmath72",

    "we have assumed an infinite temperature reservoir for trap heating , a valid model for a randomly fluctuating electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "fidelity is again calculated using a representative state starting in the motional ground state .",
    "we trace out the motional state to calculate the computational fidelity after decoherence has been included in the simulations .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . the infidelity calculated under trap heating shows that heating during gate evolution has a dynamical effect on the gate , damaging the phase accumulation required to implement the ideal unitary .",
    "the fidelities shown here are lower than that of a gate acting on a hotter initial state , meaning that the decoherence must be affecting the evolution of the gate .",
    "this can be understood physically as the heating changing the motional phase space trajectory of the gate .",
    "the effect of dephasing is similar to that of trap heating . the physical reasoning behind dephasing affecting the gate is more obvious , as dephasing directly introduces classical uncertainty in the phase of the ions internal state , necessarily resulting in a loss of gate fidelity .",
    "two - qubit fast gate in a two - ion trap under",
    "( a ) trap heating and ( b ) dephasing.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    we can extend the conclusions drawn from these results to larger traps . if phonon absorption significantly damages the gate , we must work in a regime where a phonon absorption is quite unlikely during any operation .",
    "considering that our 40-ion simulation would take around 50 ms and this example fast gate takes 1.4 , this limits both dephasing and heating rates to below 10 s@xmath79 for a high - fidelity simulation , which is comparable to current ion traps  @xcite .    finally , we considered the effect of the anharmonicity of the coulomb interaction on the fidelity of fast gates .",
    "typically , the coulomb interaction is truncated at second order when treating the motion of ions in a linear trap , in order to allow representation of the ions motional states in terms of harmonic normal modes .",
    "this greatly simplifies calculations and was critical in enabling computationally efficient numerical searches for high - fidelity fast gates , but it is possible that this approximation neglects significant contributions from higher - order terms in the interaction .",
    "this is especially true because fast gates couple much more strongly to the motion than other gate techniques , enabling their higher speed .    to confirm the usefulness of gate schemes found using the harmonic approximation",
    ", we performed a full simulation of the dynamics of a two - ion trap during an @xmath37 fast gate using xmds @xcite , including the full coulomb interaction .",
    "trap specifications were the same as those used in the rest of this work .",
    "fidelity computed from this simulation was identical to the fidelity of the same gate when truncating the interaction to second order , up to numerical precision of the simulation ( approximately @xmath80 ) .",
    "this confirms that anharmonicity of the interaction has no appreciable effect on fast gates in the momentum ranges suggested in this work .",
    "fast gates have been proposed as a superior two - body gate for trapped ion quantum information processing , being much faster than existing gates and robust to many sources of error . in this work",
    ", we have analysed the potential for fast gates to implement useful digital quantum simulations , enough to outperform a classical computer .",
    "we have also studied the limits on experimental setups to successfully implement high - fidelity operations using fast gates .",
    "high - performing gates require rotational fidelities on the order of 10@xmath81 and decoherence rates below 10 s@xmath79 .",
    "if these requirements are satisfied , it appears that fast gates can significantly outperform ms gates in terms of gate time , and can be implemented with very high fidelity if high - repetition - rate lasers are available  @xcite .",
    "therefore , fast gates hold significant promise for the future of trapped ion quantum simulation and quantum information processing .",
    "this calculation was performed with a state - averaged fidelity measure , assuming an initial thermal product state for the motional modes of the trap .",
    "this fidelity measure is given by @xmath82}\\ \\!\\ !",

    "the assumption of a thermal product state simplifies expectation values of motional displacement operators that appear upon expanding this expression , allowing the calculation of an analytic expression for the state - averaged fidelity given a set of kick times .",
    "this expression simplifies numerical optimisation by removing the need to calculate the full unitary @xmath85 .",

    "<S> large - scale digital quantum simulations require thousands of fundamental entangling gates to construct the simulated dynamics . despite success in a variety of small - scale simulations , </S>",
    "<S> quantum information processing platforms have hitherto failed to demonstrate the combination of precise control and scalability required to systematically outmatch classical simulators . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that trapped - ion processors , which excel at controlling small numbers of qubits , can also achieve the requisite scalability to outperform classical computers without error correction . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the performance of such a large - scale digital simulator , and find that fidelity of around 70% is realizable for @xmath0-pulse infidelities below @xmath1 in traps subject to realistic rates of heating and dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> this scalability relies on fast gates : entangling gates faster than the trap period that are yet to be performed . </S>",
    "<S> our results motivate the pursuit of fast gates as a critical scaling tool for trapped - ion computing architectures . </S>"
