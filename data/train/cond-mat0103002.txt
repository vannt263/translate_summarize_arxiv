    "it is demonstrated that the critical temperature @xmath59 decreases from @xmath60 to 0.802 @xmath61 when the random field width increases from 0 to 0.3 @xmath58 .",
    "the figure 3(b ) shows the calculated results of the soft - mode frequency when @xmath62 and @xmath47 .",
    "we observe an extraordinary difference between the results calculated by the two methods : the frequency in the conventional method keeps nonzero while the frequency in the modified method decreases to zero at the critical temperature . from the curve of the polarization in fig .",
    "3(a ) we know that the phase transition is of the second - order type and the symmetry of the system changes at the critical temperature .",
    "a zero frequency at the critical temperature is required by the soft mode theory .",

    "4(a ) clearly demonstrates the jump of the polarization and the difference of the phase transition temperature between the cooling and heating processes , which indicates that the phase transition is of the first - order type . in a cooling process",
    ", the soft mode frequency decreases to zero at the phase transition temperature ( over - cooled temperature ) and suddenly jumps to the nonzero frequency value of the ferroelectric phase . in a heating process ,",
    "the cases are similar except that the phase transition occurs at a higher temperature ( overheated temperature ) .    for",
    "the relaxor ferroelectrics such as pmn , an external field with proper strength will induce a first - order phase transition.@xcite the second - order phase transition occurs in stronger field ranges , and the phase transition vanishes when the field increases further .",
    "the curves of the soft - mode frequency at different external fields are depicted in fig .",
    "5 when @xmath47 .",
    "at the external fields @xmath64 and 0.095 @xmath58 , the phase transition is of the first - order type ( see ref .",
    "there is a jump of frequency at the phase - transition temperature , and a down - pulse reaching the zero value exists above the phase transition temperature .",
    "when an external field is applied , the symmetry of the system has already been lowered at high temperatures , and the high and low temperature phases can not be distinguished from the symmetry changing .",
    "however , the zero soft - mode frequency at the critical temperature clearly indicates the existence of the phase transition . for @xmath65 ,",
    "the phase transition is of the second - order type , and a down - peak of the frequency is easy to be identified .",
    "it is not a `` real '' phase transition in the sense that the soft - mode frequency does not decrease to zero .",
    "the phase transition can only be approximately defined from the rapid change of the polarization or from the minimum of the soft - mode frequency . for a strong field @xmath66 ,",
    "the soft - mode frequency varies rather smoothly , and the softness of frequency is indefinite . in this case",
    ", it is difficult to identify any phase transition ; in other words , the transition does not exist .    rather different from the common sense , the random fields with proper distribution width will promote the spontaneous phase transition in the eight - direction ferroelectric system.@xcite in fig . 6 , the soft - mode frequencies of the paraelectric phase at different temperatures when",
    "@xmath47 are given as functions of the width of random fields .",
    "with increasing width of the random fields , the frequency decreases first , and then increases .",
    "the minimal frequency is reached at a nonzero width .",
    "the promotion effect of random fields on the phase transition is demonstrated most clearly in the case of @xmath67 : the random fields with distribution width @xmath68 induce the spontaneous appearance of the ferroelectric phase .",
    "the original motivation of the eight - direction order - disorder ferroelectric model is to predict the phase transition in relaxors , but not to explore the dielectric mechanism.@xcite it is known that relaxors have a rather broad and smooth spectrum of the relaxation times , and the relaxation time shows a progressive slowing down upon cooling , which results in a transition into a glassy state.@xcite a distribution of relaxation time instead of a single frequency of the soft mode should be introduced for fully describing the dielectric properties of relaxors such as the frequency dispersion . the monte carlo simulation on the two - direction pseudospin model has been done to explain the dielectric behaviors of relaxors.@xcite thus further works of simulation on the eight - direction model may be helpful for understanding the characteristics of relaxors .",
    "in summary , the soft modes in the two - direction and eight - direction order - disorder ferroelectric systems are syudied in this article .",
    "we indicate that the conventional method yields incorrect soft - mode frequency of the pseudospin model , and present the valid modified equation .",
    "the soft - mode frequency of the ferroelectric phase calculated by the modified method is smaller than the conventional values , while the critical temperature does not vary .",
    "when there exists random electric fields , the frequency calculated by the conventional method does not decrease to zero at the critical temperature , which is physically unreasonable .",
    "in contrast , the modified method yields the reasonable results .",
    "in the eight - direction ferroelectrics , the soft mode of paraelectric phase decreases to zero at the over - cooled temperature .",
    "the calculation of the soft modes under external electric fields shows that the frequency decreases to zero at the first - order phase transition temperature although the symmetry of the system has been destroyed at high temperatures .",
    "we find that the soft - mode frequency decreases first and then increases with increasing distribution width of the random fields , which testifies the promotion effect of random fields on the spontaneous appearance of the ferroelectric phase .",
