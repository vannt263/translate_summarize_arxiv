    "gd 244 ( v394 peg , wd 2254 + 126 , @xmath2 ) was discovered to be a luminosity - variable da white dwarf by @xcite . based on their 3-hour - long photometric observation with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) ,",
    "@xcite determined four independent pulsation frequencies between @xmath3s and a few combination terms . according to its atmospheric parameters ( @xmath4k , @xmath5 ) , gd 244 is situated in the middle of the empirical dav instability strip .",
    "photometric data were collected again on gd 244 , between 2003 and 2006 ( 41 nights ) , with the 2.1-m otto struve telescope at mcdonald observatory @xcite .",
    "the star was one of the targets of a survey , in which isolated and stable - amplitude modes were utilized to search for possible low - mass companions of pulsating white dwarf stars applying the @xmath6 technique .",
    "the survey did not reveal any sign of a stellar- or planetary - mass companion of gd 244 .",
    "we collected data on gd 244 on 19 nights in 2006 and 2007 with the 1-m ritchey - chrtien - coud telescope at piszkstet mountain station of konkoly observatory .",
    "fergal mullally kindly provided the survey measurements on gd 244 for our analysis .",
    "these data and our additional measurements at konkoly observatory allow the detailed investigation of the long - term pulsational behaviour of gd 244 .",
    "we present our first findings here .",
    "table  [ tabl : periods ] lists all the independent pulsation frequencies and the corresponding periods and amplitudes of gd 244 published so far .",
    "previous light - variation studies revealed seven pulsation frequencies , two doublets and three single periods .",
    "one of them ( at 203s ) proved to be considerably stable , and this was utilized to search for a possible planetary - mass companion in the survey of @xcite .",
    "not all the periods were detected in both data sets : e.g. the 294.6s mode found by @xcite was not reported in the 2003 mcdonald data @xcite .",
    "there is a well - known general trend observed in the dav stars that towards the red edge of the instability strip the light variations are more complex , non - sinusoidal , with longer periods and higher amplitudes .",
    "short - term amplitude variations are also more common among the cooler zz ceti stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which may be responsible for the different set of periods observed in different epochs .",

    "we checked the amplitudes and frequencies on daily , monthly and yearly time bases .",
    "we used period04 @xcite , and for comparison , custom developed software tools , including the light curve fitting program lcfit @xcite .",
    "lcfit has linear ( amplitudes and phases ) and nonlinear ( amplitudes , phases and frequencies ) least - squares fitting options , and can handle base frequencies and linear combination terms as input .",
    "periods around 203 , 256 and 307s can be detected practically in all daily data sets .",
    "the daily data suggested long - term periodic variation in the case of the 307s peak ( see panel a of fig .",
    "[ fig : amplvar ] ) , with @xmath0 day period . from one year to the next , the increase or decrease in the average of the daily amplitudes found to be 2 - 6 times larger than the corresponding standard deviations .",
    "however , we know that there are actually at least two peaks at 307s , which can not be resolved by the daily measurements , as their separation is @xmath16d@xmath17 . thus , we checked the amplitudes of the doublet components separately on longer time bases .",
    "we found that the 307.1s period component of the 307s doublet show clear long - term amplitude modulation . neither the other component of this doublet ( at 306.6s ) nor any of the other known doublet s components ( at 256s , see panel b of fig .",
    "[ fig : amplvar ] ) show similar variations .",
    "the 203s mode also remains stable both in amplitude ( panel c of fig .",
    "[ fig : amplvar ] ) and in frequency . the frequencies of the doublet at 307s do not seem to vary ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : freqs ] ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the observed amplitude modulation is that two modes of fairly close frequencies are excited at @xmath18s .",
    "we analysed together all the 20032006 mcdonald observatory data for this purpose . for this preliminary analysis",
    ", we did not include the konkoly data , to eliminate the possible instrumental effects caused by the different detectors and filters used for the observations .",
    "the analysis revealed that we can detect indeed two significant peaks in this region of the fourier spectrum of the combined yearly data , with the frequency separation of @xmath19d@xmath17 ( 0.016@xmath8hz ) .",
    "this is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the separation of the known @xmath13@xmath14 doublet components .",
    "if these two peaks represent independent pulsation frequencies , they can not be resolved by one - season - long observations , which can cause the observed apparent amplitude variation of the @xmath20s peak showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplvar ] .",
    "this explanation also implies that both of these close - frequency modes have stable frequencies and amplitudes .",
    "panel a of fig .",
    "[ fig : amplvar ] shows a sine wave fit to the daily amplitude solutions with the frequency fixed to the @xmath21d@xmath17 ( @xmath22d ) value .",
    "frequency and amplitude modulation in a similar time scale were reported in the case of the dbv - type _ kepler _ target kic 08626021 @xcite , which were explained as the results of nonlinear resonant coupling operating among rotational triplet components .",
    "our case seems to be different : only one frequency component of the doublets shows clear sign of amplitude modulation , and we can not find evidence of frequency modulation either .",
    "however , this can not rule out that this same physical reason is responsible for the observed variation , as nonlinear resonant coupling can cause the amplitude modulation of only one frequency component . in this case , the closely spaced peak with @xmath23 separation is only a mathematical representation of the amplitude modulation in the fourier spectrum .",
