    "attempts to study qcd thermodynamics on the lattice go back to the early 80 s when lattice calculations in @xmath0 gauge theory provided the first rigorous theoretical evidence for deconfinement @xcite . the problem of calculating thermodynamic observables in pure gluonic theory was solved in 1996 @xcite , while simulations involving dynamical quarks were limited to large quark masses and had no control over the discretization errors @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations of qcd thermodynamics with light dynamical quarks remained challenging until recently . during the past six years calculations with light @xmath1 quarks",
    "have been performed using improved staggered fermion actions @xcite .",
    "there was also progress in lattice qcd calculations at non - zero temperature using domain wall and wilson fermion formulations @xcite .",
    "however , due to much larger computational costs the corresponding results are far less extensive .    to get reliable predictions from lattice qcd the lattice spacing @xmath2 should be sufficiently small relative to the typical qcd scale , i.e. @xmath3 . for staggered fermions , discretization errors go like @xmath4 but discretization errors due to flavor symmetry breaking turn out to be numerically quite large and dominate the cutoff dependence of thermodynamic quantities at low temperatures . to reduce these errors one has to use improved staggered fermion actions with so - called fat links @xcite .",
    "at high temperature the dominant discretization errors go like @xmath5 and therefore could be very large .",
    "thus it is mandatory to use improved discretization schemes , which improve the quark dispersion relation and eliminate these discretization errors .",
    "lattice fermion actions used in numerical calculations typically implement some version of fat links as well as improvement of quark dispersion relation and are referred to as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in this contribution",
    "i am going to discuss lattice qcd calculations on the equation of state , study of deconfinement aspects of the qcd transition , including color screening and fluctuations of conserved charges , determination of the chiral transition temperature , as well as calculations of temporal and spatial meson correlation functions .",
    "the equation of state has been calculated using different improved staggered fermion actions @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 . in the lattice calculations of the equation of state and many other quantities",
    "the temperature is varied by varying the lattice spacing at fixed value of the temporal extent @xmath10 .",
    "the temperature @xmath11 is given by the lattice spacing and the temporal extent , @xmath12 . therefore taking the continuum limit corresponds to @xmath13 at the fixed physical volume .",
    "the calculation of thermodynamic observables proceeds through the calculation of the trace of the energy momentum tensor , @xmath14 , also known as trace anomaly or interaction measure .",
    "this is due to the fact that this quantity can be expressed in terms of expectation values of local gluonic and fermionic operators , ( see e.g. ref .",
    "different thermodynamic observables can be obtained from the interaction measure through integration of the trace anomaly .",
    "the pressure can be written as @xmath15 the lower integration limit @xmath16 is chosen such that the pressure is exponentially small there .",

    "it was found that the pressure and the energy density are below the ideal gas value by about @xmath43 at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "possible reason for this larger deviation could be the fact that the quark masses used in this calculation were fixed in units of temperature instead being tuned to give constant meson masses as lattice spacing is decreased . as discussed in ref .",

    "the differences between the @xmath9 action and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 actions for the trace anomaly translates into the differences in the pressure and the energy density . in particular",

    "the expansion coefficients in quark chemical potential @xmath48 and the hadronic ones @xmath49 are related to each other @xcite . while taylor expansion can be used to study the physics at non - zero baryon density they are interesting on their own right as they are related to the fluctuations of conserved charges .",
    "the later are sensitive probes of deconfinement .",
    "this is because fluctuation of conserved charges are sensitive to the underlying degrees of freedom which could be hadronic or partonic .",

    "similar picture can seen in other fluctuations , in particular for light quark number fluctuation , @xmath51 , which is also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : chis ] .",
    "the more rapid rise of @xmath51 in the transition region is presumably a quark mass effect .",

    "it sharply drops from the hadron resonance gas value to the value corresponding to an ideal gas of quarks .",
    "since the fluctuations of conserved charges are so well described by ideal quark gas it is interesting to compare the lattice results for quark number fluctuations with resummed perturbation theory .",

    "one of the most prominent feature of the quark gluon plasma is the presence of chromoelectric ( debye ) screening . the easiest way to study chromoelectric",

    "let me finally note that contrary to the electro magnetic plasma the static chormomagnetic fields are screened in qgp .",

    "recent calculations with @xmath6 action support this pictures @xcite .",
    "this also means that for non - zero light quark masses the transition must be a crossover .",
    "the later fact seems to be supported by calculations in ref .",
    "the @xmath74 symmetry is explicitly broken in the vacuum by the anomaly but it is expected to be effectively restored at high temperatures as non - perturbative vacuum fluctuations responsible for its breaking are suppressed at high temperatures . if the @xmath74 symmetry is restored at the same temperature as the @xmath70 symmetry the transition could be first order @xcite .",
    "recent calculations with staggered as well as with domain wall fermions suggest that @xmath74 symmetry gets restored at temperature that is significantly higher than the chiral transition temperature @xcite .    for massless quark",
    "the chiral condensate vanishes at the critical temperature @xmath75 and is the order parameter .",
    "therefore in the lattice studies one calculates the chiral condensate and its derivative with respect to the quark mass called the chiral susceptibility .",
    "for the staggered fermion formulation most commonly used in the lattice calculations these quantities can be written as follows : @xmath76 where the subscript @xmath77 and @xmath78 will denote the expectation value at finite and zero temperature , respectively .",

    "this is related to the spectral function via integral relation @xmath158 given the data on the euclidean meson correlator @xmath159 the meson spectral function can be calculated using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite . for charmonium",
    "this was done by using correlators calculated on isotropic lattices @xcite as well as anisotropic lattices @xcite in the quenched approximation .",
    "it has been found that quarkonium correlation function in euclidean time show only very small temperature dependence @xcite . in other channels , namely the vector , scalar and axial - vector channels stronger temperature dependence",
    "was found @xcite .",
    "the spectral functions in the pseudo - scalar and vector channels reconstructed from mem show peak structures which may be interpreted as a ground state peak @xcite .",
    "together with the weak temperature dependence of the correlation functions this was taken as strong indication that the 1s charmonia ( @xmath160 and @xmath161 ) survive in the deconfined phase to temperatures as high as @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the systematic effects show , however , that the reconstruction of the charmonium spectral function is not reliable at high temperatures @xcite , in particular the presence of peaks corresponding to bound states can not be reliably established .",

    "the only statement that can be made is that the spectral function does not show significant changes within the errors of the calculations .",

    "this is due to the fact that even in absence of bound states quarkonium spectral functions show significant enhancement in the threshold region @xcite .",

    "similar , though smaller in magnitude , enhancement of quarkonium correlators due to zero mode is seen also in the vector channel @xcite .",
    "here it is related to heavy quark transport @xcite . due to the heavy quark mass",
    "the euclidean correlators for heavy quarkonium can be decomposed into a high and low energy part @xmath165 the area under the peak in the spectral functions at zero energy @xmath166 giving the zero mode contribution to the euclidean correlator is proportional to some susceptibility , @xmath167 , which have been calculated on the lattice in ref .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the generalized susceptibilities can be described by a quasi - particle model .",
    "the generalized susceptibilities have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the free theory . replacing the bare quark mass entering in the expression of the generalized susceptibilities by an effective temperature dependent masses one can describe the zero mode contribution very well in all channels @xcite .    while temporal correlators are not sensitive to the change in the spectral functions spatial quarkonium correlation functions could be more sensitive to this .",
    "recent lattice calculations show indication for significant change in spatial charmonium correlators above deconfinement@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the meson spectral functions was also performed in the light quark sector @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly this analysis revealed peak structures in the deconfined phase which are difficult to interpret .",
    "most likely the peak structures are artifacts of the mem analysis .",
    "the new analysis of the vector spectral function performed on fine lattices and using several lattice spacings did not show any evidence for such structures @xcite .",
