    "both the standard model of particle physics and einstein s general relativity are locally lorentz and @xmath1 invariant .",
    "probing their violations is an important way to search for new physics and in recent years has attracted a lot of interests .",
    "usually , studies are focused on the phenomenologies in matter and gravity sectors separately .",
    "however there is an issue related to the consistency of the theory which needs to be examined . in a class of models of lorentz symmetry breaking , fixed preferred frames",
    "are introduced @xcite .",
    "the violation effects are formulated by introducing operators like @xmath3 in the lagrangian of the matter with @xmath2 being a fixed vector and @xmath4 the matter current .",
    "the existence of the fixed preferred frames violates general coordinate covariance also .",
    "if the lorentz invariance in the matter sector is broken in this way , it is impossible to get an energy - momentum tensor of the matter which is both symmetric and covariantly conserved .",

    "we provide a solution to this problem by modifying the gravity simultaneously in a non - covariant way , so that the new terms in the gravity sector balance the lorentz violating effects in the matter sector .    as a concrete example , in this paper we consider a matter sector where the electrodynamics is modified by a chern - simons term @xmath0 .",
    "this term breaks lorentz and @xmath1 symmetries if @xmath2 is treated as an external field and the related phenomenology has been studied extensively in the literature , such as testing @xmath1 of photons in astrophysics @xcite and cosmology @xcite .",
    "a salient feature of this modified electrodynamics is the rotations of the polarizations of propagating photons .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath9 depends on the external field . due to this feature",
    ", a part of @xmath10 type polarization will be rotated to @xmath11 type polarization for photons .",
    "this will generate @xmath12 and @xmath13 correlations in the power spectra of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",

    "@xcite , two of us with feng and li did the simulations on the measurement of @xmath14 with the cmbpol and planck experiments .",
    "we pointed out that in such experiments the @xmath13 spectrum will be the most sensitive probe of such lorentz and @xmath1 violation . in @xcite , two of us with feng , xia , and chen first found that a nonzero rotation angle @xmath15 deg is mildly favored by the cmb polarization data from the three - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap3 ) observations @xcite and the january 2003 antarctic flight of boomerang @xcite . with the newly released five year data @xcite , the wmap group gives @xmath16 deg , which when combined with the boomerang data is @xcite @xmath17 deg .",

    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we firstly review briefly the maxwell - chern - simons theory and point out the inconsistence when including the gravity . we then introduce a gravitational chern - simons term and demonstrate how the theory becomes consistent ; in section iii , we study the effects of our model on cmb polarizations ; in section iv , we analyze the late - time evolution of relic gravitational waves and our result show the potential signals at high - frequency regime ; section v is the summary .",

    "therefore , this suppression depends on the energy scale of the effective mass term .",
    "although for both non - commutativity and chern - simons modifications , the lorentz violations take place at high - energy scales , the effective mass caused by non - commutativity appears at low - frequency regime but that brought by chern - simons term happens at high - frequency regime .",
    "in this paper , we pointed out that the lorentz violations induced by fixed preferred frames in the matter sector will make the gravitational field equation inconsistent because the energy - momentum tensor can not be both symmetric and covariantly conserved .",
    "we provided a solution to this problem by modifying the gravity simultaneously . in a concrete model , we considered the chern - simons modified electrodynamics which breaks lorentz and @xmath1 invariance .",
    "simultaneously the gravity is also modified by a chern - simons term .",
    "the phenomenologies of this model on cmb and the late - time dynamics of relic gravitational waves have been studied . for these modifications ,",
    "the gravitational chern - simons term generates non - vanished @xmath12 and @xmath13 cross - correlations of cmb at the last scattering surface and leave others unchanged .",
    "after that , the electromagnetic chern - simons term will rotate the generated @xmath10-mode polarizations to @xmath11-mode ones and change all but @xmath76 spectra . for the late - time evolution of the relic gravitational waves",
    ", we found that the chern - simons term mainly contribute to the amplitude of gwb inside the horizon . in this case , the energy spectrum of gwb is suppressed at high - frequency regime , which depends on an effective mass brought by the chern - simons term . from the current result , we notice that this effect is hard to be detected by recent experiments .",
    "however , the studies on gravitational models with various lorentz violations @xcite and their gravitational perturbations @xcite are particularly of theoretical interests .",
    "this model deserves further studies .",
    "it will be interesting to seek for kerr - newmann type solutions for the spacetime metric in the region surrounding a charged and rotating celestial body .    in the literature",
    ", there is another class of lorentz violating theories in which the lorentz symmetry is broken spontaneously , for example , the external vector is replaced by the derivative of a dynamical scalar field , @xmath170 . in this case , we should include the kinetic term and the potential of @xmath171 in the action . during the evolution of the universe , the scalar field develops a non - zero @xmath172 and the lorentz symmetry",
    "is broken in this background .",
    "such lorentz violation has been used to generate the baryon number asymmetry observed in our universe @xcite .",
    "the scalar field may be the dynamical dark energy @xcite or the curvature scalar @xcite . in this case",
    ", there is no problem of consistency and it is not necessary to modify the gravity theory @xcite .",
    "for example , in the maxwell - chern - simons theory considered in eq .",
    "( [ chernsimons ] ) , if @xmath170 and the kinetic term and potential of @xmath171 are included , the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath173 is symmetric and divergence free even though @xmath28 and @xmath174 are not covariantly conserved individually .",
    "the divergence of @xmath28 is canceled by that of @xmath174 . an interesting effect in this case",
    "is that the rotation angle of the photon is dynamical and spacetime dependent @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank jun - qing xia for discussions .",
