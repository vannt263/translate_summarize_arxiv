    "the submillimeter array ( sma ) , a collaboration between the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and the academica sinica institute for astronomy and astrophysics , is an eight - element , heterodyne radio - interferometer designed to operate throughout the major atmospheric windows from about 180 to 900  ghz .",
    "it is the first and only imaging interferometer to operate in the submillimeter band .",
    "the general design and operation of the sma has been described previously @xcite .",
    "located near the 4200-meter summit of mauna kea , hawaii , the array was dedicated in november 2003 and initial science results were collected in a 2004 special issue of _ the astrophysical journal _",
    "the first sma results at 690  ghz were published in 2004 based on observations of the carbon star irc+10216 obtained with only three antennas @xcite . since that time ,",
    "the second if path of the sma has been built and commissioned and improvements to the 690  ghz receivers and local oscillator ( lo ) control hardware has enabled fully - remote , dual - frequency operation for the first time . with this capability , the prospects for `` phase referenced calibration '' ( i.e. scaling the measured atmospheric phase from a low frequency band to a high frequency band ) can now be evaluated .",
    "this paper summarizes the present system and presents the first results obtained during a special observing campaign during january - february 2005 .",
    "the sma 6-meter antennas are composed of 72 panels with 4 adjusting screws per panel .",
    "the surface is accurately measured ( to @xmath2 m rms ) via near - field holography and the required screw adjustments to correct the surface are computed @xcite . in preparation for 650  ghz work , all antennas were adjusted in this manner to improve the surface accuracy . as of february 2005 , all antennas were better than @xmath3 m rms with the best antenna being @xmath4 m rms ( see table table  [ rms ] ) .",
    "confirmation of the antenna surface accuracy , especially at elevations different from the beacon ( i.e. @xmath5  deg ) , has been obtained via aperture efficiency measurements on celestial objects ( planets ) .",

    "peak = 9.9  jy , rms=51  mjy , snr=193 .",
    "the degree to which the images are similar verifies the promise of this technique .",
    ", width=336 ]",
    "the sma has successfully observed celestial sources in two frequency bands simultaneously ( 230 and 690  ghz ) .",
    "the first astronomical images with one arcsecond angular resolution in the 690  ghz band have been acquired .",
    "initial observations of sources with strong maser lines in both bands demonstrate good correlation between the phases in the two widely - separated frequency bands , at least on most of the antennas .",
    "although a number of instrumental issues with the sma remain to be explored and improved , this initial result does bode well for future attempts at phase referencing the interferometer calibration from low frequencies to high frequencies the submillimeter band ( and perhaps the terahertz band ) , and thereby improving the ultimate sensitivity of traditional heterodyne interferometers at high frequencies .",
    "the authors would like to thank irwin shapiro for supporting the development of the sma from its inception .",
    "we extend special thanks to those of hawaiian ancestry on whose sacred mountain we are privileged to be guests .",

    "<S> the array was designed to allow simultaneous operation of a low frequency receiver ( @xmath0  ghz ) with a high frequency receiver ( @xmath1  ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap region of 330 - 350  ghz was included to facilitate dual polarization measurements in the frequency range considered to offer the highest sensitivity for continuum observations with the array .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , the array is equipped with working sis receivers covering the frequency ranges 176 - 256  ghz , 260 - 350  ghz , and 600 - 700  ghz , and single frequency operation has been routine in the lower two frequency bands for the past year . more recently , with the completion of if hardware required to make full use of the sma cross - correlator , dual receiver operation became possible . </S>",
    "<S> we have since made a number of galactic and extra - galactic astronomical observations in dual - band mode with the hopes of using the 230  ghz receiver as a phase reference to enable improved interferometry in the 650  ghz band </S>",
    "<S> . we will present the current antenna and receiver performance , some of the first interferometric images in the 650  ghz receiver band , and our initial attempts at phase transfer . </S>"
