    "this work is motivated by the problem of suppressing various types of artifacts in recordings of neural activity . in a recent study @xcite , typical artifacts in _ in vivo _",
    "neural recordings are classified into four types ( type 0 to 3 , see section 2.2 and figure  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "this classification covers many artifacts in the scope of human brain activity recordings , e.g. , electroencephalography ( eeg ) and electrocorticography ( ecog ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the suppression of type 0 and type 1 artifacts . for the purpose of flexibility and generality ,",
    "we redefine them in terms of morphological characteristics :    * type 0 : a smooth protuberance that can be modeled as @xmath1 , when @xmath2 . * type 1 : an abrupt jump followed by an exponential decay that can be modeled as @xmath3 , when @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : etea_example_0_type ] shows examples of the two types of artifacts .",
    "we do not consider the other two types in this work because our previous works have addressed efficient algorithms to remove such artifacts .",
    "for instance , low - pass filtering / total variation denoising ( @xmath4 ) @xcite suppresses type 2 artifacts ( figure  [ fig : etea_example_0_type]c ) , and lowpass filtering / compound sparse denoising ( lpf / csd ) @xcite can remove sparse and blocky spikes ( type 3 shown in figure  [ fig : etea_example_0_type]d ) .",
    "+    the approach proposed in this paper is based on an optimization problem intended to capture the primary morphological characteristics of the artifacts using sparsity - inducing regularization . to formulate the problem",
    ", we model the observed time series as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a lowpass signal , @xmath7 is a piecewise smooth transient signal ( i.e. , type 0 or type 1 artifacts ) , and @xmath8 is stationary white gaussian noise .",
    "more specifically , @xmath6 is assumed to be restricted to a certain range of low frequencies . in other words , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a high - pass filter .",
    "note that in the signal model , conventional lti filtering is not suitable to estimate either @xmath6 or @xmath7 from @xmath11 , because component @xmath7 , as a piecewise smooth signal comprised of transients , is not band limited .    in order to estimate the components , we combine lti filtering with sparsity - based techniques .",
    "we formulate an optimization problem for both decomposition and denoising .",
    "a computationally efficient algorithm is derived to solve the optimization problem , based on the theory of majorization - minimization ( mm ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , this paper specifies how to generate a smoothed penalty function and its majorizer from a non - smooth one , in order to overcome a numerical issue that arises when the penalty function is not differentiable .",
    "[ tab : etea_penalty ]      some recent works recover signals with transients by various algorithms . in @xcite ,",
    "a slowly varying signal is modeled as a local polynomial and an optimization problem using tikhonov regularization is formulated to capture it . in @xcite , the slowly varying trend is modeled as a higher - order sparse - derivative signal ( e.g. , the third - order derivative is sparse ) .    instead of estimating the slowly varying component via regularization , the @xmath4 method @xcite estimates a lowpass component by lti filtering and a piecewise constant component by optimization . in this case , an optimization problem is formulated to estimate the piecewise constant component .",
    "the approach proposed here uses a similar technique to recover the lowpass component , but in contrast to @xmath4 , it is more general  the regularization is more flexible with a tunable parameter , so that @xmath4 can be considered as a special case .",
    "another algorithm related to the approach taken in this paper is the transient artifact reduction algorithm ( tara ) @xcite which is utilized to suppress additive piecewise constant artifacts and spikes ( similar to a hybrid of type  2 and type  3 artifact ) .",
    "the approaches proposed in this work target different types of artifacts ( type  0 and type  1 ) and applied in different applications .",
    "the irregularity of type 0 transients leads to a more complicated artifact removal problem , where the artifact are irregular fluctuations .",

    "the regularizers adopted in @xmath12 and second - order @xmath12 coincide with first - order and second - order cases of generalized 1-d total variation , respectively .",
    "some differences to the problem discussed in @xcite are as follow .",
    "firstly , the signal model allows a lowpass baseline as a component , hence , @xmath12 can be seen as a combination of conventional lti filtering and generalized 1-d total variation .",

    "an example of complicated and irregular artifacts is the eye blink / movement artifacts in eeg data , which may have various morphologies and durations . in this case , we assume that the artifacts can be estimated by a continuous piecewise smooth waveform , generated by applying a certain sparse impulse sequence to @xmath180 .",
    "in other words , we broaden our signal model so that the artifact is not only equivalent to an isolated type 0 transient as in @xcite , but also a superposition of multiple such transients , with some freedom of scaling and shifting . the problem of estimating @xmath7 can be solved by in this case as well .",

    "the emd based method achieves a decent denoising performance , but does not accurately estimate the components .",
    "for instance , the simulated data has a smooth dip at about @xmath189 ( circled in figure  [ fig : etea2_example_1_x]a ) .",

    "we may group the lowpass and transient components differently to avoid this problem , for instance , grouping imf 1 - 6 together in order to include more oscillations into transient component , but this causes other distortion , where the decomposed transient component contains a lowpass signal and does not adhere to a baseline of zero .",

    "in addition , @xmath84 should not be too small or very close to 1 .",

    "for such a signal , other algorithms are more suitable , e.g. , lpf / csd @xcite .",
    "similarly , if @xmath84 has to be very close to 1 to fit the transients , then the transients must be very close to a piecewise linear signal , which is also not how we model the signal initially . as a consequence ,",
