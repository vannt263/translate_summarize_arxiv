    "the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe is a major challenge to present - day cosmology .",
    "the converging observational evidence comes from a diverse set of cosmological data which includes observations of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite , constraints from sdss galaxy clustering @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite and weak lensing @xcite .",
    "a plethora of theories have been proposed to explain this late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "the simplest explanation is provided by a cosmological constant , however , this scenario is plagued by a severe fine - tuning problem associated with its energy scale @xcite .",
    "hence one has two main directions in order to seek for an alternative explanation , namely , either to introduce the concept of an exotic repulsive cosmic fluid denoted by `` dark energy '' in the framework of general relativity @xcite , or to modify the gravitational sector itself @xcite .",
    "all of these modifications to the einstein - hilbert action are based on the curvature description of gravity . however , an interesting and rich class of modified gravity can arise if one modifies the action of the equivalent torsional formulation of general relativity , known as `` teleparallel equivalent of general relativity '' ( tegr ) @xcite . thus",
    ", if one desires to modify gravity starting from this formulation , the simplest model is to extend the torsion scalar @xmath0 in the lagrangian to an arbitrary function @xmath1 @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , an extension of @xmath1 gravity was proposed in which the torsion scalar is coupled non - minimally to the matter sector @xcite .",
    "this theory is a novel gravitational modification , since it is different from both @xmath1 gravity , as well as from the original nonminimal curvature - matter - coupled theory @xcite .",
    "additionally , the cosmological applications of this new theory proves to be very interesting @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a wide variety of cosmological scenarios were obtained , such as an effective dark energy sector whose equation - of - state parameter can be quintessence or phantom - like , or exhibit the phantom - divide crossing , while for a large range of the model parameters the universe results in a de sitter , dark - energy - dominated , accelerating phase . furthermore , early - time inflationary solutions were also obtained , and thus these models provide a unified description of the cosmological history .",
    "it is interesting to note , that along these lines of research , another extension of @xmath1 gravity was also proposed @xcite ( motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite ) , that allowed for a general coupling of the torsion scalar @xmath0 with the trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting @xmath3 theory also possesses interesting cosmological phenomenology , leading to a unified description of the initial inflationary phase , the subsequent non - accelerating , matter - dominated expansion , and then the transition to a late - time accelerating phase .",
    "additionally , a detailed study of the scalar perturbations at the linear level revealed that @xmath3 cosmology may be free of ghosts and instabilities for a wide class of the model parameters .    in the present paper , we are interested in performing a detailed phase space analysis of the non - minimal torsion - matter coupling , and explore the phenomenology associated to some specific models .",
    "in particular , we apply the dynamical system approach , developed amongst others by ellis and wainwright @xcite .",
    "this approach is able to by - pass the non - linearities of the cosmological equations , that forbid an analytical treatment , and allow for the extraction of the general features and global behavior of the evolution , independently of the specific initial conditions . using this technique",
    "we will be able to show that this class of models often present a matter - dominated epoch and that providing suitable forms for the functions of torsion , that appear in the theory , the universe evolves towards a late - time acceleration .",
    "the manuscript is organised in the following manner : in section , [ ftmodel ] we briefly review the scenario of non - minimally torsion - matter coupled gravity and provide the corresponding cosmological equations . in section , [ msan1 ] we perform the dynamical analysis of this class of cosmologies , focusing on three different models . in section [ msan2 ] , for completeness",
    ", we present an alternative approach to the problem , which offers complementary information in relation to the first formulation .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions and discussion .",
    "the action of non - minimally torsion - matter coupled gravity can be written in the following manner @xcite @xmath4 } , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 ) are arbitrary functions of the torsion scalar @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are respectively the torsion tensor , the contortion tensor and the `` superpotential '' @xcite .    varying the action with respect to the tetrad @xmath10 yields the field equations @xmath11 where we have defined @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with the prime denoting differentiation with respect to the torsion scalar .",
    "the matter energy - momentum tensor is defined as @xmath14 in a purely space - time form , the bianchi identities of teleparallel gravity imply the relationship @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the covariant derivative in the levi - civita connection @xcite .",
    "additionally , we have assumed that the matter lagrangian @xmath17 , depends only on the tetrad and not on its derivatives .",
    "thus , the coupling between the matter and torsion describes an exchange of energy and momentum between both .    in order to obtain a cosmological model governed by @xmath1 gravity",
    ", we have to impose the usual homogeneity and isotropy conditions .",
    "therefore , we consider the common choice for the tetrad field , given by @xmath18 which corresponds to a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background , with @xmath19 the scale factor . since the lagrangian density of a perfect fluid is the energy scalar , representing the energy in a local rest frame for the fluid , a possible `` natural choice '' for the matter lagrangian density is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "however , we mention that in the presence of non - minimal couplings in which the matter lagrangian appears explicitly in the gravitational field equations , special care should be taken ( we refer the reader to @xcite for more details ) .",
    "nevertheless , throughout this work we consider @xmath20 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath21 , and also the usual form of the energy - momentum tensor for the perfect fluid is given by @xmath22 one can see that the energy - momentum tensor is again conserved , just like in teleparallel gravity or @xmath1 theories , since eq .",
    "yields the continuity equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hubble parameter and @xmath25 is the equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter of matter . in the above expressions the dot represents a derivatives with respect to cosmic time .    inserting the flat frw vierbein choice ( [ weproudlyuse ] ) into the field equations we obtain the modified friedmann equations @xcite @xmath26 where we have defined @xmath27 .",
    "note that a useful relation arising from the choice of the tetrad is that the torsion scalar is proportional to the square of the hubble parameter , namely @xmath28 .",
    "the generalized friedmann equations can be rewritten in the standard form @xmath29 where the effective energy density and effective pressure of the dark energy sector are defined as @xmath30 @xmath31 respectively .",
    "one can easily verify that the dark energy density and pressure satisfy the continuity equation @xmath32 in accordance with eqs . and .",
    "we have defined the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter as usual , namely , @xmath33 .",
    "in order to perform the phase - space analysis of the cosmological scenario at hand , we have to introduce suitable dimensionless auxiliary variables that will bring the system of cosmological equations into its autonomous form @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath34 and the logarithmic time @xmath35 . with this choice , and taking in account that @xmath36 , the case of a standard @xmath1 theory is recovered when @xmath37 .    using the variables the cosmological equations are equivalent to the autonomous system @xmath38 with @xmath27 , as defined above , and where @xmath39 are functions only of @xmath0 .",
    "their expression in terms of the variables can be obtained noting that @xmath40 inverting the above equation for a given form of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , one obtains @xmath43 and the system can be closed .",
    "it is important to stress at this point that since @xmath36 must be non positive , the requirement that @xmath44 implies that only some parts of the phase space defined by those variables will have actual physical meaning .",
    "in fact , this restriction implies that even if some physically interesting fixed points are present there might not be physical orbits that connect them . additionally , note that since we have used the third equation of to eliminate @xmath45 , we might need to discard the @xmath46 part of the phase space .    using the dimensionless variables from eqs . and",
    ", the dark - energy density parameter is written as @xmath47 due to the definition the physically relevant part of the phase space will necessarily have @xmath48 , however , since @xmath49 does not need to be defined positive , @xmath45 is not necessarily less than one . in the following however , we will require , at least for the matter - dominated fixed points , that @xmath50 and therefore that @xmath51 .    the solutions associated to the fixed points can be obtained using the equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant and an asterisk represents the value of a variable at the fixed point @xmath54,@xmath55}. hence , the solutions obtained in this way are all scaling solutions which can alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite .",

    "recently , a generalized @xmath1 gravity theory with a nonminimal coupling between matter and the torsion scalar was proposed in @xcite . from the physical point of view , in this theory , matter is not just a passive component in the space - time continuum ; rather , it plays an active role in the overall gravitational dynamics , which is strongly modified due to the supplementary interaction between matter and geometry @xcite .",
    "moreover , the major advantage of the @xmath1-type models , namely that the field equations are of second order , is not modified by the torsion - matter coupling @xcite .    in this work we have performed a detailed phase - space analysis for this scenario , proposing two new approaches . the first one , although in principle more general , turns out to lead to complications , not only in terms of the dynamical equations , but also in terms of external constraints that have to be considered during the dynamical analysis .",
    "hence , we have developed a second method , which can be alternatively used in cases where the above complexities make the application of the first method difficult , since in this approach all constraints are included in the initial equations . definitely , the physical results do not depend on the specific mathematical method used , and thus one can choose the easier method according to the specific problem .",
    "we have analyzed six specific models of non - minimally matter - torsion coupled cosmology . in general",
    "we have extracted fixed points corresponding either to dark - matter dominated , scaling decelerated solutions , or to dark - energy dominated accelerated solutions . additionally , note that there is a small parameter region in which the model can experience the transition from the matter epoch to dark - energy era .",
    "this feature is in agreement with the observed universe evolution , and can not be easily obtained in dark energy models .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in both the approaches reveal that there are sets of initial conditions for which the models evolve towards singular states for the equations .",
    "this tendency is a signal of instability related with certain specific forms of the coupling functions and this feature constraints even more the viable parameter space of these models .",
    "we mention that in the present analysis we have focused on the finite regions of the phase space , without examining the possible non - trivial behavior at infinity , since such an extended investigation would lie beyond the scopes of this work , which is just to reveal the capabilities of the theory in producing a cosmology in agreement with observations .",
    "as we showed this is possible , and hence non - minimally matter - torsion coupled gravity may be a successful candidate for the description of nature .",
