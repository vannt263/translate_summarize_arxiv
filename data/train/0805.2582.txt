    "the measurements of lilly et al . @xcite and du",
    "et al.@xcite reveal strong anisotropic transport properties of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) for the half - filled landau - level system for high landau - levels ( ll ) and at very low temperature .",
    "the anisotropic behavior in the transport properties is consistent with stripe and bubble charge - density - wave phases which were predicted early on in refs .   by means of hartree - fock calculations of the 2deg and",
    "were confirmed more recently by numerical studies of systems with up to 12 electrons@xcite .",
    "however , fradkin et al.@xcite have challenged this interpretation and suggested that the anisotropic transport might be due to a possible nematic phase of the 2deg in a magnetic field .",
    "this idea finds support in the good comparison between the results of the temperature dependence of the anisotropy of the resistivity obtained by means of a monte carlo simulation of the nematic phase@xcite with that which has been experimentally observed .",
    "in addition , the idea is supported by the experiments of cooper et al.@xcite where an in - plane magnetic field was applied in the 2deg and the results of the experiment were interpreted on the basis of the presence of a nematic state ; further support of the idea is provided by the fact that the theoretically estimated transition temperature from an isotropic to nematic phase@xcite is of similar magnitude as the experimentally determined temperature at which the on - set of the anisotropic transport occurs .",
    "rather recently we have presented@xcite a variational calculation of the nematic state as ground state of the half - filled landau - level system in a magnetic field based on an ansatz ground state wavefunction proposed by oganesyan et al .",
    "@xcite which is of the jastrow - slater form and is given by the following expression : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the projection operator onto the lowest ll , @xmath2 are two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane - wave states . here , @xmath3 is the complex 2d coordinate of the @xmath4 electron .",
    "this wavefunction is a jastrow correlated slater determinant with jastrow part similar to the laughlin state @xcite .",
    "this ground - state wavefunction has the same form as the form proposed by rezayi and read@xcite , however , the single - particle momenta form an elliptical fermi sea as opposed to the circular fermi sea .",
    "there is a broken - symmetry parameter which is the ratio @xmath5 of the semi - major @xmath6 and semi - minor @xmath7 axes of the elliptic fermi sea . using this wave function to describe the nematic state we had carried out a variational study of the half - filled system using the so - called fermi - hypernetted - chain ( fhnc ) approximation@xcite .",
    "the results of the above mentioned variational calculation indicate that there is a certain value of the parameter @xmath8 ( @xmath8 is proportional to the 2deg layer thickness@xcite ) below which the nematic state is energetically favorable as compared to the isotropic and the stripe - ordered ground states for the second excited ll .",
    "it is interesting to note that this critical value of @xmath8 is very close to the value of @xmath8 which can be estimated based on the actual experimental conditions which are applicable for the case of the data by lilly et al.@xcite and by du et al.@xcite .",
    "however , one of the weak points of the above described variational study is the fact that the fhnc approximation is plagued by an unknown - size error and the results can not be improved in a controlled manner@xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a need to check the validity of these results and conclusions using the variational monte carlo method and this task is undertaken in the present work .",
    "there is a different variational approach to the problem of a broken rotational state of the half - filled ll introduced by ciftja and wexler@xcite .",
    "they have used the fermi - hypernetted - chain ( fhnc ) approximation to study a broken rotational state of the half - filled ll where the symmetry - breaking parameter was introduced in the correlation part of the wavefunction as @xmath9 , and they used the standard single - particle determinant with a circular fermi sea .    in this and in the work of ref .  , we considered the unprojected wavefunction of the nematic state .",
    "the advantage of this simplified version is that it has a jastrow form with a slater determinant so it can be applied directly with fhnc and it allows us to study large - size systems using the variational monte carlo method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we discuss the formulation and the procedure ; in sec .",
    "[ mc_results ] we present the results and we compare them with those obtained for the case of a stripe - ordered state and the isotropic state . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we summarize the conclusions of the present calculation .",
    "we have adopted the toroidal geometry of a square with periodic boundary conditions . this geometry has the advantage of naturally adapting to the nematic and isotropic state wavefunction .",
    "there are several steps in applying the mc approach for this problem .",
    "first , as part of the wavefunction of nematic state we construct a slater determinant of plane waves characterized by momentum vectors which lie inside an elliptical fermi sea .",
    "second , since the pseudo - potential is @xmath10 , which is a long - range interaction , we need to to take into account all periodic image charge interactions .",
    "one of the methods to do this is the ewald summation technique . in subsection [ ewald ] of the appendix",
    "we describe the ewald summation technique for the case of toroidal boundary conditions and the @xmath10 interaction . in the present section",
    "we will discuss our implementation of the mc to study the nematic state .    given a value of @xmath11",
    "there are definite values of the number of particles @xmath12 which correspond to a closed shell .",
    "these definite values of @xmath12 are calculated as follows .",
    "the occupied states characterized by @xmath13 must satisfy the following condition : @xmath14 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the major and minor axis of the fermi sea and given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the uniform particle density of the system . for a finite system of size @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "so one can deduce the conditions for @xmath22 such that : @xmath23 for a value of @xmath12 to be acceptable the number of states , i.e. , the number of pairs @xmath24 satisfying the above inequality should be equal to @xmath12 .",
    "for example , for @xmath25 , @xmath12 can be @xmath26 ; for @xmath27 , they can be @xmath28    0.3 in    cc +    0.3 in    in figs .",
    "[ k89 ] , we present two examples of closed shell which correspond to @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 . notice that with anisotropy parameter @xmath32 , the occupied states ( i.e those satisfying equation [ n_x_n_y ] ) are anisotropically distributed along the preferred @xmath33 axis . in our mc calculation",
    "we will use these cases as well as larger size systems up to 145 particles .",
    "we follow the metropolis mc scheme for sampling the wavefunction where the ratio needed between the new and the old wavefunction is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the periodic pseudo - potential which is derived in the subsection ( [ ewald ] ) of the appendix . to carry out the calculation of the ratio between the slater determinant of the new configuration and the old configuration efficiently",
    ", we use the inverse updating technique developed by ceperley et al.@xcite .",
    "we found that the number of mc steps needed for `` thermalization '' is of the order of @xmath36 and we use of the order of @xmath37 mc steps to calculate averages of the distribution function .",

    ".    we use the single mode approximation to calculate the interaction energy at high ll ( equation [ v_l ] ) and we are only interested in obtaining the pair distribution function @xmath43 . the kinetic energy advantage of the isotropic phase over the nematic phase is calculated in the subsection ( [ kinetic ] ) pf the appendix .",
    "the approach can be divided into the following steps :    * the pair distribution function for the lll for different anisotropic parameters @xmath11 is calculated . *",
    "the single mode approximation@xcite is used to calculate the interaction energies at a high ll . *",
    "the kinetic energy for different anisotropic parameters is evaluated ( see appendix [ kinetic ] ) .",

    "the optimum value of @xmath11 is determined by minimizing the total energy . * the hf results which have been reported so far@xcite correspond to the case of @xmath44 .",

    "[ lambda ] for @xmath45 .",
    "the optimum total energies of the nematic states will be compared with those of the stripe states at different values of @xmath8 for the 2@xmath46 excited ll to determine a critical value of @xmath8 below which the nematic state maybe energetically favorable . *",
    "the above mentioned critical value of @xmath8 is compared with the value which corresponds to those samples used in the experiment@xcite . *",
    "a comparison of the mc results to the ones obtained by fhnc will also be presented .",
    "the pair distribution function @xmath47 obtained using mc integration has important differences when compared to @xmath47 obtained by fhnc@xcite as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ g_fhnc_mc ] .",
    "thus , it is important to obtain the energies of the nematic state at high ll by mc and to compare them with those obtained by fhnc .",
    "we first compare the interaction energies obtained for different values of @xmath48 with the potential energy of the isotropic state ( @xmath25 ) ( figs .",
    "[ v_0_mc ] and [ v_1_mc ] ) .",
    "notice from figs .",
    "[ v_0_mc ] and [ v_1_mc ] that the potential energy of the isotropic state is lower than the potential energy of the nematic state for the 1@xmath49 excited ll and lll for all values of the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the potential energy is calculated with the pseudo - potential obtained using the ewald sum as discussed in subsection ( [ ewald ] ) of the appendix .",
    "essentially the same result is also found with a pseudo - potential obtained using the lekner summation technique@xcite .",
    "furthermore , as shown in appendix [ kinetic ] , the kinetic energy of the isotropic state is below that of the nematic state , and , thus , the total energy of the isotropic state is always lower than that of the nematic state .",
    "hence , our mc calculation shows that the isotropic state is energetically favorable as compared to the nematic state for the lll and the 1@xmath49 excited ll for all values of the parameter @xmath8 .",

    "[ v_2_mc ] . the conclusion which can be drawn from the comparison of fig .",
    "[ v_2_mc ] is that the interaction energy of the nematic state is lower than that of the isotropic state for all values of @xmath8 .",

    "[ e_2_mc ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ e_2_mc ] , we conclude that the nematic state is energetically favorable as compared to the isotropic state for the 2@xmath46 excited ll for the range of the parameter @xmath51 .",

    "the stripe - ordered phase was predicted based on hf calculations and this ordering can also explain the anisotropy observed in the transport properties of the 2deg at low temperature .",
    "therefore , we need to investigate the stability of the nematic state against the stripe - ordered state as follows .",
    "first , we find the optimum energies of the nematic state with respect to the anisotropic parameter @xmath11 for various values of @xmath8 .",
    "next , we compare these with the optimum energies of the stripe state obtained by the hf approximation@xcite .",

    "the optimum energy is obtained by minimizing the energy with respect to the uniaxial anisotropy parameter @xmath54 defined in ref .  .",
    "[ ewald_mc_hf ] shows the comparison of the optimal energies obtained by mc for the nematic state with the optimum ( with respect to @xmath54 ) energy for the stripe state obtained by hf .",
    "note that , for @xmath55 , the optimum nematic state is obtained for @xmath25 , i.e. , it is the isotropic state .",

    "we have also carried out the same calculation using the lekner summation technique and the results obtained are in good agreement with those obtained using the ewald summation method .",
    "thus , we can conclude that with mc calculation , for @xmath57 , the energy of the nematic state is lower than the stripe - ordered state .",
    "in fig .  [ ewald_mc_fhnc ] the results for the optimum total energy of the nematic state obtained with the variational mc method is compared with that obtained by fhnc in ref .   and with the optimum energy of the stripe - ordered state .",
    "the critical value of @xmath58 we found from fhnc@xcite is @xmath59 which is close to the value of 0.37 obtained above by mc",
    ". the critical value of @xmath8 corresponding to the sample used in experiment @xcite which was calculated in ref .  , using the conditions of the experiment and sample characteristics , is approximately @xmath60 , which can be below the critical value found above .",
    "thus , both mc and fhnc calculations indicate that the nematic state might be the state observed experimentally for the 2deg at the heterojunction in the samples used in experiment described in ref ..    0.3 in     0.3 in    there is still a remaining question about the validity of our approximation to neglect the projection operator in the wavefunction ( [ wf ] ) .",
    "however , in both fhnc treatments of the problem@xcite , where , in addition to neglecting the projection operator for arguments presented there , there was a second rather annoying question ( and rather straightforward to answer ) of the validity of the fhnc approximation in evaluating the energy expectation value . in the present paper the latter question is answered by employing the monte carlo method .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the present calculations eliminates the suspicion that the conclusions drawn in ref .   might be due to an artifact of the fhnc approximation employed in ref .  .",
    "the long - range nature of the pseudo - potential @xmath10 which appears in the exponent of the wavefunction of the jastrow factor in the case of periodic boundary conditions requires a summation over all periodic image charges .",
    "specifically , the `` charge '' distribution required to give rise to a logarithmic interaction is given as : @xmath61 the two - dimensional ( 2d ) poisson equation is given by : @xmath62 and its solution in 2d is the logarithmic interaction .",
    "we need to solve the above equation for a periodic square @xmath63 .",

    "the other combined charge configuration , i.e. , @xmath68 , consisting of the gaussian and the background charge and the corresponding potential is denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath69 is a long - range potential it will be calculated in fourier space .",
    "the solution to each of the poisson s equations for the two charge distributions and the corresponding potential is straightforward .",

    "for the ewald summation , the convergence of ( [ ewald_1 ] ) and ( [ ewald_2 ] ) is achieved choosing the width of the gaussian charge distribution @xmath76 , the number of cells for the sum in ( [ ewald_2 ] ) to be 10 and by carrying out the sum in momentum space in ( [ ewald_1 ] ) over 200 k - states .    in order to check the validity of this approach for the case of our use of toroidal boundary conditions we calculated the distribution function and the energy for the 1/3 ( @xmath77 ) case using the expressions ( [ ewald_1],[ewald_2 ] ) and our results for the energy and distribution function are identical to the results of morf and halperin@xcite who used the disk geometry .      in this subsection of the appendix",

    "the kinetic energy is quenched .",
    "in addition , the same is true in the hf treatment of the stripe , namely , there is no kinetic energy due to any correlation factors or operators .",
    "while this approximation gives a significant difference between the potential energy of the isotropic state and the nematic state , it gives no difference between their kinetic energy which is unacceptable because of the difference in the geometry of the fermi sea .",
