    "@xcite    in the present work we propose a novel way to generate a giant effective soi in gnrs by spatially varying magnetic fields that can be produced by nanomagnets .",
    "@xcite this approach has an advantage over using adatoms because the surface of graphene is not in tunnel - contact with other atoms , which usually leads to high disorder with strong intervalley scattering . as we will see , large values of soi result in helical modes of nearly perfect polarization .",
    "moreover , nanoribbons , in stark contrast to semiconducting nanowires , have considerably larger subband splittings , allowing for a superior control of the number of propagating modes and of the gaps that are characteristic for the helical regime .",
    "further , our proposal is a next step in bringing topological features to graphene systems .",
    "topological states proposed by kane and mele @xcite turned out to be experimentally undetectable due to the small intrinsic soi of graphene . in contast , we show here that if a gnr in the helical regime is brought into proximity to an s - wave superconductor , the system can be tuned into a topological phase that supports majorana fermions .",
