    "a striking feature of the white dwarfs and the neutron stars is the wide range of magnetic field strengths seen in each of these groups . in isolated magnetic white dwarfs ( about 15 percent of the total white dwarf population ) , the field strengths are measured directly through the zeeman effect and range from @xmath8  g. in isolated radio pulsars , the field estimates are in the range @xmath9  g and are based on the measured spin down rates and the assumption of dipole radiation .",
    "observations in the x and @xmath10-ray spectral regions have revealed the presence of a class of neutron stars with higher inferred fields , namely the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "these neutron stars are often referred to as `` magnetars '' and have estimated field strengths in the range @xmath11  g.    possible explanations for the magnetic fields in neutron stars are that the fields are either ( i ) essentially of fossil origin ( e.g. rudermann 1972 ) or ( ii ) generated by a convective dynamo ( thompson & duncan 1993 ) . at the present time , this issue remains unresolved ( see mestel , 1999 , for a comprehensive review ) . in the case of the white dwarfs , a direct link can be made between magnetism in the compact star phase and the main sequence via the well documented properties of the chemically peculiar ap and bp stars ( wickramasinghe & ferrario 2005 ) and has been a major factor supporting ( i ) for the white dwarfs .",
    "magnetism is not as well documented in the more massive ( @xmath12 ) upper main sequence stars that evolve into neutron stars .",
    "the only known stars with a directly measured magnetic field are @xmath13 orion c , with a dipolar magnetic field @xmath14  g ( donati et al .",
    "2002 ) , and hd191612 with a field of @xmath15  g ( donati et al .",
    "their mass is estimated around @xmath16 , with the latter star slightly more evolved than the former .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic fluxes of both these stars ( @xmath17 g  cm@xmath1 for @xmath13 orion c and @xmath19 g  cm@xmath1 for hd191612 ) are comparable to the flux of the highest field magnetar sgr  1806 - 20 ( @xmath20 g  cm@xmath1 ) . there is also indirect evidence from studies of stellar winds from massive stars that magnetism may be widespread among ob stars ( e.g. wade 2001 ) .",
    "these facts , taken together with the scaling that exists between the dipolar field strengths of the white dwarfs and the neutron stars ( figure 1 ) , suggest that a prima facie case can be made for a fossil origin of fields also in the neutron stars .",
    "the fossil field hypothesis provides a natural explanation for the wide range of observed magnetic field strengths in a given class as being the result of inhomogeneities in the interstellar magnetic field strength in star forming regions .",
    "calculations of pre - main sequence evolution have shown that stars more massive than @xmath21 are likely to begin their main sequence phase with a primordial magnetic flux entrapped in radiative regions supporting the fossil hypothesis ( tout , livio & bonnell 1999 ; moss 2003 ) .",
    "there are no detailed studies on the interplay between fossil fields and subsequent stellar evolution .",
    "this problem has been discussed by tout , wickramasinghe & ferrario ( 2004 , hereafter twf ) .",
    "they argued that provided there are regions of the star that are radiative during subsequent evolution , a fossil main sequence poloidal magnetic flux could survive through to the compact star phase .",
    "= 0.98    in this paper , we investigate the consequences of the fossil field hypothesis for the origin of magnetic fields in neutron stars by carrying out population synthesis calculations for different assumptions on the distribution of the magnetic flux of massive ( @xmath12 ) main sequence stars and of the field dependence of the initial birth period of neutron stars . we model the observed properties of the population of isolated radio pulsars in the 1374 mhz parkes multi - beam survey ( pmbs , hobbs et al .",
    "2004 ; kramer et al . 2003 ; morris et al . 2002",
    "; manchester et al . 2001 ) to constrain our model parameters , and use these to deduce the required magnetic properties of the progenitor ob stars .",
    "we assume that neutron stars are formed in the galactic disc from stars with @xmath22 and that black holes form from larger mass stars .",
    "the situation is not as clear cut , from a theoretical point of view , because of the uncertainties in estimating the effects of fall - back ( e.g. heger et al .",
    "nonetheless , there is now overwhelming observational evidence that progenitors of neutron stars could be as massive as @xmath23 ( e.g. gaensler et al . 2005",
    "; muno et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we assume an initial mass function @xmath24 with a power law index @xmath25 ( kroupa 2002 ) , and a constant star formation rate @xmath26 at a given galacto - centric radius @xmath27 . the radial dependence of @xmath26 is obtained from the data presented by boissier et al .",
    "the stars are distributed perpendicularly to the galactic plane ( the @xmath28 direction ) exponentially using the scale heights as a function of initial mass given by rana ( 1987 ) supplemented at the high mass end by the observed wolf - rayet distribution of conti & vacca ( 1990 ) .",
    "these values range from a scale height of 100 pc for a @xmath29 star to 45 pc for a @xmath30 star , which is in agreement with the more recent results of reed ( 2000 ) .    unlike in the case of the white dwarfs , for the neutron stars the initial @xmath31 to final mass @xmath32 relationship",
    "is not well constrained by observations .",
    "masses are known for a handful of neutron stars , particularly in binaries , and these are observed to cluster around @xmath33 , close to the core collapse mass for an initial mass @xmath34 . in our calculations , we use the relationship obtained by heger , woosley & spruit ( 2005 ) .    in the simple model of twf",
    ", a star of mass @xmath35 that collapses from the interstellar medium entraps a magnetic flux that is proportional to the ambient interstellar ( primordial ) magnetic field @xmath36 and the square of its initial radius @xmath37 .",
    "if we assume an initially nearly uniform density , it follows that the magnetic flux @xmath38 .",
    "the variations expected in the interstellar magnetic field will then determine the distribution of magnetic fluxes in the progenitor stars .",
    "we parametrise the magnetic flux distribution @xmath39 by assuming that all massive stars are magnetic , and that the magnetic flux @xmath40 is given as the sum of two gaussians in the logarithm with dispersions @xmath41 and @xmath42 with appropriate weightings .",
    "the mean values are assumed to have the form @xmath43 where the subscript @xmath44 takes the values 1 and 2 for the two gaussians .",
    "the magnetic fluxes are in units of g  cm@xmath1 .      with the prescription of  2.1 , we generate neutron stars with a range of masses .",
    "our assumption that the magnetic flux is conserved during post main sequence evolution to the compact star phase allows us to calculate the birth surface magnetic fields of these neutron stars from : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the radius of the neutron star in cm given by the mass - radius relationship for neutron stars which depends on the equation of state .",
    "we adopt the values obtained with the unified sly equation of state of douchin & haensel ( 2001 ) .",
    "we follow the motions of these stars by integrating the equations of motion in the galactic potential of kuijken & gilmore ( 1989 ) assuming that they are born with a kick velocity that is independent of the progenitor mass and is given by a gaussian distribution ( e.g. hobbs et al . 2005 ) with velocity dispersion @xmath47 .",
    "radio pulsars are generally observed not to have a braking index of 3 ( e.g. cordes & chernoff 1998 ) .",
    "however , to minimise the number of free parameters we assume , in common with many other theoretical studies , that the spin down of radio pulsars is by dipole radiation : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the moment of inertia as derived by douchin & haensel ( 2001 ) and @xmath50 is the period in seconds .",
    "we have explicitly assumed that the time scale for field decay is longer than the ages of the pulsars , although the issue of whether field decay is necessary to explain their detailed properties remains an open question ( e.g. gonthier et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we may expect the birth period of the compact star to be determined by the magnetic flux of the progenitor star and its initial angular momentum ( e.g. brecher & chanmugam 1983 ; narayan 1987 ) .",
    "the complex interactions that occur between magnetic fields and rotation during stellar evolution and the mechanisms responsible for the transport of angular momentum are still poorly understood ( e.g. spruit & phinney 1998 ; watts & andersson 2002 ; fryer & warren 2004 ; heger et al .",
    "2005 ; ott et al .",
    "magnetic fields must play a role in transporting angular momentum outwards from the stellar core to the stellar envelope because otherwise all compact stars would be born at break up velocity , which is not the case ( e.g. migliazzo et al 2002 and kramer et al .",
    "heger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have considered this problem , but only in the weak field regime not directly relevant to the fossil field hypothesis .",
    "they report that the rotation periods they find are generally too small to explain pulsar observations . on the other hand ,",
    "ott et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have proposed that a propeller mechanism operating on fall - back material may slow down the rotation of pulsars at birth .",
    "we know that there is strong direct evidence for higher field objects to be slower rotators in the magnetic white dwarfs and we speculate that this may be a general characteristic of stars with magnetic fields of fossil origin ( see ferrario & wickramasinghe 2005 for scaling of rotation properties ) and thus allow for this possibility in our modelling .",
    "we model the birth spin periods of neutron stars @xmath51 by assuming they are distributed as a gaussian @xmath52 with a dispersion @xmath53 about a mean @xmath54 which depends linearly on the magnetic field    @xmath55    this is clearly a first approximation ( e.g. in fall back models , a field dependence @xmath56 may be more appropriate ) . for different assumed values of @xmath57 , we constrain the parameters @xmath58 , and @xmath53 by fitting the observations of isolated radio - pulsars in the pmbs taken from the atnf catalogue ( manchester et al .",
    "2005 ) .    to fit these observations",
    ", we also have to model the radio luminosity .",
    "guided by the expected power law dependence on @xmath50 and @xmath59 , and following previous investigators , we have assumed that the luminosity @xmath60 at 400  mhz can be described by a mean luminosity of the form @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",

    "2002 ) .    in our studies",
    ", we have adopted the radio death line predicted for a multipolar field configuration near the stellar surface in a space - charge - limited flow model ( zhang , harding & muslimov 2000 ) , that is : @xmath68      we calculate the total number of neutron stars in the galaxy with period up to @xmath50 by evaluating the integral @xmath69 here , @xmath27 ( in kpc ) is the galacto - centric radial coordinate , and @xmath70 is the galactic longitude .",
    "@xmath59 is calculated from equation [ pdotnow ] in appropriate units using the magnetic field @xmath71 derived from equation [ bf ] .",
    "the limits @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 are chosen to adequately sample the gaussian distributions .    to compare our theoretical calculations with the pmbs isolated pulsars",
    ", we need to know the current location of each star that can contribute to the integral . to achieve this ,",
    "we distribute the stars in velocity space according to the prescription of  2.2 with @xmath76 km s@xmath77 and in the @xmath28 direction according to their progenitors masses as detailed in  2.1 . their spatial location at the current epoch",
    "is then determined by solving the equations of motion in the galactic potential .",
    "the dispersion and scattering measures _ dm _ and _ sm _ of the pulsars are calculated using the fortran program of cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) .",
    "finally , the pulsar luminosities are assigned according to equations [ lm ] to [ dith ] .",
    "once all the intrinsic properties of our model pulsars are determined , these are fed through a filtering program kindly provided to us by natasa vranesevic ( 2005 , private communication ) that checks the pulsars for detectability by the pmbs .",
    "finally , since pulsars radio emission is anisotropic , we use the tauris & manchester ( 1998 ) beaming model to obtain the correct fraction of detected pulsars : @xmath78 ^ 2 + 0.03\\ ] ]",
    "our approach has been to focus on constraining the key parameters that we have introduced for describing the magnetic flux distribution on the main sequence and the distribution of the initial birth period assuming that the remaining parameters of the model are within the ranges given by previous investigators .",
    "we have used as our basic observational constraints the 1-d projections of the data comprising the number distributions in period @xmath50 , magnetic field @xmath79 , period derivative @xmath59 and radio luminosity @xmath80 , noting that these distributions are not all independent .",
    "= 0.8    the best fit model to the observations of the pmbs pulsars was determined `` by eye '' after conducting hundreds of trials .",

    "our results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the initial period distribution is described by @xmath81  s , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the magnetic flux distribution is described by two gaussians of means and spreads @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , @xmath87 respectively , weighted in the ratio @xmath88 .",
    "the parameters for the luminosity model are @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this model reproduces the observed total number of pulsars in the pmbs , once we exclude the millisecond pulsars ( @xmath91  ms ) .",
    "the star formation rate is normalised to @xmath92 pc@xmath93 gyr@xmath77 at the galacto - centric radius of the sun , which is within the uncertainty in the boissier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) relationship .",
    "this corresponds to a galactic supernova rate of 2 per century .    in a broad sense , the distribution that we use for the magnetic flux",
    "has the strongest influence on the location of the peak in the magnetic field distribution of the pulsars , while the mean period @xmath58 and the width of the period distribution @xmath53 have a strong influence on the period distribution , although clearly period and field distributions are inter - linked through period evolution which depends on the magnetic field .",
    "we find that we can not model both the field distribution and the period distribution at the same time if we assume that all pulsars are born at a period less than @xmath94  ms .",
    "such models give an excess of stars at low periods which is not consistent with the results of vranesevic et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who find that up to 40 percent of pulsars are born with periods in the range 0.1 - 0.5  s. regimbau & freitas pacheco ( 2001 ) also noted that most pulsars are born with @xmath95  s and conduct their population synthesis studies using a gaussian with a mean birth period @xmath96  s and a spread of 0.1  s while faucher - gigure & kaspi ( 2005 ) use a gaussian with a mean birth period @xmath97  s and a spread of 0.15  s. all these results contradict the view that all pulsars are born as fast rotators ( @xmath98  s ) which arises from observational selection effects , since young and fast neutron stars ( e.g. the crab pulsar ) would be more easily detectable as radio pulsars than the more slowly rotating ones .",
    "we note that with our model parameters , the pulsar birth spin period increases with increasing magnetic field , but is almost independent of the field in the range @xmath99 where the vast majority of isolated radio pulsars lie .",
    "the magnetic field dependence becomes important in the high - field radio pulsars and magnetar field range .",
    "the observations show that the field distribution is intrinsically asymmetric with a low field tail that is more prominent than the high field tail .",
    "this general behaviour is reproduced by our assumed bi - gaussian flux distribution .",
    "furthermore , the model predicts 26 pulsars with fields @xmath100 g , in good agreement with the pmbs which shows 23 stars in the same field range .",
    "there have been many previous attempts at synthesising the population of radio pulsars with different assumptions on neutron star magnetic fields , field decay and initial periods .",
    "some of these investigations have led to the conclusion that the neutron star field distribution can not be described by a single gaussian ( e.g. gonthier et al .",
    "2002 ) , and we find a similar result for the magnetic fluxes of their progenitor stars .    the initial - final mass radius relationship that we have assumed implies that higher mass progenitors will produce higher mass neutron stars .",
    "these stars will , on average , also have higher magnetic fluxes , and therefore tend to produce higher field neutron stars . however , the latter effect is counterbalanced by the strongly declining initial mass function which favours low mass star progenitors , which can also produce high field neutron stars in the gaussian tail of the magnetic flux distribution . in order to investigate the mass distribution of active radio pulsars in the galaxy with periods less than 20  s ,",
    "we have divided them into two field groups ( @xmath101 ) and ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "our results are shown in figure 3 for pulsars with 1374 mhz luminosities @xmath103 mjy  kpc@xmath1 .",
    "the mean neutron star masses in these groups are @xmath104 and @xmath6 respectively , whilst the mean masses of their progenitors are @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively .",
    "the stars in the highest field bin have a high mass tail with 54 percent of the stars extending beyond @xmath107 compared to 19 percent of stars in the same mass range in the lower field bin .",
    "we find that the total number of active pulsars with 1374 mhz luminosities @xmath108 mjy  kpc@xmath1 is 447,000 .",
    "if we apply the beaming model of equation [ beam ] , we find that the number of active pulsars whose beams intercept earth reduces to 48,000 .",
    "= 0.95    the magnetars are neutron stars that are discovered as x - ray and/or @xmath10-ray sources",
    ". they are currently confined to the period range @xmath109  s and are young objects ( e.g. gaensler et al .",
    "if one makes the standard assumption of dipole radiation with a braking index of 3 , the magnetic fields are in the range @xmath110 .",
    "we have used our calculations to investigate if the high field tail of the neutron stars in our model can provide an explanation for the numbers of magnetars that are seen in the galaxy .",
    "here we use as our cutoff @xmath111  g , since this value is just above the revised quantum critical field of zhang & harding ( 2000 ) for radio emission .",
    "if we isolate the total number of neutron stars with fields in excess of @xmath4  g , and ages of less than 500,000 years , we find 146 such stars , none of which would be detectable as radio - pulsars .",
    "if we now limit the age to 100,000 years , our modelling yields 24 magnetars in the galaxy with periods from @xmath112 to @xmath113  s and 8 magnetars with periods @xmath114  s , 5 of which have periods between 12 and 15 seconds .",
    "thus , the number declines rapidly with period outside the observed period range .",
    "we note in this context that some magnetars exhibit a large discrepancy between their real ages ( as determined through their association with supernova remnants ) and their characteristic ages ( e.g. axps 1e2259 + 586 and 1e1845 - 0545 , gaensler et al .",
    "this discrepancy is readily explained through our assumption of a @xmath115 relationship , which sees high field neutron stars being born preferentially at long periods ( @xmath116  s ) .",
    "below @xmath117  g , there is an area of overlap where a couple of magnetars have fields and periods that are comparable to those of the high field radio pulsars ( hbrps ) ( e.g. kaspi & mclaughlin 2005 ) .",
    "this suggests that there could exist lower field magnetars ( @xmath118  g ) that eventually evolve into x - ray silent hbrps of the type currently observed if their radio - beams intercept the earth .",
    "we note that it should also be possible to discover `` hybrid '' young objects with @xmath119  g exhibiting both magnetar and radio pulsar characteristics . in our analysis",
    ", we have counted all these objects as radio - pulsars if they pass through our pmbs filtering program .    finally , we return to the recent evidence for high progenitor masses in the magnetars 1e  1048 - 5937 ( gaensler et al .",
    "2005 ) and cxo  j164710.2 - 455216 ( muno et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in the dynamo model , rapid spin ( @xmath120  ms ) is required to generate super - strong fields and heger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argue that it is only the cores of the more massive stars that have this property .",
    "this has been used as an argument in favour of the dynamo model , at least for the magnetars .",
    "we note that these findings also support our fossil hypothesis , since we predict that magnetars , and more generally high field neutron stars , originate preferentially from high mass progenitors .",
    "we conclude by noting that the fossil field hypothesis as formulated by us , and which does not allow for magnetic flux loss in the post main - sequence evolution , requires a very specific distribution of magnetic fields for massive main sequence stars .",
    "this is shown in figure 4 for an assumed dipolar field structure .",
    "this distribution has a peak at @xmath2  g and low and high field wings extending from @xmath121  g to @xmath122  g with 8 percent of stars having fields in excess of @xmath123  g. the latter group are the progenitors of the highest field magnetars .",
    "the detailed shape of the main sequence distribution shown in figure 4 is potentially an observable quantity , and a prediction of our fossil field model .",
    "we thank natasa vranesevic and dick manchester for providing us with the codes necessary to compare our theoretical results with the observable sample of the pmbs pulsars .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of our manuscript and for numerous useful comments ."
