    "quasiperiodically driven mappings where the dynamics can be strange ( namely on fractal attractors ) but nonchaotic ( namely having a lack of sensitivity to initial conditions ) are of considerable current interest @xcite .",
    "strange nonchaotic attractors ( snas ) were first described by grebogi in 1984 @xcite , and are now known to be generic in quasiperiodically driven systems .",
    "such dynamics is paradoxical in some ways .",
    "the motion on snas is aperiodic , but over long times , nearby trajectories will coincide .",
    "the dynamics is almost always characterized by intermittency , which is indicative of the fact that such attractors are highly nonuniform and have a complicated interweaving of ( locally ) stable and unstable regions .",
    "external forcing allows for a additional means of probing nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "if the forcing is periodic , then the motion of the system becomes either periodic or chaotic , but for quasiperiodic forcing ( for example when a system is modulated with two frequencies which are incommensurate with each other ) snas become possible .",
    "strange nonchaotic dynamics usually occurs in the vicinity of strange chaotic behavior and periodic or quasiperiodic ( nonstrange , nonchaotic ) behavior . as a result",
    ", such systems can show transitions between dynamical states and bifurcation phenomena which are similar to those in analogous autonomous systems ( for example the several scenarios @xcite such as the period - doubling route to chaos , intermittency , attractor crises , ) as those that are distinct from the bifurcations of unforced systems @xcite .",
    "these have been extensively studied in a number of different contexts : questions of interest range from the mechanisms through which snas are created @xcite , how they may be characterized @xcite , experimental systems where these might occur @xcite , etc .    in this paper",
    "we examine the transitions between a number of different types of attractors in the quasiperiodically driven logistic map . in this prototypical driven system",
    ", the attractors can be strange and nonchaotic , in addition to being strange and chaotic or nonchaotic and regular ( torus attractors ) .",
    "studies of the driven logistic map have played an important role in the study of snas .",
    "kaneko @xcite first observed `` torus wrinkling '' in this system : this was eventually described as the fractalization route to snas @xcite .",
    "the creation of snas through the collision of stable period  doubled tori with their unstable parent torus was also first studied in this system @xcite .",
    "one great advantage in studying the driven logistic mapping ( even though it is somewhat difficult to obtain analytic results ) is that the undriven logistic map has been extensively studied over the past few decades .",
    "many of the features of the driven system find their parallels in the undriven system . at the same time , however , since the dynamics in the logistic map is generic of a wide class , the behaviour that can be simply studied in the driven logistic map is characteristic of most driven nonlinear systems .",
    "some scenarios through which snas are formed in this and related systems have been reviewed recently @xcite .",
    "snas occur in several different parameter ranges , between regions of periodic or torus attractors and regions of chaotic attractors .",
    "there is a plethora of possible dynamical transitions , some of which have parallels in the undriven system , such as torus bifurcations , @xmath0 and others which do not , such as transitions from tori to snas @xmath1 @xmath2 snas merge in a manner similar to the case of reverse bifurcations , snas widen , in a manner similar to widening chaotic crises , and can transform from one type to another or from snas to chaotic attractors .",
    "the main focus of this paper , in addition to characterizing the above bifurcations and transitions in this system through the lyapunov exponent and its fluctuations , is also to examine the manner in which the invariant measure varies with the parameters of the system , and the effect that this has on the dynamics . in many instances ,",
    "these bifurcations or transitions involve the lyapunov exponent going through zero , and can be analyzed in terms of symmetries in the tangent  space dynamics .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model , and discuss the analysis in terms of global and local lyapunov exponents , and the return map for stretch exponents .",
    "the the characteristic behavior of the lyapunov exponents at the various transitions to different attractors are discussed in sec .",
    "this is followed by a summary in sec .",
    "we study the logistic map with quasiperiodic modulation of the parameter @xmath3 , [ logistic ] x_n+1 & = & x_n ( 1 - x_n ) + _ n+1 & = & _ n + 1 , where @xmath4 is taken to be an irrational number ( usually the golden mean ratio , @xmath5",
    ". successive iterates of @xmath6 will densely and uniformly cover the unit interval in a quasiperiodic manner , and the system therefore has _ no _ periodic orbits . as in our previous studies",
    "@xcite , we rescale the parameter @xmath7 for convenience , and study the system in the range @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent corresponding to the @xmath6-rotation is trivially zero ; however the other exponent , which is of most importance in determining the dynamics varies with the parameters .",
    "it can be calculated by averaging the _ stretch exponents _ tangential to the flow , namely [ stretch ] y_n = ( 1 - 2 x_n ) , which is the local derivative of the mapping along a trajectory .",
    "the local or @xmath10step lyapunov exponent is [ nlyap ] _",
    "j=1^n y_j from which , asymptotically , one gets the global lyapunov exponent = _ n _ n. [ lyap ]    the stretch exponents are negative in the region bounded by the curves [ xtheta ] x _ ( ) = 12 . any change in the dynamics such that the invariant measure is increased in the region @xmath11 $ ] will therefore lead to a decrease in the lyapunov exponent , and , conversely , depletion of measure in this region will naturally lead to an increase in the lyapunov exponent .",
    "note , however , that the invariant measure , @xmath12 , for this mapping is not known exactly ( except at @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is therefore determined numerically by partitioning the phase space @xmath14 into bins and examining the itinerary of a long trajectory . shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) is an example of a sna ; the corresponding invariant measure is shown in fig .",
    "the solid line is the locus of @xmath15 , ( cf .",
    "( [ xtheta ] ) ) , showing that the sna is largely located within the contracting regions in phase space , but also has considerable support in the unstable regions .",
    "local les , @xmath16 , depend on initial conditions but ( with probability 1 ) @xmath17 does not @xcite . in order to characterize the non  uniformity of the attractor",
    ", it has proved instructive to examine the distribution of local lyapunov exponents . the probability density , p(n , ) d&= & probability   that   _",
    "n  lies   between   + & &   and   + d , has been seen to have characteristic limiting forms that depend on the nature of the attractor @xcite . of course , as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , but the nature of the finite  size corrections and the approach to the limit are distinctive for different dynamical states .",
    "this analysis is relevant for the study of nonuniform attractors , particularly for different attractors across crisis points or at intermittency , when stretched exponentials often occur @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the variation of the dynamics through several transitions in the system as the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath20 are varied .",
    "phase diagrams for this system in different parameter ranges have been obtained in a number of previous studies @xcite , and it is known that there are two distinct regions of chaotic dynamics , corresponding , respectively to high driving ( large @xmath20 ) and large nonlinearity ( large @xmath3 ) .",
    "these are shown in fig .  2 as c@xmath21 and c@xmath22 @xcite , and they separate a region of quasiperiodic ( torus ) dynamics .",
    "strange nonchaotic motion occurs on the boundaries of these regions @xcite as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in addition to the asymptotic nontrivial lyapunov exponent , we also examine the distribution of @xmath10step lyapunov exponents , and the variance of this distribution .    the variation in  with @xmath3  for fixed @xmath20 is shown in fig .",
    "although there are several bifurcations and transitions , these are not easily visible in the behavior of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "we therefore examine an approximate or partial bifurcation diagram which can be obtained for this system by plotting the values of @xmath23 that obtain within a narrow window in @xmath6 , namely in the interval ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this will depend upon the choice of @xmath25 and also on the particular value of @xmath6 chosen , but qualitative features of the bifurcation diagram are not affected .    the partial bifurcation diagram , fig .",
    "3(b ) , shows some of the transitions clearly : the torus  doubling , for instance , and the transition from torus attractors to fractal attractors . since singularities are dense in @xmath6 , a sna or a chaotic attractor shows up as a spread of points ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) , for example ) , while a torus attractor appears as a point or a finite set of points .",
    "the distinction between a chaotic attractor or a sna is not evident in the bifurcation diagram , but examining figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , and the change in the variance in , shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) gives a complete picture of the different attractors that are present in the system .",
    "( our calculations of the variance , @xmath26 , are from @xmath27 samples , each of total length @xmath28 iterations . )",
    "quasiperiodic forcing converts the fixed points of the logistic map into tori . at the period",
    " doubling bifurcation , the lyapunov exponent is exactly zero , as in the unforced system , but with quasiperiodicity , the sequence of torus ",
    "doublings is interrupted and leads to snas , either through the collision of stable and unstable tori as discussed by heagy and hammel @xcite , or through fractalization @xcite .",
    "this latter scenario is the most common route to sna , and since there is , apparently , no bifurcation involved , it is not clearly understood as to how a torus gets increasingly wrinkled and transforms into a fractal attractor in the process . other routes to sna are known , some of which , like intermittency @xcite , occur in this system and others , such as the blowout bifurcation route @xcite , which do not .      as has been remarked earlier ,",
    "several of the bifurcation phenomena of ( unforced ) chaotic dynamical systems find their parallels in quasiperiodically forced systems .",
    "for example , there are analogue of crisis phenomena . in the present system snas have a certain number of `` bands '' .",
    "@xmath29band snas are formed from @xmath29-tori via fractalization , or from 2@xmath29tori through the heagy ",
    "hammel mechanism .",
    "additionally , one  band snas can form from a 1torus @xcite or a 3torus @xcite due to saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "as parameters are further varied , snas themselves evolve and merge at quasiperiodic analogues of band  merging crises or reverse bifurcations : @xmath29band snas transform to @xmath30band snas .",
    "through such a transition , when the dynamics remains nonchaotic and strange ,   is a good order parameter .",
    "sosnovtseva  @xcite , who discovered an example of this transition in the driven hnon and circle maps , demonstrated the merging by examining the phase portrait .",
    "given the fairly narrow range over which snas exist in any system , such transitions also occurs in a restricted range , and often such crises can occur after the transition to chaotic attractors .",
    "however , the variation of  does not follow a uniform pattern as in the unforced case @xcite .",
    "snas which are formed via fractalization may merge at negative .",
    "the lyapunov exponent _ decreases _ with increasing nonlinearity ; shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) is the variation of  at a band  merging bifurcation ( shown by the arrow ) from a two  band sna to a one  band sna for @xmath31 .",
    "the critical value of the parameter is @xmath32 and the corresponding ` partial ' bifurcation diagram of each alternate iterate of @xmath23 is shown in fig .",
    "at merging crises in unforced systems , the lyapunov exponent usually does not show an increase ( unlike at widening crises ) while with forcing , the exponent actually decreases .",
    "this can be understood by examining the invariant density on the attractor before and after merging .",
    "the two bands of the two  band sna straddle the region of phase space bounded by the curves @xmath15 , eq .",
    "[ xtheta ] . after the merging transition",
    ", the density is enhanced mainly in this region where the stretch exponents are all negative .",
    "as a consequence , the lyapunov exponent _ must _ decrease .",
    "( a plot of the difference in the invariant density on the snas before and after merging is shown in fig .",
    "this appears to be the typical behaviour at the sna band  merging transition @xcite , and is in contrast to the behaviour of the unforced system .",
    "widening crises also occur , where the sna abruptly changes size as a parameter is varied ( near w@xmath22 in fig .  2 ) .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "5 is such an example , which occurs on the line @xmath33 . here ,",
    "crisis sna , shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) , is clearly larger than the pre ",
    "crisis sna ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) which is created via fractalization .",
    "the signatures of the transition are evident in both  and the variance [ figs .",
    "5(c - d ) ] .",
    "the sudden expansion of the attractor seems to be due to collision with the unstable saddle ( which also gives rise to the intermittency transition to sna @xcite ) .",
    "this saddle is difficult to locate , but in the three  dimensional extension of this system , namely the quasiperiodically driven hnon map , osinga and feudel have recently described similar crises in detail @xcite and have obtained the saddle there as well .",
    "in contrast to merging crises , the density is now enhanced in the unstable regions of phase space :  therefore increases .",
    "the distribution of finite  time les also has a stretched exponential tail which is characteristic of the crisis  induced intermittency @xcite [ see fig .",
    "similar interior crises also take place for lower forcing , when a fractalized sna transforms to an intermittent sna .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "6 , near @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( w@xmath21 in fig .",
    "2 ) , namely on the edge of region c@xmath21 .      on variation of a parameter",
    ", a sna can be transformed into a chaotic attractor if the largest lyapunov exponent becomes positive .",
    "this transition , which is also not associated with any bifurcation , is not as dramatic as from the torus to a sna .",
    "typically there is a smooth variation in the lyapunov exponent .    at the sna@xmath36 chaos transition ,",
    "all the lyapunov exponents of the system are zero .",
    "since   [ eq .  ( [ lyap ] ) ] is a global average , it is of interest to know how the individual terms in eq .",
    "( [ stretch ] ) cancel out so as to give a value zero . consider the partial finite sums @xcite , [ sum1 ] _ n^+ = 1 n_+ _",
    "i y_i ,   y_i > 0 , and [ sum2 ] _ n^- = 1 n_- _",
    "i y_i ,   y_i < 0 , namely the separate contributions to the local lyapunov exponent .",
    "these are obtained by partitioning a trajectory into @xmath37 points on expanding regions , where the stretch exponents are positive , and @xmath38 points on contracting regions where the stretch exponents are negative with @xmath39 .",
    "clearly @xmath40 , and with the limits _",
    "n _ n^ ^ ( cf",
    "( [ nlyap ] ) and ( [ lyap ] ) ) @xmath41 .",
    "if there are symmetries in the system @xcite , then @xmath42 and @xmath43 can equal each other and thereby yield @xmath44 . in such situations",
    ", there is a term  by  term cancelation of positive and negative stretch exponents @xcite . at torus bifurcations , for instance , or at the blowout bifurcation transition",
    "to snas @xcite this situation applies .    on the other hand , there can be an `` accidental '' equality , namely , since both @xmath42 and @xmath43 will be functions of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath45 , it may happen that they are both equal in magnitude for some choice of parameters , and thereby lead to a zero value for the lyapunov exponent .    at the sna to chaos transition , this latter situation obtains .",
    "lai @xcite investigated the transition from snas to chaotic attractors and found that this transition occurs only when the contraction and expansion rates for infinitesimal vectors along a typical trajectory on the attractor ( namely @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) become equal ; the le passes through zero _ linearly _ as in fig .",
    "there are , however , subtler effects that become apparent when examining fluctuations in the local lyapunov exponents .",
    "the variance of the distribution shows a small increase across the transition [ fig .",
    "there is an increase in the fluctuations in the transition from torus attractors to sna as well ( from essentially zero to some finite value ) . at the sna to chaos transition ,",
    "the scale of fluctuations doubles , and is therefore noticeable on this scale .",
    "the sna @xmath46 chaotic attractor transition is not accompanied by any major change in the form or shape of the attractor , and the lyapunov exponent itself changes only from being negative to positive . yet",
    "the fluctuations on the chaotic attractor are always larger than those on the nonchaotic attractor .",
    "this enhancement in fluctuations in   can be analyzed via the invariant density on the attractors . shown in fig .",
    "8 is the _ difference _ in the invariant density on a sna and a chaotic attractor symmetrically placed about the sna @xmath46 chaos transition . while it is clear that the morphology of the attractor does not change significantly , it can also be seen that on the sna , the invariant density is enhanced in the regions where stretch exponents are mainly negative . since these span the range from @xmath47 to 0 within the region",
    "@xmath11 $ ] , they contribute significantly to the variance without greatly affecting the mean : the lyapunov exponent , thus , does not change significantly , but the fluctuations show an increase .",
    "crises which occur _ after _ the transition to chaos appear to be very similar to analogous phenomena in systems without forcing @xcite ; @xmath17 has a power ",
    "law dependence on the parameter , @xmath48 .",
    "for example the widening crisis due to saddle node bifurcation along @xmath49 , across the transition point @xmath50 is observed where the value of @xmath51 is @xmath52 which is larger than the unforced case @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have studied different dynamical transitions that occur in the quasiperiodically driven logistic map , the main focus being on the quasiperiodic analogues of crisis phenomena .",
    "snas are formed via several different routes , and coexist with chaotic as well as other nonchaotic attractors . as a result",
    "there are interesting transformations of one type of attractor to another .",
    "the torus to sna transitions have been extensively described previously @xcite .",
    "fractalization , which is the most common scenario for the formation of snas is a `` p2c2e '' @xcite : no explicit bifurcation mechanism has been identified with this route .",
    "however , fractalized snas can be transformed into intermittent snas upon collision with an unstable torus in an analogue of the interior crisis , and also undergo merging at the analogue of a merging crisis .    in all these transitions ,",
    "the nontrivial lyapunov exponent is a good order ",
    "parameter , and furthermore , its fluctuations the distributions of finite  time exponents provide additional signatures for these transitions . in order to understand the nature of the variations of these quantities",
    ", however , it is necessary to study the the invariant measure on snas .",
    "we show that they have support even in regions which are locally unstable .    at many of the transitions that involve such attractors",
    ", there is no particular change in form or morphology .",
    "however , by examining differences in the invariant density at different parameter values , it becomes clear that at these transitions , the manner in which the dynamics explores the attractor can change drastically , and small changes in the density can lead to significant effects in the fluctuation properties of such attractors .",
    "typical attractors in dynamical systems are nonuniform , both with respect to the natural invariant measure as well as in the rate at which nearby trajectories  locally  diverge or converge .",
    "if the measure on converging regions exceeds that on the diverging regions , then the attractor is asymptotically nonchaotic and will be characterized by a negative lyapunov exponent .",
    "external modulation can be one method of altering the invariant measure , and this method of creating nonchaotic dynamics @xcite therefore provides a new means of synchronization and control . in this context , therefore , studies of the bifurcations and transformations of snas give further insights into the interplay between global stability and local instability .",
