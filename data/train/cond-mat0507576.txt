    "the need to analyze markov processes described by a master equation arises frequently in physics and related fields @xcite .",
    "since such equations do not in general admit an exact solution , approximation methods are of interest .",
    "a widely applied approximation scheme is van kampen s ` @xmath0-expansion ' , which furnishes corrections to the ( deterministic ) mean - field or macroscopic description in the limit of large effective system size @xcite .",
    "another approximation method , based on a path - integral representation for birth - and - death type processes , was proposed by peliti @xcite .",
    "this approach was recently reviewed and extended @xcite , and applied to derive a series expansion for the activity in a stochastic sandpile @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that while effectively exact results can be obtained via numerical analysis of the master equation , the calculations become extremely cumbersome for large populations or multivariate processes",
    ". a further limitation of numerical analyses is that they do not furnish algebraic expressions that may be required in theoretical developments . for these reasons it is highly desirable to study approximation methods for stochastic processes .    in the present work",
    "we apply the path - integral based perturbation approach to a simpler problem , namely , the malthus - verhulst process ( mvp ) , a birth - and - death process in which unlimited population growth is prevented by a saturation effect .",
    "( the death rate per individual grows linearly with population size . )",
    "this is an important , though highly simplified model in population dynamics .",
    "although the master equation for this process is readily solved numerically , the model serves as a useful testing ground for approximation methods . a lattice of coupled mvps exhibits ( in the infinite - size limit ) a phase transition belonging to the directed percolation universality class .    in the perturbation approach developed here @xcite , moments of the population size @xmath3",
    "are expressed as functional integrals over a pair of functions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , involving an effective action .",
    "the latter , obtained from an exact mapping of the original markov process , generally includes a part that is bilinear in the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , whose moments can be determined exactly , and ` interaction ' terms of higher order , that are treated in an approximate manner . in the present approach ,",
    "the interaction terms are analyzed in a perturbative fashion , leading to a diagrammatic series . with",
    "increasing order , the number of diagrams grows explosively , so that it becomes convenient to devise a computational algorithm for their enumeration and evaluation .",
    "elaboration of such an algorithm does not , however , require any very sophisticated techniques , and could in fact be applied to a variety of problems .",
    "this is the approach that was applied to the stochastic sandpile in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the evaluation of diagrams involves calculating multidimensional wave - vector integrals .",
    "the present example is free of this complication , allowing us to derive a slightly longer series than for the sandpile .    in this work we focus on stationary moments of the mvp .",
    "the series expressions are apparently divergent , but nevertheless provide nearly perfect predictions away from the small - population regime , as compared with direct numerical evaluation of _ quasi_-stationary properties .",
    "one might suppose that the divergent nature of the perturbation series is due to the mvp not possessing a true stationary state .",
    "( the process must eventually become trapped in the absorbing state , although the lifetime grows exponentially with the mean population @xcite . ) applying our method to the mvp with a steady input , which does possess a stationary state , we find however that the perturbation series continues to be divergent , although again providing excellent predictions over most of parameter space .    in the following section we define the malthus - verhlst process ,",
