    "it is convincing that cold dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) are two dominant sources governing the evolution of our universe . considering that these two components are",
    "independent is a very specific assumption , in the framework of field theory it is more natural to consider the inevitable interaction between them @xcite .",
    "an appropriate interaction in the dark sectors can alleviate the coincidence problem and understand why energy densities of dark sectors are of the same order of magnitude today @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , it was suspected that the coupling between dark sectors might lead to the curvature perturbation instability @xcite .",
    "this problem was later clarified in @xcite where it was shown that the stability of curvature perturbation holds by appropriately choosing the forms of the interaction and the values of the constant equation of state ( eos ) of the de .",
    "another possibility to cure the instability was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the observational signature of the interaction between dark sectors has been widely discussed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was found that the coupling in dark sectors can affect significantly the expansion history of the universe and the growth history of cosmological structures .",
    "a number of studies have been devoted to grasp the signature of the dark sectors mutual interaction from the probes of the cosmic expansion history by using the wmap , snia , bao and sdss data etc @xcite-@xcite .",
    "interestingly it was disclosed that the late isw effect has the unique ability to provide insight into the coupling between dark sectors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , complementary probes of the coupling within dark sectors have been carried out in the study of the growth of cosmic structure @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was found that a non - zero interaction between dark sectors leaves a clear change in the growth index @xcite . in addition",
    ", it was argued that the dynamical equilibrium of collapsed structures such as clusters would acquire a modification due to the coupling between de and dm @xcite , which could leave the signature in the virial masses of clusters @xcite .",
    "the imprint of dark sectors interaction in the cluster number counts was disclosed in @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations of structure formation in the context of interacting de models were studied in @xcite .",
    "since both de and dm are currently only detected via their gravitational effects and any change in the de density is conventionally attributed to its equation of state @xmath0 , there is an inevitable degeneracy while extracting the signature of the interaction between dark sectors and other cosmological parameters .",
    "the degeneracies among the dark sector coupling , the the equation of state ( eos ) of de and the dm abundance were first discussed in @xcite . in the formalism of the perturbation theory , it was found that the degeneracy can be broken and tighter constraint on the interaction between dark sectors can be obtained from observations .    in @xcite ,",
    "the eos of de was taken to be constant .",
    "recently , more accurate data analysis tells us that the time varying de gives a better fit than a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the time varying eos influences a lot on the universe evolution , perturbation stability and it must affect the constraint on the interaction between dark sectors . thus it is of great interest to generalize the discussion in @xcite to the interacting de model with time - dependent de eos . the observational constraints on an interacting de with time varying eos were discussed in @xcite .",
    "in this work we will first discuss the stability of the perturbation and the degeneracy between the dark sector interaction and the time varying eos of de .",
    "furthermore we will explore possible ways to break the degeneracy among the dark sectors coupling , the time - dependent de eos and the dm abundance . in our study",
    "we will use the popular chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite to describe the time varying de eos , which expresses the eos in terms of the scale factor in the form @xmath1 . in the early time ,",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath3 . at the present time",
    "when @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "in the spatially flat friedmann - robertson- walker(frw ) background , if there is an interaction between de and dm , neither of them can evolve independently .",
    "the ( non)conservation equations are described by @xmath6 where the subscript c represents dm and d stands for de .",
    "@xmath7 is the term leading to energy transfer .",
    "considering that there is only energy transfer between de and dm , we have @xmath8 .",
    "the sign of @xmath9 determines the direction of the energy transfer . for positive @xmath9 ,",
    "the energy flows from de to dm . for negative @xmath9",
    ", the energy flow is reversed . in our following study",
    ", we adopt the phenomenological interaction in the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the coupling constant .",
    "this merely repeats the analysis of [ 10 ] , where the energy transfer was assumed to be proportional to the energy density , but here we have the energy density times the hubble parameter . in [ 7 ] , it was indicated that qualitatively similar conclusions apply to both cases .",
    "the presence of dm energy density in the interaction was shown problematic in the stability of perturbation @xcite .",
    "it was argued that only for constant eos of de in the phantom region , this interaction form can be viable and effective to alleviate the coincidence problem@xcite .",
    "it is of interest to explore this interaction form when the de eos is time - dependent with the cpl parametrization , especially when the de eos is in the quintessence region .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the coupling vector is specified in co - moving frame as @xmath12 the perturbed form of the zero component @xmath13 can be uniquely determined from the background energy - momentum transfer and has the form @xmath14 while the spatial component of the perturbed energy - momentum transfer @xmath15 can be set to zero since there is no non - gravitational interaction in the de and dm coupled system and only the inertial drag effect appears in the system due to the stationary energy transfer between de and dm as discussed in @xcite .    the perturbation equations for dm and de have the forms @xcite @xmath16 @xmath17 is the ratio of dm to de . in the above , @xmath18 .",
    "however , it is not clear what expression we should have for @xmath19 . in @xcite",
    "it has been argued in favor of @xmath20 .",
    "this is correct for the scalar field , but it is not obvious for other cases . the most dangerous possibility , as far as instabilities are concerned , is @xmath21 since the first term in the second line of the equation of @xmath22 can lead to the blow up when @xmath0 is close to @xmath23 .",
    "assuming that @xmath24 , the last two equations above for de can be rewritten as @xmath25 numerically , we find that the first two terms on the rhs of the perturbation equations for de contribute more than other terms to the divergence . in order to explain the reason for the blow - up , we keep the leading terms and use @xmath26 in the early universe @xcite . in the early universe @xmath27 and",
    "the above equations can be reduced in the form @xmath28 the second order differential equation for @xmath29 can be written as @xmath30 in the radiation dominated period , we have @xmath31 , thus @xmath32 which gives the solution @xmath33 where @xmath34    when @xmath35 is a real positive value , the perturbation will blow up . in @xcite for the constant de eos , @xmath0 was required to be smaller than @xmath23 to accommodate the stability . for the de eos with cpl parametrization , in the early time @xmath36 can also allow negative @xmath35 to provide stability .",
    "moreover as shown in fig.[w_index ] when @xmath37 in the early time , the stability can be safely protected as well .    .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 meet at the point where the square root becomes zero .",
    "the real part of @xmath40 are the same on the right side of this point . ]    when @xmath41 , the above approximate analytical analysis can not help , we need to count on the numerical calculation to see the stability of perturbation in the early universe .",
    "results are shown in fig.[pert ] .",
    "when @xmath42 falls in this range , the perturbation grows slower for weaker coupling .",
    "when the existing dark sector coupling is weak enough , it has the possibility to keep the perturbation stable . for smaller @xmath42 in the range @xmath41 , weaker interaction",
    "is required to keep the stability in perturbation .     +    thus unlike the constant de with @xmath43 , the time varying de can allow stable perturbation when it is interacting with dm . however in some ranges of @xmath0 in the quintessence region , in order to keep the stability in the perturbation we have the upper limit on the strength of the interaction .",
    "when the de eos is in the phantom region , the stability of the perturbation is always protected in the presence of the interaction between dark sectors , which is the same as the case we observed for the constant eos of de @xcite .",
    "with the perturbation formalism at hand , we can study the influence of the interaction between dark sectors and other cosmological parameters on the cmb power spectrum .",
    "we will concentrate our attention on the de eos in the quintessence region @xmath43 , since it has different property as discussed in the above section compared with the case with constant eos . in fig.[deg ] we illustrate the theoretical computation results of the cmb power spectrum for changing @xmath44 in the cpl parametrization of de eos and coupling constant @xmath11 but with dm abundance fixed .",
    "+    we see in the cmb tt angular power spectrum that the change of the @xmath42 only modifies the acoustic peaks , while it does not influence the low - l part of the spectrum .",
    "the influence of @xmath45 is on the contrary , it changes little of the acoustic peaks , but influences more on the small - l spectrum .",
    "when @xmath45 decreases , low - l spectrum will be suppressed .",
    "different effects given by @xmath42 and @xmath45 on cmb spectrum are interesting .",
    "since we have more cmb data in large - l than small - l spectrum , it is easier to constrain @xmath42 than @xmath45 .",
    "this can be used to explain the fitting results in the following .",
    "the above discussion is for the fixed coupling constant .",
    "if we allow the change of @xmath11 , we see that at the acoustic peaks , @xmath11 plays more important role in the change of the spectrum than the influence of @xmath42 . in the low - l region",
    ", we also observe that @xmath11 effect is more important than @xmath45 to suppress the cmb spectrum .",
    "the above discussion is valid for fixed dm abundance .",
    "now we investigate the dependence of cmb angular power spectrum on the abundance of matter , @xmath46 . since the abundance of baryon is fixed , it is identical to investigate the effect of the abundance of cdm .",
    "although the abundance of the dm does not affect much on the low - l cmb power spectrum , it quite influences the amplitude of the first and second acoustic peaks in cmb tt angular power spectrum ( see fig.[deg2 ] ) .",
    "decreasing @xmath47 will enhance the acoustic peaks .",
    "this effect is degenerated with the influence given by the dark sectors interaction and @xmath42 as we observed in fig.[deg ] .",
    "a possible way to break this degeneracy is to consider the influence of the interaction on the low - l cmb spectrum .",
    "moreover , we can include further observations to get a complementary constraint on the matter abundance and this in turn can help to constrain the coupling between dark sectors .        in order to extract the signature of the interaction and put constraints on other cosmological parameters ,",
    "we need to use the latest cmb data together with other observational data .",
    "we report the results of fitting in the next section .",
    "in this section we confront our models with observational data by implementing joint likelihood analysis .",
    "we take the parameter space as @xmath48,n_s,\\xi , w_0 , w_e)\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the hubble constant , @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the amplitude of the primordial curvature perturbation , @xmath52 is the scalar spectral index , @xmath11 is the coupling constant when we choose the interaction in proportion to the energy density of dm . to avoid the negative energy density of de in the early time of the universe@xcite , we limit the coupling constant @xmath11 to be positive which indicates the energy flow from de to dm .",
    "@xmath44 are parameters in the cpl parametrization of de eos . since we concentrate on the de eos in the quintessence region , we set the limit @xmath53 in our data fitting .",
    "we choose the flat universe with @xmath54 and our work is based on cmbeasy code@xcite .",
    "the fitting results are listed in table.[bestfit ] .",
    "when we only use the cmb anisotropy data from the seven - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , in fig.[1dlike ] we show the 1d marginalized likelihoods for all of the primary mcmc parameters of our model .",
    "it is clear that , just from cmb data , the constraint on @xmath45 is worse than that on @xmath42 .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis we did in the theoretical study .",
    "the @xmath42 affects more on the acoustic peaks .",
    "more observational cmb data there can help to constrain @xmath42 well . for our model with the interaction between dark sectors in proportion to the energy density of dm",
    ", we find that cmb data alone can impose tight constraints on couplings and @xmath55 .",
    "this can be understood by using our theoretical analysis that the degeneracy between the coupling and the dm abundance can be broken by looking at the low - l cmb spectrum .",
