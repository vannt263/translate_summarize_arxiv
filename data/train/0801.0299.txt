    "the role of the range of interactions in phase transitions and critical phenomena has been investigated for many years .",
    "for example , there are rigorous theorems which rule out the possibility of long - range ordered phases of a system with only short - range interactions merwag .",
    "it is also well known that mean - field theory becomes exact in the limit of infinite range interactions stanley .",
    "power - law interactions , which fall as @xmath0 with the increasing separation @xmath1 between the interacting elements , can smoothly interpolate between these two extremes anderson70,fisher71 .",
    "the implications of power - law interactions have been explored for several physical systems ; these include , for example , classical kotliar83 and quantum spin glasses dutta02 , ionic systems pitzer85 , complex networks watts98 , etc .",
    "very recently , non - equilibrium phase transitions with long - range interactions have also received attention hinrichsen07 .",
    "power - law interactions can lead to non - trivial and counterintuitive results .",
    "for example , for the @xmath5-dimensional ising model with ferromagnetic power - law interactions , the critical exponents depend on the range parameter @xmath6 and the conventional short - range critical exponents are recovered for relatively large @xmath6 ( typically for @xmath7 ) fisher71 , jenssen97 .",
    "the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition in a @xmath5-dimensional ising model with inverse - square interaction @xmath8 is a special type of kosterlitz - thouless transition kosterlitz driven by topological defects kosterlitz76 .    for many systems , heuristic reasoning , which are essentially extensions of peierls original arguments peierls ,",
    "have been remarkably successful in predicting the ( im-)possibility of long - range order .",
    "some of these results were later established using rigorous analytical and numerical methods .",
    "examples include predicitions of the lower - critical dimension of the ising model and the impossibility of the existence of a two - dimensional crystaline order at a finite temperature .    in this work , employing peierls-type arguments",
    ", we examine the stability of long - range crystalline order in a d - dimensional system with power - law interactions . in other words ,",
    "we consider a crystal at a finite temperature where the atomic oscillators interact via a harmonic potential with a strength that decays algebraically , i.e. , as @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the seperation between the oscillators .",
    "it is to be noted that , the power - law form of interaction does not have an inherent length scale associated with it .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case where the strength of the interaction between two oscillators separated by a distance @xmath1 decays exponentially as @xmath9",
    ". clearly , in the latter case , @xmath10 sets in a length scale over which the interactions are effective and therefore the melting behaviour turns out to be identical to oscillators with only nearest neighbour interactions .    the peierls argument generalised to the power - law interactions suggests that the crystalline order persists for a one - dimensional solid even at a finite temperature , provided the range parameter @xmath2 whereas for @xmath11 the crystalline order is destroyed by infinitesimal thermal fluctuations .",
    "the case @xmath12 corresponds to a marginal situation .",
    "we also comment on the stability of the crystalline structure at zero - temperature when the oscillators are quantum mechanical so that quantum fluctuations tend to destroy the crystalline order .",
    "let us consider a one dimensional crystalline arrangement of harmonic oscillators with long - range interactions in the absence of any thermal or quantum fluctuations .",
    "the potential energy for this system(fig.[crystals ] ) in the harmonic approximation can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath13a)]^{2 } \\label{lrpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the effective spring constant , @xmath15 is the interatomic seperation and @xmath16 is the index representing the discrete sites on the crystal .",
    "the equation of motion for the atom at the position @xmath17 is given by @xmath18a)+q([n - m]a)-2q(na ) ] , \\label{eqnlr}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the mass of an oscillator .",
    "we assume the usual plane wave solutions of the type @xmath20 , to obtain the dispersion relation of the many - oscillator system given as @xmath21 in the long wavelength limit , i.e. @xmath22@xmath230 , which is relevant in determining the phase transition behaviour , eqn.([displr ] ) reduces to , @xmath24 provided @xmath25 converges . now",
    "in the special case of nearest neighbour short range interactions , we recover the standard phononic kittel dispersion relation , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the speed of sound . in the case of long range interactions , on the other hand",
    ", the interaction strength decays with distance as @xmath28 ( @xmath290 ) , then @xmath30 holds for @xmath31 since the sum in eqn.([displrn ] ) converges . for @xmath32 ,",
    "we get ( see appendix i ) @xmath33 it can be shown that the above dispersion relation holds for higher dimensional cases .",
    "we shall restrict our discussion to the range @xmath34 to estimate the marginal dimension or the range of the stability of a crystalline structure .",
    "we shall now examine the effect of thermal fluctuations on the stability of the above solid using the formalism developed by peierls @xcite . in the real space",
    ", the displacement of the atom at the position @xmath17 can be written as a superposition of the different fourier modes as , @xmath35 @xmath36 , where the time dependence has been ignored . making use of the classical equipartition theorem",
    ", we get @xmath37 the real space displacement , @xmath38 is immediately found to be , @xmath39 where @xmath5 denotes the dimensionality of space .",
    "then @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43=@xmath40q@xmath42@xmath44@xmath43 gives a measure of the fluctuation in the position of the atom at @xmath17 . to probe the marginality in the melting behaviour , we shall focus on the fluctuations in the displacement of the atom at the origin ( @xmath45=0 ) .",
    "let us first enlist the form of @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 for solids with short range interactions in different spatial dimensions @xmath46 from the above eqn.([del2sr ] ) , we see that @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 diverges for a one and two dimensional solid in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , the 2-d solid shows a @xmath48 divergence , which means that the divergence is extremely slow .",
    "this log - divergence immediately establishes the spatial dimension @xmath49 as the marginal dimension . for @xmath50 , on the other hand",
    ", @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 is finite in the limit @xmath47 , pointing to the existence of the crystalline order even at a finite temperature in a three - dimensional solid .",
    "let us now extend the above analysis to solids with long range interactions .",
    "the form of the fluctation @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 is enlisted below : @xmath51 the case with @xmath52 turns out to be the most interesting as we observe that for all values @xmath53 , the crystal remains stable even at a finite temperature . at @xmath54 ,",
    "we observe the first signature of a divergence .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath12 happens to be the marginal case , with fluctuations diverging logarithmically with the system size .",
    "this settles @xmath54 as the marginal case for a one - dimensional solid .",
    "if the long range interaction decays faster than @xmath55 , the interaction is feeble and the solid fails to retain the crystal structure even at an infinitesimally small temperature .",
    "in eqn.([realamp1 ] ) , if we put temperature @xmath4 , the average fluctuation @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 vanishes .",
    "we now have to take care of the quantum fluctuations if the harmonic oscillators are quantum mechanical . in that case",
    ", we should now set the average energy of a mode to be the zero - point energy @xmath56 of the corresponding oscillator .",
    "we obtain @xmath57 the above relations lead to a non - trivial modification in the marginal dimension of a solid with quantum mechanical oscillators , as illustrated below . in a spirit similar to that of the previous section ,",
    "let us now examine the @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 for a quantum solid with short range interactions , @xmath58 interestingly , under the effect of quantum fluctuations , both two and three dimensional crystals sustain the long range crystalline order , whereas the one dimensional solid shows a logarithmic divergence in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "hence in the case of quantum oscillators at @xmath4 , @xmath52 is the marginal dimension whereas in higher dimensions a perfect crystalline order exists at absolute zero .",
    "the above finding when contrasted with the melting behaviour of a classical solid with short - range interacting oscillators , an interesting @xmath59 correspondence , with respect to the marginal dimensionality arises .",
    "let us now assume that the quantum oscillators are also long - range interacting as the classical oscillators of the previous section .",
    "a similar line of arguments leads to @xmath60 it is obvious from the above expressions that the question of any instability does not arise even in @xmath52 if @xmath61 .",
    "therefore a one dimensional long - range quantum solid retains the crystalline order for a finite strength of quantum fluctuations , if the decay of the long - range interactions with the distance between the oscillators is sufficently slow .",
    "when @xmath62 , @xmath63 which corresponds to the first sign of a divergence as @xmath64 , and hence the situation is inferred to be marginal .",
    "the strength of the divergence keeps increasing till @xmath65 , when the @xmath40@xmath41@xmath66@xmath43@xmath67@xmath68 .",
    "we have summarised the different stability criteria obtained till now in table i.     spatial&classical&quantum&classical&quantum + dimension & ( t@xmath690)&(t=0)&(t@xmath690)&(t=0 ) + d=1&unstable&unstable&stable(1@xmath70@xmath6@xmath702)&stable(1@xmath70@xmath6@xmath703 ) + & & ( @xmath71 ) & unstable(@xmath6@xmath722)&unstable(@xmath71 ) + & & & & for ( @xmath6@xmath733 ) + d=2&unstable & stable&stable(1@xmath70@xmath6@xmath703)&stable + & ( @xmath74)&&unstable(@xmath71 ) & + & & & for @xmath6@xmath733 & + d=3&stable&stable&stable&stable +   +    [ table2 ]",
    "in this work , we have analyzed the stability of classical and quantum solids using peierls argument , with a special emphasis on the one dimensional situation .",
    "we just note in the passing that mercury chain salts , in which mercury is intercalated into linear chains in @xmath75 to give a compound @xmath76 ( @xmath770.18 at 300k ) , is a system that closely resembles a one dimensional solid @xcite .    in the presence of short range interactions",
    ", we never expect the 1-d solid to exist at any finite temperature ( eqn.[del2sr ] ) .",
    "an infinitesimal thermal disturbance is sufficient to destroy long range order .",
    "the existence of long range interactions among the atomic oscillators , where the interaction strength falls off with distance as @xmath0 with @xmath2 , has a non - trivial effect on the stability of the one - dimensional crystal . using a variant of peierls argument",
    ", we have shown that even a one - dimensional solid can sustain the crystalline order at a finite temperature if the range - parameter @xmath6 is sufficiently small ( @xmath2 ) . for @xmath12",
    ", @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 shows a logarithmic divergence and hence this is the marginal case of stability .",
    "this is similar to what is observed also in the case of a ferromagnetic power - law interacting ising model @xcite.that the inverse - square interaction is the marginal dimension even for melting of a long - range solid is an interesting observation .",
    "it should be mentioned that the situation @xmath54 turns out to be a marginal situation in various other long range interacting systems , for example in fracture models with variable range interactions herrman or in networks with long range links moukarzel .",
    "we have also explored the marginal dimension in the case where the oscillators are quantum mechanical . using a generalised version of peierls argument extended to the quantum case , which to our knowledge is new , we observe an interesting @xmath78 correspondence ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "a two - dimensional short - range classical solid is marginally stable against thermal fluctuations whereas a one - dimensional short range quantum solid happens to be marginally stable against quantum fluctuations at @xmath4 .",
    "this reminds us of the well known correspondence between the critical behaviour of a @xmath5-dimensional quantum ising model and @xmath79-dimensional classical ising model sachdev .",
    "however , at an infinitesimally small temperature a one - dimensional quantum solid can not retain a long - range order , which means that the quantum effects are irrelevant at a finite temperature as the zero - point energy is vanishingly small compared to the thermal energy @xmath80 .",
    "a unique correspondence emerges out of our study .",
    "we have shown that for a long - range one - dimensional classical solid , @xmath54 is the marginal range of interaction . in the corresponding quantum case , @xmath81 turns out to be the marginal case .",
    "there seems to exist a quantum - classical correspondence in the marginal range ofinteraction , just as in the case of dimension .",
    "one may also wonder about the existence of a tunable parameter in a quantum solid which may be varied to change the strength of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "eqn.([equic ] ) , suggests that the mass of the atomic oscillator is an appropriate candidate for the above as the more massive the atom , the less are the fluctuations or uncertainty in its position .",
    "we should conclude with the comment that in deriving the marginal dimensions or ranges in above mentioned solids , we have used the peierls argument and its generalisation to the quantum case .",
    "although , peierls argument is fairly successful in predicting the marginal dimension or range in several other situations , it fails to throw any light on the transition temperature ( for dimensions above the marginal dimension ) , nature of transitions or role of defects in the transition .",
    "however as we have shown , it predicts interesting results even in the case of melting of classical and quantum solids .",
