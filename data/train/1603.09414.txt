    "two longstanding classifications of integrable discrete systems in different dimensions , one by adler - bobenko - suris ( abs ) @xcite and the other by sakai @xcite , have been widely studied , but the mathematical connection between them remains incomplete . how to reduce the abs partial difference equations to sakai s discrete painlev equations is a natural question that has inspired many authors @xcite .",
    "however , these earlier approaches focused on taking periodic constraints in two dimensions that lead to equations with a restricted set of parameters , manually extending these by adding gauge transformations in order to introduce more parameters . another rich vein of inquiry reduces the lax pairs of abs equations to provide these elusive linear problems for discrete painlev equations .",
    "we provide a different approach grounded in higher - dimensional geometry associated naturally with full - parameter discrete painlev equations@xcite . in this paper , we review our approach and illustrate it for @xmath1-surface type @xmath2-discrete painlev equations , providing new lax pairs for these equations .",
    "the geometric setting of reflection groups is essential to our approach . within this framework ,",
    "we construct higher dimensional lattices , called @xmath3-lattices , from discrete painlev equations . these lattices also arise from integer lattices associated with abs classification and thereby provide a bridge between the two classifications . in an earlier series of papers @xcite , we constructed @xmath3-lattices for @xmath4- and @xmath5- surface @xmath2-painlev equations .",
    "the @xmath1-case is a simpler ( less degenerate ) surface than these earlier cases , but it is well known that when the surface is simpler , the corresponding symmetry groups and discrete painlev equations become more complex@xcite .    despite the increasing complexity , our approach connects discrete painlev equations to partial difference equations through reductions of hypercubes and polytopes .",
    "we construct two lattices in two ways , one through reduction of polytopes and the other by reduction of hypercubes .",
    "both lattices arise from the @xmath0 functions of @xmath1-surface type @xmath2-discrete painlev equation .",
    "they share fundamental variables ( called @xmath3-variables ) and both give rise to abs equations and to @xmath2-discrete painlev equations .",
    "the polytope case will be investigated further in future work .",
    "the hypercube lattice is referred to below as @xmath6 .",
    "( more details are given in ",

    "a fundamental property of the abs equations is their consistency around each cube of the integer lattice .",
    "the reduced hypercube structure of the lattice @xmath6 then provides us with reductions of the lax pairs of abs squations , which turn out to be new lax pairs for @xmath2-painlev equations .",
    "our results show that these equations share one monodromy problem .",
    "moreover , the coefficient matrices in each case are factorized into product of matrices that are linear in the monodromy variable @xmath7 .",
    "we remark that in each case , we also obtain lax pairs for the scalar form of the equations .    in this paper",
