    "topological materials classified by unconventional parity eigenvalues of three - dimensional ( bulk ) bands is one of the topics of high interest in solid state physics in this decade .",
    "the insulators classified in the non - trivial ( topological ) group are called topological insulators ( tis ) , and hold metallic and spin - polarized surface states that continuously disperse between the bulk valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum @xcite . because these topological surface states are spin - polarized and robust against any perturbations that do not change the parities of the entire bulk band structure , these states are regarded as a promising element for future spintronic devices @xcite .    in the early stages of ti research ,",
    "first - principles calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) achieved great success in predicting the topology of many materials and in proposing new ti candidates @xcite .",
    "most of these predictions were soon proven experimentally and there was excellent agreement between the predicted topological surface states and the observations @xcite . however , despite these great successes , there remains an open question on the topological order of the very simple material of single - crystal bi .",
    "bismuth is widely used as a component of tis , such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 @xcite and tlbise@xmath0 @xcite , because it is the heaviest non - radioactive element that also possesses a strong spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "this is critical because the soi plays an important role to realize the unconventional parity eigenvalues .",
    "the topological order of single - crystal bi has also been extensively studied together with its relative alloy bi@xmath2sb@xmath3 , which is the first material experimentally detected as three - dimensional ti @xcite . according to the dft @xcite as well as empirical tight - binding ( tb )",
    "@xcite calculations , the topological order of bi is trivial , and alloying with sb causes the topological phase transition to a ti to occur at @xmath4 0.04 .",
    "however , unlike most of the other cases , this prediction is not consistent with the experimental results .    figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) show the experimental surface - band dispersion of bi(111 ) obtained by angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite . in these dispersions , the two spin - split surface bands @xmath5 and @xmath6 merge into the same projected bulk valence bands ( bvbs ) at @xmath7 .",
    "however , at @xmath8 , these spin - split surface bands separately merge into two different projected bulk bands , with @xmath5 merging into the bulk conduction band ( bcb ) , while @xmath6 merges into the bvb .",
    "the overall dispersion is also schematically depicted in fig .",
    "1(d ) . based on this surface - state dispersion",
    ", @xmath5 continuously connects the projected bvb and bcb between two time - reversal - invariant momenta ( trim ) , which is the behavior that is expected for topologically non - trivial materials .",
    "indeed , a recent arpes report on bi@xmath9sb@xmath3 ( @xmath10 0.1 ) has demonstrated an almost identical surface - state dispersion @xcite , with the sole difference being that the projected bcb is above the fermi level at @xmath8 in bi@xmath9sb@xmath3 .",
    "it should be noted that the topological classification of the band structure is not only valid for semiconductors , but also for semimetals whose finite projected bulk band gap opens in any @xmath11 in the surface plane .",
    "interestingly , the surface - band dispersions observed by arpes are qualitatively the same in various experiments on single - crystal bi(111 ) @xcite as well as thin films possessing a few tens of biatomic layers ( bl ) grown on si(111 ) @xcite .",
    "specifically , all the observations show that @xmath5 merges into the bcb while @xmath6 merges into the bvb at @xmath8 .",
    "the surface - state dispersions simulated by theoretical calculations depend upon the computational methods , however .",
    "the dft calculations based on the local density approximation ( lda ) with soi , using slab geometry to mimic the crystal surface , obtain the surface bands depicted in fig .",
    "1(e ) @xcite . in this case , both @xmath5 and @xmath6 merge into the bvb at @xmath8 , and hence the surface band dispersion is trivial .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical prediction mentioned above , but disagrees with the arpes experiments .",
    "the other major method used to calculate the surface state is the so - called transfer - matrix ( tm ) method with the empirical tb model for bulk electronic states @xcite .",
    "based on this method , however , the calculated surface state exhibits an additional crossing between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as shown in fig .",
    "this unexpected crossing can be understood as the influence arising from an incorrect mirror chern number via the empirical tb parameters @xcite .",
    "further , another tm calculation based on a different set of tb parameters @xcite has resulted in surface bands without this unrealistic surface - state crossing , and is shown in fig .",
    "1(g ) . in this case",
    ", the dirac point lies in the projected bulk band gap at @xmath8 .",
    "the result in fig .",
    "1(g ) is also a topologically trivial surface - band dispersion because no surface band continuously connects the bvb and bcb .",
    "the main reason for the difficulty in calculating the electronic structure of single - crystal bi is that its bandgap is very small .",
    "the bandgap for single - crystal bi is @xmath1215 mev at @xmath13 in the bulk brillouin zone , corresponding to @xmath8 on the surface brillouin zone as shown in fig .",
    "one of the well - known weaknesses of dft is its inability to estimate the accurate size of the bandgap .",
    "actually , lda overestimates the size of the bandgap at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a recent study based on the quasiparticle self - consistent _ gw _ method including soi has improved the size of the bandgap @xcite . even using such state - of - the - art computational methods ,",
    "however , the topological order of single - crystal bi is still calculated to be trivial , which disagrees with the experimental results . in the tb calculation",
    ", the size of the bandgap agrees with the experiments because the tb parameters are empirically tuned to reproduce these experimental results , although the topological order was also calculated to be trivial .",
    "the tiny bulk bandgap at @xmath13 leads to `` flagile '' topological phase of single - crystal bi , because various perturbation from strain , ultrathin film thickness and so on can invert the energetical order of the bulk bands at @xmath13 .",
    "actually , a dft calculation taking the inter - surface interaction in the slab into account showed non - trivial surface - band dispersion as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) @xcite .",
    "recently , a tb calculation using the slab model also showed the surface states which disperses from bvb at @xmath7 to bcb at @xmath8 continuously @xcite .",
    "since the bulk topological order based on dft and tb with known parameter set is trivial , this result suggests the topological phase transition driven by ultrathin film thickness of bi .",
    "however , the magnitude of such finite - size effect , in other words , how thick the slab should be in order to calculate the surface states of bi obeying the bulk topological order , has not been studied yet .",
    "structural strain is also claimed as a source of topological phase transition .",
    "it is claimed that the in - plane structural strain in bi(111 ) ultrathin film causes the topological phase transition from trivial to non - trivial phase @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical study supports this results @xcite .",
    "however , there is still a discontinuity to the bulk case without strain : based on the arpes experiments , bi without strain should be topologically non - trivial and hence it is not clear where the topological phase transition takes place with lattice distortion .    in this work",
    ", we present the new set of tb parameters for calculating the surface states of single - crystal bi(111 ) , which agrees with the experimental arpes results .",
    "two sets of parameters were obtained that generate topologically trivial and non - trivial surface states for bi , where neither exhibit any artificial crossing such as that generated previously ( fig .",
    "1(e ) ) @xcite . based on the new tb parameters ,",
    "the surface - state calculations were performed by means of both the tm method and slab geometry . in both cases ,",
    "the calculated surface states agree well with previous experimental results , except for in the proximity of @xmath8 . around @xmath8 ,",
    "the surface - state dispersion changes depending upon the topological order of the bulk bands , where only the topologically non - trivial case agrees with the experiments .",
    "the influence of crystal lattice distortion was surveyed and a topological phase transition was found that was driven by in - plane expansion for the non - trivial bulk bands , which was opposite to the distortion suggested in a previous report @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the semi - infinite crystal , the slab calculation generated non - trivial surface - state dispersions irrespective of the bulk topological order , as has been the case for previous dft calculations using slab geometries .",
    "the role of the interaction between the top and bottom surfaces in the slab was systematically studied , and it was found that a very thick slab is required to obtain the bulk topological order of bi from the ( 111 ) surface states properly .",
    "specifically , the slab must be greater than 150 bl in our model .",

    "the resulting ( 16@xmath1816 ) matrix is shown in the appendix of ref . .",
    "next , the tb parameters were modified so that the calculated surface - state dispersion between @xmath7 and @xmath8 could be reproduced without any artificial crossing such as was obtained in ref . .",
    "in addition , the new parameters were tuned to maintain the energies of the electron / hole pockets and the size of the bandgap at @xmath13 at nearly the same value as the original parameter , which agrees with the experimental values .",

    "<S> the topological order of single - crystal bi and its surface states on the ( 111 ) surface are studied in detail based on empirical tight - binding ( tb ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> new tb parameters are presented that are used to calculate the surface states of semi - infinite single - crystal bi(111 ) , which agree with the experimental angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy results . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the crystal lattice distortion is surveyed and a topological phase transition is found that is driven by in - plane expansion . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the semi - infinite system , the surface - state dispersions on finite - thickness slabs are non - trivial irrespective of the bulk topological order . the role of the interaction between the top and bottom surfaces in the slab is systematically studied , and it is revealed that a very thick slab is required to properly obtain the bulk topological order of bi from the ( 111 ) surface state : above 150 biatomic layers in this case . </S>"
