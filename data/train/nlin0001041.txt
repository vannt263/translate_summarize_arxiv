    "quantum graphs have recently attracted a lot of interest @xcite . a review paper containing a list of references to previous work can be found in @xcite .",
    "the attention is due to the fact that quantum graphs can be viewed as typical and simple examples for the large class of systems in which classically chaotic dynamics implies universal spectral correlations in the semiclassical limit @xcite . up to now",
    "we have only a very limited understanding of the reasons for this universality . in a semiclassical approach to this problem",
    "the main stumbling block is the intricate interference between the contributions of ( exponentially many ) periodic orbits @xcite . using quantum graphs as model systems it is possible to pinpoint and isolate this central problem . in graphs ,",
    "an exact trace formula exists which is based on the periodic orbits of a mixing classical dynamical system @xcite .",
    "moreover the orbits can be specified by a finite symbolic code with markovian grammar .",
    "based on these simplifications it is possible to rewrite the spectral form factor or other two - point correlation functions in terms of a combinatorial problem @xcite .",
    "this combinatorial problem has been solved with promising results for selected graphs : it was shown that the form factor , ensemble averaged over graphs with a single non - trivial vertex and two attached bonds ( 2-hydra ) coincides exactly with the random - matrix result for the @xmath0 cue @xcite . in @xcite the short - time expansion of the form factor for @xmath1-hydra graphs ( i.  e.  one central node with @xmath1 bonds attached ) was computed in the limit @xmath2 , and in @xcite a periodic - orbit sum was used to prove anderson localization in an infinite chain graph with randomized bond lengths . in @xcite",
    "the form factor of binary graphs was shown to approach the random - matrix prediction when the number of vertices increases . in the present paper",
    "we develop a general method to implement the combinatorial sum on a computer .",
    "our results are always compared with direct numerical simulations .",
    "most of the studies on quantum graphs presented up to now were done with a fixed set of vertex boundary conditions at the vertices . in this case ,",
    "one of the main premises to find spectra following the random - matrix predictions is that _ all bond lengths of the graph are rationally independent_. in contrast , we will consider here also statistical properties of graph spectra _ averaged over the set of boundary conditions_. we show that in this case the form factor is in agreement with the random - matrix theory ( rmt ) predictions even when all bond lengths are degenerate .",
    "moreover , we show that one can express the form factor averaged over the vertex - scattering matrices as a combinatorial sum over families of orbits .",
    "this sum has the same structure as obtained in @xcite by performing a spectral average .",
    "this paper is structured in the following way . in the following section 2",
    ", the main definitions and properties of quantum graphs are given .",
    "we concentrate on the unitary bond - scattering matrix @xmath3 which can be interpreted as a quantum evolution operator on the graph .",
    "section 3 deals with the corresponding classical dynamical system . in section 4 , the statistical properties of the eigenphase spectrum of the bond - scattering matrix @xmath3 are analyzed and related to the periodic orbits of the classical dynamics . finally , our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "we start with a presentation and discussion of the schrdinger operator for graphs .",
    "graphs consist of @xmath4 _ vertices _ connected by @xmath5 _",
    "bonds_. the _ valency _ @xmath6 of a vertex @xmath7 is the number of bonds meeting at that vertex",
    ". the graph is called @xmath8_-regular _ if all the vertices have the same valency @xmath8 .",
    "when the vertices @xmath7 and @xmath9 are connected , we denote the connecting bond by @xmath10 . the same bond can also be referred to as @xmath11 or @xmath12 whenever we need to assign a direction to the bond . a bond with coinciding endpoints",
    "is called a _ loop_. finally , a graph is called _ bipartite _ if the vertices can be divided into two disjoint groups such that any vertices belonging to the same group are not connected .",
    "associated to every graph is its _ connectivity ( adjacency ) matrix _ @xmath13 .",
    "it is a square matrix of size @xmath4 whose matrix elements @xmath13 are given in the following way @xmath14 for graphs without loops the diagonal elements of @xmath15 are zero .",
    "the connectivity matrix of connected graphs can not be written as a block diagonal matrix .",
    "the valency of a vertex is given in terms of the connectivity matrix , by @xmath16 and the total number of undirected bonds is @xmath17 .    for the quantum description we assign to each bond",
    "@xmath10 a coordinate @xmath18 which indicates the position along the bond .",
    "@xmath18 takes the value @xmath19 at the vertex @xmath7 and the value @xmath20 at the vertex @xmath9 while @xmath21 is zero at @xmath9 and @xmath22 at @xmath7 .",
    "we have thus defined the _ length matrix _ @xmath22 with matrix elements different from zero , whenever @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the wave function @xmath26 contains @xmath5 components @xmath27 where the set @xmath28 consists of @xmath5 different undirected bonds .",
    "the schrdinger operator ( with @xmath29 ) is defined on a graph in the following way : on each bond @xmath30 , the component @xmath31 of the total wave function @xmath26 is a solution of the one - dimensional equation @xmath32 we included a  magnetic vector potential `` @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) which breaks the time reversal symmetry . in most applications we shall assume that all the @xmath36 s are equal and the bond index will be dropped . on each of the bonds ,",
    "the general solution of ( [ schrodinger ] ) is a superposition of two counter propagating waves @xmath37 the coefficients @xmath38 form a vector @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 of complex numbers which uniquely determines an element in a @xmath43dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this space corresponds to ' ' free wave \" solutions since we did not yet impose any conditions which the solutions of ( [ schrodinger ] ) have to satisfy at the vertices .",
    "the most general boundary conditions at the vertices are given in terms of unitary @xmath44 _ vertex - scattering matrices _",
    "@xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 go over all the vertices which are connected to @xmath9 . at each vertex @xmath9 ,",
    "incoming and outgoing components of the wave function are related by @xmath48 which implies current conservation .",
    "the particular form @xmath49 for the vertex - scattering matrices was shown in @xcite to be compatible with continuity of the wave function and current conservation at the vertices .",
    "( [ neumann ] ) is referred to as _ neumann _ boundary conditions .",
    "stationary states of the graph satisfy ( [ outin1 ] ) at each vertex .",
    "these conditions can be combined into @xmath50 such that the secular equation determining the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the graph is of the form @xcite @xmath51 = 0\\ , .",
    "\\label{secular}\\ ] ] here , the unitary _ bond - scattering matrix _",
    "@xmath52 acting in the @xmath53-dimensional space of directed bonds has been introduced .",
    "the matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given by @xmath56 @xmath55 contains the topology of the graph and is equivalent to the complete set of vertex - scattering matrices , while @xmath54 contains the metric information about the bonds .",
    "it is instructive to interpret the action of @xmath3 on an arbitrary graph state @xmath26 as its time evolution over an interval corresponding to the mean bond length of the graph such that @xmath57 clearly the solutions of ( [ outin2 ] ) are stationary with respect to this time evolution .",
    "@xmath58 in ( [ qevol ] ) represents a discrete ( topological ) time counting the collisions of the particle with vertices of the graph .",
    "in this section we discuss the classical dynamics corresponding to the quantum evolution ( [ qevol ] ) implied by @xmath59 . to introduce this dynamics we employ a liouvillian approach , where a classical evolution operator assigns transition probabilities in a phase space of @xmath53 directed bonds @xcite . if @xmath60 denotes the probability to occupy the ( directed ) bond @xmath30 at the ( discrete ) topological time @xmath61 , we can write down a markovian master equation of the form @xmath62 the classical ( frobenius - perron ) evolution operator @xmath63 has matrix elements @xmath64 with @xmath65 denoting the transition probability between the directed bonds @xmath66 and @xmath67 . to make the connection with the quantum description , we adopt the quantum transition probabilities , expressed as the absolute squares of matrix elements of @xmath3 @xmath68 note that @xmath69 and @xmath63 do not involve any metric information on the graph . in general , they may depend on the wave number @xmath70 .",
    "the unitarity of the bond - scattering matrix @xmath3 guarantees @xmath71 and @xmath72 , so that the total probability that the particle is on any bond remains conserved during the evolution .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath63 is restricted to the interior of the unit circle and @xmath73 is always an eigenvalue with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath74 . in most cases ,",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath75 is the only eigenvalue on the unit circle .",
    "then , the evolution is ergodic since any initial density will evolve to the eigenvector @xmath76 which corresponds to a uniform distribution ( equilibrium ) .",
    "the rate at which equilibrium is approached is determined by the gap to the next largest eigenvalue .",
    "if this gap exists , the dynamics is also mixing .",
    "graphs are one dimensional and the motion on the bonds is simple and stable .",
    "ergodic ( mixing ) dynamics is generated because at each vertex a ( markovian ) choice of one out of @xmath8 directions is made .",
    "thus , chaos on graphs originates from the multiple connectivity of the ( otherwise linear ) system @xcite .    despite the probabilistic nature of the classical dynamics , the concept of a classical orbit",
    "can be introduced .",
    "a classical orbit on a graph is an itinerary of successively connected directed bonds @xmath77 .",
    "an orbit is _ periodic _ with period @xmath58 if for all @xmath70 , @xmath78 . for graphs without loops or multiple bonds , the sequence of vertices @xmath79 with @xmath80 $ ] and @xmath81 for all @xmath47 represents a unique code for the orbit .",
    "this is a finite coding which is governed by a markovian grammar provided by the connectivity matrix . in this sense ,",
    "the symbolic dynamics on the graph is bernoulli .",
    "this analogy is strengthened by further evidence : the number of @xmath82po s on the graph is @xmath83 , where @xmath15 is the connectivity matrix . since its largest eigenvalue @xmath84 is bounded between the minimum and the maximum valency i.e. @xmath85 , periodic orbits proliferate exponentially with topological entropy @xmath86 .",
    "we consider the matrix @xmath87 defined in ( [ sb - matrix ] ) , ( [ scaco ] ) .",
    "the spectrum consist of @xmath53 points @xmath88 confined to the unit circle ( eigenphases ) .",
    "unitary matrices of this type are frequently studied since they are the quantum analogues of classical , area preserving maps .",
    "their spectral fluctuations depend on the nature of the underlying classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "the quantum analogues of classically integrable maps display poissonian statistics while in the opposite case of classically chaotic maps , the eigenphase statistics conform with the results of rmt for dyson s _ circular ensembles_. to describe the spectral fluctuations of @xmath59 we consider the form factor @xmath89 the average @xmath90 will be specified below .",
    "rmt predicts that @xmath91 depends on the scaled time @xmath92 only @xcite , and explicit expressions for the orthogonal and the unitary circular ensembles are known @xcite .    using ( [ sb - matrix ] ) , ( [ dandt ] ) we expand the matrix products in @xmath93 and obtain a sum of the form @xmath94 in this sum @xmath95 runs over all closed trajectories on the graph which are compatible with the connectivity matrix and which have the topological length @xmath58 , i.  e. they visit exactly @xmath58 vertices . for graphs ,",
    "the concepts of closed trajectories and periodic orbits coincide , hence ( [ posum ] ) can also be interpreted as a periodic - orbit sum . from ( [ posum ] )",
    "it is clear that @xmath96 as long as @xmath58 is smaller than the period of the shortest periodic orbit .",
    "the phase associated with an orbit is determined by its total ( metric ) length @xmath97 and by the  magnetic flux \" through the orbit .",
    "the latter is given in terms of its total _ directed _ length @xmath98 if we assume for simplicity that the magnitude of the magnetic vector potential is constant @xmath99 .",
    "the complex amplitude of the contribution from a periodic orbit by the product of all the elements of vertex - scattering matrices encountered @xmath100 } \\left(\\sigma^{(s)}_{r , t}\\right)^{n_p(r , s , t)}\\,,\\ ] ] i.  e.  for fixed boundary conditions at the vertices it is completely specified by the frequencies @xmath101 of all transitions @xmath102 . inserting ( [ posum ] ) into the definition of the form factor we obtain a double sum over periodic orbits @xmath103 this will be our starting point for the combinatorial approach presented in the following subsection .      in previous work @xcite the average in ( [ double - sum ] ) was always taken with respect to the wave number @xmath70 and , if present , also over the magnetic vector potential @xmath104 . within the present subsection",
    "we will stick to this procedure .",
    "provided that the bond lengths of the graph are rationally independent and that a sufficiently large interval is used for averaging , only terms with @xmath105 and @xmath106 survive .",
    "a completely equivalent result can be obtained by regarding the bond lengths @xmath107 of the graph as random numbers and performing an ensemble average over them .",
    "note that @xmath105 does _ not _ necessarily imply @xmath108 or that @xmath109 are related by some symmetry because there exist families @xmath110 of distinct but isometric orbits which can be used to write the result of ( [ double - sum ] ) in the form @xcite @xmath111 the outer sum is over the set @xmath112 of families , while the inner one is a _ coherent _ sum over the orbits belonging to a given family (= metric length ) . ( [ family - sum ] ) is exact , and it represents a combinatorial problem since it does not depend anymore on metric information about the graph ( the bond lengths ) .",
    "let us illustrate the application of ( [ family - sum ] ) in the following simple system : we consider a hydra graph with four arms and impose neumann boundary conditions at the central node such that forward and backward scattering amplitudes are given according to ( [ neumann ] ) by @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "for the moment we require that there are two pairs of identical bond lengths @xmath115 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "since hydra is a bipartite graph , an orbit can return only after an even number of vertex - scattering events ( note that the dead ends of the arms are considered as vertices ) .",
    "it is then convenient to replace the scattering matrix in ( [ ff ] ) by @xmath116 .",
    "as one can see from ( [ posum ] ) , that the form factor obtained in this way is equivalent to the one obtained from a graph which is formed by two loops of lengths @xmath117 and @xmath118 connected by a single vertex ( inset of fig .  1 ) .",
    "consider now the periodic orbits contributing to @xmath119 .",
    "the length of such an orbit is given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 denotes the number of traversals of a and b loop , respectively , and @xmath123 .",
    "if @xmath115 are rationally independent , a family of isometric orbits in ( [ family - sum ] ) contains all orbits sharing @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "these orbits differ , however , in their symbolic code by the order of a s and b s and by the _ orientation _ in which the loops are traversed .",
    "this is reflected in the amplitudes @xmath124 of the orbits : if two consecutive loops aa have different orientation , the amplitude @xmath125 contains a factor @xmath126 , while the same orientation results in @xmath127 .",
    "different loops following each other ( ab or ba ) always result in a factor @xmath127 .",
    "suppose now there is an orbit which contains in its code a sequence of the form @xmath40ab@xmath128b@xmath129b@xmath130",
    ". then there will be another orbit @xmath40ab@xmath128b@xmath129b@xmath130 which differs from the first one by an inversion of the orientation ( denoted by the prime ) of all but the first loop b. it is easy to see that the corresponding amplitudes cancel .",
    "this results in a tremendous simplification of the problem : it suffices in ( [ family - sum ] ) to keep track of all trajectories for which the cancellation does not apply .",
    "these are of the form a@xmath131 , b@xmath131 , ( ab)@xmath132 or ( ba)@xmath132 , the latter two existing for even @xmath58 only .",
    "each orbit a@xmath131 contributes the amplitude @xmath133 irrespective of the orientations of the @xmath58 loops .",
    "on the other hand there are @xmath134 possibilities to prescribe these orientations and hence the total contribution from each of the families a@xmath131 and b@xmath131 is 1 .",
    "there are also @xmath134 trajectories of the form ( ab)@xmath132 and ( ba)@xmath132 , respectively , each with amplitude @xmath133 .",
    "however these orbits belong to the same family @xmath135 , and their amplitudes must be added coherently in ( [ family - sum ] ) .",
    "this results in the total contribution 4 from this family . after adding the contributions from the three different families and normalizing with @xmath136 we are left with @xmath137 which is shown in fig .  1 with a solid line .",
    "neglecting the point @xmath138 , the form factor simply oscillates around the value 1even within the heisenberg time @xmath139 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behavior of a poissonian spectrum .",
    "the reason for this lack of correlations is that there exist regular sequences of eigenstates which are completely confined to one of the two loops or one pair of degenerate bonds , respectively .",
    "these states disappear when all arms of the hydra are incommensurate , and the corresponding form factor ( dashed line in fig .",
    "1 ) clearly reflects this change in the properties of the spectrum .",
    "the arguments which led to ( [ double - loop ] ) are deceivingly simple . in general",
    ", the combinatorial problem ( [ family - sum ] ) is very hard and can not be solved in closed form . even for the 4-hydra with incommensurate bond lengths",
    "this seems to be the case . nevertheless _",
    "result for finite @xmath58 as those shown in fig",
    ".  1 with a dashed line can always be obtained from ( [ family - sum ] ) using a computer algebra system such as maple @xcite .",
    "this will be shown in the following . to prescribe topology and boundary conditions , one should provide the time evolution operator @xmath59 according to ( [ sb - matrix ] ) but with the phases @xmath140 left as unspecified variables . for example , the operator @xmath59 for the graph discussed above has the form @xmath141,\\ ] ] where @xmath142 . in the general case",
    "there will be as many phases @xmath143 as there are incommensurate lengths in the graph .",
    "the quantity @xmath144 can now be represented as a multivariate polynomial of degree @xmath58 in the variables @xmath143 , i.  e.@xmath145 where @xmath146 runs over all partitions of @xmath58 into non - negative integers @xmath147 .",
    "the form factor is then simply given as @xmath148 the task of finding the coefficients @xmath149 can be expressed in maple with standard functions , such that after the initialization of @xmath59 the following four simple lines represent a completely general algorithm for the exact computation of the form factor of an arbitrary graph :    ....    sn:=evalm(s^n ) ;    tn:=expand(trace(sn ) ) :    c:=[coeffs(tn ) ] ;    k:=sum(c[p]^2,p=1 .. nops(c ) ) ; ....    in practice , however , the computation is restricted to the first few @xmath58 since the numerical effort grows exponentially fast .",
    "in fig .  2 we compare the results of ( [ coeffs ] ) with direct numerical averages for regular ( fully connected ) graphs with @xmath150 and @xmath151 vertices with and without magnetic field breaking the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the results agree indeed to a high precision .",
    "although this could be regarded merely as an additional confirmation of the numerical procedures used in @xcite , we see the main merit of ( [ coeffs ] ) in being a very useful tool for trying to find the solution of ( [ family - sum ] ) in closed form .      in the present section",
    "we generate an ensemble of graphs by randomizing the vertex - scattering matrices @xmath152 .",
    "the length matrix @xmath153 which contains the lengths of the bonds and the connectivity matrix ( topology of the graph ) are kept constant .",
    "moreover all the bond lengths are equal @xmath154 .",
    "we computed the form factor for fully connected graphs .",
    "our results for values of @xmath155 are presented in fig .",
    "the rmt two - point form factor @xcite is also displayed in fig .  3 for comparison .",
    "the results show quite a good agreement with the predictions of rmt for the circular ensembles .",
    "moreover , one can see that as the number of vertices @xmath4 increases , the agreement with rmt becomes progressively better .",
    "the deviations from the smooth curves are not statistical , and can not be ironed out by further averaging .",
    "rather , they are due to the fact that the graph is a dynamical system which can not be described by rmt in all detail .    in the remainder of this subsection",
    ", we would like to point out the possibility for turning ( [ double - sum ] ) into a combinatorial problem using the ensemble - average over @xmath152 .",
    "we assume that @xmath152 @xmath156 are independent random matrices chosen from the cue . in this case , the averaging in ( [ double - sum ] ) factorizes with respect to the vertices and we find @xmath157 } \\left(\\sigma^{(s)}_{r , t}\\right)^{n_{p}(r , s , t ) } \\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\left(\\sigma^{(s)*}_{r , t}\\right)^{n_{p'}(r , s , t ) } \\big\\rangle \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] averages over the cue of this type have been computed in the literature , see e.  g.  @xcite .",
    "the result is of the form @xmath158 where @xmath159 run over the permutations of @xmath160 and @xmath161 are some constants which can be obtained from a recursion relation . applied to ( [ orbit - pair ] ) this implies , that the contribution from a pair of orbits @xmath109 vanishes unless for all @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath163 ,",
    "i.  e.  unless the frequencies of traversals of any directed bond @xmath164 coincide for @xmath95 and @xmath165 . for the case of a graph with time - reversal symmetry , i.  e.",
    "when the vertex - scattering matrices are taken at random from the coe , a similar result ensures that only those pairs of orbits survive the averaging in ( [ orbit - pair ] ) which agree in the traversals of all _ undirected _ bonds .",
    "this means that the family structure underlying the set of periodic orbits is exactly the same as in the case of a graph with incommensurate bond lengths but fixed boundary conditions : the families are formed by those orbits which differ only in the time order of the traversed bonds . substituting this result into ( [ double - sum ] )",
    "we see that all oscillating phases containing metric information on the graph drop independent of the precise values of the bond lengths and we are indeed left with a combinatorial problem .",
    "in this paper we have tried to contribute to the understanding of the statistical properties of the unitary quantum time evolution operator derived from quantum graphs .",
    "this problem is relevant since it is a paradigm for the as yet unanswered question precisely under which conditions the quantum analogues of classically chaotic systems are universal and follow the random - matrix predictions .",
    "fully connected quantum graphs show this universality when the number of bonds becomes large . in extension to previous work",
    "we have demonstrated this result in the case where an ensemble of graphs is introduced by randomizing the boundary conditions at the vertices .",
    "the corresponding ensemble average can replace the previously considered spectral average , and the rmt results are in this case approached even when all the bond lengths are incommensurate .",
    "we have the hope that this kind of ensemble average might provide an easier access to an analytical treatment of the spectral properties of graphs .",
    "one possible approach of this goal is the use of combinatorial methods to perform the periodic - orbit sums related to spectral two - point correlations .",
