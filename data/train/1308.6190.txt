    "the interest in the theory of quantum physics on bent manifolds has received a boost since the experimental progresses in synthesizing low - dimensional nanostructures with curved geometries  the next generation nanodevices @xcite . from a purely theoretical point of view",
    ", the problem of the quantum motion of a particle living in a curved space has represented a matter of controversy for a long time @xcite .",
    "the problem arises because dirac quantization on a curved manifold leads to operator - ordering ambiguities@xcite .",
    "however , jensen and koppe @xcite and later da costa @xcite ( jkc ) have introduced a thin - wall quantisation procedure that circumvents this pitfall .",
    "it treats the quantum motion on a curved two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface  or analogously on a torsionless planar one - dimensional ( 1d ) curved manifold  as the limiting case of a particle in three - dimensional ( 3d ) space subject to lateral quantum confinement . for both 1d curved manifold and 2d surface with a translational invariant direction ,",
    "the jkc method allows to eliminate the surface curvature from the effective dimensionally reduced schrdinger equation at the expense of adding a potential term to it .",
    "the problem is therefore substantially simplified , since quantum carriers can actually live in a 2d or 1d space in the presence of a curvature - induced quantum geometric potential ( qgp ) . on the nanoscale",
    ", the qgp can actually cause many intriguing phenomena @xcite .",
    "for instance , a quantum particle constrained to a periodically curved surface senses a periodic qgp acting as a topological crystal@xcite .",
    "likewise the qgp in spirally rolled - up nanostructures leads to winding - generated bound states@xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of these fascinating phenomena is hindered by the fact that in actual systems with curvature radii on the order of a few hundred nanometers , the qgp is still very weak ",
    "it is in magnitude proportional to @xmath0  and typically only comes into play on the sub - kelvin energy scale .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that by accounting for the effect of the deformation potentials of the model - solid theory @xcite , the strain field induced by the curvature leads to a strain - induced geometric potential ( sgp ) which has the same functional form as the qgp but strongly boosting it .",
    "one can not therefore distinguish between curvature - induced quantum effects and curvature - induced classical strain effects in nanosystems  they are always present and contribute in different amount to the same geometric potential .    in this work ,",
    "we show that this strain field of bent nanostructures leads to a curvature - induced rashba spin - orbit interaction whose strength follows precisely the local curvature of the manifold .",
    "this is immediately relevant for electronic nanodevices since the modern nanostructuring method@xcite is based on the tendency of thin films detached from their substrates to assume a shape yielding the lowest possible elastic energy . as a result",
    ", thin films can either roll up into tubes@xcite or undergo wrinkling to form nanocorrugated structures@xcite .",
    "the nanoscale variation of the strain represents a key property of such bent nanostructures .",
    "it leads to considerable band - edge shifts@xcite with regions under tensile and compressive strain shifting in opposite directions .",
    "strain is thus widely used and applied in nanosystems and here we put forward that it intrinsically leads to spin - orbit effects .",
    "we apply this theoretical framework to both curved two - dimensional systems and one - dimensional curved quantum wires , showing that in the latter case two different rashba - like spin - orbit interactions come into play enhancing spin - orbit splittings .",
    "in the thin - wall quantization procedure , quantum excitation energies in the normal direction are raised far beyond those in the tangential direction . this allows to neglect the quantum motion in the normal direction and derive an effective , dimensionally reduced , schrdinger equation .",
    "as opposed to a classical particle , a quantum particle constrained to a curved surface retains some knowledge of the surrounding 3d space . in spite of the absence of interactions",
    ", it indeed experiences the well - known attractive qgp @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the jkc thin - wall quantization procedure to derive the effective schrdinger equation is well - founded , also in the presence of externally applied electric and magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "empirical evidence for the validity of this approach is provided by the experimental realization of an optical analogue of the curvature - induced geometric potential@xcite .    in order to derive the effective hamiltonian for a curved two - dimensional electron gas with spin - orbit interaction ( soi )",
    ", we therefore use the same conceptual framework of the jkc thin - wall quantization procedure @xcite .",
    "the mathematical description is set by defining a 3d curvilinear coordinate system for the tubular nanostructure .",
    "we parameterize the stress - free surface @xmath1 as @xmath2 where @xmath3 indicates the coordinate along the translationally invariant direction of the the tubular nanostructure and @xmath4 corresponds to the arclength along the curved direction of the thin film .",
    "the entire portion of the nanostructure can be similarly parameterized as @xmath5 where @xmath6 indicates the unit vector normal to the bent direction of the thin film and is oriented so that regions with @xmath7 are under compressive strain for positive values of the radius of curvature and under tensile strain for negative ones [ see fig.[fig : fig1 ] ] .",
    "the strain distribution of the thin film can be easily derived assuming the in - plane strain condition@xcite @xmath8 .",
    "this can be justified in nanostructures with a characteristic dimension along the @xmath3 direction much larger than the structural dimensions in the remaining coordinates . following landau @xcite , the strain component along the bent structure of the thin film reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 indicates the only non - vanishing principal curvature of the curved stress - free two - dimensional manifold .",
    "the remaining strain component in the normal direction @xmath11 is related to @xmath12 by @xmath13 \\epsilon_{s s}$ ] with @xmath14 the poisson ratio .     and",
    "compressive one for @xmath15 , scaledwidth=43.0% ]    as the linear deformation potential theory @xcite predicts a strain - induced shift of the conduction band , local variations of the strain thus render a local potential for the conducting electrons @xmath16 which always implies an attraction towards the tensile regions of the thin film .",
    "here we have introduced the characteristic energy scale @xmath17 , proportional to the hydrostatic deformation potential of the conduction valley of the nanostructure , which typically lies in the ev scale for conventional semiconductors @xcite . as the strain field produces an asymmetric confining potential along the normal direction of the bent surface , it will immediately yield an average electric field @xmath18 whose strength is proportional to the curvature of the nanostructure .",
    "the strain field therefore leads to a curvature - induced rashba soi .",
    "the resulting schrdinger equation in the effective mass approximation will thus read @xmath19 where we adopted einstein summation convention , @xmath20 is the pauli matrix vector and @xmath21 the ordinary momentum operator in cartesian coordinates . in eq.[eq : eq1 ] , @xmath22 corresponds to the 3d metric tensor which for our coordinate system takes the simple diagonal form @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "finally the covariant derivative @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 with @xmath27 the covariant components of a generic 3d vector field , and @xmath28 representing the christoffel symbols @xmath29 .\\ ] ] with this , the schrdinger equation eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] can be simply expanded in our curvilinear coordinate system as @xmath30 \\psi \\nonumber \\\\ & &   - i \\alpha \\left ( \\sigma_s \\partial_y - \\dfrac{\\sigma_y}{h(s ) } \\partial_s \\right ) \\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and the momentum along the bent direction of the nanostructure is @xmath32 .",
    "we have also introduced a squeezing potential in the normal direction @xmath33 . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was assumed to be given by two infinite step potential barriers at @xmath34 with @xmath35 the total thickness of the thin film . in the remainder",
    "we will instead consider the case of an harmonic trap @xmath36 to show that the ensuing results are not dependent on the specific form of the squeezing potential at hand . to proceed further",
    "we introduce , in the same spirit of the thin - wall quantization procedure , a rescaled wavefunction @xmath37 for which the surface density probability is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "the resulting schrdinger equation is then determined by an effective hamiltonian @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\   & & -\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^{\\star } } \\dfrac{\\left(\\partial_{q_{3 } } h(s ) \\right)^2}{4 \\ , h(s)^2 } + { \\cal v}_{\\lambda } ( q_3 ) + { \\cal v}_{\\epsilon}(s , q_3 )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & - i \\alpha \\left(\\sigma_s \\partial_z - \\sigma_z \\dfrac{\\partial_s}{h(s ) } \\right ) + i \\alpha \\sigma_z   \\dfrac{\\partial_s h(s)}{h(s)^{\\frac{3}{2 } } } .",
    "\\label{eq : effectivehamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large enough strength of the squeezing potential in the normal direction , we can follow ref .",
    "@xcite and expand the hamiltonian of eq.[eq : effectivehamiltonian ] as @xmath40 . at the zeroth order in @xmath11 and retaining the leading order correction linear in @xmath11 ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian reads : @xmath41 the strong size quantisation along the normal direction allows to employ the adiabatic approximation and consider an ansatz for the wave function @xmath42 with @xmath43 solving at fixed @xmath4 the one - dimensional schrdinger equation for the fast normal degrees of freedom which is regulated by the hamiltonian @xmath44 the spectrum of the hamiltonian above can be easily read as @xmath45 . with this , the effective hamiltonian for the slow tangential quantum degrees of freedom can be found by integrating out the @xmath11 degrees of freedom .",
    "we then get the dimensionally reduced effective hamiltonian @xmath46 it has the same functional form of the effective hamiltonian for a planar two - dimensional electron gas with rashba spin - orbit interaction and a geometric potential whose magnitude @xmath47 is strongly renormalised by the strain - induced geometric potential @xcite .",
    "we point out that for systems with an intrinsic soi the normal and tangential degrees of freedom , curvature induced geometric potential proportional to the mean curvature of the manifold can appear  @xcite .",
    "these terms are absent in the strain - induced rashba spin - orbit coupling because of the presence of the normal potential gradient .",
    "we next use this theoretical framework to derive the effective dimensionally reduced hamiltonian considering the case of a rolled - up cylindrical nanotube and a nanocorrugated thin film . for a cylindrical nanotube of radius @xmath48",
    "the arclength can be easily expressed in cylindrical coordinates as @xmath49 and",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian for a cylindrical two - dimensional electron gas ( c2deg ) then reads @xcite @xmath50 where we have neglected the geometric potential since it corresponds to a rigid shift of the energies . for a nanocorrugated thin film instead , we start out by parametrizing the stress - free surface in the monge gauge as @xmath51 with @xmath52 indicating the height of the corrugation with respect to its planar counterpart . in cartesian",
    "coordinates then the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath53 ^ 3 }   \\\\ & & -   \\dfrac{i \\alpha}{\\sqrt{1 + h^{\\prime}(x)^2 } }   \\left(\\sigma_x   \\partial_z + \\sigma_y h^{\\prime}(x ) \\partial_z - \\sigma_z \\partial_x \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we now apply the theoretical framework we developed in the previous section to planar curved one - dimensional electron gases . in this case , due to the asymmetric confinement in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the curved one - dimensional systems ( @xmath54 following the definition of the curvilinear coordinate system given in sec.ii ) there is an additional rashba soi different from the strain - induced one .",
    "the effective schrdinger equation reads @xmath55 since there is no coupling among the curvature of the one - dimensional planar wire and the direction normal to the plane , we can safely neglect the degrees of freedom in its direction .",
    "by expanding eq.[eq : eq2 ] by covariant calculus we get the schrdinger equation in the planar two - dimensional space as @xmath56 \\psi   \\\\ & & + i \\alpha \\left (   \\dfrac{\\sigma_z}{h(s ) } \\partial_s \\right ) \\psi - i \\alpha_r   \\left (   \\dfrac{\\sigma_n}{h(s ) } \\partial_s   - \\sigma_s \\partial_{q_3 } \\right ) \\psi \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "the effective dimensionally reduced one - dimensional schrdinger equation can be found by first performing a scaling of the wavefunction so that the one - dimensional surface density probability reads @xmath58 , then expanding the resulting hamiltonian as in sec.ii and finally employing the method of adiabatic separation among the fast normal quantum degree of freedom @xmath11 an the planar slow quantum degree of freedom @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is @xmath59 which agrees with the hamiltonian for a curved one - dimensional quantum wire proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite once the strain - induced rashba soi is neglected . to analyse the influence of the latter , we now consider the example of a closed quantum ring @xcite shown schematically in fig.[fig : fig3 ] .",
    "normal to the ring.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]     and different values of the strain - induced rashba soi @xmath60 .",
    "energies are measured in units of @xmath61 .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting is generally enhanced by the effect of the rashba soi.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    adopting polar coordinates we have @xmath62 whereas @xmath49 . with this",
    ", the effective hamiltonian for the 1d ring can be then solved using a trial spinorial wave function of the form @xmath63^{t}$ ] where @xmath64 can only assume half - integer values to fulfill the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the amplitude @xmath65 and @xmath66 depends on @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding energy spectrum can be simply found as @xmath67 as shown in fig.[fig : fig4 ] the strain - induced rashba soi enhances the spin - orbit splitting due to the rashba soi in the direction perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the spin properties of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian01d ] are not modified by the presence of the strain - induced rashba soi .",
    "indeed , the expectation values for @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "this implies that the averaged spin projection , as expected , is pointing perpendicularly to the ring along the radial direction while the tangential component is vanishing .",
    "there is also a non trivial @xmath72projection which is given by @xmath73 . in particular",
    ", such term tends to enhance the out - of - plan spin projection .",
    "we expect this contribution to amplify the curvature effects on the spin transport properties of quantum rings  @xcite .",
    "we have derived , in conclusion , a dimensionally reduced schrdinger equation with spin - orbit interaction in two - dimensional and effective one - dimensional electronic strain - driven nanostructures . by employing a method of adiabatic separation of fast and slow quantum degrees of freedom",
    ", we have shown that the effects of a finite curvature are twofold .",
    "first , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , the strain effects render an often gigantic renormalisation of the curved - induced quantum geometric potential .",
    "second , the asymmetric confinement due to the strain field leads to a rashba - type spin - orbit interaction whose strength is proportional to the local curvature of the nanostructure . applying this theoretical framework to one - dimensional curved quantum wires leads to an enhanced spin - orbit splitting due to the presence of two rashba - type soi .",
