    "dust grains exist everywhere . the inside of h ii regions is not an exception ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation from celestial objects is always absorbed and scattered by the grains . without correction for the dust extinction , we inevitably underestimate the intrinsic intensity of the radiation , and our understanding of the physics of these objects may be misled . in order to evaluate the amount of the dust extinction in detail , it is important to know the distribution of dust as well as its optical properties .    theoretically , some attempts to reveal the dust distribution in h ii regions have been made to date @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , the radiation pressure on the dust grains by the central source causes a central hole of dust and gas .",
    "the dust distribution has also been observationally investigated . from the observed flux ratio of h @xmath0 to continuum , @xcite",
    "have shown that the gas - dust ratio decreases with radius in the orion nebula . from radial photometric profiles at @xmath1-band of some h ii regions ,",
    "@xcite also suggest that a dust depletion zone is in the central region ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the central dust cavity is supported by fitting to the observed infrared ( ir ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of h ii regions @xcite .",
    "recently , such dust geometry is preferred not only by ir sed fitting but also by the radial photometric profiles at submillimeter range @xcite . in addition , we have some evidence of central gaseous cavities from radio observations @xcite .",
    "since dust and gas are well coupled each other @xcite , the presence of a gaseous cavity indicates a dust cavity .",
    "although the dust cavity is likely to exist , it has not been observed directly in the far - infrared ( fir ) band , which is dominated by the thermal emission from dust .",
    "this is because the fir observations are not advanced relative to other wavelengths , and moreover , the spatial resolving power of fir imaging is generally weak .",
    "recently , more detailed observational data have been obtained by _ iso _ ( infrared space observatory ) and scuba ( submillimeter common - user bolometer array ) , and many successive facilities are planned in the near future ( sirtf , sofia , astro - f , alma , etc . ) . by using these new powerful facilities ,",
    "we may observe the dust distribution directly .",
    "we need to estimate the detectability of the cavity by these facilities .",
    "on the other hand , we have dveloped a method for determining the fraction of lyman continuum ( lc ) photons contributing to hydrogen ionization ( @xcite , hereafter paper i and paper ii , respectively ) . in paper",
    "i and ii , we show that only half of lc photons from the central source in an h ii region ionizes neutral hydrogens , and the rest are absorbed by dust grains within the ionized region .",
    "if a dust cavity exists in the ionized region , however , the efficiency of the dust absorption for the lc photons becomes small . in this paper",
    ", we examine whether the estimated photon fraction is reproduced by a model nebula with a central dust cavity .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our method for examining the dust distribution , especially the central dust cavity s radius , by using the fraction of lc photons contributing to hydrogen ionization . in section 3 , we apply it to the sample h ii regions in the galaxy .",
    "then , we discuss the formation mechanism of the dust cavity and its detectability by some ir facilities in section 4 . finally , we summarize our conclusions in the last section .",
    "we assume an ideal spherical nebula composed of only hydrogen and dust because the effect of helium is not so important for the determination of the dust distribution .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the last paragraph of section 2.3.2 .",
    "moreover , we assume the volume number densities of hydrogen and dust to be constant , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "if densities of neutral hydrogen atoms , protons , and electrons , are represented by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively , we have @xmath7 and @xmath8 in terms of the ionization degree , @xmath9 , which varies with the radius , @xmath10 , from the central exciting source . in addition",
    ", we assume the frequencies of all lc photons to be that of the lyman limit , that is , all quantities are treated monochromatically in our transfer model .",
    "this is because we obtain only the number of lc photons from observations of recombination lines or thermal radio emissions from h ii regions .",
    "we introduce a dimensionless radius , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the classical strmgren radius which is defined as @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the intrinsic production rate of lc photons of the central source , and @xmath15 is the case b recombination coefficient of hydrogen .",
    "we consider the change of the number of lc photons passing through the shell whose inner and outer radii are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "if the number of lc photons entering the shell per unit time denotes @xmath18 , its change in the shell is @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are cross sections for lc photons of neutral hydrogen atoms and dust grains , respectively , @xmath22 is the dust albedo for these photons , and @xmath23 is the recombination coefficient to the ground state of hydrogen .",
    "we neglect the asymmetric effect of the dust scattering for simplicity .",
    "since the shell is in ionization equilibrium , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coefficient of hydrogen recombination to all levels .",
    "we note that @xmath26 . by equation ( [",
    "eq2 - 2 ] ) and replacing @xmath4 with @xmath27 , equation ( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath28 where @xmath29 this is a correction term for existence of dust grains in the nebula .",
    "if we define the total ( gas + dust ) optical depth for lc photons as @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31",
    ". then equation ( [ eq2 - 2 ] ) is reduced to @xmath32    now we define the ionization parameter as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the light speed",
    ". then equations ( [ eq2 - 5.1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 3 ] ) are reduced to @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .    finally , we determine two recombination coefficients of hydrogen , @xmath25 and @xmath15 .",
    "the coefficients are a function of the electron temperature , @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "fitting values in table 5.2 of @xcite , we can approximate them to the following equation ; @xmath38 for @xmath39 , where @xmath40 or @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the uncertainties of values determined by these equation are less than 1% for the above range of @xmath44 .",
    "let us estimate the dust effect that appears in the term , @xmath45 . we adopt the dust extinction law in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) developed by @xcite , who have derived a size - distribution function of dust grains composed of carbonaceous and silicate populations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their carbonaceous grain includes pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ) molecules .",
    "@xcite have developed the extinction laws for various values of @xmath46 , which is the ratio of the visual extinction to color excess .",
    "we approximate the optical depths for lc photons by hydrogen and dust to those at 912  . according to @xcite , the dust cross sections per unit hydrogen nucleus at 912   i.e. @xmath47 are @xmath48 @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath49 , and @xmath51 @xmath49 , for @xmath52 , 4.0 , and 5.5 , respectively .",
    ", we adopt the law with the parameter set of case a and @xmath53 , which represents c abundance of very small grain population . also , we adopt the laws with the parameter sets of case b and @xmath54 , or case b and @xmath55 for @xmath56 , or 5.5 , respectively .",
    "values of other parameters are tabulated in table 1 in @xcite . ]",
    "we note that these values are calibrated by @xmath57 @xmath49 , where @xmath58 is the hydrogen column density .",
    "also , the dust albedos at 912   are 0.2451 , 0.2694 , and 0.2989 for @xmath52 , 4.0 , and 5.5 , respectively .",
    "if we adopt @xmath59 @xmath49 , equation ( [ eq2 - 5 ] ) is reduced to @xmath60    here , we introduce a parameter for the dust distribution , the dimensionless dust cavity s radius , @xmath61 , because the dust distribution may have a radial dependence as strongly suggested in the literature (  1 ) . for simplicity , we consider an extreme case that no dust is inside the cavity s radius , @xmath61 , and the gas - dust ratio is constant outside of it .",
    "that is , the dust term , @xmath45 , is zero within @xmath61 , and constant value shown above outside of it .",
    "now , we can solve the photon transfer problem .",
    "if the ionization parameter , @xmath62 , is given , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 at @xmath65 are adopted as the boundary condition , we obtain the ionization degree , @xmath9 , at any radius , @xmath16 , from equations ( [ eq2 - 5.3 ] ) and ( [ eq2 - 5.4 ] ) for a set of @xmath46 and @xmath44 .",
    "the dust inner radius , @xmath61 , is only one free parameter in our photon transfer model .",
    "as investigated in paper i and ii , not all of the intrinsic lc photons emitted by the central source of h ii regions is consumed in hydrogen ionization .",
    "in other words , the number of lc photons contributing to the ionization , i.e. ionizing photons , is always less than the intrinsic one .",
    "then , we define the ionizing photon fraction , @xmath66 , as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath14 are the production rates of the ionizing and intrinsic lc photons , respectively . for the ionizing photons , the production rate , @xmath68 ,",
    "is determined from the observational data , whereas the intrinsic production rate , @xmath14 , can not be obtained observationally .",
    "let us determine the fraction , @xmath66 , via two ways below .",
    "first , we determine the fraction from our transfer model .",
    "according to paper i , the fraction , @xmath66 , is reduced to @xmath69 for a perfectly ionized nebula ( i.e. , @xmath64 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 ) , where @xmath73 is the dimensionless radius of the ionized region .    total number of proton in a nebula is @xmath74 in our transfer model . on the other hand ,",
    "the proton number is equal to @xmath75 in the perfectly ionized nebula . since our solutions of the photon transfer model",
    "indicate that the nebula is regarded as the perfectly ionized nebula , we can equate above two quantities each other .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the position to stop calculating .",
    "we can choose the value of @xmath77 arbitrarily if it is larger than @xmath73 .",
    "in this paper , @xmath78 is adopted as a constant for simplicity .",
    "therefore , we can determine @xmath66 as a function of the dust inner radius , @xmath61 , for three @xmath46 values , if an ionization parameter , @xmath62 , is given .",
    "we note that the fraction determined from above equation ( [ eq2 - 7 ] ) becomes equivalent to that in section 2 of paper i if @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    in figure 1",
    ", we show such results for various sets of @xmath62 and @xmath46 when we adopt @xmath81 k which is a mean electron temperature of the sample h ii regions described in section 3 .",
    "we find that @xmath66 decreases if @xmath61 decreases .",
    "this is because the dust optical depth is large as the cavity s radius is small .",
    "we also find that @xmath66 decreases if @xmath62 increases , which is equivalent that @xmath66 decreases if @xmath14 or @xmath2 increases ( eq.[[eq2 - 5.2 ] ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the ionizing photon fraction for a dust - gas ratio @xmath82 ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "since the dust - gas ratios are different from one region to others ( e.g. , @xcite for the smc ) , we should determine the ratio for the individual h ii region .",
    "however , we use the above dust - gas ratio for all sample regions , because we can not determine it individually . ] becomes smaller as the number of lc photons from the central source becomes larger or as the density of the surrounding medium becomes higher .",
    "the relation between @xmath66 and @xmath61 is also a function of @xmath46 , as shown especially in figure 2 ( a ) .",
    "that is , the ionizing photon fraction for a fixed dust cavity s radius becomes smaller , as the value of @xmath46 becomes smaller .",
    "this is because the dust extinction law of a smaller @xmath46 shows a steeper rise at the far - ultraviolet range @xcite .",
    "since a higher value of @xmath46 is suitable for a higher density region @xcite , we select @xmath83 for our sample h ii regions discussed in section 3 .",
    "moreover , we see the variation of the @xmath66-@xmath61 relation for the change of the adopted electron temperature , @xmath44 .",
    "we find in figure 2 ( b ) that @xmath66 becomes smaller as @xmath44 becomes higher , because recombination coefficients becomes larger as @xmath44 increases .",
    "next , we determine the ionizing photon fraction , @xmath66 , from the observational data . according to paper i and ii",
    ", we can estimate @xmath66 from the ratio of the ir luminosity , @xmath84 , to the ionizing photon production rate , @xmath68 , ( equation [ 2 ] in paper ii ) unless a significant amount of lc photons escapes from h ii regions .",
    "however , in the derivation in paper ii , the stellar sed are assumed to be the planck function .",
    "thus , we overestimate the intrinsic production rate of lc photons , and then , we underestimate @xmath66 in paper ii .    in this paper , we adopt a realistic stellar spectra , the kurucz s atlas 9 spectra with solar abundance and turbulence speed of 2 km s@xmath85 . then , if a salpeter s imf ( 0.1100 @xmath86 ) is assumed , we derive the following formula ; @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the average efficiency of dust absorption for nonionizing uv ( @xmath89  ) photons , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the total ir luminosity and ionizing photon production rate normalized by @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 s@xmath85 , respectively . the value of @xmath66 obtained from the above equation is typically 1.2 times larger than that from the equation ( 2 ) in paper ii because of the modification of adopted stellar sed .",
    "when we estimate @xmath88 from the observed color excess ( see paper ii for detail ) , we determine @xmath66 of individual h ii region from its @xmath84 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is worthwhile to nate that since the above equation is based on a simple energy conservation , the obtained @xmath66 is independent of the dust distribution , the structure of h ii regions and so on .",
    "once @xmath66 is obtained , we can determine the intrinsic lc photon production rate by using equation ( [ eq2 - 6.1 ] ) , and can determine the ionization parameter , @xmath62 . using the obtained @xmath62 , we determine @xmath61 so as to reproduce @xmath66 determined from equation ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) by using our photon transfer model ( i.e. eq.[[eq2 - 7 ] ] ) . in the next section ,",
    "we determine a typical @xmath61 for a sample of the galactic h ii regions .",
    "we discuss the effect of the presence of helium .",
    "of course , helium atoms absorb lc photons as well as hydrogen and dust .",
    "however , the fraction of stellar lc photons ionizing helium is small , @xmath95 10% .",
    "even if all helium ionizing photons are consumed by only helium , the fraction of photons ionizing hydrogen , @xmath66 , becomes at most 10% smaller than that determined by equation ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) .",
    "thus , the determined @xmath61 decreases at most 10% . since not all helium ionizing photons are absorbed by helium and most of helium recombination photons can ionize hydrogen @xcite , the effect of helium is negligible for our analysis .",
    "in order to determine the inner radius of the dust distribution , @xmath96 of an h ii region , we need various data ; the electron density and temperature , the ionizing photon production rate , the infrared luminosity , and @xmath46 . here , the value of @xmath46 is assumed to be constant , 5.5 .",
    "the effect of the change of @xmath46 is discussed quantitatively in the last part of this section .",
    "we find a suitable data set of the galactic h ii regions in @xcite , which examined the physical properties of 23 h ii regions in the galaxy observed by the kuiper airborne observatory .",
    "we select 13 h ii regions from the sample of @xcite .",
    "the adopted selection criterion is that the measured electron number density exceeds 1000 @xmath97 .",
    "the selected regions are classified into the compact or ultra - compact h ii regions from their densities @xcite .",
    "the spherical geometry of our transfer model may be not so bad for such sample , although even the ultra - compact h ii regions sometimes show non - spherical shapes @xcite . for",
    "more evolving h ii regions than the compact class , which often show very complex shapes , e.g. , blister , bubble , champagne , etc . , the spherical assumption is not valid .",
    "the observed and measured quantities of the sample regions are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "first , we estimate the ionizing photon fraction , @xmath66 , for each sample region . the ionizing photon production rate , @xmath68 , is estimated from the flux density of free - free radio emission at 5 ghz by the formula in @xcite : @xmath98 . the total ir ( 81000 )",
    "luminosity , @xmath84 , is estimated from the observed ir ( 18160 ) flux by an upward factor of 1.26 , assuming the dust sed to be the modified planck function of 30 k with the emissivity index of 1 .",
    "the conversion factor varies between 1.031.26 if we change the adopted parameter sets of the dust temperature ( 3040 k ) and the emissivity index ( 12 ) .",
    "thus , the conversion causes at most 20 % uncertainty of the derived ir luminosity . the determined @xmath68 and @xmath84",
    "are given in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of table 2 , respectively .    since we do not have the color excess , @xmath99 , of sample regions , we assume @xmath100 , which correspond to a typical @xmath99 of the galactic h ii regions observed by @xcite ( see paper ii ) .",
    "the determined @xmath66 may be overestimated if the true value of @xmath88 is smaller than unity .",
    "indeed , if we set @xmath101 , the value of @xmath66 becomes about 90 % of the determined here .",
    "now , we can determine @xmath66 for each sample region via equation ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) , and give the values in column ( 4 ) of table 2 .",
    "the mean value and standard deviation of @xmath66 for 13 sample regions are 0.55 and 0.22 , respectively .",
    "thus , only half of lc photons contributes to hydrogen ionization in the h ii regions of the galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with the results in @xcite , paper i and ii .    since the ionizing photon fraction , @xmath66 , is indirect measurement value , many uncertainties of adopted quantities",
    "suppose a quantity , @xmath102 , is represented by a functional form , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is more basic quantities .",
    "if uncertainties of @xmath104 are represented by @xmath105 , and all quantities of @xmath104 are independent each other , the uncertainty of @xmath102 can be expressed by @xmath106 . in this way",
    ", the uncertainty of @xmath107 is estimated to be about 30 % typically .",
    "the main causes of the uncertainty are that of the adopted radio flux densities , about 20 % @xcite . taking account of the uncertainties of the coefficients in equation ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) and the parameter , @xmath88 , we estimate a typical uncertainty of @xmath66 to be about 33 % , which corresponds to @xmath108 for the mean @xmath66 .",
    "thus , a somewhat large value of @xmath66 for g298.22 - 0.34 , in stead of @xmath109 by the definition , may be caused by this uncertainty .",
    "next , we determine the dust cavity s radius , @xmath61 , of sample regions . by using the estimated @xmath66",
    ", we can convert the ionizing photon production rate , @xmath68 , into the intrinsic lc one , @xmath110 , that is , @xmath111 .",
    "then , we calculate the ionization parameter , @xmath62 , of the individual sample region by equation ( [ eq2 - 5.2 ] ) shown in column ( 5 ) in table 2 . here",
    ", we determine @xmath61 so that @xmath66 estimated from equation ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) is equal to @xmath66 calculated from our transfer model ( i.e. , eq . [",
    "[ eq2 - 7 ] ] ) .",
    ", we adopt the recombination coefficients calculated from the individual electron temperature by equation ( [ eq2 - 5.5 ] ) . ] the obtained values of @xmath61 are given in the last column in table 2 .",
    "the mean value of the determined @xmath61 and its standard deviation are 0.39 and 0.23 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty of the individual value of @xmath61 caused by that of the estimated @xmath66 is about @xmath108 .    in figure 3 , we show histograms of the derived quantities . from the panels ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , we can divide the sample into two groups : one is the ultra - compact h ii regions , whose strmgren radius , ( or the ionized radius , @xmath112 ) is smaller than 0.5 pc ( 0.4 pc ) .",
    "the other is the compact h ii regions with more larger radii . here",
    ", we should note that g298.22 - 0.34 is removed from the following discussions because of its anomalous value of @xmath66 , and s156 is also removed because of its very small luminosity relative to others .",
    "the two classifications are indicated in figure 3 and table 1 . in table 3 , we summarize the mean properties of the sample of the two groups . although our classification is based on the radius of sample regions , the classification is caused by the difference of the electron density , and are consistent with that of @xcite .    for the compact sample ,",
    "we estimate the mean value of @xmath61 to be @xmath113 , where the error is the sum of two uncertainties of the mean value ; one results from the variation among sample regions , and the other from the uncertainty of individual value .",
    "the estimated error is coincident with the sample standard deviation . for the ultra - compact sample",
    ", the mean value of @xmath61 is estimated to be @xmath114 .",
    "the error is the same mean as that of the compact sample .",
    "the non - zero mean value of @xmath61 obtained above may results from a somewhat large uncertainty of individual object .",
    "if we assume that the sample regions compose a normal population , we can test whether the mean @xmath61 of the population is regarded to be zero .",
    "if the variance of @xmath61 for the population is estimated to be square of the uncertainty of individual value , @xmath115 , we can reject the hypothesis of the mean @xmath116 with the significance level of 0.0011% for the compact sample , and 0.0016% for the ultra - compact sample .",
    "therefore , even if we take account of somewhat large uncertainties of the observations and the model , the ionizing photon fraction can not be reproduced by a nebula filled with dust uniformly ( i.e. @xmath116 ) .",
    "the dust distribution with the central cavity is supported by our analysis independently of the ir sed fitting or the photometric profile analysis .",
    "the cavity s radius in units of the strmgren radius ( i.e. @xmath117 ) of the ultra - compact sample is larger than that of the compact sample .",
    "the real scale of the cavity s radii of both samples are about 0.3 pc and 0.2 pc for compact and ultra - compact , respectively .",
    "we may see an evolutionary sequence of the dust cavity from ultra - compact to compact. however , these values are agree with each other within their error bars , and the ultra - compact sample consists of only three regions .",
    "thus , it is uncertain whether the difference between the cavity s radii of two subsamples is real or not .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the effect of the change of @xmath46 on the obtained dust cavity s radius , @xmath61 . as shown in figure 2 ( a ) , the value of @xmath61 increases for a fixed ionizing photon fraction , @xmath66 , if @xmath46 decreases .",
    "this is shown quantitatively for three sample set in table 4 .",
    "for the compact sample , the value of @xmath61 of @xmath52 is a factor of 1.7 times larger than that of @xmath83 .",
    "as described above , assuming spherical symmetry and uniform density distribution , we obtain a typical radius of the central dust cavity in the compact h ii regions , 0.3 times strmgren radius .",
    "this corresponds about 40 % of the ionized radius and about 0.3 pc .",
    "we discuss the formation mechanism and the detectability of the cavity .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that since real h ii regions , even compact or ultra - compact regions , show a complex structure , the radius of a real cavity may be different from 0.3 pc obtained by our model .",
    "three formation mechanisms of the central dust cavity are naturally expected : ( 1 ) radiation pressure , ( 2 ) stellar wind by the central source , and ( 3 ) dust sublimation .",
    "here we discuss whether the above mechanisms can produce the cavity and which is more effective .",
    "the effect of radiation pressure of the central source on the distribution of gas and dust in h ii regions is discussed in detail by @xcite . according to them",
    ", the radiation force acting on the dust grain produces the central cavity of dust and gas ( see their fig.7 ) .",
    "the radius of the cavity is about 20 % of the ionized radius .",
    "although we can not directly compare their cavity s radius with that in this paper because of the difference between the adopted parameter sets , the radiation pressure can produce a large cavity .",
    "also , strong stellar wind of the massive stars must contribute to produce the central cavity .",
    "indeed , the central low density cavity of gas is produced by the stellar wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since dust and gas",
    "are well coupled with each other @xcite , the gas cavity indicates the dust cavity .",
    "unfortunately , we can not estimate quantitatively the contribution of the stellar wind to form the dust cavity here .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we will resolve which of radiation pressure and stellar wind is dominant mechanism to form the cavity in our future work .",
    "how about the effect of dust sublimation ?",
    "indeed , dust grains may sublime in h ii regions because of the strong radiation from the central source .",
    "however , the radius of the dust cavity caused by the dust sublimation is about @xmath118 pc @xcite .",
    "this is too small to produce the large cavity expected here .",
    "thus , the dust sublimation is not dominant mechanism to form the dust cavity .",
    "in addition , we discuss the effect of the clumpy distribution of dust . under the clumpy distribution , which is more realistic than the smooth",
    "one adopted here , we may reproduce the ionizing photon fraction determined from observational data even if the dust clumps exist in the central area of h ii regions .",
    "however we consider that there is also the central cavity under the clumpy distribution .",
    "this is because the radiation pressure and stellar wind will blows out the dust clumps from the central area .",
    "we note that the expected radius of the cavity in clumpy medium may become smaller than the determined one in the previous section .",
    "such effect of the clumpiness should be clarified in our future work .      as stated by @xcite , the best observational test of the dust cavity model is fir ( or submillimeter ) observations with high angular resolution .",
    "assuming a spherical and uniform structure , we expect that the dust cavity s radius is about 0.3 pc for our sample of the galactic compact h ii regions .",
    "it corresponds to about @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the distance to the region from us . here",
    ", we examine the detectability of such dust cavity of compact or ultra - compact h ii regions by the present and future ir facilities .",
    "the future ir observational satellite of japan , astro - f ( _ iris _ ; infrared imaging surveyor ) is planned to launch in 2004 by the institute of space and astronautical science of japan",
    ". it will offer modest angular resolutions of @xmath121@xmath122 at 50200  @xcite . we may detect the dust cavity of h ii regions located within only about 1 kpc from us .",
    "however , astro - f will survey the whole of the sky , fortunately .",
    "thus , we may detect many such closest cavities .",
    "sirtf , which is the major upcoming ir satellite planned to launch in july 2002 by nasa , offers much higher angular resolutions of @xmath123@xmath124 at 24160 .",
    "if we observe the emission from dust being thermally equilibrium with ambient gas , the super resolution mode at 70 , which provides us with @xmath125 angular resolution , is the most suitable . by this observing mode",
    ", we can detect the dust cavity of h ii regions within about 12 kpc from us , i.e. almost all h ii regions in our galaxy .",
    "therefore , sirtf will resolve the dust cavity , and clarify the dust distribution in h ii regions in detail .",
    "we may also detect the dust cavity at submillimeter .",
    "for example , scuba provides us with much higher angular resolution , @xmath126 at 450 , or @xmath127 at 850 .",
    "@xcite observed the galactic ultra - compact h ii regions by scuba , and present high resolution images of them .",
    "@xcite also present high resolution images of the ultra - compact h ii regions obtained by caltech submillimeter observatory . however , we can not find the evidence of the cavity from their images .",
    "this may be because the sample regions are ultra - compact , that is , their densities are very high , so that the radius of the cavity is very small .",
    "indeed , the estimated gas densities of their sample exceed about @xmath128 @xmath97 @xcite . for such high density region ,",
    "the strmgren radius is very small , less than 0.1 pc .",
    "it is corresponds to @xmath95 @xmath129 for the typical distance of their sample ( about 5 kpc ) .",
    "since the cavity s radius is less than the strmgren radius , the cavity can not be resolved by their observations .",
    "if we select some nearby spherical compact h ii regions , whose gas densities are about @xmath130 @xmath97 , as the targets , we may detect the dust cavity by scuba .",
    "we examine a possible distribution of dust grains in h ii regions . assuming the geometry with the central dust cavity , which is suggested theoretically and observationally in the literature",
    ", we can determine the cavity s radius by using a simple transfer model of lyman continuum photons in a dusty spherical medium .",
    "we adopt the extinction law recently developed by @xcite , which is based on two components of grains , carbonaceous and silicate grains , and is a function of the ratio of visual extinction to color excess , @xmath46 .",
    "we assume @xmath83 , which is suitable for high density regions .",
    "in the transfer model , only one free parameter is included ; the radius of the dust cavity .",
    "the fraction of lyman continuum photons contributing to hydrogen ionization ( i.e. ionizing photons ) is adopted as a new constraint to determine the cavity s radius .",
    "the ionizing photon fractions of 13 compact or ultra - compact h ii regions in the galaxy are determined from the ratio of infrared to radio fluxes via the method developed by us recently ( paper i and ii ) .",
    "its mean is 0.55 .",
    "it is consistent with our previous results ; a half of lc photons is absorbed by dust before they ionize the neutral hydrogen .",
    "we examine the effect of various quantities on the relation between the ionizing photon fraction and the dust cavity s radius . setting a fixed radius of the cavity ,",
    "we find that the ionizing photon fraction decreases as the ionization parameter increases .",
    "also we find that the fraction decreases as the value of @xmath46 decreases or as electron temperature increases .",
    "we determine the dust cavity s radius of individual sample region so as to reproduce the fraction of ionizing photons estimated from observational data by the transfer model .",
    "the mean determined radius of the dust cavity is 0.39 times strmgren radius for all of the sample .",
    "we divide our sample into two subsamples : one is the ultra - compact sample , and the other is the compact sample . our classification is based on the strmgren ( or ionized ) radius of the sample regions , and is consistent with that of @xcite based on the gas densities .",
    "a typical radius of the dust cavity for the compact sample is @xmath113 in units of the strmgren radius , where the error includes both uncertainties of the individual estimate and the variation among sample regions .",
    "this corresponds to about 40% of the ionized radius and about 0.3 pc .",
    "also , a typical cavity s radius for the ultra - compact sample is @xmath114 in units of the the strmgren radius , which corresponds to about 60% of the ionized radius and about 0.2 pc .",
    "since the uncertainties of these values are somewhat large and the ultra - compact sample consists of only three regions , it is uncertain whether the difference of the cavity s radius between two subsamples is real and indicates an evolutionary sequence of h ii regions . in any case , we can reject the dust distribution without the central cavity with the significance level about 0.001% for both samples .",
    "thus , we conclude that the model nebula filled with dust uniformly is invalid in order to explain the ionizing photon fraction .",
    "the dust cavity model is supported independently of the previous works .",
    "we discuss the formation mechanism of the dust cavity .",
    "although the radiation pressure and stellar wind by the central source can produce the central cavity , it is uncertain which is dominant mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "the dust sublimation process is not a major mechanism to form the cavity .",
    "this is because the expected cavity s radius by the sublimation process is too small to explain that obtained by us .",
    "we discuss the detectability of the dust cavity by present and future infrared  submillimeter facilities .",
    "sirtf is the most powerful facility to detect the cavity .",
    "indeed , we expect that sirtf can detect the cavities in almost all h ii regions of our galaxy .",
    "scuba can also detect the cavities if we select nearby ( typically @xmath95 5 kpc ) spherical compact h ii regions , whose gas densities are about @xmath130 @xmath97 , as the targets .",
    "moreover , japanese ir satellite , astro - f can detect the cavities in h ii regions located within only 1 kpc from us . since astro - f surveys the whole of the sky",
    ", we may detect a lot of closest h ii regions with the central cavity .",
