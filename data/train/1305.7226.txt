    ", reheating the cold universe at the end of primordial inflation is more of a challenge . in many models",
    ", inflation must be followed by a long phase in which the inflaton oscillates at the bottom of its potential , slowly transferring its energy to the rest of the universe , to which it is only weakly coupled .",
    "although the old theory of reheating @xcite works , there has always been a desire to reheat the universe more efficiently , hence , achieving a large reheating temperature . one popular way to accomplish",
    "this is _ pre_heating , whereby classical field effects @xcite quickly and efficiently transfer the inflaton energy to matter fields via three- or four - leg interactions despite weak couplings and small decay rates .    in a typical preheating scenario ,",
    "the inflaton @xmath1 couples @xmath2 to another scalar field @xmath3 whose mass is assumed to be small compared to the expansion rate .",
    "the oscillation of the inflaton amplifies particular modes of @xmath3 , akin to the way a child pumping her legs amplifies the harmonic motion of a playground swing .",
    "this driven instability creates strong inhomogeneities in both @xmath3 and @xmath1 , whereafter it is generally assumed that the @xmath3 and @xmath1 particles decay into the ultra - relativistic species of the standard model .",
    "this is the largest success of preheating ; it is the mechanism through which the universe heats up to create the hot big bang .",
    "unfortunately , most models of preheating , the universe is still looks matter - dominated at the end of the resonance period before thermalization takes place .",
    "moreover , these same models leave us with few observational signatures .",
    "it is likely that the only observable consequence is in the form of a stochastic gravitational wave background @xcite whose signal will be very difficult to detect unless inflation occurred at a very low scale .",
    "in this manuscript we study the intriguing possibility that the fields that undergo preheating are massless gauge fields .",
    "we use electromagnetism with a dilaton - like coupling to the inflaton that breaks conformal invariance as the basis of our model , though more complicated gauge fields may also be considered , e.g. @xcite .",

    "furthermore , it has recently been demonstrated that fluctuations of the inflaton are correlated with the large - scale magnetic field as a result of the coupling in our model @xcite .",
    "hence , a residual cross correlation in the large scale pattern of inhomogeneities in the sky may provide a signal as to the mechanism of preheating .    in our model ,",
    "a single scalar degree of freedom , @xmath1 , is responsible for inflation and is coupled to electromagnetism via @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are scalar functions and represent the coupling strength and the inflationary potential respectively .",
    "although we identify the @xmath0 gauge field with the usual electromagnetic field , there is no explicit need that this be the case .",
