    "the evolution of single - particle states when moving away from double shell closures has long been a subject of primary interest in nuclear structure physics .",
    "it was in the early 1960s @xcite , in fact , that quantitative experimental information on this subject started to become available thanks to the study of one - nucleon transfer reactions such as ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) and ( @xmath4,@xmath6 ) . during the 1960s and early 1970s the field developed rapidly and spectroscopic factors",
    "were extracted from pickup and stripping reactions for many nuclei . in particular , the stable sn isotopes and @xmath7 isotones were the subject of extensive studies @xcite which provided relevant information on the shell - model structure of these nuclei . by the end of the 1970s , however , most of the feasible experiments had been performed and the study of transfer reactions began loosing its role as a most powerful tool for the understanding of nuclear structure .    as it was to be expected ,",
    "the advent of radioactive ion beams ( ribs ) has opened a new era for the study of transfer reactions , which is currently recognized as one of the major research themes to be pursued at the second - generation rib facilities .",
    "a main feature of transfer reactions with ribs is that they have to be performed in inverse kinematics .",
    "this is for instance the case of the @xmath3sn(@xmath4,@xmath5 ) reaction recently performed at the first - generation rib facility at oak ridge national laboratory @xcite .",
    "this experiment allowed to investigate the single - particle structure of the one - valence neutron nucleus @xmath8sn , and the spectroscopic factors for the ground and three excited states extracted from the differential cross sections turned out to be very close to one .",
    "this is a remarkable achievement which has set the stage for future studies of neutron - rich nuclei in the @xmath3sn region , which are also of great interest for modelling the @xmath9 processes of nucleosynthesis .    in this context , it is worth mentioning that it is also of current interest the study of transfer reactions with stable beams in inverse kinematics to test new detectors specifically designed for use with heavy beams .",
    "a recent notable example of this kind of study is the @xmath10xe ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) reaction performed at the atlas facility at argonne national laboratory @xcite , which has provided a stringent test of the helios spectrometer used to analyze the outgoing protons .",
    "the experimental studies of nucleon transfer reactions currently going on and the bright perspectives for future research with ribs are of course a great stimulus for theoretical studies aimed at understanding the evolution of single - particle states .",
    "this is indeed the case of our very recent shell - model study @xcite of the single - neutron properties of @xmath1xe , which received motivation from the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite .    based on the results obtained in @xcite ,",
    "we have found it very interesting to perform a similar study for other nuclei beyond @xmath3sn which are within reach of ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) transfer reactions with ribs .",
    "more precisely , we consider the two one valence - neutron isotones @xmath0te and @xmath1xe and the two one valence - proton isotopes @xmath2sb . actually , results for @xmath1xe have already been given in @xcite , where we essentially focused on the comparison between our spectroscopic factors and those reported in  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is of more general scope , in that we study how the single - particle states of @xmath8sb and @xmath8sn are modified by the addition of pairs of neutron and protons , respectively .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give an outline of our calculations . in sec .",
    "iii the results for the energies and spectroscopic factors are presented and discussed in detail . in sec .",
    "iv we present our predicted effective single - particle energies and discuss their evolution .",
    "v contains a summary of our conclusions .",
    "the results presented in this section have been obtained with the same hamiltonian used in our previous shell - model studies of neutron - rich nuclei beyond @xmath3sn @xcite . in this hamiltonian ,",
    "the single - particle energies are taken from experiment while the two - body effective interaction is derived within the framework of perturbation theory  @xcite starting from the cd - bonn @xmath11 potential @xcite renormalized by way of the @xmath12 approach  @xcite .",
    "some details on the calculation of this two - body interaction can be found in @xcite .",
    "we discuss here only the choice of the single - particle energies that may be relevant to the discussion of our results .",
    ".single - proton and -neutron energies ( in mev ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ espep ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we see that all the neutron and proton espes go down when pairs of nucleons are added . however , the decrease in energy is not the same for the various levels leading to single - particle spectra substantially different from those of the one valence - particle nuclei .",
    "for instance , the five neutron espes above the lowest one tend to lie in a smaller energy interval , the @xmath13 spacing reducing from the initial value of 700 to 100 kev in @xmath1xe . on the other hand ,",
    "the spacing between the lowest and the highest proton levels remains practically unchanged while the three other levels move toward the @xmath14 with an overall downshift of about 500 kev in @xmath1sb .    in this context",
    ", it should be mentioned that the evolution of shell structure has received great attention in recent years owing to new available data on exotic nuclei , which have evidenced the appearance or disappearance of magic numbers .",
    "several theoretical studies have then been carried out to try to identify the mechanism behind the variation of single - particle energies .",
    "in particular , the role of the monopole components of the spin - isospin and tensor interaction has been pointed out , the latter producing an attractive / repulsive effect for two unlike nucleons with opposite / aligned spin orientation  @xcite . by using the spin - tensor decomposition of the interaction ,",
    "the interplay between the tensor force and other components of the neutron - proton interaction has been investigated  @xcite .",
    "this has provided evidence for the importance of both the central and tensor force in determining the evolution of espes , the latter playing a dominant role for the energy difference of spin - orbit partners .",
    "it would be clearly desirable to perform such a decomposition also in the present study to clarify how the behavior of the espes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is related to the various terms of our effective interaction .",
    "this is , unfortunately , not feasible since our shell - model space , on which the interaction is defined , does not contain for each orbital angular momentum the two spin - orbit partners .",
    "this is , in fact , a prerequisite to perform the spin - tensor decomposition .",
    "we can not therefore disentangle the effects of the central and tensor force , so as to unambiguously assess the role of the various terms of the effective neutron - proton interaction in determining the evolution of the espes .    from tables",
    "[ espen ] and [ espep ] , however , we see that for each pair of neutron / proton spin - orbit partners the monopole matrix element corresponding to the orbit with opposite spin orientation relative to proton @xmath14/neutron @xmath15 is the most attractive .",
    "this accounts for the variation in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 neutron spacings , as well as in the @xmath18 proton one , and may be traced to the effect of the tensor component of our effective interaction @xcite .",
    "we also predict a significant decrease in the neutron @xmath19 spacing , which comes essentially from @xmath20 being more attractive than @xmath21 .",
    "the less attraction of the latter may be again attributed to the tensor force , the neutron @xmath22 orbit , unlike the @xmath23 one , being spin - down as the proton @xmath14 orbit @xcite . in this connection",
    ", it is worth mentioning that this force has been shown to be responsible of the reduction in the separation of these two orbits in the @xmath24 isotones @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have performed shell - model calculations for the four neutron - rich nuclei @xmath0sb , @xmath1sb , @xmath0te and @xmath1xe .",
    "the main aim of our study was to follow the evolution of the single - proton and -neutron states outside doubly magic @xmath3sn when adding neutron and proton pairs , respectively .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in our calculations we have consistently employed the same hamiltonian which has given a very good description of other nuclei beyond @xmath3sn @xcite without use of any adjustable parameters .",
    "we have calculated energies , spectroscopic factors and effective single - particle energies for states of all the four nuclei considered and compared our results with the available experimental data which are , however , rather scanty .",
    "in particular , no spectroscopic factors are available for @xmath0te and @xmath0sb while no spectroscopic information at all exists for @xmath1sb .",
    "this amounts to say that this study is largely predictive in nature and is meant to stimulate , and be of guide to , experimental efforts with ribs in the beyond @xmath3sn region .    of noteworthy interest",
    "is the stronger fragmentation of the single - particle strengths predicted for @xmath0sb and @xmath1sb as compared to that for @xmath0te and @xmath1xe .",
    "this stems essentially from the fact that the neutron pairing beyond @xmath7 is significantly smaller than the proton pairing beyond @xmath25 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that this difference in the proton and neutron effective interaction finds its origin in core - polarization effects .",
    "as shown in tables ii , iii and iv , our results are in very good agreement with the measured excitation energies in @xmath0te , @xmath0sb and @xmath1xe as well as with the spectroscopic factors extracted from the data for the latter .",
    "this makes us confident in the predictive power of our calculations .",
