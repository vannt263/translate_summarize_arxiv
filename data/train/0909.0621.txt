    "it is believed that single stars of solar metallicity with an initial mass of @xmath5 end their lives as wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( vanbeveren , de loore & van rensbergen 1998 ; meynet & maeder 2003 ) .",
    "the relatively small number of massive stars and the short duration of the wr phase ( @xmath6 myr ) makes the wr stars rare objects .",
    "the present total number of wr stars in the galaxy does not exceed several thousands ( e.g. shara et al .",
    "1999 ; van der hucht 2001 ) . the known population of wr stars is , however , an order of magnitude less numerous ( van der hucht 2006 ) .",
    "the large disparity between the expected and the observed number of wr stars is mostly caused by the huge interstellar extinction in the galactic plane , which strongly limits the traditional method for searching for wr stars using optical surveys . in this respect , the infrared ( ir ) observations are of high importance since the interstellar medium ( ism ) is much more transparent in the ir compared with the optical .",
    "the effectiveness of ir observations in identifying new wr stars was demonstrated by shara et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who carried out a near - ir narrow - band imaging survey of the inner galactic plane to select candidate wr stars and discovered 41 new wr stars in spectroscopic follow - ups ( cf .",
    "homeier et al .",
    "2003 ; hadfield et al .",
    "2007 ; mauerhan , van dyk & morris 2009 ) . another possible way to search for new wr ( and other evolved massive ) stars is through detection of their ( ir ) circumstellar nebulae , created after a massive star leaves the main sequence ( e.g. marston et al .",
    "1999 ; egan et al .",
    "2002 ; clark et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we report the discovery of a new wn8 - 9h star in cygnus via the detection of its ir nebula .",
    "we thereby add a new example to the known sample of late wn ( wnl ) stars with circumstellar nebulae ( e.g. esteban et al . 1993 ) .",
    "inspired by this discovery , we undertook an extensive search for similar objects using the archival data of the spitzer legacy programs and discovered many dozens of ring - like and bipolar ir shells ( gvaramadze , kniazev & fabrika 2009 ; cf .",
    "carey et al . 2009 ) .",
    "spectroscopic follow - ups of central stars associated with two dozens of the shells showed that they are either candidate luminous blue variables or related ( wnl , blue supergiant ) stars ( gvaramadze et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ; kniazev et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) , which confirmed that the ir imaging provides a powerful tool for revealing evolved massive stars via detection of their circumstellar nebulae .",
    "the nebula , which is the subject of this paper , was discovered serendipitously during our search for bow shocks around ob stars running away from star clusters in the cygnus x region ( for motivation of this search see gvaramadze & bomans 2008a ) .",
    "the nebula was detected in the archival data of the _ spitzer space telescope _",

    "fig.[fig : neb ] shows the mips @xmath7 m image of the nebula and its central star .",
    "the nebula has a clear ring - like structure with a diameter of @xmath8 arcmin and enhanced brightness along the west rim .",
    "the central star is offset for @xmath9 arcmin from the geometric centre of the nebula , being closer to the brightest portion of the nebula ( a possible origin of the nebula and its brightness asymmetry are discussed in section[sec : nebula ] ) .",
    "the cygnus - x spitzer legacy survey also provides irac @xmath10 m and mips @xmath11 m images of the field containing the nebula ; none of them shows its signatures .",
    "the optical counterpart to the central star was identified by dolidze ( 1971 ) as a possible wr star due to the presence in its spectrum of an emission band around @xmath12  .",
    "this star was included in the catalogue of h - alpha emission stars in the northern milky way ( kohoutek & wehmeyer 1999 ) as a candidate wr star ( named in the simbad database as [ kw97]44 - 47 or hbha4202 - 22 ) , but was not listed in the viith catalogue of galactic wolf - rayet stars ( van der hucht 2001 ) nor in the annex to this catalogue ( van der hucht 2006 ) .",
    "recently , corradi et al . ( 2008 ) put this star in the list of candidate symbiotic stars on the basis of its iphas and 2mass colours .",
    "to verify the nature of hbha4202 - 22 , we had performed spectroscopic observations with the russian 6-m telescope using the scorpio focal reducer ( afanasiev & moiseev 2005 ) in a long - slit mode with a slit width of 1 arcsec , providing a spectral resolution of 5  .",
    "the orientation of the ( 6 arcmin long ) slit is shown in fig.[fig : neb ] .",
    "the spectra were taken on two occasions : 2008 october 10 ( spectral range",
    "@xmath13   ) and 2008 november 11 ( spectral ranges @xmath13   and @xmath14   ) , and reduced using standard procedures .      using secondary photometric standards in the regions of symbiotic variable stars v407 cyg and as 323 published by henden & honeycutt ( 1997 )",
    ", we determined accurate magnitudes of four comparison stars near hbha4202 - 22 .",
    "the observations were carried out with the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ) 1-m zeiss reflector and @xmath15 photometer in the good photometric night on 2009 may 29 . the photometry accuracy is better than 0.02 mag .",
    "we have made expanded ccd standard star set of 18 stars to measure a dss poss-1 blue image .",
    "hbha4202 - 22 was measured using poss - o plate taken in the epoch of 1954.57 , ccd frames taken with the russian 6-m telescope in 2008.90 and ccd frames taken with sao 1-m zeiss telescope in 2009 .",
    "the results are given in table[tab : res ] .",

    "the model flux has been reddened and scaled to the distance according to the parameters given in table[tab : model ] . ]",
    "our proper motion measurements for wr138a ( section[sec : obs - prop ] ) showed that the star is moving in the west - southwest direction ( i.e. away from the galactic plane ) with a peculiar ( transverse ) velocity of @xmath4 ( for @xmath16 kpc ) , which is typical of runaway stars . in the galactic coordinates ,",
    "the components of the peculiar velocity are almost equal to each other : @xmath17 , @xmath18 .    assuming that the progenitor star of wr138a was born near the galactic plane and ejected from the parent star cluster soon after the birth",
    ", one has that the time it needs to reach the present height above the galactic plane , @xmath19 , should be @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the h - burning lifetime of the star . adopting the minimum plausible luminosity for wnl stars of @xmath22",
    ", one finds the current mass of wr138a of @xmath23 , which in turn implies the initial mass of the star of @xmath24 and @xmath25 myr ( e.g. meynet & maeder 2003 ) .",
    "thus , one has that @xmath26 myr ) @xmath27 , so that the star had enough time to reach its present location .    placing wr138a at , for example",
    ", @xmath28 kpc would result in a twofold increase of the stellar luminosity and in a increase of the present and initial mass of the star to , respectively , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in this case , @xmath31 myr @xmath32 myr .",
    "further increase of @xmath33 makes the discrepancy between @xmath34 and @xmath21 more severe",
    ". the discrepancy would be even more sever if the star spent several myr in the parent cluster before it was ejected ( gvaramadze & bomans 2008b ; gvaramadze , gualandris & portegies zwart 2009 ) . from this",
    "follows that the most likely initial mass of the progenitor star of wr138a was @xmath35 .",
    "one can not , however , exclude a possibility that the progenitor star was a blue straggler formed via merging of two less massive stars in the course of close binary - binary encounter , resulting in ejection of the merger product from the parent cluster ( e.g. gvaramadze & bomans 2008b ) . in this case , the distance to and the mass of wr138a could be larger .    the inference that wr138a is a runaway star",
    "could also be used to understand the origin of its ring nebula .",
    "a runaway wind - blowing ( e.g. wr ) star moving through the ism creates a highly elongated bubble ( weaver et al .",
    "1977 ; brighenti & dercole 1994 ) , whose shape in the upstream direction is determined by a ram pressure balance between the stellar wind and the ism ( baranov , krasnobaev & kulikovskii 1971 ) .",
    "the characteristic scale of the leading edge of the bubble is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the stellar mass - loss rate and the wind velocity , @xmath39 is the number density of the ambient medium , @xmath40 is the stellar peculiar velocity and @xmath41 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . for @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "( see table[tab : model ] ) , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( typical of the ism at @xmath46 pc ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) , one finds @xmath47 pc . the small size and the nearly circular shape of the nebula around wr138a ( at @xmath16 kpc , the linear radius of the nebula @xmath48 pc )",
    "imply that the stellar wind interacts with the dense ambient medium comoving with the star ( cf .",
    "lozinskaya 1992 ) .",
    "this consideration suggests that the immediate precursor of wr138a was a red supergiant ( rsg ) star ( i.e. the initial mass of the progenitor star was @xmath49 ; cf .",
    "section[sec : run ] ) and that the wr wind still propagates through the region occupied by the dense material shed during the rsg phase .",
    "according to stellar evolutionary models , a massive star with the initial mass in the range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 evolves through the sequence o @xmath52 rsg @xmath52 wn ( e.g. meynet & maeder 2003 ) . during the rsg phase",
    ", the star loses a considerable fraction of its initial mass in the form of slow , dense wind .",
    "the subsequent fast wr wind sweeps up the rsg wind and creates a circumstellar shell . for a spherically symmetric rsg wind ,",
    "the shell driven by the wr wind expands with a constant velocity ( e.g. chevalier & imamura 1983 ) @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are , respectively , the mass - loss rate and the wind velocity during the rsg phase . adopting @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( the figures typical of rsgs )",
    ", one has @xmath58 , which in turn gives us the dynamical age of the nebula @xmath59 yr .",
    "the latter estimate suggests that wr138a only recently entered the wr phase .",
    "the runaway nature of wr138a allows us to propose a natural explanation of the brightness asymmetry of the nebula and the offset of the star towards the brightest portion of the nebula .",
    "namely , we suggest that both are caused by the effect of the ram pressure of the ism , which affects the zone occupied by the rsg wind by making it denser and more compact ahead of the star . this suggestion could be supported by an estimate of the upstream ( minimum ) size of the zone occupied by the rsg wind , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 pc for the parameters adopted above ) @xmath62 , which shows that although the wr wind still propagates through the zone occupied by the rsg wind , it is already close to the edge of this zone to fill the density enhancement caused by the stellar motion .",
    "an additional support for our suggestion comes from the proper motion measurements for wr138a , which show that the star is moving in the direction implied by the above consideration .",
    "our interpretation of the nebula around wr138a as a circumstellar one ( i.e. created via the wind - wind interaction ) is consistent with the observational fact that small - scale ( circumstellar ) nebulae are predominantly associated with wnl stars ( e.g. lozinskaya & tutukov 1981 ; esteban et al .",
    "1993 ; barniske , oskinova & hamann 2008 ) , i.e. with young wr stars , whose winds interact with the material lost during the preceding evolutionary phases rather than with the ambient ism .",
    "the scarcity of circumstellar nebulae around wr stars suggests that they are visible on a time - scale much shorter than the duration of the wr phase .",
    "it is conceivable to associate this time - scale with the crossing - time of the region occupied by the rsg wind , i.e. @xmath63 yr , where @xmath64 pc and @xmath65 myr is the duration of the rsg phase .",
    "we have serendipitously discovered a ring nebula around a candidate wr star , hbha4202 - 22 , in cygnus using the mips @xmath7 m data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ archive .",
    "our spectroscopic follow - up confirmed the wr nature of this star and showed that it belongs to the wn8 - 9h subtype ( we named the star wr138a ) .",
    "we analyzed the spectrum of wr138a by using the potsdam wolf - rayet ( powr ) model atmospheres , obtaining a stellar temperature of 40kk .",
    "the stellar wind composition is dominated by helium with 20 per cent of hydrogen .",
    "the stellar spectrum is highly reddened and absorbed ( @xmath0mag , @xmath66mag ) . adopting a stellar luminosity of @xmath67 , the star has a mass - loss rate of @xmath68 , and resides in a distance of 4.2 kpc .",
    "we measured the proper motion for wr138a and found that it is a runaway star with a peculiar velocity of @xmath69 .",
    "the runaway nature of wr138a was used to constrain the initial mass of its progenitor star and to propose an explanation of the origin of its circular nebula .",
    "we found that the most likely initial mass of the progenitor star was @xmath70 ( i.e. the immediate precursor of wr138a was a rsg star ) and suggested that the nebula around wr138a is a circumstellar one , created via the interaction between the wr wind and the dense material shed during the preceding rsg phase .",
