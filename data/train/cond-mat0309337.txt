    "the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is a crucial problem in revealing the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "it is now generally agreed that hole - doped ( @xmath5-type ) high temperature superconducting cuprates have a @xmath6 pairing symmetry in the underdoped and optimally doped region @xcite while in the overdoped region a small component such as @xmath3 or @xmath7 appears in addition to the @xmath6 order parameter @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath6 wave symmetry in the low and optimally electron - doped ( @xmath8-type ) curtates has also been confirmed by the recent scanning squid @xcite , tunneling @xcite , arpes @xcite , penetration depth @xcite , and specific heat experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath3-wave symmetry is found to be dominant in the overdoped @xmath8-type cuprates @xcite , which is very different from the case of @xmath5-type ones .",
    "although there are significant differences between the @xmath5-type and @xmath8-type cuprates both in structure and in superconductivity , it is of general interest to see whether their behaviors can be explained within a unified physical picture . using the exchange of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations as the relevant pairing mechanism , manske _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have theoretically demonstrated the existence of the pure @xmath6 wave symmetry in underdoped @xmath8-type cuprates , they also successfully interpreted the well - known experimental facts such as the smaller t@xmath9 values of @xmath8-type cuprates than that of @xmath5-type ones , and why the superconductivity of @xmath8-type cuprates only occurs for a narrow doping range @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the electron - phonon coupling was introduced to explain the weakening of the @xmath6 pairing symmetry and the dominance of @xmath3-wave symmetry in overdoped @xmath8-type .",
    "that is , there may be some kinds of interactions coexisting and competing with each other .",
    "recently observed nodeless gap in nearly whole doping range of pr@xmath10ce@xmath11cuo@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) superconducting films @xcite also implicated that some order parameter may prevail over the others at some given conditions .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the electronic phase diagram and the superconduting mechanism of @xmath8-type cuprates in whole doping range , one of the essential tasks is to confirm the possible pairing symmetry other than @xmath6 type and investigate its properties in detail .",
    "the infinite - layer system sr@xmath14la@xmath15cuo@xmath2 is the simplest form of @xmath8-type cuprates .",
    "the recently synthesized single - phase samples of sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 have nearly @xmath16 superconducting volume @xcite , enabling reliable studies on its superconductivity .",
    "this system is of interest because of its three - dimensional superconductivity @xcite and it is expected to be a good candidate showing isotropic order paremeter .",
    "recently , its @xmath3-wave superconductivity has been proposed by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite and specific heat @xcite measurements separately .",
    "however , more detailed information is needed to clarify its pairing symmetry and superconducting mechanism .    in this work",
    "we study the quasiparticle tunneling spectroscopy of ptir / sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 point contacts .",
    "the @xmath3-wave pairing symmetry is demonstrated both by fitting the measured spectra to blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) theory and by investigating the field induced quasipartical states .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "it is noted that all the characteristics of superconductivity disappear completely at about 40k , therefore we construct the background of each spectral curve according to the functional form of the normal - state conductance ( at t=40k ) , as denoted by solid lines presented in fig .  [",

    "for the temperature higher than 20k , the spectra are badly smeared due to the thermal effect and surface roughness , therefore , it is difficult to obtain the credible fitting parameters .",

    "there are two possible reasons .",
    "one is the effect of disorder and the other is thermal smearing .",
    "we have examined these two effects in our data . as shown in fig.2 of ref.@xcite , when the zbcp is suppressed by an increase of disorder in the material ,",
    "the whole spectral curve becomes unfeatured , which is not the case in our work , i.e. , although there is no zbcp , the other characteristics of superconductivity are prominent .",
    "furthermore , the smearing effect is quantitatively investigated by introducing a smearing factor @xmath27 into the spectral calculations for @xmath6 symmetry . in such calculations ,",
    "we adopt the same potential model and formula presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the theoretical simulations of the spectra for two arbitrarily selected injection angles ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) , a typical modified btk fitting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) as a comparison .",
    "it is found that although the smearing factor @xmath27 is as large as @xmath30 of the maximal gap @xmath31 , the zbcp is still prominent .",
    "even the @xmath27-value is enhanced to 8mev which has been comparable to @xmath31 , the zbcp still exists for @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the depression of zbcp is accompanied by the remarkable weakening of all the spectral features .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the zbcp will become more pronounced when @xmath32 approaches to @xmath33 . considering the random orientations of the crystal grains ,",
    "if the pairing symmetry is @xmath6 type , the measured spectra may have remarkable difference from one position to the other and the zbcp should be easily observed at many grains .",
    "therefore , a fully gapped fermi surface should be responsible for the non - existence of zbcp in sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .     the experimental energy gap ( solid circles ) obtained from the fits described in fig .",

    "the bcs - type quasiparticle dispersion has recently been observed in bi-2212 by stm @xcite and in bi-2223 by arpes @xcite .",

    "therefore , any spectral variation caused by the change of vortex density can be detected when the applied magnetic field is altered . if the applied field does not change the configuration of the point contact , the background should be identical for the spectra measured at different fields . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](a ) , we can see the superposition of the high bias spectra for 0 t and 1 t , and this is also the case for 3 t and 5 t .",

    "]    it is found that the field induced conductance ( reflecting the vortex states ) has two common features for various temperatures .",
    "firstly , a zbcp occurs at low energy scale around fermi energy and enhances with increasing magnetic field ; secondly , at low field ( e.g. 1 t ) , the zbcp splitting is observed .",
    "these two features are opposite to that of vortex states in @xmath5-type cuprates @xcite , which has no zbcp due to the appearance of field induced orders such as antiferromagnetism @xcite and d - density wave @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the zbcp splitting has not been observed around the vortex core in conventional type - ii superconductors @xcite .",

    "is obtained at the center of the vortex cores and the split occurs when the distance between the vortices is large enough ( i.e. , at low field ) .",
    "although this model does not consider the coupling between cuo@xmath2 layers , its outcome is qualitatively consistent with our experimental results .     the comparison between the field dependence of the additional conductance in this work ( solid circles ) and that of low energy quasiparticle dos obtained from specific heat measurements ( open circles ) .",
    "the dotted line is the prediction for clean d - wave superconductors and the solid line has the form of @xmath37 . ]    in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , we present a set of field dependent spectra with the same background . as shown in the main frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , the field induced conductance ( reflecting vortex states ) has been determined by subtracting the zero - field spectrum from that measured in various fields .",
    "the zbcp splitting still can be recognized for the lowest field ( 1 t ) although the temperature is as high as 20k .",
    "it is known that the field induced quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) mostly comes from the exterior of the vortex cores for @xmath6 wave symmetry , while for @xmath3-wave symmetry the contribution from the interior of the cores is dominant .",
    "since the interface between the tip and sample is large enough as we have mentioned , we have measured the total field induced dos both the outside and the inside of the vortex cores .",
    "we have integrated the low energy additional conductance in a range of @xmath38mev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ( two other different integral ranges of @xmath39mev and @xmath40mev have also been selected and the obtained rules are the same as reported here ) . as a comparison",

    "the results reported here are in good agreement with the specific heat measurements , i.e. , the field induced low energy dos can be described as @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "it is well known that the exponent @xmath43 should be 0.5 for clean @xmath4-wave superconductors and 1 for @xmath3-wave superconductors in simple limit .",
    "however , @xmath43 may deviate these two values in the case of dirty @xmath4-wave @xcite or in the case of @xmath3-wave considering the vortex lattice effect @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite has ruled out the possibility of dirty d - wave and adopted that sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 is a s - wave superconductor , which is in good agreement with our forementioned conclusions .",
    "it should be pointed out that our result in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] is derived from the data measured at 20k which is higher than that ( @xmath44 ) in ref.@xcite . however , in the case of @xmath3-wave symmetry , the field dependence of additional dos is mainly determined by the density of vortices instead of temperature .",
    "considering the much lower magnetic field than the upper critical field and t@xmath45k@xmath46k in our investigations , the conclusion presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] is reasonable and self - consistent .",
    "in summary , we have performed low - barrier quasiparticle tunneling measurements on the ptir / sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 point contacts in detail .",
    "no zbcp is observed on the randomly oriented crystal grains .",
    "all the normalized conductance spectra can be well fitted in the frame of btk theory , providing an impelling evidence for the bsc - type s - wave superconductivity in sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "this is also proved by investigating the magnetic field induced vortex states .",
    "however , it is noted that the temperature dependence of superconducting gap deviates from the prediction of conventional electron - phonon coupling mechanism , and the field induced zbcp is splitted at low field .",
    "these features can not be interpreted in the frame of conventional superconducting mechanism , therefore , cautious must be taken to associate the experimentally observed @xmath3-wave superconductivity in overdoped @xmath8-type cuprates with the electron - phonon mechanism .",
