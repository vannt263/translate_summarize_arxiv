    "thermodynamic properties of highly excited ( hot ) nuclei have been a topic of much interest in nuclear physics . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", thermodynamic properties of any systems can be studied by using three principal statistical ensembles , namely the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , canonical ensemble ( ce ) and microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) .",
    "the gce is an ensemble of identical systems in thermal equilibrium , which exchange their energies and particle numbers with the external heat bath . in the ce , the systems exchange only their energies , whereas their particle numbers are kept to be the same for all systems .",
    "the mce describes thermally isolated systems with fixed energies and particle numbers . for convenience ,",
    "the gce is often used in most of theoretical approaches , e.g. the conventional finite - temperature bcs ( ftbcs ) theory @xcite , and/or finite - temperature hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory @xcite .",
    "these theories , however , fail to describe thermodynamic properties of finite small systems such as atomic nuclei or ultra - small metallic grains .",
    "the reason is that the ftbcs neglects the quantal and thermal fluctuations , which have been shown to be very important in finite systems @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations smooth out the superfluid - normal ( sn ) phase transition , which is a typical feature of infinite systems as predicted by the ftbcs theory .",
    "because an atomic nucleus is a system with the fixed particle number , the particle - number fluctuations are obviously not allowed .",
    "the use of the gce in nuclear systems is therefore an approximation , which is good so long as the effect caused by particle - number fluctuations are negligible .",
    "the ce and mce are often used in extending the exact solutions of the pairing hamiltonian @xcite to finite temperature , whereas the ce is preferred in the quantum monte - carlo calculations at finite temperature ( ftqmc ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is impracticable to find all the exact eigenvalues of the pairing hamiltonian to construct the exact partition functions for large systems .",
    "for instance , in the half - filled doubly - folded multilevel model ( also called the richardson model ) with @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the number of single - particle levels and @xmath6 - the number of particles , this can not be done already for @xmath7 14 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the ftqmc is quite time consuming and can not be applied to heavy nuclei unless a limited configuration space is picked up .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the pairing hamiltonian can also be solved exactly by using the richardson s method , i.e. solving the richardson equations . using this method ,",
    "the lowest eigenvalues of the pairing hamiltonian can be obtained even for very large systems , e.g. with @xmath8 = 1000 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    ". nonetheless , these lowest eigenstates ( obtained after solving the richardson equations ) are not sufficient for the construction of the exact partition function at finite temperature since the latter should contain all the excited states , not only the lowest ones . in principle , the ce - based approaches can also be derived from the exact particle - number projection ( pnp ) at finite temperature on top of the gce ones @xcite",
    ". however , this method is rather complicated for application to realistic nuclei .    the static path plus random phase approximation ( spa + rpa ) with the exact number parity projection cspa(_p _ )  @xcite and the latter extension of the number projected spa ( npspa )  @xcite offer quite good agreement with the exact ce of the richardson model as well as the empirical heat capacities of heavy nuclei .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite makes no comparison with experimental data , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite uses a thermal pairing gap , which is obtained from a direct extension of the odd - even mass difference to finite temperature . as has been pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite such simple extension fails in the region of intermediate and high temperatures . in principle , the spa can also be used to evaluate the mce quantities based on the gce ones by fixing the energy and particle number of the system  @xcite .",
    "however this method is still quite complicated for practical applications to realistic nuclei , especially the heavy ones . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the ce and mce are usually used to extract various thermodynamic quantities of nuclear systems .",
    "this is carried out by using the nuclear level density , which can be experimentally measured at low excitation energy @xmath9 10 mev . within the ce ,",
    "the measured level densities are first extrapolated to high @xmath10 using the back - shifted fermi - gas model ( bsfg ) .",
    "the ce partition function is then constructed making use of the laplace transformation of the level density . knowing the partition function",
    ", one can calculate all the thermodynamic quantities within the ce such as the free energy , total energy , heat capacity and entropy .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities of the systems obtained within the mce are calculated via the boltzmann s definition of entropy .",
    "although several experimental data for nuclear thermodynamic quantities extracted in this way by the oslo group have recently been reported @xcite , most of present theoretical approaches , derived within the gce , can not describe well these data , which are extracted within the ce and mce .",
    "recently we have proposed a method , which has allowed us to construct theoretical approaches within the ce and mce to describe rather well thermodynamic properties of atomic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the proposed approaches are derived by solving the bcs and self - consistent quasiparticle rpa ( scqrpa ) equations with the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) pnp for each total seniority @xmath11 ( number of unpaired particles at zero temperature )  @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are then embedded into the ce and mce . within the ce ,",
    "the resulting approaches are called the ce - lnbcs and ce - lnscqrpa , whereas they are called the mce - lnbcs and mce - lnscqrpa within the mce .",
    "the results obtained within these approaches are found in quite good agreement with not only the exact solutions of the richardson model but also the experimentally extracted data for @xmath12fe isotope .",
    "the merit of these approaches reside in their simplicity and feasibility in the application even to heavy nuclei , where the exact solution is impracticable and the ftqmc is time consuming .",
    "the goal of present article is to apply the above - mentioned approaches to microscopically describe the recently extracted thermodynamic quantities of @xmath13mo , @xmath2dy and @xmath3yb nuclei .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",

    "the subscripts @xmath17 here imply the single - particle states in deformed basis .",
    "this hamiltonian describes a system of @xmath6 particles ( protons or neutrons ) interacting via a monopole pairing force with constant parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the pairing hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly by using the su(2 ) algebra of angular momentum @xcite . at finite temperature @xmath19",

    "the peak in the experimental heat capacity near @xmath76 0.4 mev is seen in @xmath3yb , whereas it disappears in @xmath2dy .",
