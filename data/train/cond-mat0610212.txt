    "the rich physics specific for boundary regions between superconducting and ferromagnetic materials has recently been probed in a series of experiments @xcite . apart from confirming earlier theoretical predictions @xcite they provide deep insight into the coexistence of the two types of order and",
    "have inspired new ideas in the emerging field of spin electronics . in the boundary region the characteristic correlations known from the proximity effect in normal metals @xcite are induced , but in addition to the usual decay , they show an oscillating behavior @xcite .",
    "the length scales for decay and oscillations are set by the magnetic length @xcite .",
    "it is smaller than the decay length in a normal metal , for ballistic systems by the ratio between temperature and exchange energy , @xmath0 , and for diffusive systems by the factor @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to modifications of the density of states@xcite and the josephson effect through ferromagnets.@xcite for usual ferromagnets @xmath2 is considerably larger than @xmath3 , and the proximity effect is hard to observe .",
    "a breakthrough came with the advance of dilute ferromagnetic alloys with rather low spin polarization , such as pd@xmath4ni@xmath5 or cu@xmath4ni@xmath5 , where magnetic ni ions are integrated into a non - magnetic matrix .",
    "a high level of control has been reached with heterostructures containing such `` weak '' ferromagnets ( low spin polarization ) .",
    "e.g. , it became possible to spatially resolve properties on the scale of the magnetic length and to observe the proximity effect@xcite .    in parallel",
    ", it remained an important goal for the further development of spin electronics to create and investigate heterostructures@xcite where `` strong '' ferromagnets with large exchange splitting of the bands and high spin polarization are in contact with superconductors . in the extreme case , for so - called half - metallic materials",
    ", the polarization reaches values close to 100  % .",
    "half metals are metallic in one spin direction with respect to a certain spin quantization axis , and semiconducting or insulating in the other .",
    "in the course of this research a so - called `` long - range proximity effect '' was discovered @xcite , which is governed by a length scale typical of the proximity effect in a normal metal , rather than the magnetic length of the ferromagnet involved .",
    "such long - range proximity amplitudes have their origin in the mixing between singlet and triplet pair amplitudes inherent to pairing in the presence of broken spin - rotation symmetry.@xcite triplet correlations are classified according to their projection on the spin quantization axis that renders the quasiparticle bands in the ferromagnet diagonal .",
    "there are three corresponding amplitudes , @xmath6 . of those the equal spin pair amplitudes , @xmath7 ,",
    "lead to the long - range proximity effect , as pairing occurs within the same spin band and is unaffected by the large exchange energy @xmath2 .",
    "this explains the penetration of triplet pair amplitudes into the ferromagnet , once they are created @xcite .",
    "however , the questions how they are created in the first place and what are their magnitudes remain active research topics @xcite .",
    "the creation mechanisms for pairing correlations inside the ferromagnet differ in the ballistic limit significantly for weak and strong ferromagnets . for the following discussion we will concentrate on singlet superconductors . in the case of a weak ferromagnet the singlet superconductor induces in the first place a mixture of singlet and @xmath8 triplet pairs in the ferromagnet . both penetrate only on the short magnetic length scale , but various mechanisms may create long - range @xmath7 triplet components .",
    "examples are ( i ) a magnetic domain wall near the interface within a distance of the order of the magnetic length;@xcite or ( ii ) two ferromagnets with misaligned quantization axes separated by a singlet superconductor with a thickness of the order of the superconducting coherence length;@xcite or ( iii ) a spin - active interface that allows for spin - flip processes.@xcite in all cases , magnetic inhomogeneities mix the triplet pair components and create the long - range equal - spin pair amplitudes .    in the case of a strong ferromagnet",
    "the roles of the ferromagnet and the superconductor are reversed . here",
    ", in the first place the ferromagnet acts as a source for spin - polarization of cooper pairs in the superconductor .",
    "this results in a boundary layer with coexisting singlet and triplet amplitudes near the interface extending about a coherence length into the superconductor .",
    "the important mechanisms here are the spin - mixing terms@xcite ( often called spin - rotation ) in the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the surface scattering matrix .",
    "such spin - mixing effects arise as a consequence of the different matching conditions for spin - up and spin - down wave functions at the interface.@xcite consequently , the creation of triplet pair amplitudes is entirely the result of the interface properties , taking place in an interface region that is of similar size as the magnetic length .",
    "spin - mixing is most effective at interfaces with strong ferromagnets , increasing in strength with growing spin - polarization of the ferromagnet .",
    "long - range triplet components are created when spin - flip centers are present in the interface region .",
    "this mechanism even works in the presence of completely polarized ferromagnets , since the triplet correlations are created entirely within the superconductor , and only after their creation penetrate into the ferromagnet.@xcite in addition , the magnitude of the triplet correlations at the interface is proportional to that of the singlet amplitude at the interface , and both are insensitive to impurity scattering ( in contrast to the decay behavior away from the interface).@xcite    for intermediate spin polarizations the two creation mechanisms for triplet pairing , with strengths depending on microscopic details of the interface and domain wall structures in the ferromagnet , compete and are difficult to characterize theoretically .",
    "however , the two limiting cases of weak and strong spin polarization can be treated within a controlled approximation , namely the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity.@xcite it relies on a separation of two energy scales , the superconducting gap @xmath9 and the fermi energy @xmath10 , and can be extended to superconductor - ferromagnet heterostructures when the exchange energy @xmath2 lies either in the low- or in the high - energy range , corresponding to weak and strong ferromagnets , respectively . for weak ferromagnets",
    ", this means that fermi surface properties like the density of states at the fermi level in the normal state , @xmath11 , and the fermi velocity , @xmath12 , remain unchanged to lowest order in the small quasiclassical expansion parameter @xmath13 ; note that the magnetization in the normal state is a first order term in this parameter and is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the bohr magneton .",
    "on the other hand , for strong ferromagnets all effective interactions and indeed the quasiparticle band structure itself will be strongly modified by the presence of the exchange splitting .",
    "it is not possible a priory to describe the crossover between the two limits within quasiclassical theory .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in sec .  2 we describe how the pauli principle leads naturally to a classification of superconducting correlations according to their symmetries with respect to spin , momentum , and energy .",
    "we then show by two examples that all these types of correlations are indeed induced at superconductor - ferromagnet interfaces . in sec .",
    "3.1 we analyze the case of a weak ferromagnet in contact with a singlet superconductor through a spin - active interface barrier .",
    "we also illustrate the difference between the spatial dependences of short - range and long - range proximity amplitudes . in sec .",
    "3.2 we consider the case of a strong ferromagnet .",
    "in particular , we show results for the proximity effect between a singlet superconductor and a half - metal , and for a josephson junction involving a half metal .",
    "we show that an analytic treatment is possible for the case of small transmissions and a small spin - mixing angle .",
    "we find that in these limits , a previously discovered@xcite low - temperature anomaly in the critical josephson current is independent of the interface parameters , and is a direct consequence of the different symmetry properties of the pairing correlations compared to the case of a normal metal between two superconductors .",
    "there has been considerable work that formulated the physics of pairing correlations in diffusive ferromagnets in terms of one particular pairing component , that has odd - frequency , @xmath16-wave , equal - spin triplet symmetry.@xcite the question arises to which extend this component is important for systems with weak or intermediate impurity scattering .",
    "we will show in the following chapters that in fact four different symmetry components exist in ballistic heterostructures , and that they are comparable in size .",
    "we start with a general classification of pairing correlations .",
    "superconducting correlations are quantified by the anomalous green s function @xmath17 it is a matrix in spin space and depends on two coordinates and , in the matsubara technique , on two imaginary times .",
    "the pauli principle requires that this function changes sign when the two particles are interchanged , @xmath18 this well - known condition follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ agf ] ) and the anti - commutation relations for the field operators . for homogeneous systems",
    "@xmath19 depends only on relative coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 , i.e. it follows @xmath22 , and after fourier transformations @xmath23 for inhomogeneous systems this equation holds for each set of center coordinates .",
    "the symmetry restriction eq .",
    "( [ fsymm ] ) in spin , momentum @xmath24 , and matsubara frequency , @xmath25 , can be satisfied in four different ways , listed in table  [ table_symmetry ] .",
    "analytical continuation to the complex @xmath26-plane leads to @xmath27 ; in particular , retarded and advanced functions are related as @xmath28.@xcite    the spin part of eq .",
    "( [ fsymm ] ) can be divided up into singlet and triplet sectors @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the vector of the three pauli matrices .",
    "the singlet spin matrix @xmath31 is odd under the interchange @xmath32 , while the three triplet matrices @xmath33 are even .",
    "some insight about the symmetries in the momentum- and frequency - domains can be gained by considering the equal - time correlator.@xcite e.g. , for the spin - triplet case the pauli principle imposes that the following sum must vanish @xmath34 when the orbital part is odd the electrons avoid each other in real space , the equal - time correlator @xmath35 can be finite , and the correlator @xmath36 is even in frequency .",
    "on the other hand , when the orbital part is even , the correlator @xmath36 is odd in frequency , and electrons avoid each other in time .    .the",
    "pauli principle , requiring the pair correlation function to be an odd function under the exchange of two electrons , can be met by properties in spin , orbital , or frequency space as follows : [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the region @xmath37 of the ferromagnet the various components show different decaying behaviors depending on whether the pairing correlations involve two spin bands ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) or only one spin band ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the asymptotic form of the gamma function for @xmath41 is @xmath42 , and we can obtain simplified expressions for @xmath43 .",
    "we focus on the lowest matsubara frequency , for which @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",

    "note that there is a @xmath48 phase shift between the oscillations of the two components @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "also note that the trajectory resolved functions decay exponentially on the large coherence length scale @xmath49 , while the various harmonics decay as @xmath50 , before the exponential decay on the @xmath49 scale sets in at large distances ; the difference comes from the average over trajectories when projecting out the various harmonics . on the other hand , for the perpendicular triplets the asymptotic behavior",
    "is not reached until @xmath51 , and is of the form @xmath52 we plot in fig .",

    "for example , the case of a normal metal coupled to a superconductor is easily obtained from the above calculations and we recover for the case of a usual tunnel barrier ( no spin - active scattering ) the usual proximity effect @xcite .",
    "there is only a singlet component of the green s function and in the normal metal region it can be expressed in terms of partial waves as @xmath66^l q_l\\left(\\frac{2|\\epsilon_n|x}{v_f}\\right),\\ ] ] which for large distances from the interface @xmath51 decays as @xmath67 . above",
    "we introduced @xmath68 , the transparency of the interface within the tunnel cone ( here for simplicity chosen very wide @xmath69 as above ) .",
    "we see that higher partial waves @xmath70 are induced , as is always the case in inhomogeneous systems . in accordance with the pauli principle ,",
    "all odd components ( @xmath71 ) are odd in frequency .",
    "thus , both singlet entries ( types a and b ) in table  [ table_symmetry ] are always present in the usual proximity effect , and in fact in any inhomogeneous singlet superconducting state .",
    "analogously , the two triplet entries ( types c and d ) in table  [ table_symmetry ] are characteristic for any inhomogeneous triplet superconducting state .      in this section",
    "we analyze the various symmetry components , introduced in the previous sections , for the case of a superconductor coupled to a half - metallic ferromagnet .",
    "this case was previously studied on theoretical grounds , and a non - zero josephson - effect was predicted for a superconductor / half - metal / superconductor junction.@xcite the effect has recently been confirmed experimentally.@xcite in our previous article we focused on the @xmath72-wave triplet amplitudes , but it should be noted that there is also an odd - frequency @xmath16-wave triplet amplitude present in the half - metal .",
    "in fact , within our model all symmetry classes discussed in the previous chapter and shown in table  [ table_symmetry ] are present in the heterostructure . in the following",
    "we discuss the results for the clean case .",
    "we have performed calculations with impurity scattering ranging from the clean limit to the diffusive limit and have confirmed that both the even - frequency @xmath72-wave triplet and the odd - frequency @xmath16-wave triplet components are always present and important for the josephson current through the half metal.@xcite    the full scattering matrix for our model is a 3x3 matrix , where the three scattering channels are the two spin channels in the superconductor and one metallic spin channel in the half metal .",
    "the second spin channel in the half metal is insulating and is not participating actively in transport phenomena . as discussed in the introduction , quasiclassical theory is therefore applicable . to be specific , we parameterize the scattering matrix connecting incoming to outgoing waves in the superconductor ( @xmath73 ) and half - metallic ( @xmath74 ) sides as,@xcite @xmath75 where the extra phases of the transmission amplitudes ensure the unitarity of the scattering matrix , and the magnitudes are given by @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , with @xmath82 .",
    "the five real parameters of the scattering matrix above are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    in the following we derive analytic expressions for a well defined limiting case : the case of weak transmissions in all channels and small spin mixing angle . in the above scattering matrix",
    "this means that @xmath85 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are small .",
    "thus , in this limit the scattering matrix assumes the form , @xmath88    before presenting the results , we comment on the parameters in the scattering matrix . within our theory ,",
    "the scattering matrix is a phenomenological input that characterizes the scattering of quasiparticles near the fermi surface on either side of the interface of the system .",
    "microscopic details of the interfaces are irrelevant for the low - energy physics near the fermi surfaces .",
    "thus , all the parameters are assumed to be independent of energy , and only depend on the positions of the scattering momenta on the fermi surface .",
    "for strong ferromagnets , @xmath2 is not a small quantity , and consequently the scattering matrix has spin - active scattering terms of the order of @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the fermi energy . whereas the spin - mixing angle @xmath85 is a robust property of any interface to a strong ferromagnet",
    ", the spin - flip parameters @xmath91 , @xmath87 require the breaking of spin - rotation symmetry around the quantization axis of the ferromagnet .",
    "this can be the result of various mechanisms , for example the presence of interface regions with misaligned spin ( magnetic grain layers ) .",
    "the above mentioned parameters represent in this case averages over the grain configuration along the contact region of the interface for each given sample , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 numbers the different grains .",
    "thus , there are expected sample - to - sample variations in the spin - flip parameters unless the typical grain size exceeds the contact size .",
    "we now proceed with the derivation of analytic expressions for the various symmetry components of the pairing amplitudes . on the superconducting side of an interface with a half metal ,",
    "all four components listed in table [ table_symmetry ] are induced and can be calculated perturbatively in the small parameters @xmath85 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in the following",

    "the type b component only enters in second order in @xmath85 , and has the form @xmath99 .",
    "finally , the renormalization of the type a singlet component , @xmath100 , reduces the leading component only in second order in @xmath101 .",
    "consequently , to linear order in @xmath101 the self consistent singlet order parameter @xmath102 is not affected and stays constant up to the interface .",
    "all components , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath98 , and @xmath97 decay into the superconductor exponentially with a decay length given by @xmath105 .",
    "next we consider the equal spin pairing amplitudes in a symmetric josephson junction with a half metal of length @xmath106 extending from @xmath107 .",
    "on either side of the half metal are singlet superconductors having order parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
