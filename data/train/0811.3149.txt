    "numerous examples have been considered , but there are also a number of structural results , in particular the @xmath0-theorem of zamolodchikov @xcite that states that the central charge @xmath0 can not increase along renormalisation group flows , as well as the analogous @xmath1-theorem @xcite for the boundary entropy @xcite .",
    "perturbations of conformal field theories also play an important role in string theory , for example for time dependent backgrounds , see _ e.g.",
    "_  @xcite .    in the context of string",
    "theory also _",

    "most string theories of interest possess moduli , _",
    "i.e. _  free parameters such as the size and shape of the background or the position of some d - brane , and these correspond to marginal operators in the two - dimensional world - sheet theory .",
    "exact conformal field theory solutions are often only available at special points ( in particular the rational points ) in moduli space , and it is important to learn to control the theory away from these special points , _",
    "i.e. _  after perturbations by marginal operators .",
    "usually one thinks of the moduli as corresponding to _ exactly marginal _",
    "operators , and then the renormalisation group analysis is , by definition , trivial",
    ". however , in the context of bulk and boundary perturbations , the situation can be more subtle .",
    "in particular , exactly marginal bulk operators ( describing moduli of the closed string background ) can cease to be exactly marginal in the presence of a boundary .",
    "if this is the case , they induce a non - trivial renormalisation group flow on the boundary @xcite .    in the analysis of perturbations by relevant operators ,",
    "a first order analysis is usually sufficient ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . however , in the context of marginal perturbations , it is often necessary to go to higher order in perturbation theory .",
    "the simplest example of such a situation is a single neumann brane on a circle , for which the conformal dimension of the momentum eigenstates depends on the radius modulus . from the point of view of the world - sheet , the change in conformal dimension for",
    "this boundary operator does not arise at first order , but only appears at next - to - leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "higher order conformal perturbation theory also plays a role in proofs of integrability of particular bulk and/or boundary perturbations @xcite .",
    "conformal perturbation theory at higher orders was studied for particular models in @xcite ; general aspects of the pure bulk case were also discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we make an attempt at a systematic analysis of conformal perturbation theory beyond the leading order .",
    "we begin by analysing which rg coefficients are scheme - independent ( or universal ) and thus can have a physical interpretation .",
    "( in particular , we show that this is the case for the coefficient describing the change in conformal dimension of the momentum fields on the neumann brane . )",
    "we then outline a specific scheme  the position space minimal subtraction scheme  in which higher order rg coefficients can be calculated .",
    "this allows us to prove that the combined bulk - boundary perturbation problem is renormalisable at the quadratic order .",
    "while the minimal subtraction scheme is conceptually clean , explicit calculations of the rg coefficients are often rather cumbersome .",
    "we therefore also consider another , wilsonian type scheme , to which we refer to as the  ope scheme  since the first nontrivial terms in the beta functions are given by ope coefficients .",
    "this scheme has some conceptual shortcomings at higher orders but is computationally somewhat simpler . for the universal coefficients we are interested in",
    ", the result is independent of which of the two schemes we use ( as we also verify explicitly ) .",
    "we can therefore determine the coefficients of interest ( in particular the formula for the shift in conformal dimension for the momentum fields on the neumann brane ) in the wilsonian approach . in the resulting formulae",
    "the universal quantities are expressed as integrals over certain correlation functions . as an illustration",
    "we also apply the formulae to an intersecting brane model on a torus , and again reproduce the geometric result .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    "we discuss which rg coefficients in the boundary beta function are universal in the presence of marginal bulk perturbations ( section  2.1 ) .",
    "we then introduce the minimal subtraction scheme , both for pure boundary perturbations ( section  2.2.1 ) , as well as for the combined bulk - boundary problem for which we prove renormalisability at the quadratic order ( section  2.2.2 ) .",
    "we also introduce the wilsonian scheme and discuss its advantages and shortcomings ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "finally , we explain how the discussion can be generalised to include boundary changing operators ( section  2.4 ) . in section  3",
    "these ideas are applied to two examples , the single neumann brane on a circle ( section  3.1 ) , as well as a configuration of two intersecting d1-branes on a 2-torus ( section  3.2 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss in section  4 how our techniques for the calculation of higher order rg coefficients can also be applied to pure bulk or pure boundary perturbation theory .",
    "let us start with a general discussion of the effect of perturbations by marginal bulk operators on boundary degrees of freedom .",
    "generically such a deformation will induce a renormalisation group ( rg ) flow on the space of boundary conditions @xcite . under a certain condition , to be formulated precisely below , the induced boundary deformation is however scale independent to the first order in the bulk deformation parameter . in this case",
    "one can study how the set of boundary scaling dimensions changes with the bulk deformation .",
    "we will demonstrate that ( despite no occurrence of rg flows ) the rg technique is very useful in addressing this question .",
    "in particular we will derive , using the rg methods , general expressions for a first order change in dimensions of boundary operators along a bulk deformation .",

    "later we will generalise our discussion to superpositions of conformal boundary conditions .",
    "we will assume that the two point functions are normalised as @xmath9 in particular , this means that we assume all fields to be self - conjugate ; this is obviously not a real restriction , and our analysis can easily be generalised . the operator product expansion ( ope ) for pairs of bulk and",

    "the omitted terms stand for higher orders in the coupling constants .",
    "a general property of any local rg scheme is that the bulk beta functions are independent of the boundary couplings .",

    "the same scheme , to be discussed in more detail in section 2.3 , can be easily adapted for theories on the half plane .",

    "the resulting operator must coincide with the bulk operator @xmath27 , but in general extra subtractions may be required at the boundary .",

    "in conformal field theory the expansion ( [ multope ] ) always converges @xcite unlike in massive qfts for which the ope may be merely an asymptotic expansion . substituting ( [ multope ] ) into ( [ pert_gen ] )",

    "the divergences arising when @xmath71 operators come together first emerge at order @xmath80 in perturbation theory .",

    "the above discussion should however not be taken to be a recursive proof of renormalisability of conformal perturbation theory .",
    "one problem that needs to be tackled is the classical problem of overlapping divergences ; in the case at hand this occurs when @xmath71 points come together with a subset of @xmath89 points coming together much faster than the remaining ones .",
    "the associativity of the ope in conformal field theory should be the key property ensuring the consistency in dealing with overlapping divergences , but we have not attempted to work this out in detail .",
    "however , we will see in the concrete examples of the next subsections how the above discussion can be made more rigorous .",
    "in particular we will prove the renormalisability of conformal perturbation theory at the next - to - leading order using analytic properties of conformal blocks .    in order to illustrate these ideas ,",
    "let us now consider an integral that emerges at second order in perturbation theory , @xmath90 the product of the two boundary fields can be expanded via the ope ( [ boundaryboundaryope ] ) .",

    "another attractive feature is that formulae for universal quantities , such as the dimension shift ( [ dim_shift ] ) , can be obtained quite easily in contrast with the minimal subtraction scheme . on the other hand we will see at the end of this section that the scheme has some pitfalls when applied to computing non - universal quantities at higher order in perturbation theory .    in the ope scheme",
    "the theory is also regulated by a point - splitting cut - off @xmath52 , just as in the minimal subtraction scheme of the previous section .",
    "it is however convenient to introduce the infrared regulator slightly differently : we introduce a cut - off whenever two coordinates @xmath204 , @xmath205 are separated by a distance larger than @xmath61 , and whenever there is a bulk operator at a distance @xmath206 .",
    "the dimensionless couplings are now introduced by using the uv cut - off scale itself , which is understood as a fundamental uv scale ( lattice spacing , atomic or molecular scale ) .",

    "although the subtraction function @xmath396 still has a piecewise form it is expressed quite explicitly .      on the boundary the computation can be done in a similar way as in the bulk .",
    "we consider a boundary perturbation of the form @xmath397 where now @xmath398 .",
    "up to the third order in the couplings the rg equations take the form @xmath399 as before , we only introduce counterterms at the quadratic order for marginal or relevant fields , and the corresponding coefficients are @xmath400 where @xmath401 is the ope coefficient of two boundary fields ( [ boundaryboundaryope ] ) . in the resonant case where we have @xmath402",
    ", the coefficient @xmath403 can be written as @xmath404 by similar arguments as in the previous subsection we can find @xmath405 where @xmath406 here the conformal blocks @xmath407 have cuts running from @xmath129 to zero , and from @xmath130 to @xmath408 .",
    "in addition , their asymptotic behaviour is @xmath409 where @xmath274 is defined as before , _",
    "i.e. _   @xmath410 .",
    "finally , the scheme - independent quantity is given by @xmath411    in the case where several irreducible boundary conditions are involved , one has to keep track of their labels , and bear in mind the superselection rules , in particular the order of operators .",
    "this leads to additional splittings and recombinations of the integrals over four - point functions and subtractions .",
    "apart from this technicality , it is however straightforward to include the boundary labels .",
    "we have refrained from writing them explicitly to keep the formulae simpler .",
    "in this paper we have studied conformal perturbation theory beyond the leading order .",
    "we have shown that , at least up to quadratic order , the combined bulk boundary perturbation problem is renormalisable , using the minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "we also discussed the more commonly used ` wilsonian ' ope scheme , and found it to have some shortcomings at higher order in perturbation theory .",
    "we identified systematically the universal ( scheme - independent ) quantities , and gave explicit formulae for them at third order in terms of integrals of conformal 4-point functions . finally , we explained how essentially the same analysis works for the pure bulk and pure boundary case .",
    "it seems plausible that similar techniques should allow one to prove renormalisability at arbitrary order in perturbation theory , but we have not attempted to do so .",
    "our work was originally motivated by the question of how the dependence of the conformal dimension of a boundary changing field upon a bulk modulus can be understood from the world - sheet perspective .",
    "our considerations demonstrate that this effect is captured by a certain universal quadratic rg coefficient , for which we gave an explicit formula .",
    "this result should also have interesting applications in other contexts ; in particular , it provides a world - sheet method to study the stability of brane setups under arbitrary bulk deformations .",
