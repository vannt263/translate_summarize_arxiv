    "the discovery of a new particle  @xcite with properties compatible with those of a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson has strong implications for physics beyond the sm .",
    "in particular , the upper limit on the branching fraction of the higgs into invisible and/or undetected decay modes obtained from global fits to the higgs couplings  @xcite is a powerful probe of models with a light dark matter candidate .",
    "such dark matter candidates are motivated by hints of signals in direct detection experiments found by cogent  @xcite , dama  @xcite , cdms  @xcite and cresst  @xcite , although the interpretation of these results in terms of dark matter is challenged by negative results obtained by xenon  @xcite .",
    "hints of order 10  gev dark matter might also be present in indirect dark matter searches , as discussed in , , @xcite .",
    "more generally , light dark matter candidates are allowed in many of the popular extensions of the sm and it is therefore interesting to explore this possibility irrespective of the direct detection results .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , mssm ,",
    "several studies have shown that light neutralino dark matter with mass of order 10 gev can be compatible with collider data , in particular those from lep , provided one allows for non - universality in gaugino masses  @xcite .",
    "furthermore such light neutralinos can satisfy the recent constraints from b - physics observables , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , direct and indirect dark matter detection limits , as well as lhc limits , see  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the invisible decays of the higgs into a pair of neutralinos and the dark matter was explored before the discovery of the new boson , in the mssm with non - universal gaugino masses as well as in the general mssm ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the current precision determination of the relic density  @xcite and the possible constraints on the branching fraction of the higgs into invisibles make further investigations of this connection very interesting .",
    "the precise determination of the relic density puts particularly strong constraints on the light dark matter .",
    "indeed , the mostly bino - like lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) that is found in the mssm typically requires some mechanism to enhance its annihilation in order not to overclose the universe .",
    "possible mechanisms include @xmath4-channel @xmath5 or higgs exchange , or @xmath6-channel slepton exchange ( co - annihilation with sleptons is very much limited by slepton mass bounds from lep ) .",
    "for the higgs exchange to be efficient , one has to be close to the ( very narrow ) @xmath7 resonance , _",
    "@xmath8  gev .",
    "the @xmath5 exchange is efficient for lighter neutralinos , but requires a non - negligible higgsino component .",
    "hence @xmath9 and @xmath10 can not be too heavy . for @xmath6-channel slepton exchange",
    ", the sleptons must be light , close to the lep mass bound .",
    "the light neutralino scenario can therefore be further probed by searching directly for electroweak - inos and/or sleptons at the lhc  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we explore the parameter space of the mssm , searching for scenarios with light neutralinos that are consistent with all relevant collider and dark matter constraints .",
    "we extend on previous studies in two main directions : firstly , we take into account the current lhc limits on sleptons and electroweak - inos in an sms ( simplified models spectra ) approach  @xcite . secondly ,",
    "following @xcite , we include the fit to the properties of the observed 125126  gev higgs boson in all production / decay channels , and we consider implications of the light neutralino dark matter scenario for this higgs signal .",
    "these constraints were not taken into account in two recent studies  @xcite .",
    "another recent paper @xcite takes into account the most recent atlas limits from the di - tau plus @xmath11 searches  @xcite , but does not discuss implications for the higgs signal .    the setup of the numerical analysis is described in section  2 . in section  3 , we discuss the various experimental constraints that are included in the analysis .",
    "our results are presented in section  4 and conclusions are given in section  5 .",
    "the model that we use throughout this study is the so - called phenomenological mssm ( pmssm ) with parameters defined at the weak scale .",
    "the 19 free parameters of the pmssm are the gaugino masses @xmath12 , the higgsino parameter @xmath13 , the pseudoscalar mass @xmath14 , the ratio of higgs vev s , @xmath15 , the sfermion soft masses @xmath16 ( @xmath17 assuming degeneracy for the first two generations ) , and the trilinear couplings @xmath18 . in order to reduce the number of parameters to scan over , we fix a subset that is not directly relevant to our analysis to the following values : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "this means that we take heavy squarks ( except for stops and sbottoms ) and a moderately heavy gluino .",
    "all the strongly interacting susy particles are thus above current lhc limits .",
    "the parameters of interest are @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the higgs sector , the gaugino and higgsino mass parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath13 , the stop trilinear coupling @xmath27 , the stau parameters @xmath28 , and the slepton mass parameters @xmath29 .",
    "we allow these parameters to vary within the ranges shown in table  [ tab : scanrange ] .",
    "the only free parameter in the squark sector , @xmath27 , is tuned in order to match the mass of the lightest higgs boson , @xmath7 , with the newly observed state at the lhc .",
    ".scan ranges of free parameters .",
    "all masses are in gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in addition to the set of basic constraints , limits from searches for higgs bosons at the lhc are taken into account .",
    "the heavier neutral higgses , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are constrained by dedicated searches in the @xmath32 channel . for these",
    ", we use the most recent limits from cms  @xcite , given in the ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) plane in the @xmath35 scenario , which provides a conservative lower bound in the mssm  @xcite . of order 200  gev . ] the couplings of the observed higgs boson at around 125.5 gev , identified with @xmath7 , are constrained following the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _  making use of the information given in the 2d plane @xmath36 for each final state provided by the lhc experiments .",
    "these `` signal strengths ellipses '' combine atlas and cms results ( plus results from tevatron ) for the four effective final states that are relevant to the mssm : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "all the experimental results up to the lhcp 2013 conference  @xcite are included in the present analysis .",
    "the signal strengths are computed from a set of reduced couplings ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) that are computed with leading order analytic formulas , except for the couplings of the higgs to @xmath43 quarks , where loop corrections are included through @xmath44  @xcite . a given point in parameter space",
    "is considered as excluded if one of these four 2d signals strengths falls outside the 95% confidence level ( cl ) experimental region .",
    "regarding dark matter limits , the following constraints are applied : direct detection with the spin - independent limit from xenon100  @xcite and relic density from the combined measurement released by planck in ref .",
    "the calculation spin - independent scattering cross section depends on nuclear parameters ; we use @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47  mev and @xmath48  mev . for the relic density , multiple ranges are given in  @xcite ; we use the `` planck+wp+bao+highl '' best fit value of @xmath49 assuming a theory dominated uncertainty of 10% in order to account for unknown higher - order effects to the annihilation cross section .",
    "we will thus use @xmath50 as an upper bound or @xmath51 as an exact range .",
    "we also consider indirect detection limits from dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies ( dsphs ) released by fermi - lat based on measurements of the photon flux @xcite ; however , given that astrophysical uncertainties are still large and that current results do not strongly constrain scenarios of interest , we do not apply them to exclude parameter points but show the values of @xmath52 separately .      based on the latest data at @xmath53 , the atlas and cms experiments",
    "have performed a number of searches for sleptons and electroweak - inos in final states with leptons and missing transverse energy , @xmath11 .",
    "these have resulted in a significant improvement over the lep limits and therefore need to be taken into account .",
    "direct slepton production has been considered by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite in the @xmath54 channel ; here only limits on selectrons and smuons are currently available .",
    "electroweak - ino production is usually dominated by the @xmath55 process , which is searched for by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite in the trilepton + @xmath11 channel .",
    "the @xmath56 can decay either through an on - shell or off - shell @xmath5 or a slepton , while the @xmath57 can decay through an on - shell or off - shell @xmath58 or a slepton .",
    "the results of these searches are often interpreted by the experimental collaborations in the form of 95% cl upper limits on the cross sections times branching ratios , @xmath59 , for various sms topologies ( for a concise overview , see@xcite ) , and it is this sms approach that we use to implement lhc constraints in our analysis .",
    "a typical example is @xmath55 followed by @xmath60 and @xmath61 with 100% branching fraction . in this case , 95%  cl upper limits on @xmath59 are given in the @xmath62 plane .",
    "each scan point in the mssm parameter space , which survives the basic constraints as well as the higgs and dark matter constraints discussed above , is decomposed into its relevant sms topologies ( including the correct branching ratios ) and compared against the limits given by the experiments using the smodels technology , which will be described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a point is considered as excluded if one of the predicted @xmath59 exceeds the experimental upper limit , and allowed otherwise .",
    "this approach is conservative as it considers separately the signals coming from different susy particles that lead to the same final state .    in the present analysis ,",

    "iii ) _ @xmath66 from cms  @xcite , where @xmath67 can be a selectron , a smuon or a stau . note that the sms limits given by the experimental collaborations in terms of @xmath68 production apply for any @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ; @xmath71 ) combination .",
    "some more remarks are in order .",
    "first , for sms results involving more than two different susy particles , assumptions are made on their masses ( _ e.g. _  degeneracy of @xmath57 and @xmath56 or specific relations between the masses in cascade decays ) that are not always realized in the parameter space we consider .",
    "we allow up to 20% deviation from this assumption in the analysis .",
    "second , the results for electroweak - ino production with decay through intermediate sleptons depend on the fractions of selectrons , smuons and staus in the cascade decay .",
    "when chargino / neutralino decays into staus as well as into selectrons / smuons are relevant , we use the results for the `` democratic '' case from @xcite if the branching ratios into the three flavors are nearly equal ( within 20% ) , and those for the `` @xmath72-enriched '' case otherwise .",
    "moreover , the results are provided by cms for three specific values of @xmath73 ; we use a quadratic interpolation to obtain a limit for other @xmath74 values",
    ". however , many of the scenarios we consider have light staus and heavy selectrons and smuons , for which the `` @xmath72-dominated '' case applies .",
    "unfortunately , this has been provided by cms only for @xmath75 , corresponding to @xmath76 . to get a limit for different mass ratios ,",
    "we assume that the @xmath74 dependence is the same as in the @xmath72-enriched case ; we estimate that the associated uncertainty is about a factor of 2 , and we will flag the points affected by this uncertainty in the presentation of the results .",
    "note that , unfortunately , we can not use the atlas @xmath77 s + @xmath11 analysis  @xcite in this approach , as it interprets the results only as left - handed staus and only for @xmath78 .",
    "parameter points with left - handed staus which are likely to be constrained by this analysis ( _ i.e. _ , points satisfying @xmath79  gev and @xmath80 ) will also be flagged .",
    "finally , direct production of neutralino lsp s can only be probed through mono - photon and/or mono - jet events .",
    "limits from atlas and cms have been given in @xcite and interpreted as limits on spin - independent interactions of dark matter with nucleons .",
    "we do not take into account these limits since they can only be reliably interpreted in models where heavy mediators are responsible for the neutralino interactions with quarks .",
    "this is not the case in the mssm where the higgs gives the dominant contribution to the neutralino interactions with nucleons .",
    "let us now present the results of our analysis . figure  1 shows the effect of the dark matter constraints . here",
    ", the cyan points are all those which fulfill the `` basic constraints '' and also pass the limit on @xmath81 from cms @xcite ; blue points are in addition compatible at 95%  cl with all higgs signal strength measurements , based on the global fit of  @xcite ; red ( orange ) points obey moreover the relic density constraint @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and abide the direct detection limits from xenon100 on @xmath82  @xcite .",

    "we notice that typically the lhc limits reduce the density of points but do not restrict any further the range of masses that were allowed by the other constraints .",
    "the upper bound on the relic density imposes a lower limit on the neutralino mass of approximately 15  gev while the direct detection constraint does not modify the lower limit as will be discussed below .",

    "they will be further probed at the lhc at 1314  tev through searches for sleptons and electroweak - inos , as well as through a more precise determination of the higgs couplings . moreover , improving the spin - independent direct detection limits by an order of magnitude will cover the whole range of @xmath109 masses below @xmath143  gev .      while this letter was in preparation , ref .",
    "@xcite appeared with very similar conclusions as the ones reached here . while ref .",
    "@xcite features a better implementation of the limits from multi - tau plus @xmath11 searches , based on a reinterpretation of the atlas results  @xcite , it does not include or discuss implications for the higgs sector .",
    "another difference is that we consider a wider range of mssm scenarios ; in particular we include the possibility of light selectrons / smuons as well as of light winos .    moreover , just prior to publication , another paper  @xcite discussing the possibility of light neutralinos appeared .",
    "this work is complementary to ours as it concentrates on light neutralinos almost degenerate with light sbottoms which we do not consider .",
    "we thank u. laa , a. lessa , d. proschofsky - spindler and w. waltenberger for helpful discussions regarding simplified models spectra and for the possibility to use the smodels approach for this work .",
