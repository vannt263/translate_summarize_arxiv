    "windings of random walk trajectories are of considerable interest in various fields of condensed matter physics , from polymers and dna to superconductors and bose - einstein condensates ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper , we consider the influence of winding on the internal degrees of freedom of particles dynamics .",
    "note that winding dependent degrees of freedom are not exotic .",
    "the most obvious of these is , of course , the spin , which is of particular interest in view of the recent spintronic surge of activity . because of the spin - orbit interaction , the spin",
    "is directly related to the winding of particle trajectories .",
    "accordingly , our analysis is intimately related to the so - called spin hall effect in electron transport @xcite as well as to other types of spin transport , like , for example , photon ( light ) propagation in disordered media ( since photons also have non - zero spin ) .",
    "other degrees of freedom , both classical and quantum , can also be winding dependent , as e.g. geometric phases ( the berry phase ) .",
    "thus , the results of the present work are applicable not only to spin transport but also to any situation that can be reduced to random trajectories in a confined geometry with the dependence of certain characteristics on winding properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the concept of winding and the corresponding terminology .",
    "section 3 deals with the spin degree of freedom as directly dependent on a winding angle .",
    "section 4 contains numerical simulations in the case of diffusion in a rectangular 2d domain with periodic boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction and hard walls in the transverse direction .",
    "section 5 proposes a simple theoretical model of classical random walks with so - called `` soft walls '' , where the geometric constraints are described by an external confining potential in the transverse direction .",
    "section 6 contains a brief discussion of the results .",
    "let us introduce the winding angle @xmath0 as the vector sum of all the turnings of a particle trajectory @xmath1 .",
    "the angle is called the _ total curvature _ in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is given by the integral of the differential curvature over a natural parameter ( the local time of the trajectory ) .",
    "the differential curvature @xmath2 of the trajectory is defined as @xmath3 where the symbol `` @xmath4 ''  denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath5 and the symbol @xmath6 denotes the vector product .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath0 has the form @xcite @xmath7 note that the total curvature of a closed planar trajectory , equal to the `` winding number '' or `` turning number '' multiplied by @xmath8 , is a homotopy invariant .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the term `` _ _ winding angle _ _ '' is also used in polymer physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) where , however , it rather refers to @xmath9 thus , @xmath10 is the winding angle of the radius vector of the trajectory in configuration space , whereas @xmath0 yields an analogous quantity but in velocity space .",
    "the distribution of @xmath10 s for brownian trajectories has been studied for a long time ( see e.g. @xcite ) , while that of @xmath0 s has not been analyzed so far . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that @xmath0 is a more appropriate quantity for certain problems , for example those including spin ( spin hall effect , etc ) , as we will argue below .",
    "we consider for simplicity the 2d case .",
    "generalizations to 3d and tensors are fairly simple , but the resulting formulas are more involved and less intuitive . in the planar case",
    "the winding angle vector @xmath0 is normal to the plane , hence it suffices to consider @xmath11 , the unique non - zero component of @xmath0 .",
    "the transport of the winding angle is described by the average current density @xmath12 where the symbol @xmath13 denotes averaging over a set of brownian trajectories , or , in the discrete case , of random walks .    in the case of an infinite plane ( or a plane with periodic boundary conditions ) and of equilibrium ,",
    "the particle density does not depend on the coordinates and the average @xmath14 vanishes identically as well as the average of the winding current density ( [ tok ] ) .",
    "if , however , a confined planar geometry is considered , then @xmath14 will still be vanishing but , as we will show below , this will not be the case for the winding current , because of the geometrical constraints .",
    "namely , due to the mere existence of boundaries , there will exist trajectories whose contribution to the winding will not be canceled by that of other trajectories . as a result , there will necessarily appear an anti - parallel edge current with @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 will not identically vanish anymore .",
    "these surviving edge currents can be viewed as analogs of spin edge currents in the spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "before considering the winding currents , it is useful to discuss briefly an important example of spin - orbit interaction where the spin degree of freedom depends on the winding angle @xmath11",
    ".    it seems known that in electronic transport in the presence of charged impurities the electron spin depends on the winding of their trajectories .",
    "this dependence manifests itself , for instance , as the so called _ skew scattering _ in the `` _ _ extrinsic _ _ '' spin hall effect rashbaextrspinhall , dassarmaextrspinhall .",
    "however , in the literature on the subject , the concept of trajectory winding is mostly implicit .",
    "recall that in electronic transport impurities interact with electrons and thus the scattering angle , hence the deviation of the electron trajectory from a ballistic straight line , depends , in relativistic theory , on the spin .",
    "more generally , it is known that if , for any reason ( not necessarily related to electrons scattering on charged impurities ) the trajectory of a relativistic particle is not a straight line , the curving of the trajectory changes the spin degree of freedom of the particle .",
    "this purely kinematic relativistic effect is due to the successive non - parallel lorentz transformations ( _ boosts _ ) that lead to the so - called wigner rotation of the spin , or the thomas - wigner precession .",
    "the variation of the precession angle of a classical rotating moment resulting from an infinitesimal turning of the velocity has been obtained by thomas @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a vector of the precession angle , @xmath20 is the velocity , @xmath21 its variation , and @xmath22 is the speed of light .",
    "( [ eq : wigner_rotation ] ) gives the leading relativistic approximation for the precession angle .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the exact relativistic expression is still a matter of controversy ( see the recent articles malykin2006 , ritus2011 , zanimovskystepanovsky2010 ) .",
    "note also that the dirac equation allows for a more precise study of this effect .",
    "however the classical result ( [ eq : wigner_rotation ] ) of thomas is sufficiently accurate to describe well the spin - orbit splitting in atoms @xcite .",
    "it has played an important role in the genesis of the quantum theory of radiation ( see e.g @xcite ) .    comparing ( [ eq : thetadef ] ) and ( [ eq : wigner_rotation ] )",
    ", we find a simple relation between the moment precession angle and the winding angle of the trajectory @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the trajectory turning angle .",
    "note that , in many cases , the precession angle during the observation time is essentially equal to the winding angle multiplied by a small parameter @xmath25 ( e.g. the case of fermions at temperatures below fermi temperature , or any particles in the case of elastic scattering ) .",
    "let us now argue that the spatial curvature of a trajectory is equivalent to the action of a magnetic field on a spin degree of freedom .",
    "indeed , it is known that an homogeneous magnetic field in the rest frame of a classical spin results in its larmor precession @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spin in angular momentum units , @xmath28 is the magnetic field , @xmath29 is the gyro - magnetic factor , and @xmath30 is the mass .",
    "thus , an effective magnetic field with a larmor frequency equal to the frequency @xmath31 of thomas - wigner precession ( @xmath32 ) has the form @xmath33 the spin - field interaction energy is then @xmath34 hence , the direction and the magnitude of the effective magnetic field are intimately related to the winding angle .",
    "returning to random walks of electrons in solids ( which can result from electrons scattering on charged impurities , see e.g. @xcite ) , we note that in this case it follows from ( [ eq - heff ] ) that the effective magnetic field of the lorentz transformation of the impurity electric field can be included in the wigner - thomas precession and vice versa , thus forming a complete spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we also note that , leaving aside electrons in solids , the above discussion can refer in general to the diffusion of any particles with non - zero spin or magnetic moment in disordered media , for example spin 1 photons whose motion in a medium with random refractive index can be described as a diffusion process @xcite ) , as well as in foams , metamaterials , dense plasma , etc ...",
    "(see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us now turn to numerical simulations which do support the existence of winding edge currents .",
    "we consider the strip of width @xmath35 along the horizontal axis and of length @xmath36 along the vertical axis on a planar square lattice of period 1 . in the longitudinal direction",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed at @xmath37 . in the transverse direction reflecting ( hard ) walls enclose the strip in a finite width @xmath38 .",
    "we consider @xmath39 independent particles whose trajectories are random walks on the lattice . the diffusion time step @xmath40 is assumed to be unity and random hoppings are allowed only to the nearest neighbor sites .",
    "let @xmath41and @xmath42 be respectively the position and the winding angle of the @xmath43th particle after @xmath44 jumps .",
    "it is clear that each next turn ( left or right ) increases or decreases @xmath45 by @xmath46 .",
    "we assume , for the sake of definiteness , that a backward scattering does not change the winding angle of the trajectory .",
    "the time averaged winding current @xmath47 at a point @xmath48 of the lattice is after @xmath49 steps ( i.e. during the observation time @xmath50 ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the kronecker delta .",
    "we analyzed a wide range of parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath49 , and @xmath55 .",
    "typical results are shown in fig.[figure : simulation - jvec ] for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and strip sizes @xmath58 . to display the 2d vector field @xmath17",
    ", we use a 2d palette as in fig.[figure : palette ] .",
    "the palette center corresponds to zero vector field and its vertical and horizontal edges correspond to the range of the components @xmath59 and @xmath60 of @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the palette is divided in four sectors of different colors with a radial variation of the color intensity .",
    "this allows to distinguish the approximate direction and magnitude of the current .",
    "the numerical simulations for @xmath61 are shown in fig.[figure : jplus ] .    in the bulk of the sample",
    "only small - scale fluctuations of the winding current can be seen .",
    "however , things differ strongly from the bulk in the narrow neighborhoods of the walls : winding currents do exist along the edges .",
    "they materialize as almost continuous and narrow lines on the left and right edges of the sample ( blue and red , according to the direction ) .",
    "the non vanishing longitudinal component of the winding current , averaged over @xmath62 , is displayed in fig.[figure : jsum ] .",
    "it is concentrated within one lattice site from the edges and directed downward near the left edge and upward near the right edge .",
    "fig.[figure : jmodulus ] displays the absolute value of the current density @xmath63 and how it concentrates on the edges with an increase of the simulation time @xmath49 .",
    "since the system is in equilibrium , i.e. , external fields are absent and the particles are distributed uniformly , winding currents can only originate from the confining boundaries and the chaotic kinetic energy of the random walk trajectories .",
    "thus , these currents are by nature persistent .",
    "let us consider a simple model where the effect of winding currents is explicit .",
    "it consists of planar continuous brownian trajectories described by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process in a potential @xmath64 applied along the @xmath65 axis and infinitely growing as @xmath66 .",
    "the potential plays the role of the _ soft walls _  confining the brownian particles , and thereby encodes the geometric constraints . as in the previous section ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions at @xmath67 are assumed in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the stochastic ( langevin ) equations of motion are @xmath68where @xmath69 is the coordinate of the particle , @xmath70 is its velocity , @xmath30 is the mass of the particle , @xmath71 is the viscosity and @xmath72 is the random force assumed to be the gaussian white noise , i.e. @xmath73 since we are interested in the winding of trajectories of the above random process , we consider the joint probability density of the coordinate , velocity and winding angle @xmath11 @xmath74the @xmath75 integration of ( [ distbis ] ) yields the density @xmath76 satisfying the usual kramers equation @xcite ( fokker - planck equation with external potential)@xmath77 where @xmath78 is defined in ( [ wnc ] ) and the standard summation convention over repeated indices is understood .",
    "it is easy to check that the probability density @xmath79 in ( [ kreq ] ) converges as @xmath80 to a stationary maxwell - boltzmann distribution in @xmath81 and @xmath20 with a @xmath82 normalization factor in the longitudinal direction @xmath83 ( see ( [ pst ] ) ) .",
    "note that one could also use reflecting boundary conditions or a weak confining potential in this direction .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for @xmath84 can be obtained as follows .",
    "let us denote @xmath85 then @xmath86 and @xmath87then eq . ( [ eq : langevin ] ) implies @xmath88\\langle \\xi _ { j}\\mathfrak{\\delta } \\rangle \\ .\\end{gathered}\\]]to deal with the correlation functions @xmath89 , we use the furutsu - novikov formula ( see e.g. @xcite , chapter 10 and @xcite , chapter 5 ) valid for any functional @xmath90 $ ] of the @xmath91-correlated gaussian random functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xmath94\\rangle = \\frac{d}{2}\\big\\langle \\frac{\\delta } { \\delta \\xi _ { j}(t)}r_{t}[\\xi ] \\big\\rangle \\ .\\ ] ] we obtain after integration by parts @xmath95to find the variational derivatives of @xmath96 and @xmath97 with respect to @xmath98 , we apply the operation @xmath99 to the integrated langevin equations , then use the principle of causality and take the limit @xmath100 .",
    "this yields @xmath101and @xmath102the variational derivative of @xmath75 in ( [ eq : maincor ] ) is calculated using ( [ eq : thetadef ] ) @xmath103and finally @xmath104thus , the correlation functions @xmath89 are expressed via the partial derivatives of @xmath105 @xmath106we assume for the sake simplicity that the diffusion coefficient @xmath78 does not depend on the velocity and we take into account the relation @xmath107 .",
    "we obtain the fokker - plank equation @xmath108 in the case at hand where the potential @xmath64 depends only on the transverse coordinate @xmath81 ( modeling the soft walls of a deep valley ) the fokker - planck equation becomes @xmath109eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinetic ] ) differs from the kramers equation by the terms on the right - hand side .",
    "the physical meanings of the first and fourth terms are the most interesting .",
    "it is already clear here and will be even more clear below that the former is the current in the @xmath83 direction and the latter is responsible for the diffusive spreading of @xmath75 .",
    "we also note that after integration over @xmath75 ( eq : kinetic ) coincides with the kramers equation ( [ kreq ] ) .",
    "( [ eq : kinetic ] ) allows us to study the transfer of arbitrary @xmath11-dependent quantities as well as non - equilibrium situations corresponding to arbitrary initial conditions . in the particular case of the winding current ( [ tok ] ) , which is linear in @xmath11",
    ", the steady - state current can be found without actually solving the equation .    indeed",
    ", it is clear that the transverse component @xmath59 of the mean current density @xmath17 vanishes . to find the average longitudinal component @xmath110",
    "let us multiply ( [ eq : kinetic ] ) by @xmath111 and integrate over @xmath20 and @xmath11 .",
    "we obtain after integration by parts @xmath112the probability density @xmath113 approaches for large time the stationary distribution @xmath114where @xmath115is a normalization constant .",
    "it follows then from ( [ eq : jhydro ] ) and ( [ pst ] ) that for @xmath116 the current @xmath110 relaxes to its stationary form @xmath117where @xmath118 is the steady state ( boltzmann ) probability distribution in the transverse direction .",
    "we obtain finally for the local average density of winding current per unit length in the longitudinal direction@xmath119where @xmath120 is the number of particles per unit length in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the average winding current density ( [ cut ] ) is proportional to the gradient of the potential and to the local density of diffusing particles , which is determined by the temperature and the height of the potential at a given point @xmath65 .",
    "one can easily see that the currents are antiparallel on opposite walls .",
    "the gradient of the potential and the boltzmann distribution also determine the currents width .",
    "particular examples of currents profiles are shown in figure [ figure : profile - linear ] for an harmonic potential @xmath121 and a trapezoidal potential @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the heaviside step function [ @xmath124 for @xmath125 , and @xmath126 for @xmath127 ] .",
    "note that formula ( [ eq : mainresult ] ) can be interpreted ( up to a small relativistic factor ) as describing the diffusion of magnetic moments in an effective magnetic field @xmath128 $ ] , thereby corresponding to the setting of the spin hall effect in the potential @xmath64 , as already mentioned above .",
    "we recall that in our approach there is no interaction , and no magnetic ( or any other type ) moments .",
    "we are only dealing with distributions of trajectories winding , hence the above effect can be viewed as purely dynamical ( winding hall effect ) .",
    "assume finally without loss of generality that @xmath129 .",
    "then the spatial average of @xmath130 in ( [ cut ] ) over @xmath131 ( or @xmath132 ) is @xmath133 this can be viewed as a manifestation of the weak dependence of our results on the concrete form of the confining potential ( considering that @xmath134 is the effective planar density of particles ) .",
    "we demonstrated that random walks or continuous brownian motions in a confined planar geometry generate dissipationless persistent currents of degrees of freedom associated with the winding of their trajectories .",
    "this is a purely edge effect where the currents are formed in a close neighborhood of the boundaries . in the case of the soft walls , where the geometric confinement is provided by an infinitely growing transverse potential ,",
    "the channel width of the current is determined by the gradient of the potential and the thermal energy of the particles . in the case of reflecting boundaries ( hard - walls ) ,",
    "the channel width is just a single diffusion step , according to the numerical simulations .    in the microscopic world , the spin and geometric phase are examples of degrees of freedom which depend on the winding .",
    "note that it is commonly believed that in the spin hall effect the dissipationless edge currents arise in the conditions of the quantum _ _",
    "intrinsic__regime , where dissipation and chaos are absent because of quantization . since",
    ", however , the above _ extrinsic _  spin hall effect corresponds to an ordinary diffusion , thus to a sufficiently high dissipation , one would think that persistent spin currents should not occur .",
    "however , as we have shown , this is not the case simply because of the chaotic kinetic energy of the random trajectories of the particles .",
    "similar effects may occur in purely mechanical systems where relativistic or quantum phenomena are absent .",
    "for example , the torque of a compass arrow in a moving car is also a degree of freedom which `` feels '' the curvature of the car trajectory .",
    "thus , the effect studied here can be of interest beyond the scope of phenomena associated with the spin hall effect .",
    "in the case of the ornstein - uhlenbeck model with soft walls we have obtained an analytical expression for the persistent current of the winding via the boltzmann distribution in an arbitrary transverse confining potential .",
    "the kinetic equation takes into account the winding of particles and , in principle , allows to explore the joint probability distributions in the single - particle phase space of the degrees of freedom with an arbitrary dependence on the winding .",
    "this work was supported by the ukrainian branch of the french - russian poncelet laboratory and the grant 23/12-n of the national academy of sciences of ukraine .",
