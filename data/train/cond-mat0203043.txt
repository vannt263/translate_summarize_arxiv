    "liquid crystal anchoring effects have been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically during the past decades @xcite .",
    "such an interest is well understood since most liquid crystal devices are cells comprising orienting surfaces with a liquid crystal in between .",
    "typically , aligning surfaces provide a uniform orientation of the liquid crystal director in the cell interior .    on the phenomenological level ,",
    "liquid crystal anchoring can be described by two basic parameters : the easy axis direction , @xmath0 , and the anchoring coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "these two parameters are critical design parameters for every liquid crystal device @xcite . a variety of _ experimental _ methods have been proposed to measure anchoring parameters , in particular the anchoring coefficient @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "most of them measure surface director deviations in an external field and involve rather complicated optical setups .    in spite of the practical importance , the mechanism of the director alignment is still not well understood .",
    "experimental techniques always involve optical measurements .",
    "they test the entire liquid crystal cell and therefore can not provide a satisfactory description of the thin interface region .",
    "theoretical investigations of anchoring are also quite controversial .",
    "for example , the usual continuous phenomenological theory has divergent surface terms in the elastic free energy expansion @xcite .",
    "one of the approaches for the systematic investigation of anchoring phenomena is computer simulation of liquid crystals in confined geometries .",
    "indeed , computer simulation is a well established method to treat bulk elastic coefficients @xcite , the surface anchoring strength @xcite , and structures of disclination cores @xcite .",
    "this means that computer simulation allows investigation of details of the liquid crystalline structure which can not be resolved experimentally .",
    "several papers have already been published trying to search for reasonable surface potentials to use in simulations .",
    "however , most of them do not characterize aligning surfaces using well established parameters .",
    "questions about the formation of a solid interface layer , values of the easy axis angle and anchoring coefficient are still open .",
    "the reason for this is probably a lack of reliable methods to measure these parameters by computer simulation .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a technique to measure the surface anchoring strength @xmath1 by computer simulation .",
    "the method itself is based on the study of the _ director fluctuations _ in the liquid crystal cell .",
    "a similar approach has already been used for the _ experimental _ characterization of the interface @xcite and is based on measuring the light scattering caused by the director fluctuations . in computer simulation ,",
    "the director fluctuations can be studied directly , using ensemble averages of functions of the second - rank order tensor components .",
    "a fit to the fluctuation amplitudes with equations predicted by elastic theory then allows determination of the surface anchoring strength .",
    "large length- and time - scale fluctuations of the director @xmath2 can be described in the continuum model of liquid crystals , based on the phenomenological elastic constants . in this approach ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equations for the director and the boundary conditions can be obtained by minimization of the cell free energy @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a hydrodynamic term with an effective viscosity coefficient @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the frank elastic free energy , and @xmath7 is the surface anchoring energy .    in",
    "what follows we use the one - elastic - constant approximation , i.e.  @xmath8 .",
    "then the frank free energy can be brought into the form : @xmath9 d{\\bf r } \\:.\\ ] ]    the liquid crystal cell is bounded by surfaces @xmath10 which provide some kind of anchoring condition @xcite . below we consider _ homeotropic _ anchoring , that is , normal to the surface .",
    "_ planar _ anchoring can be treated in the same way .",
    "we assume that the interaction of the director with the cell surfaces has the rapini - papoular form @xcite : @xmath11 where unit vectors @xmath12 define directions of the easy axes at @xmath10 : @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; @xmath1 is the anchoring energy , and @xmath15 .",
    "equations for the director and boundary conditions can be obtained by minimization of the cell free energy eqn  ( [ eqn : f_total ] ) . in the case of homeotropic anchoring on both surfaces the stationary director distribution in the cell is homeotropic , i.e.  @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we have to investigate small perturbations of the director around the distribution : @xmath17 minimizing the total free energy ( [ eqn : f_total ] ) and linearizing the equations for the director and boundary conditions with respect to @xmath18 , we obtain equations @xmath19 and boundary conditions @xmath20 for the fluctuations . taking into account eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : director ] ) , the expression for the free energy fluctuations can be rewritten in the form of the average of the self - conjugate ( hermitian ) operator @xmath21 : @xmath22 the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath21 , which satisfy boundary conditions ( [ eqn : boundary ] ) , form a complete set of orthogonal functions characterized by wave vector @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , @xmath24 can be expanded in a series of these orthogonal functions : @xmath25 \\ : ,    \\label{eqn : fluct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 here we have introduced the dimensionless wave vector @xmath28 and anchoring parameter @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the extrapolation length @xcite .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath31 form a discrete spectrum because of confinement in the @xmath32 direction which depends on the anchoring energy @xmath1 ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "the explicit form of the @xmath31 spectrum is given by the secular equation : @xmath33 each individual mode can now be seen from eqn  ( [ eqn : hydro ] ) to relax exponentially with a relaxation time given by @xmath34    substituting expansion ( [ eqn : fluct ] ) into the free energy ( [ eqn : denergy ] ) , and performing the integration over the cell volume we obtain : @xmath35 integrating , we took into account the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions in the expansion ( [ eqn : fluct ] ) with different eigenvectors @xmath23 , which allowed us to reduce the summations over @xmath23 , @xmath36 to a single sum over @xmath23 .",
    "application of the equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics , just as for elastic fluctuations in bulk liquid crystals @xcite , gives the fluctuation amplitudes : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "in molecular simulations , rather than measuring director fluctuations , it is more convenient to measure fluctuations of the second - rank order tensor components ( following forster @xcite ) .",
    "we define the real - space order tensor density @xmath39 where @xmath40 , in terms of the orientation vectors @xmath41 of each molecule @xmath42 ( we consider only uniaxial molecules ) .",
    "if we assume that there is no variation in the _ degree _ of ordering , we may write @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the order parameter , i.e.  the largest eigenvalue of @xmath45 . if the director @xmath46 is taken to lie along the @xmath32 axis throughout the sample , the off - diagonal components @xmath47 , @xmath48 , are proportional to the fluctuations of the corresponding director components @xmath49 this is the situation for homeotropic anchoring at both surfaces",
    ". for planar anchoring , with the director along @xmath50 and the surface normal along @xmath32 , the components @xmath51 , @xmath52 are important ( and non - equivalent ) .",

    "both the permitted @xmath67 spectrum , and the variation of @xmath68 with @xmath69 are sensitive to the anchoring strength parameter @xmath70 .",

    "therefore , it is always possible to truncate this sum and use only the first values of the @xmath31 spectrum .",
    "then , for large @xmath59 or for @xmath72 , eq . ( [ eqn : theory ] ) can be simplified so that the dependence on @xmath59 is explicit : @xmath73 ^{2}\\sum_{q_{z}}~\\frac{\\chi ^{2}}{q_{z}^{2}\\left ( 2\\xi + \\chi ^{2}+\\xi ^{2}\\right ) } .",

    "this means that we can adjust the cell thickness @xmath65 independently of parameters @xmath76 and @xmath66 by examining characteristic wavelength of the fluctuation amplitude @xmath77 .",
    "to test the technique proposed , we simulated a liquid crystal confined between parallel walls ( slab geometry ) , with finite homeotropic anchoring at the walls .",
    "the director fluctuations occur around the preferred , _ uniform _ , alignment perpendicular to the walls .",
    "we performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the liquid crystal system .",
    "we used a molecular model which has been studied earlier in this geometry @xcite .",
    "the molecules in this study were modelled as hard ellipsoids of revolution of elongation @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the length of the semi - major axis and @xmath80 the length of the two equal semi - minor axes . the phase diagram and properties of this family of models",
    "are well studied @xcite .",
    "it is useful to express the density as a fraction of the close - packed density @xmath81 of perfectly aligned hard ellipsoids , assuming an affinely - transformed face - centred cubic or hexagonal close packed lattice . in this case",
    ", the isotropic - nematic phase transition occurs at quite a low density , @xmath82 , and the simulations are performed at a state point corresponding to @xmath83 , for which the nematic order parameter is @xmath84 . for this model ,",
    "temperature is not a significant thermodynamic quantity , so it is possible to choose @xmath85 throughout .",
    "the slab geometry is defined by two hard parallel confining walls , which can not be penetrated by the _ centres _ of the ellipsoidal molecules .",
    "packing considerations generate homeotropic ordering at the surface .",
    "surface anchoring in this system has been studied recently @xcite for a system with wall separation @xmath86 , by applying an orienting perturbation at one of the walls and observing the response at the other .",
    "this yielded an estimate of the extrapolation length @xmath87 . in the current work , simulations were carried out for systems of @xmath88 particles with wall separations @xmath89 , which ( from the above estimate of @xmath30 ) would correspond to surface anchoring parameters in the range @xmath90 .    to be sure that we have the same state point for each simulation , we adjusted the density to have the same @xmath91 component of the pressure tensor for all systems .",
    "then a sequence of runs was carried out using the constant-@xmath92 ensemble , allowing typically @xmath93 mc sweeps for equilibration and @xmath94 sweeps for accumulation of averages ( one sweep is one attempted move per particle ) .",
    "the simulation results were analysed to give a density profile , and an order tensor profile , which are shown in figs  [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:2 ] . from these profiles",
    "we can see that the walls are sufficiently well separated , and the variation of the order parameter across the slab is small , even in spite of the large change in local density near the walls .",

    "distances are normalized by the molecular semi - axis length @xmath79 and the density is expressed relative to the closed - packed density @xmath95 for perfectly aligned ellipsoids .",

    ", width=302 ]    the order tensor fluctuations in reciprocal space were calculated using expression ( [ eqn : simul ] ) . to fit the simulation results with the elastic theory we have to remember that the size of the simulation box @xmath96 is not necessarily equal to the liquid crystal cell thickness @xmath65 appearing in the elastic theory .",
    "the former is a physical quantity , which , in statistical mechanics , is determined by the positions at which the liquid number density becomes identically zero .",
    "the latter appears in the elastic theory : it is determined by the positions at which the orientational elastic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "physically , the difference may be ascribed to partial penetration of the walls by the liquid crystal molecules , formation of an ordered ( or solid ) layer near the walls , or other molecular - scale features .",
    "we assume that we may write @xmath97 , where the value @xmath98 ( which may be positive or negative ) is characteristic of the wall , independent of @xmath99 , and may be determined in our fitting process .",

    "the theoretical fitting curves agree well with the simulation results , for small values of @xmath59 , as one would expect for a theory valid for long wavelength fluctuations . at higher",
    "@xmath59 , the structure ( emphasized in the inset of fig .  [ fig:4 ] by a multiplying factor @xmath108 ) is not perfectly reproduced , but the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "this is not surprising , since we expect the elastic theory to become less accurate at higher @xmath109 .",
    "finally , we note that the extrapolation distance relative to the simulation wall position is @xmath110 , which compares moderately well with the value @xmath111 obtained in the previous study of this system @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the director configuration of that work does not allow one to determine , separately , @xmath98 and @xmath30 , so the quoted value of @xmath30 really represents @xmath112 .",
    "we have to point out some possible limitations of the method .",
    "the first one is computational time .",
    "the effect of the surfaces is to dampen the amplitude of long - wavelength modes ; these have the longest relaxation times , according to eqn  ( [ eqn : time ] ) , and so it is essential to carry out very long runs to adequately sample them .",
    "we have paid some attention to estimating the error bars on the measured values of @xmath113 , as indicated in fig  [ fig:4 ] : the larger values at low @xmath109 follow directly from this effect .",
    "we shall return to examine the time - dependence of fluctuations in a future publication .",
    "the second limitation is the actual sensitivity of the measured averages to the variation in the anchoring strength and cell thickness .",
    "one might expect that in practice it is not possible to measure large values of the anchoring parameter @xmath114 , so we need reasonably thin cells .",
    "as the cell thickness @xmath99 becomes large , the fluctuation spectrum becomes insensitive to @xmath115 .",
    "however , it is important that the walls do not become too close : the _ bulk _ region should be sufficiently large compared to the _ interfacial _ region . only in this case",
    "can we assume that the scalar order parameter @xmath44 in the liquid crystal bulk is constant for large scale fluctuation modes .",
