    "experimental and theoretical studies of exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values present one of the most active areas of research in nuclear physics . experiments with radioactive nuclear beams provide the opportunity to study very short - lived nuclei with very large neutron to proton ratios @xmath3 .",
    "new theoretical models and techniques are being developed in order to describe unique phenomena in nuclei very different from those usually encountered along the line of stability .",
    "on the neutron - rich side in particular , exotic phenomena include the weak binding of the outermost neutrons , pronounced effects of the coupling between bound states and the particle continuum , regions of nuclei with very diffuse neutron densities , formation of the neutron skin and halo structures .",
    "the modification of the effective nuclear potential produces a suppression of shell effects , the disappearance of spherical magic numbers , and the onset of deformation and shape coexistence .",
    "isovector quadrupole deformations are expected at the neutron drip - lines , and possible low - energy collective isovector modes have been predicted .",
    "because of their relevance to the r - process in nucleosynthesis , nuclei close to the neutron drip - line are also very important in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "their properties determine the astrophysical conditions for the formation of neutron - rich stable isotopes .",
    "proton - rich nuclei also display many interesting structure phenomena which are important both for nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "these nuclei are characterized by exotic ground - state decay modes such as direct emission of charged particles and @xmath4-decays with large q - values .",
    "the properties of many proton - rich nuclei should also play an important role in the process of nucleosynthesis by rapid - proton capture .",
    "in addition to decay properties ( particle emission , @xmath4-decay ) , of fundamental importance are studies of atomic masses and separation energies , and especially the precise location of proton drip - lines .    particularly important are nuclear systems with an equal number of proton and neutrons .",
    "due to the high symmetry between the proton and neutron degrees of freedom , it is possible to study the details of the effective off - shell @xmath5 interaction .",
    "protons and neutrons occupy the same shell - model orbitals and therefore these nuclei present unique systems in which @xmath6 and @xmath7 pairing can be studied . while",
    "for @xmath8 the @xmath9 nuclei are @xmath4-stable , in heavier systems the coulomb interaction drives the beta - stability line towards neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "heavier @xmath9 nuclei approach the proton drip - line and display a variety of structure phenomena : shape coexistence , superdeformation , alignment of proton - neutron pairs , proton radioactivity from highly excited states .",
    "some of the most interesting examples of nuclear systems with large isospin values are provided by the recent experimental results on the synthesis and stability of the heaviest elements .",
    "the periodic system has been extended with three new elements @xmath10 .",
    "these elements are found beyond the macroscopic limit of nuclear stability and are stabilized only by quantal shell effects .",
    "all the heaviest elements found recently are believed to be well deformed .",
    "still heavier and more neutron - rich elements are expected to be spherical and stabilized by shell effects , which strongly influence the spontaneous fission and alpha - decay half - lives .",
    "while an impressive amount of experimental data on properties of exotic nuclei has been published in the last decade , the development of theoretical models has proceeded at a somewhat slower pace .",
    "significant progress has been reported in the development of mean - field theories and theoretical models which use effective interactions to describe low energy nuclear states .",
    "calculations based on modern monte carlo shell - model techniques provide a relatively accurate description of the structure of light and medium - mass exotic nuclei . for medium - heavy and heavy systems the only viable approach at present",
    "are large scale self - consistent mean - field calculations ( hartree - fock , hartree - fock - bogoliubov , relativistic mean - field )",
    ". however , the present accuracy of model predictions , in general , is not comparable with the precision of modern experimental research facilities , and there are many serious technical difficulties in the calculation of properties of complex nuclear systems at the drip - lines .",
    "models based on quantum hadrodynamics @xcite provide a framework in which the nuclear system is described by interacting baryons and mesons . in comparison with conventional non relativistic descriptions ,",
    "relativistic models explicitly include mesonic degrees of freedom and consider the nucleons as dirac particles .",
    "a variety of nuclear phenomena have been described in the relativistic framework : nuclear matter , properties of finite spherical and deformed nuclei , hypernuclei , neutron stars , nucleon - nucleus and electron - nucleus scattering , relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in particular , relativistic models based on the mean - field approximation have been successfully applied in the description of properties of spherical and deformed @xmath4-stable nuclei , and more recently in studies of exotic nuclei far from the valley of beta stability .",
    "detailed properties of nuclear matter and of finite nuclei along the @xmath4-stability line have been very successfully described with relativistic mean - field models @xcite .",
    "the nucleus is described as a system of dirac nucleons , which interact in a relativistic covariant manner through the exchange of virtual mesons :  the isoscalar scalar @xmath11-meson , the isoscalar vector @xmath12-meson and the isovector vector @xmath13-meson .",
    "the effective lagrangian density of quantum hadrodynamics reads @xmath14 vectors in isospin space are denoted by arrows , and bold - faced symbols will indicate vectors in ordinary three - dimensional space .",
    "the dirac spinor @xmath15 denotes the nucleon with mass @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the masses of the @xmath11-meson , the @xmath12-meson , and the @xmath13-meson .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the corresponding coupling constants for the mesons to the nucleon . @xmath23 .",
    "the coupling constants and unknown meson masses are parameters , adjusted to fit data of nuclear matter and of finite nuclei .",
    "@xmath24 denotes the non - linear @xmath11 self - interaction @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are field tensors @xmath29 the lowest order of the quantum field theory is the _ mean - field _ approximation : the meson field operators are replaced by their expectation values .",
    "the @xmath30 nucleons , described by a slater determinant @xmath31 of single - particle spinors @xmath32 , move independently in the classical meson fields .",
    "the sources of the meson fields are defined by the nucleon densities and currents .",
    "the ground state of a nucleus is described by the stationary self - consistent solution of the coupled system of dirac and klein - gordon equations .",
    "due to time reversal invariance , there are no currents in the static solution for an even - even system , and therefore the spatial vector components and @xmath33 of the vector meson fields vanish .",
    "the dirac equation reads @xmath34 the effective mass @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 and the potential @xmath37 as @xmath38    in nuclei with odd numbers of protons or neutrons time reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "the odd particle induces polarization currents and the time - odd components in the meson fields .",
    "these fields play an essential role in the description of magnetic moments and of moments of inertia in rotating nuclei .",
    "however , their effect on deformations and binding energies is very small and can be neglected to a good approximation .    in order to describe ground - state properties of open - shell nuclei ,",
    "pairing correlations have to be taken into account . for nuclei close to the @xmath4-stability line , pairing has been included in the relativistic mean - field model in the form of a simple bcs approximation @xcite .",
    "however , for nuclei far from stability the bcs model presents only a poor approximation .",
    "in particular , in drip - line nuclei the fermi level is found close to the particle continuum .",
    "the lowest particle - hole or particle - particle modes are often embedded in the continuum , and the coupling between bound and continuum states has to be taken into account explicitly .",
    "the bcs model does not provide a correct description of the scattering of nucleonic pairs from bound states to the positive energy continuum  @xcite ; levels high in the continuum become partially occupied . including the system in a box of finite size leads to unreliable predictions for nuclear radii depending on the size of this box . in the non - relativistic case ,",
    "a unified description of mean - field and pairing correlations is obtained in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory @xcite .",
    "the ground state of a nucleus @xmath39 is represented as the vacuum with respect to independent quasi - particles .",
    "the quasi - particle operators are defined by a unitary bogoliubov transformation of the single - nucleon creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the generalized single - particle hamiltonian of hfb theory contains two average potentials : the self - consistent field @xmath40 which encloses all the long range _",
    "_ correlations , and a pairing field @xmath41 which sums up the _",
    "pp_-correlations . the expectation value of the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath42 can be expressed as a function of the hermitian density matrix @xmath13 and the antisymmetric pairing tensor @xmath43 .",
    "the variation of the energy functional with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath43 produces the single quasi - particle hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations @xmath44 hfb - theory , being a variational approximation , results in a violation of basic symmetries of the nuclear system . among the most important",
    "is the non conservation of the number of particles . in order",
    "that the expectation value of the particle number operator in the ground state equals the number of nucleons , equations ( [ equ.2.1 ] ) contain a chemical potential @xmath45 which has to be determined by the particle number subsidiary condition .",
    "the column vectors denote the quasi - particle wave functions , and @xmath46 are the quasi - particle energies .",
    "if the pairing field @xmath47 is diagonal and constant , hfb reduces to the bcs - approximation .",
    "the lower and upper components @xmath48 and @xmath49 are proportional , with the bcs - occupation amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 as proportionality constants . for a more general pairing interaction",
    "this will no longer be the case . as opposed to the functions @xmath48 , the lower components @xmath49 are localized functions of * r * , as long as the chemical potential @xmath45 is below the continuum limit .",
    "since the densities are bilinear products of @xmath49 ( see eqs.([equ.2.3.e])-([equ.2.3.h ] ) ) , the system is always localized .",
    "the hfb wave function can be written either in the quasiparticle basis as a product of independent quasi - particle states , or in the _ canonical basis _ as a highly correlated bcs - state . in the _ canonical basis _",
    "nucleons occupy single - particle states . if the chemical potential is close to the continuum , the pairing interaction scatters pairs of nucleons into continuum states . because of additional pairing correlations , particles which occupy those levels can not evaporate .",
    "mathematically this is expressed by an additional non - trivial transformation which connects the particle operators in the canonical basis to the quasi - particles of the hfb wave function .",
    "the relativistic extension of the hfb theory was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the hartree approximation for the self - consistent mean field ,",

    "the source terms in equations ( [ equ.2.3.a ] ) to ( [ equ.2.3.d ] ) are sums of bilinear products of baryon amplitudes @xmath55 where the sums run over all positive energy states . for @xmath56 degrees of freedom ,",
    "for example number of nodes on a radial mesh , the hb equations are @xmath57-dimensional and have @xmath57 eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "to each eigenvector @xmath58 with eigenvalue @xmath46 , there corresponds an eigenvector @xmath59 with eigenvalue @xmath60 .",
    "since baryon quasi - particle operators satisfy fermion commutation relations , it is forbidden to occupy the levels @xmath46 and @xmath60 simultaneously .",
    "usually one chooses the @xmath56 positive eigenvalues @xmath46 for the solution that corresponds to a ground state of a nucleus with even particle number .",

    "spherical symmetry , i.e. single closed - shell nuclei , the coupled system of equations has been solved using finite element methods in coordinate space @xcite , and by expansion in a basis of spherical harmonic oscillator  @xcite . for deformed nuclei the present version of the model does not include solutions in coordinate space .",
    "the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov equations and the equations for the meson fields are solved by expanding the nucleon spinors @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the meson fields in terms of the eigenfunctions of a deformed axially symmetric oscillator potential  @xcite .",
    "of course for nuclei at the drip - lines , solutions in configurational representation might not provide an accurate description of properties that crucially depend on the spatial extension of nucleon densities , as for example nuclear radii .",

    "the corresponding eigenvalues are the single quasi - particle energies .",

    "the self - consistent quasi - particle eigenspectrum is then transformed into the canonical basis of single - particle states .",
    "the canonical basis is defined to be the one in which the matrix @xmath67 is diagonal .",
    "the transformation to the canonical basis determines the energies and occupation probabilities of single - particle states , which correspond to the self - consistent solution for the ground state of a nucleus .",
    "the details of ground - state properties of nuclei at the drip - lines will depend on the coupling constants and masses of the effective lagrangian , on the pairing interaction and coupling between bound and continuum states .",
    "several parameter sets of the mean - field lagrangian have been derived that provide a satisfactory description of nuclear properties along the @xmath4-stability line . in particular ,",
    "nl1 @xcite , nl - sh @xcite , and nl3 @xcite .",
    "the effective forces nl1 and nl - sh have been frequently used to calculate properties of nuclear matter and of finite nuclei , and have become standard parameterizations for relativistic mean - field calculations .",
    "the parameter set nl3 has been derived more recently @xcite , by adjusting to ground state properties of a large number of spherical nuclei .",
    "properties calculated with nl3 indicate that this is probably the best rmf effective interaction so far , both for nuclei at and away from the line of @xmath4-stability .    in many applications of the relativistic mean - field model pairing correlations",
    "have been taken into account in a very phenomenological way in the bcs - theory with monopole pairing force adjusted to the experimental odd - even mass differences . this framework obviously can not be applied to the description of the coupling to the particle continuum in nuclei close to the drip - line .",
    "the question therefore arises , which pairing interaction @xmath64 should be used in eq .",
    "( [ equ.2.5 ] ) . in principle , in ref .",
    "@xcite a fully relativistic derivation of the pairing force has been developed , starting from the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) . using the gorkov factorization technique , it has been possible to demonstrate that the pairing interaction results from the one - meson exchange ( @xmath11- , @xmath12- and @xmath13-mesons ) . in practice , however , it turns out that the pairing correlations calculated in this way , with coupling constants taken from standard parameter sets of the rmf model , are much too strong .",
    "the repulsion produced by the exchange of vector mesons at short distances results in a pairing gap at the fermi surface that is by a factor three too large .",
    "however , as has been argued in many applications of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory , there is no real reason to use the same effective forces in both the particle - hole and particle - particle channel . in a first - order approximation ,",
    "the effective interaction contained in the mean - field @xmath40 is a @xmath68-matrix , the sum over all ladder diagrams .",
    "the effective force in the @xmath69 channel , i.e. in the pairing potential @xmath41 , should be the @xmath70 matrix , the sum of all diagrams irreducible in @xmath69-direction . since very little is known about this matrix in the relativistic approach , in most applications of the rhb model a phenomenological pairing interaction has been used , the pairing part of the gogny force @xcite , @xmath71 with the set d1s @xcite for the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "this force has been very carefully adjusted to the pairing properties of finite nuclei all over the periodic table .",
    "in particular , the basic advantage of the gogny force is the finite range , which automatically guarantees a proper cut - off in momentum space .",
    "the fact that it is a non - relativistic interaction has little influence on the results of rhb calculations .",
    "a relativistic pairing force should include both a lorentz - scalar and a lorentz - vector part , as for example the interactions derived in refs .",
    "however , as opposed to the mean - field @xmath78 , where the contribution of the small components in the dirac spinors is reflected in a very large spin - orbit splitting and where the difference between the scalar density ( [ equ.2.3.e ] ) and the vector density ( [ equ.2.3.f ] ) leads to saturation , the contribution of these components in the pairing channel can be neglected to a very good approximation . in the pairing channel only levels in the vicinity of the fermi surface are really important , or in other words , pairing is a completely non - relativistic effect .    in order to test the combination of the nl3 effective interaction for the mean - field lagrangian , and the gogny interaction with the parameter d1s in the pairing channel , ground - state properties of a chain of ni and sn isotopes",
    "have been calculated in ref .",
    "the analysis has shown that the nl3 effective force provides an accurate description of systems with very different number of neutrons .",
    "the correct isospin dependence of nl3 implies that this interaction can be used to make reliable predictions about drip - line nuclei . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the one- and two - neutron separation energies are shown for the sn ( @xmath79 ) isotopes .",
    "the values that correspond to the self - consistent rhb ground - states are compared with experimental data and extrapolated values from ref .",
    "the theoretical values reproduce in detail the experimental separation energies .",
    "the model describes not only the empirical values within one major neutron shell , but it also reproduces the transitions between major shells .",
    "the agreement with experimental data is also very good for the ni isotopes . for the total binding energies , except for the region around @xmath80ni and for @xmath81sn , the absolute differences between the calculated and experimental masses are less than 2 mev . for ni",
    "the model predicts weaker binding for @xmath82 . compared to experimental values ,",
    "the theoretical binding energies are @xmath83 1 mev larger for neutrons in the 1g@xmath84 orbital ( @xmath85 ) . for sn isotopes the results of model calculation in general display stronger binding .",
    "the differences are somewhat larger for @xmath81sn , but for these nuclei it is expected that the masses might be strongly affected by proton - neutron residual short - range correlations .",
    "excellent results have also been obtained in the comparison between calculated and experimental neutron and proton rms radii for the ni and sn isotopes .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that constrained rmf calculations with the nl3 effective force reproduce the excitation energies of superdeformed minima relative to the ground - state in @xmath86hg and @xmath86pb . in the same work",
    "the nl3 interaction was also used for calculations of binding energies and deformation parameters of rare - earth nuclei .",
    "all theoretical analyses have shown that the combination nl3 @xmath87 d1s could be expected to predict relevant results also in the regions of drip - line nuclei .",
    "in all the applications of the rhb model which are described in the present review , the nl3 effective force has been used in the mean - field lagrangian , and the gogny d1s interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction plays a central role in nuclear structure .",
    "it is rooted in the basis of the nuclear shell model , where its inclusion is essential in order to reproduce the experimentally established magic numbers . in non - relativistic models based on the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the spin - orbit potential is included in a phenomenological way .",
    "of course such an ansatz introduces an additional parameter : the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the value of this parameter is usually adjusted to the experimental spin - orbit splittings in spherical nuclei , for example @xmath88o . on the other hand , in the relativistic framework",
    "the nucleons are described as dirac spinors .",
    "this means that in the relativistic description of the nuclear many - body problem , the spin - orbit interaction arises naturally from the dirac - lorenz structure of the effective lagrangian .",
    "no additional strength parameter is necessary , and relativistic models reproduce the empirical spin - orbit splittings .",
    "it is then of special interest to study the predictions of the relativistic model for the isovector properties of the spin - orbit term of the effective interaction @xcite . in the first order approximation , and assuming spherical symmetry , the spin - orbit term can be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the spin - orbit potential  @xcite . @xmath91",
    "v and s denote the repulsive vector and the attractive scalar potentials , respectively .",
    "@xmath92 is the effective mass @xmath93    using the vector and scalar potentials from the self - consistent ground - state solutions , from  ( [ so1 ] ) - ( [ so3 ] ) the corresponding spin - orbit terms have been computed for the ni isotopes .",

    "[ fig2 ] as function of the radial distance from the center of the nucleus .",
    "the magnitude of the spin - orbit term @xmath94 decreases with the number of neutrons .",
    "if @xmath95ni with @xmath96ni are compared , the reduction is @xmath97 in the surface region .",
    "this implies a significant weakening of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the minimum of @xmath94 is also shifted outwards , and this reflects the larger spatial extension of the scalar and vector densities , which become very diffuse on the surface .",
    "the effect is stronger in light nuclei @xcite , while it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the reduction of the spin - orbit term seems to be less pronounced in the sn isotopes .",
    "these results indicate that the weakening of the spin - orbit interaction might not be that important in heavy nuclei . the effect is reflected in the calculated energy splittings between spin - orbit partners .",
    "the gradual decrease of the energy gap between single - particle levels is consistent with the weakening of the spin - orbit term of the effective interaction .",
    "in some loosely bound systems at the drip - lines , the neutron density distribution displays an extremely long tail : the neutron halo .",
    "the resulting large interaction cross sections have provided the first experimental evidence for halo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the neutron halo phenomenon has been studied with a variety of theoretical models  @xcite . for very light nuclei in particular ,",
    "models based on the separation into core plus valence space nucleons ( three - body borromean systems ) have been employed . in heavier neutron - rich nuclei one",
    "expects that mean - field models should provide a better description of ground - state properties . in a mean - field description , the neutron halo and the stability against nucleon emission",
    "can only be explained with the inclusion of pairing correlations .",
    "both the properties of single - particle states near the neutron fermi level , and the pairing interaction , are important in the formation of the neutron halo .",

    "the model predicts the formation of neutron skin , and eventually neutron halo in ne and na .",

    "when the neutron single - particle levels are displayed as function of the number of protons , it turns out that the binding of neutrons is determined by the 1f@xmath104 orbital which is found to be parallel to the slope of the fermi level .",

    "the microscopic mechanism through which additional neutrons are bound to the core originates from the increase in magnitude of the spin - orbit term in presence of the @xmath117 particle .",
    "the @xmath117 in its ground state produces only a fractional change in the central mean - field potential . on the other hand , through a purely relativistic effect , it notably changes the spin - orbit term in the surface region , providing additional binding for the outermost neutrons .",
    "the effect can be illustrated on on the example of @xmath102ne and the corresponding hypernucleus @xmath118ne .",
    "the mean field potential , in which the nucleons move , results from the cancelation of two large meson potentials : the attractive scalar potential s and the repulsive vector potential v : v+s .",
    "the spin - orbit potential , on the other hand , arises from the very strong anti - nucleon potential v - s .",
    "therefore , while in the presence of the @xmath117 the changes in v and s cancel out in the mean - field potential , they are amplified in @xmath90 . for the core @xmath102ne the values of the scalar ( s ) and vector ( v ) potential in the center of the nucleus are -380 mev and 308 mev , respectively .",
    "for @xmath118ne the corresponding values are : -412 mev and 336 mev .",
    "the addition of the @xmath117 particle changes the value of the mean - field potential in the center of the nucleus by 4 mev , but it changes the anti - nucleon potential by 60 mev .",
    "this is reflected in the corresponding spin - orbit term of the effective potential , which provides more binding for states close to the fermi surface .",
    "the additional binding stabilizes the hypernuclear core .",

    "<S> we present a review of recent applications of the relativistic mean - field theory to the structure of nuclei close to the drip - lines . for systems with extreme isospin values </S>",
    "<S> , the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model provides a unified and self - consistent description of mean - field and pairing correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the model has been applied in studies of structure phenomena that include : formation of neutron skin and of neutron halos in light nuclei in the mass region above the s - d neutron shell , the strong isospin dependence of the effective spin - orbit interaction and the resulting modification of surface properties , the suppression of the spherical @xmath0 shell gap for neutron - rich nuclei and the related phenomenon of deformation and shape coexistence , the proton drip - line in the spherical nuclei @xmath1 , and ground - state proton radioactivity in the region of deformed nuclei @xmath2 . </S>"
