    "the on - going research and interest in colloidal ncs over the past three decades is partly driven by the prospect of building low cost , high quality and highly efficient lighting or light harvesting devices,@xcite such as colloidal nc based light emitting diodes @xcite or solar cells,@xcite and partly by the opportunities opened up due to the high expertise in synthesis methods , enabling one to produce ncs of almost arbitrary size and shape .",
    "a vast improvement regarding the optical properties of ncs has been the introduction of a shell , resulting in effective passivation of surface trap states of the nc core , thereby considerably improving the quantum yield.@xcite it has been also shown that the shell provides the possibility to manipulate the confinement of electrons and holes separately enabling to tailor their wavefunction overlap and thereby to control their interaction.@xcite in that way further improvement of the optical properties of ncs can be obtained .    at low temperatures the light emission from ncs is predominantly determined by the exciton fine structure , which in wurtzite type ncs arises from the interplay of the crystal lattice anisotropy , the nc shape and the electron - hole exchange interaction.@xcite due to its importance for the radiative emission of ncs the exciton fine structure has been studied theoretically and experimentally for various nc materials , sizes and shapes , such as spherical core - only and core / shell ncs,@xcite nanorods @xcite and dot - in - rods ( dirs).@xcite    in spherical ncs the most crucial feature of the exciton fine structure is that the ground exciton state has total angular momentum @xmath0 and is therefore optically forbidden in the electric - dipole approximation , i.e. is a dark state .",
    "optically active states with @xmath1 are split from the dark state typically by a couple of mev to higher energies .",
    "this splitting is often referred to as the bright - dark energy splitting and its magnitude depends on the electron - hole exchange interaction.@xcite notably it has been shown , that by increasing the cds shell thickness due to the electron leakage into the shell the electron - hole exchange interaction and thereby the magnitude of the bright - dark splitting can be controlled.@xcite in contrast , recent experiments on dirs indicate , that the shape of the cds shell does not significantly affect the level order in the exciton fine structure for the core sizes of interest here.@xcite while in bare anisotropic structures , such as nanorods , a change in the order of the valence subbands may occur at a certain diameter , leading to an exciton ground state with total angular momentum of @xmath2,@xcite the fine structure of dirs appears to be similar to the spherical case .",
    "the order of the fine structure states is crucial for the photoluminescence ( pl ) polarization of the nc , especially at low temperatures , where the thermal energy is smaller than the fine structure splitting and mostly the lowest lying exciton states contribute to radiative recombination . while for dir ncs",
    "high degrees of linear polarization of the pl have been experimentally observed at elevated temperatures,@xcite corresponding studies at low temperatures are still missing .",
    "the recombination dynamics of ncs is controlled by transitions between exciton fine structure states involving energy and spin relaxation . in order to conserve energy and angular momentum ,",
    "these transitions are accompanied by absorption or emission of phonons . however , since phonons alone do not flip spins additional mechanisms for spin relaxation are required .",
    "understanding these mechanisms is important because it enables design of spin - preserving environments for future spin - based devices in information storage.@xcite colloidal ncs , due to their high versatility regarding synthesis and processing as well as their unique and widely tunable optical properties are appealing candidates for such applications.@xcite thus , comprehensive knowledge about the linkage between nc size , shape and material properties and exciton spin dynamics is highly desirable . in recent experiments , exciton spin relaxation and its dependence on the nc shape",
    "have been addressed and possible mechanisms involved have been discussed .",
    "@xcite however , in these studies the authors consider only exciton relaxation for bright - to - bright and bright - to - dark states and the experiments have been conducted at elevated temperatures .",
    "transitions between the dark exciton ground states , which become important at low temperatures and occur in the presence of external perturbations , such as an external magnetic field , have not been discussed so far . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", the dark exciton due to its long lifetime is a promising candidate for long - lived spin storage applications .    in this paper , we present a detailed study of exciton spin dynamics and pl polarization in cdse / cds core / shell nc ensembles subject to an external magnetic field .",
    "we report on how the spin dynamics between the dark exciton ground states split by the magnetic field is affected by the size and shape of the cds shell . to this end",
    "we measure the time - resolved degree of circular polarization ( dcp ) as function of temperature and magnetic field for ncs covering a wide range of shapes and sizes , including dirs as well as spherical core - only and core / shell ncs .",
    "interestingly we find that the core / shell interface strongly affects the spin relaxation rate , whereas the shell shape and size have only slight impact in this regard .",
    "these results highlight the crucial role of the core / shell interface for the optical properties of ncs , especially for the relaxation and recombination dynamics of dark excitons . moreover , our results suggest that the spin flip is accompanied by the emission of confined acoustic phonons and remarkably ncs of spherical shape show a behavior similar to dirs in this regard .",
    "we also study the impact of the shell shape on the pl circular polarization induced by the magnetic field . on the one hand",
    "we show that by measuring the pl - dcp one can probe the orientation of dir ensembles , which after drop - casting on a substrate can show macroscopic alignment features in so - called  coffee stain rings.@xcite on the other hand , we analyze the dependence of the pl - dcp on magnetic field for dirs and spherical core / shell ncs .",
    "our results indicate , that the saturation level of the dcp in dirs depends on the aspect ratio of the dir shell .",
    "we elaborate a theoretical approach for analyzing and predicting the polarization properties of ncs in the presence of an external magnetic field , which includes a dielectric enhancement effect resulting from the anisotropic shell as well as phonon - mediated coupling of the dark exciton ground state to bright exciton states with radiative transitions parallel and perpendicular to the hexagonal axis .",
    "interestingly our model suggests that , although at high temperatures the pl of dir may be polarized along the hexagonal axis , at low temperatures and in the presence of magnetic fields it can be polarized perpendicular to it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ experimentals ] information on the synthesis of the ncs is given and the experimental setup is described . in section [ experimentalresults ]",
    "the experimental results are presented and discussed . here",
    ", we start with a general discussion about how the orientation of wurtzite type ncs affects the circular polarization in magnetic field and we present results of measurements , in which such orientation effects are observed .",
    "subsequently we explain the experimental procedure for investigating the exciton spin dynamics and the equilibrium pl - dcp .",
    "thereafter results on the spin dynamics and dcp are presented and discussed . in section [ theorypart ] the theory for describing the pl circular and linear polarization of dirs in external magnetic field is presented and compared to the experimental data .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary and an outlook in section [ outlook ] .",
    "the wurtzite cdse cores and the cdse / cds dir colloidal ncs were prepared following the protocol described in ref .  .",
    "in this method , the use of phosphonic acids for the seeded growth of the cds shell results in an anisotropic growth of the shell around the spherical core .",
    "the spherical cdse / cds ncs were prepared starting from the same wurtzite cdse cores by using the recently reported  flash ",
    "synthesis.@xcite this method makes use of oleic acid instead of phosphonic acids , which promotes an isotropic growth of the cds shell and results in a spherical morphology of the core / shell ncs .",

    "the geometrical parameters are illustrated by the top sketches .",
    "the sizes of the cdse / cds dirs and spherical core / shell ncs were determined from such tem images .",
    "the size of the bare cdse cores was determined from the energy of the first peak in the absorption spectrum , using published data for the size dependence of the optical transitions.@xcite        for magneto - optical photoluminescence measurements , a solution of ncs in toluene with a concentration of a few @xmath3 m was deposited by drop - casting onto a glass slide and afterwards dried . for low temperature experiments",
    "the samples were mounted into an optical cryostat with direct optical assess to the sample via windows .",
    "the temperature could be varied between @xmath4  k and 20  k. the cryostat is equipped with a superconducting solenoid for generating magnetic fields up to 15  t. the magnetic field , @xmath5 , was applied in faraday geometry , i.e. , parallel to the light wave vector and perpendicular to the sample substrate .",
    "the sample was mounted on a holder top attached to a nanopositioner system , allowing for precise positioning in the three spatial directions .",
    "nc photoluminescence was excited with a linearly - polarized pulsed diode laser ( pulse duration of about 100  ps ) , operating at a wavelength of 405  nm ( photon energy of 3.06  ev ) at a repetition rate of 1  mhz .",
    "the photoluminescence was detected either with an avalanche photodiode ( time resolution of 100  ps ) or spectrally - resolved by a monochromator connected to a nitrogen - cooled charge - coupled device camera .",
    "the overall time resolution of the setup was determined to be 250  ps .",
    "the circular polarization of the pl was analyzed using a quarter wave plate and a glan - thomson - prism .",

    "the spectral dependence of the dcp is shown in fig .",

    "it changes only slightly across the pl band , which may be due to variation of the nc parameters or contribution of spectral diffusion . here",
    "we will not go into the details of these variations so that we can use spectrally - integrated pl intensities for calculation of the dcp .",
    "the observed polarization is result of an exciton distribution among the zeeman - split sublevels , as illustrated in the inset of fig .",

    "the exciton spin is constrained to orientations along the hexagonal c - axis of the crystal.@xcite as a result , the magnitude of the exciton zeeman splitting depends on the angle @xmath13 between the crystal c - axis and the direction of the magnetic field : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the exciton @xmath16 factor and @xmath17 is the bohr magneton .",

    "for an ensemble of randomly oriented ncs the angle @xmath13 between the crystal c - axis and the magnetic field direction is equally distributed over all angles between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", the integration over all angles @xmath13 leads to a theoretical limit for @xmath34 of 0.75 ( i.e. @xmath35  % ) .",
    "however , for ncs with an anisotropic shape , such as nanorods or dirs the situation can be different .",
    "for dir ncs it is known that the c - axis of the core is typically parallel to the long axis of the rod.@xcite several methods have turned out to be suitable to prepare nanorod ensembles with macroscopic alignment.@xcite magnetooptical spectroscopy can be used for reliable characterization of the nanorod orientation in the ensemble by measuring @xmath34 , as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ bdependence ] ) . in the case",
    "when all nanorods are oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field direction , i.e. @xmath36 , the expected dcp at any magnetic field @xmath37 . on the contrary , when all nanorods are oriented along the magnetic field , i.e. @xmath38 , the resulting @xmath34 is maximal and depends only on the ratio @xmath39 .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath40 .",
    "for fully spin polarized excitons @xmath41 .    as a proof of principle we used this method to probe the nanorod orientation in ensembles prepared by the drop - casting method .",
    "when a solution of highly concentrated ncs is drop - casted on a substrate , its distribution on the substrate is subject to the so called `` coffee stain effect''.@xcite due to this effect the nanoparticles accumulate in the outermost part of the drying droplet , leading to the formation of a coffee stain ring , where the ncs are densely packed . as it was shown in ref .   in these coffee stain rings",
    "nanorods can align macroscopically .",
    "namely , they tend to be oriented parallel to each other and parallel to the substrate , whereas in the regions outside the ring the nanorods show no specific order and their orientation is random .",
    "figure  [ figure3](a ) shows a pl intensity scan of a coffee stain ring section for sample  # 5 measured by a confocal laser scanning microscopy with a spatial resolution of @xmath42 m .",
    "the spectrally - integrated pl intensity is plotted using a logarithmic grey scale with the brightness increasing with intensity .",
    "the high intensity within the ring supports the dense packing of nanorods in this area . in the inner part of the ring ( grey area )",
    "the nanorod density is substantially smaller . outside the ring",
    "the intensity is almost zero but still measurable ( black area ) . to obtain more insight the pl intensity profile along the red line in fig .",
    "[ figure3](a ) is shown by the solid circles in fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) .",
    "the time - integrated dcp at @xmath43  t for the scan across the ring is also shown in this figure by the open circles .",
    "it is remarkable , that the dcp value being @xmath44 inside the ring drops almost to zero on the ring .",
    "this decrease clearly evidences the nanorod alignment parallel to the substrate surface resulting from the vanishing exciton zeeman splitting for the magnetic field perpendicular to the c - axis of the majority of nanorods .",
    "note that the time - integrated dcp in general is lower than @xmath45 .",
    "however , if the spin relaxation time is much shorter than the exciton recombination time this difference becomes negligible.@xcite it will be shown below that this is always the case for the samples investigated here .",
    "the technique presented is suitable to yield information about the nanorod orientation only with respect to the magnetic field axis perpendicular to the sample substrate .",
    "although it can not compete with electron microscopy in terms of resolution , it has noteworthy advantages .",
    "while for tem imaging special carbon grids , which are transparent to the electron beams , have to be used , the method we propose is applicable to a wide range of substrate materials and can be used for device characterization . furthermore , while the area available to tem is typically limited to a few microns , the optical technique can be applied to much larger scales .",
    "its spatial resolution is limited to several hundred nanometers due to light diffraction , depending on the laser wavelength and the numerical aperture of the optical excitation and detection system .      in the preceding section",
    "we have highlighted the impact of the nanorod orientation on the magnetic - field - induced dcp in dir nanocrystals .",
    "therefore , when investigating the magneto - optical properties , this aspect has to be taken into account . in order to ensure comparability between different samples ,",
    "all measurements presented in the following were performed in the center of the dried droplets , where no specific order of the dir particles is expected .",
    "the internal crystal structure and nc shape anisotropy , in combination with the electron - hole exchange interaction , lift the eight - fold degeneracy of the exciton ground state , leading to an exciton fine structure consisting of five energy levels , which are distinguished by their total angular momentum.@xcite at low temperatures it is typically sufficient to consider only the lowest exciton states when discussing the optical properties of ncs .",
    "it was shown in previous studies @xcite that the exciton fine structure of dirs for the core sizes of interest here is quite similar to the case of spherical core / shell ncs .",
    "a sketch of the lowest fine structure states is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4](a ) without and in presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the lowest exciton ground state @xmath46 has total angular momentum of @xmath47 and is optically forbidden . it lies below an optically allowed state @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the bright - dark energy splitting @xmath50 is strongly dependent on the shell thickness , because a change in shell thickness leads to a modified electron - hole exchange interaction .",
    "this aspect was investigated in several experimental studies.@xcite for the samples we investigate here the magnitude of @xmath50 lies in the range of @xmath51  mev.@xcite at low temperatures pl emission occurs mainly from the dark state , due to efficient spin flip scattering from the bright to the dark exciton state , which occurs on picosecond timescale.@xcite dark exciton radiative recombination is a long standing question and its origin has not been fully disclosed .",
    "several reports evidenced a phonon - assisted mechanism involving longitudinal optical and longitudinal acoustic phonons .",
    "this , however , can not explain some peculiar experimental observations , such as presence of the zero phonon line @xcite or shortening of the pl decay with increasing external magnetic field.@xcite    in the presence of a magnetic field the exciton states are split into zeeman doublets with well - defined spin orientation . at low temperatures the establishment of thermal equilibrium population among the exciton spin sublevels involves the bright - dark spin relaxation characterized by a time @xmath52 and the spin relaxation between the zeeman sublevels of the bright and dark excitons .",
    "since exciton relaxation between @xmath53 and @xmath54 requires a simultaneous spin flip of electron and hole , it is expected that this process is less efficient compared to the bright to dark exciton relaxation , i.e. @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the spin relaxation time of the dark exciton.@xcite the spin relaxation between the @xmath53 and @xmath54 states is the main focus of this study .",
    "the spin dynamics can be investigated by analyzing the time - resolved dcp @xmath57 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4](b ) .",
    "after pulsed excitation , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 polarized components are traced as function of time .",
    "the time - resolved dcp , which is shown by the black curve , is calculated from the experimental data after eq .",
    "( [ dcpintensities ] ) .",
    "right after excitation the pl is unpolarized , because the photoexcited excitons being excited with linearly polarized ( unpolarized ) laser light with large excess energy do not have a preferential spin orientation . subsequently the excitons relax into the energetically lower lying spin states until they achieve thermal equilibrium , as evidenced by the plateau of the dcp in fig .",
    "[ figure4](b ) .",
    "the characteristic time of the spin relaxation process involved can be quantified by determining the characteristic rise time of the time - resolved dcp.@xcite in the following we analyze the dependence of the pl polarization and spin dynamics on magnetic field , temperature and shape of the ncs . to that end , we fit the time - resolved dcp curves with the equation @xmath58 , \\label{fit}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes the dcp in thermal equilibrium and @xmath56 the spin relaxation time of the dark exciton . a typical fit is shown by the green curve in fig .

    "on the one hand , as the temperature is kept constant and the magnetic field is increased , the dcp saturates at higher values , due to the increased magnitude of the zeeman splitting . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin relaxation process becomes more efficient , as can be seen from the faster dcp increase at higher fields . if the magnetic field strength is fixed and the temperature is increased , the saturation level decreases due to thermal population of the higher lying zeeman - sublevel resulting in a lower degree of spin polarization . in contrast the spin relaxation efficiency increases with increasing temperature , as one can see from the shortening of the dcp rise time in fig .",
    "[ figure4](d ) . in the following",
    "we will first discuss the spin dynamics and will later focus on the dependences of @xmath59 on magnetic field and nc shape .",
    "in this part the exciton spin dynamics and its dependence on magnetic field , temperature and nc shape is discussed .",
    "first , we want to stress that the observed dynamics of the @xmath57 curve of sample # 1 in fig .",
    "[ figure4](b ) originates predominantly from relaxation between the dark exciton @xmath0 states .",
    "the plateau , which is reached at @xmath61  ns clearly indicates thermally equilibrated excitons among the zeeman - split fine structure states . the characteristic rise time obtained from the fit of the experimental @xmath57 dependence with eq .   is @xmath62  ns in this case ( @xmath43  t and @xmath63  k ) .",
    "the thermalization of excitons among the bright and dark states was studied in detail in ref .  .",
    "notably , this study revealed a strong size dependence of the thermalization time that was found to depend linearly on the square of the nc radius . at temperature @xmath64  k for ncs with a radius below @xmath65",
    "nm the thermalization was found to occur on timescales @xmath66  ps . considering the range of sizes in our set of samples , we expect the bright to dark thermalization to occur on a similar timescale .",
    "this is more than one order of magnitude shorter than the typical spin relaxation times we determine in our experiments , especially at low magnetic fields .",
    "we believe that we are not able to resolve the dynamics on such a short timescale due to the limited resolution of our setup ( @xmath67  ps ) . however , since @xmath57 at @xmath68 is equal to zero , we suggest , that the relative population of the zeeman - split bright states is equal , i.e. no thermalization takes place at such short timescales . as a result",
    "this equal population is transferred onto the dark states .",
    "consequently , it is very likely that the dynamics of @xmath57 at early times arises from the relaxation between the @xmath53 and @xmath54 dark exciton states .",
    "figures  [ figure5](a ) and [ figure5](b ) show the spin relaxation rate @xmath69 , obtained for sample # 1 from the fit of the time - resolved dcp curves with eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) , as function of magnetic field and temperature .",
    "examples of such fits are shown by the red lines in figs .",

    "[ figure5 ]  ( a ) , the spin relaxation rate is strongly dependent on the magnetic field . at @xmath63",
    "k the rate increases from @xmath70  ns@xmath71 to @xmath72  ns@xmath71 ( this corresponds to a shortening of the relaxation time from @xmath73  ns to @xmath74  ns ) with increasing magnetic field from @xmath6  t to @xmath24  t. as one can see in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure5](a ) , at low magnetic fields the spin relaxation rate follows a cubic magnetic field dependence and it starts to deviate from this trend at @xmath75  t. at high fields the rate seems to depend linearly on magnetic field .",

    "[ figure6](a ) the magnetic field dependences of the spin relaxation rate are shown for all studied dir samples as well as the spherical samples # r1 and # r3 .",
    "all of them show qualitatively the same trend , i.e. at low fields the spin relaxation rate follows a cubic dependence , as shown for selected samples in fig .",
    "[ figure6](b ) , while at higher fields a linear magnetic field dependence is observed . however , the spin relaxation rate seems to be strongly dependent on the core size and independent of the shell shape .",

    "[ figure6](a ) , which belong to the spherical ncs # r1 and dirs with a core size of @xmath80  nm . although their shell shapes are totally different , the measured spin relaxation rates are quite similar .",
    "this absence of shell shape dependence for the spin relaxation rate allows us to draw interesting conclusions to be discussed in the following .",
    "the sensitivity of the spin relaxation rate on temperature suggests an acoustic phonon mediated process . due to the increasing number of available phonons with increasing temperature",
    "the spin relaxation becomes more efficient .",
    "however , in contrast to bulk material , the phonon density of states in ncs is modified by confinement , as it has been confirmed in many experiments.@xcite this leads to the ",
    "acoustic phonon bottleneck,@xcite meaning that low - energy , long - wavelength acoustic phonons are suppressed in nanometer - sized structures . due to the similar elastic properties of cdse and cds it is expected that the phonon confinement is different in dirs compared to spherical ncs .",
    "namely the lower confinement along the rod axis presumably gives rise to longitudinal modes in addition to the torsional and spheroidal eigenmodes observed in spherical structures.@xcite this raises the question whether the phonon modes , which couple to the excitons , are considerably different in dir structures compared to the spherical case . in this respect",
    "we infer from the data presented in fig .",
    "[ figure6](a ) that if acoustic phonons play a crucial role regarding the efficiency of the spin relaxation mechanism , the shell shape does not lead to a significantly changed number of phonon modes , which interact with the exciton .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the results of a recent experimental study employing fluorescent line narrowing ( fln ) on dirs in magnetic field .",
    "@xcite therein the authors found that the acoustic phonon modes of dir nanostructures involved in exciton recombination in presence of a magnetic field are similar to those of confined modes in an isolated spherical nc .",
    "following the preceding line of thought , the magnetic field dependence of the spin relaxation rate could partly be explained in terms of the phonon bottleneck .",
    "for all studied samples the magnetic field dependence can be divided into two regimes . in the low field regime",
    "the relaxation rate follows a cubic dependence , whereas at higher fields the dependence becomes linear . on",
    "the other hand one can claim that at higher fields the slope of the spin relaxation rate dependence is increased compared to lower fields .",
    "the onset of this increase occurs at @xmath81  t. assuming an average angle between the magnetic field and the crystal c - axis of @xmath82 and taking @xmath83 for the dark exciton @xmath16 factor,@xcite the corresponding zeeman splitting amounts to @xmath84  mev .",
    "this energy matches roughly the vibrational energy of the @xmath85 spheroidal mode of a cdse sphere with a diameter of @xmath86  nm as estimated according to lamb s theory.@xcite we propose that the observed change in the magnetic field dependence results from the onset of these spheroidal vibrations at magnetic fields around @xmath87  t. although the core diameter of the samples studied here is considerably smaller than @xmath86  nm , we think that due to the similar elastic properties of cdse and cds , the overall size of the shell might be relevant in this regard.@xcite in the lamb theory the energy of the spheroidal modes scales as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the sphere diameter .",
    "we therefore expect , that for larger ncs the onset of the linear magnetic field dependence should occur at lower fields . however , we are not able to verify such a trend from our data .",
    "nevertheless we would like to stress , that our interpretation is in accordance with the findings of a recent magneto - optical experiment on trions in cdse / cds core / shell ncs , where the spin relaxation was found to be completely inhibited for small zeeman splitting , as a result of the acoustic phonon confinement.@xcite     for spherical ncs # r2-#r5 with different shell thicknesses and similar core size of 2.7  nm . ]    the red data points in fig .",
    "[ figure6](a ) , which belong to dir samples with core diameter @xmath90  nm , indicate that the shell thickness might have a small effect on the spin relaxation rate .",
    "with increasing shell thickness the spin relaxation rate decreases slightly at a given magnetic field . in order to investigate this effect more systematically , we studied the set of spherical ncs # r2-#r5 , which have similar core sizes but different shell thicknesses .",
    "sample # r2 consists of bare cdse cores .",
    "the corresponding magnetic field dependences of the spin relaxation rates are shown in fig .",

    "additional dedicated measurements at low temperatures are necessary to elucidate the relevance and the magnitude of each parameter and their dependences on nc size and shape . especially the determination of the linear polarization properties of individual dirs at low temperatures and in magnetic fields would be highly enlightening in this regard .",
    "nevertheless , we believe , that these findings may lead to a deeper understanding of the processes related to the exciton fine structure and the resulting polarization properties of the emitted light .",
    "finally , we would like to point out , that also for spherical core / shell ncs saturation dcp values considerably lower than the theoretically expected @xmath97 have been observed in high magnetic field experiments and these low dcps could not be explained at that time.@xcite however , they could be explained in the framework of our theory , if one considers , that also in spherical core / shell ncs the coupling to the @xmath115 state is relevant .",
    "this would intrinsically lower the saturation value of the dcp in the ensemble as discussed in connection with fig .",
    "[ figure13 ] . furthermore",
    ", real ncs are never perfectly spherical , which makes it necessary to consider also the dielectric enhancement effect for these structures .",
    "in summary , we performed a comprehensive study of the pl polarization and exciton spin dynamics in cdse / cds core / shell ncs in external magnetic field .",
    "we demonstrated the possibility of probing the orientation of ncs with anisotropic shell shape with respect to the magnetic field axis by measuring the pl dcp induced by the field , and highlighted possible applications of this technique for testing nanorod based arrays .",
    "regarding exciton spin dynamics we found that the spin relaxation of dark excitons is strongly related to the surface of cdse in bare ncs or the interface between cdse and cds in core / shell systems .",
    "this was evidenced by a large decrease of the spin relaxation rate after adding a cds shell .",
    "the importance of the interface in core / shell systems was highlighted by a strong core size dependence of the spin relaxation rate , which decreases for increasing core volume .",
    "in contrast , the overall nc surface seems to play only a minor role in this regard , as concluded from the weak dependence of the spin relaxation rate on shell thickness .",
    "the temperature and magnetic field dependences of the spin relaxation rate emphasize the importance of confined acoustic phonons in the relaxation and recombination of dark excitons . in this respect ,",
    "dir ncs show a similar behaviour as spherical core / shell systems .",
    "we believe , that these findings may stimulate further discussion about the role of the core / shell interface for the optical properties , in particular the dark exciton recombination and spin relaxation in ncs . with respect to applications",
    "our results on spin dynamics may help to figure out the relevant parameters for spin - preserving environments in spintronics devices , e.g. for spin storage . in respect thereof we can state , that adding a shell for surface passivation and the use of large core ncs as well as thick shells favor long spin lifetimes .",
    "finally , we extensively studied the circular pl polarization of dirs in magnetic field . despite a remarkably low equilibrium dcp for randomly oriented dirs compared to spherical core / shell",
    "ncs our results point towards the dependence of the saturated dcp on the nc aspect ratio .",
    "we elaborated a theory for analyzing and predicting the circular and linear polarization properties of dir emission .",
    "it includes the dielectric enhancement effect as well as dark exciton recombination via coupling to bright exciton states with radiative transitions polarized parallel or perpendicular to the hexagonal c - axis .",
    "this model can explain the strongly varying ( almost saturated ) dcps typically observed even for spherical ncs in high magnetic fields and may lead to a better understanding of the exciton fine structure and its relevance for the pl polarization properties of ncs especially at low temperatures .",
