    "very recently , a `` purely human '' ( _ i.e. _ , computer - free ) proof of the algebraicity of the full generating function @xmath49 was given by bostan , kurkova and raschel  @xcite .",

    "a different type of explicit expressions ( integral representations ) for the generating function of gessel walks was obtained by kurkova and raschel  @xcite .",
    "their approach was later generalized by raschel  @xcite to all the 74 nonsingular walks . finally , bostan , chyzak , van hoeij , kauers and pech  @xcite used computer algebra tools to express all d - finite transcendental functions @xmath16 by iterated integrals of gaussian hypergeometric functions .      concerning asymptotics ,",
    "conjectural results were given by bostan and kauers @xcite for the coefficients of @xmath12 when this function is d - finite .",

    "explicit asymptotics for the coefficients of @xmath15 and @xmath12 were conjectured even in non - d - finite cases in some unpublished tables  @xcite . in a recent work , denisov and wachtel",
    "@xcite have obtained explicit expressions for the asymptotics of excursions @xmath15 in a much broader setting ; in particular , their results provide ( up to a constant ) the dominating term in the asymptotics of the @xmath10-th coefficient of @xmath15 in terms of the step set .",
    "even more recently , fayolle and raschel  @xcite showed that the dominant singularities of @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath12 are algebraic numbers , and announced more general and precise results about asymptotics of coefficients of @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , a combinatorial approach is proposed by johnson , mishna and yeats  @xcite that allows to find tight bounds on the dominant singularities of the latter generating functions .",
    "in the present work , we prove the non - d - finiteness of the generating function of @xmath13-excursions @xmath15 for all 51 cases of nonsingular walks with infinite group . as a corollary , we deduce the non - d - finiteness of the full generating function @xmath16 for those cases since d - finiteness is preserved by specialization at  ( 0,0 )  @xcite .",
    "this corollary has been already obtained by kurkova and raschel  @xcite , but the approach here is at the same time simpler , and delivers a more accurate information .",
    "this new proof only uses asymptotic information about the coefficients of @xmath15 , and arithmetic information about the constrained behavior of the asymptotics of these coefficients when their generating function is d - finite .",
    "more precisely , we first make explicit consequences of the general results by denisov and wachtel  @xcite in the case of walks in the quarter plane .",
    "if @xmath56 denotes the number of @xmath13-excursions of length @xmath10 using only steps in  @xmath5 , this analysis implies that , when @xmath10 tends to infinity , @xmath57 behaves like @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a real number , @xmath60 is an algebraic number , and @xmath61 is a real number such that @xmath62 is an algebraic number .",
