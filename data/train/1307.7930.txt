    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the behavior of dirichlet eigenvalues in varying domains , when a shrinking cylindrical handle is attached to a smooth region , seeking not only for the rate of convergence but also for sharp asymptotics . since we consider a tubular handle with a cross - section of radius of order @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) , it is quite natural to expect the rate of convergence of the eigenvalues to rely essentially on the capacity of the junction points and hence to be of order @xmath1 , being @xmath2 the space dimension .",

    "besides the tubular shape of the connecting tube , we require , as a basic assumption to start our analysis , that the handle is attached at a point @xmath13 of @xmath14 where @xmath8 has a zero of order one , i.e. its normal derivative is different from zero .",
    "if moreover @xmath8 is simple and suitably normalized , the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath15 can be continued into a family @xmath16 of eigenvalues corresponding to normalized eigenfunctions @xmath17 on the perturbed domain .",
    "we prove that , in such a setting , there exists the limit @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a positive constant depending only the geometry of the junction section @xmath7 ( see theorems [ teo_asintotico_autovalori ] and [ teo_asintotico_autofunzioni ] below )",
    ". thinking to the eigenfunction @xmath8 as pushed into the channel , we can imagine that a force acts over the junction between the channel and the domain where @xmath8 is supported .",
    "the constant @xmath19 represents indeed the _ compliance _ of the channel s junction , under a constant force concentrated at the junction section ; the compliance , which can be expressed as the @xmath20-norm of the trace of a suitable harmonic function over the channel section , measures the faculty of an elastic membrane to adjust or to resist to a force applied on the section , see for a precise definition .",
    "our proof consists in a sharp differentiation with respect to the parameter , which requires first a careful analysis of the transition functions which have to be attached to @xmath8 in order to push it over the channel . in this way",
    ", we will prove that , once more , @xmath21 where @xmath17 and @xmath8 are trivially extended to the whole @xmath22 .    as an application of the sharp asymptotics we are able to treat also the resonant case : if @xmath23 is a double eigenvalue on the limit disconnected domain which is a simple eigenvalue both on @xmath3 and on @xmath4 , an asymptotics for eigenvalues of type still holds if the limit problem is asymmetrical , e.g. under the assumption that the normal derivatives of the limit eigenfunctions at the junctions are different from each other ( see theorem [ t : reso ] ) . in this case",
    ", it turns out that the splitting of the two subsequent eigenvalues @xmath24 has the polynomial vanishing order @xmath1 ( see remark [ r : splitting_polinomiale ] ) ; such result complements those in @xcite , where it was proved that , in a symmetric dumbbell domain with a shrinking handle , the splitting of the first two eigenvalues vanishes with exponential rate .",
    "moreover , in contrast with @xcite , we can localize each approximating eigenfunction on its corresponding region , up to an exponentially vanishing tail , see theorem [ t : reso_autofun ] .    for expository reasons",
    ", the present paper discusses the effect of attaching a thin handle on the spectral rate of convergence only for dumbbell domains .",
    "however , up to minor modifications , the results obtained here hold true in quite general contexts , since they rely essentially on the attachment of a shrinking handle at a point in which the limit eigenfunction has a zero of order @xmath25 ; therefore the presence / lack of a second domain beyond the channel and its shape seem to be irrelevant for the validity of the asymptotics we are going to derive .",
    "the choice of focusing on the dumbbell structure is motivated not only by the large attention devoted to this peculiar case of singularly perturbed domain in the literature , due to the many interesting related spectral phenomena ( see  [ sec : motiv - refer - liter ] below ) , but also by the fact that some preliminary results required in our analysis have been obtained for dumbbell domains in @xcite , where the singular asymptotic behavior of eigenfunctions at the second junction of the tube is described .      as a paradigmatic example , we consider a dumbbell domain where each `` chamber '' has a constant section , namely we straighten out the handle and assume its section @xmath7 to be constant along its whole length , whereas we spread out the two domains @xmath4 and @xmath3 assuming they are two entire half - spaces , see figure [ fig : dd ] .",
    "we observe that such a simplification of the domain s geometry does not imply a substantial loss of generality if a suitable weight is introduced in the eigenvalue problem under investigation : indeed , the effect of a diffeomorphism transforming a generic dumbbell in a dumbbell with two half - spaces as chambers is the transformation of the eigenvalue problem into a weighted one .",

    "hence , the disk - shaped section of the tube is the one which makes as slow as possible the convergence of the eigenvalues on the perturbed domain to the eigenvalues on the limit domain , as the handle thickness shrinks to zero .",
    "in other words , this means that among all the admissible sections @xmath7 , the disk attains the minimum of the rigidity of the domain @xmath94 : from the opposite point of view , in the case of a round section , the eigenfunctions located in the right domain @xmath4 are the most sensitive to the attachment of the thin handle if compared to the case of more indented sections .",
