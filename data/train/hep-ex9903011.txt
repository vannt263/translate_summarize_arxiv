    "in the standard model of electroweak interactions  @xcite , the quark mass eigenstates are related to the weak eigenstates via the unitary @xmath13 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the nine elements in this matrix , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are completely determined from three angles and a phase .",
    "a nonzero phase gives  violation in the weak interaction .",
    "measurements of decays of hadrons containing @xmath2  quarks ( @xmath6  hadrons ) are of great interest because they determine the magnitudes of five of the nine elements of @xmath14 as well as the phase .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath14 leads to nine unitarity relationships , one of which is of particular interest : @xmath18 in the complex - plane , this sum of three complex numbers is a triangle , commonly referred to as _ the _ unitarity triangle .",
    "measurements of the weak decays of @xmath6  hadrons and the already known ckm matrix elements determine the magnitudes of the three sides of the unitarity triangle , and @xmath19  asymmetries in @xmath6  meson decays determine the three angles .",
    "the primary goal of @xmath6  physics in the next decade is to measure precisely both the sides and angles of this triangle and test consistency within the standard model .",
    "we can use several approximations to express eq .",
    "[ eqn : ut ] in a more convenient form .",
    "the elements @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the cabibbo angle , are well measured . although the elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 are not well measured , the theoretical expectations are that @xmath25 and @xmath26 . with these assumptions , eq .",
    "[ eqn : ut ] becomes @xmath27 measurement of @xmath0 , the subject of this paper , directly impacts the determination of @xmath28 .",
    "second - order weak processes transform a neutral @xmath6  meson into its antiparticle : @xmath31 , giving a probability for a @xmath1 to decay as a @xmath32 that oscillates with time .",
    "the frequency of these oscillations is the mass difference @xmath0 between the @xmath6  mass eigenstates , which are linear combinations of the flavor eigenstates @xmath1 and @xmath32 .",
    "the mass difference is proportional to @xmath33 , so in principle , a measurement of @xmath0 determines this product of ckm  matrix elements . in practice , however , large theoretical uncertainties limit the precision of @xmath29 .",
    "the same problem exists in determining @xmath30 from @xmath34 , the frequency of @xmath35 oscillations .",
    "these theoretical uncertainties are reduced in determining the ratio @xmath36 from @xmath37 .",
    "unfortunately , at this time , attempts to measure @xmath34 have only led to lower limits .",
    "the determination of @xmath34 is a key future measurement of @xmath6  hadrons , since @xmath36 determines the magnitude of one of the sides of the unitarity triangle , as expressed in eq .",
    "[ eqn : utrev ] .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath34 require determining the initial flavor of the @xmath6  meson , that is , whether the @xmath6  meson contained a @xmath2  quark or a @xmath38  antiquark .",
    "flavor determination is also crucial in the measurement of @xmath19  violation in the decays of neutral @xmath6  mesons to @xmath19  eigenstates .",
    "this paper describes a measurement of @xmath0 using data collected by the cdf experiment from @xmath39 collisions with a center - of - mass energy of 1.8  tev produced by the fermilab tevatron .",
    "in addition , the measurement of @xmath0 is used to demonstrate the performance of two methods ( described below ) of identifying the flavor of b  hadrons in the environment of @xmath39 collisions .",
    "these methods of flavor identification will be important in the measurement of  violation in the decays of neutral @xmath6  mesons and in the study of @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration has exploited the large @xmath2  quark cross - section at the fermilab tevatron to make several precision measurements of the properties of @xmath6  hadrons , including lifetimes and masses  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath2  quark production cross - section at the tevatron is large , the @xmath4 inelastic cross - section is three orders of magnitude larger , so specialized triggers are required to collect large samples of b  hadrons . to date , the triggers that have been utilized are based on leptons ( electrons and muons ) or dileptons .",
    "some analyses use the semileptonic decays of @xmath6  hadrons , @xmath40 ; some use the semileptonic decays of charmed particles from @xmath6  hadron decay ( _ e.g. _  @xmath41 , followed by @xmath42 ) ; and some use leptonic @xmath43 decays ( @xmath44 , followed by @xmath45 ) .",
    "previous measurements of @xmath0 from cdf were based on data samples collected with a dimuon trigger  @xcite and single - lepton triggers ( @xmath46 )  @xcite .",
    "the single - lepton triggers were used to partially reconstruct approximately 6,000 @xmath1  mesons via their semileptonic decays @xmath47 ( in this paper , reference to a particular decay sequence implies the charge - conjugate sequence as well ) .",
    "the analysis reported in this paper uses the same data sample collected with this trigger , but increases the number of @xmath6 mesons by over an order of magnitude by inclusively reconstructing @xmath6  hadrons that decay semileptonically .",
    "the inclusive reconstruction is made possible by the relatively long lifetime of @xmath6  hadrons : the decay point of the @xmath6  hadron is typically separated from the production point ( the primary vertex ) by a couple of millimeters .",
    "the inclusive reconstruction is based on identifying this decay point by associating the trigger lepton with other charged decay products to reconstruct a secondary vertex .",
    "the oscillation frequency @xmath0 can be found from either a time independent measurement ( that is , from the total number of @xmath1 s that decay as @xmath32 s ) or from a time dependent measurement ( that is , from the rates that a state that is pure @xmath48 at @xmath49 decays as either a @xmath50 or @xmath48 as a function of proper decay time @xmath51 ) .",
    "the latter technique has better sensitivity and allows a simultaneous study of the tagging methods since the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the effectiveness of the tagging method .",
    "the expected rate is @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mean lifetime of the two mass eigenstates of the @xmath1 ( the difference in lifetime of these two eigenstates is very small  @xcite and has been neglected ) , and @xmath51 is the proper decay time of the @xmath1 in its restframe . to measure this rate ,",
    "we need to make three measurements : ( 1 ) the proper decay time , ( 2 ) the @xmath6 flavor at decay , and ( 3 ) the produced @xmath6  flavor .",
    "we determine the proper time by measuring the distance from the production point to the decay point in the laboratory frame combined with an estimate of the @xmath48 momentum .",
    "the flavor at decay is determined from the charge of the lepton , assuming it comes from semileptonic @xmath6 decay . in our measurement",
    "@xcite of @xmath0 using @xmath47 decays , the flavor at production was identified using a same - side tagging technique based on the electric charge of particles produced in association with the @xmath48 .",
    "this flavor tag has also been applied  @xcite to a sample of @xmath55 decays to measure the cp  asymmetry . to identify the flavor at production in this analysis ,",
    "we rely on the fact that the dominant production mechanisms of @xmath2  quarks in @xmath39 collisions produce @xmath56  pairs . the flavors of the @xmath6  hadrons are assumed to be opposite at the time of production . in this paper , we identify the flavor of the other @xmath6  hadron using two techniques : the soft - lepton flavor tag ( slt ) and the jet - charge flavor tag ( jct ) .",
    "several precise measurements of @xmath0 have been published  @xcite by experiments operating on the @xmath57 and @xmath58  resonances .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 presented here is competitive in precision and in addition quantifies the performance of the flavor tags , which are crucial for future measurements of @xmath59  violation in the decays of @xmath6  mesons and the measurement of @xmath60 at a hadron collider .",
    "the jet - charge flavor tag is a powerful technique in studies of neutral @xmath6  meson flavor oscillations by experiments operating on the @xmath58  resonance  @xcite .",
    "this analysis is the first application of the jet - charge flavor tag in the environment of a hadron collider .",
    "the data sample used in this analysis was collected from 90  @xmath3 of @xmath39 collisions recorded with the cdf detector at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the cdf detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we summarize here the features of the detector that are important for this analysis .",
    "the cdf coordinate system has the @xmath61  axis pointing along the proton momentum , with the @xmath62  axis located in the horizontal plane of the tevatron storage ring , pointing radially outward , so that the @xmath63  axis points up .",
    "the coordinates @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the standard cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the cdf spectrometer consists of three separate detectors for tracking charged particles : the silicon vertex detector ( svx ) , the vertex detector ( vtx ) , and the central tracking chamber ( ctc ) , which are immersed in a magnetic field of 1.4  tesla pointed along the @xmath67  axis .",
    "the svx  @xcite consists of four concentric cylinders of single - sided silicon strip detectors positioned at radii between 3  cm and 8  cm from the beam line .",
    "the strips are oriented parallel to the beam axis and have a pitch of 60  @xmath68 m in the inner three layers and 55  @xmath68 m on the outermost layer .",
    "the svx is surrounded by the vtx , which is used to determine the @xmath61 coordinate of the @xmath39 interaction ( the primary vertex ) . surrounding the svx and",
    "vtx is the ctc .",
    "the ctc is a drift chamber that is 3.2  m long with 84 layers of sense wires located between a radius of 31  cm and 133  cm .",
    "the sense wires are organized into five axial superlayers and four stereo superlayers with a stereo angle of @xmath69 .",
    "the momentum resolution of the spectrometer is @xmath70^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , where @xmath71 is the component of momentum transverse to the @xmath61  axis ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "charged particle trajectories reconstructed in the ctc that are matched to strip - clusters in the svx have an impact parameter resolution of @xmath73 \\",
    "\\mu$]m , where the impact parameter @xmath74 is the distance of closest approach of the trajectory to the beam axis in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "the outer 54 layers of the ctc are instrumented to record the ionization ( @xmath75 ) of charged tracks .    surrounding the ctc are the central electromagnetic calorimeter ( cem ) and the central hadronic calorimeter ( cha ) .",
    "the cem has strip chambers ( ces ) positioned at shower maximum , and a preshower detector ( cpr ) located at a depth of one radiation length .",
    "beyond the central calorimeters lie two sets of muon detectors . to reach these two detectors , particles produced at the primary vertex with a polar angle of @xmath76",
    "must traverse material totaling 5.4 and 8.4 pion interaction lengths , respectively .",
    "the trigger system consists of three levels : the first two levels are implemented in hardware .",
    "the third level consists of software reconstruction algorithms that reconstruct the data , including three - dimensional track reconstruction in the ctc using a fast algorithm that is efficient only for @xmath77  .",
    "the sample selection begins with data from the inclusive @xmath78 and @xmath68 triggers . at level  2 ,",
    "both of these triggers require a track with @xmath79  found by the central fast tracker ( cft )  @xcite , a hardware track processor that uses fast timing information from the ctc as input .",
    "the resolution of the cft is @xmath80 . in the case of the electron trigger",
    ", the cft track must be matched to a cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter , with transverse energy @xmath81  gev , where @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the energy of the calorimeter cluster . in the case of the muon trigger",
    ", the cft track must be matched to a reconstructed track - segment in both sets of muon detectors . in the third level of the trigger , more stringent electron and muon selection criteria , which are similar to the selection criteria described in section  [ sec : lepton_id ] , are applied .",
    "the inclusive electron data set contains approximately 5.6  million events and the inclusive muon data set contains approximately 2.0  million events .",
    "these data are dominated by leptons from the decay of heavy flavors ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) and hadrons that mimic the lepton signal .",
    "electron candidates are identified using information from both the calorimeters and the tracking detectors .",
    "the electron calorimeter cluster in the cem must have @xmath86  gev .",
    "the longitudinal shower profile of this cluster is required to be consistent with an electron shower with a leakage energy from the cem into the cha of less than 4% .",
    "the lateral shower profile of the cem cluster has to be consistent with the profile determined from test beam electrons .",
    "a track with @xmath87  gev/@xmath88 must match the electron calorimeter cluster .",
    "this match is based on a comparison of the track position with the calorimeter cluster position determined in the ces : the difference between the extrapolated position of the track and the position of the cluster centroid must satisfy @xmath89  cm and @xmath90  cm .    to identify muons , we require a match between the extrapolated ctc track and the track segment in the muon chamber in both the @xmath64-@xmath91 and @xmath64-@xmath61 view . the uncertainty in this match is taken into account and is dominated by multiple scattering in the detector material .",
    "the transverse muon momentum must satisfy @xmath92  gev/@xmath88 .    finally , to ensure optimal resolution of the @xmath6  hadron decay point , the electron and muon candidate tracks have to be reconstructed in the svx detector .",
    "further analysis of the data sample is based on the charged particle jets in the event .",
    "charged particles ( instead of the more commonly used calorimeter clusters ) are used to form jets in order to keep the electron and muon samples as similar as possible .",
    "these jets are found using a cone clustering algorithm .",
    "tracks with @xmath93  are used as jet seeds .",
    "if two seeds are within @xmath94  @xcite , the momenta of the seeds are added together to form a new seed .",
    "after all possible seed merging , lower momentum tracks ( @xmath95  ) that are within @xmath96 of a seed are added in to form the final jets .",
    "the trigger lepton is always associated to a jet , and below we refer to this jet as the trigger - lepton jet .",
    "a jet can consist of a single track with @xmath97  .      in order to reconstruct the time of decay in the @xmath6 rest frame ( the proper time )",
    ", we must measure the point of decay with respect to the primary interaction in the lab and estimate the momentum of the @xmath6 .",
    "since the svx provides only coordinates in the plane transverse to the beam axis , the measurement of the separation between the point of decay and the primary vertex is done only in the @xmath62-@xmath63 plane .",
    "we refer to this separation as the decay length @xmath98 .",
    "only the component of the @xmath6 momentum transverse to the beam axis ( @xmath99 ) is needed to calculate the proper time at decay , since the decay length is measured in the @xmath62-@xmath63 plane .",
    "the positions of the @xmath4 interactions or `` primary vertices '' are distributed along the beam direction according to a gaussian with a width of @xmath100  cm . in the plane transverse to the beam axis , these interactions follow a distribution that is a gaussian with a width of @xmath101 m in both the @xmath62 and @xmath63 dimensions . to reconstruct the primary event vertex ,",
    "we first identify its @xmath61-position using the tracks reconstructed in the vtx detector . when projected back to the beam axis , these tracks determine the longitudinal location of the primary interaction with a precision of about 0.2  cm along the beam direction .",
    "if there is more than one reconstructed primary vertex in an event , the trigger lepton is associated with the primary vertex closest in @xmath61 to the intercept of the trigger lepton with the beam line .",
    "the transverse position of the primary vertex is determined for each event by a weighted fit of all tracks with a @xmath61 coordinate within 5  cm of the @xmath61-vertex position of the primary vertex associated with the trigger lepton .",
    "the tracks used in this fit are required to have been reconstructed in the svx detector .",
    "first all tracks are forced to originate from a common vertex .",
    "the position of this vertex is constrained by the transverse beam envelope described above .",
    "tracks that have large impact parameters with respect to this vertex are removed , and the fit is repeated .",
    "this procedure is iterated until all tracks are within the required impact parameter requirement .",
    "at least five tracks must be used in the determination of the transverse position of the primary vertex or we use the nominal beam - line position .",
    "the primary vertex coordinates transverse to the beam direction have an uncertainty in the range 10 - 35  @xmath68 m , depending on the number of tracks and the event topology .",
    "the reconstruction of the @xmath6 decay point ( referred to below as the secondary vertex ) in the trigger - lepton jet is based on the technique developed to identify jets formed by @xmath2  quarks coming from @xmath51  quark decay  @xcite . some modifications to this technique",
    "were necessary to maintain good efficiency for reconstructing the @xmath6  hadron decay point in our data sample , since the @xmath6  hadrons in this sample have substantially lower @xmath71 than the @xmath6  hadrons from top  quark decay .",
    "the search for a secondary vertex in the trigger - lepton jet is a two stage process . in both stages ,",
    "tracks in the jet are selected for reconstruction of a secondary vertex based on the significance of their impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the estimate of the uncertainty on @xmath104 .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath103 includes contributions from both the primary vertex and the track parameters .",
    "the first stage requires at least three candidate tracks for the reconstruction of the secondary vertex . the trigger lepton is always included as a candidate , whether or not it satisfies the @xmath102 requirement .",
    "tracks consistent with coming from the decay @xmath105 or @xmath106 are not used as candidate tracks .",
    "two candidate tracks are constrained to pass through the same space point to form a seed vertex .",
    "if at least one additional candidate track is consistent with intersecting this seed vertex , then the seed vertex is used as the secondary vertex .",
    "if the first stage is not successful in finding a secondary vertex , the second stage is attempted .",
    "more stringent track requirements ( on @xmath102 and @xmath71 , for example ) are imposed on the candidate tracks .",
    "all candidate tracks satisfying these stricter criteria are constrained to pass through the same space point to form a seed vertex .",
    "this vertex has an associated @xmath107 .",
    "candidate tracks that contribute too much to the @xmath107 are removed , and a new seed vertex is formed .",
    "this procedure is iterated until a seed vertex remains that has at least two associated tracks and an acceptable value of @xmath107 .",
    "the trigger lepton is one of the tracks used to determine the trigger - lepton jet secondary vertex in 96% of the events .",
    "the decay length of the secondary vertex @xmath98 is the projection of the two - dimensional vector pointing from the primary vertex to the secondary vertex on the jet axis ( defined by the sum of all the momenta of the tracks included in the jet ) ; if the cosine of the angle between these two vectors is positive ( negative ) , then @xmath98 is positive ( negative ) .",
    "secondary vertices from the decay of @xmath6  hadrons are expected to have positive @xmath98 , while negative @xmath98 vertices usually result from random combinations of mismeasured tracks . to reduce the background from these false vertices , we require @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the estimated uncertainty on @xmath98 .",
    "we require a secondary vertex to be associated with the trigger - lepton jet .",
    "this requirement leaves us with 243,800 events : 114,665 from the electron data sample and 129,135 from the muon data sample .",
    "the fraction of events with @xmath110 is 4.5% in the electron data sample and 5.7% in the muon - trigger sample . for reasons we discuss later",
    ", only events with @xmath111 are used in the determination of @xmath112 and the study of the performance of the flavor tags .",
    "the distribution of the number of jets with total transverse momentum @xmath113",
    "gev/@xmath88 is shown in the upper plot of figure  [ fig : jets ] .",
    "approximately 60% of the events contain a second jet in addition to the trigger - lepton jet .",
    "the lower plot in figure  [ fig : jets ] shows the difference in azimuth between the trigger - lepton jet and the jet with the highest @xmath71 in these events .",
    "a large fraction of these jets are back - to - back with the trigger - lepton jet as expected from the lowest - order processes that produce @xmath114 pairs .",
    "we search for secondary vertices in the other jets in the events as well .",
    "if an additional secondary vertex is found in one of these other jets , we classify this event as a `` double - vertex '' event .",
    "if only the single secondary vertex associated with the trigger - lepton jet is found , this event is classified as a `` single - vertex '' event .",
    "the distinction between single - vertex and double - vertex events is important in applying the jet - charge flavor tag as described below .",
    "the next step in the analysis is to identify the flavor at production of the @xmath6  hadron that produced the trigger lepton .",
    "we accomplish this by identifying the flavor of the other @xmath6  hadron produced in the collision .",
    "we refer to this other @xmath6  hadron as the `` opposite  @xmath6 '' in the text below .",
    "we first search for an additional lepton coming from the semileptonic decay of this opposite  @xmath6 . because the @xmath71 of this lepton is not biased by the trigger ,",
    "it is typically much smaller than the @xmath71 of the trigger lepton , so we call this method of flavor identification the `` soft - lepton tag '' or slt",
    ". the soft lepton can be either an electron or a muon .",
    "the lepton selection criteria are similar to the selection criteria described in section  [ sec : lepton_id ] and reference  @xcite , with additional selection criteria that use @xmath75 , and pulse height in the cpr and ces .",
    "the soft lepton must have a track with @xmath115  gev/@xmath88 , and the invariant mass of the soft lepton and the trigger lepton must be greater than 5  gev/@xmath116 .",
    "this requirement removes soft leptons coming from sequential semileptonic decays of charm particles produced in the decay of the @xmath6  hadron producing the trigger lepton .",
    "the lepton identification criteria restrict the acceptance of the soft leptons to a pseudorapidity of @xmath117 , where .",
    "approximately 5.2% of the 243,800 events contain a soft lepton candidate .",
    "if a soft lepton is not found , we try to identify the jet produced by the opposite  @xmath6 .",

    "the sign of the jet charge is on average the same as the sign of the @xmath2-quark that produced the jet , so the sign of the jet charge may be used to identify the flavor at production of the @xmath6  hadron producing the trigger lepton .",
    "if a second jet in the event other than the trigger - lepton jet has a secondary vertex , then we use this jet to calculate the jet charge .",
    "double - vertex events with a jet - charge flavor tag are referred to as jcdv events .",
    "if only the trigger - lepton jet contains a secondary vertex , we search for a jet with @xmath124 with respect to the trigger lepton and @xmath113  . if there is more than one jet satisfying the above criteria , we choose the jet with the highest @xmath71 .",

    "the secondary vertex in the trigger - lepton jet may be a true vertex due to the decay of heavy flavor ( @xmath2 or @xmath88 ) or a random combination of erroneously reconstructed tracks that appear to form a vertex that is displaced from the primary interaction ( a fake vertex ) .",
    "light quark or gluon jets produce false vertices with @xmath111 with equal probability as false vertices with @xmath110 . the small fraction ( @xmath1266% ) of events with @xmath110 indicates that this background is small . in the analysis",
