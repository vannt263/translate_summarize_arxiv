    "the characteristic time of this correlation function corresponds to the time needed for the system to lose memory of the initial configuration of the velocities .",
    "some progress has been made recently by investigating the collision statistics : visco _ et .",
    "al_@xcite showed that the free flight time distribution is not exponential , even in the low - density limit ( such a behavior was observed in molecular simulation of hard spheres some years ago@xcite ) .",
    "deviations from the poisson law of the number of collisions can be captured in the framework of the boltzmann equation and agree with molecular simulation results .",
    "we introduce here a new quantity by focusing on collision events irrespective of the time when individual collisions occur .",
    "we consider the scalar product between the velocity before a given collision and the velocity after @xmath0 collisions .",
    "( note that this quantity is distinct from the distribution of velocity for a hard sphere on collision , which characterizes the distribution of the relative velocity of colliding spheres , for which lue@xcite obtained exact results in three , four and five dimensions ) .",
    "the information obtained is not only the average of the scalar product , but the full distribution of the scalar product between the velocity before and after a sequence of @xmath0 collisions .",
    "when @xmath3 , this corresponds to the probability of the scalar product between the pre- and post - collisional velocities during a collision ; it is worth noting that the first moment of the distribution does not correspond to the velocity correlation function at the mean collision time : indeed , the probability distribution is built for collisions occurring at different collision times , whereas the velocity correlation function corresponds to the velocities scalar product at a given time .    as the number of collisions increases , the correlations between velocities decrease and the distribution evolves progressively to the asymptotic form where the velocities are uncorrelated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we obtain the probability distributions in the limit of an infinite number of collisions , i.e. when the velocities are completely uncorrelated , in any spatial dimension . in section iii , we derive the first - collision velocity distribution in any dimension . section iv is devoted to the corrections induced by the non - gaussian behavior of granular systems , and we compare the analytical results to dsmc results .",
    "velocity - correlation distributions at the second and higher collisions are analyzed in section v.    let us define , right away , the central quantity of this study , the velocity - correlation distribution @xmath4 at the @xmath0th collision : @xmath5 where the brackets denote a statistical average in a given steady state , @xmath6 denotes the precollisional velocity of a tagged particle before the first collision and @xmath7 the postcollisional velocity of the same particle after the @xmath0th collision .",
    "we only consider the case of homogeneous systems .",
    "we first consider the situation where the number of collisions is very large , i.e. the velocity before the first collision and the velocity after a large number of collisions become uncorrelated .",

    "@xmath17 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , which gives @xmath18 it is worth noting that @xmath19 is the mellin convolution of the two velocity distributions as this distribution is that of the product of two independent random variables . when the velocity distribution @xmath20 is gaussian @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mass and the temperature of the tagged particle , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 can be explicitly obtained and is then equal to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the modified bessel function of second kind .",
    "the basic property of @xmath19 is that the distribution is symmetric because the velocities are uncorrelated .",
    "the behavior of @xmath19 is intriguing at small values of @xmath26 , as one observes a logarithmic divergence at @xmath27 .",

    ", @xmath19 decays as @xmath28 for large values of @xmath26 , i.e. less rapidly than the original velocity distribution which has a gaussian decay .    in two and more dimensions ,",
    "the velocity - correlation distribution can be obtained by noting that the fourier transform of eq.([eq:5 ] ) ( or integrating eq.([eq:3 ] ) ) , leads to @xmath29    by inserting eq.([eq:6 ] ) in eq.([eq:4 ] ) , the generating function @xmath30 in @xmath14 dimensions is then @xmath31 the inverse fourier transform can be calculated in any dimension : in 2d , the fourier transform has a lorentz profile , which gives in real space @xmath32 and in three dimensions , @xmath33 in 2d and in 3d , the probability distribution is no longer singular at the origin .",

    "in order to have tractable expressions for the first - collision velocity - correlation distribution @xmath38 , we assume that the the `` molecular chaos '' is valid , i.e. that there are no correlations between the particles before collision . the joint velocity distribution of the tagged particle and the bath particles is simply the product of the individual velocity distributions .",
    "moreover , it is necessary to account for the rate of collisions which depends on the relative velocity at the point of impact as well as all possibilities of collision by summing up on the locations of the impact on the sphere .",
    "@xmath38 is then given by @xmath39 where @xmath20 and @xmath40 are , respectively , the velocity distributions of the tagged and bath particles .",
    "the integral with the subscript @xmath41 corresponds to the integration over the unit sphere with the restriction @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a unit vector along the axis joining the two centers of particles ( this imposes that the particles are approaching each other before colliding ) .",

    "this discontinuity is clearly apparent in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "the first - collision velocity - correlation distribution can also be obtained analytically in two dimensions and above .",
    "indeed the calculation can be performed following a method used in the one - dimensional case .",
    "let us note that the scalar product of the pre- and post - collisional velocities @xmath96 can be expressed in an orthonormal basis associated with the collision as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 denote the normal and tangential components of the velocity .",
    "the post - collisional quantities in the rhs of eq.([eq:24 ] ) can be eliminated by using eq.([eq:8 ] ) : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the normal component of the velocity of the bath particle .    since the normal and tangent components of the tracer particle are independent random variables , the integrals can be performed successively over @xmath101 and @xmath98 as in the one - dimensional case , provided that @xmath26 is shifted to @xmath102 .",

    "as already noted , @xmath118 has the same @xmath26 dependence as in 1d and 2d when @xmath57 .",
    "the influence of the dimension is in the amplitude factor which decreases when the dimension increases , the temperature and other microscopic parameters ( masses , coefficient of restitution ) being kept constant .    from eq.([eq:25 ] ) , the fraction of events with a negative velocities scalar product can be exactly obtained ; moreover , a general formula can be obtained in any dimension :    @xmath125",
    "for granular gases , whose kinetic properties are well described by the boltzmann equation , the velocity distribution is no longer a gaussian .",
    "the deviations from gaussian behavior can be captured by sonine corrections .",

    "is involved , we will only provide that obtained for @xmath57 , which is    @xmath130    where the @xmath131 s are simple functions of @xmath13 given in appendix b.    since the 2d case is closer to possible experimental systems , we have also included sonine corrections to the velocity distribution for calculating the velocity - correlation distribution @xmath103 , but the lengthy expressions are not given here .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] displays the analytical result ( @xmath103 with sonine corrections ) and the dsmc results for two values of the coefficient of restitution : @xmath132 . even for the more inelastic case ,",
    "the agreement between analytical results and dsmc is remarkable .",
    "the collision statistics can be followed beyond the first - collision distribution .",
    "formally , the second - collision velocity - correlation distribution @xmath133 is given by the relation @xmath134    where @xmath135 denotes the pre - collisional velocity of the tagged particle for the first collision ,",
