    "pairing correlations are an important feature of nuclear structure @xcite . in heavy nuclei such correlations between neutrons and protons are usually neglected on the grounds that the two fermi levels are far apart . in nuclei with @xmath5",
    ", however , the fermi levels are close and neutron - proton ( @xmath6 ) pairing correlations can be expected to play a significant role in nuclear structure and decay ( for a review of work on @xmath6 pairing theory see ref .",
    "the importance of these proton - rich nuclei in astrophysical nucleosynthesis makes it vital that the @xmath6 correlations are well understood , and upcoming experiments with radioactive beams will soon test our understanding .",
    "taking @xmath6 correlations seriously complicates the usual treatment of pairing , which stresses the interaction of like particles in time - reversed orbits , i.e.  the formation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 pairs . generalizing this picture raises at least two new issues",
    "first , the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 isovector pairs must all be treated on an equal footing so that isospin symmetry is respected as much as possible@xcite .",
    "second , the competition between two kinds of @xmath6 pairing  isovector and isoscalar ( @xmath4 and @xmath3 )  must be taken into account .",
    "this issue apparently arises even in nuclei with @xmath9 where @xmath6 pairing is by most measures small .",
    "for example , the rate of two - neutrino double - beta decay within the @xmath6 quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) is extremely sensitive to the strength of isoscalar particle - particle ( i.e.  pairing ) correlations , making reliable calculations difficult . when these correlations become strong enough the method fails even to give finite answers .    the breakdown in the qrpa signals an impending phase transition .",
    "is it real or an artifact of the assumption underlying the approximation that the ground state contains no @xmath6 correlations ?",
    "what are the properties of the  isoscalar phase \" , if it is real ?",
    "is the renormalized qrpa ( rqrpa)@xcite , in which solutions are more stable , a good way to handle the breakdown / phase transition ? is generalized bcs theory , a scheme for treating @xmath6 pairing on a more equal footing with @xmath8 and @xmath7 pairing , able to quantify the interplay between the two phases ?",
    "we address these questions here in a solvable model that incorporates both isovector and isoscalar pairing , making it considerably richer than the more schematic models ( e.g.  the lipkin model@xcite ) typically used for this kind of study .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the model and its analytic solution for energies and gamow - teller beta - decay matrix elements , stressing the existence of two limiting solutions corresponding to pure isovector or isoscalar pairing .",
    "we show that in the isoscalar phase , charge - changing processes have counterintuitive features .",
    "section 3 contains an outline of the qrpa and rqrpa as realized in the solvable model , and applies them to single and double beta - decay to test the quality of the approximations . in section 4",
    "we describe generalized bcs theory for @xmath0 , again with emphasisis on beta decay strengths ( though we also examine ground - state energies ) , and again test the reliability of the approximation scheme .",

    "the reason is that any excess neutrons are necessarily in isovector pairs , making the transition to isoscalar pairing more difficult for the remaining nucleons .",
    "we turn our attention now to transitions induced by the gt operators @xmath50 .",

    "the @xmath59-decay operators break one pair ( of either kind ) , leading to matrix elements between simple @xmath28 representations , the properties of which were studied in ref .",

    "we find @xmath60 this result applies in a single @xmath61-shell with degeneracy @xmath62 as well as in the model discussed here , which necessarily contains at least 2 degenerate levels in the @xmath63 scheme ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 strength is plotted as a function of @xmath30 for @xmath65 , @xmath66 in fig .",
    "except for the initial plateau at low @xmath30 the behavior of the curve is qualitatively similar to that obtained in bcs theory , where the neutron - proton interaction is ignored .",
    "the gradual decrease in strength with @xmath30 is caused by pauli blocking .    in the isoscalar phase",
    "the result is @xmath67 here the behavior of the strength as @xmath30 increases from 0 is surprisingly different ( see fig .",
    "the substantial rise at first seems counterintuitive since the neutron excess is increasing .",
    "blocking is not the only factor at work , however . for lower @xmath30 the effect",
    "is overcome by the collective behavior of the boson - like @xmath34 pairs in the final state .    in fig .",
    "4 we examine the behavior of the strength @xmath57 between the two limits , as a function of @xmath48 for fixed @xmath27 ( when @xmath68 all curves become flatter , because the system is closer to the @xmath19 limit . ) as @xmath48 increases , the strength @xmath57 decreases , vanishing when the @xmath19 limit is reached and increasing again as the isoscalar pairing phase is approached until finally it is considerably larger than in the isovector phase .",
    "the large strength is caused in part by the transfer of protons from @xmath7 pairs , which can not participate in @xmath1 decay , to isoscalar @xmath6 pairs , which can . only close to @xmath33",
    ", however are this effect and the parabolic isospin dependence fully present ; when @xmath48 is small the strength can be small as well and the isospin dependence complicated , as is apparent from the crossings of curves in fig .",
    "4 . a large @xmath1 strength ( compared ,",
    "e.g. , to the ikeda sum rule ) therefore reflects very strong isoscalar pairing .",
    "if real , it would have important consequences for r - p process nucleosynthesis .",
    "we have stressed @xmath1 strength because of its simplicity and sensitivity to details of nuclear structure .",
    "now , however , we want to discuss modifications of the qrpa , the most frequent and controversial application of which is to double - beta decay . actually , in a model with as few states as this one , the @xmath1 strength from the  final \" nucleus ( @xmath69 ) essentially determines the double - beta decay matrix element ( considered here in the closure approximation for simplicity and because the energy denominator can change without a concommitant change in the wave functions ) .",
    "the reason is that the matrix element has the form @xmath70 and for a moderate neutron excess the @xmath55 strength , the other relevant quantity , hardly varies with @xmath46 . in realistic calculations ,",
    "the qrpa , which has many desirable features , suffers an unfortunate instability when @xmath71 becomes too large that manifests itself through infinite values for both the @xmath1 strength and the double - beta - decay rate .",
    "a number of remedies have been proposed recently .",
    "one that has received particular attention is the renormalized qrpa ( rqrpa)@xcite , which eliminates the instability of the qrpa through a self - consistent calculation of the ground state .",
    "the model presented here is ideal for examining how both qrpa and the new approximation work .",
    "the p - n qrpa , described , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied to @xmath0 in the same paper , begins with the ordinary bcs ansatz , a coherent state of isovector neutron - neutron and proton - proton pairs , and proceeds by admixing neutron - proton quasiparticle pairs into the ground and excited states . in @xmath0",
    "the procedure leads to 2 by 2 matrix equations in each of the two ( fermi / isovector pairing and gamow - teller / isoscalar pairing ) channels and can be solved by simple diagonalization .",
    "more specificially , the one excited state in each channel ( @xmath14 or @xmath17 ) is written in the form @xmath72^{l=0,s } \\right ) |\\tilde{0 } > ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) create ( destroy ) proton and neutron quasiparticles , the brackets indicate angular momentum coupling , @xmath77 is the qrpa ground state and @xmath78,@xmath79 , and ( @xmath80,@xmath81 ) are the ",
    "physical \" eigenvectors in the spin-0 , isospin-1 ( fermi ) and spin-1 isospin-0 ( gamow - teller ) channels ( additional details are in ref .",
    "the two channels decouple and for two - neutrino double beta decay only the second is relevant . associated with the @xmath17 eigenvector is an eigenvalue that becomes complex when @xmath82 reaches a critical value connected with the impending phase transition .",
    "the states with complex eigenvalues are not normalizable and have no physical significance , so that the approximation fails to give even an incorrect answer beyond the critical point .",
    "this is the  collapse \" referred to above and is preceded by rapid changes in the @xmath1 and double - beta - decay amplitudes .    in the rqrpa ,",
    "described for charge - changing modes in ref.@xcite , the two channels are coupled in an attempt to make the vacuum self consistent , and the resulting equations are nonlinear . for the @xmath0 model the equations",
    "have seven variables : the two sets of @xmath83 s and @xmath84 s , the eigenvalue associated with each set , and a renormalization parameter .",
    "the iterative procedure advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite often does not converge here , but the model s simplicity makes the equations easy to solve by other means . unlike the qrpa , the rqrpa never exhibits the analog of the complex eigenvalues that signal instability , and therefore never yields rapidly changing matrix elements .",
    "the question is whether any important physics is lost in the process of guaranteeing a ground state that is built on the bcs state .",
    "5 presents the exact @xmath55 and @xmath1 strengths for fixed @xmath85 and @xmath86 and several values of @xmath30 , along with the qrpa and rqrpa approximations to the strengths . the qrpa breakdown is reflected in the expression for the @xmath1 strength , which blows up at the critical value of @xmath46 ( or @xmath82 ) .",
    "by contrast the rqrpa strength is perfectly stable .",
    "the graphs make it clear , however , that the stability is achieved at a significant price ; the very real phase transition to a ground state dominated by isoscalar pairing correlations changes the behavior of @xmath57 , causing the qrpa to break down , but refuses to show itself at all in the rqrpa approximation .",
    "the reason is that in preserving ( self - consistently ) the basic qrpa ansatz the rqrpa limits the isoscalar correlations in the ground state . put another way , the qrpa breaks down for a reason ; there really is a phase transition and it really is nearby , and the rqrpa erases all traces of it .",
    "thus at the very point at which the qrpa fails the rqrpa also begins to deviate badly from the exact result . to make matters worse , and this has been noted elsewhere@xcite , renormalization destroys one of the nicest features of the qrpa , the preservation of the ikeda sum rule eq .",
    "( 4 ) . in this model , at least",
    ", nothing is gained by using the rqrpa .    to demonstrate this explicitly for double beta decay , we show in fig .",
    "6 the matrix element @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 as a function of @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "we use this parameter rather than @xmath46 because it more closely resembles that used in realistic calculations .",
    "we have set @xmath92 so that the qrpa breaks down just beyond the point at which the matrix element crosses the origin ( when @xmath93 i.e.  at the @xmath19 point ) .",
    "this is the situation in more realistic calculations as well , but our model shows it to be pure coincidence ; the breakdown of the qrpa moves to larger @xmath82 as the essentially independent parameter @xmath47 is increased , while the crossing point never moves , implying that nothing fundamental is behind the proximity of the crossing to the point at which the qrpa fails in realistic calculations .",
    "interestingly , the exact matrix element in our model varies smoothly as the phase transition is traversed , in sharp contrast to the rapid drop in the prediction of the qrpa , which as noted blows up completely just past the crossing point .",
    "the rqrpa , as in the last figure , begins to fail at the same point and offers little advantage over the qrpa itself .    in more realistic calculations",
    "this last conclusion may or may not hold .",
    "the simple model examined here contains only two very collective degrees of freedom .",
    "it is certainly possible that with less collectivity the qrpa approximation is worse and the breakdown occurs far from the actual phase transition . in that event",
    "the rqrpa would offer advantages , especially in the region between the breakdown of the qrpa and the real phase transition",
    ". it would therefore be useful to examine the approximation in a model that dilutes the collectivity of the @xmath3 @xmath6 pairs but is still solvable .",
    "a two - level version of @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath94@xcite , might be a good place to start .",
    "here we can say only that we find no evidence supporting the validity of the rqrpa .",
    "in this section , we apply generalized pairing theory to the @xmath0 model , to assess its ability to provide a meaningful approximate description of the ground ",
    "state dynamics of the model in the various phases .",
    "we simplify the model slightly by setting @xmath47 to zero ( and @xmath95 to 2 , which merely scales the energies ) .",
    "generalized pairing theory is well reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite and thus will not be discussed in detail here .",
    "suffice it to say that the theory is founded in the hfb approximation , supplemented by the further assumption that the only nonzero matrix elements of the hartree fock and pair potentials are those connecting the four states @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes the state obtained by time - reversal on the state @xmath101 .",
    "as such , the theory naturally accomodates all pairing modes on an equal footing .",
    "this includes the usual @xmath102 and @xmath103 pairing as well as @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 pairing .",
    "note that here and in subsequent discussion we explicitly distinguish the pairing of particles in  the same orbit \" ( e.g. , @xmath6 ) from the pairing of particles in  time  reversed orbits \"",
    "( e.g. , @xmath105 ) .",
    "we have chosen to formulate the theory in terms of the density matrix @xmath107 and the pairing tensor @xmath108 .",

    "perhaps a more fruitful approach , therefore , will be a more self - consistent qrpa , in which the rpa and bcs equations are coupled .",
    "such a procedure can rescue the ikeda sum rule@xcite and could conceivably facilitate isoscalar - isovector mixing at the bcs level even to the left of the critical point .",

    "<S> we examine isovector and isoscalar neutron - proton correlations in an exactly solvable model based on the algebra @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we look particularly closely at gamow - teller strength and double beta decay , both to isolate the effects of the two kinds of pairing and to test two approximation schemes : the renormalized neutron - proton qrpa ( rqrpa ) and generalized bcs theory . </S>",
    "<S> when isoscalar pairing correlations become strong enough a phase transition occurs and the dependence of the gamow - teller @xmath1 strength on isospin changes in a dramatic and unfamiliar way , actually increasing as neutrons are added to an @xmath2 core . </S>",
    "<S> renormalization eliminates the well - known instabilities that plague the qrpa as the phase transition is approached , but only by unnaturally suppressing the isoscalar correlations . </S>",
    "<S> generalized bcs theory , on the other hand , reproduces the gamow - teller strength more accurately in the isoscalar phase than in the usual isovector phase , even though its predictions for energies are equally good everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> it also mixes @xmath3 and @xmath4 pairing , but only on the isoscalar side of the phase transition . </S>"
