    "the source of the recently detected gravitational waves ( gws ) by the ligo collaboration  @xcite has been interpreted to be the inspiral and merger of a pair of intermediate mass binary black holes .",
    "this interpretation has been viewed as secure since the observed waveform had an excellent fit to the very different physics of early and late inspiral .",
    "the early waveform fit the `` chirp '' pattern  @xcite of the evolving nearly circular binary orbit driven to smaller radii and higher angular velocity by the loss of energy to outgoing gravitational waves .",
    "the late waveform fit the pattern for the quasinormal ringdown ( qnr ) of the perturbed final black hole , a black hole of the appropriate angular momentum and mass as implied by the merger process  @xcite .",
    "the early pattern is not exclusive to orbiting black holes ; it would be no different for a binary of any compact objects of the same masses .",
    "what is most important for the black hole interpretation is the qnr , and the way in which the transition from the early waveform to the qnr agrees with the black hole models of numerical relativity  @xcite .    the importance of the qnr to the black hole interpretation has led to studies of the question of alternative , non - black hole , sources of qnr - like waveforms  @xcite",
    "one recent example is the double wormhole model of cardoso , franzen and pani  @xcite ( hereafter cfp ) .",
    "the fact that damped oscillations are not uniquely , or even especially , associated with black holes is not news  @xcite , but a relatively new element of the question is whether the replacement for the black hole may involve reflections and may produce echoes , i.e. , delayed repetitions of the qnr - like pattern  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a discovery has been claimed of just such echoes in the gravitational wave detector data  @xcite , though the statistical significance of the claim has been disputed by members of the ligo collaboration  @xcite .    in this paper , we do not focus exclusively on the ligo detections , but rather we consider somewhat broadly the physics that lies behind recent claims , the nature of reflections of gravitational waves and echoes that might result from such reflections from surfaces around compact objects .",
    "there is , however , a possible relevance to gravitational waveform interpretation : the issue of how closely echoes might be delayed repetitions of an earlier burst .",
    "do echoes , for instance , have the same frequency and damping rate of the late `` ringing '' in an initial burst ? might differences between the initial burst and its echo contain , at least in principle , interesting information ?",
    "we discuss , in sec .",
    "[ sec : nature ] , the general nature of echoes , and connect that issue to the meaning and features of quasinormal modes .",
    "we shall point out the important differences between two very different sources of echoes : on the one hand echoes can result from a feature of the `` curvature potential '' through which waves propagate  @xcite ; on the other hand echoes can be the result of some sort of `` wall '' surrounding a compact object .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : reflecs ] , we pay particular attention to the physical meaning of `` reflection , '' and point out a pitfall in the mathematical analysis of refection of radiation at a surface around a black hole .",
    "we conclude and summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .    throughout , the paper we use the conventions of the textbook by misner _",
    "et al . _",
    "in particular , we use the metric convention -+++ , and units in which @xmath0 . for simplicity",
    "we will , for the most part , use spherical symmetry in examples , so that , for instance , we will give details for schwarzschild , rather than the astrophysically more relevant rotating kerr holes . but",
    "issues of kerr holes will be important , and will constitute the motivation , especially in sec .  [ sec : reflecs ] .",
    "at the outset it is important to note that there can be at least two distinct sources of echoes .",
    "one source is the spacetime itself , and more specifically the curvature potential through which waves propagate .",
    "an example of this is the double light ring model of cardoso _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in that model ,",
    "two peaks in the curvature potential act , in effect , as two locations at which wave interactions can be viewed in terms of transmission and reflection .",
    "a second source of echoes is some sort of a `` wall '' that forms an inner boundary of the wave propagation problem , and that replaces the horizon as the boundary  @xcite .",
    "these walls are typically associated with speculations , or specific models , of quantum effects .",
    "it is crucial to emphasize here the difference between formal quasinormal ringing ( qnr ) and quasinormal - like oscillations ( qnr - like ) .",
    "the former refers to an eigenvalue problem for single frequency modes of a system , typically a system characterized by a fairly compact potential for wave propagation .",
    "the boundary conditions on the modes involve outgoing radiation , so that the eigenproblem is not self adjoint , and the frequency eigenvalues are complex . in the case of black holes ,",
    "the boundary conditions are outgoing radiation at infinity and ingoing radiation at the horizon .",
    "these complex eigenvalues also show up as poles in the frequency - domain green function for the system .",
    "typically , there is an infinite spectrum of such modes for any linear system , e.g. , for the differential equation for a particular multipole mode of a black hole perturbation field  @xcite .",
    "the qnr - like signals are damped oscillations . in the black hole context these qnr - like waveforms",
    "have long been associated with the late - time `` ringdown '' of perturbed black holes .",
    "while this association developed in work on black hole perturbation theory in the 1970s , this ringdown has been seen in all numerical relativity simulations of black hole ringdown , simulations based on the fully nonlinear equations of einstein s general relativity .",
    "such qnr - like waveforms typically have very nearly the period of oscillation and the exponential damping rate of the least damped of the quasinormal modes , and there was little attention given to the difference .",
    "in fact , a system with a time dependent source can not exhibit pure qnr  @xcite . the outgoing signal will always be affected by the time dependence of the source as well as the damped - sinusoid pattern of a qn mode . from the green s function point of view",
    ", the integral of the source over the green s function  @xcite will include a residue for the qn pole , but will have other contributions .",
    "it must be asked , then , why is there such a close apparent correspondence between the late time signal and the least damped qn mode ?",
    "part of the answer is that the correspondence is not always valid .",
    "nollert  @xcite studied the mathematical problem of evolving initial data in the schwarzschild spacetime and showed that a class of minor modifications of the problem had no discernible effect on the evolved data , but changed the qn spectrum enormously .",
    "more recently , cfp have shown that the qn spectrum of a wormhole consisting of two schwarzschild `` funnels '' is enormously different from that of the schwarzschild black hole , yet the initial qnr - like ringing of the wormhole is almost identical to that of the black hole .",
    "there are , therefore , examples in which there are weak or missing connections between the qn frequencies of a system and the qnr - like ringing exhibited in signals generated by sources .",
    "but there are examples in which there is a strong connection and black hole processes fall in that second class .",
    "it is important to ask why .",
    "cfp have ascribed the qn frequency and qnr - like ringing to the role of the light - ring . in the case of black holes",
    "this is an interesting heuristic insight and one that was first shown to give good estimates of qn frequencies by goebels  @xcite .",
    "it can not , however , be the complete story .",
    "one can , after all , trivially set up a 1 + 1 model ( one spatial dimension , one time dimension ) with outgoing radiation boundary conditions but with no attached concept of a light ring ; such a problem will have a qn spectrum and a qnr - like ringing .",
    "we have also presented a 3 + 1 model with no light ring , yet with qnr - like oscillations  @xcite .",
    "a more general view of the connection between qn and qnr - like mathematics is that the qnr - like signal is due to `` scattering '' within a potential .",
    "that scattering can account for the damping of the outgoing radiation . in a computation of the qn spectrum",
    "it is this scattering that can be viewed as lying at the heart of modes at a single frequency .",
    "the scattering viewpoint is very insensitive to distant boundary conditions and should be initiated as the source ( initial data or particle motion ) interacts with a peak of a potential .",
    "the scattering viewpoint suggests that a wkb approximation may give good estimates , but of the frequencies of the qnr - like oscillations , _ not _ of the true qn eigenvales .",
    "the wkb approximation uses an integral over the potential , so it is insensitive to the changes ( e.g. , those of nollert ) that greatly change the qn spectrum ; the approximation also is insensitive to distant boundary conditions .",
    "to some extent the wkb approximation and the scattering viewpoint are conceptually , or heuristically quite close .",
    "this can be taken as a partial explanation of the examples in which the qn frequencies do not agree with the scattering / wkb results .",
    "this disagreement is most pronounced when the curvature potential is not smoothly varying in space .",
    "the condition for success of the wkb approximation is that the spatial rate of change of the curvature potential is small  @xcite .",
    "the wkb approximation has given fairly good agreement with computed black hole qn frequencies , but it must be kept in mind that the wkb approximation is a high frequency approximation , and it is typically applied to wavelengths that are of order of the width of the potential that affects wave propagation .",
    "the situation then is that we can take some comfort in the wkb approximation giving results in good agreement with computed waveforms , but must not be surprised in the absence of such agreement .",
    "this scattering viewpoint lets us make some predictions about the nature of the qnr - like signals in echoes .",
    "these will be discussed below .",
    "the work by cfp has provided useful examples of echoes from a potential with two peaks .",
    "this is one of two distinct ways in which echoes can be generated .",
    "we will refer to that paper in arguments below , but here we shall focus on the other general manner in which echoes can be generated : a reflecting wall .",
    "our specific model will start with the equation @xmath1 for a schwarzschild black hole @xmath2 is a representation of a multipole of a scalar , electromagnetic or gravitational perturbation field ; the @xmath3 coordinate is the regge - wheeler  @xcite tortoise coordinate @xmath4 , and the source term can represtent a particle .",
    "the potential , in the black hole case is the curvature potential  @xcite , which falls off as @xmath5 as @xmath6 , and falls off exponentially as @xmath7 , the location of the horizon .    for our model we will start with the pschl - teller potential  @xcite",
    "@xmath8 the boundary condition will be the outgoing condition at @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath2 becomes proportional to @xmath10}$ ] as @xmath9 .",
    "for the other boundary condition , we may take @xmath11}$ ] as @xmath12 , which we will call the horizon condition , since it is the analog of the horizon boundary condition for black holes . but we may also take , as a model for reflection , a `` wall condition , '' the condition that @xmath13 at some particular value of @xmath3 , the location of a reflecting wall .    the solution of the system of eqs .",
    "( [ gende ] ) and ( [ eq : pt ] ) , with the outgoing condition , is proportional to the associated legendre function @xmath14 by expressing this in terms of a gauss hypergeometric function it can be shown that the horizon condition at @xmath12 is achieved only for @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the frequency of interest , the least damped qn mode , is that for @xmath17 .    in the case of the reflecting wall condition , @xmath13 at @xmath18",
    ", we must search numerically for the complex value of @xmath19 for which @xmath20 .",
    "this search was carried out by a simple code that performs a series of hierarchical searches over the complex plane looking for zeros of @xmath21 as needed . we begin with a coarsely refined grid , and identify regions of the plane that yield values of the mentioned function that are lower than a certain threshold .",
    "we then use these as the center points for more refined grids and resume the search .",
    "this process is continued several times ( the search threshold value is lowered with each refinement , of course ) .",
    "this allows us to hone in on the zeros of the function in fairly simple and accurate manner .",
    "a separate numerical exercise was to evolve @xmath2 , from initial data representing a narrow gaussian pulse , starting at @xmath22 ( large enough so that the potential is effectively zero ) and moving in the negative @xmath3 direction .",
    "this was done using a separate time - domain wave - equation solver that uses a time - explicit , 2-step lax wendroff , second - order finite - difference evolution scheme .",
    "our first example appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparo5vshor ] . the evolutions of an initial ingoing gaussian pulse",

    "condition at @xmath23 . ]",
    "because the reflecting wall is so close to the peak , this model does not involve echoes , but rather changes the problem to another with a modified single peak .",
    "this example serves to show a case in which the qnr - like ringing agrees quite well with the qn eigenvalue / pole .",
    "the pure pschl - teller potential has , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qnptomegas ] ) , a least damped qn @xmath19 of @xmath24 , which agrees to good accuracy with a fit to the dashed curve in the fig .",
    "[ fig : comparo5vshor ] for @xmath3 larger than around 80 .",
    "the eigenvalue search for the @xmath25 case gives a least damped value of 0.640 + i 0.0096 , which agrees with a fit to the curve to about 1% with the real part and to about 5% ( the fit uncertainty ) for the imaginary part .",
    "it will be of some interest , for later models , to check the applicability of the schutz - will wkb approximation  @xcite for the dominant ( i.e. , least damped ) qn frequency @xmath26 : @xmath27 this formula is to be applied at the peak of the potential , where the second derivative of the curvature potential is negative , and hence the second term on the right is pure imaginary . in the case of the pschl - teller  potential in eq .",
    "this gives @xmath28 .",
    "note that this result is a reasonable approximation of the pure pschl - teller  qn mode .",
    "the wkb prediction @xmath29 applies to the model with @xmath25 as well as to the pure pschl - teller  potential , since both models in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparo5vshor ] have the same peak behavior . here",
    "the wkb approximation is still in the right ballpark for the real part , but orders of magnitude wrong for the imaginary part .",
    "this should be expected .",
    "the schutz - will estimate approximates the effective curvature potential as a parabola near the peak and works best if the turning points , those locations at which @xmath30 , are close together .",
    "for the high qn frequencies in some models , this does not apply ; there are not even any turning points .",
    "it is not surprising that the real part in the schutz - will estimate eq .  , which does not depend delicately on the shape of the potential is widely applicable , though it is surprising how good an estimate it is .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the wkb method is local ; it may be considered to be related to the scattering picture of qnr - like phenomena .",
    "it may also be worth emphasizing that in our pschl - teller  model there is no meaning to a `` light ring . ''",

    "if we consider outgoing radiation to be generated at @xmath36 , and the first echo to be the reflection off the wall at @xmath31 , then the outgoing echo should follow the initial qnr - like burst by a time delay of 40 .",
    "for that reason , in fig .",

    ". however , such a naive attempt yields no echoes whatsoever ! in the next section , we explain this null result and also sketch out a potential scheme for attempting to implement a proper reflection condition in the context of gravitational waves .",
    "in this section we consider the description of reflections at some sort of `` wall . ''",
    "we shall not be , nor need to be specific about the nature of this reflecting wall , except for one requirement .",
    "the reflection must be the result of a local condition , and not a condition like the modification of the potential ( that is in a loose sense , global ) .",
    "we shall clarify what we mean by this with examples of electromagnetism and gravitational perturbations in the schwarzschild background .",
    "the fundamental concept we want to present here is that , except for a scalar field , there are many features of a field that are encoded in different mathematical packages . because a gravitational perturbation , with its 10 degrees of freedom is an unnecessarily complicated way to start , but a scalar perturbation is too simple , the complexity `` goldilocks zone '' is occupied by electromagnetic perturbation of a schwarzschild background .    in this case , at any point in spacetime , there are 6 degrees of freedom that can be considered to be the 3 components of the electric field , and the 3 of the magnetic field ; alternatively they can be considered the 6 independent components of the maxwell 4-tensor .",
    "the partial differential equations for this system , maxwell s equations in the schwarzschild background , are uselessly messy in terms of the individual vector or tensor components . a very effective way of repackaging these quantities is to use the 3 complex fields of the newman - penrose ( np ) formalism .",

    "notice too that eq .   tells us that a similar awkwardness applies to a reflecting surface at large @xmath49 .",
    "heuristically , this awkwardness can be traced to the fact that the reflection condition involves a balance of ingoing and outgoing radiation , and the np quantities are specific to one or the other .",
    "this suggests that reflection problems are best handled in a computation using the `` balanced '' np field @xmath67 . from eqs .    and",

    "one possibility for dealing with the local boundary conditions is for example , solve for @xmath37 , and from the solution find @xmath74 . in electromagnetism , finding @xmath63 from @xmath66 required two derivatives with respect to advanced time , and was numerically delicate .",
    "for gravitational perturbations the situation is worse ; finding @xmath74 from @xmath37 requires four differentiations with respect to advanced time .    for gravitational perturbations of the schwarzschild spacetime with reflection conditions ,",
    "the difficulty can be avoided by using the zerilli or regge - wheeler equations , which , like @xmath65 in the electromagnetic case , are not skewed to ingoing or outgoing wave propagation .",

    "furthermore , later and later echoes of an infinite string of echoes , do not approach a ringing at a qn frequency . in general , a scattering viewpoint involving the curvature potential , where applicable , gives a better heuristic view of the process of signal generation than a qn analysis or considerations of a light ring .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to warn of a pitfall in using the teukolsky  @xcite wave function @xmath37 for analyzing the effect of reflecting `` walls '' outside the horizon .",
    "simply setting dirichlet or neumann conditions on this wave function , for example , is not an expression of a locally reflecting wall .    _",
