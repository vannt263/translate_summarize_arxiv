    "2006 ) , we were able to take co ( 230.5 ghz ) and @xmath1co  ( 220.4 ghz ) , j=@xmath2 , spectra simultaneously through the same telescope optics .",
    "we used a filterbank spectrometer to record both the co and @xmath1co   emission simultaneously .",
    "each of the two j=@xmath2 lines was measured with 256 filters of 0.25  mhz bandwidth , giving a total spectral coverage of @xmath27 km  s@xmath5   at a resolution of 0.33 km  s@xmath5 .",

    "our spectra extend from @xmath29 to 30 km  s@xmath5  ( lsr ) so we detect all gas in the cloud .",
    "observations were made by the  on - the - fly \" ( otf ) method , where the telescope was scanned in a boustrophedonic pattern in right ascension at a scan rate of 10@xmath30/sec , with spectra sampled every 0.1 sec . in subsequent processing ,",
    "the data were smoothed by 4 samples or 0.4 sec , corresponding to a telescope motion of 4@xmath30 per spectrum .",
    "the beam size at the co j=@xmath2 observing frequency is 32@xmath30 ( fwhm ) so this choice of spatial sampling does not cause any significant loss of angular resolution in the scan direction .",
    "a raster of lines with 10@xmath30 spacing in declination or @xmath31 of the beam fwhm was observed in this way . the telescope resolution is well - sampled in both coordinates with this choice of otf mapping parameters .",
    "the field to be mapped was divided into 39 subfields , each @xmath32 in size , plus a small overlap .",
    "each subfield was observed at least once in each of the two co isotopes .",
    "total scanning time per subfield was therefore 2.0 hours , plus @xmath730% overhead for telescope slewing and measurement of reference spectra after every other row .",
    "subfields were re - observed in whole or part if weather conditions resulted in excessively high noise levels .",
    "the telescope pointing accuracy was checked at the start of each observing period by measuring the co j=@xmath2 emission from the red giant star v1111 oph , which has strong co emission lines from its circumstellar molecular envelope .",
    "this object is a good pointing calibrator because the stellar emission is compact and centered on the well - known position of the star , which is only about 10@xmath33  from our serpens field .",
    "a 5-point cross pattern centered on the star was measured and the integrated line intensities at the 5 positions were fitted to determine the pointing corrections in azimuth and elevation .",
    "these corrections were generally @xmath34",
    ". the pointing was checked and corrected about every 2 hours throughout each observing run , so the pointing errors during the otf mapping should be @xmath34 .",
    "the intensity scale was determined with the standard method of kutner & ulich ( 1981 ) by comparing an ambient temperature load with on - sky spectra near the target field , to give the spectral line intensity on the @xmath35  scale .",
    "the sideband rejections for the mixers were measured each time the receiver was tuned .",
    "we observed a standard position , w51d , to place all the otf data on a consistent main - beam brightness temperature scale , in the manner described in bieging et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "all of the otf data were processed in the _ class _ software package of the grenoble astrophysics group .",
    "a linear baseline was removed from each spectrum and the data for each spectral channel were convolved to a square grid in r.a . and dec .",
    ", with a 10@xmath30 grid spacing in both coordinates .",
    "the gridding algorithm uses a circular gaussian weighting function with a fwhm of 0.3@xmath36(beam fwhm ) , to convolve the otf - sampled spectra onto the regular grid points .",
    "the gridding thereby increased the effective angular resolution by a factor of @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting data cubes were transferred to the _ miriad _ software format ( sault , teuben , & wright 1995 ) for subsequent processing and analysis . to facilitate the comparison of co and @xmath1co  lines ( for example , to calculate line ratios at each pixel ) , we used the _ miriad _ task _ regrid _ to resample the data cubes on the velocity axis by 3rd order interpolation .",
    "we chose to sample velocities at 0.15 km  s@xmath5  intervals from @xmath29 to @xmath38 km  s@xmath5  ( lsr ) , so that the original velocity resolution was oversampled by a factor of 2.2 .    to match the angular resolutions of the co and @xmath1co   j=@xmath2 maps , which differ by @xmath39 because of the difference in line rest frequencies , we convolved the images with gaussians chosen to give identical resolutions for the two isotopologues .",
    "the effective resolution of the final maps was 38@xmath30 ( fwhm ) for both the co and @xmath1co  images .",
    "this additional spatial smoothing also reduced the surface brightness noise level , at only a small cost in angular resolution .",
    "we calculated the rms noise in an emission - free velocity range for each map pixel .",
    "[ fig : rms_map ] shows the resulting distribution of the noise . the co j=@xmath2 image _ ( left ) _ has relatively uniform noise over the whole field , with a mean value of @xmath40  k ( main beam brightness ) per pixel and per velocity channel , with variations of @xmath41 about this value over most of the map . for the entire @xmath1co  image _ ( right ) _ the mean @xmath42  k with comparable levels of variation due to differences in weather ( i.e. , sky noise ) and source elevation when the individual subfields were observed .",
