    "two fundamentally different phenomenological pictures of hadronic matter have developed over the past twenty years .",
    "one is the constituent quark model where hadrons are pictured as being made of a few heavy quarks bound by a confining potential . here ,",
    "zweig s rule implies that very little of a hadron s momentum is carried by gluons .",
    "the other is the quark - parton model which is valid at higher energy scales . in this picture ,",
    "a hadron is composed of an indefinite number of light quarks and most of the hadron momentum is carried by gluons .",
    "we believe that the underlying theory for both of these disparate pictures is the non - abelian gauge theory quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is believed that the light - front formulation of qcd is our best hope of joining the constituent quark model with the parton model and qcd . in this elegant approach",
    "the field theory is quantized on the null plane surface @xmath4 instead of the usual equal - time surface @xmath5 .",
    "this formulation avoids many of the difficult problems that appear in the equal - time formulation of field theory .    in the light - front formalism",
    "the energy operator does not have a square root operator , and , consequently , the vacuum structure is relatively simple .",
    "dirac  @xcite , in 1949 , showed that a maximum number of poincar generators become independent of the dynamics in the `` front form '' formulation , including certain lorentz boosts .",
    "the eigenstates of the light - front hamiltonian have lorentz scalars @xmath6 as eigenvalues and describe bound states of arbitrary four - momentum and invariant mass @xmath7 , allowing easy computation of scattering amplitudes and other dynamical quantities . however , the most remarkable feature of this formalism is the apparent simplicity of the vacuum .",
    "the fock space vacuum is an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian . in other words , the bare vacuum _ is _ the physical vacuum .",
    "more detail is given in a recent review  @xcite .",
    "for the past several years an increasingly large group of physicists has attempting to combine tamm - dancoff  @xcite procedures with light - front quantization in order to perform non - perturbative calculations in quantum field theory .",
    "the assumptions , consistent with the constituent quark model picture , are that a hadron is well approximated by only a few particles and that adding more particles only refines this initial approximation .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the equal - time formulation of qcd where an infinite number of gluons are essential to construct even the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "if these efforts are successful , they could lead to procedures for calculating not only the hadron mass spectrum but all the quantities which depend on hadron wavefunctions : structure functions , fragmentation functions , _ et cetera_.    the origin of this remarkably simple vacuum in the light - front formalism is that conservation of @xmath8 requires @xmath9 .",
    "however , @xmath10 for massive particles , and the total light - front hamiltonian annihilates the perturbative vacuum .",
    "in contrast , the physical vacuum in equal - time quantization is a highly complex composite of pair fluctuations which is believed to produce all phenomena that require long range order : color confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , the goldstone pion , _",
    "et cetera_. how can one obtain such non - trivial properties in the light - front formulation of field theory ?",
    "these phenomena occur in light - front field theory because the field includes a zero mode operator  @xcite which is not an independent degree of freedom .",
    "this mode is a complicated operator - valued function of all other modes in the theory and , since it carries zero momentum , it can provide long range order .",
    "this problem has recently been attacked from several directions .",
    "the question of whether boundary conditions can be consistently defined in light - front quantization has been discussed by mccartor and robertson  @xcite and lenz  @xcite .",
    "they have shown that for massive theories the energy and momentum derived from light - front quantization are conserved and are equivalent to the energy and momentum one would normally write down in an equal - time theory .",
    "in the analyses of lenz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and hornbostel  @xcite one traces the fate of the equal time vacuum in the limit @xmath11 and equivalently in the limit @xmath12 when rotating the evolution parameter @xmath13 from the equal - time frame to the light - front frame .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have considered @xmath0 theory in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions and solved the zero - mode constraint equation by truncating the equation to one particle and retaining all modes .",
    "they implicitly retain a two particle contribution in order to obtain finite results .",
    "( we will discuss this in detail later . )",
    "they find a critical coupling for the onset of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "other authors  @xcite find that , for theories allowing spontaneous symmetry breaking , there is a degeneracy of light - front vacua and the true vacuum state can differ from the perturbative vacuum through the addition of zero mode quanta .",
    "in addition to these approaches there are many others  @xcite .",
    "we present here a discussion of the zero - mode constraint equation for ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0 field theory [ @xmath14 with symmetric boundary conditions and show how spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs within the context of this model .",
    "this work builds upon the investigation of the one mode case by bender , pinsky , and van de sande in ref .",
    "our basic approach is to apply a tamm - dancoff truncation to the fock space .",
    "we restrict the number of particles and the number of modes to be less than some finite limit .",
    "this means that we can represent any operator by a finite matrix and solve the operator valued constraint equation numerically .",
    "the truncation assumes that states with a large number of particles or large momentum do not have an important contribution to the zero mode .",
    "we find the following general behavior : for small coupling ( large @xmath15 , where  @xmath16 ) the constraint equation has a single solution and the field has no vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . as we increase the coupling ( decrease @xmath15 ) to what we will call the `` critical coupling '' @xmath17 , two additional solutions which give the field a nonzero vev appear .",
    "these solutions differ only infinitesimally from the first solution near the critical coupling , indicating the presence of a second order phase transition . above the critical coupling ( @xmath18 )",
    ", there are three solutions : one with zero vev , the `` unbroken phase , '' and two with nonzero vev , the `` broken phase . ''",
    "as shown in fig .  1 , one can plot the vev as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "we will call these the `` critical curves . ''    in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath15 large ) the solution to the constraint equation can be obtained in perturbation theory .",
    "this solution does not break the @xmath1 symmetry and is believed to simply insert the missing zero momentum contributions into internal propogators .",
    "this must happen if light - front perturbation theory is to agree with equal - time perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "this has been shown for @xmath19 theory in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions  @xcite and we believe that it happens here as well .    since the vacuum in this theory is trivial , all of the long range properties must occur in the operator structure of the hamiltonian . above the critical coupling ( @xmath18 ) quantum oscillations spontaneously",
    "break the @xmath1 symmetry of the theory . in a loose analogy with a symmetric",
    "double well potential , we have two new hamiltonians for the broken phase , each producing states localized in one of the wells .",
    "the structure of the two hamiltonians is determined from the broken phase solutions of the zero mode constraint equation .",
    "we find that the two hamiltonians have equivalent spectra . in a discrete theory without zero modes it is well known that , if one increases the coupling sufficiently , quantum correction will generate tachyons causing the theory to break down near the critical coupling . here",
    "the zero mode generates new interactions that prevent tachyons from developing . in effect",
    "what happens is that , while quantum corrections attempt to drive the mass negative , they also change the vacuum energy through the zero mode and the diving mass eigenvalue can never catch the vacuum eigenvalue .",
    "thus , tachyons never appear in our spectra .",
    "another way to investigate the zero mode is to study the spectrum of the field operator @xmath2 .",
    "here we find a picture that agrees with the symmetric double well potential analogy . in the broken phase",
    ", the field is localized in one of the minima of the potential and there is tunneling to the other minimum .    in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the derivation of the zero - mode constraint equation and the formal operator constraint equation that relates the zero mode to all the other modes in the problem . in sec .",
    "iii we apply a truncation allowing only the first nonzero mode and many particles . in sec .",
    "iv we examine the truncation where we allow many modes and only one particle . next , in sec .",
    "v , truncations with several particles and several modes are examined . in sec .",
    "vi , we examine the spectrum of the field operator @xmath20 . finally , in sec .",
    "vii we discuss our results and the remaining work needed on this problem .",
    "the details of the dirac - bergmann prescription and its application to the system considered in this paper are discussed elsewhere in the literature  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we will summarize those results and introduce our notation .",
    "we define light - front coordinates @xmath21 . for a classical field",
    "the @xmath22 lagrangian is @xmath23 we put the system in a box of length @xmath24 and impose periodic boundary conditions . for most of our discussion we work in momentum space .",
    "we define @xmath25 by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and summations run over all integers unless otherwise noted . following the dirac - bergmann prescription ,",
    "we can identify first - class constraints which define the conjugate momenta and a secondary constraint which determines the `` zero - mode '' @xmath28 in terms of the other modes in the theory .",
    "this result can also be obtained by integrating the equations of motion in position space or differentiating the hamiltonian with respect to the zero mode  @xcite .",
    "quantizing , we define creation and annihilation operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 by , @xmath31 which satisfy the usual commutation relations @xmath32 = 0\\ ; , \\quad\\left[a_k^\\dagger , a_l^\\dagger\\right ] = 0\\;,\\quad \\left[a_k , a_l^\\dagger\\right ] = \\delta_{k , l}\\ ; , \\quad k , l > 0\\ ; .\\ ] ] likewise , we define the zero mode operator @xmath33 it is useful to define the quantity , @xmath34 general arguments suggest that the hamiltonian should be symmetric ordered  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how one should treat the zero mode since it is not a dynamical field . as an _ ansatz",
    "_ we will treat @xmath35 as an ordinary field operator when symmetric ordering the hamiltonian .",
    "rescaling @xmath36 , the quantum hamiltonian is  @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "we have removed tadpoles from the symmetric ordered hamiltonian by normal ordering the third and fourth terms and subtracting , @xmath39 in addition , we have subtracted a constant @xmath40 so that the vev of @xmath41 is zero .",
    "note that this renormalization prescription is equivalent to a conventional mass renormalization and does not introduce any new operators ( aside from the constant ) into the hamiltonian .",
    "the constraint equation for the zero - mode can be obtained by taking a derivative of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , we symmetric order the constraint equation : @xmath42 using the constraint equation , we can rewrite @xmath41 as : @xmath43 it is clear from the general structure of ( [ constraint ] ) that @xmath35 as a function of the other modes is not necessarily odd under the transform @xmath44 , @xmath45 associated with the @xmath1 symmetry of the system .",
    "consequently , the zero mode can induce @xmath1 symmetry breaking in the hamiltonian .",
    "along with the zero mode and the hamiltonian , @xmath46 commutes with the longitudinal momentum operator , @xmath47 = 0 \\quad               \\left[h , p^+\\right ] = 0 \\quad               \\left[\\sigma_n , p^+\\right ] = 0   \\ ; .\\ ] ]    in order to render the problem tractable , we impose a tamm - dancoff truncation on the fock space . define @xmath48 to be the number of nonzero modes and @xmath49 to be the maximum number of allowed particles .",
    "thus , each state in the truncated fock space can be represented by a vector of length @xmath50 and operators can be represented by @xmath51 matrices .",
    "one can define the usual fock space basis , @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath54 in matrix form , @xmath35 is real and symmetric . moreover , it is block diagonal in states of equal @xmath8 eigenvalue . due to the fock space truncation ,",
    "the commutator @xmath55 $ ] is somewhat different than its full fock space counterpart .",
    "we will use the full fock space commutators to move creation operators to the left as much as possible in a product before performing any matrix multiplications .",
    "in this section we review the results of ref .  @xcite .",
    "consider the case of one mode @xmath56 and many particles . in this case , the zero - mode is diagonal and can be written as @xmath57 note that @xmath35 in ( [ onemode ] ) is even under @xmath44 , @xmath45 and any non - zero solution breaks the @xmath1 symmetry of the original hamiltonian .",
    "the vev is given by @xmath58 substituting ( [ onemode ] ) into the constraint equation ( [ constraint ] ) and sandwiching the constraint equation between fock states , we get a recursion relation for @xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and we define @xmath62 to be unknown . consequently , @xmath63 is uniquely determined by a given choice of @xmath15 and @xmath64 . in particular , if @xmath65 all the @xmath66 s are zero independent of @xmath15 .",
    "this is the unbroken phase .",
    "our first objective is to determine which solutions of the recursion relation are consistent with the tamm - dancoff truncation .",
    "if @xmath67 is large for large @xmath68 then the high energy levels will be strongly affected .",
    "the paradigm for spontaneous symmetry breaking is the symmetric double well potential in ordinary quantum mechanics which has a ground state centered in either well rather than at the symmetry point .",
    "this paradigm indicates that the behavior of the system is unaffected by the barrier for energies far above the barrier separating the wells .",
    "hence , we only seek solutions where @xmath67 is small for large @xmath68 .",
    "we caution here that this paradigm does not translate entirely to the light - front formulation since the symmetry breaking occurs in the hamiltonian and the vacuum itself is unaffected .",
    "we begin our analysis of eq .",
    "( [ recursion ] ) by dropping the cubic term and finding solutions to the resulting linear system .",
    "assume for now that @xmath69 and that @xmath70 is decreasing with @xmath68 . for large @xmath68 , the terms linear in @xmath68 dominate , eq .",
    "( [ recursion ] ) becomes @xmath71 there are two solutions to this equation : @xmath72 we reject the plus solution because it grows with @xmath68 .",

    "the function @xmath75 satisfies a differential equation whose solution is @xmath80 note that this solution for @xmath75 has singularities at the expected values of @xmath81 .",
    "if we want @xmath67 to have the asymptotic behavior @xmath82 for large @xmath68 , then we must eliminate the branch point of @xmath75 at @xmath83 .",
    "this gives the condition @xmath84 concentrating on the @xmath85 case , we find a critical coupling @xmath86 or @xmath87 consistent with equal - time calculations  @xcite .",
    "the solution to the linearized equation is an approximate solution to the full equation  ( [ recursion ] ) for @xmath64 sufficiently small .",
    "we need to determine solutions of the full nonlinear equation which converge for large @xmath68 .",
    "we will use both the @xmath88-expansion and numerical methods to do this .",
    "+ the @xmath88-expansion is a powerful perturbative technique for linearizing nonlinear problems .",
    "it has been shown to be an accurate technique for solving problems in differential equations , quantum mechanics , and quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ recursion ] ) as @xmath89 setting @xmath90 gives the linear finite difference equation which is the zeroth - order approximation in the @xmath88-expansion .",
    "one then expands in powers of @xmath88 about @xmath90 .",
    "one recovers the problem of interest at @xmath91 .",
    "we find to first order the critical curve for @xmath91 , @xmath92 these results are plotted as the dashed curve in fig",
    "the expansion behaves badly near @xmath65 because of the @xmath93 term in the expansion .",

    "since we seek a solution where @xmath67 is decreasing with @xmath68 , this is a good approximation .",

    "there are two additional solutions . near",
    "the critical point @xmath99 is small and @xmath100 the critical curves are indicated by the solid lines in fig .  1 .",
    "these solutions converge quite rapidly with @xmath49 .",
    "the critical curve for the broken phase is approximately parabolic in shape : @xmath101 it is instructive to study the behavior of the constraint equation  ( [ recursion ] ) away from the critical curves . in fig",

    "the curves shown are independent of @xmath49 for @xmath49 large .",
    "it is not clear how to interpret these solutions .",
    "we can also study the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian for the one mode case .",

    "the energy levels increase above the value they had without the zero mode .",

    "this is the new paradigm for spontaneous symmetry breaking : multiple vacua are replaced by multiple hamiltonians . picking",
    "the hamiltonian defines the theory in the same sense that picking the vacuum defines the theory in the equal - time paradigm .",
    "the two solutions for @xmath35 are related to each other in a very specific way .",
    "let @xmath174 be the unitary operator associated with the @xmath1 symmetry of the system ; @xmath175 , @xmath45 .",
    "we break up @xmath35 into an even part @xmath176 and an odd part @xmath177 .",
    "the even part @xmath178 breaks the @xmath1 symmetry of the theory . for @xmath179 ,",
    "the three solutions of the constraint equation are : @xmath180 corresponding to the unbroken phase , @xmath181 corresponding to the @xmath182 solution , and @xmath183 for the @xmath184 solution .",
    "thus , the two hamiltonians are @xmath185 and @xmath186 where h has the property @xmath187 and @xmath30 represents the nonzero modes . since @xmath174 is a unitary operator ,",
    "if @xmath188 is an eigenvector of @xmath41 with eigenvalue @xmath189 then @xmath190 is an eigenvalue of @xmath191 with eigenvalue @xmath189 . since , @xmath192 @xmath171 and @xmath172 have the same eigenvalues .",
    "using the @xmath155 , @xmath156 case as an example , let us examine the spectrum of @xmath41 .",
    "removing the zero mode entirely , the rescaled hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is @xmath193 for large @xmath15 the eigenvalues are obviously : @xmath194 , @xmath15 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "however as we decrease @xmath15 one of the last three eigenvalues will be driven negative .",
    "this signals the breakdown of the theory near the critical coupling when the zero mode is not included .",
    "including the zero mode fixes this problem .",
    "9 shows the spectrum for the three lowest nonzero momentum sectors .",
    "this spectrum illustrates several characteristics which seem to hold generally ( at least for truncations we have examined , @xmath200 ) . for the broken phase ,",
    "the vacuum is the lowest energy state , there are no level crossings as a function of @xmath15 , and the theory does not break down in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "none of these are true for the spectrum with the zero mode removed or for the unbroken phase below the critical coupling .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue has a minimum at or near the critical point and the minimum appears to decrease with the number of modes and particles .",
    "a more precise statement will have to await a fully renormalized treatment .",
    "so far we have examined the zero mode and its effect on the spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "how does the zero mode affect the field itself ?",
    "since @xmath2 is a hermitian operator it is an observable of the system and one can measure @xmath2 for a given state @xmath152 .",
    "the result is given by simple quantum mechanics .",
    "let us define the eigenvalues @xmath201 and eigenvectors @xmath202 of @xmath203 : @xmath204 the probability of obtaining @xmath201 as the result of a measurement of @xmath20 for the state @xmath152 is @xmath205 .    in the limit of large @xmath49",
    ", the probability distribution becomes continuous .",
    "if we ignore the zero mode , the probability of obtaining @xmath206 as the result of a measurement of @xmath20 for the vacuum state is @xmath207 where @xmath208 .",
    "the probability distribution comes from the ground state wave function of the harmonic oscillator where we identify @xmath2 with the position operator .",
    "this is just the gaussian fluctuation of a free field .",
    "note that the width of the gaussian diverges logarithmically in @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath49 is finite , the distribution becomes discrete as shown in fig .",
    "10 .    in general",
    ", there are @xmath209 eigenvalues such that @xmath210 , independent of @xmath48 .",
    "thus if we want to examine the spectrum of the field operator for the vacuum state , it is better to choose fock space truncations where @xmath49 is large . with this in mind",
    ", we examine the @xmath211 and @xmath56 case as a function of @xmath15 in fig .",
    ". note that near the critical point , fig .",
    "11a , the distribution is approximately equal to the free field case shown in fig .",
    "there is no symmetry breaking and the field is symmetric about zero . as we move away from the critical point , figs .",
    "11b - d , the distribution becomes increasingly narrow with a peak located at the vev of what would be the minimum of the symmetric double well potential in the equal - time paradigm .",
    "in addition , there is a small peak corresponding to minus the vev . in the language of the equal - time paradigm ,",
    "there is tunneling between the two minima of the potential .",
    "in the context of @xmath22 on the light front , the vacuum of the full theory is always the perturbative vacuum . the zero mode , which satisfies an operator valued constraint equation , produces the long range physics of the theory including spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we have found that the constraint equation can be solved using a tamm - dancoff truncation of the fock space .",
    "even for the one mode truncation , we find a critical coupling consistent with the best equal time calculations .",
    "increasing the tamm - dancoff truncation , we find rapid convergence with the total number of particles @xmath49 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the equal - time approach where an infinite number of particles are required to produce a critical point . in the weak coupling limit",
    ", the zero mode ensures that light - front perturbation theory agrees with equal - time perturbation theory . above the critical coupling the zero mode develops a contribution that breaks the @xmath1 symmetry of the theory .",
    "there are two such solutions to the constraint equation : one with @xmath212 and one with @xmath213 .",
    "this , in turn , gives rise to two hamiltonians which have the same spectrum .",
    "the spectrum has the expected behavior : the fock vacuum is the state of lowest energy and the lowest eigenvalue has a minimum at the critical coupling .",
    "closer inspection of the field shows that tunneling occurs between positive and negative eigenvalues in the broken phase .    in this work",
    ", we apply a simple mass renormalization to the symmetric ordered hamiltonian .",
    "this prescription removes tadpoles from ordinary interaction terms and would properly renormalize the theory if the zero mode were removed .",
    "however , inclusion of the zero mode produces logarithmic divergences in the constraint equation and in the resulting hamiltonian .",
    "this can be seen from figs .",
    "6 and 8 where @xmath17 grows with the number of modes .",
    "the number of modes is equivalent to a large @xmath8 cutoff in a standard discretized light - front quantization calculation .",
    "we therefore believe that this behavior is a renormalization effect related to the fact that the new interactions are not normal ordered . to a very good accuracy ,",
    "@xmath214 this type of logarithmic growth indicates that the system needs further renormalization . the most direct approach would be to find some non - perturbative method of normal ordering the resulting hamiltonian .",
    "another approach is to add a constant to @xmath15 and multiply @xmath147 by a constant so that logarithmic divergences are removed . in the one particle case , this will work .",
    "however , it is unclear if we can successfully extend it to the more general case @xmath215 .",
    "another possibility is to add more operators to the hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , if we add a term of the form @xmath216 , we can remove the logarithmic divergence in the constraint equation .    for @xmath22",
    "we believe that a vanishing of the mass gap is associated with the critical coupling  @xcite . in fig .",
    "7 we see that the gap between the vacuum and the lowest energy excited state is minimized at the critical coupling .",
    "one could imagine that , in the limit of large @xmath48 , the gap between the vacuum and the first excited state goes to zero at the critical coupling .",
    "however , the first excited state is the one with the largest longitudinal momentum and is always at the `` edge '' of our fock space truncation in @xmath48 .",
    "thus , our fock space truncation may not be particularly well suited for an investigation of the vanishing of the mass gap .",
    "we chose @xmath22 as a model for its simplicity .",
    "one problem with this choice is that the scalar field @xmath2 is dimensionless .",
    "power counting arguments suggest that arbitrary powers of @xmath2 are allowed in the hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , the zero mode can be a very complicated object for this model .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath0 theory in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions the only allowed local operators are @xmath217 , @xmath218 . for physically interesting theories like qcd ,",
    "the operators that are allowed by power counting arguments are much more restricted  @xcite .",
    "however , they still allow a very large set of operators and are therefore in some sense similar to the @xmath22 example .",
    "solution of the zero mode problem for the model we chose may be conceptually more difficult .    in theories like qcd we expect to have , in addition , zero modes that are dynamical degrees of freedom . a recent study of pure glue qcd in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions shows that the zero mode of @xmath219 has this property  @xcite .",
    "thus , in qcd , we expect to have dynamical as well as nondynamical zero modes making the problem quite complicated .",
