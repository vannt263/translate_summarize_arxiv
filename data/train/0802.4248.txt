    "optimal solutions for quantum information processing tasks typically require observables that can not be described by single selfadjoint operators but are formalized as positive - operator - valued measures ( povms ) . generally , an element of an observable , called an _ effect _ , can be any positive operator bounded by the identity operator .",
    "for instance , an optimal observable for unambiguous discrimination of two non - orthogonal pure states has three elements and none of them is a projection @xcite .",
    "another example is provided by informationally complete observables , which do not have any non - trivial projections as their elements @xcite .",
    "it is well known that two projections can be elements of a single observable if and only if they commute .",
    "this condition for effects to be parts of a single observable is called _ coexistence _ @xcite .",
    "coexistence can be therefore viewed as a kind of natural generalization of commutativity .",
    "it is remarkable that two effects can be coexistent even if they do not commute , but a general criterion of coexistence is not known .",
    "this problem of characterizing coexistent effects , called the _ coexistence problem _ , is the topic of this paper .",
    "the coexistence of effects is connected to the theoretical limitations built inside the quantum theory , and the concept of coexistence provides a unifying framework for these kinds of issues .",
    "indeed , many theoretical limitations , related both to the foundations and to quantum information processing tasks , can be seen as a consequence of ( non-)coexistence of the relevant effects .",
    "for instance , the security of bennett - brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) protocol @xcite relies on the non - coexistence of the corresponding effects .",
    "moreover , assuming that the bell inequality is violated , the coexistence of certain effects would lead to the possibility of superluminal communication @xcite .",
    "coexistence ( contrary to commutativity ) also explains the possibility of unsharp joint measurements of complementary pairs of physical quantities , such as orthogonal spin components or path and interference of an atomic beam .",
    "a joint measurement of such pairs is possible only if an increased unsharpness is accepted , and a relevant coexistence condition can be then interpreted as a trade - off relation between the imprecisions of the corresponding measurements .",
    "some recent investigations on this issue are reported , for instance , in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we give a complete characterization of the previously stated coexistence problem in the case of two qubit effects . in sec .",
    "[ sec : problem ] we recall the coexistence problem in a precise formulation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fundamental ] we present the main result of this paper  a characterization theorem of coexistent pairs of qubit effects .",
    "we also show that the already known special cases are easily recovered from our theorem . a detailed proof of the characterization theorem is given in the appendixes . in appendix 1 we recall some general facts on coexistence which are needed in our investigation .",
    "appendix 2 then concentrates on the details of the proof .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complex separable hilbert space .",
    "an operator @xmath1 on @xmath0 is an _ effect _ if @xmath2 for all @xmath3 . in terms of operator inequalities",
    "this reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the zero operator and the identity operator , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the set of effects .",
    "an _ observable _ @xmath8 is a normalized - effect - valued measure , also called a positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "it is defined on a measurable space @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the set of measurement outcomes and @xmath11 is the @xmath12-algebra of possible events . for each event @xmath13 , the observable @xmath8 attaches an effect @xmath14 . if the system is in a vector state @xmath3 and a measurement of @xmath8 is performed , the probability of getting a measurement outcome @xmath15 belonging to an event @xmath13 is @xmath16 .",
    "detailed explanations and many examples of this generalized description of quantum observables can be found in @xcite .    for a singleton set @xmath17 ,",
    "we denote @xmath18 .",
    "if the set of measurement outcomes @xmath10 is countable , then @xmath8 is determined by the set of effects @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",

    "the povm normalization condition then reads @xmath24    we can also look on the structure of observables from the other side : given a collection of effects , we can ask whether they originate in a single observable .",

    "this fact will become evident later in the proof .",
    "four circles can intersect in one point in three distinct ways :    * 2ci  two circles intersect in one point and this point lies inside of the two remaining circles .",
    "we will see that one of the possible 2ci intersections defines the boundary of @xmath169 , which is formed by vectors @xmath61 of length @xmath60 , leading to conditions ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) .",
    "* 3ci  three circles intersect in one point , but out of these three , no two circles intersect in one point and the point lies strictly inside of the fourth circle .",
    "it will turn out that a 3ci case never defines a boundary point of @xmath169  a necessary condition for a 3ci implies that one of these three circles contains another one and therefore can be disregarded , forcing the case to be a 2ci case . *",
    "4ci  there is a point laying on the boundary of all four circles , but this point does not lead to 2ci .",
    "such intersections define the boundary formed by vectors @xmath61 shorter than @xmath60 , leading to condition ( c3 ) .",

    "this assumption simplifies our investigation a bit and we will later in step 4 check that this case is also covered by the final result .      if @xmath61 is on the boundary of the allowed region and it is a 2ci case , then there is @xmath178 such that two circles intersect in a point that is inside the remaining two circles and there is no @xmath159 for which the intersection has a nonzero area .",
    "then the two circles making the single point intersection can not be the circles 1 and 3 as both these circles radii grow with @xmath159  we could enlarge @xmath178 by a small amount such that the circles 1 and 3 would intersect in a nonzero area and the two remaining circles would not move enough to leave this area .",
    "we would thus obtain a four circle intersection of a nonzero area , which contradicts proposition [ main idea ] .",
    "similarly , a boundary point formed by 2ci can not be due to the circles 2 and 4  they both grow if we decrease @xmath159 .",
    "moreover , a boundary point can arise neither from circles 1 and 2 , since they do not change with changing @xmath61 , nor circles 3 and 4 , which shift by the same amount when @xmath61 is changed .",
    "a single point intersection of circles 2 and 3 implies equality @xmath179 , which is never the case since we have restricted ourselves to the case @xmath180 .",
    "the only possibility is that a single point intersection is formed by circles 1 and 4 , leading to the condition @xmath124 .",
    "we will now specify when a vector @xmath61 of length @xmath60 is in the allowed region @xmath169 . in this case",
