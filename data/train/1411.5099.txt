    "experiments are conducted in a horizontal hele - shaw cell consisting in two transparent acrylate plates separated by a small gap initially filled by a solution of sodium silicate .",
    "a solution of cobalt chloride ( cocl@xmath0 ) is injected radially from the center of the lower plate at a fixed flow rate . upon contact and displacement of one reactant solution by the other one",
    ", precipitation occurs and various dynamics and patterns are observed when the concentration of sodium silicate and cocl@xmath0 are varied ( see fig.[diagram ] ) .",
    "the global trend of the phase diagram is that , if one reagent is much more concentrated than the other one , a rather circular precipitation pattern is obtained .",
    "this precipitate is concentrated at the outer rim as dark petals of _ flowers _ out of which viscous fingers grow if the sodium silicate is the more concentrated reagent . at the beginning of the injection",
    ", precipitation occurs inside the viscous fingers whereas at longer times , the precipitate lags behind them .",
    "if , on the contrary , the metal salt is much more concentrated than the sodium silicate , a compact circular pink precipitate grows radially . above a critical radius ,",
    "we observe a destabilization of the circle rim towards small scale _ hairs _ growing radially with a characteristic wavelength .",
    "when the concentration of both reactants is in the large range of fig.[diagram ] , thin _",
    "filaments _ growing with complex turn arounds are observed .",
    "along the fifth column of the phase diagram , the transition from flowers to filaments occurs smoothly when the concentration of cocl@xmath0 is increased at this fixed large concentration in sodium silicate .",
    "intermediate concentrations are characterized by _ worms _ as seen in the lower middle zone of the diagram .",
    "these worm patterns are reminiscent of structures observed in micellar systems when a viscous gel product is formed _ in - situ _ at the interface between reactive aqueous solutions  @xcite . at later time , terrace - like precipitate layers grow along the first structure .        along the lower line of the phase diagram , _ i.e. _ at a large concentration in cocl@xmath0 , the transition upon an increase of the sodium silicate concentration from hairs to worms and eventually filaments transits at intermediate values via the most compact precipitate structure from all those observed .    in the upper middle zone ( squares @xmath1 to @xmath2 in fig.[diagram ] ) , _ spirals _ growing upon successive break - ups of precipitate walls are observed",
    ". a zoom in on some of these spirals ( fig.[spiral_examples ] ) shows that , after a longer time , other precipitates with a rich variety of colors start growing diffusively out of their semi - permeable walls .",
    "a preliminary test with raman microscopy has shown that some green precipitates ( like in fig.[spiral_examples ] for instance ) is made of co(oh)@xmath0 and co@xmath3o@xmath4 , compounds also found in the inner surface of 3d tubes  @xcite .",

    "the scale bars correspond to 1 cm . ]",
    "we note that friction phenomena with the cell plates do not seem to be crucial to understand the properties of the patterns as no stick / slip phenomena are observed during the growth of the patterns .",
    "preliminary data also show that the area @xmath8 enclosed by the visible spiral , worm and filament patterns scales linearly with time with an angular coefficient proportional to the flow rate @xmath9 divided by the gap @xmath10 of the hele - shaw cell , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that the related patterns hence span the whole gap of the reactor .",
    "additional experiments must be conducted to obtain statistical information on such growth properties for these patterns and for the other structures observed .    in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the spiral shape precipitate , since it is a robust pattern existing over a quite large range of concentrations and is also formed in reversed gardens , _",
    "i.e. _ when sodium silicate is used as the injected fluid ( fig.[spiral_examples]c and d ) .",
    "the spiral formation mechanism can be understood with a minimal geometrical argument . consider a reagent 1 injected radially from a source point @xmath12 into reagent 2 in a 2d system ( fig.[spiral]a ) .",
    "the contact zone between the reactive solutions , in which precipitation occurs , initially grows as a circle of arbitrarily small radius @xmath13 . if , because of further injection , this layer of precipitate breaks at a critical value @xmath14 , the new precipitate , formed as the bubble of reagent 1 expands , pushes the already existing solid layer . as a result ,",
    "the branch of solid precipitate starts being advected out of the growing bubble and rotates as a whole around the breaking point which later on identifies to being the tip of the spiral ( see also movies s2 and s3 of growing spirals ) .",
    "an arc of spiral is hence observed to develop with its tip moving in the fixed frame of reference centered on @xmath12 .",
    "it further grows by precipitation at its tail located on the circle of growing radius @xmath15 .",
    "the equation of the resulting curly - shaped precipitation layer is obtained by considering two infinitesimally close time steps as shown in fig.[spiral]a . at time @xmath16 , the precipitate layer formed at time @xmath17 is pushed away by the newly added material and rotates by an angle @xmath18 .",
    "the precipitate layer produced between @xmath17 and @xmath16 is created from the reaction occurring at the new section of the contact line between the two reagents  @xcite . since this new section of contact line is generated by the bubble expansion , its length @xmath19 is proportional to the increase of perimeter ( @xmath20 ) of the expanding bubble , namely @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant growth rate controlling the length of the precipitate layer created as the bubble radius increases .",
    "a large value of @xmath22 implies that the length @xmath19 of the new segment of precipitate created at @xmath16 is large compared to the increase of length @xmath23 along the radial direction and leads to a more coiled spiral .    upon integration of eq.([ds1 ] ) we get @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the length of the curve from the tip to the tail .",
    "the constant of integration was fixed by considering that the tip of the curve ( @xmath26 ) is generated from a circle of radius @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , the radius @xmath13 of the expanding bubble coincides with the radius of curvature @xmath28 of the tail since the bubble is also the osculating circle ( see fig.[spiral]a )",
    ". therefore , we obtain @xmath29 which is the cesro equation of a logarithmic spiral giving the evolution of the radius of curvature along the curve as a function of the arclength  @xcite ( see si text for more details ) .    alternatively , we can also proceed as follows to obtain the expression of the spiral curve in polar coordinates .",
    "to derive this equation , the relation existing between @xmath23 and @xmath18 should be known everywhere along the curve in the fixed frame of reference centered around @xmath12 . for non moving curves ,",
    "this relation is usually found by analyzing how @xmath23 varies in a sector of constant central angle @xmath18 which rotates to span the entire curve . in our case",
    ", the growing arc of spiral is moving in a fixed system of coordinates centered on the source point @xmath12 .",
    "its @xmath30 equation is therefore alternatively obtained by considering a non moving sector of constant central angle @xmath18 as in fig.[spiral]a and analyzing how @xmath23 varies in it when the curve spans this angular sector thanks to its motion ( see si text ) .",
    "as seen in fig.[spiral]a , the length @xmath19 of the precipitate layer added at @xmath16 in the fixed sector of angle @xmath18 is given by @xmath31 which , at first order in @xmath32 and @xmath18 , reduces to @xmath33 combining ( [ ds1 ] ) and ( [ ds2 ] ) , we get @xmath34 which is readily integrated to yield @xmath35 @xmath36 is a constant of integration that can be computed for each spiral if we note that @xmath37 fixes the starting point of the spiral _ i.e_. its tip . reminding that the tip originated from the breaking by injection of the initial small circle of radius @xmath27 , the radius of curvature of the spiral at @xmath37 is nothing else than @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 which relates the constant of integration @xmath36 to @xmath27 .",
    "it is of interest to note that eq.([log ] ) exactly describes the ( blue ) segments of spiral of fig.[spiral]a in the frame of reference centered on @xmath12 provided this segment is translated and rotated such that the center @xmath39 of the spiral coincides with @xmath12 ( see si text )",
    ".    equation ( [ log ] ) constructs a logarithmic spiral in polar coordinates and quantitatively describe structures in many natural systems such as seashells , snails , or the horns of animals where the growth mechanism preserves the overall shape by the simple addition of new material in successive self - similar steps  @xcite .",
    "it appears thus logical that a similar logarithmic shape is recovered here in the case of regular additional precipitation at the tail of a growing arc of solid precipitate upon further injection of reactants at a fixed flow rate .",
    "equation ( [ log ] ) quantitatively describes the spiral structures observed in a large part of our phase diagram as demonstrated in the next section .",
    "to test our geometrical model , the radii of 173 spirals observed in 9 experiments for 7 pairs of concentrations ( sectors @xmath40 of fig.[diagram ] ) have been measured as a function of the polar angle ( see fig.[spiral]b and si text ) .",
    "we have selected precipitate layers which were not deformed by other structures growing in their neighborhood or fractured . among them , we have also selected sufficiently coiled segments such that their polar angle span the interval @xmath41 $ ] with @xmath42 @xmath43 in order to obtain significant constraints on the model , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath44 large enough in fig.3b .",
    "indeed , segments which are not sufficiently coiled can not be used to determine the type of spiral emerging in the system . if the interval spanned by @xmath45",
    "is too small , eq.(4 ) is hardly distinguishable from the equation @xmath46 describing an archimedean spiral .",
    "the distribution of @xmath47 among the analyzed spirals is shown in fig.s7 .",
    "as seen in fig.[spiral]b , where the radial distance and the polar angle are rescaled by @xmath36 and @xmath22 respectively , all the analyzed spiral profiles collapse onto an exponential master curve , illustrating that indeed they are all logarithmic to a good accuracy .",
    "the dispersion occurring at low @xmath45 ( near the spiral center ) is related to the fact that the experimental spiral structures emerge from an arc of an initial tiny circular section of radius @xmath27 .",
    "63 other spirals corresponding to the inverted cases @xmath1 and @xmath48 ( _ i.e. _ sodium silicate injected into cobalt chloride ) have also been analyzed and prove to follow the same logarithmic scaling law ( see fig.s4h ) .",
    "we note that , in our confined gardens , the spiral growth continues only as long as the precipitate can pivot within the system .",
    "when it becomes pinned by encountering a solid wall or another precipitate , the spiral growth ceases , the membrane breaks , and a new radial source is produced , leading regularly to a new fresh spiral .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the periodic pressure oscillations reported in the growth of some 3d chemical gardens  @xcite .",
    "thus self - similar logarithmic spirals emerging in a significant part of the phase diagram can be quantitatively analyzed on the basis of a simple geometrical argument .",
    "the model , which describes an isolated source producing a circular precipitation zone that then ruptures , proves to be robust even when spirals are interacting , as in the current experiments .",
    "this work shows that new insight into the complexity of self - assembled chemical garden structures can be obtained by growing them by injection of reactive solutions in confined geometries .",
    "the control of the concentrations of the reagents and of the flow rate will allow the study of phase diagrams in reproducible experimental conditions  @xcite , as well as the switch from dominant reaction  diffusion processes to flow - driven ones .",
    "moreover , the quasi-2d nature of the precipitates will permit , as done here , an easier characterization of the patterns using tools of classical 2d pattern selection analysis  @xcite .",
    "modeling and numerical simulations of this injection - driven aggregation process will thus be simplified .",
    "this will facilitate the analysis of growth mechanisms and of the relative effects of reactions , hydrodynamics and mechanics in the resulting structure ; a prerequisite to the rational design of complex , hierarchical microarchitectures  @xcite .",
    "the experimental set - up is a horizontal hele - shaw cell consisting of two transparent acrylate plates of size 21.5 cm x 21.5 cm x 0.8 cm separated by a gap of 0.5 mm and initially filled with a sodium silicate solution of concentration @xmath49 .",
    "a cobalt chloride solution of concentration @xmath50 is injected into the sodium silicate solution of concentration @xmath49 .",
    "acrylate was chosen instead of glass to avoid interactions between the sodium silicate and the glass . for visualization purposes ,",
    "the cell is placed on top of a diffuse light table and the dynamics is recorded from above using either a cmos camera or a photography camera . some earlier work on chemical gardens employed a similar confined geometry but used seed crystals rather than injection which leads to different dynamics than those studied here  @xcite .",
    "the metallic salt solution is prepared from dissolution in water of crystals of cobalt ( ii ) chloride hexahydrate ( cocl@xmath516h@xmath0o ) ( sigma - aldrich ) .",
    "the sodium silicate solution is prepared from a commercial aqueous solution ( sigma - aldrich ) , with formula na@xmath0(sio@xmath0)@xmath52 @xmath53 h@xmath0o and the composition sio@xmath0",
    "@xmath54 26.5% and na@xmath0o @xmath54 10.6% .",
    "cobalt chloride is one of the classical metallic salts used to grow chemical gardens in 3d : structures form with a smaller induction time and a higher linear growth than with calcium , nickel and manganese salts , for instance  @xcite . in fig.[diagram ] , we used a constant injection rate of 0.11 ml / s , which is larger than those typically used for 3d injection experiments  @xcite and leads to a growth process mainly driven by the flow .",
    "we vary the concentration of sodium silicate within the same range as in 3d experiments  @xcite , from 0.25 to 6.25  m. the cobalt chloride concentration is varied from 0.100 to 1.375  m.    we thank p. borckmans and c.i .",
