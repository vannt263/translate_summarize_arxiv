    "in modern applications , there is need to test for independence between random vectors .",
    "one example from genomics research is whether two groups of genes are associated .",
    "another application is functional magnetic resonance imaging research , where voxels in the brain are measured over time under various experimental conditions , and it is of interest to discover whether sets of voxels that comprise different areas in the brain are functionally related .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be random vectors , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are positive integers .",
    "we are interested in testing whether there is a relationship between the two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the null hypothesis states that the two vectors are independent , @xmath6 where the joint distribution of @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 , and the distributions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , by @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in the general alternative that the vectors are dependent , @xmath13 there are @xmath14 independent copies @xmath15 , @xmath16 from the joint distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for testing @xmath17 . the dimensions of the vectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be much higher than @xmath14 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a powerful test of independence that is applicable in all dimensions , and is consistent against all alternatives .",
    "the test is based on the pairwise distances between the sample values of @xmath4 and of @xmath5 respectively , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the only restriction on the distance metrics @xmath20 and @xmath21 is that they are determined by norms .",
    "the test statistic is a function of ranks of these distances , and it can be expressed simply in closed form .",
    "it is proven to be consistent against all dependent alternatives .",
    "few multivariate tests of independence that are consistent against all alternatives are available to date . @xcite",
    "suggest a test based on normalized cross - covariance operators on reproducing kernel hilbert spaces .",
    "@xcite offer a test based on an approximation of renyi correlation , since there is no explicit formula to compute the renyi correlation .",
    "a very elegant test with a simple formula is provided in @xcite , and has been further investigated in @xcite and in the discussions that followed it .",
    "we revisit some of the examples of @xcite , and add new examples . in the examples considered our new test performs remarkably well in comparison to the test of @xcite .",
    "this section develops the new test of independence . to motivate the test ,",
    "note that if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are dependent and have a continuous joint density , then there exists a point @xmath24 in the sample space of @xmath25 , and radii @xmath26 and @xmath27 around @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , such that the joint distribution of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is different than the product of the marginal distributions in the cartesian product of balls around @xmath30 .",
    "consider first an oracle that guesses such a point @xmath30 and radii @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the norm distance between two sample points , either in @xmath22 or in @xmath23 , so the distance between the vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 from the distribution of @xmath22 is @xmath34 , and similarly the distance between the vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 from the distribution of @xmath23 is @xmath37 .",
    "technically , this distance may be different for the samples of @xmath4 and for the samples of @xmath23 , but we omit this distinction for simplicity of notation .",
    "consider the following two dichotomous random variables : @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the indicator function .",
    "we summarize the observed cross - classification of these two dichotomous random variables for the @xmath14 independent observations @xmath41 in table [ tab - cont1 ] , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 defined similarly , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , are the sum of the row or column , respectively .",
    "@xcite examined the saviotti aircraft data of @xcite , that records six characteristics of aircraft designs during the twentieth century .",
    "they consider two variables , wing span ( m ) and speed ( km / h ) for the 230 designs of the third ( of three ) periods .",
    "this example and the data ( aircraft ) are from @xcite .",
    "they showed that the dcov test of independence of log(speed ) and log(span ) in period 3 is significant ( p - value @xmath48 ) , while the pearson correlation test is not significant ( p - value = 0.8001 ) .",
    "our proposed test is also highly significant ( p - value @xmath49 ) .",
    "moreover , if we take a random sample of 30 observations and apply the dcov test and the proposed test to this small random sample , then we typically get smaller @xmath2-values using our proposed test than using the @xmath50 test .",
    "specifically , repeating the testing of a random sample of 30 observations 100 times , the p - value of our proposed test was below 0.05 for 58/100 simulation runs , whereas for dcov only for 18/100 simulation runs .",
    "figure [ figaircraft ] shows the scatter plot of wing span vs. speed on the log scale for a sample of 30 points .",
    "the relationship appears fan - like . for this particular sample , the @xmath2-value from the @xmath50 test and our proposed test were 0.21 and 0.03 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig ] shows the distribution of the 100 @xmath2-values for each of the tests ."
