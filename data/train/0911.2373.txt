    "the diffeomorphism invariance of einstein s theory of gravity is in an intimate relation with the fact that there is a significant redundancy in the representation of the true physical degrees of freedom .",
    "it can therefore be a great challenge to carry out a faithful investigation of dynamical processes even in case of spherically symmetric spacetimes , in spite of the simplifications offered by the symmetries . correspondingly , the selection of the most appropriate variables , done by applying a suitable gauge fixing , i.e. , the most effective framework to carry out the study of a given dynamical system , is considered to be a sort of art .    in the numerical investigations of spherically symmetric dynamical systems , the method of choptuik  that had been applied first by him in @xcite while exploring the critical phenomenon in the gravitational collapse of various gravity - matter systems  turned to be the most successful in the sense that it is still widely used . however , choptuik s choice has both advantages and disadvantages .",
    "perhaps the most important advantage is that one has to solve only two first order partial differential equations ( pdes ) for the basic metric variables , and @xmath1 in terms of which the spacetime metric can be given as @xmath2 ] which , along with the matter field equations , determine the full evolution of the associated gravity matter system .",
    "on the other hand , the following objections may also be raised .",
    "first of all , the radial coordinate @xmath3 is chosen so that the area @xmath4 of the @xmath5-invariant @xmath6-spheres are given as @xmath7 .",
    "as it is well - known , coordinate systems of this type are not suitable to follow evolution in regions where `` trapped surfaces '' are formed because a coordinate singularity also develops ( for a short discussion see , e.g. , the last paragraph of @xcite ) .",
    "another objection is that one of the first order pdes is hyperbolic while the other is elliptic .",
    "this means that one of the metric equations  which is a constraint equation  has to be integrated on succeeding time level surfaces repeatedly .",
    "this process slows down time integration and makes it hard to apply the powerful tool of adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) which ensures high numerical accuracy in strongly dynamical processes @xcite .",
    "there are two side - remarks in order .",
    "first of all , although it is possible to implement a variant of amr for the numerical integration of mixed hyperbolic and elliptic equations @xcite , the precision is partly lost because the applicability of amr necessitates the extrapolation of some variables in time , something which is better to be avoided in a time integration process .",
    "thereby , the use of a fully hyperbolic system is preferable in case of numerical integration of the field equations based on a finite difference schema .",
    "secondly , it was shown by one of the present authors in @xcite that by making use of the kodama vector field as the time evolutions vector field , the mixed elliptic - hyperbolic system can be replaced by a fully hyperbolic one .",
    "however , we have found the inevitable formation of a coordinate singularity in numerical simulations , the appearance of which was anticipated in the discussion below equation ( 4.15 ) of @xcite .",
    "the above findings motivate the search for a better analytic set - up with a more appropriate choice of the basic variables .    before proceeding and presenting our proposal for such a choice we would like to mention that several attempts have also been made to use reduced versions of the adm and bssn @xcite formalisms in spherical symmetry , see @xcite .",
    "these models have been yielded by the reduction of a more complicated evolutionary system , therefore they do not optimally fit the spherically symmetric setup .",
    "either they apply coordinates that are not suitable to cover regions with trapped surfaces , as it happens , e.g. , in @xcite , or they are simply too complicated  see , e.g. , the basic set of field equations ( 9a)(9f ) and ( 10a)(10c ) in @xcite .",
    "they may also suffer from numerical instabilities at the origin because negative powers of @xmath3 appear in the evolutionary equations .",
    "thereby , it is of considerable interest to single out a simple and general enough framework within which time evolution can be investigated on the largest possible part of the physical spacetime up to the appearance of true geometrical singularities . to match this requirement",
    ", we shall start by choosing a fully hyperbolic evolutionary system that is automatically applicable to describe the evolution in trapped region(s ) .",
    "this choice should be such that the equations are free from the numerical instabilities that used to appear in the origin in spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "an analytic framework fitting the above outlined expectations may be chosen as follows .",
    "based on the results of earlier investigations in spherically symmetric ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and also in generic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) dynamical spacetimes , the metric of the four dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath8 will be assumed to possess the form @xmath9 where the coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 label the points of the two - dimensional timelike surfaces transverse to the transitivity surfaces of the rotation group , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath3 are smooth functions of ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "note that @xmath11 generally differs from the area - radial coordinate .",
    "this condition , as we have already mentioned , is necessary to extend the domain of time evolution to include trapped surfaces  when they exist .    by making use of this geometrical framework , gravitational collapse",
    "have been investigated in some simple gravity - matter systems . in the simplest possible case of asymptotically flat configurations , the associated time evolution of the system",
    "is qualitatively expected @xcite to be as indicated on fig.[coll ] where the event horizon$ ] . ] , and the apparent horizon are also shown . the latter is foliated by marginally trapped surfaces and it is represented by a curve connecting the two ends of the zigzag line depicting the singularity .    a portion of matter either falls into the singularity or reaches future timelike or null infinity , @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the asymptotic structure of the spacetime is expected to approach that of the schwarzschild solution as we get closer to @xmath14 along the null generators of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "if the collapsing matter has no considerable radiative degrees of freedom , the mass of the developing black hole is expected to be close to the total mass on the initial data surface .",
    "note that spherical symmetry makes it possible to define mass and energy inside an invariant metric sphere ( see section[trap ] ) .",
    "if the mass inside the marginally outer trapped surface is found to approach the total mass while moving outwards along the apparent horizon , then we have a strong indication that our spacetime grid covers the truly dynamical part of the collapse .",
    "moreover , as it will be demonstrated in section[dyn ] , the lapse function @xmath13 may always be chosen such that the cauchy surfaces can get arbitrarily close to the singularity .",
    "we were also interested in investigating the time evolution of more exotic initial data specifications . likewise in the standard friedman - robertson - walker cosmological models ",
    "these are known to be spherically symmetric around any of their spacetime events there is a freedom in choosing the topology of the initial data surfaces .",
    "the base manifold @xmath16 of the investigated spacetimes coincides with the future cauchy development of some three - dimensional achronal hypersurface @xmath17 .",
    "thereby , @xmath18 $ ] and it possesses the product space structure @xmath19 @xcite . since the spacetime is spherically symmetric , the @xmath20 time level surfaces ",
    "these are diffeomorphic to @xmath17can also be foliated by the transitivity surfaces of the rotation group . in virtue of the particular form of the applied line element ( [ the_metric.eq ] )",
    "the metric induced on the transitivity surfaces of the rotation group is given as @xmath21 .",
    "thereby , the vanishing of @xmath3 , which is , in fact , the area - radius function , is directly related to the existence of an origin . to see how many origins we might have ,",
    "let us consider some simple choices for the topology of the initial data surface @xmath17 .",
    "whenever @xmath17 is a connected geodesically complete spacelike hypersurface possessing a trivial product bundle structure , its topology is either @xmath22 , @xmath23\\times\\mathbb{s}^2 $ ] , @xmath24 or @xmath25 ( see as an illustration the bottom line of fig.[top ] ) .",
    "accordingly , there may be one origin , two origins or no origin at all on our initial hypersurface .",
    "= 4.3 cm = 4.3 cm = 4.3 cm = 4.3 cm    during time evolution , the geometrical properties of the time level surfaces may change such that new origins are produced , possibly indicating a change in the topology , as illustrated on fig.[top ] .    at this point",
    "it is important to clear up the some of the related notions and potential misconceptions .",
    "while in the above sentences the terminology of topology change have been used , it should be kept in mind that it is the topology of the limit of time level surfaces  comprising the future boundary of the pertinent `` domain of dependence''what may differ from that of the time level surfaces .",
    "a careful approach is needed in applying notions such as _ domain of dependence , cauchy development _ and _ cauchy surface _ which were introduced in @xcite by geroch .",
    "we would like to emphasise first that there is a significant distinction between the notions `` initial data surface '' and `` cauchy surface '' .",
    "we may chose an arbitrary achronal hypersurface @xmath17 as an initial data surface .",
    "the initial data together with the field equations can be used to determine the solution everywhere in the domain of dependence @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "as opposed to this , the use of the notion of `` cauchy surface '' tacitly requires additional knowledge about the global properties of the underlying spacetime .",
    "in particular , see theorem 11 of @xcite , a spacetime is known to be globally hyperbolic if and only if it possesses a cauchy surface .    the confusion might arise  and , in fact , apparently it does arise in many circumstances  in consequence of the fact that the domain of dependence @xmath26 $ ] of any initial data surface @xmath17 , is a globally hyperbolic spacetime itself on its own right , i.e. , @xmath17 is a cauchy surface for @xmath26 $ ] . in many cases",
    "it is obvious to recognise that there exists a globally hyperbolic global extension @xmath27 of @xmath28,g_{ab})$ ] such that the boundary of @xmath26 $ ] is not empty in @xmath29 , while the cauchy horizon , @xmath30=h^+[\\sigma ] \\cup h^-[\\sigma]$ ] of @xmath26 $ ] is obviously empty with respect to @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "however , a generic method that could be applied in all the possible cases does not exist .",
    "although the concept of `` maximal cauchy development '' was introduced in @xcite , it is based on zorn s lemma , which makes its use difficult in practice . as a simple example , consider the maximal analytic extension of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "in kruskal coordinates @xmath31 the line element is given by @xmath32 where the schwarzschild coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath33 are determined by the following implicit relations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath34 by introducing suitable new coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the line element of the schwarzschild spacetime preserves the form ( [ the_metric.eq ] ) .",
    "the time slicings  two of which are indicated on fig.[sch]and the corresponding lapse functions vary accordingly . in the first case ( left panel ) , two points on the @xmath37 hypersurface hit the @xmath38 schwarzschild singularity .",
    "the appearance of these points can be interpreted as the formation of two origins , since @xmath39 in all other points of @xmath37 . correspondingly , the topology @xmath24 of @xmath40 is replaced by the disjoint union of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 at @xmath44 ( see the third column of fig .",
    "[ top ] ) .",
    "it is not hard to modify @xmath40 by inserting suitably located further `` steps '' such that the number of @xmath42 components of the pertinent @xmath45 may take an arbitrary integer value .",
    "although the time level surfaces on the left panel do not cover the future domain of dependence , @xmath46 $ ] , of @xmath40 , it is worthwhile to keep in mind that @xmath40 is a cauchy surface for the schwarzschild spacetime . as it is indicated on the right panel of fig.[sch ] , the entire of @xmath46 $ ] can be covered by time level surfaces if the new coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and in turn , the lapse @xmath13 are chosen properly . there is no topology change and the section of the cauchy surfaces within the black hole region uniformly converge to the @xmath38 singularity . in section[dyn ] , the application of this type of dynamically determined @xmath13 will be demonstrated via various examples .",
    "we would like to mention that the type of topology changes indicated by the left panel of fig.[sch ] showed up in many of our numerical simulations .",
    "we have found that , in consequence of the developing inhomogeneities , certain parts of the time level surfaces may get closer to the singularity much faster than others .",
    "nevertheless , as shown by the above example , the change of the topology refers to the limit of the applied time level surfaces rather than the underlying spacetimes . as it will be demonstrated in the succeeding sections ,",
    "the @xmath13 function can be chosen such that the time evolution is slowed down in spacetime regions close to the singularity .",
    "this way we were able to enlarge the domain of dependences significantly and to get arbitrarily close to the developing spacetime singularities in our simulations .",
    "as a consequence , we were able to investigate the rate of blowing up of the curvature while approaching the singularity .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in section[intr ] , with the help of a simple - minded approach , we demonstrate the main technical issues in solving the einstein - scalar field equations numerically .",
    "these difficulties are resolved in section[intr2 ] , where the misner - sharp mass is introduced as an auxiliary variable to stabilise the applied numerical representation near the origin .",
    "here we also describe the `` trick '' which makes our framework capable to follow the time evolution within the trapped region .",
    "section[stabor ] outlines the analytic procedure that guarantees the required stability of the time evolution in the neighbourhood of an origin . in section[energybal",

    "the results of the convergence and accuracy tests are also presented in this section .",
    "the paper is closed by summarising our results and by providing a short discussions concerning the interpretation and some of the immediate consequences of our findings .",
    "to have a truly dynamical spacetime , some matter fields also have to be specified in addition to the already introduced geometrical framework . for simplicity",
    ", we shall restrict our considerations to a real self - interacting scalar field with lagrangian @xmath47 where the potential possesses the form relevant to the klein - gordon field , @xmath48 with mass parameter @xmath49 .",

    "similarly , the constraint equations are @xmath60 where @xmath61 the number of independent equations is in accordance with the fact that the evolution equation ( [ psi_tautau.eq ] ) for @xmath51 is simply the actual form of ( [ psi.eq ] ) , and that in a generic four - dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime there may only be four independent equations derived from the einstein s equation ( [ einst ] ) . in particular , equations ( [ omega_tautau.0.eq ] ) and ( [ r_tautau.0.eq ] )",

    "we tried to cure this instability in various ways such as extrapolation from outer points , decreasing the order of finite differences near the origin , increasing the numerical dissipation term , and also by using different parametrisations of the metric which were supposed to behave better close to the critical points .",
    "neither of these attempts turned out to be successful .",
    "by the inspection of the term ( [ crashing_term.eq ] ) responsible for the above mentioned instabilities and of the misner - sharp mass @xmath75 @xcite defined by the relation @xmath76 it seems to be rewarding to introduce @xmath75 as an auxiliary variable . by deriving it with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath11 and by using the pertinent form of einstein s equations ( [ einst ] ) to eliminate the second derivatives of @xmath3 , an evolution and a constraint equation can be deduced : @xmath77 what makes the introduction of @xmath75 even more preferable is related to the following observations .",

    "the algebraic sub - determinant of this system is @xmath84 , which will be shown in section [ trap ] to vanish only at isolated marginally trapped surfaces .",

    "note that the introduction of @xmath75 makes the use of ( [ omega_tautau.2.eq ] ) superfluous since @xmath12 can be determined from ( [ m.def.eq ] ) once the fields @xmath75 and @xmath3 are known , however , this way we get a 0/0 type formula for @xmath59 at ` marginally trapped surfaces ' ( for their precise definition see section[trap ] ) and an instability in the numerical simulation , thereby making it impossible to study the evolution inside the black hole region . in order to overcome these difficulties",

    "as one of our aims was to clear up some conceptual issues of topology change , let us close this paper by related comments .    in dealing with the problem of topology changes , one should start by recalling the result of geroch @xcite which asserts that if topology change develops then there must exist either closed causal curves beyond the cauchy horizon or a spacetime singularity has to appear . due to tipler s theorem @xcite",
    ", the latter case manifests itself if einstein s equations are imposed .",
    "based on these results , it has been widely held that no indication of topology changes will ever show up in classical general relativity , therefore the quantum theory should be investigated to see whether they may occur .",
    "the idea that the topology may change in quantum gravity was originally proposed by wheeler @xcite . since then , one of the most important questions in any quantum theory of gravity is whether there is a non - zero probability for the topology of space to change .",
    "there have been a number of classical investigations aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of topology change by making use of the techniques of differential geometry and topology ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , no quantitative investigations have been carried out yet .",
    "therefore it is important to emphasise that some of our findings provide the first definite quantitative support to all the former speculations concerning the existence of topology changes .",
    "in summarising our pertinent observations , we can say , in accordance with the above recalled results of geroch and tipler , that instead of having a regular cauchy horizon , along with a causality violating region beyond , a spacetime singularity develops at the `` new origins '' .",
    "it was also found that the kretschmann scalar always blows up there .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the einstein - hilbert action @xmath335 was found to be bounded in all of our investigations",
    ".    the existence of time developments with apparent topology changes may be significant in quantum theoretical considerations .",
    "for instance , in the sum over histories approach to quantum gravity , the transition amplitude for the topology change between the two riemannian manifolds @xmath336 and @xmath337 is supposed to be given by the formula @xmath338 \\,\\mathcal{d}g_{ab}\\ , , \\ ] ] where the boundary of @xmath16 is the disjoint union of @xmath339 and @xmath340 , @xmath341 denote the einstein - hilbert action and @xmath342 is the space of @xmath0-dimensional lorentzian geometries on @xmath16 , while the sum is over all @xmath0-manifolds whose boundary is the disjoint union of @xmath339 and @xmath340 with riemannian metrics @xmath343 and @xmath344 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    admittedly , the right hand side of ( [ fint ] ) is completely formal and is far from being defined as yet .",
    "nevertheless , regardless of the specific form of the measure on the space of metrics , @xmath345 , it is widely held that not only the smooth lorentzian metrics but all the metrics with finite einstein - hilbert action should be taken into account in evaluating the functional integral .",
    "therefore the spacetimes with topology changes investigated in this paper , might be of interest in quantum theoretical considerations .",
    "it is of obvious importance to know whether the methods introduced in this paper could be adopted in more generic geometrical setup allowing the presence of gravitational waves and with the inclusion of binary black holes .",
    "we would like to mention that by making use of the analytic setup suggested in @xcite such a generalisation seems to be possible .",
    "the results of our corresponding investigations will be published elsewhere .",
    "this research was supported in part by otka grant k67942 ."
