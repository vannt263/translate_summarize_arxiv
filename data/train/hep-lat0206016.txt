    "we discuss the fermilab approach to heavy quarks on the lattices @xcite , and explain how we adapt it to wilson and nonperturbatively improved @xcite clover quarks .",
    "we also explain our use of perturbative renormalization and the choice of scale ( `` @xmath18 '' ) .",
    "section [ sec : details ] gives the lattice computational details .",
    "we discuss the generation of configurations , the evaluation of quark propagators for wilson , clover , and static quarks , and various aspects of the analysis , including fitting and extrapolation .",
    "the most significant open issue here involves the effect of chiral logarithms on the light quark mass extrapolations .",
    "in important recent work , kronfeld and ryan @xcite and yamada @xcite ( building on work of the jlqcd collaboration @xcite ) have argued that standard linear or quadratic extrapolations from typical lattice light quark masses miss the logarithms at low mass and drastically underestimate such quantities as .",

    "[ sec : quenched ] we revisit the quenched approximation .",
    "the dominant source of systematic error in our previous quenched computation @xcite was the continuum extrapolation .",
    "two new features of the current analysis have significantly reduced that error : ( 1 ) new running with both wilson and clover quarks and ( 2 ) a new central value for the scale @xmath18 for the heavy - light axial current @xcite .",

    "finally we clarify the effects of `` fat - link '' fermions using some new test runs in the quenched case .",
    "these shed light on why the preliminary values for heavy - light decay constants with fat - link fermions on dynamical configurations were anomalously low @xcite .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we describe work in progress that addresses the outstanding issues in the chiral and continuum extrapolations .",
    "the computation presented in this paper is rather complicated : we use several different actions , operators , renormalizations , fitting techniques , and extrapolations .",
    "part of the reason for this is that the simulations with dynamical quarks are extremely demanding computationally and therefore have taken years to complete . during that time , as our understanding of the physics and analysis issues grew , our methods evolved .",
    "the variety of methods used does have one important virtue : it allows us to estimate many of the systematic effects in a direct way .",

    "@xcite sets to zero certain parts of the lattice integrand whose contributions to the matching vanish by contour integration .",

    "secondly , there are `` constant '' terms in the matching coming from the dimensionally regularized continuum integrals . hernandez and hill",
    "treat these as constant over the 4-dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "similarly , the @xmath86 ) term in @xmath76 , which comes from both continuum and lattice integrals , is set to zero in @xcite by the choice @xmath87 .",
    "in contrast , ref .",
    "@xcite keeps the full continuum integrands as well as the full lattice integrands .",
    "this does introduce a small amount of arbitrariness : the dimensionally regulated continuum integrals must be replaced by finite , subtracted 4-dimensional integrals , and there is some freedom in how the subtraction is done . however , as long as the subtraction is `` reasonable , '' the arbitrariness in @xmath18 is small .",
    "if we accept the results of ref .",

    "secondly , our approach relies on  to find the quantities @xmath193 and @xmath194 , and  is not necessarily rapidly convergent for @xmath195 quarks . we have also performed only a partially quenched analysis of this issue . because of the size of the errors , we have not attempted to extrapolate the dynamical quarks to their physical masses .",
    "finally , we note that there is an inherent ( though presumably small ) inconsistency in our determinations of @xmath196 and @xmath197 , which indirectly use the physical values of @xmath82 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 ( or @xmath201 or @xmath202 ) .",
    "we can not force all these quantities to have their physical values at once in a theory without a dynamical strange quark .",
    "for this reason , it is unclear for example whether it is better to use @xmath0 or @xmath203 pq  in finding @xmath194 ; we hope that our range of methods gives a reasonable range of results . given the crude nature of the chiral log error , we believe that it would be inappropriate at this stage to use the computations described in sec .  [",
    "sec : chiral - logs ] to correct our central values . instead",
    ", we use them only for error estimates .      the magnetic mass error in tables  [ tab : decay - syst - dynam ] and [ tab : ratio - syst - dynam ] is estimated with almost the same method as we used for the quenched calculation .",
    "the only difference is that here all the valence quarks are of wilson type , so that there is no reduction of the magnetic mass error in the final error budget for the relative number of wilson and clover estimates .",
    "the perturbative and @xmath204 fit errors in the tables are determined in exactly the same manner as in the quenched approximation .",
    "the errors due to finite volume are studied by comparing results on sets r and g , both of which have @xmath205 and @xmath206 , but which have spatial volumes @xmath207 and @xmath208 , respectively .",
    "note that all but one of our @xmath0 sets are large ( spatial size @xmath209@xmath210  fm ) ; only set g is comparable in size ( @xmath211  fm ) to the quenched lattices .",
    "the difference between sets r and g is therefore likely to be a considerable overestimate of the actual finite volume error . despite this , the differences are almost never statistically significant . here",
    "a `` significant difference '' is defined as one that is larger than the sum , in quadrature , of the statistical errors of the two sets .",
    "when the difference is insignificant , we set the finite volume error to zero , as indicated in tables  [ tab : decay - syst - dynam ] and [ tab : ratio - syst - dynam ] by the notation `` @xmath212 . ''",
    "the only case where we find a significant ( @xmath213 ) effect is in .",
    "the total systematic error _ within _ the current approximation ( partially quenched @xmath0 theory )",
    "is then taken to be the sum of all the systematic errors above the line in tables  [ tab : decay - syst - dynam ] and [ tab : ratio - syst - dynam ] : continuum extrapolation , valence chiral extrapolation , perturbative , magnetic mass , @xmath204 fit , and finite volume errors .",
    "since these errors show no evidence of correlations , we perform the sum in quadrature .",
    "we do , however , treat positive and negative errors separately , since the valence chiral extrapolation error represents a binary choice and has a well determined sign .",
    "we still need to estimate the error _ of _ the partially quenched @xmath0 approximation .",
    "one measure of this error has already been discussed : the partial quenching error .",
    "the effect of the missing third light virtual quark ( the @xmath195 quark ) is estimated in a direct way by assuming a simple linear dependence of the decay constants on the number of dynamical flavors . the error is thus chosen to be one half the difference of the @xmath0 and quenched calculations .",
    "this estimate is labeled `` missing dynamical @xmath195 quark '' in tables  [ tab : decay - syst - dynam ] and [ tab : ratio - syst - dynam ] .",
    "we also estimate the effect in two indirect ways : by determining the change in the results when ( 1 ) the scale is fixed by @xmath214 ( instead of @xmath82 ) , and ( 2 ) for strange quark quantities , when @xmath196 is fixed by the vector meson sector ( @xmath202 ) instead of the pseudoscalars . in full qcd ( and with no other systematic errors ! ) , these differences should vanish , so their size is an estimate of the distance we are from the full theory .",
    "the total error of the partially quenched @xmath0 approximation is then defined to be the maximum of the four estimates below the line in tables  [ tab : decay - syst - dynam ] and [ tab : ratio - syst - dynam ] : partial quenching , scale , @xmath196 , and missing dynamical @xmath195 quark .",
    "the latter three estimates have a well - determined sign , and we therefore find the maximum positive and maximum negative error separately .",
    "( as discussed above the partial quenching error is treated symmetrically . ) for the individual decay constants , the scale and missing dynamical @xmath195 quark estimates are always largest ; while the error in the ratios are almost always dominated by the partially quenched error .",
    "finally we include an additional error due to the fact that our extrapolations from rather large light quark masses can not see the chiral logarithms directly .",
    "this error is estimated in sec .",
    "[ sec : chiral - log - errors ] .",
    "we emphasize that it is necessarily crude .",
    "our final results for heavy - light decay constants , including the effects of dynamical quarks , are : @xmath215 here the errors are , respectively , statistical , systematic within the @xmath191 partially quenched approximation , the systematic errors of that approximation ( due to partial quenching and the missing virtual strange quark ) , and an estimate of the effect of chiral logarithms .",
    "the result for @xmath216 is consistent with experimental results ; ref .",
    "@xcite obtains @xmath217 , which the _ review of particle properties _ cites as `` the best and most recent value '' @xcite .",
    "our @xmath0 values are consistent with recent results of cp - pacs @xcite and preliminary results of jlqcd @xcite , though our central values of the decay constants and ratios  and  are somewhat lower than those of cp - pacs .",
    "equation [ eq : fbdynam ] and tables  [ tab : decay - syst - dynam ] , [ tab : ratio - syst - dynam ] , [ tab : decay - logs ] and [ tab : ratio - logs ] summarize our results .",
    "chiral extrapolation , continuum extrapolation and perturbation theory are generally the biggest sources of errors for the decay constants , while partially quenching , the missing @xmath195 quark , and the magnetic mass are also important for many of the ratios . because the lattice @xmath7 have necessarily been rather heavy , as they have in other lattice calculations to date , the effects of chiral logarithms at low quark mass have only been investigated crudely and indirectly .",
    "we believe that is the error on which we have least control at present .",
    "work in progress @xcite addresses many of the above issues .",
    "improved actions have decreased the continuum extrapolation errors significantly , as well as eliminated the separate magnetic mass error .",
    "a dynamical @xmath195 quark is now explicitly included .",
    "further , since the new computations use a wide range of both dynamical and light valence quark masses we hope to treat the chiral logarithms explicitly within a partially quenched framework @xcite",
    ". this should provide more direct evidence about the issue about the size of chiral logarithm effects @xcite , as well as eliminate the explicit partial quenching error .",
    "future calculations will use staggered light quarks , as has already been investigated in conjunction with nrqcd heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "this will allow for very light valence masses and therefore make possible a detailed study of chiral logarithms . to improve the chiral extrapolations still more , one - loop chiral perturbation theory calculations that take into account staggered taste violation will be needed .",
    "such calculations for pseudoscalar meson masses already exist ; those for heavy - light decay constants are in progress @xcite .",
    "the next step after that is likely to involve perturbation theory .",
    "once the other errors have been reduced , the errors of one - loop perturbative calculations will no longer be acceptable .",
    "higher order calculations using automated methods @xcite or non - perturbative computations will be required .",
