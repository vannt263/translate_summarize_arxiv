    "the change of the peierls transition temperature in systems with reduced dimensionality , like the organic charge transfer complex tetrathiafulvalene - tetracyanoquinodimethane ( ttf - tcnq ) , with regard to biaxial strain and disorder in the material was not previously studied due to some experimental difficulties .",
    "ttf - tcnq is a quasi - one - dimensional organic metal which experiences a series of phase transitions at @xmath0  k , @xmath1  k and @xmath2  k @xcite , leading to a suppression of the metallic conductivity of the ttf and tcnq chains and turning the material into a perfect insulator . the phase transition at 54  k is driven by a charge density wave ( cdw ) peierls instability in the tcnq chains @xcite .",

    "there are several aspects regarding the electronic properties of this material which can be studied in thin films that are not accessible in single crystals , such as substrate - induced strain and the effect of disorder caused by electron beam irradiation .",

    "is advantageous for several reasons , one of which is the possibility to deposit locally large doses ( reaching into the ggy regime ) with very high lateral resolution and control within a scanning electron microscope .",
    "primary electron energies of several kev at a flux density of 250  as / m@xmath6 have been employed . due to the limited penetration depth of the electrons of about 400  nm at 5",

    "it is possible to grow epitaxial , @xmath7-axis oriented thin films of ttf - tcnq on alkali - halide substrates @xcite .",
    "however , the epitaxy is of the two - domain type which inevitably leads to two complications .",
    "first , low - lying charge excitations originating from domain or grain boundaries will contribute to the measured transport properties .",
    "considering the typical domain size for ttf - tcnq , which is typically below 3  @xmath8 m , this can only be avoided by high - resolution lithographic techniques .",
    "however , resist - based photo or electron - beam lithography is not readily applicable to organic charge transfer materials .",
    "second , if the transport data are taken over multiple domains , a mixture ensues ( series and parallel circuiting ) of the contributions along the highly - conducting @xmath3-axis and the much less conducting @xmath9-axis .",
    "this renders data analysis much more complicated .    in this work we present and analyze temperature - dependent conductivity measurements and current - voltage characteristics taken on individual ttf - tcnq domains with a typical size of 2.5  @xmath8 m by 250  nm .",

    "we argue that the data below 50 k can be explained in the framework of the segmented metal - rod model of fogler , teber and shklovskii developed for a quasi one - dimensional electron crystal @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the low - lying charge excitations above 50 k are mainly due to fluctuating charge density waves ( cdw ) which are subject to the same segmentation as assumed in the fogler , teber and shklovskii model , albeit here an additional length scale enters , namely the average cdw - fluctuation correlation length .",

    "also , the observed crossover of transport regimes stemming from the change of the vrh exponent @xmath28 at temperatures of about 50  k for the measured ttf - tcnq domains is ascribed to the presence of the slightly suppressed peierls transition in the system which is assumed to persist despite of the increased defect concentration .    290  k. the irradiation dose for the microcrystal was 2.4  ggy.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in order to get more information about cdw contributions below @xmath5 ( within the fts scenario ) and above @xmath5 ( via cdw fluctuations ) we performed current - voltage @xmath51 measurements and analyzed possible threshold behavior .",

    "this increase of the threshold electric field is thought to be caused by two effects : ( i ) the relatively high concentration of defects in the domains @xcite , and ( ii ) the finite size of the sample , which has a severe influence on the threshold electric field in one - dimensional conductors as discussed in @xcite .",

    "if this cdw fluctuation components persist despite of the large defect density , it would arguably be subjected to the same segmentation of the chains as assumed in the fts - model @xcite , albeit here an additional length scale enters , namely the average cdw - fluctuation correlation length .    as final point in our analysis we address an additional aspect which may be of relevance in developing a comprehensive understanding of the presented data . in @xcite",

    "it was shown that by introducing either compressive or tensile strain the superconducting ground state of the material can be dramatically changed from superconducting to insulating .",
    "thus , substrate - induced effects need also to be taken into account here . in our study",
    "we consider microscale ttf - tcnq crystals deposited on top of a si(100)/sio@xmath14 substrate .",
    "the si / sio@xmath14 substrate has negligibly small thermal contraction @xcite when compared to the thermal contraction of ttf - tcnq @xcite . due to the difference of the thermal expansion properties of the substrate and the charge transfer complex a tensile biaxial strain",
    "is produced when the sample is cooled down .",
    "this does , of course , imply the assumption that the ttf - tcnq microcrystal are fully clamped .",
    "a direct proof of clamping , as can in principle be provided by temperature - dependent x - ray diffraction experiments , is not feasible for individual microcrystals .",
    "however , due to the very small thickness of the microcrystals and in view of our results obtained of thin films @xcite , a clamped state is highly likely .",
    "a simple estimate @xcite of this strain along the @xmath9 and @xmath3-axes of the ttf - tcnq domain , with thermal expansion coefficients taken from @xcite and elastic module from @xcite at @xmath55  k , predicts the tensile strain and stress along the @xmath9-axis to be @xmath56 and @xmath570.4  gpa , and along the @xmath3-axis to be @xmath58 and @xmath591.3  gpa .",
    "ttf - tcnq single crystals compressed by hydrostatic pressure of the same order of magnitude as calculated above experience a slight shift of the peierls transition temperature of about @xmath60  k @xcite .",
    "it is not proper to naively compare the possible effects of biaxial strain with results for hydrostatic pressure quantitatively .",
    "however , it may provide a qualitative idea about the range of changes of the peierls transition temperature in the case of the biaxial strain as is expected to occur in the ttf - tcnq microcrystals . the thermal tensile strain caused by",
    "the substrate - induced interaction decreases the overlap of the electronic wave function in ttf - tcnq along the stack direction and one might rather expect an increase of the peierls transition temperature .",
    "however , to our knowledge the influence of a biaxial strain on the peierls transition temperature has not been studied by theoretical means so far .",
    "we are left with the qualitative statement that the strain effect is most likely not significant against the background of the change of the phase transition due to the induced defects .",
    "the peierls transition temperature in ttf - tcnq domains irradiated with electrons is attributed to the point where the exponent in the variable range hopping behavior changes , i.e. at about 50  k. due to the interplay of the impact from the defects ( decrease of @xmath5 ) and from the biaxial strain ( possible increase of @xmath5 ) we are not able to separate both effects in the present case .",
    "in this paper the charge carrier dynamics in individual ttf - tcnq domains fabricated by physical vapor deposition is discussed .",
    "the domain represents a system in which thin film specific aspects like substrate - induced strain , size effects and disorder - induced changes in the electronic structure are combined .",
    "the results on ttf - tcnq domains are compared with data obtained on epitaxial , as - grown ttf - tcnq films of the two - domain type .",

    "the manifestation of the peierls phase transition in the ttf - tcnq domains is smeared out in the resistivity - temperature dependence .",
    "the relatively high defect concentration results in a variable range hopping behavior of the resistivity instead of commonly observed metallic or thermo - activated one .",

    "the influence of the substrate on the grown domains is appreciable .",
    "the development of tensile strain in the domain under cooling may lead to an increase of the peierls transition temperature .",
    "in contrast to this , the change of the peierls transition temperature due to the developed biaxial strain is hindered by the impact from defects , which lead to a reduction of the phase transition temperature .",
    "for the individual domains variable range hopping behavior of a different kind above and below a temperature of about 50  k , corresponding to a slightly suppressed peierls transition temperature , was observed .",
    "the data below 50  k can be explained in the framework of the segmented metal - rod model of fogler , teber and shklovskii developed for a quasi - one - dimensional electron crystal @xcite .",
    "the observed threshold voltage for ttf - tcnq domains is assumed to correspond to depinning of the charge density wave below @xmath5 , which persists as a fluctuating contribution at temperature above @xmath5 despite the relatively large defect concentration .",
    "the approach followed in this work provides a new pathway to the isolation of individual ttf - tcnq ( or other organic charge transfer ) domains for studying size effects and clamping .",
    "the electron beam induced effects are very useful for studying the influence of irradiation induced defects .",
    "the combination of all of these aspects leads to additional complexities which cause us to conclude that ( i ) the combined action of finite size effects and disorder causes a crossover from arrhenius - like to variable range hopping transport in ttf - tcnq , ( ii ) the influence of biaxial strain has to be disentangled from the finite size and irradiation effects . it would be desirable to optimize the domain contact fabrication such that it can be performed without excessive defect formation .",
