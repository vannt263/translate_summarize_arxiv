    "self - assembly of strain - induced islands in hetero - epitaxial systems is a promising route to use nanoscale structures as quantum dots in opto - electronic devices . among the different strained material combinations investigated so far , the ge / si system is often considered as a prototype for understanding fundamental properties of heteroepitaxial growth . in general",
    ", ge prefers to adsorb on the surface , since the ge dangling - bond energy is lower than that of si @xcite .",
    "however , theoretically , it is expected that the tensile stress induced due to reconstruction makes ge atoms diffuse into the silicon subsurface and into the bulk @xcite .",
    "hence , evolution of crystallographic facets of strained ge - si structures and diffusion of ge into the si substrate depend on the kind of the substrate and nature of reconstructions@xcite .",
    "faceting is a fundamental concern in the crystal growth process .",
    "it is observed when the system is allowed to minimize its free energy ( thermodynamic equilibrium)@xcite.the faceting phenomenon not only depends on material properties but also on the sample configurations and process conditions ( pressure , growth temperature , composition , etc . ) .",
    "faceting can be used in order to improve electrical performance as in folded devices or minimized and suppressed as in silicon on nothing ( son ) technology @xcite .",
    "the growth of ge nanostructures on low index silicon surfaces has been studied by many groups@xcite in the last two decades .",
    "more recently , the study of self - organization in ge / si system has been extended to high - index surfaces@xcite .",
    "however , the kinetic and thermodynamic factors determining the shape of the self - assembled ge - si structures are not yet well studied .",
    "a high index surface is misoriented from the low index plane by a small vicinal angle , relative to low index surfaces .",
    "the ultra - clean reconstructed surface shows periodic steps and terraces .",
    "the anisotropic surface reconstruction on high - index silicon surfaces makes them potentially significant substrates for the growth of ordered nanostructures .",
    "the use of such matrices as templates can enhance the formation of aligned nanostructures with self - assembled growth , which is not so easily achievable with lithography tools .",
    "due to its natural process and damage - free features , structural self - organization on high index surfaces has received much attention in the formation of coherent 1d and 2d semiconductor / metal nanostructures .",
    "high index surfaces are found to have reconstructions into regular hill ( step ) and valley ( terrace ) structures with periods ranging from several nanometers to about one hundred nanometers .",
    "the periodicity of such structures depends mainly on the substrate orientation and miscut or vicinal angles .",
    "the width of the terraces and step height can easily be modulated with temperature and coverage .",
    "these anisotropic silicon surfaces having alternating terraces and atomic steps can be used to form aligned one dimensional nanostructures@xcite . among the high index silicon surfaces oriented between ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) , si(5 5 12 ) exhibits relatively stable reconstruction having 1d symmetry with a ( @xmath4 ) mirror plane .",
    "the si(5 5 12 ) surface is oriented 30.5@xmath0 away from ( 001 ) towards ( 111 ) and offers a stable 2@xmath51 surface reconstruction with one - dimensional periodicity over a large unit cell@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the morphological evolution of strained ge - si islands on high index si(5 5 12 ) surfaces as a function of growth temperature and mode of heating the substrate .",
    "we show the transformation of irregular shaped ge - si island to faceted dome structures and well aligned trapezoidal structure after an optimum critical temperature depending upon the modes of heating the substrate .",
    "the experiments discussed in the following were performed in an mbe chamber under ultra - high vacuum(uhv ) , at a base pressure of @xmath6 mbar .",
    "si(5 5 12 ) of size 8@xmath53 ( mm)@xmath7 were prepared through cutting from commercially available p - type boron doped wafers ( of resistivity of 10 - 15 @xmath8 cm ) .",
    "substrates were degassed at 600@xmath9c for about 12 hours followed by repeated flashing ( with direct current heating ) for 30 sec . at a temperature of 1250@xmath9c to remove the native oxide layer to obtain a clean and well - reconstructed surface .",
    "the reconstruction has been confirmed with in - situ reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) .",
    "the temperature was monitored with an infra - red pyrometer calibrated with a thermocouple attached to the sample holder .",
    "two series of samples have been prepared .",
    "10 ml ge deposition on si(5 5 12 ) from rt to 800@xmath9c , with two modes of heating , namely , ( i ) heating is achieved through a filament underneath ( radiative heating : rh ) .",
    "( ii ) heating achieved by passing a direct current ( dc ) through the sample .",
    "the post - growth characterization of the samples was carried out ex situ by field emission gun based scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) , transmission electron microscope(tem ) and mev ion scattering ( rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) ) . to compare with growth on a high index surface",
    ", we also carried out 10 ml thick ge growth on a si(111 ) substrate with a resistivity of 0.5 - 30 @xmath8 cm .",
