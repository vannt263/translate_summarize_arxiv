    "with the first measurements of the direct cp asymmetry in the @xmath6-meson system by the babar and belle collaborations , charmless two - body hadronic @xmath6 decays have become particularly interesting for constraining the ckm matrix elements . in particular",
    ", @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays can be used to extract the angle @xmath9 .",
    "there are several strategies used to determine the @xmath10 angle from such decays , mainly based on the isospin and su(3 ) relations .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical accuracy of these relations is limited and it has to be improved by calculating the su(3 ) breaking effects @xcite . in the direct calculation of the relevant hadronic matrix elements one has also to resort to approximate methods .",
    "apart from the naive factorization , which assumes the vanishing nonfactorizable interactions , there are methods which try to investigate the latter @xcite .",
    "qcd factorization approach @xcite shows that in the @xmath11 limit , exclusive @xmath6-decay amplitudes can be expressed in terms of the factorizable part and calculable @xmath4 nonfactorizable corrections . for phenomenological applications it is important to investigate the subleading effects in the decay amplitudes suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath3 .",
    "especially interesting are `` soft '' nonfactorizable effects , involving low - virtuality gluons and quarks , not necessarily accompanied by an @xmath12-suppression .",
    "quantitative estimates of nonfactorizable contributions , including the power - suppressed @xmath2 contributions can be obtained @xcite using the method of qcd light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) .    among the most intriguing effects in charmless @xmath6 decays",
    "are the so called `` charming penguins '' .",
    "the @xmath1-quark pair emitted in the @xmath13 decay propagates in the environment of the light spectator cloud and annihilates to gluons , the latter being absorbed in the final charmless state . in this , so called bss - mechanism @xcite the intermediate @xmath14 loop generates an imaginary part , contributing to the final - state strong rescattering phase . in qcd factorization approach @xcite ,",
    "charming penguins are typically small , being a part of the @xmath4 nonfactorizable correction to the @xmath15 amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "fits of two - body charmless @xmath6 decays do not exclude substantial @xmath2 nonperturbative effects of the charming - penguin type @xcite .",
    "therefore , in @xcite we have investigated the effects generated by @xmath1-quark loops in charmless @xmath6 decays by using lcsr .",
    "the decay amplitude for the @xmath16 decay is given by the hadronic matrix element @xmath17 of the effective weak hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the current - current operators ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 are the penguin operators , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the electric dipole and chromomagnetic dipole operator , respectively .",
    "each operator entering eq .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) contributes to the @xmath15 decay amplitude with a number of different contractions of the quark lines ( topologies ) . in the discussion we will mainly concentrate on the operator @xmath26 . for convenience",
    "we decompose this operator as @xmath27 , extracting the color - octet part @xmath28    the lcsr expression for the @xmath15 hadronic matrix element of @xmath29 is derived from the procedure described in detail in @xcite .",
    "one starts by introducing the correlation function : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the quark currents interpolating pion and @xmath6 meson , respectively .",
    "only the color - octet part of the @xmath33 operator contributes at the leading order .",
    "the contributions of @xmath34 have to be considered within higher - order corrections .",
    "the lcsr expression for the hadronic matrix element @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the borel parameters in the pion and @xmath6-meson channels , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 @xmath40 is the effective threshold parameter of the perturbative continuum in the pion ( @xmath6-meson ) channel . in the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) we take the finite @xmath3 corrections into account , but neglect numerically very small corrections of order @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding sum rule for the hadronic matrix elements of the current - current operator with the light quarks @xmath42 , @xmath43 is easily obtained from lcsr for the @xmath44 operator by putting consistently @xmath45 .",
    "we calculate @xmath46 in ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) at large spacelike @xmath47 employing the operator product expansion ( ope ) near the light - cone .",
    "the corresponding diagrams of @xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hard ] .",
    "they contain a @xmath1-quark loop , which involves a well known function , producing the perturbative imaginary part , due to the bss mechanism @xcite .",
    "the remaining diagrams not shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : hard ] , with gluons attached to the virtual @xmath48 and @xmath49 lines , do not contribute to the sum rule because their double imaginary parts vanish inside the duality regions @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "to    we proceed by investigating the effect of the soft ( low - virtuality ) gluons coupled to the @xmath1-quark loop . on -",
    "shell gluons or light quarks emitted at short distances end up in the multiparticle distribution amplitudes ( da s ) of the pion .",
    "these contributions are then of the higher twist and are suppressed by inverse powers of the heavy mass scale with respect to the contributions of 2-particle quark - antiquark da s of lower twists . therefore , for our purposes it is sufficient to consider diagrams with one `` constituent '' gluon i.e. , diagrams involving quark - antiquark - gluon da s of the pion . however , for the given correlation function ( [ eq : corr0 ] ) , the diagram ( fig .",
    "2a ) with one gluon vanishes due to the current conservation in the @xmath1-quark loop .    to ( a ) ( b )    nonvanishing terms with the three - particle da s emerge from the diagrams , containing at least one hard gluon in addition to the on - shell gluon , fig.2b . from the studies of the @xmath52 matrix elements of @xmath53 , where similar diagrams with an on - shell photon and virtual gluon have been calculated @xcite ,",
    "it could be concluded that the contribution of such diagrams is both , @xmath12 and @xmath54 suppressed with respect to the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : hard ] .",
    "furthermore , from the simple dimension counting we find that another possible contribution , shown in the diagram fig.3a is suppressed by a factor of @xmath55 .",
    "to ( a ) ( b )    also , the diagram with two gluons emitted from the @xmath1-quark loop ( fig .",
    "3b ) is not included in our calculation because it contains da s with multiplicity larger than three and it is suppressed with respect to the diagrams in fig .  [",
    "fig : hard ] by at least @xmath56 .",
    "the presence of @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the contributions of fig.[fig:4q]a and fig.[fig:4q]b respectively , indicates that at @xmath45 these terms are divergent and by calculating the contribution of @xmath59 from such diagrams one will have to consider propagation of the light - quark pair at long distances , i.e. the pion four - quark da diagram @xcite .",
    "the contributions of four - quark da s stemming from the matrix elements of the type @xmath60 ( @xmath61 on the light - cone ) are neglected .",
    "but , following @xcite we take into account the factorizable parts of the 4-quark vacuum - pion matrix elements , extracting the configurations where one quark - antiquark pair forms the quark vacuum condensate , whereas the other one hadronizes into a twist 2 and 3 pion da .",
    "such contributions are enhanced by the large parameter @xmath62 . in the approximation adopted in @xcite , only two diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond ] contribute to the sum rule .",
    "note that the quark - condensate diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond]b originates from the 4-quark diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:4q]a .",
    "multiparticle contributions which are factorized in the condensates of higher dimension are not taken into account .",
    "we also neglect the quark - condensate contributions of the type @xmath63 arising from the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:4q]b after applying the qcd equation of motion to the derivatives of @xmath64 .",
    "these terms are suppressed at least by @xmath65 with respect to the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond ] .    to summarize",
    ", we do not find significant contributions involving soft gluons in the ope of the correlation function ( [ eq : corr0 ] ) .",
    "the dominant effect which we calculate arises from the @xmath1-quark loop annihilation into hard gluons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hard ] ) .",
    "in addition , there is the quark - condensate contribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cond ] ) which we consider as a natural upper limit for all neglected contributions of multiparticle da s .",
    "to ( a ) ( b )",
    "for a numerical estimate of the charming penguin in @xmath15 decay we calculate the ratio of the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) to the factorizable amplitude @xmath66 : @xmath67 with the parameters taken from @xcite , and by adding linearly the uncertainties caused by the variation of all parameters , we get the following for the penguin - loop contractions with @xmath1 and @xmath68 quarks in the loop : @xmath69\\cdot 10^{-2}\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ & & r^{({\\cal o}_1^u)}(\\bar{b}^0_d\\to \\pi^+\\pi^- ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{0.21 cm } =   [ ( 0.09\\div 0.21 ) -(1.6\\pm 2.1)i]\\cdot 10^{-2}\\ , , \\label{eq : numberc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the charming penguin corrections turn out to be very small , not larger than the other nonfactorizable corrections . however , they appear to produce a noticeable effect in the cp asymmetry",
    ". therefore , the cp asymmetry appears also to be a good testing ground for the influence of the @xmath70 corrections in the charming penguin contributions .",
    "penguin contributions influence both the direct and the mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath71 . here",
    "we concentrate on the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath72 decay , which is given as @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath76 is the contribution to the @xmath15 amplitude proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "it contains the tree amplitude , the penguin - loop contractions of the current - current operators @xmath78 , and also @xmath79 proportional penguin operator contractions . the remaining contributions , being proportional to @xmath80 are contained in @xmath81 .",
    "the penguin - loop contractions of the current - current operators @xmath82 represent the main contribution to this part .",
    "the factor @xmath83 is the ratio of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "both @xmath76 and @xmath81 amplitudes have strong phases ; therefore we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 and the cp asymmetry for @xmath86 can be written as @xmath87 we have to include in @xmath76 and @xmath81 all contributions mentioned above .",
    "the contributions arising from the penguin contractions of the operators @xmath33 and @xmath88 are taken as in ( [ eq : numberc ] ) .",
    "it is easy to extend these results to the tree and penguin contributions of the penguin operators @xmath89 .",
    "the lcsr result for the gluonic penguin contribution of the dipole operator @xmath25 is borrowed from @xcite .",
    "the electroweak penguin contributions to @xmath71 are color - suppressed and negligible .",
    "the hard @xmath4 corrections to @xmath76 and @xmath81 amplitudes are known in @xmath90 limit from qcd factorization @xcite .",
    "we have examined the influence of these contributions on the phases @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it appeared that they are highly suppressed in comparison to the phases emerging from the penguin - loop contributions .",
    "therefore , we neglect @xmath4 corrections in ( [ eq : acp ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] we show @xmath93 as a function of @xmath10 , calculated by using the penguin contributions estimated from lcsr at finite @xmath3 ( dark region ) and compare the result to the infinite - mass limit that agrees with the qcd factorization prediction @xcite ( upper curve ) .",
    "both results are taken at the same scale @xmath94 as used in lcsr .",
    "to    the prediction shown in the figure is not final , because there are missing annihilation effects , and the uncertainty in the ckm matrix elements are also not taken into account .",
    "however , the figure nicely illustrates the size of @xmath2 corrections and the difference between the result at the finite @xmath3 and the @xmath95 result .",
    "the lcsr estimate presented here for the hadronic matrix element of the current - current operator with penguin topology involving @xmath1 and @xmath68 quarks @xcite shows that the main contribution to the sum rule stems from the @xmath4 quark loop annihilating to a hard gluon , fig.1 .",
    "this justifies the generation of the strong rescattering phases in @xmath7 by the ( perturbative ) bss mechanism .",
    "the soft - gluon effects , which in the sum rule approach correspond to multiparticle pion da s , are suppressed , at least by @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , we do not find significant nonperturbative @xmath2 corrections . in @xmath95",
    "limit our result agrees with the qcd factorization prediction for the penguin contractions .",
    "since the strong phase is generated perturbatively , the cp symmetry in @xmath97 is expected to be small . however , at finite @xmath3 we show that @xmath98 corrections to @xmath93 accumulate and can be noticeable .",
