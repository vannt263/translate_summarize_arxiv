    "cavity - mediated bose - einstein condensates system ( becs ) has been widely investigated as a promising platform to explore the exotic many - body phenomena in recent years both in theory and experiment due to the controllability of both the confining potential geometry and the interatomic interaction @xcite .",
    "if the cavity resonance and the atomic resonance are in the large - detuning limit , the dispersive regime can be realized . at this stage",
    ", the strong coupling between the atoms and the cavity field will induces an additional optical potential for the atoms and exerts significant mechanical forces on the motion of the atoms ; meanwhile , the atoms imprint a position dependence phase shift on the cavity field vice versa .",
    "as the field adjusts accordingly , the field causes a back action on the atoms , resulting in the nonlinear atom - field interplay @xcite .",
    "this highly nonlocal nonlinearity is quite different from the usual local atom - atom interactions .",
    "as the cavity - atom interaction induces an optical lattice for the atoms , then the cavity - mediated optical lattice model is one of the usual platform for discussing the cavity - mediated ultracold atoms and becs @xcite .",
    "based on this nonlinear interactions , the cavity field coupling either to the center - of - mass @xcite or to the spin degrees of freedom @xcite and to the both cases @xcite i.e. , the nonlinear coupling among the external and internal states are demonstrated .",
    "recently , rapid proposals have been intensely investigated , which gives rise to a number of interesting nonclassical features such as optical bistability @xcite , collective dynamics @xcite and quantum phase transitions @xcite .    on one hand ,",
    "a cavity - mediated double - well potential is the simplest case of a multiwell potential for studying the cavity - mediated becs system , a plethora of novel phenomena , such as strong population transfer , the complex and diverse stationary behaviors and the pseudo - self - trapping effect , have been observed and analyzed in great detail for the this system because of the unique cavity - mediated nonlinearity in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the role of dissipation in the system of a light field coupled with ultracold atoms trapped in a two - well optical potential in a lossy cavity is also investigated @xcite .",
    "special asymmetric double - well case is studied too , the results show that the performed numerical simulations on bistability in optical lattice have good agreement with the special asymmetric double - well case described by a two - mode model @xcite .    on the other hand , if one wants to make a extension of the double - well system , the triple well is the straightforward natural one . compared with the double well system ,",
    "the difference is essential both in mathematics and physics for the triple well system , which has the following distinguished characteristics .",
    "a triple well potential has a much richer structure @xcite and can supports the simplest model for exhibiting the effect of next - nearest - neighbor coupling on quantum tunneling @xcite , the quantum tunneling may happen between several wells simultaneously , then the tunneling dynamics in the triple well will show more interesting behavior @xcite .",
    "the study of the triple well system will also provide a bridge between the simple double well and the multiwell systems , as a protype of optical lattices , helping us provide a bottom - up understanding of mechanisms operating in the infinite optical lattice @xcite .",
    "moreover , similarly to the analogue of the double well to the josephson junction , the triple well is the minimum system that can model the source - gate - drain junction , and draws much attention from the perspective of atomtronics .",
    "considering these reasons , recently , then there is a growing substantial attention in the dynamics of ultracold atomic clouds in triple - well potentials , a variety of proposals to achieve controllable atomic dynamics based on the triple well have been presented extensively by employing the standard models of the gross - pitaevskii equation and the bose - hubbard hamiltonian mainly .",
    "it includes the eigenstates and the tunneling dynamics @xcite , the transistorlike behavior @xcite , the adiabatic transport of a hole @xcite , and the mesoscopic quantum superpositions @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the optical lattice and double well cases , no work has been studied in the triple well coupled to an optical cavity so far and a fundamental question of whether or not loop structure and chaotic exist is still open",
    ". then theoretical predictions on the dynamics of cavity - mediated becs system in a triple well are highly desirable . on the contrary , as we will show below , the cavity - mediated becs system does introduce qualitatively novel physics in triple well systems .",
    "we will discuss how the nonlinear interaction leads to s loop structure in the energy band .",
    "in addition , we also show how this nonlocal nonlinearity leads to a transition quantum dynamics characterized by striking new phenomena , including the chaotic quantum dynamics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the mean - field approximation is employed to map the quantum model into a classical hamiltonian describing the atoms and the corresponding dynamical equations are derived . in sec .",
    "iii we study the optical bistability in the atom - cavity system and achieve how the intra - cavity - photons and energy band structure depends on the cavity detunings . in sec .",
    "iv we investigate the transition to self - trapping of becs in one well and in two wells , respectively , showing some interesting regions that the chaotic motion and steady behavior emerge alternately .",
    "the topics are extended to a tilted triple - well system in sec .",

    "it can be found that the atom - cavity coupling results into different effects for the different relative phase as mentioned in [ fig7 ] . after passing a wide oscillation region ,",
    "the oscillation and the chaos behavior are compressed into a narrow region and the atoms will be trapped equally for a large interaction @xmath76 in the two traps eventually where they are initially uploaded for three cases . from fig.[fig8](b ) , we can find that the noninteracting atoms are mostly trapped in well @xmath106 due to the coupling to the cavity for the relative phase @xmath112 , but with the increase of the interaction , the population decrease quickly and enter a chaotic process .",
    "when the relative phase is chosen as zero , the cavity - mediated effects only enlarge the oscillation region , but for the other two relative phases cases , this nonlinearity not only enlarge the oscillation region but also make more chaotic behavior . then we can change the relative phases to control the dynamics of the becs in this cavity - mediated triple well .",
    "the above are scheduled to study the localization of becs in two wells . as",
    "the triple well system is a protype of optical lattices helping us provide a bottom - up understanding of mechanisms operating in the infinite optical lattice . here",

    "we calculate the average value @xmath111 @xmath75 as a function of @xmath76 for different relative phases in fig .",
    "the uncoupled cases are also shown for comparison .",
    "it can be easily found that the dynamics is also sensitively related to the initial phase but the phase does not show a pronounced effect as it does in the two wells cases .",
    "the coupling to the cavity also enlarges the oscillation region and make more chaotic for the cases of the relative phase @xmath112 and @xmath113 . while the relative phase is zero , the atom - cavity interplay may be neglected for its very weak influence on the dynamics , the becs atoms show same process moving smoothly to a robust trapped behavior from the a small interaction @xmath76 both for the coupled and uncoupled cases .",
    "in the above , we have studied the dynamics of the cavity - mediated becs in the symmetric triple - well cases ( @xmath54 ) . though the cavity - mediated potential makes the triple - well tilted as the zero - energy @xmath5 does , the actual experiments values",
    ", @xmath118 only leads the triple well to tilt slightly . how does the cavity - mediated potential affect the dynamics of the becs for the asymmetric triple - well cases , and what will happen for a cavity - mediated tilted triple - well system ? in order to answer these interesting questions ,",
    "this section will extended to the general case with @xmath92 . in the following , the self trapping or localization in one- , two- , and three - wells",
    "are investigated , respectively .",
    "we explore the dynamics of of the becs by depicting the mean populations for the uncoupled and coupled cases versus the parameter @xmath76 with @xmath92 and the initial conditions are @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figs . [ fig10](a)@xmath119[fig10](f ) . in fig.[fig10](b ) , with an increase in the interaction @xmath76 , the averaged population @xmath109 decreases smoothly at the beginning , passes a large oscillating and chaotic areas till @xmath120 , and then tends to unite .",
    "compared to the uncoupled case ( fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) ) , it can be found that the transition area and the critical value @xmath76 are larger for the coupled case due to the reason that the atom - cavity interplay enhances the oscillation of the becs atoms of each wells .",
    "thus a larger interaction @xmath76 is used to trap the condensates . compared",
    "fig.[fig10](b ) with fig.[fig6](b ) , one can also find that , when the interaction is small , the coupling to the cavity will help the becs atoms nearly be trapped in well @xmath106 for the tilted case . in fig .",
    "[ fig10](d ) , the cavity - mediated interaction will make the averaged population @xmath109 show a turbulent behavior from a small interaction @xmath76 , passes a wide chaos region , and then jumps up and tends to unite . in fig .",
    "[ fig10](f ) , initially , upload all the atoms in the right - hand well , with an increase in @xmath76 , the average population @xmath121 undergo a smooth process , then tend to unite . in comparison to fig .",
    "[ fig10](e ) , it is shown that the coupling to the cavity will lead to a larger critical value of the interaction @xmath76",
    ".      except the wells are tilted , the parameters and the initial conditions in fig.[fig11 ] are as same as the ones in fig.[fig7 ] . compared with these two figures , we can find that besides the phase sensitivity and the enlarging chaotic region , the difference is , the condensates atoms for the relative phase @xmath113 will be trapped too for the tilted wells cases .",
    "furthermore , the mean value of @xmath109 is always small than @xmath110 the due to the tilted wells , i.e. , the atom - cavity induced tilt potential is weak than the tilt of the well , and then it can not make a inversion as it does in the symmetric well cases . the mean value @xmath104 for different initial phases with the initial value @xmath83 , @xmath87 , @xmath86 for the tilted well cases is shown in fig.[fig12 ] . compared to fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we may find two characteristics due to the tilted well , one is the the smooth motion of atoms for the relative phase zero become more chaotic due to the common effects of the tilted well and the atom - cavity induced potential .",
    "the other is the trapped mean population of @xmath109 is large than @xmath109 due to the tilt . for comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the becs atoms trapped in the tilted three wells simultaneously with initial @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are also investigated shown in fig.[fig13 ] .",
    "one obvious phenomena is for the relative phase zero case , when the well is tilted only , the mean values of @xmath122 is still smooth . when the tilted tripe well couples with the cavity , the atom - cavity interaction will destroy this smooth behavior and make the dynamics become chaotic for small interaction @xmath76 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the bistable curves and the tunneling dynamics of becs in the cavity - mediated triple - well system within the mean field approach .",
    "we find that the atom - cavity nonlinearity will make the bistability occur both in the number of the photons of the cavity and in the energy structure of the becs .",
    "furthermore , the loops appear for the upper and lower energy levels with the pump - cavity detuning increasing .",
    "we also demonstrated that the transition to localization of a becs can be efficiently controlled by the optical cavity . to understand the effects resulting form the cavity coupling ,",
    "we have performed a detailed numerical simulation both for the symmetric and asymmetric cases .",
    "for the cases of becs atoms uploaded in well @xmath106 initially , the atom - cavity field nonlinearity enlarges the oscillation and chaotic regions both for the symmetric and asymmetric cases , then a large interaction is needed to trap the atoms .",
    "when the becs atoms are uploaded in well @xmath108 initially , this nonlinearity only have a pronounced effects for the asymmetric case , which makes more chaos .    for the cases of becs atoms uploaded in two wells initially , the cavity have different effects for different relative phases .",
    "with the increase of the interaction , the atoms will be trapped in one or two wells where they initially uploaded . besides this , the coupling to cavity can lead a mean population inversion for certain relative phase if the becs atoms are initially uploaded in wells @xmath106 and @xmath108 .    for the cases of the becs atoms uploaded in three wells initially",
    ", there is a robust trapped phenomena for the relative phase zero in the symmetric wells even for the coupled cases .",
