    "the two - dimensional non - linear o(@xmath0 ) @xmath1-model is interesting in theoretical physics in many respects . in condensed matter physics",
    ", the model can be applied to the study of ferromagnetic systems . in elementary particle physics , on the other hand , it serves as a good toy model for the investigation of the strong interactions since it shares with qcd many common properties .",
    "the most interesting property of the @xmath1-model from the view of particle physicists is that of asymptotic freedom which is predicted by perturbation theory . besides this",
    ", the model shows many additional interesting properties .",
    "one believes a non - perturbative generation of a mass gap via dimensional transmutation which controls the exponential decay of correlation functions at large distances . from the existence of an infinite set of conserved non - local quantum charges  @xcite",
    ", one can show that there is no particle production in the theory and also derive `` factorization equations '' directly .",
    "these properties lead finally to the exact determination of the @xmath5-matrix up to a cdd - ambiguity  @xcite , assuming that the spectrum of the theory is known . by making use of the exact @xmath5-matrix and",
    "the thermodynamic bethe ansatz , hasenfratz and niedermayer determined the ratio of the mass gap to the @xmath6-parameter @xmath7 of the theory exactly  @xcite .",
    "if one formulates the @xmath1-model on the lattice , it has a further advantage : due to low dimensionality it is simple to simulate numerically and can therefore be used in many cases for testing new ideas in lattice theories .",
    "the property of asymptotic freedom is based on the validity of perturbation theory .",
    "one usually formulates perturbation theory on a non - symmetric trivial vacuum .",
    "the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite , however , tells us that in o(@xmath0 ) @xmath1-model the continuous o(@xmath0 ) symmetry can not be spontaneously broken in two dimensions .",
    "therefore , the validity of the perturbation theory in infinite volume is in fact not guaranteed .",
    "this observation , together with the lack of clear asymptotic scaling in simulations , gives some authors  @xcite a motive for an argument that the non - linear o(@xmath0 ) @xmath1-model has no mass gap and for any @xmath8 it undergoes a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition  @xcite at a finite coupling @xmath9 .",
    "monte carlo simulations allow in principle to explore the behavior of a model in all areas of the bare coupling .",
    "it is of general interest to connect monte carlo results with those of the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) which should dictate the scaling laws of the theory near the fixed point @xmath10 . for a precise comparison with the monte carlo data ,",
    "the computation of the rg functions at high orders in perturbation theory is desirable .",
    "until now they are known up to four loops where the long and difficult four - loop computation was recently done by caracciolo and pelissetto  @xcite .",
    "these determinations of the four - loop @xmath4- and @xmath11-functions then allow us to compute the correlation length @xmath2 and spin susceptibility @xmath3 up to second analytic correction .",
    "we applied an efficient coordinate space method for the evaluation of lattice feynman diagrams described in detail in our paper  @xcite to compute the integrals listed in the paper by caracciolo et al . more precisely . in most integrals , our results showed good agreement with those by caracciolo et al .",
    "we , however , found that three integrals were not correctly evaluated .",
    "since these errors turn out to cause sizable changes in the perturbative prediction to @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well as in our determination of the mass gap by a finite volume technique  @xcite , we would like to report our results for the evaluation of the lattice integrals together with the corrections to the physical prediction to @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well as to our determination of the mass gap .",
    "furthermore , the four - loop rg functions evaluated by caracciolo et al . were applied in many papers  @xcite and it is necessary to revise them in accordance with our corrected values for the rg functions .",
    "we would like to stress that we checked only a minor part of the four - loop rg functions by caracciolo et al .",
    ", where we just reevaluated the integrals listed in that paper . we still do not know whether the other analytic formulas are correct . for the complete confirmation of the four - loop rg functions , it would take a while until we finish our own computation of them which is in progress  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the @xmath1-model and give in this model the hitherto known results for the perturbative rg functions including the four - loop determination by caracciolo et al . and its corrected version by us .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is then devoted to the reinvestigation of the physical quantities by making use of our corrected values for the rg functions .",
    "finally , the explicit evaluations of lattice feynman diagrams are presented in the appendix .",
    "we consider the non - linear @xmath12 @xmath1-model in two dimensions defined by the action @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 with @xmath15 is an @xmath0-component real scalar field of unit length @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes the bare coupling constant .",
    "@xmath18 is here a magnetic field which regularizes the infrared divergences and explicitly breaks the o(@xmath0 ) symmetry , lining up the field along the component @xmath19 . at small coupling",
    ", one can then consider small fluctuations around the direction of the magnetic field . in this way",
    ", the perturbative expansions in @xmath17 can be obtained by setting q(x)=\\{_1(x),,_n-1(x ) , ^1/2 } which solves the constraint @xmath16 .",
    "the regulator @xmath18 can be removed at the final stage of the computation .",
    "this is guarenteed by the conjecture of elitzur  @xcite , proved later by david order by order in perturbation theory  @xcite , which states that in o(@xmath0 ) @xmath1-model , o(@xmath0 ) invariant correlation functions have a finite infrared limit in two dimensions .    with this prescription , one can now start to compute the physically interesting quantities according to perturbation theory .",
    "higher loop computations are however accompanied by ultraviolet divergences , which requires a renormalization .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a regularization and redefining bare fields @xmath20 and coupling @xmath17 as renormalized ones , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the dimensional regularization with dimension @xmath23 ,",
    "one sets @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the @xmath26 and @xmath27 , taken as a series in @xmath22 , are adjusted so that the renormalized theory satisfies a chosen set of two independent conditions .",
    "choosing @xmath28 as the scale of the renormalized theory , if one changes @xmath28 , one has to change the renormalized fields and coupling accordingly , which is represented by the rg equation [ rgeqms ] \\{+ ( f)+n(f ) + h } g_r^(n)(p , f,;h ) = 0 , where @xmath29 is the renormalized @xmath0-point correlation function for the @xmath21 field and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath4- and @xmath11-functions respectively : ( f)&=&f= -b_1f^2-b_2f^3-b_3f^4-b_4f^5+o(f^6 ) , + ( f)&=&z= c_1f+c_2f^2+c_3f^3+c_4f^4+o(f^5 ) . the coefficients @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "are universal in the sense that they do not depend on the renormalization scheme chosen and explicitly given by [ beta1ms ] b_1 & = & , + [ beta2ms ] b_2 & = & , + c_1 & = & .",
    "all other higher terms are , on the other hand , scheme dependent . in the minimal subtraction ( ms )",

    "if one formulates the @xmath1-model on the lattice , there are many different ways to define actions to regularize the theory . here",
    ", we would like to consider the standard nearest - neighbor action @xmath36 the rg equation on the lattice which is formally the same as eq .",
