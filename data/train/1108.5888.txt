    "the simplest version of the gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite is a 1 + 1 dimensional model quantum field theory of @xmath0 species of massless , self - interacting dirac fermions with lagrangian @xmath1 we consider this model in the t  hooft limit , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 constant , where semiclassical methods become exact . in spite of its apparent simplicity ,",
    "the model ( [ a1 ] ) gives rise to quite non - trivial physical phenomena of interest for strong interaction particle physics as well as condensed matter physics .",
    "this has been established in works spread out over several decades , in an effort which is still ongoing , as we shall see .",
    "the original work from 1974 was motivated in part by the discovery of asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , a property which the gn model shares . the main focus in ref .",
    "@xcite was on spontaneous breaking of the discrete chiral symmetry @xmath4 , fermion mass generation via dimensional transmutation and the scalar @xmath5 meson .",
    "soon afterwards , multifermion bound states ( baryons ) were found by dashen , hasslacher and neveu ( dhn ) in a study of the associated gap equation @xcite .",
    "the gap equation solution for the static dhn baryon scalar potential is @xmath6 where the @xmath7 parameter satisfies @xmath8 .",
    "dhn baryons have a valence bound state which can be filled with up to @xmath0 fermions . in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", the filling fraction @xmath9 becomes a continuous parameter , so that there is in fact a whole one - parameter family of baryons . for self - consistency in the gap equation",
    ", the filling fraction @xmath10 is related to @xmath7 by @xmath11 .",
    "the dhn baryons span the region from a weakly bound , non - relativistic state at small filling to the ultrarelativistic limit of a decoupled kink and antikink at complete filling . at large filling fraction",
    ", the dhn baryon looks like a bound kink - antikink molecule , and it is stable not because of topology but because of a balance between the kink - antikink interaction and the effect of the fermions bound to the kink and antikink .",
    "this leads to a direct relation between the baryon size ( the distance between the kink and antikink ) and the fermion filling fraction , giving a beautiful example of dynamical stability as well as of the jackiw - rebbi mechanism of fermion modes bound to localized defects such as kinks @xcite .",
    "this `` anatomy '' of the dhn baryon is sketched in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "a particularly interesting special case is the baryon with non - trivial topology , the kink , which is attributed to callan , coleman , gross and zee ( ccgz ) ( cited in @xcite ) .",
    "later , feinberg established the complete set of static solutions to the large @xmath0 gap equation @xcite , combining inverse scattering theory with resolvent techniques .",
    "the general solution consists of marginally bound multibaryon configurations whose energy does not depend on the distance between the constituents .",
    "a common feature of all static solutions is the fact that the self - consistent scalar potentials are reflectionless , generalizing the kay - moses potentials of the schrdinger equation @xcite to the dirac equation @xcite .    .",
    "the scalar field @xmath12 is shown as the solid blue line going asymptotically to 1 ( in units of the dynamically generated fermion mass in the gn model ) .",
    "the fermion density , @xmath13 , for the bound valence mode is shown as a black dotted line ; note that the density is localized at the kink and antikink of the baryon scalar field .",
    "the pseudoscalar condensate , @xmath14 , for the valence state is plotted as a red dashed curve , while the scalar condensate , @xmath15 , for the valence state is plotted as a purple dot - dashed curve ( @xmath5 has been multiplied by a factor of 100 , for visualization purposes ) .",
    "the scalar condensate is nonzero inside the dhn baryon , while the pseudoscalar condensate is localized at the edges , on the kink and antikink , like the density @xmath16 but with a change of sign . ]",
    "the baryons of the gn model also play a key role in the properties of matter at finite density and temperature .",
    "the preferred state of cold matter in the gn model was shown to be a crystal , consisting of an array of kinks and antikinks @xcite .",
    "the fact that the single baryon potential is reflectionless translates ( at finite density ) into a `` finite - gap '' periodic potential , expressed analytically in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "the phase diagram as a function of temperature and chemical potential displays a soliton crystal phase , a massive and a massless fermi gas phase , and has turned out to be much richer than originally thought @xcite .",
    "semiclassical methods are not restricted to static solutions .",
    "since we are dealing with a relativistic field theory , we can boost any static solution to an arbitrary lorentz frame , turning a static hartree - fock ( hf ) solution into a solution of the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) approach , @xmath17 indeed , it was anticipated already in witten s seminal paper on baryons in the @xmath18 expansion in qcd @xcite , that baryon - baryon scattering might be solved with the help of the tdhf approach at large @xmath0 . in this paper we realize this goal explicitly for the gn model .",
    "the tdhf approach has already been exploited to compute structure functions of dhn baryons and ccgz kinks , further confirming the value of the gn model as a toy model for qcd @xcite .",
    "in addition to boosted static solutions , some truly dynamical solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) are also known .",
    "they are harder to find than static hf solutions since inverse scattering theory is not developed enough for tdhf .",
    "the efforts to find non - trivial , time dependent mean field solutions were also pioneered by dhn who already presented a breather solution , a periodically oscillating ( in time ) multifermion bound state @xcite .",
    "dhn also pointed out the possibility to relate the breather to the kink - antikink scattering problem by analytic continuation .",
    "this suggestion was taken up and elaborated in several recent works .",
    "kink - antikink scattering was addressed in @xcite .",
    "apart from a first glimpse of the scattering problem of composite , relativistic objects , the solution also gave several new insights into the mathematical structure of the theory .",
    "a special feature of kink dynamics is the fact that the ( valence ) fermions do not react back on the solitons that are carrying them .",
    "this decoupling made it possible to formulate kink dynamics in the language of a well - studied , classical soliton theory , the sinh - gordon model @xcite , and to use the known @xmath19-soliton solution of this model to generalize kink - antikink scattering to the case of an arbitrary number of kink - like baryons @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of tdhf theory , the most striking feature of all kink - antikink solutions is the fact that the scalar density of each single - fermion level is proportional to the full self - consistent potential @xmath20 .",
    "this kind of solution where self - consistency holds mode - by - mode was called type i in @xcite .",
    "this feature in turn opens the way to a geometrical interpretation of hf solutions of the gn model in terms of embedding 2d surfaces into 3d spaces @xcite .",
    "self - consistency translates into the condition of constant mean curvature .",
    "one can then understand the relationship to minimal surfaces in ads@xmath21 and hence string worldsheets in simple terms , a relation which had been found via the sinh - gordon equation @xcite but was otherwise completely mysterious in @xcite .    as nice as kinks",
    "are mathematically , they form only one extreme endpoint of the dhn baryon family . to complete the picture",
    ", we need to understand the scattering of general dhn baryons , without the restriction to kinks and antikinks .",
    "the solution to the scattering problem for two arbitrary dhn baryons would allow one to probe the degree to which the internal bound state structure is relativistic , all the way from the non - relativistic limit to the ultrarelativistic one .",
    "on the other hand , by choosing the velocity of the baryons , one can cover the range from non - relativistic to relativistic scattering in the external kinematics as well .",
    "this situation is sketched in figure 2 .",
    "lines show the scalar potential , while the dotted [ black ] lines show the density of the bound valence fermions .",
    "note that each asymptotic dhn baryon can have different internal structure ( i.e. , a different @xmath7 parameter ) , which affects the baryon size and shape as well as the internal fermion densities ; this will be important for understanding the scattering processes . by varying the structural parameters , and also the relative velocity parameter",

    ", we can probe various interesting physical regimes , spanning continuously from relativistic to non - relativistic.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this general problem is not easy , as evidenced by the fact that it has never been addressed in the literature so far , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "no established , systematic method for solving the tdhf equations is available .",
    "since the valence fermions are now expected to react back , it is also unlikely that one can map the problem onto some known soliton theory , like sinh - gordon theory for the kinks .",
    "we propose to solve this problem here by a method based upon an ansatz . as a matter of fact , due to the self - consistency issue , we know neither the equation nor its solution to start with , so that guessing the right ansatz is quite a challenge .",
    "we will explain how a simultaneous ansatz for the scalar tdhf potential and the ( bound and continuum ) spinors can nevertheless be found heuristically .",
    "the solution of the dirac equation and the requirement of self - consistency are sufficient to determine the unknown parameters of the ansatz and to establish an exact baryon - baryon scattering solution in the large @xmath0 limit of the gn model .",
    "the fact that this procedure is successful is undoubtedly related to the integrability of the gn model at finite @xmath0 @xcite , although we are not aware of any direct path from the integrability of the finite @xmath0 gn model to the large @xmath0 solution which we find here . perhaps more important than the specific solution found here",
    "is the fact that the ansatz can be generalized in a natural way to a whole class of more complicated scattering problems , also involving multibaryon bound states and breathers in addition to dhn baryons .",

    "the dhn baryon @xcite is a well - understood multifermion bound state of the large @xmath0 gn model .",
    "originally derived in the rest frame by the inverse scattering method , it can easily be boosted to any other inertial frame .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the baryon in flight within the dirac - tdhf approach . in this section ,",
    "we introduce our ansatz method by pretending that we do nt know the dhn solution .",
    "this illustrates how one can find a self - consistent solution of the dirac - tdhf equation ( [ a2 ] ) with a judiciously chosen ansatz for the scalar potential and the spinors .",
    "apart from this ansatz , a crucial ingredient of our approach is the systematic use of lightcone coordinates and variables .",
    "these greatly simplify the final results , due to their simple lorentz transformation properties .",
    "we introduce all the necessary definitions here in a familiar context .",
    "the results for the single baryon in a general lorentz frame and in the most convenient language are obviously a prerequisite for addressing the two - baryon scattering problem , where they appear as incoming and outgoing asymptotic states .",
    "the key quantity for any dirac - tdhf calculation in the gn model is the scalar potential @xmath20 .",
    "guided by the idea that the baryon potential has a kink - antikink shape as well as by covariance , we use as ansatz a rational function of an exponential @xmath22 , @xmath23 with @xmath24 @xmath7 is a parameter governing the size and shape of the potential , @xmath25 the baryon velocity .",
    "note that for a static ( @xmath26 ) dhn baryon , the solution in ( [ dhn - s ] ) can be re - written in this form as @xmath27 and it is straightforward to boost this single baryon solution .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath20 must reach the value of the dynamical fermion mass , set to 1 by our choice of units , @xmath28 this yields the conditions @xmath29 by shifting the origin of the @xmath30 or @xmath31 axis we can rescale @xmath22 and hence impose one further condition which we choose as @xmath32 leaving us with two unknown , real coefficients @xmath33 , @xmath34 we now turn to the dirac - tdhf equation ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "we use a chiral representation of the dirac matrices , @xmath35 , and introduce lightcone coordinates @xmath36 @xmath22 then becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 turns out to be a more convenient variable than either the rapidity @xmath39 or the velocity @xmath25 .",
    "the dirac equation assumes the simple form @xmath40 in terms of the chiral spinor components @xmath41 .    in the next step ,",
    "we try to solve eqs .",
    "( [ 1.11 ] ) by an ansatz for the spinors .",
    "we assume from the outset that the potential is reflectionless and that the spinor has the same structure as @xmath20 , multiplied by an exponential ( plane wave ) factor . in order to have a chance of solving the dirac equation",
    ", the denominator will be taken to be identical to the one of @xmath20 , whereas we admit arbitrary complex coefficients in the numerator .",
    "consider the continuum spinors first .",
    "they are written as @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 from ( [ 1.6 ] ) .",
    "the exponent can be rephrased in lightcone variables as @xmath45 with the spectral parameter @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( note the more symmetric definition of @xmath46 as compared to ref .",

    ", @xmath46 gets simply rescaled under lorentz transformations .",
    "the sign of @xmath50 is encoded in the sign of @xmath46 , so that all results for continuum states hold for both signs of the energy .",
    "notice also that it is not necessary to introduce two kinematical variables ( lightcone momentum and lightcone energy ) , since only on - shell variables enter here .",
    "the asymptotics again puts constraints on the parameters of our ansatz for the spinors .",
    "comparison with the solution of the free , massive ( @xmath51 ) dirac equation , @xmath52 yields @xmath53 here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determined by the incident wave , @xmath56 and @xmath57 by the transmitted wave , @xmath58 is the unitary transmission amplitude , @xmath59 .",
    "the complex parameters @xmath60 have to be determined from the dirac equation , together with the real parameters @xmath33 in @xmath20 .",
    "we now insert the ansatz for @xmath20 and @xmath61 into the dirac equation .",
    "since differentiation and multiplication yields again rational functions of the exponential @xmath22 , we can equate powers of @xmath22 , reducing the problem to an algebraic one .",
    "owing to the use of lightcone variables , the calculation is straightforward , yielding the following results @xmath62 @xmath63 denotes the spectral parameter @xmath46 , boosted into the rest frame of the baryon .",
    "let us consider the bound state spinors next .",
    "the transmission amplitude @xmath58 has 2 poles in the complex @xmath63-plane , @xmath64 corresponding to the positive and negative energy bound states at @xmath65 in the rest frame of the baryon . since the potential is transparent , the spinor may be regarded as a continuum spinor , analytically continued to complex @xmath46 . for positive energy spinors , this suggests the ansatz @xmath66 with the exponent @xmath67 and @xmath68 since @xmath69 constant terms with @xmath70 have to be omitted in the numerators ( [ 1.22 ] ) for the sake of normalizability .",
    "if one inserts this ansatz into the dirac equation , one can determine the unknown parameters algebraically except for the overall normalization with the result @xmath71 the parameter @xmath72 then follows from the normalization condition which we choose in the non - covariant form @xmath73 yielding @xmath74 before proceeding , we have to introduce one further element of lightcone notation .",
    "one advantage of using @xmath46 and @xmath75 rather than @xmath76 and @xmath25 is the fact that all square roots of the type @xmath77 are eliminated . in order to avoid also @xmath78 , it is advantageous to combine @xmath79 into the complex variable @xmath80 introduced in ( [ 1.19 ] ) .",
    "using the fact that @xmath81 , we get @xmath82 in this new notation the relevant single baryon quantities read @xmath83 all other coefficients are the same as in eqs .",
    "( [ 1.17 ] ) and ( [ 1.23 ] ) .",
    "a minor shortcoming of this notation is the fact that the unitarity of @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) is not manifest .",
    "thus for instance , the transmission amplitude @xmath58 could also be represented as @xmath84 since @xmath85 .",
    "this would show at once the poles of the positive ( @xmath86 ) and negative ( @xmath87 ) energy bound states , as well as the fact that @xmath59 . to ease the notation of more complicated expressions later on however",
    ", we prefer not to use complex conjugate variables and will stick to the notation of eqs .",
    "( [ 1.26 ] ) .",
    "notice that one could also generate the bound state spinor by analytic continuation from the continuum spinors ( up to the normalization factor ) , rather than by ansatz . as one can easily check , it is sufficient to evaluate the residue of @xmath61 at the pole @xmath88 . finally , the negative energy bound state spinor can trivially be obtained from the positive energy one by the mapping @xmath89 , so that there is no need to discuss it separately .      having determined the free parameters in the ansatz for @xmath20 and solved the dirac equation ,",
    "we proceed to verify self - consistency and derive the relation between the parameter @xmath7 and the fermion number of the dhn baryon . to this end , we first need the scalar density @xmath90 for all occupied states .",
    "we decompose the scalar density for continuum states computed from the above spinors as follows , @xmath91 positive and negative energy bound states on the other hand yield @xmath92 the scalar density of any occupied state can be written as a linear combination of two independent functions of ( @xmath93 ) , so that we are dealing with a type ii solution of the tdhf problem . in the case of the kink , @xmath94 so that ( @xmath95 and the bound state scalar density vanish and the solution becomes type i.    the self - consistency relation in the massless gross - neveu model is @xmath96 renormalization of the coupling constant is performed with the help of the vacuum gap equation ( @xmath97 ) , using a cutoff regularization @xmath98 we find @xmath99 so that eq .",
    "( [ 1.30 ] ) becomes @xmath100 the first contribution to the chiral condensate from the continuum in eq .",
    "( [ 1.28 ] ) already gives self - consistency , @xmath101 hence the 2nd contribution , @xmath102 must cancel the contributions from the discrete states ( occupation fractions @xmath103 ) , @xmath104 this determines the parameter @xmath7 , given the occupation of the bound states . for the ground state baryons ( @xmath105 ) in particular , we recover the result of dhn , @xmath106 in order to relate the occupation fractions @xmath103 of the bound states to the fermion number of the baryon , we still have to compute the fermion density , including the induced contribution from the dirac sea .",
    "the density of the continuum states can be expressed through @xmath20 as follows , @xmath107 subtracting the divergent density of the non - interacting dirac sea , this yields the following contribution to the fermion density , @xmath108 positive and negative energy bound states give the density @xmath109 the total ( subtracted ) fermion density of the dhn baryon can therefore be expressed in terms of the bound state density as @xmath110 whereas the fermion number becomes @xmath111 if @xmath105 ( ground state baryon ) , the induced fermion density from the continuum and the fermion density from the negative energy bound state cancel exactly , so that one can read off the full fermion density from the positive valence level alone .",
    "we finish this section with a comment on the massive gn model , i.e. , lagrangian ( [ a1 ] ) supplemented by a mass term @xmath112 .",
    "it is well known that the functional form of @xmath20 of the dhn baryon also solves the massive gn model , the only difference being the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath103 @xcite . the self - consistency condition ( [ 1.30 ] )",

    "we now apply the ansatz method to a more difficult problem where the solution is not known  scattering of two dhn baryons with different baryon numbers ( parameters @xmath119 ) . to keep the number of parameters as small as possible",

    "the spinors are again taken to be exponentials times functions similar to @xmath20 , where we always insist on keeping the same denominators . in the single baryon case , the asymptotic information which we used to reduce the number of parameters came from the vacuum .",
    "now we will similarly exploit the asymptotic information from the incoming and outgoing baryons .",
    "this recursive way of proceeding greatly reduces the number of parameters which then have to be determined algebraically via the dirac equation .",
    "our ansatz for the scalar potential is @xmath121 with @xmath122 @xmath123 and @xmath124 the @xmath125 dependence is motivated by the product of the two baryon potentials , which we must recover when the scatterers are well separated . in this sense , the ansatz is the minimal one having a chance of describing baryon - baryon scattering .",
    "almost all of the 16 real parameters in @xmath20 are determined by the asymptotic in- and out - states as follows . for @xmath126",
    ", @xmath20 reduces to @xmath127 near incoming baryon 1 and to @xmath128 near incoming baryon 2 . for @xmath129",

    "<S> the scattering of two dashen - hasslacher - neveu ( dhn ) baryons in the large @xmath0 gross - neveu model is solved exactly using the relativistic , time - dependent hartree - fock approach . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the special case of kink - antikink scattering , the scattering of dhn baryons is sensitive to the back - reaction of the fermions bound inside the baryons . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly the solution is much more complicated than the kink - antikink scattering solutions , which can be expressed in terms of sinh - gordon solitons . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we present a simple ansatz form that gives closed analytic expressions for both the space - time dependent mean fields and the dirac spinors for all continuum and bound states . the solution can also be applied to the scattering of polarons and solitons in conducting polymers . </S>"
