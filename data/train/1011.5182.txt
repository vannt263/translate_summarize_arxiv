    "the theory of holonomies and geometric phases associated with evolutions of a quantum system is by now a well developed subject .",
    "the initial work by berry @xcite on the abelian geometric phase of adiabatic evolutions of non - degenerate states has been extended in many directions , to include non - adiabatic evolutions @xcite as well as non - abelian holonomies of sets of degenerate states @xcite , and to mixed states @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently discovered that the quantum geometric phase had an early counterpart in the geometric phase discovered by pancharatnam in the context of classical optics @xcite .",
    "the pancharatnam construction has been generalized to the non - abelian case by utilizing subspaces @xcite .",
    "more recently holonomies that bear a relation to correlations have been constructed in the context of multipartite and lattice systems @xcite .",
    "the idea of this paper is to develop the concept of geometric phases in another direction and use two - particle interferometry to construct correlation induced non - abelian holonomies in a way that does not depend on degeneracy , but on the ability to divide the system into spatially separated subsystems .",
    "instead of considering parallel transport of subspaces , we consider the natural tensor product structure of a bipartite state , induced by the spatial separation of the two subsystems , and local unitary operations to define the parallel transport .",
    "the parallel transport condition to be introduced is similar to that of the pancharatnam construction @xcite , in which two states @xmath1 and @xmath2 of a quantum system are defined to be in - phase if their scalar product @xmath3 is a positive number .",
    "this condition can be implemented in a mach - zehnder interferometric setup , where the spatial state of the system prior to the last beam splitter is a coherent superposition of the two paths @xcite . if we let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the internal states corresponding to the output of respective paths of the interferometer , then pancharatnam parallelity is achieved by shifting a @xmath4 phase in one of the paths , such that the interference intensity is maximal .    in two - particle interferometry",
    "@xcite the spatial state of the two - particle system is a coherent superposition of two distinct pairs of correlated paths for the two subsystems . in the same spirit as pancharatnam",
    "we use a two - particle interferometric intensity , namely the coincidence intensity in a franson interferometer @xcite , to define an `` in - phase '' condition and the corresponding parallel transport .",
    "an arbitrary unitary operation is performed in one of the arms of the interferometer on the first subsystem , thus making the outputs of the two possible pairs of paths different .",
    "subsequently , another unitary operation is performed in the other arm on the second subsystem , and is chosen such as to achieve maximal coincidence intensity .",
    "this second unitary is considered to be the `` phase '' degree of freedom of the system and at maximal intensity the two outputs are considered to be `` in - phase '' , or `` parallel '' . thus we consider the orbit space formed by the state space of the system modulo this unitary degree of freedom on the second subsystem to be the space in which the system is parallel transported .    in the special case of pure two - qubit states , and evolutions generated by local @xmath0 operations ,",
    "the state space naturally fibrates through the second hopf fibration and the orbit space of the two qubit - states can be mapped to the state space of a quaternionic qubit @xcite .",
    "the coincidence intensity of the franson interferometer , in this case , corresponds to the quaternionic quantum mechanics analogue of the mach - zehnder intensity and the associated parallel transport condition corresponds to the lvay connection @xcite restricted to local @xmath0 evolutions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "it turns out that the stokes tensor formalism @xcite is convenient for our analysis .",
    "therefore we briefly review this representation in section [ filt ] .",
    "section [ punt ] contains a description of the franson interferometric setup and we define the parallelity condition in this setting . in section @xmath5",
    ", we describe the parallel transport procedure , discuss the properties of the related holonomy group and introduce the corresponding connection form .",
    "finally , in section [ gnutt ] we consider the parallel transport scheme in the special case of pure two - qubit states , and evolutions generated by @xmath0 operations and its relation to the quaternionic representation of pure two - qubit states and the corresponding lvay connection .",
    "the paper ends with the conclusions .",

    "we focus on bipartite systems @xmath34 and therefore it can be instructive to consider some general properties of the stokes 2-tensor . the zeroth row and zeroth column of the tensor , with elements @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , are the stokes 1-tensors corresponding to the reduced states of subsystem @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and these contain all the local information of the bipartite system .",

    "it should be noted that the @xmath47 matrix transforms under local unitary operations on subsystem @xmath37 and @xmath38 through left and right action , respectively , by orthogonal matrices .    as an example of how the @xmath47 matrix behaves we can consider a pure two - qubit state in the schmidt basis @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are real non - negative numbers and @xmath51 .",
    "expressed in the schmidt basis , the correlation matrix with elements @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , being the standard pauli operators on subsystem @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the pure state concurrence @xcite .",
    "here it is clearly seen that @xmath47 is rank one for product states .",
    "it must be emphasized that @xmath58 because we choose @xmath59 .",
    "the elements of @xmath47 are not explicit functions of concurrence for arbitrary complex coefficients @xmath60 . however , since all pure two - qubit states with the same concurrence can be related by local unitaries , corresponding to orthogonal transformations acting from the right and the left on @xmath47 , the absolute value of the determinant of @xmath47 @xmath61 is invariant under local unitary transformations and measures concurrence . for maximally entangled states we thus have",
    "that @xmath62 .",
    "when we consider mixed states there can be correlations also in separable states .",
    "as an example of how the @xmath47 matrix registers correlation for mixed states we can consider the werner states @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is some maximally entangled state and @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the absolute value of the determinant is @xmath66 , which can be compared to the square of the concurrence @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "thus for @xmath68 the determinant of @xmath47 is nonzero even though the state is separable .",
    "this underscores that the @xmath47 matrix for mixed states is sensitive to correlations in general .",
    "a franson interferometer @xcite , is a two - particle device composed of two identical unbalanced two - path interferometers , so - called franson loops , as shown in fig .",
    "the two parts of the bipartite state are emitted , one into each franson loop .",
    "a beam splitter divides each path in two different paths of unequal length , which later converge at a second beam splitter .",
    "the difference in path length between the two arms in each franson loop is chosen to be the same , and such that the difference in transit time @xmath69 is greater than the single particle coherence time .",
    "the transit time difference between the paths must be smaller than the coherence time of the bipartite state to allow two - particle interference .",
    "of importance is that the emitter is such that is impossible to define a time of emission .",
    "detectors are placed after the convergence of the two paths in each franson loop and coincidence measurements are made .        since we [ ghgh]discard non - coincidental detections ,",
    "corresponding to the bipartite system traversing a long path in one of the franson loops and a short path in the other , it is necessary that the time resolution of the detectors is smaller than @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , due to the requirement that time of emission can not be defined , and since no measurements are made inside the franson loops , it can not be ascribed to a coincidence detection event that the bipartite system traversed either the two short paths or the two long ones .",
    "hence the system is in a coherent superposition of having traversed the two long arms , and having traversed the two short arms . in the long paths of each sub - interferometer we place devices that perform unitary operations on the internal state of the bipartite state .",
    "after the point of convergence of the two paths , the effective unnormalized internal state is under the above requirements therefore    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the initial internal state .",
    "given @xmath72 , and @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the generators of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , the coincidence detection intensity @xmath78 is    @xmath79    the coincidence detection intensity @xmath78 , henceforth referred to simply as `` intensity '' , is the ratio between the measured intensity for a given @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and the intensity measured if @xmath82 .",
    "the expression for @xmath78 in the stokes tensor formalism is @xmath83 where the second term is the interference term .",

    "we ask , given that a [ pi]specific unitary operation @xmath86 has been chosen in the first franson loop , what unitary operation @xmath87 should be chosen in the second franson loop in order to maximize the coincidence intensity ?",
    "we take maximal coincidence intensity as the definition of parallelity between the output of the two short paths and the output of the two long paths .",
    "this maximization procedure is the analogue of the procedure used to define pancharatnam parallelity in the context of a mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite , but here the franson coincidence intensity has taken the role of the mach - zehnder intensity and @xmath81 has taken the role of the @xmath4 phase factor .",
    "it should be noted that if @xmath43 does not have full rank , then there exist @xmath80 such that @xmath88 for all @xmath89 . in this case",

    "lvay s parallelity condition and related parallel transport are defined such that two quaternionic states are parallel if their inner product is a real and positive number .",
    "this condition is in concordance with the mach - zehnder analogue picture since the maximal intensity is achieved when the unit quaternion phase factor @xmath265 is such that @xmath279 is real and positive .",

    "we have constructed a parallel transport procedure in the same spirit as that of pancharatnam @xcite , in the sense that it defines parallelity with reference to maximization of an interferometric quantity .",
    "the interferometric quantity chosen in this case is the coincidence intensity of a franson type interferometer .",
    "the phase is taken to be the local degrees of freedom of one of the subsystems .    given two different two - partite states related by local unitary evolution of one of the subsystems , the unitary operation that needs to be applied to the other subsystem to achieve parallelity , depends on the correlation present in the full bipartite system .",
    "generally phase unitaries that correspond to different parallel transports do not commute , however , when the system is uncorrelated , only abelian phase factors need to be applied .",
    "thus the holonomy group related to the parallel transport condition is abelian if the bipartite state is uncorrelated , and a non - abelian holonomy group can be said to be correlation induced .",
    "the procedure is defined for arbitrary bipartite systems , pure as well as mixed . in the infintesimal limit of the parallel transport , the connection form can be found as a closed expression for arbitrary dimension . on the other hand , finding a closed expression for parallel transport when the steps are finite appears to be non - trivial in the general @xmath304 case .",
    "the procedure can be restricted to subgroups of the full unitary groups . in the pure two - qubit case",
    "when only @xmath0 operators are considered it has been shown that this procedure is related to lvay parallel transport @xcite .",
