    "the main theoretical tool in quantum field theory is presently the perturbation theory .",
    "perturbative calculations provided the majority of the experimentally checked results .",
    "therefore , limits of applicability of perturbative calculations are of considerable interest . on the one hand , there exist processes related to complex vacuum structure in gauge theories and nontrivial classical solutions to field equations which can not be described by perturbation theory . on the other hand , even in the topologically trivial sector at relatively low energies ,",
    "processes which are described poorly by perturbation theory also exist .",
    "perturbative calculations provide reliable results only in weakly coupled models where the expansion parameter  dimensionless coupling constant  is much smaller than unity .",
    "but even in such theories situations are possible in which other competing small ( or large ) parameters exist .",
    "a typical example is a process with large number @xmath1 of particles in the final state ( @xmath1 being of the order of the inverse coupling constant @xmath2 ) .    in conventional perturbation theory even above the topologically trivial vacuum ,",
    "the naive estimate of the amplitude gives the factorial dependence @xmath3 on the multiplicity of the final state .",
    "this enhancement can in principle overcome the suppression due to the powers of the coupling constant . at the tree level",
    ", it is possible to find an exact expression for the amplitude of creation of @xmath1 real particles by one virtual particle in the theory with lagrangian density @xmath4 ( the mass is set equal to one ) in special kinematics , namely , when all particles have zero spatial momenta @xcite , @xmath5 this result points towards complete breakdown of the usual perturbative calculations at @xmath6 because it contradicts unitarity of the theory .    thus , some non - perturbative method is required for the calculation of these cross sections .",
    "the limit we are interested in is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average kinetic energy of the outgoing particles in the centre of mass frame .",
    "existing perturbative calculations @xcite strongly suggest that in this limit the total cross section has the exponential form , @xmath9 this form implies the semiclassical calculability of the cross sections . a method to obtain the exponent @xmath10 in all loops",
    "was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which required solution of a certain classical boundary problem in complex time . at small @xmath11 one needs only to solve purely euclidean equations with special boundary conditions . in conventional perturbative approach",
    "this limit corresponds to the contribution of tree graphs , that gives the following dependence on @xmath12 : @xmath13 let us note that in the domain of its applicability , i.  e. , at @xmath14 , this dependence means the exponential suppression of the cross section , at least if @xmath15 does not become infinite .",
    "but as @xmath11 increases , the function @xmath16 becomes positive and this suppression disappears .",
    "thus , in the latter case one has to take into account loop corrections to @xmath10 which are of the order @xmath17 and higher @xcite .",

    "the corresponding classical solution has singularities on a three - dimensional surface in four - dimensional euclidean space ( in the case of four dimensional theory ) .",
    "this surface depends on @xmath19 and is determined in the course of the calculation . the rayleigh ",

    "are compared to known analytical results in the limiting cases .",
    "let us describe the technique to obtain the exponent for tree cross sections in the limit ( [ lim ] ) @xcite .",
    "we consider the process of the decay of one virtual particle of energy @xmath20 and momentum @xmath21 into @xmath1 real particles in the model with the lagrangian density ( [ action ] ) .",
    "let us write the matrix element @xmath22 in the coherent state representation @xcite , in @xmath23dimensional minkowskian space - time ( @xmath24 is a coherent state ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27 and the boundary terms are @xmath28 where @xmath29 . at the tree level the integral ( [ cohint ] ) is determined by the value of integrand taken at the saddle point .",
    "the extremum conditions for the exponent are the classical field equation @xmath30 and the following boundary conditions : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are arbitrary . at @xmath34",
    "the solution @xmath35 has only positive frequency part .",
    "energy conservation then implies that at @xmath36 the solution should not contain negative frequency parts either , i.  e. , @xmath37 , and the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ cohint ] ) is zero .",
    "thus , the matrix element in the coherent state representation has the form of the fourier component of the saddle point solution , @xmath38 as follows from the coherent state formalism , the tree amplitude of the process @xmath39 can be obtained from the matrix element ( [ ae ] ) in the following way , @xmath40    to find the @xmath1-particle cross section , let us introduce the generating function @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the normalization factor .",

    "let us now determine the constraint on @xmath63 .",
    "it should break the translational invariance .",
    "we have already mentioned that we need the condition on @xmath63 to get rid of the exponential factors in @xmath65 .",
    "let us continue analytically the solution of eq .",
    "( [ cleqns ] ) to the euclidean time .",
    "then the boundary condition ( [ 4 * ] ) and the absence of negative frequency parts , @xmath37 , implies that the solution should decay at @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the euclidean time .",
    "we are not interested in instanton effects , i.  e. , we do not consider classical solutions regular in euclidean space ( in @xmath68 theory there are no such solutions if @xmath69 ) .",
    "then , @xmath70 should be singular somewhere in euclidean space - time . generally , @xmath70 is singular on some surface @xmath71 , where @xmath72 for solutions smooth on the real time axis .",
    "the behaviour of the integral ( [ ae ] ) is determined by singularities of the function @xmath70 , i.  e. , it is proportional to @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are coordinates of the singularity closest to the real axis ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus , to get rid of exponential factors in @xmath46 we need @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "this means , in other words , that we require the singularity surface in euclidean space - time to touch _ approaches _ zero ( @xmath79 at the point @xmath80 ) . ]",
    "the plane @xmath81 at the point @xmath80 , i.  e. , @xmath82 ; @xmath72 at @xmath83 .",
    "this condition simultaneously fixes the translational invariance ( in complex time ) , so it is indeed a constraint fixing zero modes .",
    "so , the problem of finding the tree cross sections at any @xmath20 and @xmath1 can be formulated in euclidean space - time and consists of the following steps :    * find @xmath84-symmetric solutions @xmath85 of the euclidean field equations @xmath86 which is singular on the surface @xmath87 , @xmath88 and has the following asymptotics at @xmath89 : @xmath90 * calculate its frequency components @xmath63 and determine @xmath91 according to eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) . * the functional @xmath91 should then be extremized over variables @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( or , what is the same , over all singularity surfaces of the described type ) , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the tree cross section of the process @xmath39 is then given by the formula ( [ crosssec ] ) .",
    "analytical solutions of this boundary value problem can be found only in special cases ( they will be briefly described in section  [ sec:5 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in numerical computation it is impossible to extremize the functional ( [ w ] ) over infinite dimensional space of singularity surfaces .",
    "one can only make use of rayleigh  ritz procedure , i.  e. , choose some finite dimensional subclass of these surfaces and extremize the functional within this subclass .",
    "let us consider this process more closely .",
    "let the functional @xmath94 reach its minimal value for some @xmath63 : @xmath95 .",
    "let us fix some family of singularity surfaces @xmath96 .",
    "for these surfaces we have @xmath97 for all @xmath92 . after inserting the saddle point value for @xmath93 , equal to @xmath98",
    ", we get @xmath99 comparing @xmath100 and @xmath101 one can obtain the following inequalities : @xmath102 ( in the real computation the second case is realized ) .",
    "thus if we limit ourselves to some subclass of singularity surfaces , we get a lower bound on the exact value of @xmath103 .",
    "the following calculations will be done in @xmath104-dimensional space - time .",
    "we will consider only compact singularity surfaces .",
    "the only requirement imposed on the singularity surface is that it touches the plane @xmath81 at the point @xmath80 and @xmath72 at all other spatial points .",
    "so , we can describe the singularity surface using the following method .",
    "let us choose a sphere of the radius @xmath105 with the centre at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "let the field configuration @xmath106 be infinite at the point @xmath107 , @xmath80 and finite at all points @xmath108 .",
    "then the singularity surface for this field touches the plane @xmath107 at @xmath80 and is contained inside the chosen sphere , i.  e.  at @xmath109 .",
    "this description is suitable for singularity surfaces of the form of a sphere that is slightly squeezed along the horizontal direction .",
    "these configurations are ones of primary interest , as we will see from the results of the calculations .",
    "we should only make the substitution @xmath110 to move the singularity to the origin .",
    "this is equivalent to the following change in frequency components of the field , @xmath111 where @xmath112 are fourier components of the field singular at the point @xmath113 .",
    "as far as the field configuration is @xmath114 symmetric , the field is a function of two variables , @xmath115 , where @xmath93 is the angle between the radius - vector and @xmath67 axis , and @xmath116 is the length of the radius - vector ( in 4-dimensional euclidean space ) .",
    "the euclidean field equations can be obtained by varying the following action : @xmath117 let us make use of the expansion in spherical modes , @xmath118 where @xmath119 are gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "asymptotically , as @xmath120 , the functions @xmath121 are of the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 are modified bessel functions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath112 of the expansion of this field configuration in plain waves are @xmath124 so the integral in eq .",

    "( [ spolar ] ) , we get the expression for the action in terms of the spherical modes .",
    "its extremization yields the equation ( [ eeqns ] ) in terms of radial functions @xmath121 .",
    "the radial functions should have the form ( [ assimpt ] ) at @xmath120 , i.  e. , they should not have growing components .",
    "one also has to impose the second boundary condition which will ensure that the field becomes infinite on some singularity surface , subject to all requirements mentioned in the beginning of this section . to formulate it precisely",
    ", one has to move a bit away from the singularity , i.  e. , the condition @xmath127 should be substituted by the condition @xmath128 , where @xmath129 . in this case",
    "one can neglect the mass term in the field equation near the point @xmath113 and approximate the singularity surface by a plane .",
    "then @xmath106 in this region is @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the distance from the point @xmath132 to the singularity surface .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the singularity is placed at the following distance from the origin , @xmath133    thus , the singularity surface satisfying the required constraints ( its form will be described in more detail later ) is determined by a set of spherical components @xmath134 , which should satisfy the condition @xmath135 i.  e. , @xmath136 ; and also the condition @xmath137 which in the simplest case of two non - zero components @xmath138 is reduced to the requirement that both are non - negative .",
    "the simplest configurations are @xmath139 symmetric .",
    "they are defined in such a way that @xmath140 and @xmath141 for all other @xmath1 , and are characterized by only one parameter , the radius of the singularity surface @xmath142 .",
    "let us extremize over the parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 and singularity surfaces .",
    "making use of eqs .",
    "( [ bkshift ] ) and ( [ ibkbk ] ) , one writes the expression ( [ w ] ) in the following form , @xmath143 where @xmath144 . the stationarity conditions for this expression over @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be easily obtained , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the derivative of the expression ( [ ibkbk ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath147 where @xmath92 should be expressed through @xmath19 by solving the following equation , @xmath148 which is a consequence of eq .  ( [ eextr ] ) .    for calculational reasons it is more convenient to perform the extremization in a slightly different order :",
    "first fix some value of @xmath92 , then find the minimum of @xmath149 over all singularity surfaces ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) and , finally , obtain the corresponding value of @xmath19 from eq .",
    "( [ et ] ) .",
    "let us note that the function @xmath15 is independent of @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , let us make the substitution @xmath150 then eq .  ( [ eeqns ] )",
    "becomes the equation for @xmath151 with @xmath152 , and the integral ( [ ibkbk ] ) transforms into @xmath153 the dependence on @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) disappears .",
    "thus one can set @xmath12 equal to one for the calculation of @xmath15 .    in the case",
    "when @xmath154 ( or , equivalently , @xmath155 ) for all @xmath156 , it is possible to determine the deviation of the singularity surface of the corresponding field configuration from sphere . in this case",
    "the field @xmath106 is large at @xmath157 for all @xmath93 , so in this region we can use the approximation of massless field .",
    "we will also assume that the radius @xmath142 is large enough to consider the singularity surface flat at all points .",
    "then , by making use of eq .",
    "( [ nsing ] ) , we immediately get @xmath158 where @xmath159 characterizes the deviation of the singularity surface from sphere .",
    "the shape of a typical singularity surface found from our calculations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singreal ] .",
    "in the case of @xmath139-symmetric solutions ( one - parameter family of singularity surfaces ) the problem is simple : it is reduced to one ordinary differential equation for @xmath160 .",
    "it is even not necessary to solve the boundary value problem , one can merely fix different values of @xmath161 ( i.  e. , initial conditions at infinite @xmath116 ) and find the corresponding singularity radii @xmath105 .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath15 obtained in this way is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] by a solid line .",
    "if we do not limit ourselves to spherically symmetric modes only , we should , in principle , solve the boundary value problem ( [ eeqns ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to solve it directly because one has to find @xmath162 that rapidly decrease with the harmonic number @xmath1 to have the sum in eq .",
    "( [ ibkbk ] ) convergent ( and this is required at large @xmath116 , where the field itself is small ) .",
    "furthermore , in direct approach the configuration is determined by the shape of the singularity surface , where the values of the field are large , so the problem is extremely unstable .",
    "for the same reason one is unable to solve the boundary value problem formulated in terms of spherical components by fixing @xmath162 at the radius @xmath142 near the singularity .    however , one can invent a method that is similar to one used for the @xmath139-symmetric problem .",
    "let us fix the values of @xmath125 , i.  e. , spherical modes at infinity ( that is equivalent to fixing @xmath63 ) and solve the system of _ ordinary _ differential equations with _ initial _ conditions specified in this way . at some finite radius @xmath142",
    "the field becomes infinite ( more precisely , becomes larger than some prescribed large number @xmath163 ) .",
    "if the coefficients @xmath164 at this @xmath142 obey the conditions ( [ constr1 ] ) and ( [ constr2 ] ) , then this configuration satisfies all requirements mentioned above .",
    "we found that this property is satisfied in a sufficiently large region of parameters @xmath125 , i.  e. , radial functions at infinity .",
    "in particular , one can set all @xmath125 equal to zero for all @xmath165 for any fixed @xmath166 .",
    "the major problem of this method ( and presumably any method that makes use of the expansion in frequency components ) is that the number of spherical modes used for computation is limited .",
    "however , the errors caused by this truncation are significant only at short distances from the singularity ( in the region of strong non - linearity ) and do not lead to a considerable error in the determination of @xmath105 , at least for not too high energies .    to search for the minimum of the @xmath167 as a function of @xmath125 ( that effectively means the minimization over @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) we used the multidimensional downhill simplex method @xcite , that does not require any additional information about the function which is extremized ( i.  e.  it does not need its derivatives ) . to find the minimum , about 50 calculations of @xmath167 had to be made for different configurations .",
    "the calculations were performed with turning on two non - zero spherical modes at infinity , @xmath161 and @xmath168 .",
    "all values of @xmath166 smaller than @xmath169 were explored .",
