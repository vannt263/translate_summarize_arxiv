    "landau - yang theorem @xcite , @xcite , together with the bose - einstein condensation can be viewed as the most spectacular confirmations of bose - einstein statistics for integer - value - spin particles .",
    "landau - yang theorem forbids two photons to participate in any process that would require them to be in a state with total angular momentum one . in the high - energy physics",
    "an evident example is the prohibition the two - photon decay for the neutral spin - one @xmath3-boson .",
    "the same concerns also the annihilation decay of orthopositronium ( also spin-1 state ) .",
    "however both this decays are also forbidden by charge - parity conservation law .",
    "positronium presents a real neutral system ( it coincides with itself after charge conjugation ) , therefore it possesses a definite charge parity @xcite , connected with the total spin value @xmath4 : parapositronium ( @xmath5 ) is charge - positive and orthopositronium ( @xmath6 ) is charge negative .",
    "since the charge parity of a system of @xmath7 photons equals @xmath8 @xcite , parapositronium can not decay into an odd number of ( not necessarily equivalent ) photons and orthopositronium can not decay into an even number of photons .",
    "the @xmath9-boson as a charge - parity - negative particle can not decay into an even number of photons .",
    "a similar situation exists in atomic physics .",
    "already the early calculations of the two - photon decay of the singlet @xmath10 and triplet @xmath11 excited states of the he - like ions to the ground @xmath12 state revealed the crucial difference in the photon frequency distributions in both cases @xcite .",
    "the decay probability for the triplet case tends to zero when the frequencies of the emitted photons are equal ( see fig .",
    "later these conclusions were confirmed within the fully relativistic calculations ( see , for example @xcite ) .    unlike the positronium two - electron ions do not possess a definite charge parity .",
    "the neutral he atom also is not a real neutral particle and also does not have a definite charge parity .",
    "therefore , only the spin - statistic properties can be responsible for this special selection rule .",
    "its connection with the landau - yang theorem and hence with bose - einstein statistics was first emphasized in @xcite where an experimental limit for the violation of the spin - statistic theorem ( sst ) was obtained .",
    "recently this limit was improved in @xcite .",
    "a confirmation of the spin - statistic - selection rules ( sssr ) for two - equal - photon transitions in atomic physics was obtained in @xcite where it was demonstrated that the frequency distributions for the transition rates @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 photons correspond to the type fig .",
    "1 ( right panel ) , while the distributions for the same transition with @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( nonequivalent ) photons belong to the type fig . 1 ( left panel ) . finally in @xcite the sssr - suppressed two - photon transition induced either by the hyperfine interaction or by an external magnetic field were investigated .",
    "the hyperfine interaction changes the value of the total angular momentum @xmath19 of electron state in an atom and in an external magnetic field the angular momentum , in principle , is not conserved .",
    "therefore in both cases the prohibition of the atomic transition @xmath20 with two equivalent photons can be relaxed .",
    "we formulate the sssr for the multi - equal - photon atomic transitions which present an extension of the landau - yang theorem as follows :    \\1 ) sssr-1 : two equivalent photons involved in any atomic transition can have only even values of the total angular momentum @xmath21 ,    \\2 ) sssr-2 : three equivalent dipole photons involved in any atomic transition can have only odd values of the total angular momentum @xmath22 ,    \\3 ) sssr-3 : four equivalent dipole photons involved in any atomic transition can have only even values of the total momentum values @xmath23 .",
    "note that sssr-2 , sssr-3 do not hold , in general , for the photon multipolarity @xmath24 ( see sections iv , v ) .",
    "the landau - yang theorem in case of atomic transitions corresponds to sssr-1 for number of photons @xmath25 and multipolarity @xmath26 involved in the transitions @xmath27 or @xmath28 via the emission or absorption of two photons . in principle",
    ", the original landau - yang theorem does not require that the two photons are equivalent ; it is assumed only that they are not propagating in the same direction , so that one can choose the frame of reference where the center - of - inertia for two photons is at rest .",
    "moreover , originally landau - yang theorem was applied to the processes when the initial particle disappears after decay and is converted to a system of two photons . from the energy - momentum conservation law",
    "it follows that these two photons should be collinear ( opposite direction ) and should have equal frequencies .",
    "the total angular momentum and space parity for these photons were defined in the center - of - inertia rest frame for the two photons .",
    "this frame coincides with the rest frame for decaying particle which disappears after decay ( @xmath9-boson , annihilation decay of orthopositronium ) . for introducing of the sssr for two - photon atomic",
    "decays we employ a different picture ( see section ii ) .",
    "we define the equivalent photons as the photons having the same frequency , angular momentum and parity in the rest frame of a decaying atom . in atomic processes the decaying particle ( atom )",
    "does not disappear in the decay process , therefore the rest frame of an atom does not coincide with the center - of - inertia rest frame for two emitted photons .",
    "the difference in the definitions of the total angular momenta and space parity in both reference frames is important .",
    "the value of the photon orbital angular momentum and therefore the value of the photon total angular momentum depends on the choice of the reference frame .    for all these reasons the sssr-1 which will be proven explicitly in section ii for",
    "the two - photon decay does not fully coincide with the results of the standard landau - yang theorem for the two - photon decay of disappearing particle @xcite-@xcite . in the standard formulation",
    "a two - photon system after decay of an initial ( disappearing ) particle can have any total angular momentum @xmath21 , except @xmath26 .",
    "this result was obtained in the center - of - inertia rest frame for two photons and is not immediately applicable to an arbitrary two - photon decays in he - like ions . according to the sssr-1",
    "no odd values for the total angular momentum are allowed .",
    "thus our sssr-1 in case of two equivalent photons is more restrictive than one could expect from the standard formulation of the landau - yang theorem .",
    "the standard formulation of landau - yang theorem can not be applied also to laser photons : these photons are collinear but have the same direction and the center - of - inertia rest frame does not exist in this case . with our approach",
    "we can consider the absorption of the laser photons in the rest frame of an absorbing atom or ion .",
    "the sssr will work for the absorption transition as well .",
    "though the incident laser photons do not have certain total angular one - photon momentum in the rest frame of an absorbing atom , the fixing of the photon frequency usually defines the initial and final atomic states in the process of absorption .",
    "the total electron angular momenta @xmath19 of the initial and final atomic states then define the total angular momentum for a photon which can be absorbed in this particular transition . in case of multiphoton absorption",
    "the total angular momenta of the absorbed photons are defined by the vector coupling scheme .",
    "apart from the general proof of sssr-1 in case of two - photon decay we support this proof by the direct evaluation of the frequency distribution of transition rate in section ii for the transition @xmath29 , i.e. for the case when the 2-photon system has a total angular momentum @xmath30 .",
    "the transition rate tends to zero when the frequency of both photons are equal .    in section iii",
    "we search for the analogy between the values of a total angular momentum for the system of equivalent photons ( allowed by the sst ) and the values of a total angular momentum for the system of equivalent atomic electrons also allowed by sst , only with the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "section iv contains a detailed derivation of the 3-photon transition rate in highly - charged ions ( hci ) and the proof of sssr-2 for the particular case of 3-photon transition @xmath31 .",
    "the results for the other 3-dipole - photon transitions are also included in this section .",
    "section v contains the analytic proof of the sssr-2 with equations for the coefficients of fractional parentage traditionally used in the theory of atomic spectra for constructing the wave functions for equivalent electrons . in section vi the analytic proof is given dor sssr-3 and the particular examples are provided for the 4-photon transitions which support this proof .",
    "section vii contains discussion and outlook .",
    "a possible experimental test of the results presented in this paper is briefly discussed .",
    "we describe a photon emitted or absorbed by an atom by wave functions @xmath32 or @xmath33 in momentum space , respectively @xcite . here",

    "the index @xmath48 takes only two values @xmath49 , while @xmath50 corresponds to the longitudinal component which is absent for @xmath47 photons .",
    "each component of these wave functions is the eigenstate of the total one - photon angular momentum operator @xmath51 @xmath52    the two - photon wave function for two photons with the same frequency can be constructed as a symmetrized tensor product @xmath53.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here indices 1 , 2 correspond to the two photons , @xmath54 are the total angular momentum for the two - photon system and its projection ; one of the standard notations for the clebsh - gordan coefficient @xmath55 is used .",
    "an explicit expression for the normalization factor @xmath56 is not necessary for our purposes .",
    "the components of the tensor wave function ( [ 3 ] ) are the eigenstates of the total two - photon angular momentum operator @xmath57 and its projection @xmath58 bose - einstein symmetry is already implemented in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) via symmetrization . for the equivalent photons @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "thus , sssr-1 prohibits all the odd values of @xmath0 for two equivalent photons and , consequently the corresponding transitions . according to eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) the two - photon wave function for two equivalent photons always is of even parity .",
    "we should note that description of the properties of a two - photon wave function , close to presented here can be found also in @xcite , as well as similar to our treatment of the landau - yang theorem in atomic processes .",
    "the sssr-1 for @xmath66 two - equal - frequency - photon transition in he - like ions follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) . to illustrate sssr-1 more directly and to support our analytical proof we performed also the evaluation of the transition rate @xmath67 for he - like u ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this evaluation is fully similar to evaluation of @xmath66 transition rate ( see capture to fig .",
    "photon frequency distribution for the two - photon @xmath69 transition is given fig .",
    "2 . the results in fig . 2",
    "demonstrate that sssr-1 prohibits for two equivalent photons emitted in atomic transition to have a total angular momentum @xmath30 . as it was explained in the introduction",
    ", it does not contradict to the `` standard '' formulation of the landau - yang - theorem which allows this value for the two - photon decay of the particle provided that this particle disappears in the process of the decay and the rest system for the center - of - inertia for two photons is employed .",
    "there exists an analogy between the total electron momentum @xmath70 values allowed by the corresponding sssr within @xmath71-coupling scheme ( in this case the spin - statistics is of the fermi - dirac type ) and the total photon momentum values @xmath21 allowed by bose - einstein sssr .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) it follows that the sssr allows for two equivalent electrons also only even values of @xmath70 , exactly as for the equivalent photons .",
    "this happens because in the second term in square brackets in eq .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) , while the values of @xmath87 , unlike the values of @xmath39 , are half - integer .    in case of the number of equivalent electrons",
    "@xmath88 there is no simple way to define the allowed values of the total angular momentum @xmath70 . to determine these values",
    "one has to write down all sets of projections @xmath89 which do not violate the pauli principle .",
    "then for each set the total projection @xmath78 should be defined and all @xmath78 values should be distributed between possible values of @xmath70 .",
    "this is a lengthy procedure ( for example , for @xmath90 and @xmath91 the number of such sets equals to 70 ) which can be only partly simplified with the use of group theory .",
    "the results can be found in books on atomic spectroscopy ( for example @xcite ) and are presented in table 1 . in general , all numbers in this table follow from the pauli principle .",
    "however , if we apply sssr-1 , sssr-3 , etc . for defining the allowed values of @xmath70",
    "we will see that it will work up to @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "it is violated by the presence of @xmath92 for @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "so the sssr-3 for the equivalent electrons is limited by the value @xmath93 .",
    "this should be compared with the limitation of the sssr-2 , sssr-3 etc . by the photon multipolarity @xmath94 .",
    "finally , we should note that the similarity between the systems of equivalent photons and equivalents electrons could be made more close with the use of the matrix form of maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "for photon numbers @xmath95 the sssr can be formulated only for dipole photons . for 3-dipole - photon transitions we can give few examples which prove the validity of sssr-2 for @xmath96 . in this section we present a detailed derivation for this proof .",
