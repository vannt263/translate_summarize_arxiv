    "large amplitude millisecond oscillations have now been observed during thermonuclear x - ray bursts from six low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) ( see strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ; smith , morgan & bradt 1997 , zhang _ et al .",

    "the thermonuclear instability which triggers an x - ray burst burns in a few seconds the nuclear fuel which has been accumulated on the neutron star surface over several hours .",
    "this @xmath1 10@xmath2 difference between the accumulation and burning timescales means that it is extremely unlikely that the conditions required to trigger the instability will be achieved simultaneously over the entire stellar surface .",
    "this realization , first emphasized by joss ( 1978 ) , led to the study of lateral propagation of the burning instability over the neutron star surface ( see fryxell & woosley 1982 , nozakura , ikeuchi & fujimoto 1984 , and bildsten 1995 ) .",
    "the subsecond risetimes of thermonuclear x - ray bursts suggests that convection plays an important role in the physics of the burning front propagation , especially in the low accretion rate regime which leads to large ignition columns ( see bildsten ( 1998 ) for a review of thermonuclear burning on neutron stars ) .",
    "bildsten ( 1995 ) has shown that pure helium burning on neutron star surfaces is in general inhomogeneous , displaying a range of behavior which depends on the local accretion rate .",
    "low accretion rates lead to convectively combustible accretion columns and standard type i bursts , while high accretion rates lead to slower , nonconvective propagation which may be manifested in hour long flares .",
    "these studies emphasize that the physics of thermonuclear burning is necessarily a multi - dimensional problem and that _ localized _ burning is to be expected , especially at the onset of bursts .",
    "there is now good evidence that the oscillations seen during the rising phase of bursts from 4u 1728 - 34 are produced by spin modulation of such a localized thermonuclear hotspot on the surface of the neutron star , and that the observed oscillation frequency is a direct measure of the neutron star spin frequency ( see strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ) .",
    "these observations provide the most compelling evidence to date that neutron stars in lmxb are rotating with near millisecond periods .",
    "in this letter we present new burst data from the lmxb 4u 1636 - 54 which provides further evidence in support of the spin modulation hypothesis for the millisecond burst oscillations .",
    "we present data from a thermonuclear burst from 4u 1636 - 54 which reveals a strong transient oscillation during the burst rise at 1.723 ms with an initial amplitude of @xmath0 .",
    "we also discuss the implications of these findings for the spin modulation interpretation and how they can be used to place constraints on the mass and radius of neutron stars .",
    "finally , we discuss some implications of our observations for the current theories of kilohertz quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpo ) in lmxb .",
    "zhang _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) reported the discovery of 581 hz oscillations during several thermonuclear x - ray bursts from 4u 1636 - 54 . here",
    "we focus on a single burst detected from this source with rxte at 22:39:22 utc on december 28 , 1996 .",
    "this burst is unique in that it reveals strong oscillations at 581 hz _",
    "prior _ to the onset of photospheric radius expansion .",
    "oscillations are not detected during the photospheric expansion phase , but reappear with much weaker amplitude after photospheric touchdown in a manner very similar to that reported for bursts from 4u1728 - 34 and ks 1731 - 26 ( strohmayer _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; and smith , morgan , & bradt 1997 ) .    for this burst we obtained event mode data with 125 @xmath3s ( 1/8192 s ) time resolution and 64 spectral channels across the 2 - 100 kev pca bandpass .",
    "this data mode employs a pair of data buffers which are alternately read out after a selectable accumulation interval . each buffer can store @xmath4 16,000 events . in the case",
    "that the source countrate is high enough to fill the buffer before the end of an accumulation interval gaps in the data can occur . for the event data shown here we did have short gaps when the burst flux was high , but telemetry constraints preclude selecting a shorter accumulation interval .",
    "for these bursts we also had 125 @xmath3s , 2 - 90 kev binnned timing data which does not suffer from gaps .",
    "at the time of the burst in question the persistent countrate from 4u1636 - 54 in the total pca bandpass was about 2100 cts / sec .",
    "4u1636 - 54 is classified as an atoll source and it was in the so called banana branch during these observations ( see hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "we will present more detailed analysis of the accretion driven flux and properties of all the x - ray bursts observed in a subsequent paper .",
    "figure 1 shows the 2 - 90 kev pca lightcurve ( top ) and the hardness ratio ( 6 - 18 kev)/(2 - 6 kev ) at 1/16 s resolution for this burst .",
    "the drop in the hardness ratio at about 1.5 s is a clear indication of photospheric radius expansion .",
    "this burst had a peak flux in the 2 - 60 kev band of @xmath5 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath7 and a fluence in the same band of @xmath8 ergs @xmath6 . at the system s probable distance of 6.5 kpc ( see lawrence _ et al .",
    "_ 1983 ) these correspond to @xmath9 ergs s@xmath7 and @xmath10 ergs .",
    "we used the 2 - 90 kev , 125 @xmath3s binned data to compute a dynamic power spectrum by calculating power spectra from 2 s of data every 1/8 s through the burst .",
    "since the data overlap in this analysis the individual power spectra are not independent , however , this procedure provides a straightforward way to investigate the time evolution of the oscillations .",
    "the resulting dynamic power spectrum is presented in figure 2 , which shows contours of constant power spectral amplitude along with the burst profile superposed .",
    "this analysis reveals the presence of strong oscillations at about 580 hz on the rising edge of the burst as well as oscillations after photospheric touchdown at a frequency about 1 hz higher .",
    "as we discuss below , the oscillations during the rise are transient , lasting about 0.25 s , this introduces a characteristic width to the peak in the power spectrum which results in the broader distribution in frequency of the power spectral contours near the burst rise .",
    "we emphasize that the contours centered near 580.5 hz at about 2 s are not indicative of a real drop in the oscillation frequency at the burst onset .",
    "however , the change in frequency from burst rise to post - peak is real and is not caused by finite sampling time effects or the transient nature of the oscillations .",
    "this trend for the oscillation frequency to increase with time during some bursts has now been reported in all sources with millisecond burst oscillations except ks1731 - 26 , from which only a single burst with oscillations has so far been detected ( see strohmayer _",
    "_ 1997 ; smith , morgan , & bradt 1997 ) .    to further characterize the oscillations seen during the rising phase we performed an epoch folding period search on the rising interval .",
    "figure 3 shows the lightcurve of the burst , focusing on the rising portion .",
    "the interval used for this analysis is denoted by the dashed lines in figure 3 .",
    "the epoch folding reveals a strong oscillation at 1.723 ms .",
    "we folded the data on this period to determine the pulse profile and amplitude .",
    "the resulting pulse profile is shown in figure 4a .",
    "we fit a model with a constant countrate plus a sinusoid , @xmath11 , to the pulse profile and find an amplitude @xmath12 with an acceptable fit . since there is no evidence that the persistent flux component is oscillating at the frequency observed during the burst , to determine the pulsed amplitude we first subtracted from the folded lightcurve the average persistent countrate calculated from a 20 s interval prior to the burst .",
    "we note that there are no detectable oscillations during the interval when the drop in hardness ratio at about 1.5 s ( see figure 1 ) indicates the onset of photospheric radius expansion .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the expansion of the photosphere destroys the coherent oscillations , probably both by scattering away the amplitude as well as changing the frequency quickly via the expansion of the surface layers .",
    "after photospheric touchdown ( see figure 1 at about 3.5 s ) the oscillations are again detected , but with slightly higher frequency and a much lower amplitude of about 5.7 % in the 2 - 60 kev bandpass .",
    "the presence of large amplitude oscillations very near the onset of this burst is similar to the behavior of bursts from 4u 1728 - 34 reported by strohmayer , zhang & swank ( 1997 ) .",
    "we found even higher oscillation amplitudes by folding a 62 ms interval close to the onset of the burst .",
    "the folded interval is denoted by the solid vertical lines in figure 3 .",
    "the background subtracted folded lightcurve obtained from this 62 ms interval is shown in figure 4b .",
    "we again fit the sinusoidal model to this lightcurve and found an amplitude of @xmath0 for this interval .",
    "this is easily the largest amplitude of the 581 hz oscillation seen during this burst .",
    "such a large amplitude  almost the entire thermal burst flux is modulated  only about 0.1 s after the onset of the burst is strong evidence that we are seeing a rotationally modulated , thermonuclear hotspot .",
    "strohmayer , zhang & swank ( 1997 ) reported spectral evidence for an increasing x - ray emitting area during burst rise using bursts from 4u 1728 - 34 observed with rxte .",
    "we performed similar spectral analysis in order to determine whether the same process is plausible for this burst as an explanation for the strong oscillations seen during the rise . using the 125 @xmath3s , 64 channel data we accumulated spectra through the burst on either 0.0625 , 0.125 , 0.25 or 0.5 s intervals depending on the countrate .",
    "we also accumulated a 20 s interval just prior to the burst for use as a background estimate .",
    "we fit the background subtracted spectra to a blackbody model to determine temperatures and fluxes as a function of time through the burst .",
    "we created a plot of @xmath13 versus @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the bolometric flux and @xmath15 is the blackbody temperature in kev .",
    "for a true blackbody the quantity @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the x - ray emitting area and @xmath18 is the distance to the source .",
    "we found results very similar to those reported by strohmayer , zhang & swank ( 1997 ) for bursts from 4u 1728 - 34 , that is , @xmath19 increases during the rise .",
    "this is strong evidence for an expanding x - ray emission region and thus supports the spin modulation hypothesis in this burst from 4u 1636 - 54 .",
    "we emphasize that this result suggests an increase in the x - ray emitting area _",
    "prior _ to the onset of photospheric radius expansion .",
    "the onset of photospheric radius expansion is reflected in the drop in hardness ratio at about 1.5 s in figure 1",
    ". it also corresponds to an increase in the emitting surface area , but it is caused by _",
    "expansion of the photosphere due to radiation forces and not the _ lateral _ propagation of the burning instability .",
    "the blackbody spectral analysis indicates that the inferred emitting areas were approximately the same both immediately before and after the photospheric radius expansion .",
    "this result combined with the large difference in oscillation amplitudes before and after photospheric expansion suggests that the thermonuclear flash covered the entire surface of the neutron star .",
    "if the millisecond oscillations seen during bursts are in fact due to spin modulation , then detailed study and modelling of the oscillation amplitudes , pulse profiles and spectral variability with pulse phase during x - ray bursts can provide a wealth of information on the mass and radius of the neutron star .",
    "for example , the maximum modulation amplitude that can be obtained from a hotspot of a given angular size on a rotating neutron star is set by the strength of general relativistic light bending .",
    "for the case that rotation is not rapid enough to substantially distort the exterior spacetime from the schwarzchild spacetime , and this is the case even for spin periods of a few milliseconds ( lamb & miller 1995 ) , then the maximum amplitude depends only on the compactness of the neutron star , that is , the ratio of stellar mass to radius @xmath20 .",
    "stars which are more compact produce lower amplitudes due to flattening of the pulse by light bending ( see pechenick , ftaclas & cohen 1983 ; strohmayer 1992 ; and miller & lamb 1997 ) . since the intrinsic rotational modulation amplitude can only be decreased by other effects such as photon scattering ( see miller , lamb & psaltis 1997 ; brainerd & lamb 1987 ; and kylafis & phinney 1989 ) or the viewing geometry of the spot , the maximum observed oscillation amplitude represents a lower limit to the intrinsic amplitude .",
    "thus an observed amplitude can be used to place an upper limit on the compactness of the neutron star , that is , if the star were more compact than some limit it would not be able to produce a modulation amplitude as large as that observed .    in principle ,",
    "stellar rotation will also play a role in the observed properties of spin modulation pulsations .",
    "for example , assuming the oscillation frequency of 581 hz represents the spin frequency of the neutron star in 4u 1636 - 54 , then for a 10 km radius neutron star the spin velocity is @xmath21 at the rotational equator .",
    "the motion of the hotspot produces a doppler shift of magnitude @xmath22 , thus the observed spectrum is a function of pulse phase ( see chen & shaham 1989 ) .",
    "measurement of a pulse phase dependent doppler shift in the x - ray spectrum would provide additional evidence supporting the spin modulation model and would also provide a means of constraining the neutron star radius .",
    "the rotationally induced velocity also produces an aberration which results in asymmetric pulses , thus the pulse shapes also contain information on the spin velocity and therefore the stellar radius ( chen & shaham 1989 ) .",
    "the component of the spin velocity along the line of site is proportional to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the lattitude of the hotspot measured with respect to the rotational equator .",
    "the modulation amplitude also depends on the lattitude of the hotspot , as spots near the rotational poles produce smaller amplitudes than those at the equator .",
    "thus we expect a correlation between the observed oscillation amplitude and the size of any pulse phase dependent doppler shift .",
    "dectection of such a correlation in a sample of bursts would definitively confirm the rotational modulation model in our opinion .",
    "we will present calculations of mass - radius constraints for 4u 1636 - 54 and 4u 1728 - 34 including the effects of light bending , rotation and angle dependent emission , based on the observed properties of burst oscillations as well as spectroscopy of eddington limited bursts in a subsequent paper .",
    "several models for the kilohertz qpo seen in 13 lmxb systems ( see van der klis 1997 for a recent review ) invoke some sort of beat - frequency interpretation for the twin khz peaks seen in many of the sources ( see miller , lamb & psaltis 1997 ; strohmayer _ et al .",
    "so far only in 4u 1728 - 34 does the frequency difference between the twin khz peaks match the frequency observed during x - ray bursts ( see strohmayer _",
    "in two other sources ( ks 1731 - 26 and 4u 1636 - 54 ) the separation of the twin khz peaks is closer to 1/2 the frequency of oscillations observed during bursts ( see wijnands & van der klis 1997 ; and zhang _ et al .",
    "for example , wijnands _",
    "( 1997 ) report a frequency difference for the twin khz qpo in 4u1636 - 54 of @xmath25 hz .",
    "the effort to reconcile these observations with a beat - frequency interpretation has led to speculation that the oscillation frequency observed during bursts may sometimes be twice the spin frequency of the star , although in 4u1636 - 54 the difference frequency appears to be a bit less than 1/2 the burst oscillation frequency , and in some z sources the frequency difference is not constant ( van der klis _",
    "if this scenario is correct it implies the existence of two antipodal spots on the neutron star surface during x - ray bursts .",
    "in addition to the daunting requirement of initiating the thermonuclear flash nearly simultaneously on opposite sides of the neutron star , the observation of large oscillation amplitudes shortly after burst onset in 4u1636 - 54 places severe constraints on the two hotspot scenario . to see this",
    "one can ask the following question .",
    "what maximum amplitude can be produced by a star with antipodal hotspots ?",
    "for two antipodal spots light bending strongly constrains the amplitudes that can be achieved ( see pechenick , ftaclas & cohen 1983 ) .",
    "calculations using the schwarzchild spacetime and isotropic emission from the stellar surface indicate that even a neutron star with an implausibly small compactness of @xmath26 , recall that rotational modulation amplitude increases with decreasing compactness , can only achieve a maximum amplitude of about 30 % , whereas we measured an amplitude of 75% from the burst described here .",
    "we note that with @xmath26 a 1.4 @xmath27 neutron star would have a radius of 21 km .",
    "this is far stiffer than any neutron star equation of state that we are familiar with .",
    "rapid rotation could in principle modify this result , but at the modest inferred spin period of 290.5 hz for the two spots to produce the observed 581 hz frequency one would still require implausibly large neutron star radii to make a significant rotational correction to the amplitude .",
    "another process which can increase the amplitude is beaming of radiation at the stellar surface .",
    "for example , to the extent that electron scattering is the dominant opacity process in neutron star atmospheres then one should expect a specific intensity distribution which approximates that from a grey atmosphere .",
    "such a distribution is proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the angle from the normal to the stellar surface ( see mihalas 1978 ) , so this will modestly increase the rotational modulation amplitude .",
    "in addition , it is likely that the emergent spectrum will also be a weak function of @xmath29 ( miller & lamb 1997 ) . with more detailed modelling of the emission from hotspots of finite size it will be possible to place strong constraints on the antipodal hotspot interpretation for the burst oscillations . finally , if further analysis such as pulse phase spectroscopy continues to support the interpretation of the burst oscillation frequency as the neutron star spin frequency in 4u1636 - 54 , then khz qpo frequency separations near 1/2 the spin frequency would suggest that the beat frequency interpretation may be untenable .",
