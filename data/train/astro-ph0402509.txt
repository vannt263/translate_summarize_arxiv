    "the targets for observational studies of young stars and brown dwarfs are selected from surveys for members of nearby star - forming regions .",
    "the masses for these targets are typically estimated by measuring their spectral types and interpreting their positions on a hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram with theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "thus , the success of work on young stars and brown dwarfs relies on clear evidence of membership and accurate spectral classifications for putative members of star - forming populations .    at a distance of 160 - 170  pc @xcite ,",
    "the chamaeleon  i cloud complex is one of the nearest major sites of active star formation .",
    "a variety of methods have been used to identify members of chamaeleon  i , including monitoring of photometric variability at optical @xcite and infrared ( ir ) @xcite wavelengths , objective prism spectroscopy at h@xmath5 @xcite , x - ray imaging with the _ einstein observatory _ @xcite and the _ rntgen satellite _ @xcite , and near- to mid - ir photometry from ground - based telescopes @xcite , the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ @xcite , and the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ @xcite . to measure spectral types and to check for signatures of youth and membership in the resulting candidate members ,",
    "spectroscopy was employed by those authors and in subsequent followup work @xcite .",
    "although chamaeleon  i has been the target of a large number of studies , many of the objects that have been referred to as members of the cluster lack either conclusive evidence of membership or accurate spectral classifications . in addition , many of the candidates from recent surveys have not been observed with spectroscopy . to address these shortcomings in the current census of chamaeleon  i , i present optical spectroscopy for most of the objects that have been previously identified as possible members of the cluster , that lack either accurate spectral classifications or evidence of membership , and that are sufficiently bright ( @xmath0 ) (   [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "i then measure spectral types from these data and use all available constraints to evaluate the membership status of most of the candidate members of chamaeleon  i that have appeared in previous work (   [ sec : class ] ) .",
    "the implications of this new census for recent searches for members of the cluster are described (   [ sec : imp ] ) . finally , i estimate extinctions , luminosities , and effective temperatures for the known members and use these data to construct an h - r diagram for chamaeleon  i (   [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "most of the sources toward chamaeleon  i that are discussed here have multiple identifications from published surveys . in this work ,",
    "i use the names adopted by @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive list of cross identifications was provided in that study .    through near - ir",
    "photometric monitoring of a @xmath6 area toward chamaeleon  i , @xcite recently discovered 10 objects that exhibited variability or excess emission that were suggestive of youth and membership in the star - forming region .",
    "i obtained spectra for nine of these sources .",
    "the remaining object , chsm  17388 , was not detected by the optical guide camera and therefore was not observed .",
    "in addition to these candidates , @xcite compiled astrometry , near - ir photometry , and membership information for most of the potential members reported in previous studies .",
    "i selected for spectroscopy 147 of these objects , which included all of the optically visible sources ( @xmath0 ) that lacked either accurate spectral types or conclusive evidence of membership . in their compilation",
    ", @xcite excluded most of the candidates reported by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "table  [ tab : log ] summarizes long - slit optical spectroscopy of the 179 targets in chamaeleon  i from the previous section and a sample of standard stars for spectral classification .",
    "these observations were performed with the boller and chivens spectrograph ( b&c ) and the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss-2 ) on the magellan  i and ii 6.5  m telescopes at las campanas observatory .",
    "the b&c spectra with the 600 and 1200  l  mm@xmath7 gratings covered 6000 - 9200 and 6200 - 7800   , respectively , while the data from ldss-2 covered 4800 - 9200   .",
    "all data were obtained with the slit rotated to the parallactic angle .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 10 to 1200  s. after bias subtraction and flat - fielding , the spectra were extracted and calibrated in wavelength with arc lamp data .",
    "the data were corrected for the sensitivity functions of the detectors , which were measured from observations of spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "when available , @xmath8 measurements from the denis second release were used to flux calibrate the spectra that extended to 9200   .",
    "these calibrated spectra were then taken as flux standards for the 13 sources that lacked @xmath8 data .",
    "the higher - resolution spectra at 6200 - 7800    were calibrated by scaling them to the low - resolution data .",
    "the portions of the 600  l  mm@xmath7 data that encompass h@xmath5 and li are shown in figure  [ fig : li ] .",

    "[ fig : fb1]-[fig : fb5 ] .",
    "all spectra are available from the author upon request .",
    "in this section , i measure spectral types for the 179 candidate members of chamaeleon  i that have been observed spectroscopically in this work .",
    "i also use spectra from @xcite to classify the four candidates from that study that were not included in my spectroscopic sample .",
    "low - resolution red optical spectra of early - type dwarfs and giants are characterized by absorption in the ca  ii triplet , h@xmath5 , and a blend of transitions near 6500   . at types earlier than mid k , i measured spectral types by comparing the strengths the latter two features to those in the standard dwarfs and giants from @xcite and this work .",
    "although the ca  ii transitions are sensitive to surface gravity , i did not use them to assign luminosity classes because few of the available standard giant spectra encompassed these lines .    at types later than mid k , h@xmath5 disappears and the tio , cah , and vo absorption bands rapidly become stronger with later spectral types .",
    "the strengths of these bands and the k  i , na  i , and ca  ii absorption lines differ noticeably among dwarfs , giants , and pre - main - sequence objects @xcite , particularly at later types .",
    "these molecular and atomic features were used to measure spectral types and luminosity classes through a comparison to data for dwarfs and giants obtained in this work and from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the spectral types of the members of chamaeleon  i were derived by comparisons to dwarfs and averages of dwarfs and giants for types @xmath9m5 and @xmath10m5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the typical precision of the optical spectral types is @xmath11 and @xmath12 for k and m types , respectively , unless noted otherwise . for the chamaeleon  i members that exhibit intense emission lines , such as t14a , t44 , and t42 , strong blue excess continuum emission",
    "also may be present , which would weaken the observed absorption bands and thus imply types that are too early . to mitigate the effects of veiling ,",
    "the spectral types for these sources are based primarily on the reddest absorption bands ( @xmath108000   ) where any excess continuum emission should be weakest .",
    "i now use the spectroscopic data in this work and all available constraints from the literature to evaluate the membership status of the potential members of chamaeleon  i that have been presented in previous surveys . in the following analysis",
    ", i consider all of the candidate members compiled by @xcite , the 10 new candidates from @xcite , the additional candidates from @xcite and @xcite that i included in my spectroscopic sample (   [ sec : targets ] ) , and the candidates observed spectroscopically by @xcite .",
    "i also examine various sources that have been identified as likely field stars in previous studies within a radius of @xmath13 from @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( j2000 ) , a few which will be classified as members of chamaeleon  i. a total of 288 objects are evaluated .",
    "stars projected against the chamaeleon  i clouds can be background stars , foreground stars , or young members of the star - forming region . following @xcite ,",
    "i employ several diagnostics to distinguish between these possibilities , including proper motions , radial velocities , trigonometric parallaxes , luminosity classifications , reddenings , positions on an h - r diagram , and signatures of newly formed stars ( emission lines , li absorption , ir excess emission ) .",
    "although x - ray observations are useful in selecting candidate young stars , i do not take x - ray emission as evidence of membership as it can arise from both active field stars and cluster members .",
    "i next describe each of these diagnostics .",
    "additional comments on individual sources are in ",
    "[ sec : append ] .",
    "the membership of a star can be examined by comparing its proper motion , radial velocity , and parallax to the values of the known cluster members .",
    "if any one of these measurements differs significantly from the cluster mean , then it can be confidently identified as a field star . on the other hand , consistency with the mean cluster values supports membership but",
    "does not guarantee it ( e.g. , t19 ,   [ sec : append ] ) . because of the low accuracies of most of the published measurements of proper motions and parallaxes in chamaeleon  i , i consider them in this work only when no other membership constraints are available .    in the previous section",
    ", i spectroscopically determined the luminosity classes for a large number of sources , primarily the ones at m spectral types .",
    "these classes consist of dwarfs , giants , and pre - main - sequence objects , and thus differentiate between field stars and young cluster members .",
    "other constraints on membership include a star s reddening and position on the h - r diagram .",
    "if a star exhibits significant reddening in its spectrum or colors ( @xmath16 ) , then it can not be a field star in the foreground of the cluster .",
    "meanwhile , if a star is clearly not a giant by its spectrum and it appears above the main sequence for the distance of chamaeleon  i , then it can not be a background field star .",
    "objects that are neither foreground stars nor background stars must be members of the cluster .    because young stars are associated with processes such as accretion and outflows , members of star - forming regions often exhibit strong emission lines , examples of which at optical wavelengths include h@xmath5 , he  i , ca  ii , and various forbidden transitions .",
    "however , chromospherically active field stars also can produce emission in h@xmath5 and other permitted lines .",
    "therefore , emission lines comprise evidence of youth and membership in a star - forming cluster only if they are stronger than the lines found in field dwarfs . for the case of h@xmath5 ,",
    "i have selected a boundary that approximates the upper limit of emission strengths observed in field dwarfs in the diagram of log  @xmath17(h@xmath5 ) versus spectral type in figure  [ fig : ha ] @xcite .",
    "only data above that line are taken as evidence of membership . for sources that were observed spectroscopically in this work and that are classified as members of chamaeleon  i in this section , table  [ tab : ha ] lists the equivalent widths and fluxes of h@xmath5 that i measured from the spectra .",
    "the line fluxes were combined with the bolometric luminosities from   [ sec : teff ] to arrive at log  @xmath18 for each source .",
    "these measurements of log  @xmath17(h@xmath5 ) and log  @xmath18 are plotted in figure  [ fig : ha ] .",
    "the adopted threshold for identifying a young star via h@xmath5 emission is fairly conservative ; a field dwarf could be mistaken as a young star only if it exhibited an unusually intense flare .",
    "in fact , for all of the sources above the boundary in figure  [ fig : ha ] , membership is supported by at least one other diagnostic in this section .",
    "in addition to h@xmath5 , detections of emission in forbidden optical transitions or ir lines were taken as evidence of youth as well .",
    "after the formation of a low - mass star , convection and nuclear burning steadily deplete li at its stellar surface over time . as a result , li absorption is stronger in young stars than in their older counterparts in the field .",
    "the change in li strength with age is particularly large at m spectral types , where the equivalent widths vary from 0.45 - 0.8    at 1  myr in taurus @xcite to nearly zero at 30  myr in ic  2602 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , for stars at earlier types , the initial li absorption is weaker and the species is not fully depleted even at 100  myr , resulting in a smaller change in observed li strengths with time and reducing the effectiveness of li as a youth diagnostic at types earlier than k0 .",
    "therefore , as with emission lines , li absorption is evidence of membership only if the equivalent width is greater than the maximum values for the youngest field stars ( @xmath19  myr ) at a given spectral type . in this comparison , young field stars can be represented by members of the pleiades and ic  2602 open clusters @xcite .",
    "the strength of li can be significantly overestimated in low - resolution data because of blending with nearby fe lines @xcite .",
    "the highest resolution of 3    obtained in this work should provide sufficiently accurate measurements @xcite , particularly at the late - k and m types of most of the targets observed at that setting .",
    "these spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : li ] , where the young members of chamaeleon  i are readily distinguished from old field dwarfs and giants via li .",
    "the li measurements for the objects observed at high resolution and classified as members are provided in table  [ tab : li ] .",
    "as with emission lines and li absorption , emission from cool circumstellar material in excess above that from the photosphere of the central star is a signature of youth that can establish the membership of an object . with longer ir wavelengths ,",
    "these excesses become larger and produce colors that are distinctive from those of field stars . for instance , figure  [ fig : iso1 ] presents 6.7 and 14.3  _ iso _ photometry @xcite for stars that are determined to be members and field stars by the previous diagnostics in this section and for the remaining stars that lack the data for those diagnostics . in a diagram of this kind ,",
    "field stars are well - separated from the young stars that exhibit ir excesses @xcite .",
    "therefore , a color of @xmath20 is taken as evidence of membership in this work .",
    "meanwhile , as shown in the next section , most young stars are not unambiguously distinguished from field stars through colors at shorter ir wavelengths . in this work ,",
    "only excesses measured at @xmath21  are used to establish youth .",
    "i have applied the above membership diagnostics to all relevant data from the literature for the 288 sources considered here .",
    "for the 158 objects classified as members of chamaeleon  i through this analysis , astrometry and photometry are listed in table  [ tab : mem1 ] and spectral types and membership evidence are listed in table  [ tab : mem2 ] .",
    "t33a and b are combined into one entry in these lists but are otherwise counted separately in this work .",
    "the membership for 41 of these sources is based on data collected in this work alone .",
    "tables  [ tab : fore ] and [ tab : back ] contain similar data for the 13 foreground stars and 91 background sources , respectively .",
    "the membership of the 26 stars listed in table  [ tab : unc ] can not be determined with the available data .",
    "i have adopted @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 measurements from the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog and @xmath8 from the deep near - ir survey of the southern sky ( denis ) second release . when multiple @xmath8 measurements were listed for a given star in the latter database ,",
    "the average of those value has been adopted . for 30 of the stars that do not have @xmath8 in the denis second release ,",
    "i have adopted the preliminary denis data from @xcite .",
    "most of these stars are within two areas that are not in the denis second release , which are defined approximately by @xmath25 to @xmath26 and @xmath27 to @xmath28 ( j2000 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : map ] , the positions of the members of chamaeleon  i are plotted with the extinction map from @xcite .",
    "definitive membership classifications are not possible for the sources in table  [ tab : unc ] .",
    "the following methods can identify some of these objects as either candidate members or candidate field stars .    although the contrast of cool circumstellar material against a stellar photosphere is lower at shorter wavelengths , excess emission from the former is still detectable in colors at 1 - 10  . in figure",
    "[ fig : iso2 ] , i plot the objects classified as members and as field stars in the previous section in a diagram of @xmath29 versus @xmath30 .",
    "the overlap between young stars and field stars is greater than in the diagram based on longer - wavelength photometry in figure  [ fig : iso1 ] , but this may be partially due to erroneous measurements .",
    "for instance , the two reddest field stars in @xmath29 , iso  145 and chxr  22w , are only @xmath31 and @xmath32 from stars that are brighter at @xmath24 by 1.9 and 2.5 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "the 6.7  measurements for iso  145 and chxr  22w may have been contaminated by emission from these nearby stars , which would result in false excesses at 6.7  relative to the 2mass bands . at any rate , upon inspection of figure  [ fig : iso2 ] , i find that one of the unclassified stars , iso  206 , may have a modest excess in @xmath29 and thus is a potential member of chamaeleon  i. a similar exercise is performed with the diagram of @xmath33 versus @xmath34 in figure  [ fig : jhhk ] .",
    "i plot the standard dwarf colors from @xcite ( @xmath9m0 ) and from the young disk populations in @xcite ( @xmath10m0 ) .",
    "the former are transformed from the johnson - glass photometric system to the cit system @xcite , which is equivalent to the 2mass system at a level of @xmath35  mag @xcite .",
    "three of the objects with undetermined membership , ots  7 , 32 , and 44 , are on the right side of the reddening vector for m6.5 dwarfs and thus appear to have ir excesses that are indicative of youth .",
    "although the 2mass data that are used for these three sources have large uncertainties , they do support the presence of excesses originally reported by @xcite .",
    "young stars are not the only sources that exhibit colors redward of the reddening band of main sequence stars , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : jhhk ] by chsm  11564 ( seyfert galaxy ) and iras  11248 - 7653 ( mira variable ) .",
    "a color - magnitude diagram composed of optical and near - ir photometry is another useful tool in distinguishing candidate members of a young cluster from likely field stars .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , i select extinction - corrected @xmath36 and @xmath23 for the color - magnitude diagram of the objects considered here . in those previous studies , the extinction for a given star",
    "was computed by dereddening its position in a diagram of @xmath34 versus @xmath37 until it intersected the sequence defined by field m dwarfs . however ,",
    "if a star exhibits a very large @xmath38-band excess , this procedure will overestimate its extinction .",
    "therefore , in this work , if @xmath33 is more than 0.1  mag greater than the reddening vector for m9  v , then the extinction is instead computed from @xmath34 assuming an intrinsic color of 0.9 , which is a typical intrinsic value for a young star with a large excess @xcite .",
    "this dereddening method used here and by @xcite and @xcite requires no knowledge of spectral types or membership and can be applied uniformly to photometry to better separate cluster members from field stars in a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "more accurate extinctions for the confirmed cluster members will be estimated in   [ sec : ext ] by incorporating the spectral type measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : ik ] contains the extinction - corrected diagram of @xmath36 versus @xmath23 for members , field stars , and unclassified sources .",
    "the members of chamaeleon  i form a well - defined sequence , the lower envelope of which has been outlined by the boundary plotted in figure  [ fig : ik ] .",
    "iso  225 is the only known member that appears below this boundary .",
    "it is anomalously faint for its spectral type in an h - r diagram as well (   [ sec : hr ] ) .",
    "three of the six unclassified sources for which @xmath8 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are available , cam2 - 12 , cam2 - 14 , and ots  61 , are below the sequence of members and therefore are probably field stars .",
    "cam2 - 35/chsm  17388 , is outside the limits of figure  [ fig : ik ] and is below the sequence as well , but its optical and ir measurements are uncertain because of nebulosity .",
    "cam2 - 18 is a marginal candidate by its position just above the boundary in figure  [ fig : ik ] .",
    "c1 - 14 is the other star above the boundary and thus is a possible member (   [ sec : append ] ) .",
    "in the previous section , i measured spectral types for 179 objects toward chamaeleon  i. i then used these spectra and published data to identify 158 members of chamaeleon  i , 104 non - members , and 26 sources that could not be classified in a sample of 288 potential members from previous studies . among the members , 137 , 8 , and 13 objects",

    ", @xcite recently presented near - ir spectra of 46 candidate members of chamaeleon  i that were found in various previous surveys .",

    "two stars exhibited strong absorption in br@xmath39 and were classified as earlier than m0 .",
    "for the remaining 29 sources , @xcite estimated spectral types from the steam absorption bands .",
    "they then proceeded to treat these objects as members of chamaeleon  i , placing them on the h - r diagram and estimating their masses and ages .",
    "however , the only evidence of membership in chamaeleon  i that was presented by @xcite consisted of emission line detections in two stars .",
    "otherwise , they failed to demonstrate that the other targets were members rather than field stars through their spectroscopy or any other means . indeed , on the surface , the simple fact that no field stars were reported among 13 and 29 candidates observed by @xcite and @xcite is surprising .",
    "based on the optical spectra in the previous section , i find that 12 of the 29 targets from the latter study are in fact background stars , most of which are clearly field giants .",
    "these results are consistent with the spectra in @xcite , which i have been able to classify through visual inspection since giants are readily distinguished from young stars with @xmath38-band spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in addition , after inspection of the data in @xcite for sources not in my optical sample , i suggest that cam2 - 12 , 14 , and 33 , and probably 34 and 36 , are background giants as well .",
    "this high contamination by background stars ( @xmath40% ) is the source of the low frequency of emission lines among the candidates in @xcite ( 2/29 ) relative to previously known members ( 20/63 ) that was noted in that study . among the remaining 12 objects from @xcite ,",

    "they identified probable cluster members and field stars by the presence and absence of h@xmath5 emission , respectively .",

    "otherwise , h@xmath5 at lower levels is not useful in discriminating between field stars and young stars .",

    "the ir photometric data from that study represent the only constraints on membership .",
    "five of these sources have large excesses at 14.3  and therefore were taken to be members in   [ sec : confirm ] .",

    "when @xcite combined the observed ir photometry of their candidates with a theoretical mass - luminosity relation for an age of 2  myr , they derived masses that were below the hydrogen burning limit for the seven confirmed members .",
    "however , when placed on the h - r diagram (   [ sec : hr ] ) , six of these objects exhibit ages greater than 2  myr and thus higher masses ( @xmath44  @xmath41 ) . one of these sources is anomalously faint for its spectral type , which indicates that it may be observed in scattered light (   [ sec : hr ] ) .",
    "the h - r diagram does imply a substellar mass of @xmath1  @xmath41 for the seventh new member , chsm  17173 , which is the coolest known member of chamaeleon  i at a spectral type of m8 .",
    "for the 144 known members of chamaeleon  i that have spectral type measurements and resolved photometry ( i.e. , excluding t33b ) , i estimate extinctions , effective temperatures , and bolometric luminosities .",
    "i then place these sources on the h - r diagram and use theoretical evolutionary models to examine their masses and ages .",
    "the amount of extinction toward a young star can be estimated from the reddening of either its spectrum or its broad - band colors . to ensure that the color excesses reflect only the effect of extinction , contamination from short and long wavelength excess emission arising from accretion and disks",
    "is minimized by considering a wavelength range of @xmath45 - 1.6  , corresponding to photometric bands between @xmath46 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , given the data that are available for the members of chamaeleon  i , i select the optical spectra from this work and the @xmath34 and @xmath33 colors from 2mass for measuring extinctions . in the following analysis , i estimate color excesses from these two sets of data , compare the excesses to determine the appropriate reddening relations , and compute extinctions for the cluster members from these excesses and relations .    for each member ,",
    "a color excess in @xmath34 , denoted as @xmath47 , is estimated by dereddening the @xmath34 and @xmath33 colors to the locus observed for classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) by @xcite .",
    "the locus is constructed such that the origin coincides with the dwarf colors for the star s spectral type and the slope is that measured by @xcite for m0 stars , which they predicted to remain relatively constant with spectral type .    to measure the reddening - induced color excesses exhibited by the optical spectra , i require estimates of the unreddened spectra as a function of spectral type for young objects in chamaeleon  i. because of the large number of cluster members that were observed , i am able to derive these intrinsic spectra in the following manner .",
    "i select the bluest observed spectrum at each spectral type , to which i then apply the correction for reddening ( typically @xmath48 - 0.5 ) that is necessary to reproduce the change in spectral slopes as a function of spectral type that is exhibited by the standard dwarfs and giants from ",
    "[ sec : class ] . in other words , although the intrinsic spectral slope of a young source may differ from that of a dwarf or a giant at that spectral type , i assume that the variation of the slope with spectral type is the same .",
    "the spectra derived in this way are valid representations of the intrinsic spectra only if at least a few of the members have approximately no extinction ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this assumption is tested in the upcoming comparison of the color excesses measured from the optical and near - ir data . for each cluster member in my spectroscopic sample",
    ", i then deredden its spectrum to match the intrinsic template spectrum at the spectral type in question .",
    "this reddening is quantified by the color excess between 0.6 and 0.9  , denoted as @xmath50 .",
    "i now compare the color excesses @xmath47 and @xmath50 by plotting them against each other in figure  [ fig : av ] .",
    "the fact that the distribution of these data intersects the origin indicates that the intrinsic @xmath34 colors and optical spectra that have been assumed are reasonably accurate , on average . in other words , the members with the bluest spectra from the previous paragraph",
    "indeed have negligible extinction according to their @xmath34 colors . in figure",
    "[ fig : av ] , i next show the relations between @xmath47 and @xmath50 that are produced by the extinction law from @xcite for @xmath51 and 5 .",
    "@xmath52 is the standard ratio observed in the diffuse interstellar medium while @xmath53 is a relatively high value found in some dense clouds .",
    "for instance , several previous studies have reported ratios as high as @xmath53 - 6 for stars toward chamaeleon  i @xcite .",
    "indeed , the data in figure  [ fig : av ] qualitatively confirm the presence of high values of @xmath54 , although there is no reasonable value of this ratio for which the extinction law from @xcite reproduces the observed relation of @xmath55 derived here for chamaeleon  i. because the effective wavelengths of photometric bands shift to longer wavelengths as extinction increases , the constant in this relation is expected to change with extinction .",
    "however , upon simulating this effect with the system transmissions for 2mass @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i find that this slope should change by only a few percent across the range of extinctions considered in figure  [ fig : av ] .",
    "thus , the fitting of a linear relation between @xmath50 and @xmath47 is valid here .",
    "finally , the measurements of @xmath47 and @xmath50 are converted to extinctions .",
    "because @xcite found that the ratio @xmath56 did not change with different values of @xmath54 , this relation should be applicable to chamaeleon  i regardless of anomalies in its extinction law . however , @xmath56 does differ between the extinction laws of @xcite and @xcite , who derive 0.35 and 0.38 for this ratio , respectively . in this work ,",
    "i adopt @xmath57 , which i combine with @xmath55 to arrive at @xmath58 .",
    "for each member of chamaeleon  i , the final estimate of @xmath59 is the average of the values produced by @xmath47 and @xmath50 when both are available , and otherwise is the value from the one measured color excess .",
    "spectral types of m0 and earlier are converted to effective temperatures with the dwarf temperature scale of @xcite . for spectral types later than m0",
    ", i use the temperature scale that was designed by @xcite to be compatible with the models of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities for the members of chamaeleon  i can be interpreted in terms of masses and ages with theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "after considering the available sets of models , @xcite concluded that those of @xcite for @xmath60 and @xcite and @xcite for @xmath61 provided the best agreement with observational constraints . the spectroscopically classified members of chamaeleon  i are plotted with these models on the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "the cluster sequence is bounded by the isochrones for 1 and 10  myr across the entire mass range in the current census .",
    "it is unclear whether a spread of ages is actually reflected in these data as the finite width of the sequence could also reflect extinction uncertainties , unresolved binaries , and variability from accretion and rotation of spotted surfaces @xcite . as long as unresolved binaries are not the dominant component of the width of the cluster sequence , the median of the sequence should reflect the median age of the population , which is a useful characteristic age that can be compared among young populations . in figure",
    "[ fig : hr ] , the models indicate a median age of @xmath3  myr for chamaeleon  i , which is similar to that derived for ic  348 with these models @xcite and slightly greater than the age of @xmath4  myr for taurus @xcite .",
    "chamaeleon  i and ic  348 also exhibit comparable fractions of sources with ir excess emission @xcite , which is consistent with a common evolutionary state .",
    "t14a , chsm  15991 , and iso  225 are anomalously faint for their spectral types , falling below the main sequence in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "field stars that are mistakenly assigned membership in a young cluster can exhibit this characteristic , but youth and membership were firmly established for these stars with the diagnostics in ",
    "[ sec : class ] .",
    "alternatively , if these sources are occulted by circumstellar structures ( e.g. , edge - on disks ) , their observed photometry would measure only scattered light and produce an underestimate of the luminosity . in the case of the late - type object ls - rcra  1 ( m6.5 ) , @xcite suggested an additional explanation for its low luminosity in which intense accretion causes the evolutionary path of a low - mass star or brown dwarf on the h - r diagram to depart from that predicted by models of non - accreting objects .",
    "@xcite favored this scenario more strongly in their discussion of another subluminous late - type object , par - lup3 - 4 ( m5 ) .",
    "they argued that the h@xmath5 , he  i , and ca  ii emission lines in this source and in ls - rcra  1 are produced by accretion and therefore originate near the stellar surface rather than in an extended region , which would in turn imply that the high ratios of lines to continua are intrinsic to the systems rather than resulting from preferential occulting of the central stars versus the line emitting regions .",
    "@xcite did point out that the presence of intrinsically intense lines in par - lup3 - 4 and ls - rcra  1 would not rule out occultations as the cause of the low luminosity estimates , but they deemed this possibility unlikely given the apparent absence of non - occulted counterparts , namely late - type objects with comparably strong emission lines and normal luminosities .",
    "i find the following problems with this line of reasoning .",
    "first , in ls - rcra  1 and par - lup3 - 4 , @xcite and @xcite derived 6.7 and 11 , respectively , for the ratio of h@xmath5 to the sum of the [ s  ii ] lines at 6714 and 6729   .",
    "those authors used the high values of this ratio as evidence that the h@xmath5 emission is produced predominantly by accretion , and suggested that comparable ratios are not observed for stars occulted by edge - on disks .",
    "however , the spectrum of the edge - on system mbm  12a  3c exhibits an even higher ratio of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "thus , even when a star is completely occulted , the observed h@xmath5 emission can arise primarily from the accretion zone .",
    "this result is supported further by data on the young star kh15d , which is eclipsed periodically by circumstellar material @xcite . over the course of an eclipse",
    ", @xcite found that the stellar continuum changed by a factor of @xmath63 while the line flux in h@xmath5 , whose line profile was indicative of accretion , remained constant within a factor of two .",
    "these data demonstrate that a stellar photosphere can be occulted to a much greater degree than the h@xmath5-emitting portion of its accretion columns , which implies that the emission lines may not be intrinsically intense in par - lup3 - 4 and ls - rcra  1 .",
    "indeed , high - resolution spectroscopy of the emission lines in ls - rcra  1 indicates that its accretion is not unusually strong and instead is comparable to that of the other young members of its cluster @xcite .",
    "next , contrary to the statements by @xcite , young late - type objects have been observed with both normal luminosities and @xmath18 comparable to that in ls - rcra  1 and par - lup3 - 4 , examples of which are iso  252 in chamaeleon  i ( this work ) , source 621 in ic  348 @xcite , and s  ori  71 in @xmath64  orionis @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite suggested that primarily low - mass sources would have their evolutionary paths altered by intense accretion , whereas subluminous sources have been found across a wide range of masses in chamaeleon  i , ic  348 , and taurus @xcite .",
    "for instance , like ls - rcra  1 and par - lup3 - 4 , t14a exhibits anomalously faint photometry and intense emission lines that are indicative of accretion ( h@xmath5/[s  ii]@xmath65 , ca  ii triplet @xmath4:1:1 ) , but its spectral type implies a much higher mass ( @xmath66  @xmath2 ) . in summary , while it is possible that the low luminosities of some young low - mass objects are due to intense accretion as proposed by @xcite and @xcite , all available data for sources of this kind are consistent with a known phenomenon  the occultation by circumstellar material . consequently , there is currently no motivation for invoking a second mechanism that may or may not occur in nature .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have attempted to validate stellar properties inferred from h - r diagrams through comparison to the results of @xcite .",
    "however , some of the stars assumed to be members by @xcite have been shown to be field stars in this work .",
    "those authors also estimated spectral types for many of their sources from broad - band photometry alone ( which unfortunately have been adopted as bonafide spectral types by some subsequent authors ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite did not provide a quantitative analysis of completeness during the derivation of the imf and their adopted models are now outdated . for these reasons ,",
    "the masses , ages , imf , and star formation history reported by @xcite have questionable accuracy .",
    "the study by @xcite suffers from similar problems , in contrast to the careful analysis of the imf in chamaeleon  i by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as a part of a new census of the chamaeleon  i star - forming region , i have performed optical spectroscopy on most of the sources that have been previously identified as possible members of the cluster , that lack either accurate spectral types or clear evidence of membership , and that are optically visible ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "after measuring spectral types for the 179 objects in this sample , i used the spectroscopic data and all other available constraints to evaluate the membership status of 288 potential members that have been presented in published surveys .",
    "this analysis has produced a list of 158 confirmed members , 8 of which are later than m6 and thus are likely to be brown dwarfs according to the evolutionary models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the membership of 41 of these sources is established for the first time by data in this paper .",
    "many of the objects that have been referred to as members of chamaeleon  i in previous work lack evidence of membership .",
    "for instance , i find that approximately half of the candidates that were classified as young stars through ir photometry and spectroscopy by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , are field stars , predominantly background giants .",
    "meanwhile , most of the candidates discovered by @xcite are spectroscopically confirmed as members , one of which is the coolest known member of chamaeleon  i at a spectral type of m8 ( @xmath1  @xmath2 ) .    for the known members of chamaeleon  i that have accurate spectral types , i have estimated extinctions , luminosities , and effective temperatures and used these data to construct an h - r diagram for the cluster .",
    "evolutionary models imply a median age of @xmath3  myr for chamaeleon  i , which is similar to that of ic  348 and slightly greater than the age of @xmath4  myr for taurus .",
    "in addition to ages , masses of the members of chamaeleon  i can be estimated from the h - r diagram and evolutionary models . however , the current census of the cluster is not suitable for deriving an imf because the known members were originally identified by signatures of youth ( h@xmath5 , ir excess , variability ) that have different and ill - defined sensitivities as a function of mass .",
    "indeed , i find that it is not possible to define an area of the cluster and an extinction limit within which the current census contains a significant number of members and approaches a high level of completeness for a useful range of masses , which is necessary for constructing a mass function that is unbiased in mass and thus a meaningful representation of the cluster .",

    "<S> i find that many of the objects identified as members of chamaeleon  i in recent surveys are actually field stars . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , 7 of 9 candidates discovered by @xcite are confirmed as members , one of which is the coolest known member of chamaeleon  i at a spectral type of m8 ( @xmath1  @xmath2 ) . </S>",

    "<S> chamaeleon  i has a median age of @xmath3  myr according to evolutionary models , and hence is similar in age to ic  348 and is slightly older than taurus ( @xmath4  myr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of an imf for chamaeleon  i from this census is not possible because of the disparate methods with which the known members were originally selected , and must await an unbiased , magnitude - limited survey of the cluster . </S>"
