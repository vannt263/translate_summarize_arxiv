    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) often show evidence for deep absorption features from 0.71.5  kev which have been typically attributed to ( 739  ev ) and ( 871  ev ) edges .",
    "the ionized gas component creating these features is usually referred to as a ` warm absorber ' and is seen in many seyfert  1 galaxies ( e.g. , reynolds 1997 ; george et  al .",
    "1998b ) and some quasars ( e.g. , halpern 1984 ; brandt et  al .",
    "the fact that these absorption features are seen in @xmath470% of seyfert  1s implies that the ionized gas covers a substantial fraction of the central x - ray source .",
    "the radial location of the warm absorber is still not well constrained .",
    "several seyfert  1s have shown warm absorber edge variability on timescales of hours to weeks ( e.g. , fabian et  al .",
    "1994 ; otani et  al . 1996",
    "; george et al .",
    "1998a , 1998b ) , suggesting that they have some ionized gas lying at distances characteristic of the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "warm absorbers are also a subject of intense theoretical investigation ( e.g. , netzer 1993 , 1996 ; krolik & kriss 1995 ; reynolds & fabian 1995 ; nicastro , fiore , & matt 1999 ) .",
    "they are expected to be emitters of x - ray lines such as  ( 568  ev ) ,  ( 653  ev ) , and  ( 915  ev ) .",
    "they are also expected to produce x - ray absorption lines with significant equivalent widths ( ews ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     or more zones of photoionized material , which are changing in time , to explain this deficit .",
    "this is also reinforced by the good fit of our two component model .",
    "we showed that two absorption components are needed to explain the observed richness of the absorption lines .",
    "as mentioned in ",
    "[ fe_l ] , some lines can provide important density diagnostics , since they arise from an excited fine - structure level with a critical density of order @xmath5 .",
    "we have constructed several high - density models and searched for the strongest fine - structure lines in our data ( at 13.46 and 13.96  ) .",
    "we found that either the lines are blended with other l - shell lines or else the s / n is not adequate to conduct the test .",
    "much better s / n observations , and sole use of the heg to keep the highest possible resolution , are required .",
    "the current observations are inadequate .",
    "many seyfert 1 galaxies containing ionized x - ray absorbers also show strong , narrow , uv absorption lines ( e.g. , crenshaw et al . 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "these features seem to vary in ew and velocity shift on time scales of weeks to months . the suggestion that the lines originate from the same component producing the strong x - ray absorption ( mathur et al .",
    "1994 ) has been tested in many papers ( e.g. , mathur , elvis , & wilkes 1995 ; shields & hamann 1997 ) without conclusive results .",
    "the main unknowns were the sed at far - uv energies ( see figure  [ sed ] ) , responsible for the ionization of the observed uv species , and the poor x - ray spectral resolution .    in paper",
    "i we compared the high - resolution _ chandra _ spectrum of ngc3783 with a uv spectrum taken @xmath6 yr earlier .",
    "we found that the shifts and velocity dispersions of the x - ray absorption lines were consistent with those observed for the uv lines .",
    "however , the calculated warm absorber model of paper i resulted in column densities for and that were 37 and 5 times too small , respectively , when compared with the values deduced from uv observations . we also commented on the fact that the expected column densities for and are very sensitive to the unknown lyman continuum sed .    we have looked again at this issue trying to resolve it in light of newly available uv observations and the improved x - ray models .",
    "first , we compare our _ chandra _ spectrum with _ hst _ stis spectra obtained 37 days later ( crenshaw et al .",
    "the new uv observation shows 3 absorption - line systems blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity by @xmath7 @xmath8560 , @xmath8800 , and @xmath81400  kms@xmath1 .",
    "these systems have velocity dispersions of 160 , 220 , and 210 kms@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "thus , the 2000 uv observation is consistent with the _ chandra _ line shifts , but the uv line widths seem to be narrower than at least the resolved neon x - ray lines . we also note that , in the 2000 uv observation , the @xmath9 kms@xmath1 component became much stronger and is present also in , indicating a lower ionization state compared to the other components .",
    "it is very unlikely that such a system will also show strong x - ray lines .",
    "looking at figure  [ vel_spec ] , we see no highly significant evidence for such absorption system in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we have looked at the uv lines predicted from our lower - ionization shell .",
    "for this component we now find ew()= 0.6   and ew()=3.1  , entirely consistent with the uv observations of crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and superficially confirming the idea that the uv and x - ray lines originate from the same component .",
    "however , as explained briefly in paper  i , this result is extremely sensitive to the ratio of the far - uv to 0.110 kev flux .",
    "the sed assumed in paper  i contained a much larger far - uv flux compared to the one assumed here . as a result ,",
    "the and absorption lines were much weaker than for the current sed .    to verify the above conclusion , we have renormalized the uv - to - x - ray continua in several different ways by changing the parameters of the assumed sed from 40200 ev ( see table  4 and figure  [ sed ] ) . moving only one point , at 0.1 kev , to 0.2 kev ( while keeping the x - ray slope unchanged at @xmath10 ) leads to a reduction by a factor of 3 in ew ( ) and a factor of 2.3 in ew ( ) .",
    "a further move of the point at 40 ev to 60 ev , keeping the uv slope unchanged ( @xmath11 ; see table  4 ) results in further reductions by factors of 4 and 1.4 in ew ( ) and ew ( ) , respectively .",
    "both changes do not influence the chosen value of @xmath12 and have no effect on the calculated x - ray line ews .",
    "thus the ews of the uv absorption lines are extremely sensitive to the exact cut - off frequency of the unobserved uv continuum .",
    "they are also sensitive , by a lesser amount , to the relative uv - to - x - ray normalization .",
    "the conclusion is that there is little one can infer from the comparison of the available uv and x - ray observations regarding the relationship between the uv and x - ray absorbers .",
    "part of the solution is to obtain real simultaneous observations",
    ". these will give the simultaneous ews for the x - ray and uv lines and some handle on the relative uv and x - ray continuum fluxes .      toward the direction of ngc3783",
    "there is a high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) denoted hvc 287.5 + 22.5 + 240 ( lu et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "hvcs are clouds moving at velocities inconsistent with simple models of galactic rotation and are generally defined as having velocities exceeding 90 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the hvc toward ngc3783 has a velocity of 240 kms@xmath1 with respect to the local standard of rest and is at a distance of 1050 kpc .",
    "in addition to absorption it was found to have absorption by and .",
    "we find it unlikely that the absorption we report on in this paper has anything to do with this hvc for several reasons : ( 1 ) the velocity of this hvc is an order of magnitude less than the redshift velocity of ngc3783 , corresponding to @xmath13 resolution elements of the meg at 10  , ( 2 ) the column densities derived for this hvc [ @xmath14 ( ) = @xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath14 ( ) = @xmath17 @xmath16 , and @xmath14 ( ) = @xmath18 @xmath16 ] are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the column densities indicated from the ngc3783 spectrum , and ( 3 ) in the hvc there is no source of radiation to cause the high degree of ionization needed to produce the ions detected in the ngc3783 spectrum .",
    "at least some of the fek@xmath3 fluorescent line emission seen from seyfert 1 galaxies is often very broad and is generally interpreted as originating from an accretion disk orbiting around a central black hole ( e.g. , fabian et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the profile of the line is assumed to reflect gravitational and doppler effects within a few tens of gravitational radii of the black hole .",
    "as narrow fek@xmath3 line emission is also expected from matter beyond the accretion disk , it is important to separate the narrow emission from the broad emission .",
    "the spectral resolution of pre-_chandra _ x - ray missions was not high enough to resolve the narrow component from the broad one ( e.g. , the @xmath20 160 ev fwhm of _ asca _ is too poor for that task ) , and currently only the _ chandra _ hetgs is capable of such separation ( with a factor of @xmath21 better spectral resolution at fek@xmath3 than _ asca _ ) .",
    "0.0 cm 0.5 cm      the narrow fek@xmath3 line from ngc3783 is very prominent in the _ chandra _ hetgs spectrum ( figure  [ fe]a ) .",
    "the line peak is at @xmath22 ev , consistent with fei  xii .",
    "modeling the line in the combined spectrum as a single gaussian , we find a fwhm of @xmath23 m  which is consistent with the line not being resolved at the resolution of the meg .",
    "the line flux is @xmath24 photons @xmath16 s@xmath1 @xmath25 @xmath26 ergs @xmath16 s@xmath1 , corresponding to an ew of 35@xmath2711 m  ( @xmath28 ev ) as measured against the underlying continuum . investigating the heg spectrum alone ,",
    "the fwhm of the line is @xmath29 m .",
    "this fwhm is consistent with the heg resolution of 12 m and thus the line has a fwhm of less than 3250  ^-1 kms@xmath1 .",
    "this velocity is comparable to , or lower than , the velocity of the blr of this object which is @xmath20 4000 kms@xmath1 ( reichert et al .",
    "1994 ; wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ; fwhm@xmath30 ^-1 kms@xmath1 ) . given this upper limit on the narrow fe k@xmath3 width , and assuming a simple correlation of line width with radial location in a keplerian system",
    ", we conclude that the origin of this feature is anywhere from just outside the blr to as far as the nlr . in particular ,",
    "the observed energy and large ew suggest that the line may arise in the putative torus .",
    "ghisellini , haardt , & matt ( 1994 ) and krolik , madau , & zycki ( 1994 ) have calculated the x - ray line emission expected from putative obscuring tori in agns .",
    "both studies predict the fe  k@xmath3 line to have a characteristic ew of @xmath31 ev for a torus which has an opening angle of @xmath32 , an inclination angle to the line of sight of @xmath33 , and a column density @xmath34 @xmath16 .",
    "later , matt , brandt , & fabian ( 1996 ) considered changes in the line ew for various metalicities .",
    "all predicted ews are in agreement with the one measured here and suggest that the narrow fe  k@xmath3 line from ngc3783 could arise from the torus .    in a recent paper ,",
    "yaqoob et al . (",
    "2001 ) report the detection of a narrow fe k@xmath3 line from ngc5548 . in paper",
    "i we indicated the resemblance of the high - resolution x - ray spectrum of ngc3783 to the one of ngc5548 regarding the emission and absorption features at lower energies ( kaastra et al .",
    "also in the narrow fe k@xmath3 line properties we find a good resemblance . in both objects",
    "the peak energy of the line is consistent with the rest energy for neutral iron ( 6.4  kev ) , and the lines widths , ews , and intensities are comparable . in ngc5548 the narrow fe k@xmath3 line is resolved ( @xmath35 ) and is consistent with being produced in the outer blr ; this fwhm is also consistent with the upper limit we derived for ngc3783 .",
    "yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2001 ) do not detect the broad fek@xmath3 line in the _ chandra _ hetgs spectrum of ngc5548 due to the small effective area of the instrument , but they find the statistical upper limits to be consistent with earlier _ asca _ measurements .",
    "the situation is similar for ngc3783 as explained below .",
    "a narrow gaussian emission line does not provide an adequate description of the fek@xmath3 emission observed in a number of previous _ asca _ spectra of ngc3783 .",
    "for instance , george et al . ( 1998a ) found the line to be asymmetric and skewed to lower energies during the 1993 and 1996 observations .",
    "our new _ asca _",
    "data confirm this result . in the lower panels of figure  [ fe]a",
    "we show that while the narrow line derived above is consistent with the 2000 _ asca _ data , the 1996 _ asca _ data show an excess in the red wing of the line . here",
    "we investigate the constraints that can be placed on an accretion - disk line component in the light of our _ chandra _ results .",
    "the broad component is not detected in the _ chandra _ data , and we only derive an upper limit for it",
    ".    following george et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , in this section our model for the fe k@xmath3 emission consists of a narrow gaussian ( energy and width constrained as found above ) plus a `` diskline '' component for a schwarzschild black hole ( see fabian et al .",
    "the latter represents the profile expected from the innermost regions of the accretion flow .",
    "it is parameterized assuming a plane - parallel geometry inclined at an angle , @xmath36 , to the line of sight , and a line emissivity as a function of radius , @xmath37 , proportional to @xmath38 over the range @xmath39 .",
    "there is a degeneracy in such a model since for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the gravitational radius of the black hole ) the relativistic and doppler broadening of the diskline is negligible and hence the profile is approximately gaussian .",
    "thus here we limit @xmath43 , @xmath44 and fix @xmath45 .",
    "fe k@xmath46 emission was included at an intensity 11% of that of the corresponding k@xmath3 component .",
    "we modeled the _",
    "data assuming the underlying continuum derived in  4.1 , using the simultaneous _ rxte _ data to constrain the strength of the reflection component and allowing all parameters in the model to be free .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data give 90% confidence limits on the intensities of the lines of @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the narrow and broad components , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , the _ chandra _ data do not allow us to constrain simultaneously @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath36 , and the rest - frame energy ( @xmath51 ) of the diskline . even when the _ chandra _ and _ asca _ data are combined these parameters are not constrained .",
    "thus we have further restricted our analysis to an `` extreme '' diskline with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54  kev and @xmath55 .",
    "we find such a model to be consistent with the 2000 _ chandra _ and _ asca _ data sets when @xmath56 ( ew @xmath57  ev ) .",
    "the narrow - line component is consistent with those found above [ @xmath58 ; ew @xmath59  ev ] .",
    "the profiles from such a model are compared to the _ chandra _ and _ asca _ data in the upper two panels of figure  [ fe]b .",
    "we have performed a re - analysis of the fek@xmath3 line emission in the earlier _ asca _ data sets . again",
    "all the parameters associated with a general diskline can not be constrained simultaneously by the _",
    "however for an `` extreme '' diskline , as discussed above , we find @xmath60 ( ew @xmath61  ev ) and @xmath62 ( ew @xmath63  ev ) for the combined 1996 data .",
    "this profile is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fe]b .",
    "we note that the ew of the broad component is somewhat lower than the @xmath64  ev reported by george et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "this is primarily due to our inclusion of the compton - reflection component .",
    "we conclude that both the intensity and the profile of the fek@xmath3 line emission changed between 1996 and 2000 . specifically , we find evidence that the ew of the broad component of the line decreased between the observations made at these epochs .",
    "changes in the profile , intensity and/or ew of the broad component have been seen in a number of other agn ( e.g. , fabian et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , the large number of free parameters ( associated with both the fek@xmath3 line emission and the reflected continuum ) and the quality of the data currently available prevent us placing stringent constraints on the cause of such variability in ngc3783 .",
    "the high - resolution x - ray spectrum of ngc3783 shows several dozen absorption lines and a few emission lines from the h - like and he - like ions of o , ne , mg , si , and s as well as from  l - shell transitions .",
    "we reanalyzed the spectrum ( first presented in paper  i ) using better flux and wavelength calibrations .",
    "combining several lines from each element we demonstrated the existence of the absorption lines and determined they are blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity by @xmath0 ^-1 kms@xmath1 .",
    "for the ne lines in the heg spectrum , we find @xmath2  kms@xmath1 ; no other lines are resolved .",
    "we used lfzs to determine the x - ray continuum ( which yielded @xmath65 ) and photoionization modeling ( assuming thermal and photoionization equilibrium ) to model the absorption and emission lines .",
    "we used a model which includes two absorption components that differ by an order of magnitude in their ionization parameters .",
    "the two components are spherically outflowing from the agn and thus contribute , via p  cygni profiles , to both the absorption as well as the emission lines . in our fitted model",
    "the low - ionization component has @xmath66 and a global covering factor of 0.5 .",
    "the high - ionization component has @xmath67 and a global covering factor of 0.3 .",
    "both components have line - of - sight covering factors of unity , hydrogen column densities of @xmath68 , gas densities of 10@xmath69 @xmath70 , and microturbulence velocities of 300  ^-1 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the line ews calculated from the model agree well with the ews measured from the data .",
    "since there are many blended lines in the spectrum , and the quality of the data does not enable deblending , we also compared the model to the data by overploting them .",
    "this comparison further demonstrates the good agreement between the data and our model .",
    "the rich x - ray absorption spectrum of ngc3783 suggests a complex model for this object in particular and for agns with warm absorbers in general .",
    "the model emerging for the x - ray absorption includes two absorbing components , probably related to those seen in uv studies ( e.g. , crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ; m. j. collinge et al .",
    ", in preparation ) where several uv absorption systems are resolved . there may well be several x - ray absorbing systems present , but with the current data quality we can only model two components .",
    "we find the low - ionization component of our model can plausibly produce uv absorption lines with the ews observed .",
    "however , this result is highly sensitive to the unobservable uv - to - x - ray continuum .",
    "although the outflow velocity of the x - ray absorber in ngc3783 is consistent with that of the uv absorber , the low s / n of the high - resolution x - ray spectrum does not allow conclusive comparison .",
    "this must await longer observations simultaneous with the uv .",
    "we find the x - ray data from the _ chandra _ observation to agree well with simultaneous observations from _ asca _ and _ rxte _ both in spectral shape and in the time variability of @xmath71 over a few hours .",
    "the inconsistencies in absolute fluxes between the three observations are consistent with the known uncertainties of the instruments . using the _ asca _ observations we demonstrated that during the _ chandra _ observation ngc3783 was in a typical state .",
    "we are also able to explain the 1 kev deficit found in previous modeling of _ asca _ data ; this feature is probably arising from the many iron l - shell lines not considered previously in the models that are now detected in the high - resolution x - ray spectrum .",
    "we have found a prominent narrow fe  k@xmath3 emission line which is not resolved .",
    "we set an upper limit on its fwhm of 3250  ^-1 kms@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with this line originating outside the blr .",
    "the line flux is consistent with predictions from models of torus emission .",
    "the data can not effectively constrain any broad fe  k@xmath3 emission though they are consistent within the uncertainties with the broad line found previously from this object .    comparing figures",
