    "uncovering the structure of nature is an essential part of our effort to understand the world around us  @xcite .",
    "it is the same when it comes to the complex network  @xcite , which is considered as a simple but powerful representation of real - world complex systems . among the underlying structures of complex networks ,",
    "community structure is considered to be important since it has proven to be strongly related to the dynamics and functions of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "hence , considerable attention has been given from various fields to uncover the community structure of networks  @xcite .",
    "generally , a community is a group of nodes in which the nodes are densely inter - connected compared to the rest of the network . and",
    ", a network is considered to have community structure when there are more links placed within the communities and fewer links placed between the communities .",
    "uncovering the community structure in a given network means finding the best community assignment describing the underlying community structure well . in order to decide",
    "which community assignment is better than any other possible assignments , a benefit function is required .",
    "modularity , which was proposed by newman and girvan  @xcite , is one of the most widely used benefit functions .",
    "although it has been reported that there exist the resolution limit  @xcite and the bias towards balanced partitions  @xcite , modularity is still considered to be an efficient measure of uncovering the community structure .    even after the modularity is chosen as the benefit function , there still lies a difficult problem . finding the community assignment with the highest modularity is not an easy task as the exhaustive optimization of modularity is usually impossible . in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "many methods  @xcite have been proposed to obtain the best approximation of the highest modularity in a reasonable time , and most of those methods are working effectively compared to the computing power they require .",
    "it is important to notice that those methods can only be applied to undirected networks , of which links have no specific direction , because the definition of modularity is limited to undirected ones .",
    "however , many complex networks in the real - world are directed ones , such as the world wide web , citation networks , phone call or email networks , etc .    in many directed networks ,",
    "the direction of a link contains important information such as asymmetric influence or information flow .",
    "a link between a pair of nodes may represent a fundamentally different dynamics when its direction is reversed .",
    "any kind of approach that disregards the direction of links may fail to understand the dynamics and the function of directed networks .",
    "also , any kind of community finding approaches may fail to detect the communities correctly if the direction of the link is not considered properly .",
    "then , there lies the fundamental question of the problem of community identification in directed networks : how should the direction of links be considered ?",
    "this is a question that is not only essential to the community identification but also important to the fundamental understanding of the directed networks .",
    "several recent studies  @xcite have tried to answer this question .",
    "however , it is important to notice that the listed methods do not share a common definition of the community structure in directed networks .",
    "the method of newman and leicht  @xcite , and the method of guimera _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have the similar definition by which nodes are assigned to the same community when the nodes are linked to similar neighbors .",
    "the definition of community used in those works is different from the general definition of community .",
    "a fundamentally different approach is adopted in the work of rosvall and bergstrom  @xcite .",
    "they used an information theory based method that also does not seem related to the modularity optimization method .",
    "leicht and newman  @xcite proposed a method that is different from those previous ones .",
    "they adapted a generalized modularity  @xcite to identify the community structure in directed networks .",
    "since the generalized modularity is consistent with the original modularity in undirected networks , the advantage of this method is apparent : the modularity optimizing algorithms developed in undirected networks are supposed to be applicable to directed networks by this method . however , we find that there may exist some limitations in this method . in sec .  [",
    "sec : genmod ] , it is shown that the generalized modularity may not work as they described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an alternative meaning of the generalized modularity will be discussed .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new generalization of modularity based on linkrank , which is a quantity indicating the importance of links in directed networks .",
    "the definition of community is also changed according to this new modularity .",
    "it will be shown that this definition consists well with the old definition of community and it considers the links of different direction properly .",
    "the application to a model network in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] shows that our method works effectively in detecting communities .",
    "we deal with weighted networks in the derivations , since binary networks can be considered a special kind of weighted networks in which the weight of all links is one .",
    "in undirected networks , a well established method to find communities is the modularity optimizing method , which is finding a good community assignment of networks which maximizes the benefit function named modularity @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the modularity is defined as @xmath1\\delta_{c_i , c_j } } , \\label{eq : modund}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is an element of the weighted adjacency matrix which represents the weight of the link between node @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the strength of node @xmath3 , and the total strength is @xmath6 .",
    "the modularity can be understood as the difference of two quantities .",
    "the first one is the fraction of links within communities , and the second one is the expected value of the first one in a network with the same community divisions and the same strength sequence but randomly connected links .",
    "modularity @xmath0 approaches @xmath7 when a strong community structure is found and approaches @xmath8 when the fraction of links within the communities is no better than a random case .",
    "however , this does not mean the maximized modularity of every random network is around zero .",
    "some random networks may have very high maximized modularity due to fluctuations in the establishment of links  @xcite .",
    "arenas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a generalization of modularity in directed networks by simply replacing the strength terms into directional ones .",

    "the out - strength and in - strength of those nodes are @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the contribution of the link between node @xmath18 and node @xmath13 is equal to the contribution of link between node @xmath14 and node @xmath15 : @xmath19 . ]",
    "leicht and newman  @xcite used this new definition of modularity to find communities in directed networks , both for computer - simulated networks and real - world networks .",
    "they described the meaning of this generalized modularity as follows . for a pair of nodes labeled @xmath18 and @xmath13 ,",
    "when node @xmath18 has high out - degree and low in - degree while @xmath13 has the reverse , then a directed link connecting @xmath18 and @xmath13 is more likely to point from @xmath18 to @xmath13 than the opposite direction .",
    "hence , if a directed link running from @xmath13 to @xmath18 is found in a network , it is a bigger surprise than a link from @xmath18 to @xmath13 .",
    "the link from @xmath13 to @xmath18 should contribute more to the modularity since modularity should be high for statistically surprising configurations .",
    "however , the generalized modularity may not work as described above . because @xmath20 is equal to @xmath21 , the generalized modularity @xmath22 is able to be derived as @xmath23\\delta_{c_i , c_j}},\\ ] ] considering @xmath2 and @xmath24",
    "are summed together and controlled by the same @xmath20 , it is questionable that the generalized modularity can distinguish the direction of links .",
    "[ fig:4nodes ] represents a part of a directed binary network .",
    "node @xmath18 and @xmath14 have a higher out - degree , while node @xmath13 and @xmath15 have a higher in - degree .",
    "according to leicht and newman s explanation , node @xmath18 and @xmath13 should be more likely to be divided into the same community than node @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , the contribution of both pairs to the generalized modularity are actually equal : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the contribution of the link between node @xmath3 and @xmath4 to the generalized modularity @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , it is doubtful that the generalized modularity work as described above",
    ". then , there may arise the following questions : how could the generalized modularity identify communities in directed networks ? and what is the meaning of the generalized modularity ?    as explained in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite , the relation between the generalized modularity @xmath27 in directed networks and the modularity @xmath0 in undirected networks can be expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath0 is the modularity of the undirected network which is generated from the original directed network by ignoring link directions , and @xmath29 is the _ net - strength _ of node @xmath3 .    hence , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : derv ] ) should be the additional information considered in the generalized modularity @xmath27 .",
    "it is easy to notice that the second term would give a positive contribution to @xmath27 only when @xmath30 and @xmath30 are both positive or both negative .",
    "therefore , the effect of the second term is putting together a group of nodes that have positive net - strength , and another group of nodes having negative net - strength . in an extreme case , where there is no community structure when the link directions are ignored , the first term @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : derv ] ) makes no contribution to the modularity and the second term would contribute importantly to the modularity .",
    "it is obvious that the directed network in this case should be divided into two communities by maximizing the generalized modularity @xmath27 ; the one community contains nodes with positive net - strength and the other community contains nodes with negative net - strength .",
    "example networks presented in ref .",
    "@xcite are similar to the extreme case described above , in which no communities can be found if the directions of links are ignored .",
    "those networks were divided into two communities : a community composed of nodes with positive net - strength and another community composed of nodes with negative net - strength .",
    "no effect , such as nodes connected by a link of surprising direction are more likely to be in the same community , has been considered in this approach .",
    "the most important property of the directed network is definitely the direction of links . for example , in a directed network of webpages , a webpage with more incoming hyperlinks is much more important and more likely being visited than a webpage with more outgoing hyperlinks , even if those two pages have the same degree , which is the sum of in - degree and out - degree .",
    "furthermore , a webpage linked by another important webpage should be more important than a webpage linked by a minor webpage .",
    "therefore , a link from an important page should be more important than a link from a minor page , i.e. a link from an important page should be more likely to be an intra - community link .",
    "if one wants to identify the communities in a directed network , it is necessary to take into account this unique property of the directed networks .",
    "actually , there already exists a quantity called pagerank that exploits this unique property in directed networks .",
    "pagerank  @xcite is an analysis algorithm used by google to rank the webpages in the world wide web , which is a typical directed network .",
    "pagerank assigns a quantity that indicates the importance of a webpage with the thesis that a webpage is important if it is pointed to by other important pages .",
    "mathematically , pagerank is the probability of a particular page being visited by a random surfer who clicks the hyperlinks in webpages randomly .",
    "the pagerank equation can be described as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the stationary row vector of @xmath33 called the pagerank vector , and each element @xmath34 is the probability that a random walker is going to visit the node @xmath3 in the stationary state .",
    "@xmath33 is called the google matrix and it is the probability matrix for the random walk process . each element @xmath35 is the probability that a random walker on node @xmath3 moves toward node @xmath4 in the next random walk step .",
    "@xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath2 is the element of the weighted adjacency matrix in directed networks and @xmath37 is the out - strength of node @xmath3 .    in a directed network",
    ", there may exist some dangling nodes , which is a node with only incoming links , and `` trap region '' , which is a region where the random walker can only move in but not move out . in this case , the google matrix defined as above can not guarantee the existence of the stationary row vector @xmath32 , because @xmath33 may not satisfy the requirements of the stochastic matrix in the markov process  @xcite . to avoid this problem ,",
    "the google matrix is actually defined as @xmath38 where ( @xmath39 ) is the teleportation probability , by which the random walker stops following the hyperlinks and opens a random webpage , and @xmath40 is equal to one only if node @xmath3 is a dangling node ; otherwise @xmath40 is zero .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is set to @xmath8 when @xmath42 . by adding @xmath40 and @xmath43 to the definition of @xmath33 , the random walker",
    "would not be trapped in any part of the network during the random walk process .",
    "mathematically speaking , the purpose of this modification is to make the google matrix @xmath33 a completely dense , stochastic , and primitive matrix .",
    "therefore , there always exists a stationary vector @xmath32 for the google matrix @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "following the idea of pagerank , we propose a concept of linkrank , which indicates the importance of the links instead of the importance of nodes in pagerank .",
    "similar to the definition of pagerank , linkrank of a particular link should be equal to the probability that a random walker follows the link from node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 in the stationary state . with the definition of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "linkrank can be simply defined as @xmath44 where @xmath34 is the @xmath3th element of pagerank vector @xmath45 , and @xmath35 is the element of google matrix @xmath33 .    as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : genmod ] , the modularity in undirected networks is qualitatively defined as @xmath46 where the expected value is calculated in a network with the same community divisions and the same strength sequence but randomly connected links . in this paper",

    "a community is no longer a group of nodes in which links are more densely located . instead",
    ", a community is a group of nodes in which a random walker is more likely to stay .",
    "although this definition seems out of nowhere , it will be shown in the following part that this definition is consistent with the old one in the undirected networks and considers the links of different direction properly .    by using linkrank",

    "( [ eq : newmodularity2 ] ) , it is easy to notice that the first term is the fraction of time spent on walking within communities by a random walker since @xmath51 is the probability of the random walker following the link from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , and the second term is the expected value of this fraction .",
    "both terms correspond to the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : newmodularity1 ] ) respectively .    in order to calculate the expected value of @xmath51",
    ", a null model has to be chosen first . in the definition of modularity in undirected networks ,",
    "the standard null model is chosen as a network that has the same strength ( or degree in binary networks ) sequence as the original network ( i.e. the expected strength of each node is conserved and the links are randomly rewired ) . in",
    "directed networks , however , it is not proper to choose the same null model as in undirected networks since strength is not directly related to the random walk process . instead",
    ", pagerank is the intrinsic property of nodes through the random walk process .",
    "it can be shown that the null model of conserving strength sequence does not detect communities as we expected , while the null model of conserving pagerank sequence does  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we choose a random network , in which the pagerank sequence is conserved and the links are randomly rewired , as the null model to compare with .    in this null model",
    ", the expected value of @xmath51 can be calculated as follows . as defined above",
    ", linkrank @xmath51 is the probability that a random walker is moving from node @xmath3 to @xmath4 in the stationary state , and pagerank @xmath34 is the probability that a random walker is visiting node @xmath3 in the stationary state . in order to move from node @xmath3 to @xmath4",
    ", the random walker would have to visit node @xmath3 in the previous step and to visit node @xmath4 in the next step .",
    "the probability of visiting node @xmath3 is @xmath34 , and the probability of visiting node @xmath4 in the next step is @xmath52 because the connection between node @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the original network is not conserved in the null model .",
    "therefore , the probability that a random walker moving from node @xmath3 to @xmath4 in the null model is @xmath53 , which means the expected value of @xmath51 in the null model is @xmath54 finally , the modularity in directed networks is @xmath55\\delta_{c_ic_j}. \\label{eq : newmodexp1}\\ ] ]    interestingly , our new definition of modularity consists well with the old definition of modularity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : oldmodularity ] ) .",

    "this means that the probability that a random walker visiting node @xmath3 in the stationary state is only related to the local structure of node @xmath3 , instead of being related to the global structure . because every link in the undirected network is a bidirectional path , there are no dangling nodes or trap regions in undirected networks .",
    "therefore , the second term of eq .",

    "( [ eq : modund ] ) .",
    "this means that our new definition of community  a community is a group of nodes in which a random walker is more likely to be trapped in  is consistent with the old definition of community  a community is a group of nodes in which links are more densely located .    also , the new modularity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : newmodexp1 ] ) has a similar form with the one - step stability in delvenne _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which is another work revealing the connection between random walk and the modularity .",
    "an remarkable advantage of our method is that all the established optimizing techniques  @xcite developed to maximize the old modularity in undirected networks can be applied to our method directly , except a few algorithms in which some adjustments are needed . for example , to apply the eigenvector - based method  @xcite , a small trick introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is needed to restore the symmetry of the modularity matrix .",
    "it is important to notice that our method can not be applied to all kinds of networks because the direction of a link does not have a universal meaning in all kinds of directed networks .",
    "for example , although a word adjacency network  @xcite and the world wide web are both directed networks , the meaning of direction is fundamentally different in those two networks .",
    "the direction of link in a word adjacency network describes the relative position of the linked words in a sentence , while the direction of link in the world wide web indicates the citation or reference .",
    "information can spread by following the directed links in the latter case .",
    "as pagerank can be applied to any collection of entities linked with citation and reference , our method is supposed to be able to detect communities in directed networks based on citation and reference .",
    "this does not mean that our method is limited to linked documents only .",
    "as social networks such as directed friendship networks , phone call networks and email networks can be considered as a general form of citation / reference networks , our method could be used to detect communities in those networks too .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 controls the priority given to the network structure as opposed to the teleportation effect .",
    "when @xmath43 is close to @xmath7 , the random walk process would be more dependent on the network structure .",
    "therefore , the pagerank , linkrank and the new modularity would be more likely to capture the characteristics of the network if @xmath43 is closer to @xmath7 .",
    "however , it has been reported that pagerank becomes more sensitive to the slight change of network structure when @xmath43 gets closer to @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "considering that it is impossible for a network to describe the underlying system fully and correctly , pagerank can not capture the characteristics of the network when it is too sensitive to the slight change of the structure .",
    "a balance has to be taken between respecting the network structure and reducing sensitivity .",
    "the choice of @xmath43 is an important issue to any other random work research on directed networks .",
    "thus , the research on the effect of @xmath43 requires a general discussion over random walk problems in directed networks .",
    "we would like to tackle this problem in future studies , but it is beyond the scope of this paper . in current status",

    "[ sec : genmod ] , leicht and newman  @xcite proposed that the links with opposite directions should be considered differently to identify communities correctly in directed networks .",
    "the way the direction information is considered in our new modularity is very similar to the way considered in leicht and newman s work .",
    "let s consider the pair of nodes @xmath18 and @xmath13 again .",
    "when node @xmath18 has lower pagerank and node @xmath13 has higher pagerank , the linkrank of the link pointing from @xmath18 to @xmath13 is more likely to be lower than the linkrank of the link from @xmath13 to @xmath18 .",

    "thus , the asymmetry effect of the link direction , which leicht and newman wanted to include in their method , is well considered in our new definition of modularity in a quite systematic way by applying the theory of random walk .",
    "also , the work of rosvall and bergstrom  @xcite is directly related to our work . in their work",
    ", they proposed an information theory - based method to detect communities in directed networks .",
    "this method can be briefly described as follows . for a particular community assignment of a directed network ,",
    "a node name is assigned to each node in the network and a community name is assigned to each community in the network .",
    "the nodes in the same community should have different names to distinguish with , and the nodes from different communities may share the same names because they can be distinguished by their community names .",
    "given the names of nodes and communities , a description can be assigned to a trajectory of a random walk on the network .",
    "the description records the name of each node being visited , and the name of the community which the currently visiting node belonging to is recorded before the node name only when the random walker is coming from a node which belongs to another community .",
    "thus , this description is unique to each trajectory of random walk .",
    "when a random walker is more likely to stay within a group of nodes than average , dividing this group of nodes into the same community will make the description shorter .",

    "the voi is defined as @xmath73 where @xmath18 and @xmath13 are the two community assignments to be compared with , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the total number of communities of assignment @xmath18 and @xmath13 correspondingly , @xmath76 is total number of nodes , @xmath77 is the number of nodes in @xmath3th community of assignment @xmath18 , @xmath78 is the number of nodes in @xmath4th community of assignment @xmath13 , and @xmath79 is the number of nodes which are in @xmath3th community of assignment @xmath18 and in @xmath4th community of assignment @xmath13 at the same time . generally , the voi is large if the compared two community assignments are significantly different , and it is small when the community assignments are similar .",
    "we tested both methods in a model network of @xmath80 nodes , in which @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "since there are no dangling nodes or trap regions in our model network , the teleportation rate @xmath83 is taken as zero .",

    "[ fig : alphavq](a ) , when @xmath70 is small , the community assignments detected by both methods are identical to the embedded structure . however , when @xmath70 is larger than @xmath84 , the voi for the direction - ignoring method starts to get a non - zero value and becomes larger until it fixes at a stationary value .",
    "this means that the community assignment detected by this method is getting more and more different from the embedded community structure and finally fixes at a stationary configuration .",
    "meanwhile , the community assignment detected by our method is identical to the embedded community structure in the illustrated range of @xmath70 .",
    "this significant difference indicates that a method that ignores the direction of links can not identify the community structure effectively in this model network , while our method can detect the communities effectively .",
    "further investigation on the values of modularity and the corresponding community assignments aid the better understanding of this model network and our method .",
    "[ fig : alphavq](b ) shows that the modularity values given by both methods also show different behaviors as the weight @xmath70 becomes larger .",
    "when @xmath70 is small , the community assignment detected by the direction - ignoring method is identical to the embedded community structure .",
    "the modularity for this community assignment can be expressed analytically as @xmath85 and the black dotted line in fig .",

    "this community assignment is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : configurations](b ) .",
    "this result is easy to understand since the weight @xmath70 is large now and the nodes connected by the inter - ring links are more likely to be assigned into the same community .",
    "the modularity for this community assignment is @xmath87 and the black solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphavq](b ) shows the curve of this function . in the range of @xmath88 ,",
    "the modularity values given by simulated annealing are slightly larger than the values given by eq .",

    "[ fig : alphavq](b ) , both the results of simulated annealing algorithm and the analytical functions indicate that , as the weight @xmath70 increases , @xmath0 is decreasing rapidly while @xmath48 is decreasing relatively slowly .",
    "when @xmath70 is larger than @xmath84 , the community assignment which gives the highest @xmath0 is altered from a community assignment which is identical to the embedded community structure to a different community assignment . because the nodes connected by the inter - ring links are more likely to be assigned into the same community in this new community assignment , the new assignment favors larger @xmath70 and @xmath0 starts to increase as @xmath70 becomes larger .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath48 decreases continuously as @xmath70 increases , which is consistent with the fact that the community structure becomes weaker when @xmath70 gets larger .",
    "both the results of voi and modularity show that our method can correctly and robustly detect the community structure of this model network , while the direction - ignoring method can not .",
    "we also performed the same analysis to the model network of various values for @xmath69 and @xmath72 .",
    "all the results are qualitatively the same with the result of @xmath71 .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new definition of the modularity in directed networks by introducing a new quantity linkrank , which indicates the importance of links in directed networks .",
    "the new modularity is related to the random walk process in the network , and the global meaning of our new modularity is the fraction of time spent moving within communities by a random walker minus the expected value of this fraction . and locally , the meaning of the new modularity is that a link with higher linkrank is more likely to be assigned as an intra - community link than a link with lower linkrank .",
    "the definition of community is also changed , according to the change of modularity . in this new definition ,",
    "a community is a group of nodes in which a random walker is more likely to stay .",
    "it has been proven that our new modularity is consistent with the old modularity proposed by newman and girvan  @xcite .",
    "also , other methods of community identification are compared with our method .",
    "it is shown that the method proposed by rosvall and bergstrom  @xcite and our method share the same concept of community structure in directed networks .",
    "a model network is designed to verify our method , and this model network can be used as a benchmark network in further studies of community identification . as most of the modularity optimization methods in undirected methods can be applied to the directed networks by optimizing our new modularity , our method would be very practical to use to identify communities in directed networks .",
