    "the most important questions of celestial mechanics are the ones concerning central configurations .",
    "they have a long history dating back to the 18th century and have been studied by various mathematicians , including euler and lagrange .",
    "the first known central configurations were the three collinear classes discovered in 1767 by euler ( see @xcite ) and the two classes with masses located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle found in 1772 by lagrange ( see @xcite ) .",
    "later it was proved by wintner that the @xmath0 collinear and @xmath1 triangular configurations are the only possible central configurations in the @xmath0-body problem ( see @xcite ) . in general",
    ", the question about the finiteness of number of central configurations has been included in the famous list of eighteen problems of the 21st century by smale ( @xcite ) and it is the following :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` given positive real numbers @xmath2 as the masses in the n - body problem of celestial mechanics , is the number of relative equilibria finite ? ''",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    as a matter of fact , this open question was already formulated by wintner in his book ( @xcite ) in 1941 . in the @xmath3- and @xmath4-body problem",
    "the answer to smale s question ( @xcite ) has been given by hampton and moeckel ( @xcite ) , and by kaloshin and albouy ( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "although as for now the question remains unanswered for @xmath5 and more bodies , there were given some estimations for the number of central configurations .",
    "for instance , merkel in @xcite and pacella in @xcite , using morse theory , determined a lower bound for the number of spatial non - collinear central configurations ( for a lower bound of the number of planar non - collinear central configurations see @xcite ) . for a deeper discussion of central configurations",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "classifying central configurations is a very difficult problem , therefore an answer is sought even with some simplifications , that is imposing restrictions on the masses or considering only highly symmetrical solutions .",
    "one of the many people to go in this direction was palmore , who considered for @xmath6 the configuration of @xmath7 bodies of mass @xmath8 at the vertices of a regular @xmath9-gon and @xmath10-th body of arbitrary mass @xmath11 at its centroid ( @xcite ) .",
    "he showed that for @xmath12 and for @xmath13 there exist unique values of the mass parameter @xmath11 for which this central configuration becomes degenerate .",
    "meyer and schmidt in 1988 reproduced these results and additionally showed that a bifurcation occurs ( @xcite ) . since then a lot more central configurations have been discovered in spirit of these mentioned restrictions .",
    "examples of central configurations which are considered in our paper are the following :    * a planar configuration of two nested squares found in @xmath14 by a. c. fernandes , l. f. mello and m. m. da silva in @xcite , * a planar rosette configuration of @xmath15 bodies studied in @xmath16 by j. lei and m. santoprete in @xcite , and in @xmath17 by m. sekiguchi in @xcite .",
    "there are numerous reasons for studying central configurations .",
    "there exists an important class of solutions of the @xmath10-body problem - the so - called homographic solutions ( @xcite ) - which is directly linked to the concept of central configurations .",
    "a solution is called homographic if at every time the configuration of the bodies remains similar . as a matter of fact",
    ", this can only happen for central configurations .",
    "the euler and lagrange solutions , which we have already mentioned , are the most famous examples .",
    "thus central configurations generate the unique explicit solutions of the @xmath18-body problem known until now .",
    "in particular , planar central configurations also give rise to families of periodic solutions . as a special case",
    ", the homographic solutions for which the configuration just rotates rigidly at constant angular speed are known as relative equilibria . moreover , central configurations are important for instance in analysing total collision orbits , namely a certain change of coordinates in the neighbourhood of a total collision point turns the colliding particles into a central configuration in the limit as @xmath19 approaches the collision time .",
    "this phenomenon was shown initially for the complete collapse of all bodies at the centre of mass by wintner in @xcite and was later generalised by saari in the study of the parabolic escapes of the particles .",
    "the same holds for expanding subsystems , which also asymptotically tend to a central configuration ( readers interested in these two phenomena should see @xcite for details and more references ) .",
    "these examples demonstrate that knowledge of central configurations gives important insight to the dynamics near a total collision and asymptotic behaviour of the universe .",
    "another aspect motivating the search for these special solutions is the fact that the hypersurfaces of constant energy and angular momentum change their topology exactly at the energy level sets which contain central configurations ( @xcite ) .",
    "central configurations are invariant under homotheties and rotations - the first claim comes from the homogeneity of the potential while the second one stems from the fact that the potential depends only on the mutual distances between the particles and not on its positions . additionally , in the planar case the action of the symmetry group , in this case @xmath20 is free , so the quotient space @xmath21 of the action of the group @xmath22 on the configuration space @xmath23 is a manifold . because of this a natural thing to consider is a new potential defined on the quotient space @xmath24 which has been widely used in the literature ( @xcite ) . in this context central configurations",
    "have been viewed not as critical orbits , but as critical points of a `` quotient '' potential .",
    "on the other hand , in the spatial case the action of the symmetry group @xmath25 is not free , therefore the quotient space @xmath26 of the action of the group @xmath25 on the configuration space @xmath23 is not a manifold ( there are two isotropy groups appearing in the configuration space ) , so the use of ordinary theory is not justifiable ( without any differential structure ) .",
    "thus in this case we can not use the approach from the planar one .",
    "for example , the equivariant morse theory has been presented to the study of spatial central configurations in @xcite . in general , a different approach which does not employ the concept of quotient space has also been successfully used ( @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the symmetries , newton s equations are of gradient nature , therefore it seems reasonable to apply methods which benefit from this .",
    "in this paper we use the second approach to study classes of planar central configurations , which are treated as @xmath22-orbits of critical points of @xmath22-invariant potential . among the machinery which is designed to work in the equivariant context making use both of the symmetry and the gradient structure appearing in the problem and which we employ in our paper are equivariant versions of classical topological invariants such as the degree for equivariant gradient maps ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and the equivariant conley index ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this approach using equivariant theory has for instance been used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for general treatment of the degree for equivariant maps we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite . in this article",
    "we apply those topological tools in equivariant bifurcation theory to produce new classes of planar central configurations from known families by obtaining global bifurcations of families of planar central configurations under a change of the degree for equivariant gradient maps .",
    "the same result has been reached for local bifurcations under a change of the equivariant conley index ( @xcite ) . in the planar case because we have exactly one orbit type on the configuration space , the results obtained by using the equivariant conley index or the degree for equivariant gradient maps are equivalent to those which one could get considering the quotient space and applying ordinary conley index or the brouwer degree . however , in the spatial case the approach via the quotient space is not possible . in general , the obtained theoretical results are stronger than these we need to study of the planar @xmath18-body problem .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "on the one hand , we give new results about equivariant bifurcation theory ( see theorems [ twierbif1 ] , [ twchangedegree ] and [ twierbif2 ] ) . on the other hand , we apply those theoretical results to the study of planar central configurations . in the next article we shall present an application of our abstract results to the spatial @xmath18-body problem and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of local and global bifurcations of spatial central configurations . thus the main goal of",
    "this article is to create a homogeneous theory which can be used for both planar and spatial @xmath18-body problems . in the planar case , as we mentioned before , we can consider the orbit space of the action of the group @xmath22 on the configuration space and then use both ordinary morse theory or the brouwer degree and the equivariant approach .",
    "however , in the spatial case we can not work on the quotient space because the action of the group @xmath25 on the configuration space is not free .",
    "notice that we can consider the possibility of working on subsets of the full configuration space which are invariant for the gradient flow and seek bifurcations in these subsets , but it is possible that we can get no bifurcations while there are ones in the full configuration space .",
    "this phenomenon happened for instance in @xcite , that is bifurcations of less symmetrical families from highly symmetrical families of central configurations occur .",
    "meyer and schmidt treated the highly symmetrical family of equilateral triangle with fourth body at the centroid and proved that another families which are less symmetrical ( that is the families of isosceles triangles with fourth body near the centroid and on the line of symmetry of the triangle ) bifurcate from this family .",
    "similarly , these authors taking the family of square with fifth body at the centroid proved bifurcations of families of kites and isosceles trapezoids ( for more examples of this phenomenon see @xcite ) . in our case of the family of rosette configuration of @xmath15 bodies , likewise , we have the existence of bifurcations of central configurations ( not necessarily configurations of rosette type ) from the rosette family ( see theorem [ thmrosette ] ) and it transpires that central configurations which bifurcate are not of rosette type .",
    "however , we do not know the shape of the bifurcating families .",
    "one can compute that there are no values of the mass parameter for which the rosette family is degenerate .",
    "therefore the obtained results are stronger than these which could be get by taking into account the invariant subsets of the configuration space . in the case of the family of two nested squares we also get stronger results not considering invariant subsets .",
    "we stress the fact that the algebraic structure of the potential is not important from the point of view of central configurations , the only things that matter are the rotation and scaling invariance .",
    "this makes the methods that we use applicable to mathematical models of physical problems involving interactions between multiple bodies , whose behaviour is not necessarily governed by newton s gravity laws .",
    "such situation arises for instance in molecular dynamics , where intermolecular relations are modelled using a broad spectrum of potentials .",
    "the famous lennard - jones potential , which approximately describes the behaviour of two neutral atoms or molecules , was studied in this context in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section [ preliminaries ] contains an introduction to the equivariant setting along with the definition and properties of a topological degree suitable in this context and lemmas used in the proofs of our theorems . in section [ bifurcations ] we investigate the @xmath27-orbits of solutions of the equation @xmath28 under the action of @xmath29 strictly speaking we formulate abstract theorems giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of bifurcations in the vicinity of a given family of solutions . in theorem [ wkkoniecznybif ]",
    "we state that only a degenerate critical @xmath27-orbit of solutions of equation @xmath30 can be a @xmath27-orbit of local bifurcation .",
    "the sufficient condition is given by theorem [ twierbif1 ] , its assumptions , which include a change of the degree for @xmath27-equivariant gradient maps computed at critical @xmath27-orbits of @xmath31 , imply the existence of a global bifurcation .",
    "we also provide simple conditions in theorem [ twchangedegree ] and remark [ twbif1remark1 ] , which allow us to verify inequality of degrees .",
    "moreover , we prove a theorem in the spirit of rabinowitz s famous alternative , see theorem [ twierbif2 ] . in section [ applications ]",
    "we apply our abstract results to the planar @xmath18-body problem , namely we consider known families of central configurations - the two squares family and the rosette family - and prove the existence of bifurcations of new classes of central configurations from these families .",
    "we stress that our method is applicable not only in this specific example , but is rather a general framework , which is additionally easily implementable on any computer algebra system , which allows symbolic computations .",
    "notice that in this paper we consider topological bifurcations ( local and global ones , see definitions [ biflok ] and [ bifglob ] ) rather than bifurcations in the sense of a change in the number of solutions .",
    "in other words , in the case of local one , we consider known family of solutions of equation ( so - called trivial solutions ) and seek non - trivial ones nearby . in the case of global one , we seek connected sets of non - trivial solutions nearby the trivial ones which additionally satisfy rabinowitz type alternative ( see condition ) .",
    "those two definitions , the bifurcation in the sense of a change in the number of solutions and the topological bifurcation , are independent , that is the first one can occur while the second one does not occur and inversely . throughout this paper",
    "we will write about topological bifurcations briefly bifurcations .",
    "in this section we review some classical facts on equivariant topology .",
    "the material is fairly standard and well known ( for details see for example @xcite and @xcite ) . throughout this paper",

    "in this section we apply our results to show the existence of new families of central configurations , which bifurcate from certain known families of central configurations .",

    ", we obtain that the families which bifurcate from the family are not of two nested squares type .        now consider a rosette central configuration consisting of @xmath10 particles of mass @xmath636 lying at the vertices of a regular @xmath10-gon , @xmath10 particles of mass @xmath637 lying at the vertices of another @xmath10-gon , where the second one is rotated by @xmath638 and an additional particle of mass @xmath639 lying at the common centre of the two @xmath10-gons ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we analyse bifurcations from this family in the case of @xmath15 bodies ( see figure [ rosette ] ) which are considered in the following positions:[appendixb ]      where by @xmath643 we denote the universal covering of @xmath22 by @xmath32 , that is a mapping @xmath644 given by the formula @xmath645 we transform the coordinates @xmath646 and @xmath647 in the following way : @xmath648 where @xmath649 ( see @xcite ) .",
