    "in recent years lots of effort has been spent on the calculation of scattering amplitudes without the usual feynman diagram approach ; see the reviews @xcite . with an increasing perturbation order or with an increasing number of external particles",
    ", the number of feynman diagrams grows in general rapidly .",
    "however , the final scattering amplitude typically collapses to a rather short expression .",
    "one example is the very short parke - taylor formula @xcite for the tree - level scattering amplitude for an arbitrary number of external gluons .",
    "a tremendous simplification arises from the analytic continuation of the momenta of external particles in the bcfw recursion relation approach @xcite .",
    "in particular all internal lines become on - shell and gauge invariance holds diagram by diagram .",
    "this means that unphysical degrees - of - freedom do not enter the calculation .",
    "the bcfw recursion relations are valid in gauge theories @xcite , but are restricted to tree diagrams ( like the parke - taylor formula ) . there are attempts to generalize the bcfw recursion relation to feynman loop diagrams ; see for instance @xcite .    considering loop diagrams , there is the well - known unitarity cut relation which reduces the loop order of a feynman diagram",
    ". however , the unitarity cut only gives a relation to the imaginary part of a loop diagram .",
    "it has been shown that by a generalization of this idea one - loop amplitudes can be constructed by generalized unitarity cuts @xcite .",
    "the feynman - tree theorem , introduced by richard feynman in 1963 @xcite , opens the loops recursively and is not limited to one - loop feynman diagrams . in each recursion",
    "step a loop is cut in all possible ways from single cuts up to @xmath0 cuts , with @xmath0 the number of propagators in the considered loop . in each recursion",
    "step a loop diagram with @xmath0 propagators is decomposed into @xmath1 diagrams with at least one order of loop reduced .",
    "typically not all of these diagrams contribute . in this sense",
    "the feynman - tree theorem gives a natural decomposition of feynman diagrams into generalized cut diagrams .",
    "recursively , we can open all loops of a feynman diagram , that is , we can deconstruct eventually feynman loop diagrams in terms of tree diagrams .",
    "there is some recent interest in the feynman tree theorem ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "here we shall argue that the feynman - tree theorem combined with the bcfw recursion relation allows for a systematic deconstruction of feynman diagrams into a product of on - shell subamplitudes .",
    "every cut gives a phase space integration over a pair of unobserved particles .",
    "subsequent application of the bcfw recursion relation through analytic continuation of the external momenta allows for a complete factorization of each tree diagram into simple vertex amplitudes . in this way ,",
    "any feynman loop diagram is deconstructable in terms of on - shell subamplitudes . in particular ,",
    "each subamplitude is gauge invariant .",
    "one subtle point is that the feynman - tree - theorem cuts give new external particles with opposite momentum .",
    "singularities are encoded in the corresponding phase space integrations and we have to regularize all diagrams to keep track of the singularities . the key is to regularize the infrared and ultraviolet singularities consistently . we will show that this is possible in dimensional regularization .",
    "the method of first opening the loops with the help of the feynman - tree theorem and then applying bcfw recursion has been discussed in @xcite with an explicit example of a two - point function employing pauli - villars regularization .",
    "eventually we propose an alternative way to compose scattering amplitudes from a product of on - shell , gauge invariant subamplitudes .",
    "depending on the perturbation order considered , an appropriate number of unobserved particles has to be introduced . over the phase space of these unobserved particles",
    "has to be integrated . in this way",
    ", no virtual particles appear and we get the scattering amplitudes in a rather direct way .",
    "the main focus in this work does not lie on the simplification of the actual computation of amplitudes , since we trade loop integrations off against phase - space integrations .",
    "this is in particular true because of the rather large number of subamplitudes .",
    "the point is that the composition of gauge - invariant subamplitudes with on - shell particles represents physical scattering amplitudes , since unphysical off - shell degrees as well as gauge degrees are systematically avoided .",
    "since we dimensionally regularize infrared and ultraviolet singularities , the weyl spinor formalism can not be applied directly as long as the weyl spinors are given in two dimensions , corresponding to four - dimensional dirac spinors .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the method shown here to the weyl spinor formalism .",
    "the integrations over the phase space could be performed in terms of weyl spinors .",
    "some work has been done in context of weyl spinors with generalized cuts ; see for instance @xcite .    in the following section [ deconstruct ] we present the details of the argument to deconstruct feynman diagrams in terms of on - shell gauge - invariant amplitudes . in section [ vertex ]",
    "we illustrate the method in an explicit example , the electron - photon vertex correction .",
    "in order to make this paper more self contained we briefly remind the reader about the feynman - tree theorem @xcite . a feynman diagram with @xmath2 loops",
    "is reduced to diagrams with at most @xmath3 loops in each recursion step , that is , any loop feynman diagram is eventually given in terms of tree diagrams .",
    "this reduction follows from the introduction of _ advanced propagators _ @xmath4 in addition to the usual propagators @xmath5 : @xmath6 with help of the identity @xmath7 with @xmath8 the principal value prescription we have @xmath9 with @xmath10 , as usual . in an arbitrary loop diagram we subsequently consider each loop and replace the usual feynman propagators @xmath5 by the advanced propagators @xmath4 . in the loop integration , owing to the advanced propagators , the poles of the zero component are now above the real axis .",
    "we therefore see that the loop integral vanishes when we close the integration contour on the lower half plane . with we get @xmath11 the numerator of the loop diagram @xmath12 depends in general also on the loop momentum , as indicated .",
    "we recognize the recursion relation in the last expression of : the original feynman loop diagram is given in terms of diagrams with propagators replaced by the delta distribution terms . in the product expansion",
    "we find that at least one propagator is cut reducing the number of loops about at least one unit .",
    "recursive application opens all loops in terms of tree diagrams .",
    "let us note that a loop diagram with @xmath0 propagators results in each recursion step to @xmath1 loop - reduced diagrams .",
    "we observe that by the bcfw recursion relations @xcite we can express the tree amplitudes , resulting from the feynman - tree theorem , in terms of on - shell amplitudes .",
    "the basic idea of the bcfw recursion relations is analytic continuation of the external momenta . in this way tree",
    "amplitudes factorize into on - shell subamplitudes without violation of momentum conservation . in an arbitrary tree amplitude",
    "let us denote the @xmath13 external momenta by @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "these external momenta are shifted , @xmath16 with one common @xmath17 and appropriately chosen vectors @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 , keeping in particular @xmath23 invariant . by the analytic continuation a tree amplitude @xmath24 can be decomposed in terms of on - shell subamplitudes , @xmath25 here , @xmath26 denotes the shifted amplitude with the position of the poles in the complex plane at @xmath27 . on the right - hand side",
    "we have the on - shell subamplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with a propagator factor @xmath30 .",
    "the term @xmath31 denotes the residues of the poles of @xmath26 at @xmath32 . in case of a vanishing term @xmath31",
    "we have on the right - hand side the desired factorization into on - shell subamplitudes .",
    "it has been shown that the term @xmath31 vanishes for an appropriate shift of the external momenta in gauge theories @xcite .",
    "an example of a theory , where we do not have a vanishing contribution @xmath31 is @xmath33 theory , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "considering gauge theories we have therefore the appropriate method we can apply to the diagrams originating from the cut diagrams , which themselves come from the feynman - tree theorem .",
    "note that all internal particles become on - shell , on the one hand from the cuts of the feynman - tree theorem and on the other hand from the bcfw recursion relations .",
    "every cut corresponds to a pair of unobserved particles .",
    "these pairs have opposite momenta and correspond to an unobserved particle - antiparticle state .",
    "we have to sum over all possible spins ( and other degrees - of - freedom ) of the unobserved particles .",
    "we observe that we equivalently can start the construction of scattering amplitudes by gauge invariant on - shell diagrams : to a given perturbation order we have to consider an appropriate number of unobserved particles .",
    "in particular all particles are on - shell and each contribution is gauge invariant .",

    "since the diagram is singular we employ dimensional regularization which gives the usual @xmath44-dimensional integral measure together with an arbitrary mass scale @xmath45 .",
    "using passarino - veltman tensor reduction @xcite and standard scalar integrals we find the well - known result @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 the standard scalar integrals ( see for instance @xcite for explicit expressions for the scalar integrals ) .",
    "in particular the ultraviolet and infrared singularities of this vertex correction are encoded in these scalar integrals .",

    "this example shows that we can compute the scattering amplitude starting with the amplitudes as presented in fig .",
    "[ ampbcfw ] .",
    "since we are focussing on the vertex correction to order @xmath50 these are all contributions we have to consider to this order .",
    "obviously , in this way we get the scattering amplitud by on - shell , gauge - invariant subamplitudes and the elementary building block is the fermion - photon vertex .",
    "the bcfw recursion relations are a very elegant way to compute _ tree _ scattering amplitudes in terms of gauge invariant on - shell subamplitudes .",
    "we have shown that loop amplitudes can be decomposed by the bcfw recursion relations if the loops are recursively opened by the application of the feynman - tree theorem .",
    "since the cut diagrams of the feynman - tree theorem are singular in general , we have to consistently regularize these singularities . here",
    "we used dimensional regularization and used the fact that the bcfw recursion relations are valid in @xmath44 dimensions .",
    "we note that the method is not limited to a certain perturbation order .    in an explicit example , namely , the electron - photon vertex correction , we have shown the method in practice .",
    "we have seen that for every cut , coming from the feynman - tree theorem , we encounter an unobserved particle pair . eventually , in the deconstruction of loop diagrams , all particles become on - shell , on the one hand from the cuts and on the other hand from the bcfw factorization . moreover , every contribution to the scattering amplitude is separately gauge invariant .",

    "systematically , unphysical degrees - of - freedom , that is , off - shell modes and gauge degrees - of - freedom are avoided .",
    "in contrast , in the usual feynman diagram approach , gauge invariance is in general violated in each feynman diagram and only restored in the sum of diagrams .",
