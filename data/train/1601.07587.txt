    "one of the fundamental properties of fractal objects is self - similarity , which means that pieces of an object are similar to the whole object . in the last twenty years",
    "the notion of self - similarity has successfully penetrated into algebra .",
    "this lead to the development of many interesting constructions such as self - similar groups and semigroups , iterated monodromy groups , self - iterating lie algebras , permutational bimodules , etc .",
    "the first examples of self - similar groups showed that these groups enjoy many fascinating properties ( torsion , intermediate growth , finite width , just - infiniteness and many others ) and provide counterexamples to several open problems in group theory .",
    "later , nekrashevych showed that self - similar groups appear naturally in dynamical systems as iterated monodromy groups of self - coverings and provide combinatorial models for iterations of self - coverings .",
    "self - similar groups are defined by their action on the space @xmath4 of all finite words over a finite alphabet @xmath1  one the most basic self - similar object .",
    "a faithful action of a group @xmath5 on @xmath4 is called self - similar if for every @xmath6 and @xmath7 there exist @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for all words @xmath11 .",
    "the self - similarity of the action is reflected in the property that the action of any group element on a piece @xmath12 ( all words with the first letter @xmath13 ) of the space @xmath4 can be identified with the action of another group element on the whole space @xmath4 .",
    "we can also imagine the set @xmath4 as the vertex set of a regular rooted tree with edges @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath11 .",
    "then every self - similar group acts by automorphisms on this tree .",
    "alternatively , self - similar groups can be defined as groups generated by the states of invertible mealy automata which are also known as automaton groups or groups generated by automata .",
    "all these interpretations come from different applications of self - similar groups in diverse areas of mathematics : geometric group theory , holomorphic dynamics , fractal geometry , automata theory , etc .",
    "( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we consider schreier graphs of self - similar actions of groups . given a group @xmath5 generated by a finite set @xmath16 and acting on a set @xmath17 , one can associate to it the ( simplicial ) schreier graph @xmath18 : the vertex set of the graph is the set @xmath17 , and two vertices @xmath13 and @xmath19 are adjacent if and only if there exists @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "schreier graphs are generalizations of the cayley graph of a group , which corresponds to the action of a group on itself by the multiplication from the left .",
    "every self - similar group @xmath5 preserves the length of words in its action on the space @xmath4 .",
    "we then have a family of natural actions of @xmath5 on the sets @xmath22 of words of length @xmath23 over @xmath1 . from these actions",
    "one gets a family of corresponding finite schreier graphs @xmath24 .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that for a few self - similar groups the graphs @xmath25 are substitution graphs ( see @xcite )  they can be constructed by a finite collection of vertex replacement rules  and , normalized to have diameter one , they converge in the gromov - hausdorff metric to certain fractal spaces .",
    "however , in general , the schreier graphs of self - similar groups are neither substitutional nor self - similar in any studied way ( see discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  i.4 ) ) . nevertheless , the observation from @xcite lead to the notion of the limit space of a self - similar group introduced by nekrashevych @xcite , which usually have fractal structure .",
    "although finite schreier graphs @xmath25 of a group do not necessary converge to the limit space , they form a sequence of combinatorial approximations to it .",
    "any self - similar action can be extended to the set @xmath0 of right - infinite words over @xmath1 ( boundary of the tree @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore we can also consider the uncountable family of schreier graphs @xmath26 corresponding to the action of the group on the orbit of @xmath27 .",
    "each schreier graph @xmath28 can be obtained as a limit of the sequence @xmath24 in the space @xmath29 of ( isomorphism classes of ) pointed graphs with pointed gromov - hausdorff topology .",
    "the map @xmath30 sending a point @xmath27 to the isomorphism class of the pointed graph @xmath31 pushes forward the uniform probability measure on the space @xmath32 to a probability measure on the space of schreier graphs .",
    "this measure is the so - called benjamini - schramm limit of the sequence of finite graphs @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the family of schreier graphs @xmath2 and the limit space represent two limiting constructions associated to the action and to the sequence of finite schreier graphs @xmath24 .",
    "structure of these schreier graphs as well as some of their properties such as spectra , expansion , growth , random weak limits , probabilistic models on them , have been studied in various works over the last ten years , see @xcite .",
    "most of the studied self - similar groups are generated by the so - called bounded automata introduced by sidki in @xcite .",
    "the structure of bounded automata is clearly understood , which allows one to deal fairly easily with groups generated by such automata .",
    "the main property of bounded automaton groups is that their action is concentrated along a finite number of `` directions '' in the tree @xmath4 .",
    "every group generated by a bounded automaton belongs to an important class of contracting self - similar groups , which appear naturally in the study of expanding ( partial ) self - coverings of topological spaces and orbispaces , as their iterated monodromy groups @xcite .",
    "moreover , all iterated monodromy groups of post - criticaly finite polynomials are generated by bounded automata .",
    "the limit space of an iterated monodromy group of an expanding ( partial ) self - covering @xmath33 is homeomorphic to the julia set of the map @xmath33 . in the language of limit spaces ,",
    "groups generated by bounded automata are precisely those finitely generated self - similar groups whose limit spaces are post - critically finite self - similar sets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such sets play an important role in the development of analysis on fractals ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the ends of the schreier graphs @xmath34 of self - similar groups generated by bounded automata and the corresponding limit spaces .",
    "the number of ends is an important asymptotic invariant of an infinite graph .",
    "roughly speaking , each end represents a topologically distinct way to move to infinity inside the graph .",
    "the most convenient way to define an end in an infinite graph @xmath35 is by the equivalence relation on infinite rays in @xmath35 , where two rays are declared equivalent if their tails lie in the same connected component of @xmath36 for any finite subgraph @xmath37 of @xmath35 .",
    "any equivalence class is an _",
    "end _ of the graph @xmath35 .",
    "the number of ends is a quasi - isometric invariant .",
    "the cayley graph of an infinite finitely generated group can have one , two or infinitely many ends .",
    "two - ended groups are virtually infinite cyclic and the celebrated theorem of stallings characterizes finitely generated groups with infinite number of ends .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* given a group generated by a bounded automaton we exhibit a constructive method that determines , for a given right - infinite word @xmath27 , the number of ends of the schreier graph @xmath28 ( section  [ section_ends ] ) . *",
    "we show that the schreier graphs @xmath28 of a group generated by a bounded automaton have either one or two ends almost surely , and there are only finitely many schreier graphs with more than two ends ( section  [ section_number_ends ] , proposition  [ prop_more_ends ] , theorem  [ th_classification_two_ends ] ) . *",
    "we classify bounded automata generating groups whose schreier graphs @xmath28 have almost surely two ends ( theorem  [ th_classification_two_ends ] ) . in the binary case ,",
    "these groups agree with the class of groups defined by uni in @xcite ( theorem  [ th_sch_2ended_binary ] ) . * we exhibit a constructive method that describes cut - points of limit spaces of groups generated by bounded automata ( section  [ section_component ] ) .",
    "* in particular , we get a constructive method that describes cut - points of julia sets of post - critically finite polynomials ( section  [ section_component ] ) . *",
    "we show that a punctured limit space has one or two connected components almost surely ( theorem  [ thm_punctured_tile_ends ] ) .",
    "* we classify contracting self - similar groups whose limit space is homeomorphic to an interval or a circle ( corollary  [ cor_limsp_interval_circle ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we determine the number of connected components in the schreier graph @xmath38 with removed vertex @xmath39 .",
    "the answer comes from a finite deterministic acceptor automaton over the alphabet @xmath1 ( section  [ finite automaton section ] ) so that given a word @xmath40 the automaton returns the number of components in @xmath38 ( theorem  [ thm_number_of_con_comp ] ) . using this automaton we determine the number of finite and infinite connected components in @xmath41 for any @xmath3 . by establishing the connection between the number of ends of the schreier graph @xmath2 and the number of infinite components in @xmath41 ( proposition  [ prop_ends_limit ] )",
    ", we determine the number of ends of @xmath2 ( theorem  [ thm_number_of_ends ] ) .",
    "if a self - similar group acts transitively on @xmath22 for all @xmath42 , the action on @xmath0 is ergodic with respect to the uniform measure on @xmath0 , and therefore the schreier graphs @xmath2 for @xmath3 have the same number of ends almost surely . for a group generated by a bounded automaton",
    "the `` typical '' number of ends is one or two , and we show that in most cases it is one , by characterizing completely the bounded automata generating groups whose schreier graphs @xmath2 have almost surely two ends ( theorem  [ th_classification_two_ends ] ) . in the binary case we show that automata giving rise to groups whose schreier graphs have almost surely two ends correspond to the adding machine or to one of the automata defined by uni in @xcite ( theorem  [ th_sch_2ended_binary ] ) .    in section  [ section_cut - points ]",
    "we recall the notion of the limit space of a contracting self - similar group , and study the number of connected components in a punctured limit space for groups generated by bounded automata .",
    "we show that the number of ends in a typical schreier graph @xmath2 coincides with the number of connected components in a typical punctured neighborhood ( punctured tile ) of the limit space ( theorem  [ thm_punctured_tile_ends ] ) . in particular , this number is equal to one or two .",
    "this fact is well - known for connected julia sets of polynomials . while zdunik @xcite and smirnov @xcite proved that almost every point of a connected polynomial julia set is a bisection point only when the polynomial is conjugate to a chebyshev polynomial , we describe bounded automata whose limit spaces have this property .",
    "moreover , we provide a constructive method to compute the number of connected components in a punctured limit space ( section  [ cut - points section ] ) . finally , using the results about ends of schreier graphs , we classify contracting self - similar groups whose limit space is homeomorphic to an interval or a circle ( corollary  [ cor_limsp_interval_circle ] )",
    ". this result agrees with the description of automaton groups whose limit dynamical system is conjugate to the tent map given by nekrashevych and uni in @xcite .",
    "in section  [ section_preliminaries ] we recall all needed definitions concerning self - similar groups , automata and their schreier graphs . in section 5",
    "we illustrate our results by performing explicit computations for three concrete examples : the basilica group , the gupta - fabrykowski group , and the iterated monodromy group of @xmath43 .",
