    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the hydrodynamic limit for interacting particle systems in the crystal lattice .",
    "problems of the hydrodynamic limit have been studied intensively in the case where the underlying space is the euclidean lattice .",
    "we extend problems to the case where the underlying space has geometric structures : the _ crystal lattice_. the crystal lattice is a generalization of classical lattice , the square lattice , the triangular lattice , the hexagonal lattice , the kagom lattice ( figure[crystals ] ) and the diamond lattice . before explaining difficulties for this extension and entering into details",
    ", we motivate to study these problems .",
    "there are many problems on the scaling limit of interacting particle systems , which have their origins in the statistical mechanics and the hydrodynamics .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein . )",
    "the hydrodynamic limit for the exclusion process is one of the most studied models in this context .",
    "here we give only one example for exclusion processes in the integer lattice , which is a prototype of our results , due to kipnis , olla and varadhan ( @xcite ) .",
    "from the view point of physics and mathematics , it is natural to ask for the scaling limit of interacting particle systems evolving in more general spaces and to discuss the relationship between macroscopic behaviors of particles and geometric structures of the underlying spaces . in this paper",
    ", we deal with the crystal lattice , which is the simplest extension of the euclidean lattice @xmath0 .",
    "although the crystal lattice has periodic global structures , it has inhomogeneous local structures .",
    "on the other hand , crystal lattices have been studied in view of discrete geometric analysis by kotani and sunada ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the expository article @xcite ) .",
    "they formulate a crystal lattice as an abelian covering graph , and then they study random walks on crystal lattices and discuss the relationship between asymptotic behaviors of random walks and geometric structures of crystal lattices . in @xcite , they introduce the _ standard realization _ , which is a discrete harmonic map from a crystal lattice into a euclidean space to characterize an equilibrium configuration of crystals . in @xcite",
    ", they discuss the relationship between the _ albanese metric _ which is introduced into the euclidean space , associated with the standard realization and the central limit theorem for random walks on the crystal lattice .",
    "considering exclusion processes on the crystal lattice , one is interested to ask what geometric structures appear in the case where the interactions depend on the local structures .    given a graph , the exclusion process on it describes the following dynamics : particles attempt to jump to nearest neighbor sites , however , they are forbidden to jump to sites which other particles have already occupied .",
    "so , particles are able to jump to nearest neighbor vacant sites .",
    "then , the problem of the hydrodynamic limit is to capture the collective behavior of particles via the scaling limit .",
    "if we take a suitable scaling limit of space and time , then we observe that the density of particles is governed by a partial differential equation as a macroscopic model .",
    "here it is necessary to construct a suitable scaling limit for a graph and to know some analytic properties of the limit space .",
    "a crystal lattice is defined as an infinite graph @xmath1 which admits a free action of a free abelian group @xmath2 with a finite quotient graph @xmath3 .",
    "we construct a scaling limit of a crystal lattice as follows : let @xmath4 be a positive integer . take a finite index subgroup @xmath5 of @xmath2 , which is isomorphic to @xmath6 when @xmath2 is isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "then we take the quotient of @xmath1 by @xmath5-action : @xmath7 .",
    "we call this finite quotient graph @xmath7 the _ @xmath4-scaling finite graph_. the quotient group @xmath8 acts freely on @xmath7 . here",
    "we consider exclusion processes on @xmath7 . to observe these processes in the continuous space",
    ", we embed @xmath7 into a torus .",
    "we construct an embedding map @xmath9 from @xmath7 into a torus by using a harmonic map @xmath10 in the discrete sense in order that the image @xmath11 converges to a torus as @xmath4 goes to the infinity .",
    "( here the convergence of metric spaces is verified by using the gromov - hausdorff topology , however , we do not need this notion in this paper . )",
    "then we obtain exclusion processes embedded by @xmath9 into the torus .    in this paper",
    ", we deal with the simplest case among exclusion processes : _ the symmetric simple exclusion process _ and its perturbation : _ the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process_. in the latter case , we obtain a heat equation with nonlinear drift terms on torus as the limit of process of empirical density ( theorem[main ] and examples below ) .",
    "we observe that the diffusion coefficient matrices and nonlinear drift terms can be computed by data of a finite quotient graph @xmath3 and a harmonic map @xmath10 .",
    "( see also examples in section [ harmonic ] . )",
    "the hydrodynamic limit for these processes on the crystal lattice is obtained as an extension of the one on @xmath0 .",
    "so , first , we review the outline of the proof for @xmath0 , following the method by guo , papanicolaou and varadhan in @xcite . since the lattice @xmath0 is naturally embedded into @xmath12 , the combinatorial laplacian on the scaled discrete torus converges to the laplacian on the torus according to this natural embedding .",
    "the local ergodic theorem is the key step of the proof since it enables us to replace local averages by global averages and to verify the derivation of the limit partial differential equation .",
    "it is formulated by using local functions on the configuration space and the shift action on the discrete torus .",
    "the proof of the local ergodic theorem is based on the one - block estimate and the two - blocks estimate .",
    "roughly speaking , the one - block estimate is interpreted as the local law of large numbers and the two - blocks estimate is interpreted as the asymptotic independence of two different local laws of large numbers .",
    "second , we look over the outline of the proof for the crystal lattice .",
    "there are two main points with regard to the difference between @xmath0 and the crystal lattice , that are the convergence of the laplacian and the local ergodic theorem .",
    "although the crystal lattice @xmath1 is embedded into an euclidean space by a harmonic map @xmath10 , the combinatorial laplacian on the image of the @xmath4-scaling finite graph @xmath11 does not converge to the laplacian on the torus straightforwardly .",
    "it is proved by averaging each fundamental domain by @xmath2-action because of the local inhomogeneity of the crystal lattice .",
    "thus , it is necessary to obtain the local ergodic theorem compatible with the convergence of the laplacian .",
    "furthermore , it is also necessary to obtain the local ergodic theorem compatible with the local inhomogeneity of the crystal lattice . for these reasons",
    ", we have to modify the local ergodic theorem in the case of crystal lattices . to formulate the local ergodic theorem in the crystal lattice ,",
    "we introduce the notion of _ @xmath2-periodic local function bundles_. a @xmath2-periodic local function bundle is a family of local functions on the configuration space which is parametrized by vertices periodically .",
    "moreover , we introduce two different ways to take local averages of a @xmath2-periodic local function bundle . the first one is to take averages per each fundamental domain as a unit .",
    "the second one is to take averages on each @xmath2-orbit .",
    "the local ergodic theorem in the crystal lattice is formulated by using @xmath2-periodic local function bundles , two types of local averages and the @xmath13-action on the @xmath4-scaling finite graph @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , we use only special @xmath2-periodic local function bundles to handle the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process .",
    "the proof of this local ergodic theorem is also based on the one - block estimate and the two - blocks estimate .",
    "proofs of these two estimates are analogous to the case of the discrete torus since we use the fact that the whole crystal lattice is covered by the @xmath2-action of a fundamental domain in the first type of the local average and we restrict to a @xmath2-orbit in the second type of the local average . in this paper , we call the local ergodic theorem the _ replacement theorem _ and prove it in the form of the super exponential estimate . the derivation of the hydrodynamic equation is the same manner as the case of the discrete torus .    let us mention related works .",
    "interacting particle systems are categorized into the gradient system and the non - gradient system , according to types of interactions .",
    "we call the system the gradient system when the interaction term is represented by the difference of local functions .",
    "otherwise , we call the system the non - gradient system .",
    "we mention a recent work on the non - gradient system by sasada @xcite .",
    "the symmetric simple exclusion process is a model of the gradient system .",
    "our problems essentially correspond to problems for the gradient system since the hydrodynamic limit for the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process is reduced to the one for the symmetric simple exclusion process , following @xcite . as for the hydrodynamic limit on spaces other than the euclidean lattice ,",
    "jara investigates the hydrodynamic limit for zero - range processes in the sierpinski gasket ( @xcite ) .",
    "as for the crystal lattice , there is another type of the scaling limit . in @xcite , shubin and sunada study lattice vibrations of crystal lattices and calculate one of the thermodynamic quantities : the specific heat .",
    "they derive the equation of motion by taking the continuum limit of the crystal lattice . as a further problem , we mention the following problem : recently , attentions have been payed for interacting particle systems evolving in random environments ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . for example , the quenched invariance principle for the random walk on the infinite cluster of supercritical percolation of @xmath0 with @xmath14 is proved by berger and biskup ( @xcite ) .",
    "their argument is based on a harmonic embedding of percolation cluster into @xmath12 . our use of the harmonic map @xmath10 and local function bundles will play a role in the systematic treatment of particle systems in more general random graphs .",
    "furthermore , the hydrodynamic limit on the inhomogeneous crystal lattice is considered as the case where the crystal lattice has topological defects .",
    "this problem would be interesting in connection with material sciences .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ crystal lattices ] , we introduce the crystal lattice and construct the scaling limit by using discrete harmonic maps . in section [ hydrodynamic limit ] , we formulate the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process on the crystal lattice and state the main theorem ( theorem [ main ] ) . in section",

    "<S> we investigate the hydrodynamic limit for weakly asymmetric simple exclusion processes in crystal lattices . we construct a suitable scaling limit by using a discrete harmonic map . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall observe , the quasi - linear parabolic equation in the limit is defined on a flat torus and depends on both the local structure of the crystal lattice and the discrete harmonic map . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the local ergodic theorem on the crystal lattice by introducing the notion of local function bundle , which is a family of local functions on the configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> the ideas and methods are taken from the discrete geometric analysis to these problems . </S>",
    "<S> results we obtain are extensions of ones by kipnis , olla and varadhan to crystal lattices . </S>"
