    "the newtonian @xmath0-body problem with vanishing total energy , @xmath1 , momentum , @xmath2 , and angular momentum , @xmath3 , is a useful model of the universe in many respects @xcite . as we show below",
    ", these conditions match the intution that only relational degrees of freedom of the universe should have physical significance @xcite . a total angular momentum @xmath4 and a total energy @xmath5 would define , respectively , an external frame in which the universe is rotating and an absolute unit of time .",
    "moreover the conditions @xmath6 ensure scale - invariance and are close analogues of the arnowitt ",
    " misner constraints of hamiltonian general relativity ( in the spatially closed case ) @xcite . these properties , along with the attractivity of gravity , are architectonic and likely to be shared by any fundamental law of the universe .",
    "first support for our claim follows from the rigorous results of @xcite that asymptotically ( as the newtonian time @xmath7 ) @xmath0-body solutions with @xmath8 typically ` evaporate ' into subsystems ( sets of particles with separations bounded by @xmath9 ) whose centers of mass separate linearly with @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "is , of course , a manifestation of newton s 1st law in the asymptotic regime .",
    "our result arises from the combination of this behavior with gravity s role in creating subsystems that mostly then become stably bound . ]",
    "each subsystem consists of individual particles and/or clusters whose constituents remain close to each other , i.e. , the distances between constituent particles of a cluster are bounded by a constant for all times .",
    "one finds in numerical simulations that the bulk of the clusters are 2-body ` kepler pairs ' whose motion asymptotes into elliptical keplerian motion . for reasons we next discuss ,",
    "this @xmath11 behavior occurs in all typical solutions either side of a uniquely defined point of minimum expansion , as illustrated in figure  [ triplepicture ] .",
    "we identify and explain the arrows of time in the @xmath0-body solutions through the way the _ shape _ degrees of freedom ( defined below ) evolve and now explain why .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the position of particle @xmath13 , @xmath14 its momentum and @xmath15 its mass .",
    "we consider the newtonian @xmath0-body problem with vanishing total energy @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the dynamics generated by a potential @xmath19 homogeneous is homogeneous of degree @xmath20 if @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "] of degree @xmath20 satisfies _ dynamical similarity _",
    "@xcite : the anisotropic rescaling @xmath23 of spatial distances and newtonian time sends solutions into solutions .",
    "kepler s third law is a consequence of this property in the particular case @xmath24 .",
    "dynamical similarity enables us to eliminate scale from the @xmath0-body problem . as overall scale of the system",
    "it is natural to use @xmath25 , the centre - of - mass moment of inertia , @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the centre - of - mass coordinates and @xmath28 .",
    "we can express @xmath25 in terms of all the remaining variables in the system by solving the constraint @xmath16 for it @xcite .",
    "this can be done uniquely as we now prove .",
    "a well - known analytic result in @xmath0-body theory is the lagrange ",
    "jacobi relation @xcite @xmath29 which holds for any potential homogeneous of degree @xmath20 .",
    "then for the newton potential @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 it follows that @xmath33 .",
    "this , in turn , means that @xmath25 as a function of @xmath10 is concave upwards , and ( half ) its time derivative @xmath34 , the _ dilatational momentum _ : @xmath35 is monotonic .",
    "the monotonicity of @xmath34 implies that @xmath25 is u - shaped , with a unique minimum , corresponding to the ` turning point ' of fig .",
    "[ triplepicture ] . at that point , @xmath36 . and",
    "@xmath36 , and solutions that lead to parabolic escape at which @xmath37 and @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "the range of @xmath34 in these solutions is @xmath39 .",
    "these solutions form a measure - zero set with respect to the canonical louville measure on shape phase space , which is obtained as the quotient of @xmath40 ( the phase space of @xmath0 particles in three dimensions ) wrt global translations , rotations and dilatations.[zm ] ]    since @xmath34 is monotonic , it can be used as a physical time variable @xmath41 .",
    "evolution in @xmath41 is generated by a @xmath41-dependent hamiltonian @xmath42  @xcite , @xmath43 here @xmath44 are ` shape momenta ' , defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are ` shape coordinates ' , which coordinatize ` pre - shape space ' @xmath47 , the quotient of configuration space by global translations and dilatations .",
    "one could also quotient by rotations , to obtain ` shape space ' @xmath48 , the true relational configuration space @xcite .",
    "however , this further quotient is technically impractical and does not affect our argument ( as rotations commute with both the hamiltonian and the dilatations ) .",
    "the shape momenta @xmath49 are the variables canonically conjugate to @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "each point of @xmath48 ( a shape ) is an objective state of the system , freed of unphysical properties like the overall orientation in absolute space , the position of the center of mass of the universe , and the total scale .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath51 is a function of time @xmath41 , the shape degrees of freedom and their conjugate momenta .",
    "this allows us to eliminate the evolution of scale from the problem and express the dynamics purely on shape space .",
    "the usual description with scale can be reconstructed from the solution on shape space , for which it is necessary to specify a nominal initial value of @xmath25 ( due to dynamical similarity , this value is completely conventional and unmeasurable ) .",
    "if we ignore the nominal scale of the system , what characterizes best its overall state ? it must be some dimensionless measure of inhomogeneity that distinguishes the central ` turning point ' shown in fig .",
    "[ triplepicture ] from the states either side . to our knowledge",
    ", the objective criterion we now propose is new .",
    "there are two simple lengths that characterize the system .",
    "one is the @xmath52 : _ : = 1 m _ = 1 m _",
    "i_^1 2 , [ rms ] which is dominated by the largest @xmath53 and measures the overall size of the system .",
    "the other is the @xmath54 : : = 1m_^2_r < am_am_br_ab[mhl ] = 1m_^2 | v _ | .",
    "this length is dominated by the smallest @xmath53 and measures how close to each other are the tightest particle pairs .",
    "we obtain an observable on shape space by taking the ratio of these two lengths , @xmath55 and call it the of the system .",
    "it is a good measure of non - uniformity or clustering .",
    "even for relatively small @xmath0 , @xmath52 ( [ rms ] ) changes little if two particles approach each other or even coincide . in contrast , @xmath54 ( [ mhl ] ) is sensitive to any clustering and tends to zero if that happens .",
    "moreover , while @xmath56 grows with clustering , battye et al s @xcite numerical calculations for the equal - mass case indicate that the minima of @xmath56 for @xmath57 correspond to extraordinarily uniform ( super - poissonian ) shapes .",
    "figure  [ 1000particles ] is a plot of @xmath56 for a typical solution with @xmath58 : it shows an obvious secular growth away from the point of minimal expansion . in @xcite",
    "is very like our fig .",
    "[ 1000particles ] . in both cases",
    "the most uniform state of the universe occurs symmetrically in the middle .",
    "] we will show below how this can be understood as an intrinsic property of the dynamics on shape space .",
    "notice that @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ timedephamiltonian ] ) plays the role of the potential that attracts the system towards more inhomogeneous shapes .",
    "also , @xmath56 has minima and saddle points , but no maxima : it is unbounded above .",
    "this will prove crucial for understanding of the system s behavior .     vs.  newtonian time .",
    "this is the typical graph one obtains from a simulation with @xmath58 particles .",
    "there is clear linear growth of @xmath56 on either side of the central ` turning point ' , where the moment of inertia @xmath25 is minimal and the dilatational momentum @xmath34 vanishes .",
    "[ 1000particles],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the dynamics on shape space is described by a @xmath41-dependent hamiltonian  ( [ timedephamiltonian ] ) .",
    "dimensional analysis allows us to eliminate this @xmath41 dependence .",
    "introduce @xmath60 , and divide the shape momenta by @xmath34 : @xmath61 .",
    "these new momenta @xmath62 are dimensionless . in these new variables",
    "the evolution is generated by a time - independent ( autonomous ) hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath63 now , however , the equations of motion , @xmath64 have a non - canonical friction term @xmath65 which spontaneously dissipates the dimensionless momenta @xmath62 .",
    "each typical solution of the @xmath0-body problem maps into two solutions of the equations with friction . ] this and the fact that the potential @xmath66 has no local minima ( only infinitely deep potential wells ) explain why @xmath56 grows secularly either side of a unique minimum .",
    "in the above , we have reformulated the dynamics of the @xmath0-body problem as a dynamical system on shape space whose motion is controlled by a potential @xmath67 and is subject to linear friction .",
    "this explains intuitively why @xmath56 and therefore @xmath68 grows secularly : it is essentially minus the potential energy of a system with friction .",
    "moreover , one can use the results of  @xcite to show that typically there is a lower bound on @xmath56 that grows without bound for large @xmath69 .. however , we have to assume that at least one bound system forms , and no particle escapes in finite times like in xia s solution @xcite . ]    in the light of this circumstance , it is very natural _ to identify an arrow of time with the direction in which structure , measured in our case by @xmath56 , grows .",
    "_ we then have a dynamically - enforced scenario with one past ( the minimum of @xmath56 , which occurs near @xmath70 ) and two futures .",
    "the growth - of - complexity arrow always points away from the unique past . in the atypical solutions that terminate with @xmath71 ( footnote [ zm ] )",
    "there is one past and only one future @xcite .",
    "our evidence for the passage of time is in locally stored records ( including memory ) , which , by agreeing with each other , lead us to believe in a dynamical law that has generated them from a unique past @xcite .",
    "complexity is a prerequisite for storage of information in local subsystems and therefore the formation of records .",
    "we now note that a notion of local records can be found in a model as simple as our @xmath72 @xmath0-body problem .",
    "recall that the system , for large @xmath73 , breaks up typically into disjoint subsystems drifting apart linearly in newtonian time @xmath10 .",
    "these subsystems get more and more isolated , and one can associate dynamically generated local information with them . for this",
    ", we use the result of marchal and saari @xcite that as @xmath74 each subsystem @xmath75 develops asymptotically conserved quantities : @xmath76 here , @xmath77 are , respectively , the energy , angular momentum , and the distance of the subsystem from the centre of mass of the total system .",
    "the quantities @xmath78 are constants to which @xmath79 asymptote .",
    "let @xmath80 be any one of these .",
    "then at any finite time @xmath10 , the quantity @xmath81 will be smaller than @xmath82 for all @xmath83 . here ,",
    "the integer @xmath84 is a measure of how much we know about @xmath85 from observation of @xmath86 up to time @xmath10 and can be defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 means the maximum oscillation ( bounded by eq .  [ marchialsaaribounds ] ) that the quantity @xmath86 can attain after time @xmath10 .",
    "essentially @xmath84 is the number of decimal digits of @xmath85 that we know after time @xmath10 ( with the caveat that in a decimal representation @xmath89 ) .",
    "it s easy to see how the bounds  ( [ marchialsaaribounds ] ) imply a monotonic growth of @xmath90 .",
    "this growth goes along with the growth of @xmath56 , and for the same reason : namely , the subsystems get more and more isolated from each other .",
    "in the foregoing , we eliminated from the dynamics both newtonian time @xmath10 and scale ( represented by @xmath25 ) . although extraneous and superfluous for the shape dynamics , it is interesting to see how they emerge as _ effective _ concepts .    at late @xmath41 s typical solutions will contain bound systems , like kepler pairs .",
    "these will be stably bound for a long interval of @xmath41 ( many of them forever ) .",
    "a kepler pair is characterized by an orbital period , a major axis , and a direction of the angular momentum .",
    "as we just noted , these quantities are almost constant , in the sense that they fluctuate around constant values .",
    "so each well isolated kepler pair represents a physical rod and clock , and a frame of reference ( because it provides almost - inertial axes ) .",
    "the motions of particles near a kepler pair , measured by the scale provided by the semimajor axis and the clock provided by the orbital period , are therefore very well approximated by newton s equations in the frame defined by the direction of angular momentum and orbital axes .",
    "thus , in the asymptotic regime , newtonian physics and a newtonian framework of space and time in which it holds both emerge spontaneously from a dynamics of shapes with friction .",
    "we do not propose the @xmath0-body model as a phenomenological model for cosmology ; rather it serves as a toy model to explain a new mechanism .",
    "a good cosmological model requires general relativity ( gr ) , which , as we will argue in this section , possesses the right properties to give rise to the same mechanism .",
    "however , if the @xmath0-body problem was interpreted literally as a ( coarse - grained ) cosmological model ( e.g. , as a model for the evolution of the distribution of galaxies ) , one would need to include a positive cosmological constant .",
    "this does not , for the observed value , disrupt bound systems and actually enhances the growth of complexity as we defined it ( it increases the @xmath52 factor without affecting the @xmath54 factor significantly ) .    as we said , the architectonic features of newtonian gravity that , as we have shown , generate arrows of time , are also present in gr .",
    "gr can be described in a conformally - invariant way through the theory called shape dynamics ( sd ) @xcite .",
    "this theory involves only conformally - invariant degrees of freedom , plus a single and global scale degree of freedom , which can be identified with the total volume @xmath91 of a compact spatial slice of constant mean extrinsic curvature ( cmc ) in spacetime .    in sd",
    ", @xmath91 plays the same role as @xmath25 in the @xmath0-body problem .",
    "its conjugate momentum , known as york time @xcite , is monotonic like to @xmath34 , and can be used as a time variable . in this case",
    "too the dynamics is generated by a time - dependent hamiltonian that can be made time - independent by switching to dimensionless variables and a logarithmic time .",
    "the usual gr description in terms of a spacetime metric can be locally constructed from the conformally - invariant one by solving two elliptic equations , which locally admit unique solutions .",
    "those are the ` lichnerowicz  york equation ' , giving a local spatial scale ( a local version of @xmath25 ) and an equation giving proper time ( the lapse of arnowitt  deser  misner gravity )  @xcite .",
    "our results are a ` proof of principle ' : _ all _ the solutions of a time - symmetric dynamical law suited to approximate our universe have a strongly time - asymmetric behavior for internal observers .",
    "so far as we know , this conclusion is new .",
    "it follows from the exact lagrange ",
    "jacobi relation ( [ ljr ] ) and special properties of the model s potential .",
    "of course , it has long been known that gravity causes clustering of an initially uniform matter distribution . in our universe , this is reflected above all in the formation of galaxies and is the most striking macroscopic arrow .",
    "our novelty is that in all solutions of the @xmath0-body problem the dynamical law guarantees , without any past hypothesis , an epoch of relative uniformity out of which growth of structure must be observed .",
    "we conclude that the origin of time s arrow is not necessarily to be sought in initial conditions but rather in the structure of the law which governs the universe .",
