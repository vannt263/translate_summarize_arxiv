    "half - integer vortices ( hv ) are elementary topological defects in superfluids and bose - einstein condensates with multicomponent order parameter @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by half - quantum change of the phase of the condensate , i.e. , the phase is changed by @xmath0 after encircling the point of singularity . in condensates of exciton - polaritons in planar",
    "semiconductor microcavities , where the order parameter has two components , namely , the left and the right circular - polarization components , the vortex , in general , is described by two winding numbers @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is for the polarization angle , and @xmath3 is for the phase .",
    "the hv is characterized by simultaneous change of both angles by @xmath0 , so that @xmath4 and there are four different hv s @xcite .",
    "higher - order vortex entities can be considered as superpositions of several hv .",
    "for example , the integer phase vortex @xmath5 is the superposition of two hv , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "both the integer phase vortices @xcite and the half - integer vortices @xcite have been discovered recently in exciton - polariton condensates .",
    "the experimental observations @xcite revealed the importance of polarization splitting of polariton branches and , in particular , the presence of pinning of the condensate polarization to a specific crystallographic direction . the hv can be observed only when this splitting is sufficiently small .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present the brief theoretical discussion of the effects of weak polarization splitting on the properties of hv s . in what follows",
    "we discuss two different types of splitting , the wave - vector dependent te - tm splitting and the wave - vector independent splitting due to the cavity asymmetry .",
    "near the bottom of lower polariton branch the kinetic energy density of polariton condensate is @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the transverse ( te ) and longitudinal ( tm ) effective masses of polaritons .",
    "the two - dimensional vector @xmath11 is the condensate wave function normalized to the condensate concentration @xmath12 .",
    "the presence of te - tm splitting does not destroy hv s , but it results in the warping of their polarization texture .",
    "more importantly , it changes qualitatively the hv energies and hv interactions .",
    "we consider these effects below for the case of uniform exciton - polariton condensate without any potential disorder .    in the elastic region , where the condensate concentration is constant",
    ", the order parameter of linearly polarized condensate can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the phase and polarization angles , respectively . in the case of small difference @xmath16",
    ", one can take these angles as in unperturbed case .",
    "namely , in the polar coordinates @xmath17 these angles depends on the azimuth as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the kinetic energy density then reads @xmath20,\\ ] ] @xmath21    the energy of single vortex in logarithmic approximation is found by integrating this expression over the microcavity plane .",
    "the integral should be cut at small @xmath22 by the vortex core radius @xmath23 , and for large @xmath22 by the excitation spot radius @xmath24 .",
    "the core radius is @xmath25 , where the chemical potential @xmath26 can be measured by the blue - shift of the emission line of the polariton condensate .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is typically about a few microns . due to the oscillating factor",
    ", the second term in ( [ kinenergy2 ] ) contributes only for @xmath27 , and the energy of the vortex is @xmath28\\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right).\\ ] ]    it is seen , that the energies of most of the vortices are defined by @xmath29 , but the energy of polarization `` hedgehog '' vortex @xmath30 is defined be the pure longitudinal mass @xmath10 .",
    "this result can be visualized by consideration of polarization texture of integer vortices shown in figure  1 .",
    "for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 vortices [ figure  1(a - c ) ] the polarization field is longitudinal in some areas and transverse in others . for the @xmath30 vortex",
    "[ figure  1(d ) ] the field is longitudinal everywhere .    without te - tm",
    "splitting there is no long - range interaction between the left and right hv s , that is between hv s with the different sign of the product @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the te - tm splitting leads to weak coupling for a particular pair , the @xmath6 and @xmath34 half - vortices .",
    "this can be easily understood since when these hv s are put together they form the `` hedgehog '' vortex with the energy @xmath35 . when this pair are well separated",
    "the energy of the system is equal to the doubled energy of the single hv , that is to @xmath36 .",
    "the interaction energy of these vortices separated by distance @xmath37 is @xmath38    the long - range interaction between left and right hv s can be important for the analysis of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transitions ( without this interaction there are two decoupled bkt transitions @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted also that the interrelation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 depends on the detuning of the frequency of the cavity photon mode from the center of the stop - band of the distributed bragg mirror @xcite .",
    "so , one can have both weak attraction and weak repulsion of the @xmath6 and @xmath34 half - vortices .     showing the polarization texture of four different integer vortices .",
    "arrows indicate the instant directions of the order parameter .",
    "the value of the phase is reflected in the arrow length .",
    "the field is mixed longitudinal - transverse for the vortices ( a - c ) , but it is purely longitudinal for the `` hedgehog '' vortex ( d).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the te - tm splitting is absent for position - independent order parameter . in this section",
    "we consider the effects of the other type of polarization splitting observed in exciton - polariton condensates . in this case",
    "the energy of a uniform condensate becomes dependent on the orientation of polarization .",
    "the corresponding term in the condensate energy density is @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy of the splitting and we have chosen the @xmath41-axis along the direction of polarization pinning ( the easy axis for polarization ) , so that the energy of the condensate is minimized for the horizontal polarization .",
    "below we consider the case of weak pinning , when the energy of splitting @xmath42 and the characteristic length @xmath43 .    in conditions of _ cw _ excitation one can expect that the hv will be formed with the polarization texture that minimizes the total elastic energy .",
    "the minimization of @xmath44 for the case @xmath45 gives the equations for the phase and polarization angles , @xmath46    the solution to the first equation describes the same uniform change of the phase angle with the azimuth , @xmath18 with @xmath47 .",
    "however , the polarization angle @xmath15 changes from 0 to @xmath0 only in a narrow region @xmath48 when one encircles the core far away from the center .",
    "this region of rapid change of @xmath15 defines a string or soliton attached to the hv ( see figure 16.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "formally , the string is defined by the line where polarization becomes vertical .",
    "the numerical solution to the sine - gordon equation ( [ sinegordon ] ) is shown in figure  2(a ) .",
    "it was calculated with the boundary condition @xmath49 near the core ( @xmath50 ) with the winding number @xmath51 .",
    "the axes are chosen such that @xmath41-axis is directed to the right and @xmath52-axis is directed downwards , so that the azimuth @xmath53 increases for the clockwise rotation . for large @xmath54 ,",
    "the gradient of @xmath15 is zero almost everywhere , except the region of large negative @xmath52 and @xmath55 , where the angle changes according to the known kink solution @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this way the solution in figure  2(a ) describes the hv with the string going upwards .    in general , any orientation of the string is possible and hv s with the strings oriented differently have the same energy for the case @xmath45 .",
    "note that the string carries the energy proportional to its length . in finite size condensates",
    "the string can terminate on the boundary . in this case",
    "the hv will be attracted by the boundary and can relax towards it .",
    "the string can terminate also in another hv with the opposite sign of the winding number @xmath2 , and this leads to the interaction of left and right hv s .",
    "the interaction energy between hv s with opposite signs of @xmath2 coupled by the string becomes proportional to the length of the string and grows linearly with the distance .",
    "the behavior of the interference fringes in two circular polarizations is shown in figure  2(b , c ) for the string terminating into the @xmath6 half - vortex .",
    "these fringes appear when one observes the interference of the signal emitted from the polariton condensate in a circular polarization with plane wave of the same intensity propagating in the downward direction .",
    "experimentally @xcite , this plane wave originates from the same condensate but from a different place , where the order parameter is approximately constant .",
    "the signal emitted in @xmath57 polarization is @xmath58 , respectively , and the fringes in figure  2(b , c ) were calculated as @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "one can see that the half - vortex with the string is characterized by an asymmetric fork - like dislocation in one circular polarization .",
    "moreover , the fringes that cross the string are shifted by half wave - length in both circular polarizations .",
    "the choice of orientation of the plane wave - vector to be collinear with the string ( so that the fringes are perpendicular to it ) is the best to observe the string in the interference pattern .",
    "we are grateful to alexey kavokin , jonathan keeling , and igor lukyanchuk for discussions .",

    "the solid lines are drawn for the values of @xmath15 changing from 0 to @xmath61 ( on the line going downwards ) with the step @xmath62 .",
