    "the nature of qcd matter at high temperatures and densities has been of interest due to the experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider(rhic ) in bnl , new york and the upcoming large hadron collider(lhc ) in cern , geneva .",
    "theoretically , it is expected that the spontaneously broken chiral symmetries at low temperatures are restored at high temperatures . while lattice methods have been very effective in predicting the transition temperature as well as the nature of the the strongly interacting matter near the transition temperature , fermions with exact chiral symmetry on lattice are important for such a study of the chiral phase transition .",
    "kaplan@xcite proposed to define fermions with exact chiral symmetry on a five - dimensional ( 5-d ) lattice with a mass term @xmath2 in the form a step function(domain wall ) and with an infinite extent along the fifth dimension .",
    "the massless 4-d fermions are obtained as localized on the wall , and are hence known as the domain wall fermions . on a finite lattice needed for numerical simulations , however ,",
    "fermions of both chiralities exist with an exponentially small overlap between the respective chiral states@xcite .",
    "currently , the most popularly used fermions in qcd simulations at finite temperatures / densities are the staggered fermions which have only a remnant chiral symmetry on the lattice .",
    "moreover , they explicitly break spin and flavor symmetries .",
    "the full chiral symmetry for these fermions is recovered only in the continuum limit , i.e. , in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing . in spite of the ( exponentially small in @xmath0 , the number of sites in the fifth dimension ) chiral violation on the lattice , the domain wall fermions are more promising than the staggered fermions due to their exact flavor and spin symmetry on the lattice . on the other hand",
    "these are more expensive to simulate as the computational cost increases linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "one has to optimize @xmath0 and @xmath2 for full qcd simulations . in order to gain insights on ways to minimize the lattice cut - off effects we study various thermodynamic quantities of free domain wall fermions as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath0 with an aim to optimize the irrelevant lattice parameters for faster convergence to their continuum values .",
    "we find that by adjusting the domain wall height @xmath2 in the range @xmath7 rather than the frequently used choice of @xmath8 , a faster convergence to the continuum results for both finite and infinite values of @xmath0 is achieved .",
    "however , the cut - off effects are seen to be quite large on small lattices with temporal extent of 4 - 6 where most of the current qcd simulations are being done .",
    "we therefore examine modifications of the domain wall , as well as the overlap kernel to minimize such corrections for small lattice sizes .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we compute the energy density of free domain wall quarks on the lattice analytically and verify that it yields the correct continuum limit . in section iii , the same quantity is computed numerically and the various lattice parameters for which the convergence to the continuum is fastest are estimated . in section iv , we repeat the calculations of energy density in the presence of chemical potential and susceptibility and confirm that this optimum m - range does not shift significantly . in section",
    "v , we propose a method of reducing the lattice cut - off corrections to thermodynamic quantities on small lattice sizes , computed using both the chiral fermions , namely the domain wall at infinite @xmath0 and the overlap fermions .",
    "this helps in faster convergence to the continuum results even for @xmath8 .",
    "the domain wall fermions@xcite in the continuum are defined on a 5d space - time with the mass term in the fifth dimension in form of a domain wall @xmath9 .",
    "this helps in localizing a fermion of definite chirality on the domain wall .",
    "the domain wall operator in the continuum is given as , @xmath10 the massless fermion modes in 4-d are obtained when the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "@xmath11 it was shown that only one normalizable solution exist , bounded to the wall at @xmath12 where the @xmath13 changes abruptly .",
    "the corresponding analog of the domain wall term on the lattice is of the form @xmath14 on the lattice we do not get a single massless mode by discretizing eq . ( [ eqn : dwc ] ) .",
    "this is because the lattice regulator is anomaly free , so massless fermions of both handedness exist on the lattice .",
    "a wilson term is needed to spatially separate the left and the right handed fermions in the 5th dimension by localizing them on the domain wall and the anti - domain wall respectively which are separated from each other by the lattice extent in the fifth dimension @xmath0 . to obtain thermodynamical quantities of free fermions with exact chiral symmetry on the lattice in 4-d , we need to divide out contribution of the heavy fermion modes which exist in the fifth dimension .",
    "this is done by subtracting a pseudo - fermion action@xcite from the standard 5-d action .",
    "following shamir@xcite , the domain wall fermion action on a @xmath15 anisotropic lattice with lattice spacings of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the three spatial , the temporal and the fifth dimension respectively can be written as , @xmath19\\psi(x',s'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the boundary conditions @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the chiral projectors and @xmath22 is the bare quark mass in lattice units .",

    "assuming periodic boundary conditions along the spatial directions we obtain @xmath37 it is to be noted that @xmath2 , the height of the domain wall on the lattice , is bound to @xmath38 to simulate one flavor quark on the lattice .",
    "to suppress the heavy mode contributions and recover a single chiral fermion , pseudo - fermion fields are introduced which have the same action but with @xmath39 i.e with anti - periodic boundary condition in the fifth dimension@xcite .",

    "the lattice cut - off effects are however very large for small @xmath61 = 4 - 8 . by systematically removing the dominant correction terms to the continuum value of the chiral fermion operators we have achieved a faster convergence to the continuum as well as small @xmath144 corrections for small lattice sizes even for @xmath8 .",
