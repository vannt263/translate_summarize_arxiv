    "total cross - sections at high energies provide significant information about the distribution of the constituents and the nature of their interaction at very short distances . even though qcd is the fundamental theory for strong interactions ,",
    "our lack of knowledge about the confinement of quarks and glue has not allowed a first principle determination of hadronic total cross - sections and hence one has to resort to phenomenological models . over several years",
    "we have developed and refined a model based on a bloch nordsieck(bn ) resummation of soft partons . through it , we have been improving our understanding of the observed variations in the cross - sections , in a quantitative way .",
    "details of our work and its evolution , can be followed through references @xcite .",
    "a short summary of data for various processes and their comparison with our model predictions are discussed in the subsequent sections . given the paucity of space ,",
    "we shall only focus on the energy dependences in @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 reactions and the uncertainities therein present .",
    "in fig.(1 ) , we show a comparison of the energy dependence in different processes . the data show a clear initial fall and eventual rise in the total cross - sections for all processes .",
    "the uncertainties in the data for @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath2@xcite are shown in fig.(2 ) and fig.(3 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this brief survey , we have presented a comparison of our model predictions with available data for various processes .",
    "the bn resummed gluon distributions appear to describe quite adequately the rise and fall visible in the data .",
    "experimentally , there are still significant uncertainites .",
    "theoretically , we need a better understanding of the @xmath4 parameter for the soft part .",
