    "the possibility of achieving greater secrecy by introducing additional randomness into the plaintext of a cipher before encryption was known , according to @xcite , already to gauss , in the form of the so - called ` homophonic substitution ' .",
    "such a procedure is an example of a _ random cipher _",
    "the advantage of a random cipher not present in standard nonrandom ciphers is that it can provide information - theoretic security of the key against statistical attacks , and possibly known - plaintext attacks ( see appendix a and also @xcite ) .",
    "a somewhat detailed description of these possibilities is one of the goals of this paper . in spite of the potential advantages of random ciphers , a large obstacle in their deployment",
    "is the bandwidth expansion , or more accurately data rate reduction , that is needed to operate all previous random ciphers . also , it is not currently possible to generate true random numbers at speeds high enough for random ciphers to operate at sufficiently high data rates ( @xmath1 mbps is the current upper limit for random number generation ) .",
    "the quantum noise in optical coherent - state signals may be utilized for this purpose , and quantum optical effects seem to be the only technologically feasible way to generate @xmath2 gbps true random numbers .",
    "a particular quantum noise - based random cipher , called @xmath0 , that also does not entail data rate reduction , has already been proposed and implemented @xcite at northwestern university . in a previous preprint @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 was discussed concomitantly with that of the closely related key generation system called @xmath0-kg .",
    "since the features of @xmath0 direct encryption are subtle and complex enough , we take the approach in this paper of discussing just the @xmath0 encryption system in its own right , and analyze quantitatively its random cipher feature .",
    "doing so will hopefully also avert many possible confusions with @xmath0-key generation , such as those in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will set up in detail the proper framework to understand and analyze the security issues involved .",
    "note that the present paper can be understood independently of ref .",
    "@xcite , the relevant terminology and results from which are summarized in section 2.1 and appendix a of this paper .",
    "following our discussion of random ciphers in general and the @xmath0 cryptosystem , we show that @xmath0 security is equivalent to that of a corresponding classical random cipher .",
    "we show how quantum noise allows some degree of randomization in @xmath0 without sacrificing data rate , and quantify the randomization by two different parameters corresponding to ciphertext - only and known - plaintext attacks .",
    "we also show how @xmath0 can be operated on top of a standard cipher like aes to provide additional , qualitatively different , security based on quantum noise against known - plaintext attacks on the key . however , information - theoretically , ciphertext - only attack on the key is possible with the original @xmath0",
    ". we will indicate what additional techniques can alleviate this problem , without going into any detailed analysis to be presented at a later time .",
    "generally , only search - complexity based security will be quantitatively described in this paper . finally , we rebut the claims in @xcite that @xmath0 security is equivalent to that of a standard stream cipher and that @xmath0 is nonrandom .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we provide the necessary review of standard cryptography .",
    "in addition , we define the random cipher concept quantitatively and point out the available results on random cipher security",
    ". this sets the stage for our definitions in section 3 that characterize a _ quantum cipher _ and a _ quantum random cipher _ , which are both ciphers in which the ciphertext is in the form of a quantum state . in section 4",
    ", we describe the @xmath0 system in detail , show its quantum random cipher characteristics , and highlight its advantages . in section 5",
    ", we respond to the criticisms on @xmath0 made by nishioka et al @xcite in a further elaboration of the quantitative random cipher character of @xmath0 .",
    "we review the basics of symmetric - key data encryption .",
    "further details can be found in , e.g. , @xcite . throughout the paper",
    ", random variables will be denoted by _ upper - case _ letters such as @xmath3 etc .",
    "it is sometimes necessary to consider explicitly sequences of random variables @xmath4",
    ". we will denote such _ vector _ random variables by a _ boldface _",
    "upper - case letter @xmath5 and , whenever necessary , indicate the length of the vector ( @xmath6 in this case ) as a subscript . confusion with the @xmath6-th component @xmath7 of @xmath5 should not arise as the latter is a boldface vector .",
    "particular values taken by these random variables will be denoted by similar _ lower - case _ alphabets .",
    "thus , particular values taken by the key random variable @xmath8 are denoted by @xmath9 etc .",
    "similarly , a particular value of @xmath5 can be denoted @xmath10 .",
    "the plaintext alphabet will be denoted @xmath11 , the set of possible key values @xmath12 and the ciphertext alphabet @xmath13 .",
    "thus , for example , the sequences @xmath14 . in most nonrandom ciphers , @xmath11 is simply the set @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    with the above notations , the @xmath6-symbol long _ plaintext _",
    "( i.e. , the message sequence that needs to be encrypted ) is denoted by the random vector @xmath5 , the _ ciphertext _ ( i.e. , the output of the encryption mechanism ) is denoted by @xmath17 and the secret key used for encryption is denoted by @xmath8 . in this paper , we will often call the legitimate sender of the message ` alice ' , the legitimate receiver ` bob ' , and the attacker ( or eavesdropper ) ` eve ' .",
    "note that although the secret key is typically a sequence of bits , we do not use vector notation for it since the bits constituting the key will not need to be singled out separately in our considerations in this paper . in standard cryptography , one usually deals with _",
    "nonrandom ciphers_. these are ciphers for which the ciphertext is a function of only the plaintext and key . in other words",
    ", there is an encyption function @xmath18 such that : @xmath19 there is a corresponding decryption function @xmath20 such that : @xmath21 in such a case , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are usually taken to be from the same alphabet .",
    "in contrast , a _ random cipher _ makes use of an additional random variable @xmath24 called the _ private randomizer _",
    "@xcite , generated by alice while encrypting the plaintext and known only to her , if at all .",
    "thus the ciphertext is determined as follows : @xmath25 because of the additional randomness in the ciphertext , it typically happens that the ciphertext alphabet @xmath13 needs to be larger than the plaintext alphabet @xmath11 ( or else , @xmath26 is a longer sequence than @xmath27 , as in homophonic substitution ) .",
    "it may even be a continuous infinite alphabet , e.g. an analog voltage value .",
    "however , we still require , as in @xcite , that bob be able to decrypt with just the ciphertext and key ( i.e. , without knowing @xmath24 ) , so that there exists a function @xmath20 such that eq.([decryption ] ) holds .",
    "we note that random ciphers are called ` privately randomized ciphers ' in ref .",
    "@xcite  we will however use the shorter term ` random cipher ' ( note that ` random cipher ' is used in a completely different sense by shannon @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the presence or absence of the private randomizer @xmath24 may be indicated using the conditional shannon entropy ( we assume a basic familiarity with shannon entropy and conditional entropy .",
    "see any information theory textbook , e.g. , @xcite . ) . for nonrandom ciphers",
    ", we have from eq.([encryption ] ) that @xmath28 on the other hand , a _ random cipher _ satisfies @xmath29 due to the randomness supplied by the private randomizer @xmath24 .",
    "the decryption condition eqs.([decryption ] ) for both random and nonrandom ciphers has the entropic characterization : @xmath30 note that this characterization of a random cipher is problematic when the ciphertext alphabet is continuous , as could be the case with @xmath0 , because then the shannon entropy is not defined .",
    "it may be argued that the finite precision of measurement forces the ciphertext alphabet to be discrete .",
    "indeed , in sec .  2.2 , we define a parameter @xmath31 that characterizes the `` degree of randomness '' of a random cipher . in any case , the definition makes sense , similar to eq .",
    "( [ random ] ) , only when the ciphertext alphabet is finite , or at most discrete .    in the cryptography literature ,",
    "the characterization of a general random cipher is limited to that given by eqs .",
    "( [ randomcipher ] ) and ( [ random ] ) .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . in the next section , we will see that the purposes of cryptographic security suggest a sharper quantitative definition of a random cipher involving a pertinent security parameter @xmath32",
    ". this new definition , unlike ( [ random ] ) , will be meaningful irrespective of whether the ciphertext alphabet is discrete or continuous . before we discuss the above new definition of random ciphers",
    ", we conclude this section with some important cryptographic terminology .    by _ standard cryptography _ , we shall mean that eve and bob both observe the same ciphertext random variable , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "thus , standard cryptography includes usual mathematical private - key ( and also public - key ) cryptography but excludes quantum cryptography and classical - noise cryptography @xcite . for a standard cipher , random or nonrandom",
    ", one can readily prove from the above definitions the following result known as the _ shannon limit _ @xcite : @xmath34 this result may be thought of as saying that no matter how long the plaintext sequence is , the attacker s uncertainty on it _ given the ciphertext _ can not be greater than that of the key .",

    ", a schematic depiction of encryption and decryption with a random cipher is given in fig .  1 .",

    "let @xmath42 be a particular key value .",
    "one can view the key @xmath42 as dividing the ciphertext space @xmath43 into @xmath44 parts , denoted by the @xmath45 in the figure .",

    "the associated partition of @xmath43 consists of the sets @xmath50 that are shown with shaded boundaries in fig .",

    "before we describe @xmath0 , we define some concepts that capture the relevant features of a quantum random cipher .",
    "as emphasized in section 2.2 , we will confine our attention to _ stream _ ciphers .",

    ", @xmath108 is the keystream generated from the seed key @xmath8 .",
    "a few comments will help clarify the definition .",
    "first , note that the tensor product form of the state in condition a retains for a quantum cipher the property of a classical cipher that one can generate the components in the @xmath6-sequence of states that constitute the output of a cipher one after the other in a time sequence .",
    "note also that , analogous to a classical stream cipher , the @xmath54-th tensor component of @xmath109 depends on just @xmath56 and @xmath110 .",
    "condition b is the generalized counterpart of the decryption condition eq.([decryption ] ) for a classical cipher  we now allow a small enough decryption error probability .",
    "thus , the per - symbol error probability is bounded above by @xmath111 .    we now want to bring the concept of classical _ random _ cipher defined in the previous section into the quantum setting .",
    "our motivation in doing so is to show that , for an attacker making the same measurement on a mode - by - mode basis without knowledge of the key , @xmath0 reduces to an equivalent @xmath32-random cipher with significantly large @xmath32 .",
    "since the output of a quantum cipher is a quantum state and not a random variable , we will need to specify a povm @xmath112 whose measurement result @xmath17 supplies the classical ciphertext .",
    "note that in this quantum situation different choices of measurement may result in radically different kinds of ciphertext .",
    "note also that the user s and the attacker s measurements may be different .",
    "our definition of a quantum random stream cipher below will apply relative to a chosen ciphertext @xmath17 defined by its associated povm .",
    "we will also assume that , from the eavesdropper s viewpoint , the same measurement is made on each of the @xmath6 components of the cipher output . in other words ,",

    "while condition qrc - b above appears similar to the condition qsc - b for a quantum stream cipher , there is a crucial difference . in the latter ,",
    "the decryption probability @xmath118 takes into account the possibility that the _ quantum measurement _ ( as well as classical post - processing ) made on the cipher state can depend on the key , i.e. it refers to bob s rather than eve s error probability . in qrc - b",
    ", we are considering the probability of error involved for eve when she decrypts using a quantum measurement independent of the key followed by classical post - processing that is , in general , `` collective '' and depends on the key .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath119 is related to the symbol error probability under this latter restriction while the parameter @xmath102 in qsc - b is tied to the symbol error probability for a quantum measurement allowed to depend on the key .",
    "we see that there are two measurements implicit in our definition of a qrc - one made by the user with the help of the key , and the other given by @xmath113 made by the attacker without the key .",
    "see also item 3 below .",
    "as we shall see , @xmath0 satisfies qrc - b with negligible @xmath119 under a heterodyne or phase measurement attack by eve .",
    "2 .    @xmath32 in qrc - a , as in eq.([gammarandomcipherdef ] ) , is a measure of the degree of intermixing of the regions of ciphertext space corresponding to different key values on a symbol - by - symbol basis . if @xmath113 describes a discrete measurement , a @xmath31 corrresponding to eq.([lambdarandomcipherdef ] )",
    "can also be introduced .",
    "our stipulation that the same povm be measured on each of the components of the cipher output is tantamount to restricting the attacker to identical measurements on each tensor component followed by collective processing .",
    "we will call such an attack a _ collective attack _ in this paper ( also in @xcite ) .",
    "this definition is different from the usual collective attack in quantum cryptography @xcite : in the latter , following the application of identical probes to each qubit / qumode , a joint quantum measurement on all the probes is allowed . in our case , there is no probe for eve to set as we conceptually allow her a full copy of the quantum state . doing so , we can upper bound her performance .",
    "( this is an important feature of our so - called kcq approach to encryption and key generation .",
    "see @xcite for discussion . ) thus , allowing a joint measurement , as also nonidentical measurements on each output component , will be called a joint attack .",
    "4 .   in analogy with the classical random cipher definition eq .",
    "( [ gammarandomcipherdef ] ) , one may wonder why the private randomizers @xmath64 used in that definition are missing from that of the quantum random cipher .",
    "indeed , one may randomize the quantum state @xmath120 to @xmath121 using a private random variable with probability distribution @xmath122 .",
    "however , since the value of @xmath64 remains unknown to both user and attacker ( indeed , the user should not need to know @xmath64 in order to decrypt or even to encrypt in the case of @xmath0 ) , one sees that all probability distributions of bob s or eve s measurements in this situation are given by the state @xmath123 , in which there is no explicit dependence on @xmath124 .",
    "in particular , we mention here that exactly such quantum state randomization , called deliberate signal randomization ( dsr ) , has been proposed in the context of @xmath0 in @xcite for the purposes of enhancing the information - theoretic security of @xmath0 .",

    "see , e.g , @xcite .",
    "4 .   in order to decrypt",
    ", bob runs an identical enc function on his copy of the seed key . for each @xmath54 , knowing @xmath131 , he makes a quantum measurement to discriminate just the two states @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "[ htbp ]    to decrypt in step ( 4 ) above , bob , in general would need a phase reference .",
    "this is effectively provided by the use of differential phase shift keyed ( dpsk ) signals in the implementations of @xmath0 .",
    "see @xcite for details . doing so does not compromise security as we still assume that eve has a perfect copy of the transmitted state .",
    "if the line transmittance between alice and bob is @xmath143 , bob receives a coherent state with energy @xmath144 instead of @xmath145 .",
    "the optimal quantum measurement @xcite for bob has error probability @xmath146 it is thus apparent that @xmath0 is a @xmath102-quantum cipher in the sense of section 3 with @xmath147 .",
    "for the @xmath148 of @xcite , over a distance of 80 km at a loss of 0.2 db / km , we have @xmath149 photons . for this mesoscopic level , @xmath102 is @xmath150 , which is completely negligible compared , say , to the standard acceptable ber limit of @xmath151 , which arises from device imperfections , for an uncoded optical on - off keyed line .",
    "let us briefly indicate how this system may provide data security by considering an _ individual attack _ on each data bit @xmath22 by eve .",
    "under such an attack , one only looks at the per - bit error probability ignoring correlations between the bits . under this assumption , eve , not knowing @xmath131 , is faced with the problem of distinguishing the density operators @xmath152 and @xmath153 where @xmath154 for a fixed signal energy @xmath155 , eve s optimal error probability is numerically seen to go asymptotically to @xmath156 as the number of bases @xmath157 ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the intuitive reason for this is that increasing @xmath130 more closely interleaves the states on the circle representing bit 0 and bit 1 , making them less distinguishable .",
    "therefore , at least under such individual attacks on each component qumode of the cipher output , @xmath0 offers any desired level of security determined by the relative values of @xmath155 and @xmath130 .",
    "while we are not concerned in this paper with key generation , it may be observed that unambiguous state determination ( usd ) attacks on @xmath0 are totally ineffective due to the large number of @xmath158 states involved .    in our security analysis",
    ", eve is always assumed to be at the transmitter so that @xmath159 for her . without knowing the key , however , her performance on the data is still poor as described in the above paragraph .",
    "her attacks on the key are described in the following .",
    "we have assumed that the users can utilize the signal energy @xmath144 to maintain a proper bit error rate without channel coding , despite possible interference from eve .",
    "this does not place a stringent requirement on @xmath143 itself as one can typically go around 80 km in fiber before the signal needs to be amplified . in case eve",
    "s interference is too strong and causes error , it would be detected in a message authentication code which always goes with encryption .",
    "there is clearly no need to do separate intrusion detection in this direct encryption case , but it turns out there is also no need in the key generation regime @xcite which we do not discuss in this paper .",
    "we showed in the previous subsection that @xmath0 may be operated in a regime of @xmath155 , @xmath143 and @xmath130 where it is a @xmath102-quantum cipher for @xmath160 .",
    "we now show , that from eve s point of view , under both a heterodyne and phase measurement attack , @xmath0 appears effectively as a quantum _ random _ cipher according to the characterization of section 3 .",
    "note that the randomization in @xmath0 can also be effected in principle by using an additional classical random number generator .",
    "this is not required in @xmath0 as high - speed randomization is automatically provided by the coherent - state quantum noise .    to see the quantum random cipher characteristic of @xmath0 ,",
    "consider employing the following two measurements for obtaining @xmath113 in the quantum random cipher definition :    1 .",
    "( heterodyne measurement ) @xmath161 2 .",
    "( canonical phase measurement ) @xmath162    to show that the conditions for a qrc are satisfied , let us first consider qrc - b .",
    "it may be shown @xcite that the error probabilities @xmath119 involved are respectively @xmath163 and @xmath164 for the heterodyne and phase measurements .    turning to qrc - a ,",
    "let us estimate the value of @xmath32 under heterodyne and phase measurement .",
    "for a signal energy @xmath155 , the heterodyne measurement is gaussian distributed around the transmitted amplitude with a standard deviation of @xmath156 for each quadrature while the phase measurement has an approximately lorentzian distribution around the transmitted phase with standard deviation @xmath165 . if we assume that , given a certain transmitted amplitude / phase , the possible ciphertext values are uniformly distributed within a standard deviation on either side and ciphertext values outside this range are not reached ( this will be called the _ wedge approximation _ ) , we get the following estimates @xmath166 and @xmath167 for the number of keystream values @xmath56 covered by the quantum noise under heterodyne and phase measurements : @xmath168 if the value of the randomizer @xmath24 is fixed ( corresponding to rotation by a given angle within the wedge ) , @xmath131 is fixed by the plaintext and ciphertext .",
    "thus we have according to eq .",
    "( [ gammarandomcipherdef ] ) that @xmath169 and that @xmath170 as expected , the @xmath32 s of both measurements increase as the number of bases @xmath130 increases , and decrease with increasing signal energy @xmath155 that corresponds to decreasing quantum noise .",

    "5.2 in connection with the nishioka group attack .",
    "the relevance of these parameters for security is considered in detail in the next subsection and in sec .",
    "5.2 .      before discussing @xmath0 security",
    ", we comment that @xmath0 direct encryption is often compared to bb84 key generation followed by the use of the generated key in either one - time pad or a standard cipher like aes .",
    "this is not an appropriate comparison because @xmath0 already assumes that the users share a key .",
    "perhaps the source of the confusion is that both @xmath0 and bb84 involve the use of quantum states . in any case",
    ", the appropriate comparison would be between @xmath0 and a standard cipher like one - time pad or aes - we do make such a comparison in the following .",
    "we will consider in turn the information - theoretic ( it ) and _ complexity - theoretic ( ct ) _ security of @xmath0 .",
    "in standard cryptography , no rigorous result is known about the quantitative security level of any cipher , save the one - time pad . since @xmath0 includes a classical stream cipher enc ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we may in general expect a similarly murky state of affairs regarding its quantitative security .",
    "however , it will turn out that , under known - plaintext attacks , one can claim _ additional _ security from the physical coherent - state noise for a suitably modified @xmath0 with any cipher enc , as compared to enc alone .      considering first it security ,",
    "we discuss in turn qualitatively the cases of ciphertext - only , known - plaintext , and statistical attacks on the data as well as the key .",
    "subsequently , for the former two cases , we give lower bounds for the unicity distances @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( see appendix a for definitions ) .",
    "as mentioned in appendix a , for a nondegenerate enc box cipher , one can protect the key completely and attain data security up to the shannon limit under cta .",
    "if the same enc box is used in @xmath0 one may consider , as in sec .",
    "4.1 , an attack in which eve attacks each data bit using only the measurement result from the corresponding qumode .",
    "although under such an assumption it security obtains as @xmath173 , this attack is too restrictive since eve does gain information on the key from each qumode measurement that could be useful in learning about other data bits as well .",
    "such attacks utilizing key correlations across data bits may be launched against standard stream ciphers . under the wedge approximation of sec .",
    "4.2 , eve is able to narrow her choice of basis down to @xmath32 possible values . even if @xmath32 is large ,",
    "the key security ( and hence data security ) is not as good as that of the enc box alone for which case the keystream bits are _ completely _ random to eve .",
    "however , one can still derive a unicity distance lower bound ( see below ) .",
    "this defect of @xmath0 may be removed by the use of deliberate signal randomization ( dsr ) introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , the concrete analysis of systems using various forms of dsr are still under progress . but see @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the case of known - plaintext attacks on the key .",
    "as discussed in appendix a , most nonrandom ciphers have a nondegeneracy distance @xmath174 at which the key is fixed under a known - plaintext attack .",
    "we also mentioned that for random ciphers , such a distance may not exist , so that it is unknown whether or not they possess it security against kpas .",
    "since @xmath0 is random , the same remark applies to it .",
    "however , a finite unicity distance @xmath80 may exist for @xmath0 and other random ciphers beyond which the key is fixed in a kpa . while rigorous analysis is difficult and is so far limited to the unicity distance bound given below , we believe that such is the case for the original @xmath0 with no modification , so that it has no it security for large enough @xmath6 .",
    "the statistical attacks fall between the above two extremes .",
    "thus , there may exist a crossover point where @xmath0 security becomes better than that of the enc box alone as one moves from cta towards kpa .",
    "however , no quantitative results , e.g. , the unicity distance under sta , are known . to summarize , we believe that under all cryptographic attacks , @xmath0 has no it security for large enough @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath175 .",
    "however , the use of @xmath0 should extend the unicity distance beyond that of the cipher enc used in it for some statistical attacks and for known - plaintext attacks .",
    "nonrigorous estimates of the unicity distance @xmath80 against kpa for standard stream ciphers are often made via a capacity argument in the so - called `` correlation attacks '' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the bound @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the capacity of eve s effective channel , follows from the converse to the coding theorem @xcite .",
    "the application of ( [ capacitybound ] ) to correlation attacks is nonrigorous because the assumption of independent noise in each bit is not valid . in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "_ rigorous _ lower bounds on @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be obtained from ( [ capacitybound ] ) because of the independent qumode to qumode coherent - state noise . under the wedge approximation to the noise distribution for evaluating eve s capacity in ( [ capacitybound ] ) ,",
    "it may be shown @xcite that for uniform data , the cta unicity distance @xmath178 and for kpa , @xmath179 in terms of the experimental parameters of @xcite , this gives @xmath180 .",
    "while these are much bigger than @xmath181 bits for english , no precise practical conclusion can be drawn , both because they are just lower bounds and because the actual complexity of key determination as a function of @xmath6 is not yet known . for the numbers above , the cryptosystem would be secure if the optimal complexity is exponential in @xmath6 .",
    "apart from it security , the issue of complexity - theoretic ( ct ) security is of great practical importance .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , we have argued that large enough search complexity security is as good as information - theoretic security in reality .",
    "for standard ciphers , we have seen that there is no it security beyond the nondegeneracy distance .",
    "thus , standard ciphers rely for their security under kpa basically on the complexity of algorithms to find the key .",
    "we now compare the situation with that of @xmath0 . for any attack ,",
    "the mere fact that @xmath182 ( for cta and sta ) or @xmath183 ( for kpa ) does not mean that the unique key can be readily obtained from @xmath184 ( and @xmath5 in the case of kpa ) . for most ciphers",
    ", one needs to run an algorithm to obtain it . at worst",
    ", this algorithm can be a _",
    "brute force search _ - one decrypts @xmath184 with all the @xmath185 possible keys until a valid plaintext is obtained .",
    "this search can easily be made prohibitive by choosing @xmath186 large enough ",
    "@xmath187 used in experimental @xmath0 @xcite is already way beyond conceivable search capability .",
    "a better procedure that we call an _ assisted brute force search _ can exploit partial knowledge of the possible running key values for each bit as follows .",
    "since each basis is specified by @xmath128 bits of the running key , and the seed key is revealed by a @xmath186-bit sequence of the running key for an enc box of fig .",
    "3 that is an lfsr with known connection polynomial , we obtain an _ assisted brute - force search complexity _ of @xmath188 for @xmath189 used in @xcite , @xmath190 which is far beyond any conceivable search capability .",
    "while it is not known what eve s _ optimal _ search complexity is , the advantage here is that this degree of randomization is achieved automatically by the coherent - state quantum noise at the @xmath1 gbps rate of operation of the system .",
    "note also that it is not hard to increase @xmath130 while maintaining the same data rate because the number of bits needed to select a basis on the circle scales logarithmically with @xmath130 .    in practice ,",
    "heuristic algorithms based on the structure of the enc cipher are used to speed up the search .",
    "the rigorous quantitative performance of these algorithms is unknown for standard ciphers .",
    "however , one may view @xmath0 as an `` enhancer '' of security by providing an additional ` physical encryption ' on top of the standard ` mathematical encryption ' provided by the enc box as follows .    for the enc of fig .",
    "3 used as a standard cipher , so that @xmath191 let the unicity distance for kpa be @xmath80 .",
    "let us assume that there exists an algorithm alg(@xmath192 ) whose output is the seed key @xmath193 and that alg has complexity @xmath177 when used with inputs of length @xmath80 .",
    "in order to compare this complexity with that of @xmath0 , we assume that the same enc is used in an @xmath0 system . however , since @xmath194 bits of the keystream output of enc are used to choose the basis for one data bit in @xmath0 , we first match the data stream and keystream in @xmath0 as follows .",
    "we _ expand _ the enc output keystream by applying @xmath194 deterministic @xmath194-bit to @xmath194-bit functions @xmath195 to each keystream symbol @xmath131 to get a new keystream @xmath196 as follows : @xmath197 we then use @xmath198 instead of @xmath199 to choose the basis for each data bit .",
    "the above modification results in the @xmath54-th @xmath194-block of ciphertext @xmath200 being dependent only on @xmath201 and @xmath202 for _ both _ enc and @xmath0 with enc . under a kpa on enc alone , using a known plaintext of length @xmath80 , @xmath203 is known _",
    "exactly_. for enc augmented with @xmath0 in the described manner , it _ may _ happen that because of the randomization of @xmath204 , @xmath203 is not fixed by @xmath205 and @xmath206 . in the latter case",
    ", we have it security above that of enc alone , even though such security may be lost for large enough @xmath6 , as mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "let us assume that , at the nondegeneracy distance @xmath80 of enc , @xmath0 with enc does _ not _ have it security , so that @xmath207 . assume also that @xmath208 .",
    "even in such a case , it appears harder to implement the algorithm alg that finds the key . as discussed in section 2.2",
    ", the reason is that the randomization of the ciphertext @xmath209 , for each @xmath54 , leaves each @xmath131 undetermined immediately after the measurement , even though , by our present assumption , only one possible seed key @xmath8 can lead to the observed measurement results .",
    "if the number of possibilities for each @xmath131 is @xmath210 , eve may need to run the algorithm alg @xmath211 times resulting in a complexity of @xmath212 versus @xmath177 for enc alone .",
    "of course , there may exist a clever algorithm that enables her to do much better .",
    "all we claim here is that @xmath0 provides an additional but unquantified layer of security over that of the enc box against kpa , both in the it and ct senses .",
    "thus , @xmath0 can be run on top of any standard cipher in use at present , e.g. aes ( advanced encryption standard ) , and provides an additional , qualitatively different layer of physical encryption security over aes under a known - plaintext attack .",
    "an interesting point is that , if the above level of ct security against known - plaintext attack is sufficiently high for some data length @xmath6 , there is at least as much security against cta for the same @xmath6 .",
    "however , this comparison may not be practically meaningful as a cta can typically be launched for the entire sequence of data while usually only a much smaller segment of known - plaintext is available to the attacker .",
    "typically , this would imply the attacks can be parallelized . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation is practically favorable with aes used in the enc - see ref .",
    "@xcite , where the immunity of @xmath0 against fast correlation attacks with and without dsr are also treated .",
    "we summarize the main known advantages and rigorous security claims regarding @xmath0 compared to previous ciphers :    1 .   for known - plaintext attacks on the key ,",
    "@xmath0 using an lfsr has an additional brute force search complexity given by @xmath213 .",
    "when reconfigured as in sec .",
    "4.3.3 , it also has at least as much it security as the enc box alone for the same length @xmath6 of data .",
    "2 .   it may , when supplemented with further techniques @xcite , have information - theoretic security against known - plaintext attacks that is not possible with nonrandom ciphers , and would also have maximal information - theoretic security against ciphertext - only attacks .",
    "3 .   with added deliberate signal randomization ( dsr ) @xcite , it is expected to have improved information - theoretic security on the data far exceeding the shannon limit .",
    "it has high - speed private true randomization ( from quantum noise that even alice does not know ) , which is not possible otherwise with current or foreseeable technology .",
    "5 .   it suffers no reduction in data rate compared to other known random ciphers , because bob needs to resolve only two and not @xmath130 possibilities ( i.e , one data bit is transmitted per qumode ) .",
    "it provides physical encryption , different from usual mathematical encryption , that forces the attacker to attack the optical line rather than simply the electronic bit output .",
    "in this section , we discuss the criticisms made by nishioka et al @xcite and respond to them .",
    "this section has some overlap with @xcite ( that was not published ) , but contains new material .",
    "nishioka _ et al _ claim that @xmath0 can be reduced to a classical non - random stream cipher under the attack that we now review . for each transmission @xmath54",
    ", eve makes a heterodyne measurement on the state and collapses the outcomes to one of @xmath158 possible values .",
    "thus , the outcome @xmath214 is obtained if the heterodyne result falls in the wedge for which the phase @xmath215 $ ] , where @xmath216 .",
    "further , for @xmath217 representing the @xmath130 possible values of each @xmath131 , nishioka _ et al _ construct a function @xmath218 with the property that , for each @xmath54 , and the corresponding running key value @xmath131 actually used , @xmath219 with probability very close to 1 .",
    "in fact , for the parameters @xmath220 and @xmath221 , they calculate the probability that eq.([decryption ] ) fails to hold to be @xmath222 , which value they demonstrate to be negligible for any practical purpose .    the authors of @xcite further claim that the above function @xmath223 can always be represented as the xor of two bit functions @xmath224 and @xmath225 , where @xmath225 depends _ only _ on the measurement result .",
    "thus , they make the claim that the equation @xmath226 holds with probability effectively equal to 1 .",
    "they then observe that a classical additive stream cipher @xcite ( which is non - random by definition ) satisfies @xmath227 where @xmath124 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 are respectively the @xmath54th plaintext bit , ciphertext bit and running key bit . here",
    ", @xmath229 is obtained by using a seed key in a pseudo - random - number generator to generate a longer running key .",
    "the authors of @xcite then argue that since @xmath225 in eq.([reduction ] ) , like the @xmath228 in eq.([streamcipher ] ) , depends just on the measurement result , the validity of eq.([reduction ] ) proves that the security of y-00 is equivalent to that of a classical stream cipher .",
    "in particular , they claim that by interpreting @xmath225 as the ciphertext , y-00 is not a random cipher , i.e. , it does not satisfy eq.([random ] ) of the next section .",
    "we analyze and respond to these claims and other statements in @xcite in the following section .      to begin with , we believe that eq .",
    "( [ decryption ] ) ( eq .",
    "( 14 ) in @xcite ) is correct with the probability given by them .",
    "this content of this equation is simply that eve is able to decrypt the transmitted bit from her measurement data @xmath230 and the key @xmath125 . in other words , it merely asserts that eq.([decryption ] ) holds for @xmath231 . as such",
    ", it does not contradict , and is even _ necessary _ , for the claim that @xmath0 is a random cipher for eve .",
    "in fact , we already claimed in @xcite and @xcite that such a condition holds . in this",
    "regard , note also that the statement in section 4.1 of @xcite that `` informational secure key generation is impossible when ( eq.([decryption ] ) of this paper ) holds '' is irrelevant , since direct encryption rather than key generation is being considered here .",
    "furthermore , we have already pointed out @xcite that the shannon limit prevents key generation with the experimental parameters used so far , a point missed in @xcite . see also @xcite",
    ".    we also agree with the claim of nishioka _ et al _ that it is possible to find functions @xmath225 and @xmath224 , the former depending only of the measurement result @xmath232 , such that eq.([reduction ] ) holds , again with probability effectively equal to one .",
    "the _ error _ in @xcite is to use this equation to claim , in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ streamcipher ] ) , that @xmath0 is reducible to a classical nonrandom stream cipher .    to understand the error in their argument , note that , for eq .",
    "( [ streamcipher ] ) to represent an additive stream cipher , the @xmath228 in that equation should be a function _ only _ of the measurement result , and @xmath229 should be a function _ only _ of the running key . while the former requirement is true also for the @xmath225 in eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) , the latter is certainly _ false _ for the function @xmath233 in eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) , since it depends _ both _ on the measurement result @xmath232 and the running key @xmath131 .",

    "( 12 ) of @xcite .",
    "the identity of these sets in turn depends on the relative angle between the basis @xmath237 and eve s estimated basis @xmath238 thus , it is clearly the case that @xmath233 must depend both on @xmath232 and @xmath131 , a fact also revealed by the inclusion of the subscript @xmath232 by the authors of @xcite in the notation for @xmath239 .    notwithstanding",
    "the failure of eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) to conform to the requirements of a stream cipher representation eq .",

    "this equation follows from eq .",
    "( [ reduction ] ) and so by considering @xmath242 to be the ciphertext , the eq.([random ] ) is not satisfied , thus supposedly making y-00 nonrandom .",
    "the choice of @xmath243 as the ciphertext is supported by the statement in @xcite that `` it is a matter of preference what we should refer to as `` ciphertext '' . ''",
    "this is indeed true , especially considering that there are different possible quantum measurements that may be made on the quantum state in eve s possession , each giving rise to a different ciphertext .",
    "this point is also highlighted by our definition of a qauntum random cipher .",
    "however , if one wants to claim equivalence to a non - random cipher for some particular choice of ciphertext @xmath244 , one must show that eq .",

    "no equivalence to any kind of cipher is shown unless one can also decrypt _ with the chosen ciphertext _ and key alone .",
    "however , one may readily see that , taking @xmath245 , eq .",
    "( [ decrypt ] ) is not satisfied , i.e. , @xmath246 .",
    "the reason is that , as we noted from our analysis above of the function @xmath224 , decrypting @xmath124 requires knowledge of certain ranges in which the angle between the basis chosen by the running key and the estimated basis @xmath247 falls . to convey this information _ for every possible _ @xmath232 , one needs at least @xmath248 bits .",
    "it follows that the single bit @xmath225 is insufficient for the purpose of decryption , and so eq .  ( [ decrypt ] ) can not be satisfied for @xmath245 .",
    "therefore , we conclude , that in the interpretation of @xmath243 as the ciphertext , decryption is not possible even if eve has the key @xmath125 . indeed , it is @xmath249 that can be regarded as a possible ciphertext , since eq .",

    "in this appendix , we summarize some relevant terminology and results from ref .",
    "@xcite on the key security of a random cipher .",
    "we first present an overview of the various possible cryptographic attacks possible on a cipher and some early results on the subject .",
    "we also present our result on the security of a nonrandom cipher under known - plaintext attacks . in the process",
    ", we define the important term ` unicity distance ' coined by shannon and broaden it to include the notion of ` unicity distance under known - plaintext attack ' for both random and nonrandom ciphers .",
    "we also define the important concept of ` nondegeneracy ' for both random and nonrandom ciphers that is needed to make the concept of unicity distance meaningful .",
    "finally , we discuss how random ciphers may enhance security against known - plaintext attacks .",
    "the following terminology in regard to cryptographic attacks has bee used in this paper , as in @xcite .",
    "this terminology is not standard , however . in the cryptography literature ,",
    "what we call statistical attacks are sometimes referred to as ciphertext - only attacks ( see , e.g. , @xcite , ch .",
    "2 ) but are also often lumped together with known - plaintext attacks .    by a _ ciphertext - only attack ( cta ) _ , we refer to the case where the probability distribution @xmath262 is completely uniform , i.e. , @xmath263 to eve , so that her attack can not exploit input frequencies or correlations and must be based only on the ciphertext in her possession . by a _ statistical attack ( sta ) _",
    ", we refer to the case where the probability distribution @xmath262 is nonuniform , so that eve may in principle exploit input frequencies or correlations to launch a better attack .",
    "such an attack is typical when the plaintext is in a language such as english .",
    "it is also the attack that obtains when the @xmath264 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) but each @xmath265 is nonuniform . by a _ known - plaintext attack ( kpa ) _ we mean the case where eve knows _ exactly _ some length @xmath194 of plaintext @xmath266 . finally , by a _ chosen - plaintext attack ( cpa ) _",
    ", we mean a kpa where the data @xmath266 is chosen by eve .    in standard cryptography , one typically does not worry about ciphertext - only attack on nonrandom ciphers .",
    "the reason is that , under cta , eq .  ( [ shannonlimit ] ) is satisfied with equality for large @xmath6 for the designed key length @xmath267 under a certain ` nondegeneracy ' condition @xcite that is readily satisfied .",
    "thus , in practice , the data security is assumed to be sufficient if @xmath268 is chosen large enough by adjusting the key length . in this paper",
    ", we would essentially make the same assumption and , with few exceptions , do not discuss data security per se .",
    "however , it follows from ( [ shannonlimit ] ) that no meaningful lower bound on @xmath36 exists for @xmath269 .",
    "a new fundamental treatment of data security in symmetric - key ciphers has to be developed separately . under cta , it is also the case for nonrandom nondegenerate ciphers that @xcite @xmath270 i.e. , the key is _ statistically independent _ of the ciphertext .",
    "thus , no attack better than pure guessing can be launched on the key .",
    "the above two results do not hold for statistical and known - plaintext attacks .",
    "eve can indeed launch an attack on the key and use her resulting information on the key to get at future and past data .",
    "in fact , it is such attacks that are the focus of concern for standard ciphers such as the advanced encryption standard ( aes ) . for stas ,",
    "shannon @xcite characterized the security by the so - called unicity distance .",
    "the _ unicity distance _",
    "@xmath79 of a cipher is the smallest input data length for which @xmath271 . in other words ,",
    "if a plaintext sequence of length @xmath79 is encrypted by the cipher , the ciphertext contains enough information to fix the key ( and hence , the plaintext ) uniquely  the cipher has no information - theoretic security . for nonrandom ciphers defined by eq .",
    "( [ nonrandom ] ) , shannon , in @xcite , derived in terms of the data entropy an estimate on @xmath79 that is independent of the cipher .",
    "this estimate is actually _ not _ a rigorous bound .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that one of the inequalities used in the derivation goes in the wrong direction .",
    "even so , the estimate works well empirically for english language plaintexts , for which @xmath272 characters are found to be sufficient to break many ciphers .",
    "we now consider , in some detail , security against known - plaintext attacks . here , a natural quantity to consider is @xmath273 , since it provides a measure of key uncertainty when both plaintext and ciphertext are known to the attacker .",
    "before we state the main result , we define the notion of nondegeneracy distance .",
    "the reader can readily convince himself that a finite unicity distance exists only if , for some @xmath6 , there is no _ redundant key use _ in the cryptosystem , i.e. , no plaintext sequence @xmath10 is mapped to the same ciphertext @xmath51 by more than one key value . with redundant key use",
    ", one can not pin down the key but it seems that this may not enhance the system security either , and so is merely wasteful .",
    "the exact possibilities will be analyzed elsewhere . for",
    "now , we call a cipher _ nondegenerate _ in this paper if it has no redundant key use for some finite @xmath6 or for @xmath274 . under the condition @xmath275 which is similar but not identical to the definition of a ` nondegenerate ' cipher given in @xcite ,",
    "one may show that , when eq .",
    "( [ nonrandom ] ) also holds , one has @xmath276 so that the system is asymptotically broken under a known - plaintext attack .",
    "more generally , for a nonrandom cipher , we define a _",
    "nondegeneracy distance _",
    "@xmath174 to be the smallest @xmath6 such that @xmath277 holds , with @xmath278 if ( [ nondegenerate ] ) holds and there is no finite @xmath6 satisfying ( [ nondegdist ] ) .",
    "thus , a nonrandom cipher is nondegenerate in our sense if it has a nondegeneracy distance , finite or infinite . in general , of course , the cipher may be _ degenerate _ , i.e. , it has no nondegeneracy distance",
    ". we can readily show ( see appendix a of @xcite ) that , under known - plaintext attack , a nonrandom nondegenerate cipher is broken at data length @xmath279 , in the sense that @xmath280    more generally , for both random and nonrandom ciphers , we define the _ unicity distance under known - plaintext attacks _ , denoted by @xmath80 , to be the smallest integer such that @xmath281 if no such integer exists , the unicity distance under kpa is taken to be infinite if @xmath282 .",
    "thus , @xmath80 is the minimum length of data needed to break the cipher for _ any _ possible known - plaintext @xmath5 . for a nonrandom cipher ,",
    "it is equal to the nondegeneracy distance .",
    "many ciphers including the one - time pad and lfsrs ( linear feedback shift registers @xcite ) have finite @xmath174 .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath174 for nonrandom ciphers , @xmath80 for a random cipher may not always exist . for our definition of @xmath80 to make sense for random ciphers ,",
    "we will impose a ` nondegeneracy ' restriction on random ciphers : a _ random cipher _ is said to be _ nondegenerate _ if and only if _ each _ nonrandom cipher resulting from an assignment @xmath283 of the randomizer is nondegenerate .",
    "then we say it has _ information - theoretic security against known - plaintext attacks _",
    "if @xmath284 i.e. , if @xmath285 can not be made arbitrarily small whatever @xmath6 is . in other words , @xmath80 does not exist .",
    "the actual level of the information - theoretic security is quantified by the left side of ( [ itsecuritykpa ] ) .",
    "one major motivation to study random ciphers is the _ possibility _ that they possess such information - theoretic security .",
    "some discussion on this point is also available in appendix a of @xcite .    even in the absence of information - theoretic security ,",
    "nondegenerate random ciphers can be expected ( see the discussion in section 2.2 ) to have larger unicity distance @xmath80 under kpa compared to the case where the randomization is turned off .",
    "this would , as assumed in cryptography practice , increase the complexity of attacking the key significantly . if eq .",
    "( [ kpabroken ] ) holds when @xmath286 is replaced by a specific @xmath287 , @xmath6 defines the unicity distance corresponding to @xmath287 . the overall unicity distance under kpa",
    "may be defined by @xmath288    the above result has not been given in the literature , perhaps because @xmath273 has not been used previously to characterize known - plaintext attacks .",
    "nevertheless , it is assumed to be true in cryptography practice that @xmath8 would be pinned down for sufficiently long @xmath6 in a nonrandom ` nondegenerate ' cipher .",
    "we now discuss the advantages that a random cipher provides as compared to nonrandom ciphers . for the case of sta on the key when the plaintext @xmath5 has nonuniform but i.i.d .",
    "statistics , the so - called _ homophonic substitution _ method provides complete information - theoretic security , i.e. @xmath289 @xcite .",
    "the original form of homophonic substitution involves assigning to each plaintext symbol a number of possible _ sequences _ of length @xmath210 proportional to its a priori probability in such a way that all possible @xmath210-sequences are covered .",
    "then , for every input symbol , if one of its assigned @xmath210-sequences is generated at random , the net effect is to generate @xmath210-sequences of plaintext with i.i.d .",
    "uniform statistics . these sequences may be passed through a non - degenerate cipher without revealing information on the key as per eq .",
    "( [ keysecurity ] ) . to put it another way ,",
    "a statistical attack has been converted to a ciphertext - only attack .",
    "a generalized homophonic substitution that allows each symbol to be coded into sequences of variable length is discussed in @xcite , for which it is shown that sometimes data compression instead of data expansion results .",
    "unfortunately , this reduction of a sta to a cta does not work for known - plaintext attacks .",
    "however , we emphasize that there is _ no result _ on random ciphers analogous to eq .",
    "( [ kpabroken ] ) with @xmath174 replaced by any definite @xmath6 depending on the cipher , since under randomization , eq .",
    "( [ nonrandom ] ) , and usually ( [ nondegdist ] ) also , does not hold for any @xmath6 . indeed , an inspection of the defining equation eq .",
    "( [ gammarandomcipherdef ] ) for a random cipher ( or fig .",
    "1 ) suggests how a random cipher may provide greater security against kpas .",
    "for a given plaintext - ciphertext sequence pair , eq.([gammarandomcipherdef ] ) suggests that one has some residual uncertainty on the value of the keystream @xmath53 , which does not exist for a corresponding nonrandom cipher . on the other hand , eq.([gammarandomcipherdef ] ) refers only to the per - symbol uncertainty of the key stream calculated without regard to the ciphertext observed for the other symbols in the sequence .",
    "when such correlations are taken into account , the uncertainty on the keystream may be drastically reduced and we can give no general quantitative assertions of information - theoretic security .",
    "note , however , that due to the randomization , the unicity distance @xmath80 of a random cipher under known - plaintext attacks can be expected to be bigger than that of any of its nonrandom reductions .",
    "thus , the complexity - based security would be greater .",
    "in fact , the general problem of attacking a random cipher has received limited attention because they are _ not used in practice _ due to the associated reduction in effective bandwidth or data rate as is evident in homophonic substitution , due to the need for high speed random number generation , and also due to the uncertainty on the actual input statistics needed for , e.g. , homophonic substitution randomization .",
    "thus , the rigorous quantitative security of symmetric - key random ciphers against known - plaintext attacks is not known theoretically or empirically , although in principle random ciphers have actual and potential advantages just discussed .",
    "the point that the throughput for @xmath0 key generation using the optimal quantum receiver principle is low , which we already remarked in @xcite , was also made in @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out here that the throughput can be increased to the level of the original data rate by dsr .",
    "this involves moving the state to the basis boundary with bob utilizing a different matching quantum measurement . for the case of key generation with uniform data ,",
    "the output state is still uniformly distributed on the circle on a per - qumode basis to eve .",
    "however , bob s optimal performance has not been characterized with dsr .",
    "a detailed discussion of @xmath0 key generation will be presented later .",
    "we may observe that the use of dsr in direct encrypion would necessitate the use of an error - correcting mechanism in contrast with the original @xmath0 , and would break the shannon limit ( 12 ) .",
    "the significance and practicality of such variations of @xmath0 have been briefly mentioned in @xcite , and will be treated elsewhere ."
