    "there is considerable interest in modeling traffic behavior via one - dimensional cellular automata ( cas ) .",
    "the original models by nagel and schreckenberg@xcite and fukui and ishibashi@xcite are analyzed in e.g.  , and the more general behavior of sum - conserving cas is considered in . in @xcite ,",
    "fuk and boccara introduced an interesting class of generalized deterministic traffic rules @xmath0 , which display a surprising steady - state behavior : the expected flow of the cars never exceeds one regardless of the constraint values @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    in these rules , as is usual for traffic rules , the road is represented as a one - dimensional lattice where each site has as its value either @xmath4 ( empty ) or @xmath5 ( car ) . under @xmath0 , a block of cars ( ones ) at most @xmath3 units",
    "long moves right at most @xmath2 units , or to the beginning of the next group .",
    "the same rule can also be expressed as follows : at each turn , each maximal match of @xmath6 is replaced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - evolution ] ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . from this representation ,",
    "the dualism between the motion of the cars under the rule @xmath0 and the motion of the empty sites under rule @xmath10 in the opposite direction , as mentioned in @xcite , is obvious .",
    "the `` physical '' quantities of interest in systems that obey these rules are @xmath11 , the density of ones , and @xmath12 , the flow , defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the average velocity of the cars . for finite - length systems ,",
    "we write @xmath12 for the time - averaged steady - state flow from a single state and @xmath15 for the average of @xmath12 over all states . for infinite - length systems",
    ", @xmath12 is the steady - state flow .",
    "the equation @xmath16 expresses one consequence of the dualism discussed above .",
    "there are also other quantities such as acceleration , but these are outside the scope of this article .    in this article , we examine the steady - state flow of @xmath0 , obtaining an exact polynomial equation in the infinite case . in the following sections , we first develop a formalism based on representing the road as a sequence of blocks rather than single sites .",
    "we show that the average flow is fully determined by the number of these blocks in the steady state . in sections  [ sec - simple - limits ] and [ sec - algorithm ] , we use this fact to obtain simple upper and lower limits for the average flow and present an efficient algorithm for calculating the steady - state flow from a given finite initial state . in section",
    "[ sec - exact - solution ] , we consider the behavior of the algorithm in the infinite limit and derive a steady - state condition , which we then solve in section  [ sec - genfunc ] , yielding an analytical solution in the case of an infinite space . finally , in section  [ sec - finite ] , we obtain a non - trivial upper limit for the expected average flow in a finite space .",
    "the flow of cars under rule @xmath0 is easier to understand if the state of the road is considered as a sequence of blocks instead of single cars . as we shall see later",
    ", it is practical to distinguish between _ short _ , _ just _ , and _ long _ blocks , comparing the length of a block with @xmath2 or @xmath3 as follows : a block of zeroes less than @xmath2 sites long is a short block , more than @xmath2 sites long is a long block , and exactly @xmath2 sites long is a just block . for blocks of ones ,",
    "the length is compared with @xmath3 in a similar fashion .",
    "we say that a pair of a @xmath4-block and a @xmath5-block is a _ group _ and define @xmath17 as the density of these groups .",
    "we also define @xmath18 and @xmath19 as the densities of long and short @xmath4-blocks , respectively , and similar symbols for the @xmath5-blocks .",
    "the states of the system can be divided into nine different categories by the existence of short and long blocks , see table  [ tab - states ] . in the following ,",
    "we will consider the three cyclic types of states separately . to verify that these are the only cyclic states we first show that the following two cases are unstable : long and short blocks of one kind , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and long blocks of both kinds , @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "the other cases follow from the same proofs by duality .    .",
    "[ tab - states ] the different types of states in the system .",
    "as discussed in the text , the existence of short and long blocks distinguishes the different types of states . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]"
