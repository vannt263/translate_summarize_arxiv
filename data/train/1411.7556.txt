    "variability can be used to select active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "practically all agn vary on time - scales from hours to millions of years ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "any variability detected in galaxies on human time - scales must originate in the nuclear region , because the typical timescale for star formation variability is @xmath3 100 myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular low - luminosity agn are expected to show stronger variability than the luminous ones ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , variability is likely to be an effective method to select low - luminosity agn .",
    "although the mechanisms that produce variability are not well understood , the main explanations involve disk instabilities ( @xcite ) or changes in the amount of accreting material ( @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to identify agn through mid - ir variability in the goods - south field using 24  @xmath0 m observations taken with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips , @xcite ) on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope ( @xcite ) . the near and mid - ir nuclear emission of agn , once the stellar component is subtracted , is believed to be due to hot and warm dust ( @xmath4k ) in the dusty torus of the agn , according to the unified model @xcite . in this context ,",
    "variability in the accretion disk emission would cause delayed variability in the near and mid - ir as the hot and warm dust , respectively , in the torus react to this change ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our choice of using mid - ir variability allows a novel way to select low luminosity and possibly obscured agn that might be otherwise missed by other techniques .",
    "apart from this work , there is only other ir variability study in the botes cosmological field using irac data ( @xcite ) .",
    "they used the most sensitive irac bands at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m and found that 1.1% of the sources satisfied their variability criteria .",
    "we compiled all the data taken around the goods - south field with the mips instrument at 24  @xmath0 m by querying the _ spitzer _ heritage archive .",
    "this field was observed by _ spitzer _ during several campaigns from january 2004 to march 2007 .",
    "we focused our study on a region around ra=@xmath5 ( j2000 ) and dec=@xmath6 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we divided these data sets into 7 different epochs in order to detect variable sources .",
    "for this study we decided to exclude epochs 2 , 4 , and 5 because their fov is small when compared to the other epochs .",
    "the common area for the epochs 1 , 3 , 6 , and 7 is @xmath71360  arcmin@xmath8 .",
    "they probe time scales of months up to three years , and henceforth are used to study the long - term variability covering a period of over three years .",
    "we also subdivided epoch 7 in three epochs , namely epochs 7a , 7b , and 7c to study the short - term variability .",
    "the short - term variability epochs have a common area of @xmath71960  arcmin@xmath8 and probe time scales of days , covering a period of 7 days .    to study the temporal variability of mips @xmath9 m sources detected in the common regions we built a source catalog for each epoch and subepoch .",
    "we used sextractor ( source - extractor , @xcite ) to detect sources and the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) to perform the photometry following the procedure explained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we obtained a 24  @xmath0 m source catalog for each epoch . in this work",
    "we restrict the analysis to sources above the 5@xmath10 detection limit in the shallowest data in the mosaics .",
    "this corresponds to mips @xmath9 m fluxes of @xmath11jy and @xmath12jy for the long - term and the short - term epochs , respectively .",
    "we also discarded sources with neighbours at distances of less than 10  to minimize crowding effects in the photometry that could affect the flux measurements and produce false variability positives . to identify the common sources in all the epochs we cross - matched the catalogs using a 2  radius , imposing additionally that the 2  criterion was fulfilled in each pair of epochs .",
    "our final catalogs contain 2277 mips 24 @xmath0 m sources detected in epochs 1 , 3 , 6 , and 7 and 2452 mips 24 @xmath0 m sources in epochs 7a , 7b , and 7c , covering an area of 1360 and 1960 arcmin@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "to select the 24 @xmath0 m variable sources we used a @xmath1-statistics method to account for the variations of intrinsic flux uncertainties of each epoch ( related to differences in depth ) .",
    "this is the case for our study as different epochs have different depths and within a given mosaic there are some variations in depth .",
    "the latter effect is most prominent in epoch 7 , which is deeper in the center .",
    "this method associates each flux with its error .",
    "the @xmath1-statistics is defined as follows : @xmath13 , where n is the number of epochs , @xmath14 is the flux in a given epoch , @xmath15 is the associated error in the @xmath16 epoch , and @xmath17 is the mean flux .",
    "we calculated the @xmath1 value for each source without neighbours .",
    "we selected as variable candidates those sources above the 99@xmath18 percentile of the @xmath1 distribution expected from photometric errors alone .",
    "that is , only 1% of non - variable sources satisfy the selection criteria .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath19 for the 4 epochs sample ( 3 degrees of freedom ) and @xmath20 for the 3 epochs one ( 2 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "every object with a @xmath1 value higher than the threshold was visually inspected to remove artefacts .",
    "we also discarded objects that fell close to the edge of the mosaic . after discarding problematic objects",
    ", our final sample contains 39 mips @xmath9 m long - term variable sources ( 0.03 sources @xmath21 arcmin@xmath22 ) and 55 mips @xmath9 m short - term variable sources ( 0.03 sources @xmath21 arcmin@xmath22 ) .",
    "the selected mips @xmath9 m long - term and short - term variable sources represent 1.7 and 2.2% of the original parent samples , respectively .",
    "only two sources are identified as having both , long and short - term variability .",
    "28 mips @xmath9 m long - term and 33 mips @xmath9 m short - term are located in the extended chandra deep field south ( e - cdfs ) .     examples of light curves of two mips 24  @xmath0 m variable sources in goods - south .",
    "the left panel corresponds to a long - term variable source ( four epochs ) and the right panel to a short - term variable candidate ( three epochs ) .",

    "the median 24 @xmath0 m flux is 168  @xmath0jy for the long - term variable sources and 209  @xmath0jy for the short - term variable sources .",
    "this slight difference in the median values of the 24  @xmath0 m fluxes for long and short - term variability is likely reflecting the different depths ( i.e. , 5@xmath10 detection limits ) of the epochs rather than different intrinsic properties of the sources ) .",
    "an estimate of the variability is the ratio between the maximum and minimum values and the mean flux @xmath23 measured as a % : @xmath24 .",
