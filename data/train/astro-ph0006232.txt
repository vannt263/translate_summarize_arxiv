    "in 1919 the central star of the planetary nebula a58 underwent the rare event of a very late helium flash ( `` born - again '' scenario ; iben et al .",
    "@xcite ; iben @xcite ) . for",
    "a review of the object see guerrero & manchado ( @xcite ) and clayton & de marco ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is only one out of two such events in modern astronomy ( the second event was sakurai s `` novalike object '' in 1996 ; drbeck & benetti @xcite ) those objects undergo strong phases of dust condensation ( kimeswenger et al .",
    "@xcite ) . thus , several infrared measuring campaigns focused on this object . while the mid infrared domain was observed with the imaging devices of the iso satellite ( kimeswenger et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in the near infrared ( nir ) only single channel aperture photometry was available ( harrison @xcite ; van der veen et al .",
    "the latter authors give j = 10.25 , h = 9.32 , k = 9.05 and j = 10.32 , h = 9.32 , k = 9.10 respectively .",
    "however , their measurements suffer from low angular resolution and pointing accuracy of the telescopes .",
    "van der veen et al . provide ( tab . 5 therein )",
    "typical errors of 15 - 20   and maximum errors up to 40  for the positional deviation between their nir source and the iras source .",
    "even if they interpret this mainly as an error caused by iras , it contains also a significant contribution from the nir position . modelling the complete spectral energy distribution of this object ( koller & kimeswenger @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the near infrared excess was typically a factor of 100",
    "this is consistent with models of similar objects like v4334 sgr (= sakurai , kerber et al .",
    "@xcite ) . while harrison ( @xcite ) tried to describe this excess by a second component of extremely hot dust , kimeswenger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) tried to explain it as the hot central star obscured by several magnitudes of extinction ( seitter 1987 ) .",
    "the latter model did not hold , as the luminosity of such an object exceeds by far the complete measured bolometric luminosity . to solve this problem , we obtained images at 0.8@xmath0 m , 1.2@xmath0 m and 2.15@xmath0 m using the denis instrument ( epchtein et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) to investigate the exact location of the nir emission .",
    "we were able to find the real flux associated with this source and to identify the nir source misinterpreted as v605 aql by harrison ( @xcite ) and van der veen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the data were obtained using the denis survey instrument at the eso 1 m telescope ( epchtein et al .",
    "@xcite , kimeswenger et al .",
    "@xcite ) on may 7@xmath1 , 2000 8:15 ut . the images were taken simultaneously in all three bands , gunn - i ( 0.82@xmath0 m ) , j ( 1.2@xmath0 m ) and ks ( 2.15@xmath0 m ) .",
    "each band was observed with five images while moving around the source in the field of view .",
    "this was used to eliminate errors due to local flatfield effects and to be able to obtain the sky background using the iso - airmass median sky filtering .",
    "this procedure provides also an estimate of the intrinsic error of the measurement , being better than 0.03 mag .",
    "the flux calibration was done individually using all standards of the night .",
    "we did not use the extinction correction applied for the denis survey ( epchtein et al @xcite ; fouqu et al .",
    "@xcite ) but derived it individually for all three bands . fig .",
    "1 shows the first images of the sequence in all bands .",
    "the optical identification was done using the digital sky survey ( fig .",
    "2 ) and the plate presented by pollacco et al . ( @xcite ) . the near infrared flux for v605 aql ( position marked by a cross ) can be given only as upper limits ( j @xmath2 15.8 , ks @xmath2 13.5 ) .",
    "in the red visual band ( gunn - i ) it is just detected near the limit ( @xmath3 18.0@xmath40.25 ) .",
    "the astrometry was obtained using both , the red digital sky survey 2 image ( dss2 ) and the denis images .",
    "the stars usno a2 0900 - 14547471 , 0900 - 14550145 and 0900 - 14488400 were used as reference and the next nearby tycho2 sources ( about 3  distance ) were used as a control frame to estimate the usno a2 errors in that region .",
    "there is a weak indication for a systematic shift ( using the next nearby tycho stars usno a2 0900 - 14571943 , 0900 - 14569482 , 0900 - 14571215 , 0900 - 14529771 and 0900 - 14582492 ) of @xmath5 = -0.24 , @xmath6 = 0.15 .",
    "as the rms noise is about 0.40 , we did not apply this shift to the resulting coordinates .",
    "although star 0900 - 14550145 has the smallest distance to the core of a58 , it is not usable for precise coordinates .",
    "there are clearly two weak stars blended on the dss2 .",
    "thus , the coordinates for a58 were obtained using only the two other nearby stars mentioned above .",
    "the coordinates then were measured both , on the denis frames and on the dss2 , independently .",
    "the accuracy ( rms ) is better than 0.5 relative to the usno a2 reference frame .",
    "the star marked in fig .",
    "2 by the arrow 34.9  right from the nebula core is usno a2 0900 - 14547471 and has a brightness of gunn - i = 11.73 , j = 10.19 , ks = 9.08 . as there is no other source as bright and having a similar color ( j - k = 1.11 ) , it is most likely the source measured by harrison ( @xcite ; j = 10.25 , k = 9.05 ) and van der veen et al .",
    "( @xcite ; j = 10.32 , k = 9.10 ) .",
    "also the distance provided by van der veen et al . supports this result .",
    "using the model in koller & kimeswenger ( @xcite ) we predict gunn - i = 16.9 , j = 15.0 , ks = 13.0 .",
    "although this is a little bit brighter than the measured flux , it is well consistent with the magnitudes / limits given above .",
    "the models show that at those nir wavelengths already @xmath370@xmath880% of the radiation originate from the gas component .",
    "the input parameters for the gas are still very uncertain due to the lack of good optical spectra as the gas free - free emission , contributes already up to 80% in those wavelengths .",
    "this project was supported by the austrian fwf project p11675-ast .",
    "we thank the denis consortium ( pi n. epchtein , nice , f ) for being able to do these additional observations .",
    "the denis project is partly funded by european commission grants .",
    "it is also supported in france by the insu , cnrs , in germany by the state of baden - wrttemberg , in spain by the dgicyt , in italy by the cnr , in austria by the fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung und bundesministerium fr wissenschaft und forschung , in brazil by the fapesp , and in hungary by an otka grant and an eso c & ee grant ."
