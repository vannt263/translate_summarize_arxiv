    "<S> 4(c)-4(f ) are mainly attributed to fluctuations in the optical phase and the number of photons of the few - photon pulses , which can be eliminated using a biphoton with a constant phase difference ( i.e. , @xmath91 = constant ) . </S>",

    "<S> in other words , the signal pulse made the probe pulse acquire a phase shift of order @xmath1 at the few - photon level has been realized with this double-@xmath0 eit scheme .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated an efficient apm based on a double-@xmath0 eit system at the few - photon level . </S>",
    "<S> a nonlinear phase shift of order @xmath1 induced by a light pulse containing 16 photons was observed in cold @xmath2 atoms with this scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the property of the double-@xmath0 medium can be controlled by changing the phases of the applied laser fields . </S>",
    "<S> this phase - dependent mechanism has been investigated in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional n - type apm based on eit at the single - photon level has a theoretical maximum phase shift on the order of 0.1 radians  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results shows that this double-@xmath0-based apm scheme has the potential to overcome this limitation , making it feasible to use single photons to induce a conditional phase shift of @xmath1 . </S>"
