    "the study of small relative momentum correlations , a technique also known as hbt  @xcite interferometry , is one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to study complicated space - time dynamics of heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "it provides crucial information which helps to improve our understanding of the reaction mechanisms and to constrain theoretical models of the heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is also considered to be a promising signature  @xcite of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "interpretation of the extracted hbt parameters in terms of source sizes and lifetime is more or less straightforward for the case of chaotic static sources . in the case of expanding sources with strong space - momentum correlations ( due to flow , etc . )",
    "the situation is more difficult , but the concept of length of homogeneity  @xcite provides a useful framework for the interpretation of data .",
    "new data from na45  @xcite ( ceres collaboration ) and na49  @xcite experiments at cern shed new light on the evolution of the reaction dynamics at sps energies .",
    "both collaborations showed results of the systematic studies of the hbt parameters in pratt - bertsch parameterization  @xcite for pb+pb(au ) collisions at 40a gev .",
    "taking into account preliminary status of both analyses the agreement between them is fairly good .",
    "the na49 collaboration analysis showed a striking similarity ( including detailed @xmath0 dependence , where @xmath0 is the average transverse momentum of a pair ) between the radius parameters at 40 and 160a gev .",
    "this , coupled with results of the transverse radial flow analysis  @xcite , suggests that the reaction dynamics , despite the difference in the initial energy density and final state multiplicities , are rather similar .",
    "+    the star collaboration has shown  @xcite preliminary results of the extensive analysis of the pion ( both @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) correlation functions measured at rhic in au+au collisions at @xmath3=130 gev . while an increase in radius parameters with charged particle multiplicity was more or less expected , the observed @xmath0 dependence , shown in fig .",
    "[ panitkin_2 ] , is somewhat of a surprise .",
    "the general trend of the hbt radius parameters with @xmath0 is consistent with strong space - momentum correlations due to transverse flow , however , the @xmath0 dependence of the ratio of @xmath4/@xmath5 contradicts the model predictions  @xcite .",
    "model calculations predict the ratio to be greater than unity due to system lifetime effects which cause @xmath4 to be larger than @xmath5 .",
    "they also predict that the @xmath4/@xmath5 ratio increases with @xmath0 .",
    "such an increase seems to be a generic feature of the models based on the bjorken - type  @xcite , boost - invariant expansion scenario .",
    "hence , it was surprising to see that the experimentally observed ratio is less than unity and is decreasing as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "currently , it is far from clear what kind of scenario can lead to such a puzzling @xmath0 dependence . in principle , the observed behaviour is consistent with the creation of an opaque source  @xcite in the collisions .",
    "however , to address this particular possibility seriously one needs to perform a detailed analysis of the pion correlation function in yano - koonin - podgoretski parameterization  @xcite .",
    "+ preliminary results of the hbt analysis presented  @xcite by the phenix collaboration agree with the star results within error bars but do not provide a sufficient cross check due to the limited statistics of the first analysis . clearly , further cross checks of these results by other rhic experiments are very desirable .",
    "+    new results from rhic and lower sps energy significantly extended hbt systematics . figure  [ panitkin_1 ] shows evolution with energy of the pratt - bertsch parameters of the two - particle correlation functions measured  @xcite in central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is evident from the figure that hbt parameters change most rapidly at the ags energies ( @xmath62 - 5 gev ) .",
    "this pronounced decrease with energy is driven by an increase in transverse flow .",
    "growing space - momentum correlations lead to a shrinking apparent source size .",
    "saturation in flow velocity  @xcite ( which is reached around the highest available beam energy at the ags ) leads to a different evolution of the hbt parameters at the sps energy range ( @xmath610 - 20 gev ) .",
    "one can see that transverse hbt radii change very little at sps .",
    "the observed behaviour strongly suggests that the hbt correlation functions directly reflect properties of the collective transverse flow generated in the collision .",
    "+ a consistent picture seems to emerged from the energy dependence systematics of the pion phase space densities reported during the conference .",
    "preliminary results shown  @xcite by the star collaboration seem to confirm the hypothesis of a universal freeze - out phase space density  @xcite at rhic energies .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of the phase space density at midrapidity at rhic clearly rules out a static thermal source and is consistent with a bose - einstein distribution modified to take into account radial flow .",
    "the flow velocity extracted from the analysis of the @xmath7 dependence is quite high ( @xmath8 ) with a freeze - out temperature of about 94 mev .",
    "+ study of the freeze - out phase space density by the na45 collaboration  @xcite also confirmed a universal phase space density at 40a gev .",
    "they also reported that the phase space density seems to be independent of centrality .",
    "+ the e895 collaboration showed  @xcite that at ags energies ( 2 - 8a gev ) the phase space density distribution is lower than the `` universal '' one and gradually approaches it as energy increases . + it was evident during the conference that studies of the correlations of neutral ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) strange particles attracted a lot of attention . even though the details of the final state interaction of neutral stange particles are not very well known , which complicates interpretation of the measurements , the physics which can be accessed via this type of correlations is clearly attractive",
    ". in combination with measurements of strange particles yields and spectra they can provide valuable new information about strangeness dynamics in the collision .",
    "+ from the experimental point of view such correlations have certain advantages .",
    "being neutral they pose no coulomb repulsion problems , and two - track resolution problems are largely avoided as well .",
    "they are also less influenced by the resonance decays . on the other hand",
    "such studies pose significant experimental challenges since they usually require sizable datasets and large acceptance detectors due to the relatively low yields and reconstruction efficiencies of neutral strange particles .",
    "such data were generally unavailable until now in heavy ion collisions .",
    "+ the na49 collaboration presented  @xcite preliminary analysis of the @xmath9-@xmath9 correlations from pb+pb collisions at 158a gev .",
    "the shape of the measured correlation function shows a pronounced dip at low relative momentum which is consistent with fermi - dirac statistics of @xmath9 hyperons .",
    "also there seems to be evidence of weak repulsive @xmath9-@xmath9 potential which may have some consequences for h - dibaryon searches .",
    "this interesting topic certainly requires further investigation .",
    "+ the star collaboration showed preliminary results of the analysis of @xmath10-@xmath10 correlations measured in au+au collisions at @xmath3=130 gev .",
    "the extracted gaussian radius @xmath11 is consistent with pion hbt measurements .",
    "+ the e895 collaboration studied another exotic system - @xmath9-p - in au+au reactions at lower ags energies .",
    "preliminary results  @xcite are consistent with an attractive strong interaction between proton and @xmath9 hyperon but can not be described by the simple source modes with an urbana type potential  @xcite . + the e895 collaboration also showed  @xcite results of the hbt analysis in the impact - parameter - fixed coordinate frame . in this approach event - by - event information about orientation of the reaction plane",
    "is combined with information from two - particle correlations .",
    "such analysis is not only sensitive to the length of homogeneity and time , but also to the tilt of the source in the reaction plane .",
    "experimental access to this level of geometrical detail of the freeze - out distribution is unprecedented , and represents a new opportunity to study dynamics of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in recent years analyses of the event - by - event fluctuations assumed one of the central positions in the experimental studies of the relativistic heavy ion collisions . that was evident during the conference .",
    "+ the na45 collaboration showed  @xcite analysis of the mean transverse momentum fluctuations in pb+au central collisions at 40 , 80 and 158a gev .",
    "they reported observation of small ( @xmath12 ) , but statistically significant dynamical fluctuations at all three energies .",
    "the observed @xmath13 value  @xcite is @xmath148 mev at 158a gev .",
    "this interesting result contradicts the small @xmath15 0.6 mev / c value reported earlier  @xcite by the na49 collaboration .",
    "clearly , this discrepancy requires further study .",
    "+ the na49 collaboration reported  @xcite preliminary results of the analysis of the event - by - event charge fluctuations in central pb+pb collisions at 40 and 158a gev .",
    "they studied fluctuations of ratios of the number of positive and negative hadrons as a function of the width of the pseudorapidity window and applied acceptance corrections following the procedure suggested by bleicher , jeon and koch  @xcite .",
    "fully corrected results are somewhat surprising : fluctuations of charge particle ratios at both energies are similar and consistent with fluctuations produced in a pion gas",
    ". naively one would expect at sps energies somewhat smaller fluctuations consistent with a resonance gas or perhaps even with qgp .",
    "+ the wa98 collaboration presented results of the search for localized fluctuations in the multiplicity of charged particles and photons produced in pb+pb reactions at 158a gev .",
    "they reported individual fluctuations in photons and charged particle multiplicities but no correlated event - by - event fluctuations of @xmath16 . +",
    "the na44 collaboration reported  @xcite preliminary results of their search for local fluctuations in the number of charged particles using a novel event texture analysis .",
    "no evidence of critical fluctuations was found .",
    "+ for rhic , the star collaboration reported  @xcite preliminary results of their extensive event - by - event fluctuations analysis .",
    "they presented an investigation of the charge - dependent and charge - independent @xmath17 fluctuations individually , as well as the overall @xmath17 fluctuations .",
    "a significant excess in fluctuations of @xmath18 mev / c beyond the statistical expectation was observed in the charge - independent analysis .",
    "also , a somewhat smaller but still statistically significant excess was observed in the charge - dependent analysis .",
    "they also studied the centrality dependence of these excess fluctuations where hints of a decrease with centrality in the charge - dependent part was observed .",
    "the results of multiplicity fluctuations analysis show no evidence for predicted fluctuation suppression associated with rapid hadronization of the qgp .",
    "+ event - by - event fluctuations also drew a lot of attention from theorists .",
    "most of the theoretical studies reported at this conference were devoted to the fluctuations of so - called `` conserved quantities '' : charge , baryon number , strangeness , etc .",
    "+ koch discussed the theoretical situation with conserved quantities fluctuations in general and charge ratios in particular .",
    "he pointed out effects of limited detector acceptance and the importance of related corrections .",
    "it was apparent during the conference that current theoretical interest is aimed at the studies of the `` survivability '' of the proposed observables in the real world situation .",
    "most of the results were devoted to the studies of the influence of the system expansion and limited experimental acceptance .",
    "these were discussed in talks by asakawa  @xcite , stephanov  @xcite , gavin  @xcite .",
    "+ pratt  @xcite presented a new observable for determination of the nature of hadronization in heavy ion collision - the balance functions .",
    "the balance function describes the conditional probability that a particle in the momentum bin @xmath19 will be accompanied by a particle of opposite charge in the bin @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "balance functions probe hadronization by quantifying charge correlations in momentum space and potentially allow us to distinguish scenarios with qgp formation from purely hadronic ones .",
    "first experimental attempts to apply this observable to heavy ion collisions are underway .",
    "many new and interesting hbt results have appeared since last quark matter . combined results from the ags ,",
    "sps and rhic allow us to have a systematical view of the evolution of the hbt parameters with beam energy .",
    "presentations of the first results from rhic experiments were some of the highlights of the conference .",
    "the most intriguing feature of the preliminary hbt results from rhic is @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath21 ratio reported by the star collaboration .",
    "it is not clear yet what physics can lead to such a dependence .",
    "+ it would be interesting to perform measurements between ags and sps energy domains , which seems to be a transition region in terms of hbt systematics",
    ". it would be also useful to probe the energy range between sps and rhic .",
    "such measurements will significantly extend our understanding of spatio - temporal evolution of heavy ion collisions .",
    "+ the situation with fluctuation measurements at sps is far from clear and further experimental and theoretical efforts are needed to resolve existing ambiguities .",
    "+ preliminary fluctuations results from rhic are tantalizing and warrant further investigation .",
