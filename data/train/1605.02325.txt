    "thanks to astronomical observations the modern cosmology has elaborated the concept of the standard cosmological model called the cold dark matter model with the cosmological constant ( @xmath6cdm model ) . from a methodological point of view cosmology has achieved the similar status as the particle physics with its standard model of particles .",
    "the @xmath6cdm model acts as an effective theory describing the universe from redshift @xmath11 ( today ) to @xmath12 ( the epoch of primordial nuclesynthesis ) . in the very structure of the @xmath6cdm model",
    "there are essentially two components : matter ( dark matter and baryonic matter ) and dark energy .",
    "it is assumed that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic , and that its evolution is governed by einstein field equations with the energy momentum tensor for the ideal fluid satisfying the barotropic equation of state @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy density of fluid . from the observational point of view",
    "it is convenient to use dimensionless density parameters @xmath15 , defined as the fractions of critical density @xmath16 which corresponds to a flat model .",
    "these parameters are observables which can be determined from astronomical observations @xcite . in the @xmath6cdm model",
    "it is assumed that all fluids are non - interacting .",
    "this implies that the densities of baryonic matter and dark matter are scaling with respect to redshift as @xmath17 and dark energy has constant density .",
    "the natural interpretation of the cosmological constant is to treat it as the energy of the quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "the cosmological model with the cosmological constant term and pressureless matter fits well to the observation data of measurements of snia luminosity distance as a function of redshift @xcite and observations microwave relic radiation ( wmap , planck ) .",
    "measurements of large - scale structures also remain consistent with the @xmath6cdm model .",
    "although the @xmath6cdm model describes well the present universe the nature of its basic constituents ( dark energy and dark energy ) remains unknown .",
    "so dark energy and dark matter are like some useful fictions in the terminology of nancy cartwright @xcite . comparing the value of the cosmological constant required to explain the effect of the accelerated expansion of the universe observations of distant supernovae type snia with the value of the cosmological constant interpreted as the energy of the quantum vacuum",
    ", we get the most incredible gap in history of physics @xmath18 . in this context",
    ", the question is born why the value of the cosmological constant is the small , why not simply a zero ? this is the known problem of the cosmological constant . in the model under the consideration ,",
    "the comparison of @xmath19 still gives 83 order of magnitude from the measurement value because @xmath20 .",
    "another problem related closely with the problem of the cosmological constant is the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "this problem is caused by the lack of explanation of why in today s era of the density of dark matter and dark energy are comparable although it is assumed that they have different periods of recombination . in this paper",
    "we construct a cosmological model in which it is assumed that the process of interaction between sectors of dark matter and dark energy is continuous .",
    "relativistic diffusion describes the transfer of energy to the sector of dark matter . as a result",
    ", we go beyond the standard model assuming from the outset that dark matter and dark energy interact .",
    "this effect is described by the running cosmological constant and the modification of the standard scaling law of the dark matter density .",
    "if we assume that general relativity is an effective theory which can be extrapolated to the planck epoch , then the interpretation of the cosmological constant parameter appeared in the @xmath6cdm model as a vacuum energy seems to be natural . by equating this density to the energy density of the zero point energy that is left in a volume after removing all particles , then we obtain that its value is about 120 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding value required for explanation of acceleration of the universe in current epoch . in the universe with such a high value of cosmological constant ( dark energy )",
    "we have a rapid inflation and galaxies would have no time to form .",
    "the lack of explanation of this difference is called the cosmological constant problem .",
    "its solution can be possible if we can find some physical mechanism lowering dramatically this value during the cosmic evolution .",
    "of course this process should be defined in a covariant way following general relativity principles .",
    "our hypothesis is that diffusion cosmology can offer the possibility of obtaining a low value of the cosmological constant today because the effects of diffusion effectively produce the running cosmological constant .",
    "we study how a value of effective running cosmological constant parameter changes during the cosmic evolution and for late time is going to be a small constant value .    from the astronomical observations of distant supernovae snia and measurements of cmb by planck , measurement of bao and other astronomical observations we obtain that the present value of the energy densities of both dark energy and dark matter are of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "if we assume that standard cosmological model ( @xmath6cdm model ) is an adequate way to describe the cosmic evolution , then the value @xmath21 will depend on the cosmological time or redshift and the question arises : why are two quantities with different time recombination comparable at the present epoch ?",
    "it is called the cosmic coincidence problem",
    ".    we are looking for some physical relativistic mechanism which gives rise to this coincidence observed for the current universe . in the opposite case",
    "very special initial conditions are required for its realization ( fine tunning problem ) . in the framework of diffusion cosmology our investigation of this problem",
    "shows that while the values of dark matter and dark energy densities are comparable today they were significantly different in the past history of the universe . because the diffusion effects act effectively as fluids which interact each other during the cosmic evolution . in the consequence dark energy is running and a canonical rule of scaling dark matter @xmath22 proportional to @xmath23 is adjusted .",
    "the main aim of our paper is to demonstrate how the coincidence problem can be naturally solved in the framework of diffusion cosmology .",
    "the interacting dark energy models have been considered by many authors in the context of this problem .",
    "one of reasons to study these models is to solve the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite . to this aim",
    "different ad - hoc proposed models of an interacting term were postulated  prori . in these models the covariance of general relativity is usually violated and therefore they have limited application to cosmology . in the present work we consider a unique relativistic diffusion model where an interaction mechanism is motivated physically .    in the study of evolutional scenarios of the model under consideration we apply the dynamical systems methods @xcite .",
    "our model belongs to a general class of jungle type of cosmologies represented by coupled cosmological models in a lotka - volterra framework @xcite .",
    "the crucial role in the organization of the phase space plays the critical point located inside the physical region .",
    "the possible bifurcation of this point are studied in details for extracting variability of de and dm density as the function of the cosmological time .",
    "it is interesting that at this critical point @xmath24 ( scaling type solution ) .",
    "haba et al . postulated a particular model of an energy - momentum exchange between dm and de sectors , while a baryonic sector was preserved @xcite . in this paper",
    "we reconsider this model in the light of aforementioned cosmological problems .",
    "we assume einstein equations in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the metric , @xmath27 is the ricci tensor . in this paper",
    "we use the natural units @xmath28 .",
    "because of a cosmological application we assume that the universe has topology @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is homogeneous and isotropic space .",
    "then the spacetime metric depends only on one function of the cosmic time @xmath31the scale factor @xmath32 .",
    "additionally for simplicity we also assume flatness ( @xmath33 ) of sections @xmath34 .",
    "we decompose the energy - momentum tensor on two parts @xmath35    we assume the conservation of the total energy momentum , which gives @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the diffusion constant and @xmath38 is the current , which represents a flow of stream of particles .",
    "we also assume that energy density of the dark matter consisting of particles of mass @xmath39 is transfered by a diffusion mechanism in an environment described by a perfect fluid .",
    "there is only unique diffusion which is relativistic invariant and preserves the particle - mass @xmath39 @xcite . the corresponding energy - momentum satisfies the conservation law ( [ con ] ) .    the friedman equation in the frw metric with baryonic matter , dark matter and dark energy reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are determined by relations @xmath43    the current @xmath44 in equation ( [ con ] ) is conserved @xcite @xmath45 the above conservation condition for the frw metric reduces to @xmath46 with a positive constant @xmath47 which can be computed from the phase space distribution @xmath48 of diffusing particles @xcite .",
    "the condition ( [ con ] ) after calculation of divergence reduces to the continuity conditions for energy density of both matter and dark energy @xmath49 where we assume the equation of state for dark energy as @xmath50 and for matter as @xmath51 ; a dot denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmological time @xmath31 .",
    "equation ( [ darkmatter ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total energy of matter in the comoving volume @xmath54 . from relation ( [ energy ] ) , we can obtain that @xmath55 .",
    "in our paper @xcite we considered one unique model of an energy transfer from dark energy ( de ) to dark matter ( dm ) with the diffusive interaction in the dark sector where de and dm can be treated as ideal fluids .",
    "particles are scattering in an environment of other particles .",
    "if we assume that the subsequent scattering events are independent , the particle motion is described by a markov process . in order , the assumption that the energy of the particle remains finite leads to the conclusion that the markov process must be a diffusion .",
    "therefore diffusion is in some sense unique because there is only one diffusion which is relativistic invariant and preserves the mass @xcite . in consequence",
    "the interaction between dm and de fluids is defined in a unique way .",
    "in the investigation , the dark energy and dark matter interaction plays role in continuity equation .",
    "this equation are special case of jungle cosmological models @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is density of baryonic matter and @xmath41 is density of dark matter .",
    "the equation of state for dark energy is expressed by @xmath50 in our model , where @xmath58 is pressure of dark energy and the equation of state for matter is given by @xmath51 , where @xmath59 is pressure of matter .",
    "the friedmann equation is expressed in the following form @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 . from the friedmann formula",
    "we get a condition @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are dimensionless density parameters .",
    "we can obtain equations ( [ darkmatter])-([friedmann ] ) in the form of the dynamical system @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 is a differentiation with respect to the reparametrized time @xmath74 .",
    "for these variables , the dynamical system is in the following form @xmath75 from equation ( [ condition ] ) , we have the following relation @xmath76 then dynamical system ( [ dyn1])-([dyn3 ] ) is reduced to the two - dimension dynamical system .    for analysis of the critical points in the infinity , we use the poincar sphere .",
    "let us introduce new variables in which one can study dynamical behavior at infinity @xmath77 for these variables we get the dynamical system @xmath78,\\label{poincare1 } \\\\",
    "\\delta'&=\\delta\\left[(1-\\delta^2)(\\frac{3}{2}x-\\delta)-x^2 ( 3x+\\delta-3\\sqrt{1-x^2-\\delta^2})\\right],\\label{poincare2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 .",
    "critical points , for equation ( [ poincare1])-([poincare2 ] ) , are presented in table  [ table:1 ] . the phase portrait for the dynamical system ( [ poincare1])-([poincare2 ] )",
    "is presented in figure  [ fig : fig11 ] .    in the phase portrait",
    "there is an interesting class of trajectories labeled as `` i '' , starting from the critical point 6 and approaching the de sitter state .",
    "because the diffusion has the physical sense only for interval @xmath80 the corresponding cosmological solution should be cut off for any @xmath81 from the de - sitter solution .",
    "hence , we obtain that @xmath82 is positive number , i.e. solution which represent critical point ( 6 ) is non singular .",
    "all trajectories starting from the de - sitter state can be treated as a models of extended idea of emergent cosmology @xcite @xcite .",
    "while in the standard emergent cosmology universe is starting from the static einstein model , trajectories of type i are simple realization of extended idea of emergent universe in which universe is starting rather from the stationary state .    the results of our previous paper @xcite show that the density parameter for total ( dark and visible ) @xmath83 and dimensionless parameter @xmath3 are constrained to @xmath84 , @xmath85 at the @xmath86 confidence level . this domain is represented in the phase space by a shaded rectangle . only these trajectories which intersect this domain are in good agreement with the observation at a 2@xmath10 confidence level .",
    "therefore observation favored the cosmological models starting from the einstein - de sitter solution and going toward the de sitter attractor ( trajectory ii on the phase portrait ) .",
    "note that on the phase portrait there are trajectories labeled as `` i '' starting from the de sitter state and approaching the de sitter state at late times .",
    "they are going toward a saddle point  representing a non - singular solution .",
    "however all these trajectories do not intersect the rectangle and therefore they are not favored by observation .",
    "the saddle point in the phase space is representing the milne universe ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the interacting term is proportional to @xmath87 and consequently is of the form @xmath88 .",
    "the cosmological model with such a parametrization of dark energy was studied by szydlowski and stachowski @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : fig2a ] and [ fig : fig2b ] present the evolution of dark matter @xmath41 as a function of the cosmological time @xmath31 for trajectories of type ii .",
    "the evolution of the cosmological time for matter is determined by the following formula @xmath89    the addictive form of the scaling relation for dark matter ( [ matter ] ) suggests that dark matter consists of two components : the first term scaling like @xmath90 and the seconf term scaling like @xmath91 .",
    "the latter describes an amount of dark energy density which is transfered to dark energy sector by the diffusion process . in the unit of @xmath92",
    "the canonically scaling dark matter is @xmath93 while transfered dark energy is about @xmath94 .",

    "it is interesting to see how different solutions with and without an initial singularity are distributed in the phase space . to answer this question it would be useful to consider a phase space structure of the models under consideration . for this aim",
    "we reduce the dynamics to the form of an autonomous 2d dynamical system . in such a system",
    "the state variables are dimensionless parameters : the density parameter for radiation dark matter and the parameter @xmath3 characterizing the rate of energy transfer to the dark matter sector .",
    "the main advantage of visualization global dynamics on the phase portrait is the possibility to see all solution of the system admitted for all initial conditions . on the phase portrait",
    "there is the geometric representation of evolutional paths of both solution types .",
    "critical points are representing asymptotic states of the system , i.e. stationary states . in order trajectories joining different critical points are representing the evolution of the system .    similarly to dynamical investigations",
    "presented in our previous paper @xcite we added to the plane circle at infinity via the construction of the poincar sphere .",
    "hence we obtain a compact phase space and consequently a global phase portrait . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we have identified linear solutions without the initial singularity as the representing by saddle critical point ( 2 ) . in the phase portrait there are critical points at a finite domain as well as located on the boundary at infinity .",

    "critical point ( 6 ) is representing an expanding stationary de sitter type solution determined by diffusion effects .",
    "we denote as typical trajectories starting from this critical point and going toward the de sitter empty universe . this type of trajectories we called trajectories of type i. in the phase portrait there are also present trajectories of type ii .",
    "these trajectories are starting from the einstein - de sitter universe with the initial singularity and coming toward the de sitter universe labeled as critical point ( 8) .",
    "looking at the phase portrait one can observe that only critical points of type unstable and stable node ( global attractors and global repellers ) and saddle appear in the phase space .",
    "therefore the model obtained is structurally stable , i.e. any small change of its r.h.s does not disturb the global phase portrait .",

    "this implies that the densities of baryonic matter and dark matter are scaling with respect to redshift as @xmath195 and dark energy has constant density . in this paper",
    "we construct a cosmological model in which it is assumed that the process of interaction between sectors of dark matter and dark energy is continuous .",
    "relativistic diffusion describes the transfer of energy to the sector of dark matter .",
    "this effect is described by the running cosmological constant and the modification of the standard scaling law of the dark matter density to the form @xmath196 .",

    "the analysis of the time dependence of density of dark energy and dark matter , we conclude that the value of effective energy of vacuum runs from an infinite value to a constant value , and the delta amendment to the scaling law goes from zero to zero and being different from zero in a long intermediate period",
    ". this characteristic type of behavior is controlled by the diffusion effect .",
    "the paper presents a detailed study of the behavior of a state of the system represented by the state variables @xmath197 . in this context , it was natural to consider the diffusion mechanism which controls the change of the ratio of both energy densities and the very dynamics of this process remains in analogy to the description of population changes of competing species @xcite .",
    "a crucial role plays the saddle critical point @xmath198 , which is a scaling type of the solution ( @xmath199 ) .",
