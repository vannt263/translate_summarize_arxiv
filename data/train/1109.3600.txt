    "in the edge and scrape - off layer regions of magnetically confined plasmas the fluctuating plasma density @xmath0 , the plasma potential @xmath1 and the radial particle flux @xmath2 are usually inferred from langmuir probe measurements . however , the quantities measured by conventional cold langmuir probes are the ion saturation current @xmath3 and the floating potential @xmath4 . following the elementary langmuir probe theory ,",
    "these are related to the density and the plasma potential by expressions involving the electron and ion temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xcite@xcite ) : @xmath7    a maxwellian electron velocity distribution is assumed , secondary electron emission from the probe is neglected and the electron saturation current @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , using the random thermal current density . @xmath10 and @xmath11 specify the probe collecting areas for electrons and ions , respectively .",
    "depending on the magnetic field strength , these areas can be differing for the two species , as stated in @xcite . at any rate , to determine density and plasma potential from the measured quantities , electron and ion temperatures have to be taken into account , although @xmath6 is frequently assumed to be equal to @xmath5 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that in the edge region of fusion devices there is often no data available for the ion temperature .",
    "the measurement of electron temperature fluctuations by means of classical langmuir probes requires a sweeping of a preferably complete probe characteristic .",
    "this results in a lower time resolution of the respective time series compared to data acquired by floating or negatively biased @xmath3 probe pins , although the method has undergone further development towards fast sweeping probes ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , triple probes ( @xcite , @xcite ) or the harmonics technique ( @xcite-@xcite ) can be used to measure fluctuations of @xmath5 . in addition",
    ", more sophisticated probes such as _ emissive probes _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) , in contrast to conventional _ cold probes _ , or _ ball - pen probes _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) have been developed .",
    "these kind of probes are aimed at measuring the plasma potential directly and a combination of cold probes and ball - pen or emissive probes also allows a derivation of the electron temperature @xcite .",
    "nevertheless most probe measurements in the edge of large fusion devices are still based upon data measured by classical langmuir probes . for estimations of the radial particle flux @xmath12 ,",
    "the radial velocity is commonly calculated from gradients of the floating potential instead of the plasma potential @xcite and the density is calculated from @xmath3 using only average values for the temperatures .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use numerical gyrofluid simulations to compare time series of density @xmath13 , plasma potential @xmath1 and temperatures @xmath5 , @xmath6 with simulated values of ion saturation current @xmath3 and floating potential @xmath4 .",
    "the difference between the two corresponding datasets of @xmath1 and @xmath4 is to some extent comparable to the difference between emissive and conventional probe measurements , although the potential measured by the former still deviates from the actual plasma potential by a certain , albeit smaller temperature - dependent factor @xcite .    for the simulations",
    "the nonlinear three - dimensional electromagnetic gyrofluid turbulence code _ gemr _ has been used , which comprises a six - moment gyrofluid model for electrons and ions in a circular toroidal geometry and features energetic consistency ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the coordinate system in use consists of a flux surface label ( @xmath14 ) defining the radial position , a field line label within the flux surface ( @xmath15 ) and a position along the field line ( @xmath16 ) @xcite . for diagnostic purposes , the code delivers time series of fluctuating electron and ion densities , plasma potential , temperatures and parallel velocities , amongst others .",
    "thus , the knowledge of these quantities including electron and ion temperatures allows the calculation of ion saturation current and floating potential .",
    "so the significance of temperature fluctuations with regard to density and potential measurements can be investigated .",
    "moreover , the analysis can be performed at different simulated probe positions in the radial computation domain , which in our nominal case is @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the minor radius .",
    "typical asdex upgrade edge values have been chosen as input parameters for the simulation .",
    "the model can be regarded as global in the sense that there is a global variation of profiles , although the parameters are constant @xcite .",
    "although no turbulence code can as yet self - consistently achieve an h  mode , magneto - hydrodynamic ideal ballooning modes ( ibms ) , which are commonly assumed to cause edge localised modes of type i , can be simulated by incorporating experimental h - mode density and temperature pedestal profiles _",
    "n_(_r _ ) and _ t_(_r",
    "_ ) as initial state @xcite .",
    "ideal ballooning ( elm - like ) blowouts in experiment and simulation are always connected with large fluctuations in density , temperature and plasma potential , so a comprehensive analysis of the temperature influence on floating potential and ion saturation current in this case is a reasonable addition to investigations of simulations in saturated l - mode state .    in the following sections the details of the comparison between plasma density and ion saturation current , plasma potential and floating potential and characteristics of the particle flux in l - mode situation ( section 2 ) as well as ibm blowout situation ( section 3 ) are presented .",
    "possible reasons for the varying discrepancy between the actual quantities and the simulated langmuir probe measurements are also addressed and the role of temperature fluctuations is discussed .",
    "the first situation corresponds to an operation in saturated l - mode .",
    "that means , the electron dynamical plasma beta @xmath19 is chosen low enough not to be ideal ballooning unstable ( @xmath20 ) and electron and ion heat sources as well as density sources are set to a moderate level .",
    "the background mid - pedestal parameters for this case are @xmath21 ev and @xmath22 ev for the temperatures , @xmath23 m@xmath24 for the densities , @xmath25 t for the background magnetic field , @xmath26 cm for the perpendicular temperature gradient length and @xmath27 cm for the density gradient length . for the ion mass ,",
    "the deuterium mass @xmath28 is used .",
    "major torus radius and aspect ratio ( major divided by minor radius ) conform to asdex upgrade values with @xmath29 m and @xmath30 , while a circular flux - surface geometry is used .    the radial domain , whose direction is defined as the @xmath14-direction in the code , is divided into @xmath31 grid points .",
    "these are not equally spaced in terms of radius but in terms of volume , which for the present purpose makes a slight but not decisive difference .",
    "the @xmath15-direction is divided into @xmath32 grid points , the @xmath16-direction into @xmath33 grid points and the averaged grid size perpendicular to the magnetic field is @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 mm ) .",
    "the analysed l - mode time series have a length of @xmath36 data points and a temporal resolution of @xmath37{\\mu s}$ ] ( total duration @xmath38{ms}$ ] ) .    especially in the outer scrape - off layer region of the radial domain ( @xmath39 )",
    "the numerical ( arakawa)scheme occasionally delivers unphysical negative density and temperature values in the presence of steep propagating gradients , arising from gibbs oscillations .",
    "therefore we added the absolute value of the largest negative value multiplied by an offset factor @xmath40 to all values of the time series at all positions , e.g. for the density , @xmath41 = @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the uncorrected time series at @xmath14 and the minimum of all values in the radial domain is used .",
    "as offset factor , @xmath44 has been chosen .",
    "the simulation run exhibits an ion temperature gradient ( itg ) driven interchange overshoot quite at the beginning and then saturates rather quickly to an l - mode - like state . for the analysis and the plots presented in this section only the well saturated part after the initial transient has been taken into account .",
    "[ fig : lmode : raw ] exemplary shows the time series of @xmath45 as well as mean values and standard deviations of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath1 , @xmath45 and @xmath48 at different radial positions ( inside , near and outside the separatrix ) .",
    "both here and in the following parts of the l - mode section , plots showing the temporal evolution of a quantity are based on data taken near the outboard midplane , whereas plots of time averaged data are composed from the individual results of different toroidal positions to provide better statistics . the radial position outside",
    "the separatrix ( @xmath49 cm , red thin lines ) corresponds approximately to the region of langmuir probe measurements in asdex upgrade , which are typically positioned few centimeters outside the last closed flux surface . a separate treatment of parallel and perpendicular temperatures ( @xmath45 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) arises from the construction of moments in the gyrofluid equations @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case there is no major difference between both components and only time series of the parallel temperatures have been used to calculate the quantities of the synthetic probe .",
    "the ion saturation current @xmath3 has been calculated from ion density and the temperatures of electrons and ions according to eq .",
    "[ eq : isat ] ( with @xmath53 defining the cross section of the probe ) . as the characteristics of the @xmath47 , @xmath45 and @xmath48 time series are rather similar , there are no striking differences between the ion saturation current , which is essentially a product between them , with the sum of temperatures appearing as a square root , and the underlying quantities and it still shows a qualitatively comparable temporal evolution .    for evaluations of the radial particle flux from experimentally measured probe data",
    "it is necessary to know , amongst others , the particle density .",
    "although the conversion can easily be done using eq .",
    "[ eq : isat ] , in many experimental cases only average temperature values are available ( e. g. evaluated by sweeping the langmuir probe ) .",
    "hence it makes sense to recalculate @xmath47 from @xmath3 using averaged values of the simulated @xmath45 and @xmath50 time series for each @xmath14-position in the radial domain and to compare the results with the precise @xmath47 time series .",
    "both signals are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : isat ] for a position within the sol .",
    "inside and near the separatrix similar results have been obtained .",
    "the difference between @xmath54 and @xmath47 , given by @xmath55 is particularly large at points of maxima and minima , but rather small elsewhere .",
    "as @xmath56 , the ratio of the actual temperature values to their average values is the decisive factor .",
    "the average temperatures are smaller than the maxima , which results in larger values of @xmath54 at these positions ( the temperatures appear in the denominator in eq .  [ eq : nidiff ] ) . for the minima , the same statement holds vice versa .      fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : phi ] shows a comparison of the plasma potential @xmath1 and the floating potential @xmath4 for a position within sol , computed by means of eq .",
    "[ eq : phifloat ] . a clear difference is evident , as is to be expected , both in mean values and fluctuations . comparing different radial positions ,",
    "the mean offset between @xmath1 and @xmath4 is decreasing from the inside to the outside . in terms of mathematics ,",
    "the difference is caused by a product of the electron temperature in energy units , divided by @xmath57 , and a dimensionless quantity , which depends on the temperature as well :    @xmath58    if the temperature is assumed to be constant , i.e. all temperature fluctuations are neglected , the latter can be understood as average difference @xmath59 between @xmath1 and @xmath4 ( also referred to as @xmath60 ) , normalised by @xmath61 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it can roughly be estimated for our nominal case with @xmath62 and @xmath63 to be @xmath64 .",
    "thus on average the normalised difference for a certain relation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is constant and deviations are mainly due to temperature fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "the background mid - pedestal temperature values used here are only reference values . for all radial positions , but especially within the scrape - off layer the simulated temperature relation can differ considerably from this . consequently , @xmath59 is subject to radial variations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lmode : deltaprof : meandev ] ) .",
    "taking into account that the temperature is not constant results in a fluctuating time series @xmath65 , which is plotted for one exemplary position within the sol in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : delta:3 ] .",
    "the radial profile of its standard deviation is shown as light grey area in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : deltaprof : meandev ] . in the same figure , source and",
    "sink regions of the _ gemr _ simulation model are indicated by dark grey shadings .",
    "the radial positions affected by these mechanisms are removed in all subsequent profile plots , as they should be excluded from the interpretation .",
    "it is important to note , that @xmath65 is the _ normalised _ difference between @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "it can be a useful quantity for rough evaluations , if only average temperatures are available .",
    "a quantitative estimation of the actual difference requires the calculation of @xmath65 multiplied by @xmath66 ( eq .  [ eq : deltaeq ] ) for every time step and for all positions .",
    "thus the shape and phase of the temperature time series , which is varying depending on the measurement position , has a direct influence on the difference between plasma and floating potential .    as the mean temperature @xmath67 strongly decreases within the radial simulation domain , the actual difference @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) between floating and plasma potential is larger inside the separatrix and becomes smaller in the sol ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : deltarealprof : meandev ] ) .",
    "the difference in terms of fluctuation amplitudes seems to be somewhat larger inside and near the separatrix , which is due to large temperature fluctuations in this region , but a significant distinction of the general shape is evident at all radial positions .    in order to emphasise the role of the electron temperature fluctuations ,",
    "a comparison between the temporal evolution of @xmath70 and the quantity @xmath71 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : deltareal : comp ] .",
    "there are only faint differences visible , indicating the predominance of the fluctuations of @xmath5 compared to the fluctuations of @xmath65 and , consequently , to the fluctuations of @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite , the differences in fluctuations of @xmath4 and @xmath1 are determined not only by fluctuations of the electron temperature , but also by the phase relation between temperature and potential .",
    "this becomes evident from the difference of the corresponding root mean square values , @xmath72 ^ 2 - [ \\rm{rms}(\\tilde{\\phi})]^2 = [ \\rm{rms}(\\tilde{\\delta}^{\\rm{real}})]^2 - 2 \\langle \\tilde{\\phi } \\tilde{\\delta}^{\\rm{real } } \\rangle .",

    "[ fig : lmode : xcorr : tephifluct ] shows radial profiles of the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : rmsdifference ] and the two terms on the right - hand side .",
    "it is apparent , that although the contribution of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) is clearly dominant , the influence of the cross phase between @xmath73 and @xmath75 , represented by @xmath77 , is of non - negligible magnitude and radially varying , with largest absolute values near the separatrix and within the sol , but rather small values inside the separatrix .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the phase relation between temperature and potential at different radial positions by means of time - resolved wavelet methods is currently in progress and will be presented in a future work .",
    "the present calculation of the floating potential using simulated temperature time series depends to a certain degree on the artificial offset factor @xmath40 , which has a decisive influence on the temperature averages and therefore also on the mean offset between @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "apart from that , time series of @xmath65 are affected , as the logarithm in the conversion equation eq .",
    "[ eq : phifloat ] reacts quite sensitive on variations of the temperature minima , whose difference to zero is defined by @xmath40 . as a consequence , not only the distinct negative peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : delta:3 ] , but also the radial profiles of @xmath59 and @xmath78 change their characteristics depending on the chosen offset factor . since @xmath40 has no effect on temperature fluctuations , its impact on the fluctuating part and the standard deviation of @xmath68 and on the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : deltareal : comp ] is weak .",
    "that implies , that although the shape of the @xmath65 time series and the mean offset between @xmath1 and @xmath4 is affected by this numerical issue and the artificial offset , the influence of electron and ion temperature fluctuations on calculations of the floating potential can nevertheless be studied .",
    "this applies even more to calculations of the radial particle flux , because only potential gradients are of importance there .",
    "a prerequisite for any considerations about the influence of small fluctuations on potential measurements is the question , whether an experimental probe is in principle able to react almost instantaneously to temperature fluctuations .",
    "this can indeed be assumed , because density fluctuations , which have similar characteristics and a comparable ratio of fluctuations to mean , can be detected .",
    "one of the most important quantities for the statistical analysis of experimental measurements is the turbulent fluctuation - induced averaged radial particle flux ( @xcite@xcite and @xcite ) , defined by @xmath79 where the fluctuating radial drift velocity is assumed to be the radial component of the fluctuating @xmath80 velocity , @xmath81 .",
    "appropriate averaging is indicated by @xmath82 .",
    "the poloidal electric field can be approximated by taking the difference between two potential measurements divided by their poloidal separation distance . in our simulations , this distance is given by @xmath83{mm}$ ] .",
    "replacing the density by the expression for the ion saturation current @xmath3 from eq .",
    "[ eq : isat ] yields @xmath84    both , the synthetically measured particle flux @xmath85 ( using @xmath4 and densities inferred from @xmath3 and averaged temperatures ) and the real particle flux @xmath86 ( using code outputs @xmath1 and @xmath46 ) have been calculated and their temporal evolution , representing the instantaneous particle flux , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : flux ] .",
    "the time series of @xmath85 exhibit much larger fluctuations than that of @xmath86 at all radial positions , but especially inside and near the separatrix , which is clearly visible in the radial profile of the standard deviation of the time - averaged flux ( fig .",

    ", @xmath87 is @xmath88 times larger than @xmath89 .",
    "magnitudes and radial profiles of the mean fluxes @xmath90 and @xmath91 depend on the length of the investigated time range , but significant differences can be observed in any case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lmode : fluxprof : mean ] , @xmath92 times larger than @xmath90 ) .",
    "the use of an averaged temperature value in the density calculation only gives rise to small deviations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lmode : isat ] ) and is not responsible for the large discrepancy in terms of fluctuations .",
    "hence it must primarily be due to the radial velocity calculated from the gradient of the floating potential .",
    "the equivalent use of the floating potential instead of the plasma potential , which is the usual procedure to estimate the particle flux from langmuir probe measurements , is based on the assumption , that the difference between plasma and floating potential is roughly constant at two closely spaced locations .",
    "as only the difference between two adjacent time series is relevant , the error caused by using @xmath4 instead of @xmath1 is expected to be small , depending on different deviations from this constant at the two locations .",
    "such deviations have been discussed in the previous section , but for radially varying positions , whereas here different positions in the @xmath15-direction of the simulation model are of importance .",

    "both the skewness and the kurtosis of @xmath86 are smaller than that of @xmath85 , which indicates , that in the time series of @xmath85 strong deviations from the mean value occur even more frequently than in @xmath86 .    above investigations",

    "[ fig : hmode : fluxprof : aibm : dev ] ) .",
    "as our simulation code can only provide data for the temporal evolution of one single ibm blowout and its aftermath , the fluctuations covered by the time series are not sufficient to allow a more detailed statistical analysis including probability density functions and statistical moments .",
    "from the above investigations can be concluded , that neglecting any temperature fluctuations in our computations of probe measurements results in significant differences between the synthetically measured values and the actual quantities at all radial positions of the simulation domain , both in a saturated l - mode situation and in simulations of an ibm blowout .",
    "this holds especially for the floating potential and its use in calculations of the fluctuation induced particle flux .",
    "the latter shows a considerable discrepancy not only in the temporal evolution but also in statistical properties , if spatial variations of the temperature fluctuations are not taken into account .",
    "however , fluctuations of the electron temperature seem to be of much greater importance than ion temperature fluctuations .    compared to the saturated l - mode situation",
    ", the investigation of time series involving an ibm blowout did not yield a major alteration of the ratio between real and measured quantities , apart from unsurprising changes due to the large peaks .    although a realistic implementation of a virtual langmuir probe in terms of geometry and particle processes would require the use of a kinetic model , the results from our gyrofluid simulations can nevertheless be regarded as relevant for experimental measurements , as all comparisons are performed within the simulation . in this respect",
    "they may serve as an indication to the particular importance of electron temperature fluctuations , whose neglect in evaluations of experimental data might lead to substantial deviations from the actual quantities .",
    "we would like to thank b. d. scott , author of the _ gemr _ gyrofluid model , r. schrittwieser , f. mehlmann and j. peer for their assistance and valuable discussions .",
