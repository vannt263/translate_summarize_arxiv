    "the mechanical properties of glassy materials continuously evolve due to slow , non - equilibrium dynamics , a phenomenon called physical aging @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the response of glasses to an applied load depends not only on measurement time , but also on the wait time @xmath0 that has elapsed since the glass was formed . in general , increasing wait time makes glasses less compliant and increases their resistance to plastic flow @xcite . for glasses formed through a rapid quench from the liquid state , the effects of aging",
    "take a particularly simple form : response functions such as the creep compliance obey a self similar scaling with the wait time and depend only on the ratio of @xmath1 .",
    "the aging exponent @xmath2 has been found to be approximately unity for a wide class of structural glasses moderately below the glass transition temperature @xcite .    however , large mechanical deformation and plastic yielding can modify the aging dynamics .",
    "a primary example of this phenomenon is the observed reduction in the aging exponent obtained through creep measurements of glassy polymers at large stress . since the relaxation times of the deformed glass",
    "resemble those of a younger glass , it was hypothesized that the glass had been `` rejuvenated '' by the stress @xcite .",
    "experiments on a wide variety of materials including polymer glasses @xcite , colloidal glasses @xcite , and even the cytoskeleton of the cell @xcite have shown a similar decrease in relaxation times under high loads",
    ". however , the interpretation of these results in terms of rejuvenation remains controversial .",
    "detailed experiments by mckenna have shown that the time to equilibration of mechanically rejuvenated glasses remains essentially unchanged by the application of external load @xcite , suggesting that stress does not in fact change the extent of aging .",
    "other studies indicate that the apparent enhancement of particle mobility eventually disappears after unloading @xcite , and that the configurational states of mechanically rejuvenated glasses are distinct from the states visited by aging in the absence of load @xcite .",
    "signatures of over - aging due to deformation have recently been observed as well .",
    "for instance , polymer glasses subject to a stress relaxation experiment well below the glass transition temperature exhibit rapid densification for certain strains @xcite . molecular simulations of simple structural glasses show that a small amplitude strain cycle at zero temperature can decrease the inherent structure energy @xcite . also , detailed experiments by lequeux and co - workers show over - aging in systems of dense colloids , which are effectively athermal glasses .",
    "they observe changes to the entire spectrum of relaxation times @xcite : after a period of small amplitude oscillatory shear , the glass appears rejuvenated over small timescales , and over - aged over longer timescales .",
    "the emerging picture of the phenomenology of glasses under load presents some interesting questions that seem to defy a simple explanation in terms of the rejuvenation hypothesis .",
    "firstly , under what loading conditions do over - aging and rejuvenation occur ?",
    "so far , over - aging has been seen only under very specific circumstances : low temperature , small strains , and strain - controlled loading conditions .",
    "rejuvenation , on the other hand , has been observed much more generally in deformed samples , but has been studied most extensively at high temperatures ( only moderately below the glass transition temperature ) and constant stress conditions .",
    "another important question is presented by the work of mckenna @xcite .",
    "what is the nature of the states created by loading , and how do we reconcile the rejuvenated relaxation spectrum with the fact that the time to equilibration is unchanged by the stress ?    a comprehensive molecular model that describes aging and",
    "deformation in glasses is not available to date .",
    "however , phenomenological energy landscape approaches such as the soft glassy rheology ( sgr ) model @xcite have been able to capture many aspects of the rheology of glasses , and have successfully been used to interpret over - aging in strain - controlled experiments at low temperature @xcite . in this study , we will use the sgr model to systematically explore the loading phase diagram in order to better understand the generality and the implications of mechanical rejuvenation and over - aging , as well as the relationship between configurational and dynamical changes .",
    "we perform stochastic simulations of the sgr model over a wide range of experimental conditions and compare the results to molecular dynamics simulations of a model polymer glass in selected cases .",
    "it has been found experimentally and through molecular simulations that the structural relaxation events which result in aging and plastic deformation involve the cooperative motion of groups of approximately 10 - 30 particles @xcite .",
    "the premise of the sgr model is that each of these mesoscopic rearranging domains can be described by a single fictive particle in a rough free - energy landscape .",
