    "after the discovery of graphene , a class of materials , dubbed dirac semimetals , have come to the fore of condensed matter research . in general , a dirac semimetal has several fermi points around which pseudo - relativistic linear dispersion relation is realized .",
    "this pseudo - relativistic energy dispersion forces the density of states on the fermi level to vanish without opening of an energy gap , which is the unique property of dirac semimetals distinct from ordinary metals or insulators  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the recent theoretical prediction  @xcite and the experimental confirmation  @xcite of three - dimensional ( 3d ) dirac semimetals in na@xmath0bi and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 demonstrate that there are a variety of materials realizing dirac semimetals in both two dimensions and three dimensions .",
    "such a diversity of dirac materials requires us to find a systematic way to characterize and classify them .    in general",
    ", the stability of nodal points in a dirac semimetal has topological origin .",
    "this is because there is no characteristic energy scale , such as the fermi energy or the energy gap , characterizing the perturbative stability of the system .",
    "for instance , a nodal point in graphene carries a quantized pseudo - spin winding number that is defined on a loop encircling the dirac point  @xcite . on the other hand , a nodal point in 3d weyl semimetals",
    "is endowed with a chern number defined on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) closed surface surrounding the weyl point  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a quantized topological charge carried by a nodal point guarantees its stability , hence a nodal point can be annihilated only by colliding with another nodal point with the opposite topological charge as long as the symmetry of the system is preserved .",
    "recently , there have been several theoretical studies which attempt to classify the topological invariants of nodal points , and to extend the concept of topological band theory to gapless systems such as semimetals and nodal superconductors  @xcite . however , in our opinion , a proper definition of the topological charge of dirac points in na@xmath0bi or cd@xmath0as@xmath1 has not been given so far .",
    "dirac points in na@xmath0bi or cd@xmath0as@xmath1 are protected by the time - reversal ( @xmath2 ) , the inversion ( @xmath3 ) , and the rotation symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of dirac points in these systems demonstrates their stability , hence the presence of topological invariants associated with them .",
    "moreover , the theoretical observation of pair - annihilation and pair - creation of dirac points  @xcite indicates that the topological charges of the two dirac points should have the opposite sign .",
    "then the question is what the nature of the topological charge is associated with the dirac points .",
    "considering the two - dimensionality of the sphere surrounding a dirac point , the natural candidate is either a chern number similar to the case of weyl semimetals , or a @xmath4 invariant associated with @xmath2 symmetry satisfying @xmath5 .",
    "however , the simultaneous presence of the time - reversal and the inversion symmetries forces the berry curvature to be zero at each momentum , hence the chern number of the dirac point , which is basically the integral of the berry curvature , also vanishes .",
    "moreover , a dirac point can carry a @xmath4 topological charge only in the presence of su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry together with time - reversal and inversion symmetries satisfying @xmath6 as shown in ref .  .",
    "these indicate that a special care is required to find the topological charge of a dirac point in na@xmath0bi or cd@xmath0as@xmath1 , which should obviously be distinct from the monopole charge of weyl semimetals .    in this work",
    ", we will show that the dirac points in na@xmath0bi or cd@xmath0as@xmath1 are characterized by topological invariants of zero - dimensional subsystems defined on the rotation axis .",
    "since the rotation eigenvalue is a good quantum number on the rotation axis , a zero - dimensional topological invariant can be defined by comparing the rotation eigenvalues of the valence and conduction bands at two points enclosing a dirac point .",
    "we find that the nature of 3d dirac semimetals strongly depends on the nature of the rotation symmetry .",
    "namely , the ordinary symmorphic rotation symmetry commuting with the inversion symmetry always creates a pair of dirac points having the opposite topological charges , and generates class i dirac semimetals .",
    "both na@xmath0bi and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 belong to this class .    on the other hand",
    ", we find a different class of dirac semimetals when the system has a screw rotation symmetry . in general , the presence of non - symmorphic symmetries , such as screw rotations and glide mirror symmetries , guarantees a nontrivial band connection at the brillouin zone boundary  @xcite .",
    "also , it is proposed that when the double space group of non - symmorphic crystals satisfies certain conditions , a dirac point can be realized at the brillouin zone boundary  @xcite .",
    "consistent with these results , our theoretical study shows that when the band degeneracy at the zone boundary is compatible with the time - reversal and inversion symmetries , a single isolated dirac point can be created on the rotation axis .",
    "based on this observation , we define a class ii dirac semimetal which is protected by a screw rotation symmetry and the inversion , which are mutually anti - commuting , in addition to the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the partial translation associated with a screw rotation adds a u(1 ) phase to the rotation eigenvalue , which varies on the rotation axis .",
    "this projective nature of a screw rotation enables to circumvent the doubling of dirac points , and create a single isolated dirac point at a time - reversal invariant momentum at the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "we describe the general idea to define a topological charge in systems with rotation symmetry in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] . based on this general idea , class",

    "the classification of dirac semimetals in @xmath8 invariant systems shown in the main text is also confirmed by using the @xmath7 theory approach .",
    "finally , we present a short discussion about the stability of 2d dirac semimetals protected by two - fold screw rotations .",
    "in general , electronic systems having only the time - reversal ( @xmath2 ) and inversion ( @xmath3 ) symmetries can not support a stable dirac point with a quantized topological charge  @xcite . in appendix",
    "a , we have revisited this known fact in a different perspective and proved it by using @xmath7 theory approach .",

    "the non - symmorphic elements are obtained by compounding each symmorphic symmetry operation of @xmath208 with a translation along @xmath209 , which takes one sublattice site to another inequivalent sublattice site . on the other hand",
    ", the symmorphic symmetry operation connects sites belonging to the same sublattice .    at a generic point @xmath210 on the @xmath161 axis",

    "it is worth to note that some symmetry elements contain a partial lattice translation @xmath209 which is the characteristic property of the non - symmorphic nature of the diamond lattice space group .",

    "then it is straightforward to confirm that @xmath223    since @xmath224 on the @xmath161 axis , the hamiltonian on the @xmath161 axis becomes @xmath225 from which we obtain one eigenvalue @xmath226 with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath164 and the other eigenvalue @xmath227 with the eigenvectors @xmath228 let us note that @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 are also the eigenstates of @xmath229 with the eigenvalues @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 , respectively .",
    "since the system is @xmath234 periodic along the @xmath161 direction , a single dirac point protected by @xmath229 can be created at the brillouin zone boundary .",

    "also the band structure of the system along the @xmath161 axis is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : screw41 ] .    before we close this subsection ,",
    "let us briefly perform a group theoretical analysis at the @xmath201 point .",
    "the little co - group @xmath236 at the @xmath201 point with the momentum @xmath237 is generated by three symmetry operators , i.e. , the four - fold screw rotation @xmath229 about the @xmath10 axis , the inversion @xmath3 , the two - fold rotation about the @xmath238 axis @xmath239  @xcite .",
    "one interesting property of the diamond lattice is that the inversion symmetry @xmath3 also accompanies a partial translation @xmath219 .",
    "thus , it is more suitable to use the notation @xmath240 to indicate the partial translation associated with the inversion .",
    "here we describe two interesting physical consequences resulting from the non - symmorphic nature of @xmath241 .",
    "firstly , the partial translation involved in @xmath241 does not affect the commutation relation between @xmath241 and a screw rotation @xmath242 on the rotation axis .",
    "this fact can be easily understood by considering the coordinate tranformation under the combination of @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "assuming the @xmath10 axis is the screw rotation axis , @xmath245 transforms the coordinate @xmath146 to @xmath246 where @xmath247 and @xmath248 are rotated coordinates satisfying @xmath249 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath250 on the other hand , @xmath251 transforms @xmath146 to @xmath252 where @xmath253 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath254 now let us consider a bloch state @xmath255 on the rotation axis with the momentum @xmath256 .",
    "we find @xmath257pc_{n}\\ket{k_{z } } , \\nonumber\\\\ \\widetilde{c}_{n , q}\\widetilde{p}\\ket{k_{z}}&=\\exp\\left[ik_{z}(\\tau_{q , z}+t_{p , z})\\right]pc_{n}\\ket{k_{z}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that the partial translation @xmath258 associated with the inversion only provides an overall phase factor , and does not affect the commutation relation whereas @xmath259 does .",
    "therefore our theory can also be applied to systems with the inversion @xmath241 accompanying a partial translation , as long as the dirac point is located on the rotation axis .",
    "however , when the dirac point is located away from the rotation axis , the translation @xmath260 can cause nontrivial physical consequence as well .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath261 plane , perpendicular to the rotation axis , a bloch state @xmath262 satisfies , @xmath263pc_{n}\\ket{k_{x},k_{y}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath264pc_{n}\\ket{k_{x},k_{y}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath265 and we have used the relation @xmath266 .",
    "the point is that since @xmath267 due to the rotation , the partial translation @xmath260 associated with the inversion can also modify the commutation relation between the inversion and the rotation symmetries .",
    "because of this , even a symmorphic rotation symmetry , which is not accompanied by a translation , can create a dirac point away from the rotation axis when it is combined with the non - symmorphic inversion symmetry .    for illustration ,",
    "let us consider the commutation relation between @xmath268 and @xmath244 where @xmath269 .",
    "the bloch state @xmath262 satisfies , @xmath270pc_{2z}\\ket{k_{x},k_{y}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath271pc_{2z}\\ket{k_{x},k_{y}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence at the high symmetry momentum such as @xmath272 or @xmath273 where @xmath274 , we obtain @xmath275 . this anti - commutation relation can create a stable dirac point at @xmath276 and @xmath277 , which is again confirmed by @xmath7-theory analysis in the appendix [ sec : appendix2_3 ] . therefore ,",
    "although the symmorphic @xmath8 symmetry can not support a stable dirac point on the rotation axis , it can create a stable dirac point at the zone boundary in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis , when the @xmath8 is combined with a non - symmorphic inversion symmetry @xmath241 .",
    "in fact , as noted before , there are three symmetry generators , @xmath241 , @xmath229 , @xmath239 , at the @xmath201 point with @xmath237 in the diamond lattice . according to the previous discussion , the dirac point at @xmath201",
    "can be protected not only by @xmath241 and @xmath229 satisfying @xmath278 but also by @xmath241 and @xmath239 , which are also anti - commuting @xmath279 . because of the high crystalline symmetry , the dirac point in the diamond lattice is protected by multiple pairs of symmetry operators  @xcite .",
    "to sum up , we have studied the topological charge of 3d dirac semimetals protected by the time - reversal , the inversion , and the rotation symmetries .",
    "consideration of topological charges naturally leads to two different classes of dirac semimetals , which is consistent with the previous observation based on the symmetry constrained minimal hamiltonian analysis  @xcite .",
    "class i dirac semimetals are protected by an ordinary symmorphic rotation symmetry which commutes with the inversion .",
    "since each eigenstate carries a quantized rotation eigenvalue on the rotation axis , dirac points should form a pair having the opposite topological charges when the system is periodic along the rotation axis . on the other hand ,",
    "class ii dirac semimetals are associated with non - symmorphic screw rotation symmetries .",
    "the eigenvalue of a screw rotation is not quantized on the rotation axis due to the phase factor induced by a partial lattice translation , which enables to create a single isolated dirac point at the brillouin zone boundary .    the nonzero topological charge of a dirac point not only guarantees the stability of the gap - closing point , but can trigger new types of lifshitz transitions . for instance ,",
    "when two dirac points merge at the same momentum , the topological charge of the merging point is given by the summation of their topological charges .",
    "since the energy dispersion around the gap - closing point strongly depends on its topological charge , such a merging transition can generate intriguing nodal quasi - particles with novel physical properties  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of a quantized topological charge can be a source of new topological responses .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that the nonzero monopole charge of weyl points induces novel topological responses in weyl semimetals  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies of interesting topological responses in dirac semimetals  @xcite may imply nontrivial role of topological charges in these systems .    up to now ,",
    "two materials ( na@xmath0bi and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 ) belonging to the class i are discovered and extensively studied whereas class ii dirac semimetals are not uncovered yet .",
    "though there are some hypothetical candidate materials proposed theoretically  @xcite , all of them are chemically unstable because the metallic ion in each candidate compound is required to have a lone - pair valence electron to locate the fermi level at the dirac point  @xcite . in this respect , synthesizing class ii dirac semimetals is a challenging problem in material science which should be properly addressed in near future .",
    "we believe that class ii dirac semimetals are as important as class i dirac semimetals in the following sense . in the case of class",
    "i dirac semimetals , the dirac points are created by a band inversion , hence the intrinsic properties of 3d dirac particles can be observed only within the narrow energy scale associated with the band inversion  @xcite .",
    "because of this , if the competing energy scales , such as the fermi energy due to doped carriers or the disorder - induced broadening , are comparable to the band inversion energy , the intrinsic properties of 3d dirac particles can be easily washed out . however , in the case of class ii dirac semimetals , the energy scale of the dirac dispersion is simply given by the bandwidth of the system ( roughly in the order of a few ev ) , which obviously provides a better playground to study the intrinsic properties of 3d dirac particles .    secondly , we would like to draw attention to class ii dirac semimetals as potential novel topological states .",
    "the fact that the fu - kane - mele model is a canonical model to construct a 3d @xmath4 topological insulator implies the intrinsic topological nature of the associated dirac semimetal state . in particular , in the present paper",
    ", we have demonstrated that the presence of a single dirac point on the rotation axis is unnatural in consideration of the nielsen - ninomiya theorem , and , in fact , the projective nature of the screw rotation symmetry plays an essential role to circumvent the doubling of dirac points .",
    "although the discrete nature of the rotation symmetry should be distinct from the continuous u(1 ) symmetry associated with the original nielsen - ninomiya theorem , the mechanism leading to circumventing the fermion number doubling shares the common origin , i.e. , assigning a non - quantized quantum number to fermions . to reveal the topological properties of class ii dirac semimetals would definitely be an exciting theoretical problem which we leave for future studies .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that there are a class of dirac semimetals which are not completely treated in our classification scheme .",
    "let us note that , in both class i and ii dirac semimetals considered in the present work , dirac points are located on the rotation axis .",
    "however , rotation symmetries can also protect a dirac point which is away from the rotation axis .",
    "for instance , we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : diamond ] that the symmorphic @xmath8 rotation can protect a dirac point which is not on the rotation axis , when it is combined with a non - symmorphic inversion symmetry .",
    "moreover , the tight - binding model on a hcp lattice considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : hcp ] indicates that glide mirror symmetries can also give rise to symmetry - protected dirac points . to find a systematic way to classify these different types of dirac semimetals",
    "would also be an important problem for future research .",
