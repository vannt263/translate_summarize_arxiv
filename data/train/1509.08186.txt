    "today the painlev equations , both continuous and discrete , are well - established subjects in mathematics and mathematical physics @xcite . in the geometric approach to the painlev equations ,",
    "initiated by okamoto @xcite and subsequently extended by sakai @xcite to the discrete cases , the theory is controlled by the geometry of certain rational surfaces called the spaces of initial values .",
    "this framework gives a systematic description of the equations , symmetries , special solutions , lax pairs and so forth .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review on the current status of achievements in the geometric aspects of the painlev equations so as to serve it as a foundation of future researches in mathematics and mathematical physics .",
    "it also contains some materials which have been newly developed to complete a unified description .",
    "we put a particular emphasis on studying the discrete painlev equations of the second order .",
    "historically , the painlev differential equations were discovered by painlev and gambier @xcite in the efforts for finding new transcendental functions defined by `` good '' nonlinear ordinary differential equations .",
    "they imposed the condition that the solutions should admit only poles as movable singular points , which is now referred to as the _ painlev property_. then r. fuchs @xcite formulated them as the monodromy preserving deformations of linear ordinary differential equations , and subsequently schlesinger @xcite and garnier @xcite investigated their generalizations .",
    "almost sixty years later , the painlev equations were found to describe the correlation function of the ising model by wu - mccoy - tracy - barouch @xcite .",
    "inspired by this discovery , the theory of holonomic quantum field theory @xcite and a general theory of the monodromy preserving deformation of linear ordinary differential equations was established by sato s group in kyoto @xcite .",
    "the study of geometric aspects of the painlev equations , which is a main topic of this paper , has been initiated by okamoto s pioneering work @xcite . for each painlev equation",
    ", he constructed the _ space of initial values _ which parametrizes all the solutions .",
    "takano further found that the painlev equations themselves can be reproduced uniquely from the space of initial values @xcite .",
    "these works are the basis of sakai s approach for discrete painlev equations which will be mentioned below .",
    "on the other hand , discrete integrable systems , started in 70 s by the pioneering works of ablowitz - ladik and hirota , have been regarded as equally or more important as the continuous integrable systems .",
    "the discrete painlev equations also appear in @xcite , and attracted attention by the discoveries of the scaling limit to the painlev differential equations in the context of two - dimensional quantum gravity @xcite . in accordance with these studies , grammaticos , ramani and papageorgiou",
    "introduced the concept of _ singularity confinement _ as a discrete counterpart of the painlev property and proposed to use it as an integrability detector for discrete systems @xcite .",
    "then ramani , grammaticos and hietarinta applied this idea to obtain non - autonomous version of the two - dimensional integrable mappings known as the quispel - roberts - thompson ( qrt ) mappings @xcite and succeeded in constructing discrete painlev equations systematically @xcite .",
    "subsequently , discrete painlev equations as well as their generalizations have been studied from various points of view , such as bcklund transformations , lax pairs , particular solutions , @xmath1 functions and so on . for a review of those developments ,",
    "we refer to @xcite . in the meanwhile ,",
    "underlying mathematical structures have gradually been clarified .",
    "jimbo and sakai constructed a @xmath2-difference analogue of painlev vi equation in the spirit of deformation theory of linear @xmath2-difference equation @xcite .",
    "a universal symmetry structure behind the continuous and discrete painlev equations has been revealed in terms of the birational representations of affine weyl groups which is also applicable to higher dimensional painlev type equations @xcite .    in the efforts for finding a unified framework for the painlev type equations",
    ", sakai proposed a class of second order discrete painlev equations arising from cremona transformations of rational surfaces obtained as nine - point blow - ups of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "those rational surfaces are regarded as the spaces of initial values for discrete and continuous painlev equations , and are classified into 22 cases according to the configuration of nine points .",
    "the master equation of those painlev equations , the _",
    "elliptic painlev equation _",
    ", is obtained from the most generic configuration ; it provides with the geometric construction of discrete painlev equation with affine weyl group symmetry of type @xmath4 as proposed by ohta , ramani and grammaticos @xcite .",
    "other equations are obtained from the degenerate configurations .    on the basis of this geometric approach",
    ", above - mentioned various aspects of the painlev equations can be investigated in a unified manner in the language of picard lattice and root systems .",
    "for example , the hypergeometric seed solutions to all possible discrete painlev equations have been constructed in @xcite .",
    "lax pairs for discrete painlev equations have been constructed through their characterization in terms of the point configuration @xcite .",
    "geometric approach is effective particularly in the study of painlev equations with high symmetry such as @xmath5 type .",
    "the plan of this review is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give an overview of various aspects of the painlev equations to be discussed in this review .",
    "taking the examples of the painlev iv equation ( p@xmath6 ) and a discrete painlev ii equation ( dp@xmath7 ) which arises as a bcklund transformation of p@xmath6 , we introduce basic objects in the theory of painlev equations , such as affine weyl group symmetry , lax pairs , hypergeometric solutions , @xmath1 functions and the space of initial values in the sense of okamoto and sakai .",
    "the space of initial values is , roughly speaking , a surface on which the solutions of the painlev equation in question are parametrized . for each painlev equation , this surface is characterized by a pair of affine root systems which represent the symmetry type and the surface type .",
    "many properties of painlev equations as presented in section 2 are systematically controlled by geometry of the surface . in section 3",
    ", we provide with general frameworks of the root systems , weyl groups and the picard lattice relevant to the painlev equations .",
    "these devices will be utilized throughout subsequent sections as fundamental and powerful tools for studying the painlev equations .",
    "one of the common properties of the painlev equations is that the space of initial values is obtained from @xmath0 , the product of two copies of the riemann sphere , by blowing up at eight points .",
    "therefore the configuration of the eight points , which possibly includes infinitely near points , provides with the most fundamental data of the equation . with the items obtained in section 3 in hand ,",
    "we demonstrate how to associate a point configuration on @xmath0 to a given discrete equation in section 4 .",
    "this provides us a practical method for determining whether it is a discrete painlev equation in sakai s class , and if so , identifying the type of the equation by its surface type and symmetry type .",
    "if the configuration of eight points in @xmath0 is generic , the corresponding space of initial values has the largest symmetry of type @xmath4 .",
    "other configurations can be regarded as the degenerate cases , among all possible 22 configurations classified by sakai . in section 5 , we describe how to construct the equations and relevant characteristic features from the point configuration . in particular , we formulate a representation of affine weyl group of type @xmath4 from the configuration of generic eight points in @xmath0 , as well as the formalism of @xmath1 functions .",
    "we then derive a new explicit form of the three equations of type @xmath4 , which are the elliptic , @xmath2- and difference painlev equations , from a translation of the root lattice .",
    "we also give an example demonstrating how to construct the birational representation of the affine weyl group for a given degenerate point configuration .",
    "most of the painlev equations admit a class of particular solutions expressible in terms of the special functions of hypergeometric type for special values of parameters which correspond to reflection hyperplanes in the parameter space . in section 6 ,",
    "we demonstrate how to construct the hypergeometric solutions by decoupling a given equation to the riccati equation and by linearizing it .",
    "then we give an intrinsic formulation of this procedure by the geometric language of point configurations .",
    "the list of hypergeometric solutions associated with possible point configurations will be given in section 8 .",
    "it is a common feature of nonlinear integrable systems that they arise as the compatibility condition of certain systems of linear equations which is called a lax pair . in section 7",
    "we give a geometric formulation of the lax pairs for painlev equations in terms of associated point configurations .",
    "section 8 is a comprehensive collection of data for all painlev equations which can be obtained by various methods discussed in this review . for each case",
    ", we provide with explicit forms of equations , point configurations / root data , weyl group representations , lax pairs and hypergeometric seed solutions .    in this review , we present a general geometric framework as well as algebraic tools for studying the painlev equations , confining ourselves to the second order equations . even in the second order equations ,",
    "there are various discrete painlev equations which are not directly investigated in this paper , e.g. , equations arising from the translations with different directions or length in the root lattice @xcite .",
    "also , we do not deal with higher order or multi - variable generalizations , which are now actively studied in relation with soliton equations @xcite , geometry of space of initial values @xcite , geometry of flag varieties @xcite , or general theory of monodromy preserving deformations @xcite .",
    "the painlev equations are believed to define new transcendental functions , and it was rigorously proved for the painlev differential equations ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "similar investigations for discrete painlev equations have been done in @xcite .",
    "asymptotic analysis for the solutions of painlev equations are also an important subject in view of applications @xcite .",
    "recently , applications to various areas of physics and mathematical sciences , including probability theory and combinatorics , have been actively studied based on the random matrix theory @xcite",
    ". there are also other interesting relationships to various areas , such as discrete differential geometry , integrable models of quantum physics and lattice models , ultradiscrete systems , quivers and cluster algebras .",
    "we hope that the materials provided in this review will be utilized for further developments of the theory of painlev equations and related areas .",
    "this section is an overview of various aspects of the painlev equations to be discussed in this review . taking the examples of p@xmath6 and dp@xmath7",
    ", we introduce basic objects in the theory of painlev equations , such as affine weyl group symmetry , lax pairs , hypergeometric solutions , @xmath1 functions and the space of initial values .",

    "we call this convention the _ symbolical composition _ , since it is convenient for symbolic computations .",
    "the other way is to regard the bcklund transformations as the transformations of five variables @xmath44 .",
    "we define @xmath45 and @xmath46 , for instance , by @xmath47 in this convention , the composition of @xmath48 , for example , is calculated as follows .",

    "this is a general phenomena as is shown schematically @xmath55 in order to see the difference of two conventions , the following simple example may be useful .",
