    "+ in general , however , in the above cases many more , i.e. of the order of 1000 diagrams contribute and naturally it is necessary to investigate diagrams with various non - zero masses .",

    "such a more general program , called * diana * ( for diagram analyser ) @xcite , written in c and making use of nogueira s qgraf @xcite , was also developed in our group .",
    "it produces form @xcite input for the feynman diagrams according to the feynman rules for further evaluation .",
    "in the following we shortly review the main techniques we applied , namely the taylor expansion ( te ) @xcite and the lme @xcite . the efficiency of both approaches will be compared .",
    "taylor series expansions in terms of one external momentum squared , @xmath0 say , were considered in @xcite , pad approximants were introduced in @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that this approach can be used to calculate feynman diagrams on their cut by analytic continuation . in the case of a three - point function like @xmath16 we have two independent external momenta in @xmath26 dimensions .",
    "the general expansion of ( any loop ) scalar 3-point function with its momentum space representation @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where the coefficients @xmath29 are to be determined from the given diagram . considering @xmath16 with @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath30 , which is a good approximation , only the coefficients @xmath31 are needed .",
    "for the calculation of the taylor coefficients in general various procedures have been proposed @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "these methods are well suited for programming in terms of a formulae manipulating language like form . such programs , however , yield acceptable analytic results only in cases when not too many parameters ( like masses ) enter the problem .",
    "otherwise numerical methods are needed @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in the case of only one non - zero mass and only one external momentum squared , indeed the case with the least nontrivial parameters , for many diagrams analytic expressions for the taylor coefficients can be obtained . in sect .",
    "5 we present some recent results .    for the purpose of calculating feynman diagrams in the kinematical domain of interest",
    "it is necessary to calculate them from the taylor series on their cut .",
    "this is performed by analytic continuation in terms of a mapping .",
    "assume , the following taylor expansion of a scalar diagram or a particular amplitude is given @xmath32 and the function on the r.h.s .",
    "has a cut for @xmath33 .",
    "the method of evaluation of the original series consists in a first step in a conformal mapping of the cut plane into the unit circle and secondly the reexpansion of the function under consideration into a power series w.r.t .",
    "the new conformal variable .",
    "a variable often used is @xmath34    by this conformal transformation , the @xmath35-plane , cut from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , is mapped into the unit circle ( see fig.[conf ] ) and the cut itself is mapped on its boundary , the upper semicircle corresponding to the upper side of the cut .",
    "the origin goes into the point @xmath38 .",
    "+ after conformal transformation it is suggestive to improve the convergence of the new series w.r.t .",
    "@xmath39 by applying the pad method @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a convenient technique for the evaluation of pad approximations is the @xmath40-algorithm of  @xcite which allows one to evaluate the pad approximants recursively .      in particular for the evaluation of diagrams with several different masses , one of which being large ( like the top mass , e.g. , @xmath41 ) , we use the general method of asymptotic expansion in large masses @xcite .",
    "for a given scalar graph @xmath42 the expansion in large mass is given by the formula @xmath43 where @xmath24 s are subgraphs involved in the lme , @xmath44 denotes shrinking of @xmath24 to a point ; @xmath45 is the feynman integral corresponding to @xmath24 ; @xmath46 is the taylor operator expanding the integrand in small masses @xmath47 and external momenta @xmath48 of the subgraph @xmath24 ; @xmath49 stands for the convolution of the subgraph expansion with the integrand @xmath50 .",
    "the sum goes over all subgraphs @xmath24 which ( a ) contain all lines with large masses , and ( b ) are one - particle irreducible w.r.t .",
    "light lines .    for the @xmath16 decay we have @xmath51 for the on - shell z s .",
    "fig.4 shows diagrams with two different masses on virtual lines , one of which is a top .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath14 are the gauge bosons with masses @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively ; @xmath55 is the charged would - be goldstone boson ( we use the feynman gauge ) ; @xmath56 and @xmath12 are the t- and b - quarks .",
    "+ applying the method of the lme , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are considered as small . in the framework of this expansion contributions from additional subgraphs",
    "are to be taken into account together with the taylor expansion of the initial diagrams w.r.t . external momenta and light masses .",
    "these are shown in fig.5 .",
    "bold , thin and dashed lines correspond to heavy - mass , light - mass , and massless propagators , respectively .",
    "dotted lines indicate the lines omitted in the original graph @xmath57 to yield the subgraph @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath58 ( see ( [ lama ] ) ) then consists out of all the dotted lines after schrinking @xmath24 to a point .    these subgraphs restore the analytic properties of the initial diagrams ( like logarithmic behaviour ) .",
    "in other words , the taylor expansion of the initial diagrams produces extra infrared singularities which are compensated by singularities of the additional subgraphs so that only the singularities of the original diagrams survive .    at this point",
    "it also becomes clear what the difference is between the small-@xmath0 expansion and what is called here the lme : in the former case we assume all masses large , i.e. @xmath59 while in the latter case only @xmath41 is considered as large and all other parameters small , i.e. @xmath60 . in this sense",
    "both methods are lm expansions . the technical advantage of the second method is , however , that only bubbles with one mass occur , which can be expressed in terms of @xmath57 functions , while in the case of the small @xmath0 expansion bubbles with different masses are involved , which are much more difficult to evaluate , in fact only numerically .",
    "of course also the number and structure of the subgraphs is different in the two cases .",
    "+    finally the lme of the above diagrams has the following general form :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the highest degree of divergence ( ultraviolet , infrared , collinear ) in the various contributions to the lme ( @xmath63 3 in the cases considered ) . @xmath64 and @xmath65 are considered as small parameters .",
    "@xmath66 are in general complicated functions of the arguments , i.e. they may contain logarithms and higher polylogarithms .    in the next section we present results and compare the two methods described here .",
    "the small momentum expansion of cases 7 , 7.1 and 7.2 is described in detail in ref .",
    "the additional subgraph arising in these cases is the same irrespectively of the mass distribution and is shown in fig.5 ( @xmath67 7 ) .    in the case of the lme two additional subgraphs",
    "arise in each of the cases 7.1 and 7.2 . beyond that",
    "these sets of additional subgraphs are also of quite different structure",
    ". furthermore the @xmath68 and @xmath69 graphs in the row ( see fig.5 ) produce @xmath70 terms which cancel , however . since there are no uv divergences , these must be mixtures of infrared and collinear ones .",
    "they determine the highest degree of divergence in these cases and thus the highest power of the logarithm as discussed in ( 4 ) .",
    "our numerical results for cases 7.1 and 7.2 are presented in fig.6 , and for @xmath7 in table 1 . in the figures we show the small @xmath0-expansion ( solid line ) in comparison with the lowest order approximation ( middle - dashed ) and the sum of terms ( small - dashed ) with @xmath71=9 , see ( 4 ) .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath72 , i.e. only @xmath73=0 contributes in ( 4 ) .",
    "we see that up to @xmath7 the sum of 11 terms agrees quite well with the small @xmath0-expansion , while for higher @xmath0 the agreement very quickly worsens . for this reason we formally apply also the pad summation technique . with 11 terms in the series , a [ 5/5]-approximant ( long - dashed ) can be constructed .",
    "it is seen that indeed this improves the situation considerably up to @xmath74 though for a better agreement many more terms in the lme would be needed . in the small @xmath0-expansion",
    "only 9 terms were taken into account , i.e. a [ 4/4 ] approximant is calculated . from table 1 we see that for @xmath7 indeed a rather precise result can be obtained with 11 terms from the lme , in particular if pad s are applied @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 in table 1 corresponds to the lowest order of the diagrams ( n=-1 or 0 , respectively ) and @xmath76 to the order of expansion performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".values of diagrams at @xmath77 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ lme1 ]",
    "of particular interest is the calculation of bremsstrahlung in terms of the lme .",
    "let us consider again the decay @xmath16 . the kinematics of the ( gluon- ) bremsstrahlung for this process is given by    @xmath78 thus we have 3 invariants @xmath79    we are interested in the integrated bremsstrahlung .",
    "the phase space measure in @xmath80 dimensions can be written as @xmath81 and the invariants can be expressed in terms of @xmath82 as @xmath83    for the 1-loop amplitude we apply the lme w.r.t the top mass @xmath84 . for the diagrams with @xmath53 and @xmath41 mass in virtual lines the desired expansion looks like @xmath85 where @xmath86 are cubic polynoms of @xmath87 with coefficients being functions of @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89    after expansion",
    "the integration over the phase space is trivial ( it can be done completely in terms of @xmath57-functions ) .",
    "so far the method of expansion is considered as semianalytic in the sence that only a limited number of coefficients can be obtained explicitely . in this section , however , we want to go one step further .",
    "we calculate the first few coefficients of the expansion of a diagram with only one non - zero mass by means of the lme @xcite method .",
    "the method of differential equations @xcite then yields an idea , like in @xcite , what the general analytic form of these coefficients might be , providing some `` basis '' in terms of which they might be expressed .",
    "the ansatz of equating the explicit coefficients obtained from the lme to a linear combination in terms of the basis elements , yields a system of linear equations , which can be solved to yield the desired representation of the coefficients .",
    "the main problem in this approach is the choice of the basis elements .",
    "we start from so - called harmonic sums which are particularly relevant for moments of structure functions in qcd ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these functions are directly related to ( generalized ) polylogarithms @xcite and therefore it is not surprising that they appear in the analysis of massive diagrams .",
    "however , not every massive diagram even of self - energy type can be expressed in terms of these sums .",
    "apart from harmonic sums we introduce a new type of sums which we call @xmath52- and @xmath90-sums .",
    "our starting point is the lme @xcite of the diagrams . for the particular diagrams under consideration it was discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "here we just note that the result of a large mass expansion for these diagrams reads ( @xmath91 ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the dimensionality of the diagram , @xmath39 and @xmath94 independent of @xmath95 are the highest degree of divergence and the highest power of @xmath96 , respectively ( in our cases @xmath97 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath98 are of the form @xmath99 with @xmath100 being rational numbers and @xmath101 is the riemann @xmath102-function .    series ( [ lme ] ) always has a nonzero radius of convergence , which is defined by the position of the nearest nonzero threshold in the @xmath0-channel . for brevity we shall call @xmath62-cuts ( @xmath103-cuts , etc . ) possible cuts of a diagram in @xmath0 corresponding to 1 ( 2 , etc . ) massive particles in the intermediate state .",
    "we start from diagrams with the simplest threshold structure , i.e. with @xmath62-cuts and @xmath104-cuts .",
    "it turns out that all of these with only one massive line are expressible in terms of harmonic sums @xmath105 and alternating harmonic sums @xmath106 .    as a first example consider the 2-loop 2-point function of fig .",
    "7 , @xmath107 , which was considered in @xcite . using the standard large mass expansion technique one",
    "can get the first few coefficients of the expansion of this diagram in powers of @xmath91 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the riemann @xmath102-function .",
    "our first step is to find an expression for the higher order terms of the series ( [ sample1 ] ) as a functions of @xmath95 i.e. @xmath110 .    to achieve this",
    "let us search for @xmath111 as a linear combination of harmonic sums .",
    "the rule is that one has to take into account all possible products of the type @xmath112 with the transcendentality level ( tl ) @xmath113 .",
    "it is obvious that one can exclude @xmath114 from the very beginning since it never appears on the r.h.s . of ( [ sample1 ] ) .",
    "thus we have the following ansatz for @xmath111 @xmath115 where @xmath116 are rational numbers independent on @xmath95 .",
    "the argument of the @xmath117-functions is @xmath118 .",
    "we refer to the structures in ( [ ansatz ] ) as ` basis elements ' . indeed , the functions @xmath119 are algebraically independent .    inserting the expression for @xmath111 from ( [ ansatz ] ) into the l.h.s . of ( [ sample1 ] ) and equating equal powers of @xmath120",
    ", we obtain a system of linear equations for the @xmath121 .",
    "an explicit computation ensures that the system can be solved in terms of rational numbers for the @xmath121 the solution is @xmath122 i.e. the answer for the diagram at hand is @xmath123    equation ( [ ansatz ] ) can be considered as expansion of the general coefficient @xmath111 in terms of a ` basis' with ( unknown , rational ) coefficients @xmath121 .",
    "now the question arises : what are the basis elements in general ?",
    "so far we are lacking rules for predicting a basis of a given diagram .",
    "the power of the method , however , is that given a set of basis elements for one diagram , it can be used to find the solution for other diagrams .",
    "often , though , one has to ` generalize ' already known ( harmonic ) sums in a basis .    as an illustration consider the diagram shown in fig .  7 , @xmath124",
    ". its large mass expansion looks like @xmath125 with the @xmath126 s being rational numbers .",
    "it is obvious that one can search for a solution for each of the @xmath126 s independently .",
    "again we use the same set of functions ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) as above but now with different transcendentality level(s ) .",
    "the system of equations has a solution only if we add the factor @xmath129 which can be seen easily by inspection of the series . at the end",
    "we arrive at @xmath130 where as above we take all harmonic sums ( @xmath131 ) with the argument @xmath118 , which is omitted .",
    "we point out that in ( [ res2 ] ) the part without @xmath132 has basis elements @xmath133 obeying @xmath134 ( i.e. it has a basis with tl@xmath135 ) .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath132 are of 3rd level while those proportional to @xmath136 of the 2nd .",
    "one can say that @xmath132 itself is of 1st level and each @xmath137 reduces the level of basis elements by @xmath93 units .",
    "this is the general behaviour for all diagrams we consider .",
    "the same rule applies to uv and ir poles @xmath138 if they are present in a diagram i.e. each @xmath139 reduces the level of basis elements by @xmath93 units .",
    "we also stress the presence of the factor @xmath129 . strictly speaking the basis",
    "now is not @xmath133 but rather @xmath140 .",
    "finally we observe the following recipe of generalization , i.e .",
    "elements of higher tl ( @xmath141 ) can be constructed in the form :    @xmath142    the structure of the lowest level for diagrams having both @xmath62- and @xmath103-cuts is more complicated .",
    "we find it from the nonplanar graph shown in fig .  7 , @xmath143 .",
    "namely this diagram has a double collinear pole and we can easily perform the integrations in calculating the @xmath144 contribution with the result    @xmath145    if we assign to the factor @xmath146 the 0th level , then the expression on the r.h.s of ( [ polepart ] ) has the correct 2nd level as it should be for the double pole part of a vertex function .",
    "the generalization is done according to    @xmath147    the result for the diagram under consideration finally is    @xmath148   \\nonumber\\\\   & &        - 18 \\zeta_2 w_1        - 4 w_3        - 8 s_3        + 12 w_{1,2 }        - 8 w_{2,1 }        - 12 w_{1,(1 + 1 ) }   \\nonumber\\\\   & &        - 16 s_{1,2 }        - 8 s_1 w_2        - 24 s_1 w_{1,1 }        - 16 s_1 s_2        - 12 s_1 ^ 2 w_1        \\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath149    all have tl@xmath150 .    for completeness",
    "we mention a further type of basis elements which we discovered from the application of the differential equation method @xcite    @xmath151    further basis elements were obtained in a similar fashion .",
    "the result for a great variety of diagrams will be published elsewhere .",
    "the purpose of many of our investigations is to test various methods for the calculation of two - loop diagrams needed for the evaluation of measured processes in the full sm of the electroweak theory .",
    "comparing different methods yields information about their precision and possible applicability .",
    "in particular we have forced the developement of packages for the large mass expansion and found that in the domain of interest for the processes under consideration this method can be used with reasonable liability . for the case of only one non - zero mass a completely new approach",
    "was found , namely `` guess and verify '' , to set up analytic expressions for many diagrams of interest .",
