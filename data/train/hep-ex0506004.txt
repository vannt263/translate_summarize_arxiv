    "inclusive lepton scattering off the deuteron has provided a wealth of information about internal nucleon structure and nuclear phenomena . since a free neutron target does not exist , the deuteron is the simplest target for the study of neutron structure functions .",
    "the weak coupling between the two nucleons in the deuteron , corresponding to a large space - time separation , suggests that the nucleus can be described as a non - relativistic proton and neutron moving inside some mean potential . to this end",
    ", the momentum distribution of the deuteron was established with high precision from the quasi - elastic and @xmath7 reactions , and approaches describing the fermi motion of the nucleons were developed .",
    "this naive picture , however , was superseded by experiments when the european muon collaboration ( emc ) discovered deviations of the measured nuclear structure function @xmath0 from that of a free proton and neutron convoluted with fermi smearing ( a phenomenon known as the emc - effect  @xcite ) .",
    "different attempts to explain the emc - effect have been undertaken , but without reaching a unified and , therefore , definitive description .",
    "a quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)-based approach , on the other hand , can handle the nuclear structure functions in a model - independent manner . this method is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the structure function moments , whose @xmath2-evolution is known in qcd at leading twist and some fixed order in @xmath8 .",
    "note that qcd predictions on the @xmath2-evolution are target - independent and nuclear effects are only to modify the normalization of moments , known in few cases from lattice qcd simulations .",
    "however , the leading twist picture is valid only in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and for not very large @xmath6 values . beyond these kinematic boundaries , e.g. in the region of large @xmath6 and moderate",
    "@xmath2 , new poorly established physics appears .",
    "this kinematic domain has a particular interest because multi - parton correlation phenomena manifest themselves as deviations from perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions . for a nuclear target some part of these deviations",
    "will be related to the nucleon interaction with its environment . in the one photon exchange approximation , the cross section for inclusive electron scattering off a nucleus",
    "is described by the total absorption of the virtual photon by the nucleus .",
    "the optical theorem relates the total virtual photoabsorption cross section to the forward compton scattering amplitude of the virtual photon on the nucleus . the latter amplitude , in general ,",
    "can be represented as a product of two hadronic currents separated by a certain space - time interval @xmath9 . in the bjorken limit ,",
    "the interval @xmath10 ( while the light - cone @xmath11 component is fixed ) allows one to apply the ope to the product of non - local hadronic currents .",
    "this leads to a relation where the moments @xmath12 ( cornwall - norton definition  @xcite ) of the nucleon ( nucleus with mass @xmath13 ) structure functions , defined as : @xmath14 are expanded as a series of inverse powers ( twists ) of the four - momentum transfer @xmath2 ( for details see ref .",
    "a study of the @xmath2 dependence of these moments , therefore , would permit one to isolate different terms of this series , each representing distinct physical processes in qcd .",
    "the first term in the expansion represents the leading twist , i.e. the limit of asymptotic freedom , while higher terms account for the interactions among partons inside the nucleon .",
    "the contribution of these multi - parton correlations to the nucleon wave function increases in the region of large @xmath6 ( corresponding to high moment order @xmath15 ) and low @xmath2 .    for the proton , a careful study of the multi - parton correlation contribution , which included",
    "a global analysis of all the world s data on the proton structure function @xmath0 , has been recently described in ref .",
    "this analysis could not be done for the deuteron structure function because of the lack of data in the region of the quasi - elastic peak , and because of the scarcity of data in the resonance region . however , a previous analysis from ref .",
    "@xcite , based on fits of the structure function @xmath0 , showed a modification of the scaling behaviour of the nucleon structure function @xmath0 in the nuclear medium .",
    "the hall  c collaboration at jefferson lab has recently provided high quality data in this kinematic region  @xcite , but the exclusion of the quasi - elastic peak in this measurement prevented further studies of these data in terms of qcd .",
    "experimental data on the deuteron structure function @xmath16 used for the moment evaluation in the clas kinematic region .",
    "the points show world data from refs .",
    "the shaded area shows clas data . ]    in this paper we report on a measurement of unpolarized inclusive electron scattering from deuterium taken with the clas detector in hall b at jefferson lab .",
    "the data span a wide continuous two - dimensional region in @xmath6 and @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xandq2domain ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 structure function of the deuteron was extracted over the entire resonance region ( @xmath17  gev ) below @xmath18  ( gev / c)@xmath5 .",
    "this measurement , together with existing world data , allowed for the first time the evaluation of the first four @xmath0 moments of the deuteron down to @xmath19 ( gev / c)@xmath5 .    in section  [ sec : moments ] we review the @xmath0 moments in the framework of pqcd . in section  [ sec : dataanalysis ] we discuss improvements in the data analysis implemented since the first unpolarized inclusive measurement at clas , along with some details of the evaluation of the moments . for other details of the analysis",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the interpretation of the results .",
    "measured structure functions for a free nucleon target in the dis regime are related to parton momentum distributions of the nucleon . for a nuclear target",
    "this relation is not direct since it is necessary to account for effects of the fermi motion , meson exchange currents , off - shellness of the nucleon and final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "nevertheless , the ope of the structure function moments of the nuclear structure function is still applicable in the same way as for the free nucleon .",
    "the @xmath15-th cornwall - norton moment  @xcite of the ( asymptotic ) structure function @xmath16 for a massless target can be expanded as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the factorization ( renormalization ) scale@xmath24 , @xmath25 is an arbitrary reference scale , @xmath26 is the reduced matrix element of the local operators with definite spin @xmath15 and twist @xmath27 ( dimension minus spin ) which is related to the non - perturbative structure of the target .",
    "@xmath28 is a dimensionless coefficient function describing the small distance behaviour , which can be perturbatively expressed as a power expansion of the running coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the leading twist ( @xmath30 ) @xmath2 dependence remains unchanged with respect to the free nucleon target and all the nuclear effects appear either in the higher twist terms ( @xmath31 ) or in the reduced matrix element @xmath32 , which does not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "the non - zero mass of the target@xmath5 leads to additional @xmath33 power corrections ( kinematic twists ) which mix operators of different spin .",
    "these target mass corrections can be accounted for by use of nachtmann  @xcite moments @xmath34 instead of the usual ( massless ) cornwall - norton moments . in the bjorken limit",
    "@xmath33 terms become negligible and both definitions coincide .",
    "the nachtmann moments for the deuteron structure function are defined as follows : @xmath35 , \\label{eq : i_nm1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the proton mass and @xmath38 .",
    "the evolution of the leading twist term is known for the first four moments up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . however",
    ", if one wants to extend the analysis down to @xmath39 and to large @xmath6 , where the rest of the perturbative series becomes significant , one needs to account for additional logarithmic corrections due to soft gluon radiation  @xcite .",
    "these corrections re - summed in the moment space to all orders of @xmath8 appear due to an imbalance of the virtual and real gluon emission at @xmath40 . since the @xmath2-evolution of the higher twist terms , related to quark - quark and quark - gluon correlations , is unknown , their logarithmic qcd behaviour is parameterized and the corresponding anomalous dimensions are extracted from the data .",
    "measurement of the nachtmann moments @xmath34 in the intermediate @xmath2 range ( @xmath41  ( gev / c)@xmath5 ) allows a model - independent separation of the total higher twist contribution from the leading twist .",
    "comparison of the higher twist contribution in the deuteron to that in the free proton provides important insight into the nucleon structure modifications inside nuclear matter .",
    "the data were collected at jefferson lab in hall b with the clas using a liquid - deuterium target with thickness @xmath42  g / cm@xmath5 during the electron beam running periods in march - april 2000 and january - march 2002 .",
    "the average beam - target luminosity for these periods was 6@xmath4410@xmath45 @xmath46s@xmath47 . to maximize the interval in @xmath2 and @xmath6 ,",
    "data were taken at two different electron beam energies : @xmath48  2.474 and 5.770 gev .",
    "the accumulated statistics at the two energies is large enough ( @xmath49 triggers ) to allow for the extraction of the inclusive cross section with a small statistical uncertainty ( @xmath50 5% ) in small @xmath6 and @xmath2 bins ( @xmath510.009 , @xmath520.05 ( gev / c)@xmath5 ) .",
    "the clas is a magnetic spectrometer  @xcite based on a six - coil torus magnet whose field is primarily oriented along the azimuthal direction .",
    "the sectors , located between the magnet coils , are individually instrumented to form six independent magnetic spectrometers .",
    "the particle detection system includes drift chambers ( dc ) for track reconstruction  @xcite , scintillation counters ( sc ) for time of flight measurements  @xcite , cherenkov counters ( cc ) for electron identification  @xcite , and electromagnetic calorimeters ( ec ) to measure neutrals and to improve electron - pion separation  @xcite .",
    "the ec detectors , which have a granularity defined by triangular cells in a plane perpendicular to the incoming particles , are used to study the shape of the electromagnetic shower and are longitudinally divided into two parts with the inner part acting as a pre - shower . charged particles can be detected and identified for momenta down to 0.2 ( gev / c ) and for polar angles between 8@xmath53 and 142@xmath53 .",
    "the clas superconducting coils limit the acceptance for charged hadrons from about 80% at @xmath54 to about 50% at forward angles ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the total angular acceptance for electrons is about 1.5 sr .",
    "electron momentum resolution is a function of the scattered electron angle and varies from 0.5% for @xmath56 up to 1 - 2% for @xmath57 .",
    "the angular resolution is approximately constant , approaching 1  mrad for polar and 4  mrad for azimuthal angles : the resolution for the momentum transfer ranges therefore from 0.2 up to 0.5 % .",
    "the scattered electron missing mass ( @xmath58 ) resolution was estimated to be 2.5 mev for a beam energy less than 3 gev and about 7 mev for larger energies . to study all possible multi - particle states ,",
    "the acquisition trigger was configured to require at least one electron candidate in any of the sectors , where an electron candidate was defined as the coincidence of a signal in the ec and cherenkov modules for any one of the sectors .",
    "the data analysis procedure has been described in detail in refs .",
    "therefore , in this article we focus on changes and improvements in the analysis .",
    "the most important improvements , leading to a significant reduction of the estimated systematic uncertainties relative to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , are described in the following sections .      the pion contamination observed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the electron candidate sample was found to be due to random coincidences between a pion track measured in the dc and a noise pulse in a cc photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) ( typically corresponding to one photo - electron ) .",
    "these coincidences can be greatly reduced by means of better matching between the cc hits and the measured tracks .",
    "each clas sector consists of 18 cc segments , each containing two pmts .",
    "therefore , the probability of a coincidence is the product of probabilities to have a noise signal in one of 36 pmts together with a negative pion track in a time interval , @xmath59150 ns , which corresponds to the trigger window time .",
    "the average cc pmt noise rate @xmath60 in clas was measured to be @xmath6142 khz . for our typical running conditions , the average rate of negatively charged hadrons within our geometrical ec fiducial cuts ( used to ensure the shower is fully contained with the detector ) that have an appropriate ec signal is of the order of @xmath622.3 khz .",
    "this gives an estimate of the possible contamination : @xmath63 which should be compared to the electron rate @xmath64250 hz , using the same cuts .",
    "therefore , the expected contamination is of the order of 6% overall .",
    "in contrast , for small momenta @xmath65 ( gev / c ) and large scattering angles , @xmath66 , @xmath621.7 khz and @xmath64100 hz , resulting in a contamination of 12% .    in order to reduce the contamination of the coincidences between a hadron track and a cc noise signal , we applied geometrical and time matching requirements between the cc signal and the measured track in the following way :    1 .",
    "we defined a cc projective plane , an imaginary plane behind the cc detector where cherenkov radiation would arrive if it were to propagate the same distance from the emission point to the pmt without any reflections in the mirror system ; 2 .",
    "for each cc segment we found the polar angle from the clas center to the image of the cc segment center and to the images of the cc edges ; 3 .",
    "the impact point and the direction of the track in the sc plane , as measured in the dc , were used to obtain the measured polar angle @xmath67 in the projective plane for each electron candidate event .",
    "we fitted the @xmath67 distributions separately for each cc segment in order to extract their measured width @xmath68 ; 4 .   for each cc segment",
    "we applied a cut : @xmath69 which was intended to remove those electron event candidates for which the track impact point in the cc was far away from the segment where the hit was detected . in fig .",
    "[ fig : thp_cut ] an example of the @xmath67 distribution is shown for one segment and the cut applied is indicated by dashed lines . to clearly identify the contribution of the coincidences and check the efficiency of the cut we separated events outside the single photo - electron peak ( which contains most of the pion contamination ) by applying a cut , @xmath70 .",
    "these electron candidate events with reduced pion contamination are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thp_cut ] by the hatched histogram .",
    "the difference between the empty and the hatched histogram in the figure is therefore mostly due to the pion contamination ; 5 .   to perform time matching between the cc and sc hits of the electron candidate event we studied the distribution of the time - offset of the cc signal with respect to the sc . for each cc segment we measured @xmath71 , defined as follows : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are hit times , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the path lengths from the clas center to the hit points in the sc and cc , and @xmath77 is the track velocity measured in the sc .",
    "the distribution of sc - cc time - offsets is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dt_cut ] . the electron - rich events outside the single photo - electron peak",
    "are emphasized by the hatched histogram , and the cut applied is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the presence of the double peak near @xmath78 is expected due to a small time offset between the two pmts within the cc segment ; 6 .",
    "the measured photo - electron distribution for the electron candidate events was compared to the one obtained after all the cuts described above had been applied .",
    "this comparison is shown by different histograms in fig .  [",
    "fig : after_cut ] .    after applying the matching procedure ,",
    "the pion contamination was reduced from 30% to 5% in the worst case .",
    "the remaining contamination is due to events where the pion impact point in the cc is very close to the pmt with the noise signal .",
    "this contribution was removed by the same procedure as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to estimate the systematic uncertainties of this correction we compared the method to another approach , namely , requiring more than 2.5 photo - electrons in the cc and estimating the number of missing electrons by an extrapolation , using the empirical function from ref .",
    "@xcite adjusted for each particular run period .",
    "the difference between the two methods provides an estimate of the systematic uncertainties in the pion rejection corrections .",
    "the total relative systematic uncertainty of this correction is kinematic dependent ; at larger @xmath2 the contribution of pions and the corresponding systematic uncertainty are larger .    to improve electron identification at large momenta",
    ", the energy deposited in the ec was used .",
    "starting from momenta of 2.7  ( gev / c ) , pions begin to emit cherenkov light in the cc . in this region",
    ", however , the ec becomes very efficient in the separation of electrons from pions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and moreover , the ratio of pion to electron yields drops down very quickly .",
    "electrons passing through the ec release 30% of their energy on average , while pion losses are constant .",
    "this ec property was exploited at large particle momenta for electron - pion separation by selecting particles with the energy fraction released in the ec above 20% .",
    "more details on this procedure can be found in ref .",
    "furthermore , pions just above the cherenkov threshold emit a small amount of light with respect to electrons of the same momenta , and therefore , were also removed by the cut on the number of photo - electrons .",

    "<S> inclusive electron scattering off the deuteron has been measured to extract the deuteron structure function @xmath0 with the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement covers the entire resonance region from the quasi - elastic peak up to the invariant mass of the final - state hadronic system @xmath1  gev with four - momentum transfers @xmath2 from @xmath3 to @xmath4  ( gev / c)@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these data are complementary to previous measurements of the proton structure function @xmath0 and cover a similar two - dimensional region of @xmath2 and bjorken variable @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> determination of the deuteron @xmath0 over a large @xmath6 interval including the quasi - elastic peak as a function of @xmath2 , together with the other world data , permit a direct evaluation of the structure function moments for the first time . by fitting the @xmath2 evolution of these moments with an ope - based twist expansion we have obtained a separation of the leading twist and higher twist terms . </S>",
    "<S> the observed @xmath2 behaviour of the higher twist contribution suggests a partial cancellation of different higher twists entering into the expansion with opposite signs . </S>",
    "<S> this cancellation , found also in the proton moments , is a manifestation of the `` duality '' phenomenon in the @xmath0 structure function . </S>"
