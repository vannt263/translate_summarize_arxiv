    "sections 2 and 4 of this note are concerned with degree 2 elliptic subfields @xmath2 of a genus 2 function field @xmath3 ( all function fields are over an algebraically closed field @xmath4 of char .",
    "@xmath5 ) .",
    "jacobi @xcite already noted that in this case @xmath3 has generators @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 this generalized an example of legendre . in the newer literature , cassels @xcite chapter 14 deals with arithmetic aspects of this .",
    "gaudry / schost @xcite show that a genus 2 field @xmath3 in @xmath9 has at most two elliptic subfields of degree 2 , up to isomorphism , and compute the j - invariants of these elliptic subfields in terms of igusa invariants of @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , there is a group theoretic aspect .",
    "degree 2 elliptic subfields of @xmath3 correspond to * elliptic involutions * in the automorphism group of @xmath3 i.e. involutions different from the hyperelliptic involution @xmath10 .",
    "thus our topic is intimately related with the structure of @xmath11 , and its quotient @xmath12 by @xmath13 .",
    "geyer @xcite classifies the possibilities for @xmath12 , gives a brief discussion of @xmath14 and also notes some consequences for isogenies between elliptic subfields .",
    "his exposition is very brief because the main focus of his paper is on a different theme .",
    "we study the structure of @xmath14 in section 3 . we give a simple classification , based on group - theoretic properties of central extensions of @xmath12 , and relate it to our @xmath15-parameterization of @xmath0 ( see below ) .",
    "it follows that the number of @xmath14-classes of degree 2 elliptic subfields of @xmath3 is 0 , 1 or 2 ; and this number is 1 if and only if @xmath3 has equation  @xmath16 .",
    "brandt / stichtenoth @xcite more generally discuss automorphisms of hyperelliptic curves ( in characteristic 0 ) , whereas brandt @xcite ( unpublished thesis ) has a very comprehensive classification of automorphism groups of hyperelliptic curves in any characteristic and more generally , cyclic extensions of genus 0 fields .",
    "the purpose of this note is to combine these two aspects , the geometric and the group theoretic one .",
    "e.g. , gaudry / schost use only the reduced automorphism group , using @xmath14 itself would simplify their paper .",
    "they exclude characteristics 3 and 5 where other types of automorphism groups appear .    in section 2 and 4 we study the locus @xmath0 of genus 2 fields with elliptic subfields of degree 2 .",
    "geyer @xcite states that @xmath0 is a rational surface whose singular locus is the curve corresponding to reduced automorphism group @xmath17 ( see our section 3 , case iii ) .",
    "we give an explicit birational parametrization of @xmath0 by parameters @xmath18 ; they are obtained by setting @xmath19 in ( 1 ) and symmetrizing @xmath20 by an action of @xmath21 .",
    "more precisely , those @xmath18 parametrize genus 2 fields together with an elliptic involution of the reduced automorphism group ( thm [ sect1_thm ] ) .",
    "we express the j - invariants of degree 2 elliptic subfields in terms of @xmath18 .",
    "the particular case that these j - invariants are all equal ( for a fixed genus 2 field ) yields a birational embedding of the moduli space @xmath22 of genus 1 curves into @xmath1 .",
    "in section 4 we use the coordinates on @xmath23 and @xmath0 provided by invariant theory . expressing these coordinates in terms of our @xmath15-parameters",
    "makes the parametrization of @xmath0 explicit . from this",
    "we confirm the explicit equation found by gaudry / schost @xcite that is satisfied by all points of @xmath0 ; and we see directly that @xmath0 is the full zero set of this equation .",
    "more generally , there is literature on degree @xmath24 elliptic subfields , e.g. , frey @xcite , and frey and kani @xcite , and lange @xcite .",
    "the first author s phd thesis @xcite deals with the case @xmath25 .",
    "we further intend to study the cases @xmath26 and 7 .    in the last section",
    ", we study the action of aut@xmath27 on elliptic subfields @xmath28 of odd degree @xmath29 .",
    "the hyperelliptic involution fixes these subfields , hence they are permuted by @xmath12 .",
    "it is asy to see that stabilizer @xmath30 in @xmath12 of f has order @xmath31 .",
    "we study those cases where @xmath32 , assuming @xmath33 .",
    "this allows us to use riemann s existence theorem to parametrize the extensions @xmath34 of degree @xmath24 with non - trivial automorphisms by certain triples of permutations in @xmath35 . to count",
    "the number of these triples of permutations is a difficult problem for general @xmath24 .",
    "we use a computer search to construct all such triples for @xmath36 .",

    "it is the fixed field of the * hyperelliptic involution * @xmath41 in @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath41 is central in @xmath42 . here and in the following , @xmath42 denotes the group @xmath43 , more precisely .",
    "it induces a subgroup of @xmath44 which is naturally isomorphic to @xmath45 .",
    "the latter is called the * reduced automorphism group * of @xmath3 .",
    "an * elliptic involution * of @xmath46 is an involution different from @xmath41 .",
