    "the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath8 , has undergone continual refinement ( for history and experimental details , see@xcite,@xcite ) to the point where @xmath9 is now very precisely known@xcite : @xmath10 the experimental technique employs muons trapped in a storage ring .",
    "a uniform magnetic field @xmath11 is applied perpendicular to the orbit of the muons ; hence the muon spin will precess .",
    "the signal is a discrepancy between the observed precession and cyclotron frequencies .",
    "precession of the muon spin is determined indirectly from the decay @xmath12 .",
    "electrons emerge from the decay vertex with a characteristic angular distribution which in the standard model ( sm ) has the following form in the rest frame of the muon : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the angle between the momentum of the electron e and the spin of the muon , @xmath15 measures the fraction of the maximum available energy which the electron carries , and @xmath16 are particular functions which peak at @xmath17 .",
    "the detectors ( positioned along the perimeter of the ring ) accept the passage of only the highest energy electrons in order to maximize the angular asymmetry in ( [ asymm ] ) . in this way",
    ", the electron count rate is modulated at the frequency @xmath18 .",
    "the leading theoretical prediction of @xmath19 in the sm is @xmath20 @xcite which leads to a @xmath21 deviation from the data : @xmath22 if this discrepancy persists as more data arrives and theoretical uncertainties improve , then there is a clear signal of new physics . many proposals to account for this discrepancy have already appeared in the literature .",
    "this letter is a consideration of a novel effect on the measurement of @xmath19 from @xmath23 , a theory in which the coordinates of spacetime become noncommuting operators : @xmath24=i \\theta_{\\mu \\nu}$ ] .",
    "there is an extensive collection of papers devoted to both the theoretical foundations of @xmath23@xcite and its phenomenology@xcite .",
    "the reader may consult the above references for a more thorough understanding of the @xmath0 quantum field theory underlying the present calculation .",
    "we will employ perturbation theory in leading powers of the dimensionful matrix of parameters @xmath25 in accord with the work done in @xcite .",
    "although @xmath19 does receive a sizable contribution from @xmath23 , it is a _ constant _",
    "contribution@xcite , @xmath26 the interaction with the external magnetic field @xmath27 is independent of the muon spin , and therefore the experiment described above is not sensitive to this perturbation of @xmath19 .",
    "the effect of @xmath23 on this measurement does however enter in the manner in which the muon spin is measured in its decay .",
    "each of the w - boson vertices in the decay diagram fig.[muonfig](a ) receives corrections from @xmath23 at the one loop level , as shown in fig.[muonfig](b ) .",
    "one might expect such corrections to be negligable , but in fact the loop integral in fig.[muonfig](b ) involves @xmath28-dependent vertices which lead to integrals of the form @xmath29 for loop momenta much larger than the external momenta @xmath30 . in the limit",
    "@xmath31 the integral ( [ loop ] ) formally diverges so one has to renormalize carefully ( see @xcite for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "the generic size of the @xmath0 contribution will be @xmath32 which for fast muons ( @xmath33 at bnl ) and low scales of noncommutivity ( @xmath34 ) gives a suppression factor of @xmath35 relative to the tree level decay diagram .",
    "since the current deviation of the sm prediction from experiment in ( [ deviate ] ) is of this size , we see that @xmath0 effects can not be neglected on the basis of their magnitude .",
    "more importantly , the appearance of the antisymmetric object @xmath25 in the decay amplitude leads to combinations of the muon and electron spins and momenta which alter the modulation frequency of the decay rate ( [ asymm ] ) .",
    "specifically , one anticipates factors of ( @xmath36 which for electron momenta close to their kinetmatical limit ( @xmath26 @xmath17 ) behaves like @xmath37 . in what follows",
    "we explicitly demonstrate these terms exist in the decay rate .",
    "[ sec : calc ]    define the muon decay amplitude @xmath38 involving the electron , muon , and neutrino(@xmath39 ) spinors and the most general set of operators at the interaction vertices , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) which may depend on momenta .",
    "the muon decay rate is proportional to the squared matrix element @xmath42 this is a product of two terms : the electron trace @xmath43 and the muon trace @xmath44 . if @xmath28 were zero , all operators would be of the standard @xmath3 form , and the traces would be @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the muon mass and we neglect the mass of the electron in this and all that follows .",
    "the lowest order contribution from @xmath23 will be proportional to one power of @xmath28 , so to extract it one calculates the contribution to @xmath47 from each way it is possible to change one @xmath3 operator into a @xmath0 one , giving altogether twenty @xmath48 terms in @xmath47 . to find the precise form of these operators , we next calculate the loop . in fig.[loopfig ]",
    "we show the loop with incoming charged lepton momentum @xmath49 and outgoing neutrino momentum @xmath50 .",
    "the loop amplitude is    @xmath51 \\frac{-i g_{\\gamma \\delta}}{(k - q)^2 - m_w^2 } \\frac{i}{\\slashchar{k } - m}[-ie \\gamma^\\alpha]\\frac{-i g_{\\alpha \\beta}}{(p - k)^2 } u(p ) \\\\ & \\times g [ g^{\\eta \\beta}(q+k-2p)^\\delta + g^{\\beta \\delta}(q+p-2k)^\\eta     + g^{\\eta \\delta}(k+p-2q)^\\beta ] exp[i k \\cdot \\theta \\cdot ( p - q ) ] \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    which becomes @xmath52 now using the on - shell condition @xmath53 and only retaining terms which couple @xmath25 to the overall dirac structure we arrive at @xmath54 of the above terms in the numerator , the dominant one is the tensor piece of @xmath55 , @xmath26 the one proportional to @xmath56 , since it has the most powers of @xmath57 . to compute its effect , we consider first the alteration of the electron trace , keeping the @xmath3 vertices of the muon trace intact . this tensor part of the electron trace @xmath43 is @xmath58 which , after some dirac algebra , dotting into the sm muon trace ( [ traces ] ) , and integration over the neutrino momenta @xmath59 ( since these are not observed ) gives @xmath60 the other half of the calculation , keeping the electron trace fixed and inserting @xmath28-dependent operators into the muon trace , yields a very similar result . for high electron momenta , the muon neutrino and electron antineutrino momenta are approximately opposite that of the electron , forcing the spin of the electron to match the spin of the muon .",
    "in this case the product @xmath61 becomes approximately @xmath37 since @xmath62 and @xmath25 is antisymmetric .",
    "this upsets the @xmath63 angular dependence that the sm predicts in ( [ asymm ] ) potentially at the level of 1 part in @xmath4 .",
    "it is interesting not only that @xmath23 can account for the recent measurement of @xmath19 if the scale of noncommutivity is of the order of @xmath64 , but also that a @xmath0 spacetime at this energy can account for @xmath65 and possibly some of the @xmath66 observables in @xmath11-meson physics @xcite .",
    "the caveat however is that @xmath25 , being an intrinsically directional object , is subject to being averaged away if experiments collect and average data over time scales of days or longer due to the rotation of the earth . in a storage ring such as",
    "the one at bnl , the circulation of the muons at their cyclotron frequency introduces an additional averaging of the components of @xmath28 , so some of the effects of @xmath23 are bound to be projected away .",
    "nonetheless , it is hoped that experimenters will look for a time - varying effect in the data for @xmath19 which would be a definite positive signal of @xmath23 .",
