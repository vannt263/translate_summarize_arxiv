    "depending on the strength of the two - body interaction , the trapped bosons are in two regimes : mean - field regime when the particles are weakly interacting which can be described by the gross - pitaevskii equation , and hard - core bosons ( commonly known as tonks - girardeau gas ) when the interaction is strong enough which can be described by the lieb - liniger model of @xmath0-interacting 1d bosons @xcite .",

    "the low - density limit corresponds to the case of infinitely strong interactions .",
    "we are interested to study the bose systems with infinitely strong interactions at zero temperature by using the quantized hydrodynamic approximation .",
