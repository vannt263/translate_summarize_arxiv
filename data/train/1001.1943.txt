    "while the studies of igm absorption - lines usually need a bright background source , such as a qso or a gamma - ray burst , @xcite claimed the existence of an overdense region of the igm at @xmath3 using a galaxy , a1689 - 7.1 at @xmath13 , which is lensed by the foreground massive galaxy cluster a1689 at @xmath14 .    in the spectrum of a1689 - 7.1 ,",
    "the hi flux transmission at @xmath15   ( ly@xmath4 hi absorption - lines at @xmath16 ) is only @xmath17 of the average value at the same redshift derived from @xmath18 qso spectra , suggesting that this overdensity of inter - galactic h i gas clouds around a1689 - 7.1 extends at least @xmath1980 comoving mpc along the line of sight .",
    "although individual h i absorption - lines could not be resolved at the resolution of their spectrum , they claimed that this structure is likely to be made by overlapping of many intergalactic h i gas clouds rather than a few overlapping of very high h i column density clouds , because of absence of metal absorption - lines from these clouds on the continuum long - ward of the ly@xmath4 emission .",
    "such a large - scale igm overdense region would provide us with an unique opportunity to study the formation of galaxies within baryonic large - scale structure at @xmath3 .",
    "although there have been several high-@xmath20 emission - line galaxy searches targeting qso absorption - line systems , the targets for most of these searches were absorption - line systems by very high h i column density clouds , such as damped ly@xmath4 absorbers rather than large - scale overdense regions of low h i column density clouds .",
    "@xcite claimed that this igm structure may be an example of the earliest phase of baryonic large - scale structure that subsequently evolve into the filamentary cosmic web of galaxies ( including clusters of galaxies ) observed in the present - day universe .",
    "how can we test the possibility ? does the igm overdense region already contain galaxies and even galaxy overdensities ?",
    "if the overdensity of galaxies exists , what is the size , density , and morphology of the structure ? in order to answer these questions , we undertook a wide - field , deep ly@xmath4 imaging survey for emission - line galaxies at @xmath21 in the a1689 field .    in this letter , we use ab magnitudes and adopt cosmological parameters , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 .",
