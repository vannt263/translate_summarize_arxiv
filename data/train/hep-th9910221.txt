    "further there are a lot of interesting properties which by the standard model are accounted for in a very abstract way .",
    "a prominent problem is the running of the couplings .",
    "the naivly formulated action turns out to predict only useless infinite numbers .",
    "a redefinition of the theory is necessary . in the renormalisation procedure",
    "it turns out that the theory can only be formulated in a consistent way if the coupling `` constant '' varies with the transfered momentum , a property which is reproduced very well in high energy experiments . in the standard model",

    "the vacuum of quantum field theory turns out to be a most complicated state .",
    "the qcd vacuum , the vacuum of quantum chromo dynamics , seems to account for the confinement of colour charges only , if it has the properties of a magnetic medium . in this sense quantum field theory",
    "has reintroduced the concept of ether in a form which is compatible with relativity .",
    "there are further many well established and accepted effects which could ask for some deeper understanding",
    ". to this group belong the well known relativistic properties of particles , like the velocity dependence of mass , lorentz contraction and time dilatation which are usually derived from the basic lorentz transformation properties and in this way not accessible to an intuitive understanding .",
    "there are questions which occupy the mind of physicists since decades like the einstein - rosen - podolsky paradox and the absence of magnetic monopoles .    from an extreme point of view",
    "one could compare the high level of abstaction of theoretical physics with the epicycles in the ptolemaeic world system and hope for a more intuitive explanation of physical phenomena .",

    "gauge theories , the basic theories for the standard model , treat fundamental fermions as point - like particles .",
    "the fermionic determinant in the path integral formulation of quantum field theory turns out to be a summation over all possible pathes of these point - like fermions .",

    "a long standing puzzle in this connection is the so called fermion doubling problem .",

    "the fundamental idea of gauge theories is the existence of a local coordinate system for the internal degrees of freedom like weak - isospin or colour and the independence of all observations from the orientation of this system .",
    "one of the basic ideas of our model is that gauge theories need only be reproduced at large distances from charges . at short distances",

    "<S> we introduce a model designed to describe charged particles as stable topological solitons of a field with values on the internal space @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these solitons behave like particles with relativistic properties like lorentz contraction and velocity dependence of mass . </S>",
    "<S> this mass is defined by the energy of the soliton . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> this model is a generalisation of the sine  </S>",
    "<S> gordon model from 1 + 1 dimensions to 3 + 1 dimensions , from @xmath1 to @xmath0 . for large distances from the center of solitons </S>",
    "<S> this model tends to a dual @xmath2-theory with freely propagating electromagnetic waves . </S>",
    "<S> already at the classical level it describes important effects , which usually have to be explained by quantum field theory , like particle - antiparticle annihilation and the running of the coupling . </S>"
