    "since its experimental discovery , graphene has become a hot topic in solid state physics  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the similarities between the effective single - particle hamiltonian for graphene in the low - energy regime and the dirac equation for massless particles have been noted  @xcite and lead to the prediction of `` relativistic effects '' in graphene .",
    "one example is the non - transient _ zitterbewegung _ in the presence of an external magnetic field  @xcite . in order to study the _ zitterbewegung _ and other transport effects in graphene one needs to solve the time - dependent dirac equation with high accuracy and efficiency .",
    "previous time - dependent propagation methods have often been restricted to eigenstate decompositions .",
    "however , the evaluation of integrals involving a finite set of eigenfunctions is cumbersome and also limited to energetically low lying eigenstates .",
    "additionally the eigenstate approach can only be used if the analytic solutions are known , since the numerical determination of a full set of energy eigenstates is in general not feasible .    in section [ wppropagation ]",
    "we show that the prior knowledge of the eigenstates is not required in order to obtain a reliable solution of the time - dependent dirac - hamiltonian of graphene .",
    "our algorithm is accurate up to the machine error and stable for any propagation time .",
    "in addition it is very flexible and thus allows us to calculate the time - evolution in inhomogeneous magnetic fields and arbitrary potential landscapes . in section [ wprevivals ]",
    "we study quantitatively the scattering in realistic potentials and obtain the fidelity ( which is related to the mobility ) of graphene in a magnetic field . for wave - packets with large initial momenta we reveal a rich collapse and revival structure , which has a strong similarity to the dynamics of highly excited states of rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "we derive analytic results for the semiclassical expectation value of the position operator and the autocorrelation function which are in very good agreement with the numerical results .",
    "subsequently , we study the effect of an impurity potential and analyse the suppression of the autocorrelation function corresponding to a rapid fidelity decay .",
    "interestingly , revivals in the centre - of - mass coordinate survive the disorder - perturbations if the correlation length of the potential is on the order of the cyclotron radii of the occupied states . in general , our algorithm provides a basic method to model time - dependent transport through mesoscopic systems  @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of graphene is obtained from the tight binding model of the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice . in the resulting band structure two inequivalent vanishing bandgaps ( often referred to as different valleys or dirac points ) appear , which are located at the corners of the brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "the band structure around each dirac point is conveniently described in the framework of an effective @xmath0 perturbation theory and the resulting hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 has the same structure as the @xmath2 dimensional dirac hamiltonian , where the velocity is given by @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 denote the corresponding pauli matrices  @xcite .",
    "the linear approximation is valid for energies close to the dirac points . for higher energies",
    "the trigonal warping gets important  @xcite .",
    "we neglect this effect here , since we only consider wave packets which can be decomposed into eigenstates from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonians at the two dirac points are obtained by switching the sign of @xmath8 . here",
    ", we study the bulk region of a sheet of graphene and therefore we can neglect effects of the boundaries which may couple the valleys and induce symmetry breaking  @xcite .    in the following we present a new algorithm for the propagation of a wave - packet on a sheet of graphene in an anisotropic magnetic field @xmath9 oriented perpendicularly to the sheet .",
    "the hamiltonian can also contain a position - dependent potential landscape @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting system is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath11 for simplicity we only use the hamiltonian with @xmath12 , but it is straightforward to apply the same algorithm to the second dirac point .",
    "the vector potential of the magnetic field @xmath13 is connected to the magnetic field @xmath14 and enters the hamiltonian as @xmath15 . as initial state of the system",
    "we choose an arbitrary two spinor wavefunction @xmath16 .",
    "the action of the time - evolution operator on the wavefunction is given by @xmath17 in principle , there exist several possibilities to calculate the action of the time - evolution operator . for a system with a discrete set of eigenstates defined by @xmath18 a favourable way is given by the expansion in eigenstates .",
    "in this case , the time - evolution becomes @xmath19 such a propagation algorithm was already used in references  @xcite to evaluate the _ zitterbewegung _ in graphene and also for other semiconductor materials  @xcite . due to the lack of analytical known solutions of the dirac equation , this scheme can only be applied to a limited set of problems .",
    "thus it is favourable to develop an algorithm which does not require any knowledge of the eigenstates and can be applied to arbitrary mesoscopic systems .",
    "a similar starting point exists in quantum chemistry , where no analytic solutions are known for the molecular potential energy surfaces . in all these cases it is favourable to use an algorithm which directly gives the time - evolution of the system without evaluating all eigenstates first  @xcite .",
    "all relevant information about stationary properties , i.e.  the energy spectrum or the green s function and the local density of states , is encoded in time - dependent observables , which are extracted afterwards from the time - evolved wave - packet  @xcite .    for the time - dependent solution of the dirac hamiltonian",
    ", we use a reliable and efficient algorithm based upon the polynomial expansion of the propagator in chebyshev polynomials  @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the algorithm is to expand the time - evolution operator on the interval @xmath20 $ ] using a set of chebyshev polynomials , which are particularly suitable since they distribute the numerical error of the expansion equally on the whole interval . as a first step",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath21 have to be projected into the interval of the expansion by introducing a normalised hamiltonian @xmath22 the scaling - energy @xmath23 has to be big enough to cover all eigenenergies contributing to the initial wave - packet . with the aid of the time - evolution",
    "is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the series of chebyshev polynomials of the first kind .",
    "the expansion coefficients are given by @xmath26 with the bessel function @xmath27 .",
    "only the action of the polynomial of @xmath28 on the initial state is needed to calculate the time - evolution .",
    "thus it is sufficient to recursively calculate the vectors @xmath29 by the following modified recursion relations for chebyshev polynomials : @xmath30 in order to avoid the fermion doubling problem of a simple first - order nearest - neighbour derivative  @xcite we use a fourier representation of the spinors and apply the kinetic energy operator in momentum space  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to introduce certain non - local first - order derivatives  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the action of the normalised hamiltonian acting on a two spinor wavefunction @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for the two - dimensional fast fourier transform .",
    "this type of propagation algorithm allows us to evaluate the time - evolution of the wave - packet for arbitrary long propagation times , as long as the wavefunction does not leave the region of interest . a good measure of the propagation quality is given by the comparison of the analytic autocorrelation function for the homogeneous magnetic field with the numerical result .",
    "our results show that the maximum error is indeed on the order of the unavoidable finite machine precision .",
    "in contrast to all other propagation algorithms for graphene we are able to incorporate arbitrarily shaped potentials and also inhomogeneous magnetic fields in our configurations .",
    "in the following we apply the propagation algorithm to an infinite sheet of graphene put in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath35 and set the potential @xmath10 to zero .",
    "this system was proposed by rusin _ et .",
    "@xcite and schliemann  @xcite to study the non - transient _ zitterbewegung _ of a wave - packet on graphene .",
    "the eigenstates of the dirac hamiltonian in a perpendicular magnetic field are known and given by the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions  @xcite . in the lowest landau level , the ground state wavefunction has gaussian shape and is located on one sublattice . as initial condition",
    "we consider a kicked gaussian of the form @xmath36 the width is taken as @xmath37 and the initial momentum @xmath38 can point along any direction in the @xmath39 plane , but is set to @xmath40 in the following .",
    "the pseudospin @xmath41 of the wave - packet is determined by the phase - relation between the two spinor entries . for @xmath42 ,",
    "the wave - packet is mostly electron - like since the momentum is pointing along the @xmath43-direction .",
    "consequently the wave - packet is mostly hole - like if @xmath44 and a mixture of both states for intermediate angles .    during the propagation we track several observables , including the expectation value of the position operator @xmath45 we refer to @xmath46 as the `` centre - of - mass '' although the calculated motion describes massless particles .",
    "the trembling motion of the centre - of - mass is visible in the videos linked from ( a ) for different initial setups . another important property , the local pseudospin , is given by @xmath47 at each gridpoint @xmath48 and colour coded in the video .",
    "the local pseudospin reveals the local electron or hole character of the wave - packet and shows an anti - symmetry with respect to the @xmath49-axis if the pseudospin of the initial state is oriented orthogonal to the initial momentum .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     an advantage of our method is the extraction of stationary properties , like the local density of states ( ldos ) and the green s function , out of the time - evolution  @xcite .",
    "for example the relative strength of each energy eigenstate with respect to the initial state is given by the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xmath50 the same concept allows us to calculate the @xmath51 drift motion and eigenstates in the quantum hall regime of graphene for high bias currents  @xcite .",
    "the ldos is given by the laplace transformation of the autocorrelation function @xmath52 as shown in ( b ) the ldos of the trembling wave - packet reveals pronounced peaks at the energies of the landau levels @xmath53 .",
    "the peak height ( which is proportional to the enclosed area in the ldos ) indicates the overlap of the initial gaussian wave - packet with the different hermite polynomials of the landau levels . for @xmath54 ,",
    "mostly electrons are occupied whereas for @xmath55 holes and electrons are equally occupied .",
    "our computational scheme derives the overlap information without calculating the numerically unstable integrals over hermite polynomials used in previous methods .",
    "therefore we can increase the initial momentum @xmath56 of the wave - packet and study the quantum mechanical propagation of high landau levels .",
    "the trembling motion on graphene is present since both , electron and hole - like states , contribute to the initial wave - packet . for high initial momenta",
    "the index of the average landau level is given by @xmath57 which follows from the semiclassical quantisation condition .",
    "our quantum mechanical calculations support this assertion as shown in the ldos of .",
    "( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "the hole - like contributions are approximately 400 times smaller than the electron - like parts .",
    "the red dots show the position of the analytical landau levels as well as the probability distribution used for the following approximations . [ highkick_ldos ] ]    a strongly kicked gaussian wave - packet mostly occupies one energy branch if the initial pseudospin is parallel to the initial momentum . for an initial momentum which puts the gaussian wave - packet into the @xmath60 landau level ,",
    "the hole contributions are 400 times smaller compared to the electron parts .",
    "in such a scenario the trembling motion may be neglected and other interesting revival phenomena appear . in atomic physics revival effects",
    "are commonly observed for valence electrons in the coulomb potential of rydberg atoms and have been studied in theory  @xcite as well as in experiments  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite contains a recent review about revivals of quantum wave - packets . in order to get an idea about the rich revival structure of a quantum wave - packet on graphene",
    ", it is instructing to look at the numerical results in and the corresponding video .",
    "wave - packet revivals are typically not present in semiconducting material in a perpendicular magnetic field since there the dynamics is governed by a purely quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "graphene and toplogical insulators form their own class due to their non - quadratic hamilton operators .    .",
    "the red pin stands for the quantum mechanical centre - of - mass , whereas the green pin is calculated with the semiclassical expression .",
    "the initial wave - packet in ( a ) was chosen such that the contributing eigenstates follow the gaussian distribution with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , leading to a poincar cyclotron time of @xmath63 . during the time - evolution",
    "the centre - of - mass collapses to the centre of a circular wavefunction and later shows pronounced revivals .",
    "for example ( b ) displays a quarter revival at @xmath64 , ( c ) a third revival at @xmath65 and ( d ) a half revival at @xmath66 .",
    "all revivals have specific symmetries which also occur in the subsequent revivals .",
    "after a certain time a localised wave - packet emerges in ( e ) as a mirror revival at @xmath67 . in this case , the quantum mechanical centre - of - mass is at the opposite side compared to the semiclassical centre - of - mass .",
    "this phenomenon has already been seen in rydberg revivals  @xcite .",

    "a small deviation is visible which stems from the fact that the centre - of - mass of the initial wave - packet has already a strong angular dispersion ( see ) and thus the average cyclotron radius @xmath82 is overestimated .",

    "then the centre - of - mass collapses again and produces a full revival at @xmath102 .",
    "a way to remove the structure of the impurity potential is extracting the corresponding velocity of the wave - packet out of the centre - of - mass motion @xmath144 which is shown in ( d ) .",
    "the initial wave - packet moves on the circular orbit with a velocity slightly smaller than the `` speed of light '' of graphene .",
    "when the centre - of - mass collapses this velocity drops down to the drift velocity of the wave - packet which is defined by the potential gradient and at least two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the revivals occur at the same time for all the impurity configurations .",
    "the substructure of the revivals can not be seen in the centre - of - mass motion of the wave - packet .",
    "however the full wavefunction shows fractional revivals ( ) .",
    "in reference  @xcite the centre - of - mass propagation was used to establish a dipole moment . in our case",
    "this dipole moment is maximal if the wave - packet revival takes place and almost zero if the wave - packet is collapsed similar to the velocity of the wave - packet in ( d ) .",
    "if such a dipole moment is experimentally measurable , the wave - packet revivals can be observed even if disorder displaces the wave - packet far away from its initial position .",
    "in this work we presented a new algorithm for the propagation of wave - packets on a sheet of graphene which allows us to calculate the time - evolution in arbitrary shaped potentials and inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "we studied time - dependent effects like the _ zitterbewegung _ , which is very pronounced in graphene .",
    "we focussed on wave - packet revivals , which occur in graphene due to the special structure of the landau levels .",
    "we gave a detailed explanation of the centre - of - mass motion and the autocorrelation function .",
    "the applied semiclassical description quantitatively revealed the collapse of the centre of mass as well as the revivals . from the autocorrelation function we extracted several different timescales which all signify various revivals .",
    "a detailed analysis of the autocorrelation function for different poincar times confirmed fractional revivals which have also been seen in our numerical calculations which supported the results throughout the whole work .",
    "finally we analysed the effect of impurities on the wave - packet revivals by a gaussian correlated model potential .",
    "our calculations showed that revivals in the autocorrelation are strongly suppressed due to the fidelity decay .",
    "in contrast to that the centre - of - mass revivals are still present if the correlation length of the impurity potential is long enough with respect to the average cyclotron radius .",
    "the here demonstrated long - time accuracy of the propagation algorithm opens the window towards realistic device simulations on the micrometre range , also including time - dependent external fields .",
    "we thank c.  petitjean , c.  kreisbeck , j.  wurm , m.  wimmer , m.  hartung , e.  j.  heller , c.  koch , k.  richter , j.  schliemann , and w.  p.  schleich for helpful discussions .",
    "this work is supported by the emmy - noether programme of the dfg ( kr 2889 - 2/1 ) .",
    "in the following we study the classical time - evolution of a wave - packet which is located around one of the dirac points and obtain the semiclassical quantisation . in order to be localised in position and momentum space",
    ", the initial wave - packet @xmath145 has to have a small extent in both coordinates .",
    "the expectation value of the position operator and the kinetic momentum are defined by @xmath146 niu _ et .",
    "al . _ have developed a framework to study the time - evolution of those observables for arbitrary hamilton operators  @xcite which we will apply in the following .",
    "as a first step we analyse the free solutions of the hamiltonian and classify the resulting bands by the index @xmath147 . for the dirac hamiltonian of graphene we have electron - like ( @xmath148 ) and hole - like states ( @xmath149 ) with the corresponding energy dispersion @xmath150 .",
    "then it is possible to construct a wave - packet which is restricted to one band .",
    "the time - evolution of the momentum and the centre of this wave - packet are defined by two coupled equations of motion @xmath151 where @xmath152 stands for an isotropic magnetic field perpendicular to the plane and @xmath153 is a position dependent electric potential .",
    "the berry curvature @xmath154 enters the equations of motion in momentum space but is zero in the case of a gap - less perfect sheet of graphene . as a result of the linear dispersion",
    ", relation reduces to @xmath155 and therefore describes a centre - of - mass which always travels with the speed @xmath156 parallel or antiparallel to the wave vector @xmath38 . for a vanishing electric field",
    "the two coupled equations of motion can be solved .",
    "the momentum of the wave - packet is controlled by the differential equation @xmath157 given by which is solved by @xmath158 where the initial momentum of the wave - packet is given by @xmath56 in direction @xmath159 .",
    "the cyclotron frequency depends on the momentum and is given by @xmath160 the resulting real space propagation is given by @xmath161 thus electron - like and hole - like states propagate in opposite directions on orbits with the radius @xmath162 in order to obtain the quantisation of the landau levels from the closed cyclotron orbits we have to study the phase changes along the trajectories .",
    "the main contribution is given by the classical action known from the electron case , while an additional contribution comes from berry s phase .",
    "although the berry curvature is vanishing , berry s phase  @xcite is still present and defined by the vector potential @xmath163 and the spinor parts @xmath164 of the free solutions of the hamiltonian .",
    "the free solutions are given by @xmath165 where @xmath159 is the direction of the vector @xmath38 .",
    "hence we get a vector potential of @xmath166 which is used to calculate the additional phase - change @xmath167 for an arbitrary adiabatic transition on the path @xmath168 in momentum space .",
    "the result is berry s phase @xmath169 for a single closed orbit on graphene  @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic transition in momentum space is automatically fulfilled in a magnetic field , since all trajectories are cyclotron orbits and thus sufficiently smooth .",
    "the classical phase change and berry s phase have to be added up to build a new ebk quantisation condition which reads  @xcite @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the maslov index depending on the caustics traversed on one cyclotron orbit ( here @xmath172 ) . plugging the formula for the cyclotron motion in the quantisation condition the resulting landau levels",
    "are given by @xmath173 if we define the landau level index @xmath70 differently for hole - like and electron - like states the momentum quantisation yields @xmath174 all the other quantised parameters follow from the relations calculated before @xmath175",
