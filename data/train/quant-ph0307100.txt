    "what is more , in teleportation this description is not needed at all : both the sender and the receiver act physically on the state ( i.e.  by quantum operations : completely positive and trace preserving linear maps ) , and the process can be used to transmit parts of entangled states faithfully .",

    "@xcite , and here two new phenomena occur : in  @xcite it is shown that at the cost of possibly spending more entanglement one can reduce the classical communication to @xmath0 cbit per qubit in the asymptotics ; and there is a trade  off between the classical and the quantum resources needed , of which @xcite and  @xcite provide bounds . in the present work we put these results into their definite form by proving a formula for the exact trade  off curve and by improving on the result of  @xcite to use only @xmath0 cbit and @xmath0 ebit per qubit .    by a protocol for _ remote state preparation ( r.s.p . )",

    "the protocol prescribes how to use these in a sequence of steps ( based on the previous exchange of messages in the protocol , and on @xmath6 for the sender ) , resulting in a state @xmath7 held by the receiver .",

    "the justification of this choice is that it seems to be the one best suited to the asymptotic considerations at our focus .",
    "however , as the following table shows , our conclusions are for the most part independent of the particulars of the model :    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the entries `` @xmath0 ebit , @xmath0 cbit '' derive their achievability from our protocol @xmath87 ( theorem  [ thm : univ : rsp ] )  directly in the cases `` probabilistic exact '' , `` high fidelity '' and `` approximately oblivious '' ( see the following subsection ) , and augmented by teleportation in the failure event for `` deterministic exact , expected cost '' .",
    "the upper bound `` @xmath0 ebit , @xmath1 cbits '' is of course teleportation , which indeed is oblivious ( see the following subsection ) ; that in the oblivious case @xmath1 cbits are indeed necessary was shown in  @xcite .",

    "the classical reverse shannon theorem  @xcite gives a deterministic exact protocol for this task at an expected cbit cost approaching the simulated channel s classical capacity @xmath193 in the limit of large block size , but it is not hard to show that for some channels any such exact efficient simulation must 1 ) have a worst - case cost exceeding its expected cost , and 2 ) must be non  oblivious to the receiver . for example consider a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability @xmath64 and capacity @xmath363 .",

    "<S> remote state preparation is the variant of quantum state teleportation in which the sender knows the quantum state to be communicated . </S>",
    "<S> the original paper introducing teleportation established minimal requirements for classical communication and entanglement but the corresponding limits for remote state preparation have remained unknown until now : previous work has shown , however , that it not only requires less classical communication but also gives rise to a trade  off between these two resources in the appropriate setting . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this problem from first principles , including the various choices one may follow in the definitions of the actual resources .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is a general method of remote state preparation for arbitrary states of many qubits , at a cost of @xmath0 bit of classical communication and @xmath0 bit of entanglement per qubit sent . in this `` universal '' formulation , </S>",
    "<S> these ebit and cbit requirements are shown to be simultaneously optimal by exhibiting a dichotomy . </S>",
    "<S> our protocol then yields the exact trade  off curve for memoryless sources of pure states ( including the case of incomplete knowledge of the ensemble probabilities ) , based on the recently established quantum  classical trade  off for visible quantum data compression . </S>",
    "<S> a variation of that method allows us to solve the even more general problem of preparing entangled states between sender and receiver ( i.e. , purifications of mixed state ensembles ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper includes an extensive discussion of our results , including the impact of the choice of model on the resources , the topic of obliviousness , and an application to private quantum channels and quantum data hiding . </S>"
