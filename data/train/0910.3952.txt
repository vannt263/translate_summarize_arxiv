    "<S> quantum correlations have been investigated with increasing success  @xcite , but what is the principle that limits them  @xcite ?    </S>",

    "<S> the existence of a finite upper bound on the speed of information is known as the principle of _ no - signaling_. this principle implies that if the events corresponding to alice s and bob s measurements are separated by space - like intervals , then alice can not send information to bob by just choosing a particular measurement setting . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , the probability distribution over possible outcomes on bob s side can not depend on alice s choice of measurement setting , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanics , like all modern physical theories , obeys the principle of no - signaling .    </S>",
    "<S> but is no - signaling the only limitation for correlations observed in nature ? </S>",
    "<S> bell  @xcite initiated the study of these limitations based on inequalities , such as the chsh expression  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to describe this inequality in terms of a game played by alice and bob . </S>",

    "<S> the probability that the players win is @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the probability that alice and bob obtain measurement outcomes @xmath5 and @xmath6 when performing the measurements @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively ( any pre- or post - processing can be taken as part of the measurement operation ) . </S>",
    "<S> classically , i.e. in any local realistic theory , this probability is bounded by  @xcite @xmath9 such an upper bound is called a bell inequality .    crucially , alice and bob can violate this inequality using quantum mechanics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bound is  @xcite @xmath10 and there exists a shared quantum state and measurements that achieve it  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , there is now compelling experimental evidence that nature violates bell inequalities and does not admit a local realistic description  @xcite . yet , there exist stronger no - signaling correlations ( outside quantum mechanics ) which achieve success probability @xmath11  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so why , then , is nt nature more non - local  @xcite ?    </S>",
    "<S> studying limitations on non - local correlations thus forms an essential element of understanding nature . on one hand </S>",
    "<S> , it provides a systematic method to both theoretically and experimentally compare candidate physical theories  @xcite . on the other hand , it crucially affects our understanding of information in different settings such as cryptography and communication complexity  @xcite . for example , if nature would admit @xmath11 , any two - party communication problem could be solved using only a single bit of communication , independent of its size  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , for the special case of the chsh inequality , it is known that the bound   is a consequence of information theoretic constraints such as uncertainty relations  @xcite or the recently proposed principle of information causality  @xcite . however , characterizing general correlations remains a difficult challenge  @xcite , and it is interesting to consider what other constraints may impose limits on quantum correlations .    * result . * we forge a fundamental link between local quantum theory and non - local quantum correlations . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> we show that if alice and bob are _ locally quantum _ , then relativity theory implies that their non - local correlations admit a quantum description . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of being locally quantum may thus provide another `` reason '' why the correlations we observe in nature are restricted by more than the principle of no - signaling itself . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : result ] states our result .    </S>",
    "<S> let us explain more formally what we mean by being _ locally quantum _ ( see also figure  [ fig : result ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we say that alice is locally quantum , if her physical system can be described by means of a hilbert space @xmath12 of some fixed finite dimension @xmath13 , on which she can perform _ any _ local quantum measurement ( povm ) @xmath14 given by bounded operators @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability @xmath16 that she obtains an outcome @xmath5 for measurement @xmath17 is given by a function @xmath18 $ ] applied to the povm elements . </S>",
    "<S> gleason s theorem for povm elements implies that the state of alice s system is then described by a state @xmath19  @xcite , and similarly for bob , where we use @xmath20 and @xmath21 to denote his hilbert space and measurements respectively . </S>",
    "<S> conceptually , this means that quantum mechanics describes alice and bob s local physical systems </S>",
    "<S> .    however , we make no a priori assumption about the nature of the joint system held by alice and bob . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we do not assume that it is described by a tensor product of their local hilbert spaces , or that their joint system is quantum mechanical . </S>",
    "<S> this means that alice and bob can share any possible _ preparation _ which assigns probabilities to _ local _ povm measurements . </S>",
    "<S> that is , their preparation is simply a function @xmath22 such that the probabilities of observing outcomes @xmath5 and @xmath6 for measurements @xmath17 and @xmath21 are given by @xmath23 . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the state of their joint system may not be described by any density matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we are able to show that just from the assumptions that alice and bob are locally quantum and that the no - signaling principle is obeyed , it follows that there exist a hilbert space @xmath24 , a state @xmath25 and measurements @xmath26 and @xmath27 for alice and bob , such that @xmath28 that is , all correlations can be reproduced quantum mechanically .    * implications . * </S>",
    "<S> our result solves an important piece of the puzzle of understanding non - local correlations , and their relation to the rich _ local _ phenomena we encounter in quantum theory such as bohr s complementarity principle , heisenberg uncertainty and kochen - specker non - contextuality . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it implies that if we obey local quantum statistics we can never hope to surpass a tsirelson - type bound on @xmath29 like that of  , ruling out the possibility of such striking differences with respect to information processing as those pointed out in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , _ if _ we were able to surpass such bounds , then the _ local _ systems of alice and bob could not be quantum .    </S>",
    "<S> other recent works also attempt to explain the limitations of quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the principle of information causality  @xcite starts with the assumption that nature demands that certain communication tasks should be hard to solve . </S>",
    "<S> together with the assumption of the no - signaling principle , this allows one to obtain tsirelson s bound for the special case of the chsh inequality . in our work </S>",
    "<S> , we also assume the no - signaling principle , but combine it with a different assumption , namely , that the world is locally quantum , that is , quantum mechanics correctly describes the laws of nature of local physical systems . making this assumption </S>",
    "<S> we recover the quantum limit on _ all _ possible non - local correlations ( not only the tsirelson s bound for the chsh inequality ) </S>",
    "<S> .        * proof . * to prove our result , we now proceed in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , we explain a known characterization of all no - signaling probability assignments to local quantum measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we use this characterization to show that the resulting correlations can be obtained in quantum mechanics .    _ from local quantum measurements to popt states : _ fix two finite dimensional hilbert spaces on alice and bob s sides . a local quantum measurement ( or povm ) </S>",
    "<S> consists of a pair of measurements @xmath30 and @xmath31 with outcome labels @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively on alice and bob s hilbert spaces . </S>",
    "<S> such povms are described by complex hermitian matrices @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , which sum to the identity , i.e. , @xmath37 ( see figure  [ fig : result ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a preparation shared between alice and bob assigns outcome probabilities @xmath38 to any choice of measurements @xmath30 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , it corresponds to a function @xmath22 on the pair of povm elements such that @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> kly , randall , and foulis  @xcite have shown ( see appendix ) that assuming no - signaling , the shared preparations ( or equivalently the functions @xmath22 ) are in one - to - one correspondence with matrices @xmath41 such that @xmath42 and   @xmath43 the matrices @xmath41 are called _ positive on pure tensors _ ( popt ) states . </S>",
    "<S> all quantum states are popt states , but there are popt states that do not correspond to quantum states  .    note that popt states can not be combined arbitrarily  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , not all entangled measurements ( measurements which are not a convex combination of tensor products @xmath44 ) of popt states are well defined because they would result in negative `` probabilities '' for non - quantum popts . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , if alice and bob share a popt , and charlie and bob share another one , then if alice and charlie come together , entangled measurements between their popts are not necessarily defined . </S>",
    "<S> this does not affect our result , since we are only interested in the case where we consider parties ( here alice and charlie together ) which are locally quantum .    </S>",
    "<S> _ from popt states to quantum correlations : _ we now show that there exist a quantum state @xmath45 and a map on povm measurements @xmath46 such that @xmath47 in order to do so , we associate to each popt state @xmath41 a map @xmath48 from matrices to matrices using the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , @xmath41 is obtained from @xmath48 by acting on bob s side of the ( projection on the ) maximally entangled state @xmath49 @xmath50    because @xmath41 is a popt , the associated map @xmath48 is positive , i.e. , it sends positive matrices to positive ones , but it may not be an admissible quantum operation . nevertheless , if @xmath48 still maps povms to povms we can obtain the popt correlations by moving the action of @xmath48 from the maximally entangled state to the measurement elements . in particular , if @xmath48 is unital ( @xmath51 ) , the map @xmath52 maps povm measurements to povm measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that   holds with @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath13 be the local dimension of alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath48 is unital we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the adjoint of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes   in the unital case .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , @xmath48 can be decomposed into a unital map and another map . </S>",
    "<S> this other map gives a quantum state @xmath45 by acting on @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath56 is defined in terms of the unital map as before . </S>",
    "<S> we finish the proof by showing that @xmath45 is well - normalized and   is satisfied . for a general positive map , </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath57 be the image of the identity , i.e. , @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath57 is normalized , @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume initially that @xmath57 is invertible , and define @xmath60 the map @xmath61 is unital . </S>",
    "<S> further , the quantum state @xmath62 given by @xmath63 is well - normalized , that is , @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> thus by defining @xmath56 as in   but in terms of @xmath61 we conclude @xmath65    if @xmath57 is not invertible , in order to define @xmath61 , one can start with the map @xmath66 , and then take the limit @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> * we have shown that being locally quantum is sufficient to ensure that all non - local correlations between distant parties can be reproduced quantum mechanically , if the principle of no - signaling is obeyed . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us a natural explanation of why quantum correlations are weaker than is required by the no - signaling principle alone , i.e. , given that one can describe local physics according to quantum measurements and states , then no - signaling already implies quantum correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to know whether our work can be used to derive more efficient tests for non - local quantum correlations than those proposed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is an intriguing question whether one can find new limits on our ability to perform information processing _ locally _ based on the limits of non - local correlations , which we now know to demand local quantum behavior .    </S>",
