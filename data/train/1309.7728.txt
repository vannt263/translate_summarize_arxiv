    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) , showing the electron dos for a kekul textured lattice , see inset . in excellent agreement with the experiments,@xcite </S>",

    "<S> practically , a constant strain field is introduced through displacement of the scattering centers , in polar coordinates @xmath42 , using @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the a parameter for the strength of the strain.@xcite    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( a ) we show the spectral density at the center of the lattice for strain conditions corresponding to a magnetic field of 60 t. in agreement with experiments , the strain breaks the pseudo - spin symmetry of the dirac point which becomes visible in the spatial resolution of the spectral density . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the formation of an @xmath45-sublattice with increased density at the fermi level ( bright spots ) and a @xmath46-sublattice with reduced density ( dark spots ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( e ) spatial spectral density for single impurity in the plaquette position . ]    next , we consider impurity scattering in molecular graphene . before we proceed , however , we briefly introduce the salient features predicted for impurity scattering in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that simple potential scattering at the position @xmath47 gives rise to a resonance in the local electron dos below the dirac point but within the linear part of the spectrum.@xcite we discuss the results within a nearest neighbor interaction model for graphene of the type @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the pseudo - spinor for creation of electrons in the @xmath45- and @xmath46-sublattice , respectively , @xmath50 is the hopping parameter , @xmath51 is the @xmath52-component of the pauli matrices . in the last term @xmath53 </S>",

    "<S> we can describe scattering from a single vacancy in graphene by letting for example @xmath54 , where @xmath47 is a c site in the @xmath45-sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> this describes scattering off a potential @xmath55 in the @xmath45-sublattice but none in the @xmath46-sublattice .    calculating the resulting electronic structure due to this potential scattering through , for example , a @xmath31-matrix approach , </S>",
    "<S> see refs . for more details , one can write the real space local electron dos in the @xmath46-sublattice as @xmath56 , where @xmath57}. \\label{eq - mgs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath58 is related to the fermi velocity @xmath59 and a high - energy cut - off @xmath60 ev,@xcite @xmath61 is the fermi wave vector , and @xmath62 is a bessel function of the first kind . </S>",
    "<S> the correction @xmath63 displays a clear divergent characteristics for @xmath64 in a spatial neighborhood around the vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the potential scattering creates a resonance within the linear part of the spectrum for large scattering potentials @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is tightly associated with the density in the @xmath46-sublattice , which can be seen since the corresponding electron dos in the @xmath45-sublattice acquires the form @xmath65 $ ] ( for large @xmath55 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the modified density in the @xmath45-sublattice lacks the divergent component . </S>",
    "<S> a three - fold spatial symmetry is therefore expected to emerge for the electron density around the vacancy .    in molecular graphene , </S>",
    "<S> the vacancy defect is realized by adding a scattering center , henceforth referred to as the _ vacancy site _ </S>",
    "<S> , at a point corresponding to a c site in , say , the @xmath45-sublattice , see inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the vacancy site , breaks the _ bond _ between this c site and the adjacent c sites in the @xmath46-sublattice which locally depletes the electron density at this site , in agreement with the expected features around a vacancy site . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( a ) we plot the local electron dos in the lattice sites adjacent to the vacancy site for increasing potential strength . </S>",
    "<S> the potential strength is modulated by varying the number of scattering points comprised in the vacancy site . </S>",
    "<S> the plots illustrate how the resonance builds up within the linear part of the spectrum for increasing number of scattering points in the vacancy site , in agreement with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - mgs ] ) , from a minor hump for the weakest scattering potential ( solid ) to a more pronounced shoulder ( dashed , dash - dotted , dotted ) for the stronger ones . by dividing out the unperturbed electron dos , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( a ) ( faint ) , from the perturbed ones , those features become more apparent , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the plots illustrate the rise of a rather sharp resonance for the strong scattering potentials . </S>",
    "<S> also the topography around the scattering potential is modulated by the increased potential strength , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , which show the spectral density for ( c ) 7 and ( d ) 13 scattering points within the vacancy site . as expected , the vacancy scattering generates a three fold symmetric spatial signature in the @xmath46-sublattice , as well as an increased electron density with increasing potential strength . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of the resonance within the linear part of the spectrum , sometimes referred to as a midgap state , is caused by breaking of the sublattice symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively weak resonance obtained in our computations compared to the prediction made in terms of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - mgs ] ) is reasonable since our finite lattice does not generate the very strong electronic confinement as acquired in proper a two - dimensional structure . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the effective potential at the vacancy site is most likely still in the weak limit , even in the case of 37 scattering points in the vacancy site . </S>",
    "<S> our computations , nevertheless , demonstrate the correct tendency of the resulting electronic density around the vacancy .    </S>",
    "<S> scattering off an impurity at a plaquette position ( inside a hexagon ) can be accounted for by removing one of the scattering sites in the triangular lattice , hence , allowing electron density to fill the void and create a bond across the hexagon through the impurity , see the spectral density plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bright spot signifies the increased electron density at the impurity site , and the associated six - fold symmetry of the spatial signature surrounding it is apparent . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a resonance builds up in both sublattices for strong enough scattering potential since the impurity couples equally strong to both .    in summary , we have studied molecular graphene using a scattering theoretical approach . </S>",
    "<S> molecular graphene is constructed from the redistribution of the electron density constrained by a triangular lattice of scattering centers , dual to the honeycomb lattice . making use of point like scattering potentials </S>",
    "<S> , we find that scattering centers comprising several ( about 7 ) scattering points distributed in a hexagonal shape with diameter between roughly 3 and 6   is sufficient to obtain a v - shaped spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that spatially continuous scattering potentials are not necessary to achieve realistic electronic structures . combining those scattering centers with a moderately sized finite lattice ( @xmath66 scattering centers ) </S>",
    "<S> , we reproduce the results in ref . in very good agreement .    </S>",
    "<S> impurity scattering can be realized by adding or removing scattering centers in the system . </S>",
    "<S> an important finding is that we verify that local defects may give rise to sharp resonances within the v - shaped dos , provided that the scattering potential is sufficiently strong . </S>",
    "<S> this is in good agreement with previous theoretical predictions.@xcite our results suggest that defects of the same species as the surrounding lattice does comprise a scattering potential which is sufficiently strong to generate a resonance in the local dos , which we believe to be the cause for the lack of experimental confirmation of this feature . </S>",
    "<S> entities that correspond to stronger scattering potentials which , thereby , deplete the electron density more efficiently than the surrounding lattice should be accessible to the present experimental state - of - the - art . thus , experimental verification of the theoretical prediction should be within the realms of near future experiments . </S>"
