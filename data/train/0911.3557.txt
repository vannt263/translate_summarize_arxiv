    "we suppose for simplicity that the primaries have equal intensities @xmath3 ( symmetric problem ) , and we always consider all the three centres having positive intensities .",
    "let @xmath4 be the position of the third centre and @xmath5 be its intensity .",
    "we assume @xmath6 to be very small and consider the limit @xmath7 : this means that @xmath6 is a perturbation parameter .",
    "in other words , we make the hypothesis that the conditions are such that we can consider the problem as a one - parameter perturbation of an integrable one : the 2-centre problem .",

    "the configuration space for the motion of a particle in the potential field generated by the centres @xmath11 , is @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the position of the particle on @xmath14 .",
    "then the system has smooth lagrangian function on @xmath15 given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 the lagrangian of the 2-centre problem @xmath18 here we use the newtonian notation for derivatives with respect to time : @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath17 is a smooth function on @xmath8 , while @xmath20 has a newtonian singularity at the point @xmath21 . to simplify notation ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 and @xmath23 the potentials due respectively to the primaries and the third centre @xmath21 , so that @xmath24 the lagrangian and the hamiltonian of the problem have the form @xmath25 with @xmath17 , @xmath26 the lagrangian and hamiltonian of the 2-centre problem @xmath27    for negative values of the energy @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , we prove the existence of chaotic motions passing arbitrarily close to the perturbing centre @xmath21 .",

    "non - integrability has been established by bolotin ( see @xcite ) : he proves that for the @xmath31-centre problem on the plane @xmath0 , with @xmath32 , it does not exist an analytic integral of motion which is non - constant on the energy shell @xmath33 , with @xmath30 . in",

    "in particular , we have analytic non - integrability for the restricted circular many - body problem , in which a particle moves in a rotating plane , under the action of the gravitational attraction of @xmath31 centres fixed on this plane , when @xmath32 .",
    "nevertheless , this generalisation does not add any additional information about the @xmath31-centre problem on a fixed plane , in which case it reduces to the result given in  @xcite .",

    "the case @xmath41 has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the authors study the restricted 3-centre problem on the plane , when the third centre is very far from the other two and consider small negative energies @xmath42 , in the limit @xmath43",
    ". then they have a two - parameter perturbation of the 2-centre problem on the zero - energy level .",
    "they succeed in applying the poincar - melnikov theory , thus proving the existence of chaotic motions .",
    "we too study the case of small negative energies , but our point of view is different , in that the position of the third centre does not go to infinity .",
    "this allows us to study the orbits which undergo close encounters with the perturbing centre @xmath21 .    as in",
    "@xcite the unperturbed system is the 2-centre problem with lagrangian @xmath17 . after the classical regularisation of singularities , obtained by the use of elliptic coordinates @xmath44 and",
    "a reparametrisation of time , the system separates : we have the motion of the standard pendulum for the variable @xmath45 and a two - well potential for @xmath46 , with a hyperbolic equilibrium for @xmath47 .",
    "we are interested in the motions which go very close to the centre @xmath21 , then we consider trajectories of the unperturbed problem that pass through @xmath21 .",
    "the perturbing term of the hamiltonian is not @xmath6-small in the vicinity of a collision with @xmath21 and this results in a lost of control on the stable and unstable manifolds , so that a perturbative study of their intersection is not possible .",
    "anyway , we will see that for @xmath6 small enough a hyperbolic invariant set with chaotic dynamics exists , for a dense set of possible positions of the third centre in @xmath0 . moreover , the obtained trajectories shadow chains of collision orbits through the third centre @xmath21 .",
    "we will apply a general result of bolotin and mackay ( see @xcite ) , valid for lagrangian systems with newtonian singularities on a @xmath48-dimensional riemannian manifold , with @xmath49 : they show that if the singular part of the lagrangian is a perturbing term , then for each chain formed by arcs of the unperturbed problem which start and end at a singular point ( _ collision arcs _ ) , there is a unique orbit with the same energy which shadows it . indeed , after local regularisation of the perturbing singularities , the corresponding equilibria are hyperbolic and , by the use of the strong @xmath50-lemma , shadowing arcs are obtained locally in small neighbourhoods of the singularities .",
    "it is then proved that these arcs can be joined to gain the entire shadowing orbits .",
    "in fact , the latter correspond to nondegenerate critical points of a formal functional defined on small spherical neighbourhoods ( circular in the 2-dimensional case ) of the singularities . this functional can be seen as the energy functional of a frenkel - kontorova model .",
    "there is a correspondence between the equilibrium states of frenkel - kontorova models and the orbits of symplectic twist maps , and in this correspondence nondegeneracy of the equilibrium states of the energy functional corresponds to hyperbolicity , as shown in @xcite . with this approach the existence and hyperbolicity of the shadowing orbits",
    "is proved and , by proper estimates on the mixed second derivatives of the formal functional , it is also derived that the lyapunov exponents of the corresponding poincar map are of order @xmath51(see @xcite ) .",
    "the result of @xcite has been applied by the two authors to the planar circular restricted problem of three bodies , in which a massless particle moves under the gravitational attraction of the other two bodies , the primaries , and the latters are supposed on a circular orbit about their centre of mass .",
    "the second primary is supposed to have small mass @xmath6 .",
    "the result is the existence of periodic and chaotic orbits which undergo consecutive close encounters with the smaller primary and which approach , as @xmath7 , arcs of kepler ellipses around the first primary , starting and ending at collision with the second .",
    "a similar existence result has been obtained also in @xcite by a completely different method .",
    "a direct study of the orbits which have close encounters with the small primary is carried out and the proof in this case is constructive . indeed ,",
    "an approximation of the _ first return map _ , defined on a region of the phase space whose projection is a small circle around the second primary , is explicitly computed .",
    "it is shown that the first return map is _ horseshoe _ like and it allows to conclude about the existence of orbits with consecutive infinite close approaches with the small primary .",
    "a complete numerical study of these orbits is carried out in @xcite .",
    "as previously outlined , in this paper we follow the variational approach of bolotin and mackay applied to the 3-centre problem : in this manner we do nt get an horseshoe map , but we still have a symbolic dynamics on the set of quasi - collision orbits found .    in our case the unperturbed system is simply the 2-centre problem with lagrangian @xmath17 and the perturbing term is given by the potential due to the third centre @xmath21 .",
    "fixed a small negative value of the energy @xmath41 , by the classical regularisation of the 2-centre problem the system separates and we can easily find periodic orbits with energy @xmath42 passing through @xmath21 .",
    "we prove by the implicit function theorem that for almost all the possible positions of the perturbing centre @xmath21 on the plane , these orbits do not collide with the primaries @xmath52 , if @xmath53 is chosen sufficiently small .",
    "then they are periodic orbits of the not - regularised 2-centre problem and we can use them to define a finite set of collision arcs , starting and ending at @xmath21 , and take as collision chains the infinite sequences formed with the chosen arcs .",
    "we can verify that the considered orbits of the unperturbed problem are nondegenerate ( see section  [ bolotin ] for the definition ) and then the theorem of bolotin and mackay can be applied to obtain a hyperbolic invariant set formed by the orbits that shadow the collision chains . finally , taking as alphabet the finite set of collision arcs chosen , a symbolic dynamics",
    "is naturally defined on the set of shadowing orbits by considering the shift on the collision chains .",
    "we can also get easily the positivity of entropy .    in section  [ bolotin ] , we will recall the results of @xcite and @xcite for the case at hand , starting from some basic definitions , and state our main result . in section  [ regular_periodic ] we will perform the classical regularisation of the 2-centre problem and compute the periods of the resulting separated problem .",
    "this will allow us to get infinite classes of periodic orbits with fixed energy @xmath42 , passing through the centre @xmath21 ( section  [ collision ] ) : this is the core of the paper .",
    "the delicate point here is to show that the periodic orbits of the regularised problem previously found do not meet the primaries for any small enough value of the energy . in section  [ degen_dir_change ]",
    "we will verify that these trajectories satisfy the conditions which allow to apply the results of @xcite , @xcite and conclude our proof .",

    "this definition of nondegeneracy is the most natural , but it is quite complicated to be used for verifications in concrete examples .",

    "now consider the two orbits associated with @xmath206 : suppose they pass through the centre @xmath220 at time @xmath426 and that their velocities are @xmath217 , @xmath218 .",
    "they are obviously transverse at the point @xmath220 in the cylinder @xmath110 , because we have chosen @xmath156 small enough to have @xmath219 ( see proposition  [ collisionc ] ) .",
    "we must verify that this transversality is conserved after time reparametrisation and changing from elliptic to cartesian coordinates .",
    "the reparametrisation of time is given by formula ( [ newtime ] ) : it maintains the directions , because the centre @xmath220 is not a primary . as seen in subsection  [ early_coll ] , the passage to cartesian coordinates is given by an invertible matrix @xmath427 ( see ( [ matrixu ] ) ) , then the transversality is conserved .",
    "look now at the other possible elliptic coordinates for @xmath21 : they are @xmath368 , then the possible velocities at this point are the same as the ones at @xmath220 .",
    "it follows that there are no more orbits through @xmath21 that we can consider , for the same values of @xmath393 .",
    "we conclude that there are two transverse directions for the collision arcs starting from @xmath21 . in correspondence of the same values of the parameters",
    "@xmath393 we obtain four collision arcs , divided in pairs of arcs with transverse initial velocities .",
    "finally , we observe that , in correspondence of some fixed values of @xmath393 , if an early collision occurs at @xmath21 , then there is a unique ( up to reverse the direction of motion ) periodic orbit through @xmath21 with transverse autointersection at @xmath21 . indeed , since the passage through the primaries is excluded , the matrix @xmath427 is invertible and we can not have inversion points along the orbit , because @xmath428 .",
    "we summarise the results of this and the preceding subsection in the following    [ transversality ] let @xmath97 be a finite set of positive rationals .",
    "suppose that the centre @xmath21 has elliptic coordinates @xmath429 , where @xmath354 is the dense subset given by corollary  [ dense_c_entire ]",
    ". then , there is @xmath213 such that for each @xmath214 and for each @xmath356 , there are exactly four collision arcs at @xmath21 for the system @xmath67 , associated with the value @xmath206 , which are nondegenerate .",
    "moreover , the four collision arcs divide into two pairs , according to their initial velocities at @xmath21 : any couple is formed by two arcs with opposite initial velocities at @xmath21 , and each arc in one pair has transverse initial velocity to each arc in the other .",
    "@xmath163 +      we re going to conclude the proof of theorem  [ central_result ] .",
    "let @xmath97 be a finite set of positive rationals and @xmath430 as in remark  [ xx_i ] .",
    "the energy of the collision arcs at @xmath21 is given as function of the parameters @xmath431 , @xmath356 , by the relation @xmath432 thanks to the regularity of the function @xmath206 for @xmath279 and to the fact that @xmath433 ( lemma  [ regulara ] ) , to require @xmath156 small enough is equivalent to ask for the absolute value of the energy @xmath42 to be small enough . in particular , if @xmath242 , with @xmath434 sufficiently small , then the energy @xmath435 is a strictly decreasing function of @xmath156 : @xmath436 with @xmath437 , @xmath438 .",
    "it follows that all the previous results can be stated using the energy parameter @xmath42 instead of @xmath156 .",
    "if we choose the energy @xmath41 sufficiently close to zero , then for each @xmath356 , there are four nondegenerate collision arcs of energy @xmath42 through the centre @xmath21 : they are pieces of periodic trajectories on the configuration space @xmath439 .    for @xmath156 fixed , the energy increase with the class @xmath189 ( see proposition  [ a1_respect_q ] ) .",
    "this means that we can not state a general result valid for a fixed energy @xmath42 and any @xmath440 . on the other hand",
    ", we do nt need such a result , because to apply theorem  [ bol - mack ] we only want a finite number of collision arcs .",
    "what is certainly true is that for any finite set of classes @xmath366 of cardinality @xmath441 , we can choose a small enough energy value @xmath41 to form a set of @xmath442 collision arcs of energy @xmath42 , by taking for each @xmath443 the four arcs obtained by our procedure .    by the monotony of the function @xmath444 with respect to @xmath189 and its relation with the energy @xmath42",
    ", we are sure that the arcs with the same energy @xmath42 , but different classes , can not have the same value of @xmath186 . then the velocities @xmath445 can not coincide ( see system  ( [ sys_a ] ) ) .",
    "however , we ca nt state that collision arcs of different classes determine a different set of directions at the point @xmath21 .",
    "what we can certainly assure is that if we fix an arc of class @xmath443 , then for each class @xmath446 , not necessarily different from @xmath189 , we can always choose a pair of arcs of class @xmath447 , which start at @xmath21 with directions transverse to the velocity with which the arc of class @xmath189 has arrived at @xmath21 .",
    "thus , for any fixed sequence @xmath448 , @xmath449 , we can construct infinite collision chains @xmath450 , such that any @xmath451 is a piece of a periodic orbit of the @xmath96-centre problem @xmath67 of class @xmath452 .",
    "the assumptions of theorem  [ bol - mack ] are all satisfied and we can apply this theorem and then theorem  [ bol - mack_hyperb ] to get our main result theorem  [ central_result ] , which is now definitely proved .",
    "@xmath163 +    i wish to thank p.  negrini for having introduced me to the subject .",
    "in this appendix we give a proof of the positivity of the topological entropy of the poincar map for the case at hand .",
    "we do it by computing the exponential growth rate of the number of periodic orbits .    by local uniqueness , if @xmath75 is a periodic collision chain , then the shadowing orbit is also periodic .",
    "we compute for each positive integer @xmath31 the number @xmath453 of periodic collision chains with period @xmath31 and take the limit @xmath454    let @xmath189 be fixed and consider only the collision arcs of class @xmath189 .",
    "they are exactly four , corresponding to the two possible transverse directions at the centre @xmath21 .",
    "we distinguish two cases :    * there are exactly two transverse periodic orbits of the unperturbed problem through @xmath21 ( up to reverse the direction of motion ) , and the arcs are given by the entire periodic orbits ; * there is only one periodic orbit of the unperturbed problem through @xmath21 ( up to reverse the direction of motion ) , with a transverse autointersection at @xmath21 , and the arcs correspond to parts of the periodic orbit between two successive passages through @xmath21 .    in",
    "case i ) , for a sequence @xmath75 to be a collision chain we must have that @xmath455 .",
    "then we can not have periodic orbits with odd period @xmath456 , @xmath457 and @xmath458 for each @xmath457 .",
    "the number of periodic orbits with even period is @xmath459 instead , then @xmath460 .    in case",
    "ii ) , for @xmath75 to be a collision chain , we must have that @xmath461 , because there are only four possible velocities at @xmath21 , divided in two pairs each containing the parallel ones , and any arc @xmath462 arrives at @xmath21 with velocity @xmath463 transverse to the initial one @xmath464",
