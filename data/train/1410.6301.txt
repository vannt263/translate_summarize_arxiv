    "work fluctuation relations link the thermodynamic behavior of a system undergoing a non - equilibrium transformation to its equilibrium properties @xcite .",
    "the most prominent examples of such laws are the jarzynski equality @xcite and crooks relation @xcite .",
    "these relations have been experimentally confirmed in several setups such as colloidal particles @xcite , biological molecules @xcite , defects in diamonds @xcite and electronic nanostructures @xcite .",
    "moreover , these experimental achievements have stimulated a great deal of further theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the typical scenario is the following .",
    "the system under scrutiny is embedded in a thermal environment and driven between two different hamiltonians over a time that is short enough not to allow instantaneous equilibration .",
    "the exponentiated work is then averaged over many repetitions of the same protocol and equilibrium free energy differences can be extracted . in all of these cases a complete identification of the relevant dynamical quantities is required . thus , it is only natural to wonder what kind of non - equilibrium statistics we would observe if such an assumption no longer held true .",
    "this problem has been experimentally addressed @xcite in order to understand how the lack of knowledge of slow degrees of freedom in a non - equilibrium system might modify standard fluctuation relations .",
    "two colloidal particles were forced to interact by switching on and off a static magnetic field and the dynamics of only one particle was tracked . for most of the experimental parameters as well as for small and large values of the entropy production a crooks - type relation @xcite was observed @xmath0=\\alpha\\delta s , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where , however , the slope @xmath1 deviated from unity . + here , we take a different but complementary approach .",
    "first of all , the physical setup we consider is a pair of coupled single - electron boxes ( seb ) @xcite .",
    "these are electronic nano - circuits where single - electron currents can be generated and controlled .",
    "although the basic mechanism inducing such currents is quantum tunneling of single electrons across a junction , we assume our stochastic system to operate in the classical domain .",
    "in other words , no quantum coherences between different electronic states are present at any time .",
    "this regime has been experimentally implemented in a series of recent works @xcite . here",
    "non - equilibrium dynamics has been observed by implementing suitable time - dependent protocols changing some relevant energy parameters , such as voltage .",
    "we investigate two possible scenarios . while the two sebs interact through a time - independent force we drive the single - box energy of either one or both the boxes according to a fixed time - dependent protocol .",
    "we discard completely the dynamics of the other box , say 2 , and calculate the entropy production in box 1 .",
    "the main question we address is the following : how does such an interaction between the two sebs affect the driven dynamics and consequently the non - equilibrium statistics of the single box ?",
    "deviations from the standard behavior are found and , although their extent as well as their nature depend upon the specific details of the driving protocol , a general trend arises . in all of the situations considered",
    "such deviations are non - linear both in the coupling strength and in the entropy production .",
    "thus , they are not explainable with an effective - thermal - environment description for the reduced dynamics and statistics of box 1 .",
    "again , this is a complementary viewpoint to the approach adopted in @xcite as we imagine to drive the free hamiltonian / s of one or both the sebs while the interaction is always present although static .",
    "one can look at this model as the prototype of an incomplete experimental setup where information regarding some degrees of freedom is missing . in this respect",
    ", this study aims at a better understanding of which degrees of freedom and time - scales are truly relevant when it comes to non - equilibrium physics , with particular emphasis on fluctuation relations .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we will introduce and describe our model ; in sec .",
    "[ therm ] we will review some basic facts regarding fluctuation relations ; in sec .  [ single ] and sec .  [ double ] we will present our findings , and the final section will be devoted to conclusions .",
    "we consider two single - electron boxes capacitively interacting with each other , see fig.[fig1]a .",
    "the non - equilibrium thermodynamics of these nano - devices has recently been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "each box consists of two conducting electrodes coupled through a junction with capacitance @xmath2 and biased by a gate voltage @xmath3 applied through a capacitor @xmath4 .",
    "the total system is at thermal equilibrium with the surroundings at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian governing the dynamics reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath8 single - box charging energy , with @xmath9 being the total capacitance , @xmath10 is the number of excess electrons , @xmath11 is the charge of the gate voltage , and @xmath12 $ ] is the intra - box coupling constant . changing the gate voltage of a box causes excess electrons to tunnel across the junction .",
    "the variables @xmath10 are therefore stochastic , integer valued and unbounded . for most of the applications the surrounding temperature can be made small enough to guarantee that @xmath13 . furthermore , if the resistance of each junction @xmath14 is tuned such that @xmath15 , only the two lowest electron states @xmath16 can be effectively populated . with this simplification",
    "only four two - box states need to be accounted for , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 . depending on the value of the seb resistance",
    ", both single and many - electron co - tunneling processes can take place . from now on we will assume only single - electron processes to be relevant .",
    "this means that only the following transitions are to be considered @xmath18 and the energy differences for the corresponding transitions are @xmath19\\\\ & \\delta e_{(0,1)\\leftrightarrow(1,1)}=\\pm[e_{c_{1}}+ j(1-n_{g_{2 } } ) - 2e_{c_{1}}n_{g_{1 } } ] .",

    "we focus on two well - known fluctuation relations .",
    "the first one is the jarzynski equality @xcite .",
    "this links the work @xmath30 performed in a general thermodynamic transformation to equilibrium free energy difference @xmath31 for a system in a single bath .",
    "shortly , the hamiltonian @xmath32 of a system initially at thermal equilibrium is changed in time to a final @xmath33 , for instance by driving one of its parameters according to some protocol .",
    "no assumption regarding the duration of such a protocol is made .",
    "the work performed @xmath30 is recorded . if @xmath34 is the equilibrium free energy difference between the initial and final boltzmann distributions , the following relation holds @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes a statistical average over many repetitions of the same protocol . in the model",
    "utilized here and for all the protocols we consider , the equilibrium free energy difference @xmath31 vanishes exactly .",
    "hence , by using the first law of thermodynamics , the jarzynski relation can be recast in the following form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total entropy production .",
    "the heat dissipated to the bath in a single run of the protocol can be shown to be proportional to the statistical entropy production @xmath38 @xcite @xmath39 , \\label{q}\\ ] ] where a transition associated to the energy gap @xmath24 occurs at time @xmath40 .",
    "we remind that the above expression refers to the total system and to all the possible single - electron transitions that occur in both single - electron boxes .",
    "the second relation we focus on is the fluctuation theorem @xcite @xmath0=\\delta s , \\label{totaltc}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the entropy production probability distribution of the forward ( backward ) transformation .",
    "the question we address is whether ignoring some degrees of freedom may lead to deviations from eqs.- .",
    "we are going to be investigate the statistics of stochastic entropy production @xmath42 in the first box @xmath43 , \\label{entropy1}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 represents the subset of transitions occurring in the first seb only .",
    "the idea is then to investigate the following quantities @xmath45 , \\label{tc1}\\ ] ] @xmath46",
    "in this section we focus on the following scenario . we are given a single - electron box , capacitively coupled to a second box whose existence we are not aware of .",
    "we change the gate voltage @xmath47 of the first seb in time as follows @xmath48 from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , see fig.[fig1]b .",
    "this will force the box to switch from the state @xmath51 to the state @xmath52 .",
    "the gate voltage of the second box is instead constant @xmath27 at all times .",
    "this choice guarantees that @xmath53 . even though the second box is not externally driven , the interaction in eq .",
    "may cause tunneling events in the second box .",
    "thus , contributions from box 2 to the thermodynamics of the total system will arise .",
    "our goal is to investigate whether ignoring such contributions results in a modified version of standard fluctuation relations , such as eqs .  - .",
    "summarizing , the experimental scenario considered here is the following : 1 ) the initial two - box state is described by a boltzmann distribution @xmath54 where @xmath55 is given in eq .  ; 2 ) we change the gate voltage of the first box linearly in time according to eq .   while keeping the gate voltage of the second box at @xmath27 ;",
    "3 ) we generate a trajectory for the joint stochastic variables @xmath56 using monte - carlo jump method ; 4 ) we record the entropy @xmath42 generated in the first box only ; 5 ) based on the outcomes of each single repetition we perform a statistical analysis of eqs .  - ,",
    "but for @xmath42 instead of @xmath38 .",
    "we anticipate that deviations are observed . however , when the statistics of @xmath38 is considered , both eq .   and",
    "eq .   are recovered .      here",
    "we assume the two single - electron boxes to be identical ( @xmath57 ) .",

    ". the temperature will be chosen at @xmath60 , a value used in all the numerical examples here . in a real experimental setup , such as",
    "the one utilized in @xcite , these values would roughly correspond to @xmath61 .",

    "+ figure  [ plot1 ] shows the behavior of @xmath62 as a function of the rescaled interaction strength @xmath63 for two different values of @xmath64 .",
    "the symbols are raw data from numerical simulations while the continuous lines are quadratic fits with a 0.95 statistical confidence level .",
    "we notice a dramatic deviation from unity in the case of long ( @xmath65 ) protocol . generally speaking ,",
    "the exponentiated entropy generated in the first box is an increasing function of the coupling constant . in the case of a short protocol ( @xmath66 ) such behavior",
    "is instead slightly harder to observe , especially for very small values of @xmath63 .",
    "this result can be understood as follows .",
    "when the length of the driving protocol is long as compared to the typical time - scale of the dissipative dynamics , set by @xmath67 , it is more likely for single - electron transitions in the second box to take place .",
    "these can be seen as a response of the second box to tunneling events occurring in the first box",
    ". a slower rate of change @xmath68 will allow the second box to follow the dynamics of the first one and react to it through the interaction term .",
    "a faster rate of change will instead cause the second box to essentially freeze since tunneling events in the first box occur on a much shorter time - scale . in other words ,",
    "only the driven box is responsible for almost all of the entropy generated . obviously , the more transitions in box 2 take place , the more they will contribute to the entropy production of the total system . on the contrary , if the largest contribution to the thermodynamics comes from box 1 only , neglecting box 2 will not influence much and the standard fluctuation relation is approached",

    "the symbols represent the raw numerical values obtained from monte - carlo simulations while the continuous lines are quadratic fittings with a statistical confidence level of 0.95 .",
    "while for @xmath73 we recover the standard fluctuation theorem , stronger deviations for progressively larger values of @xmath72 can be seen .",

    "are harder to observe . even for large values of box 1 entropy production and the strongest coupling considered @xmath74 ,",
    "all the curves appear to depart very little from a line with slope 1 and non - linear contributions are not prominent .",
    "these results are in agreement with fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] and can be understood with the same argument .",
    "both in fig .  [ plot2]a and [ plot2]b we show the probability distributions @xmath75 corresponding to the different values of @xmath76 ( inset ) . while in the case of a slow protocol we observe a smooth , gaussian - type distribution for every value of the coupling , the situation is different in the case of a short drive .",
    "for all the values of the interaction strength , @xmath75 displays one or more peaks .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "when @xmath27 the initial energy of the states @xmath77 is equal , leading to a @xmath78 population probability in the initial thermal distribution @xmath54 for any value of @xmath72 . since in this case the protocol is very fast , often no transitions will occur .",

    "more specifically we change the resistance @xmath88 of the second box relatively to the resistance @xmath89 of the first box . since the transition rates are inversely proportional to the box resistance , by changing the ratio @xmath90 we are changing the typical dissipation time - scale of one box with respect to the other .",
    "we first consider the situation where the resistance of the second seb is smaller , leading to a larger transition rate .",
    "we might expect a behavior that deviates more strongly from eq .   than that displayed in fig .",
    "[ plot2]a . by comparig the insets of fig .",
    "[ plot2]a and fig .",
    "[ plot3]a we notice that in the latter all the distributions @xmath75 are slightly broader , especially on the negative side of the @xmath42-range .",
    "this implies that the probability of observing certain events increases with respect to the case of equal resistances .",
    "since the only difference between the two models is a lower @xmath88 we are led to believe that these contributions stem from transitions in the second box that are more likely to happen even in the case of slow drive .",
    "however , such a difference is not immediate when we look at @xmath91 $ ] , fig .",
    "[ plot3]a . here",
    ", the behavior is rather similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ plot2]a and no appreciable difference can really be noticed .",
    "+ in the second case we instead assume the resistance of the second box to be larger .",
    "this translates to slowing down the second seb with respect to the first one and it means that even for slow drive it should be harder to induce transitions in box 2 through the box - box interaction .",
    "therefore , we might expect less participation of the second box to the total dynamics as well as to the measurement statistics .",
    "figure  [ plot3]b confirms this prediction as , even with @xmath69 , the logarithm of the forward to backward distribution ratio @xmath92 $ ] when the box - box interaction is on , deviates very little from the non - interacting case where we recover eq .  .",
    "thus , increasing the resistance of the second seb is qualitatively similar to implementing a faster protocol .",
    "this can be further seen by direct comparison between the insets of fig .",
    "[ plot2]b and fig .",
    "[ plot3]b .",
    "apart from the presence of no - transition peaks , the two sets of distributions look quite alike . changing the interaction strength does not modify much the shape of the distributions and any deviations can be detected only when taking the logarithm of the forward to backward distribution ratio .",
    "moreover , also in this case a non - linear trend appears only for higher values of @xmath72 .",

    "in this section we repeat the above study but with a different gate operation .",
    "we again assume the two sebs to be at thermal equilibrium with the surrounding bath .",
    "while the first box is still subject to the same drive as in eq .",
    "the second box gate voltage will be changed according to the following protocol @xmath95 see fig .  c. thus ,",
    "the two protocols are antisymmetric with respect to each other and if @xmath96 drives the first box as @xmath97 , @xmath98 will drive the second as @xmath99 .",
    "since we consider identical boxes , the initial and final hamiltonian are formally equal , leading to a vanishing free energy difference @xmath53 . in this scenario extra work on the second box",
    "is performed and not accounted for .",
    "therefore , we can expect modifications of the standard fluctuation relations to be more pronounced .",
    "although both boxes are being simultaneously driven , leading to what may seem more complex dynamics , this particular choice of the total driving protocol results in some simplifications that allow us to perform analytical predictions .",
    "the ground state of the initial hamiltonian is @xmath100 and therefore it is most probable in the initial boltzmann distribution . since the target process",
    "we want to realize is @xmath101 and only single - electron processes are possible , we assume that most of the stochastic trajectories occurring are the following two - step trajectories @xmath102 we call this the single - jump approximation . by analyzing the corresponding transition rates , it is easy to see that such trajectories are equally probable .",
    "the total probability distribution of the entropy generated in the first seb can be split in the two contributions arising from these trajectories @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the probability distribution associated to the @xmath105 trajectory , whose analytical expressions are given in the appendix .",
    "this model will be used in the following for a direct comparison with the numerical results , which we now report and discuss . in fig .",
    "[ plot4 ] we show the the r.h.s . of eq .   for a slow driving protocol with @xmath69 for several values of the box - box coupling parameter .",
    "similarly to the previous cases , we display the values taken directly from simulations as well as their polynomial fittings , this time up to a fifth - order .",
    "again the statistical confidence level is 0.95 .",
    "a new feature we notice is the negativity of @xmath91 $ ] for large coupling strengths and small entropy productions .",
    "what this negativity is telling us is that it is more probable for box 1 to lower its entropy rather than increase it during the execution of the transformation .",
    "this effect increases for increasing values of the magnitude of the interaction strength as indicated by an increase in the range of values for which @xmath42 is negative , up to a certain threshold after which positivity is restored .",
    "although at first this result might appear bizarre and in contrast with the second law of thermodynamics , this is not the case .",
    "in fact , if we compute the average entropy production in box 1 we always find a positive quantity .",
    "given the symmetry of the model , the same goes if we restrict our attention to the second seb . as a matter of fact",
    ", the negativity arises as a consequence of the double - peak distribution shown in the inset . as mentioned above the two trajectories @xmath106 and",
    "@xmath107 occur with equal probability as clearly shown by the equal heights of the peaks in @xmath75 .",
    "however , as soon as we turn the box - box interaction on , they become energetically unequal .",
    "this very asymmetry causes the negativity of @xmath91 $ ] since the sum of the energies corresponding to single - box transitions equals the heat dissipated by the box itself which , in turn , is proportional to the entropy generated .",
    "furthermore , since by increasing @xmath63 we increase the entropy gap between @xmath106 and @xmath107 , a stronger intra - box coupling will display a progressively stronger negativity feature .",
    "+     in the case of a slow drive @xmath65 , for the double - drive protocol .",
    "the values of @xmath63 are the same as in fig .",

    "these results are obtained by statistically averaging over 10 million repetitions . from these data",
    "one can also reconstruct the joint occupation probabilities @xmath20 and check that they converge to the solutions of .",
    "each repetition in the sample represents a single experiment and it is simulated via monte - carlo method with time - dependent transition rates where multiple back - and - forth transition trajectories are possible .",
    "one might then wonder the limits of applicability of the single - jump - trajectory approximation . in fig .",

    "while the single - jump model predicts a constant linear increase , with the monte - carlo method we observe a smooth decrease that appears almost sinusoidal .",
    "this feature is a consequence of multi - jump trajectories .",
    "since the single - jump model only allows for just two electronic transitions during the execution of the whole protocol , it becomes less reliable at higher energies where electrons can tunnel many times back and forth in a single realization .",
