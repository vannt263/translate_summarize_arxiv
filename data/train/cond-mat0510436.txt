    "the numerical investigation of the groundstate properties of a multiparticle interacting bosonic system is a much harder task than in the case of a single particle system .",
    "the naive approach consists in choosing a large enough finite hilbert space basis and the numerical diagonalization of the resulting hamiltonian matrix .",
    "however , the necessary basis size grows exponentially with the number of particles , which makes this simple method inadequate for the treatment of large systems . to avoid this problem ,",
    "many approximations have been invented , such as the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) mean field approach  @xcite , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite or , in the case of strong interactions , the thomas - fermi approximation  @xcite and the tonks - girardeau model  @xcite .",
    "for fermionic systems , the exact diagonalization - ab initio ( edabi ) method has been implemented  @xcite .",
    "one should also note the exceptional case of a full analytical solution in one dimension by lieb and liniger  @xcite . from this solution ,",
    "two- and three - pair correlation functions of an interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose gas have been derived  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a new approach , which is in the flavour of renormalization group methods but is conceptually simple and easy to implement .",
    "our method amends the problem of unmanageable basis size by reducing the number of particles in the system and renormalizing the hamiltonian .",
    "we approximate one- and two - particle properties of the large system with the same properties of the smaller system .",
    "in contrast to mean field methods , our approach allows to calculate such quantities as one- or two - particle reduced density matrices ( 1-rdm and 2-rdm ) of the groundstate .    in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we describe how our method works .",
    "section  [ sec : example ] contains an example application of the method to the problem of one - dimensional interacting bose gas in a harmonic trap .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we present our approximation in the case of a system with two - body interactions .",
    "it can be easily generalized to the general case of @xmath0-body interactions .    consider a 1d hamiltonian describing a system of @xmath1 scalar ( zero spin ) bosons , @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the number of particles , @xmath3 is the particle mass",
    ", @xmath4 is the external one - particle potential and @xmath5 is the two - particle interaction potential .",
    "investigating such a system , we are often interested only in one- or two - particle properties of the groundstate . one way to calculate them is to obtain an approximation of the 1-rdm or 2-rdm of the groundstate .",
    "we approximate the system by replacing it with a much smaller system containing @xmath6 scalar bosons .",
    "the smaller system is governed by a renormalized version of the original hamiltonian @xmath7 , that is @xmath8 \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] we calculate the properties of interest from the groundstate of @xmath9 , thus avoiding the insurmountable problem of diagonalizing the hamiltonian of the large system , @xmath7 .",
    "the results for increasing values of @xmath10 will converge to the values of the corresponding properties of the @xmath1-particle system .",
    "we will now justify our procedure .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be a state of the large system and its @xmath10-rdm , respectively .",
    "it is easy to show that their mean energies , measured by the respective hamiltonians , are equal , @xmath13 hence , when the mean energy of @xmath11 becomes lower , moving closer to the mean energy of the groundstate @xmath14 of @xmath7 , the mean energy of @xmath12 , also becomes lower and moves closer to the mean energy of the ( pure state ) density matrix @xmath15 of the groundstate @xmath16 of @xmath9 . because of the variational principle",
    ", the density matrix @xmath15 is an approximation of the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) @xmath17 of the groundstate @xmath14 .",
    "the one- or two - particle properties of @xmath17 ( i.e. of @xmath14 ) , like the probability density , are approximated by the same properties of @xmath15 ( i.e. of @xmath16 ) . since @xmath6 , it is much easier to calculate numerically the groundstate @xmath16 than the groundstate @xmath14 , and to investigate the one- or two- particle properties of @xmath14 by investigating the same properties of @xmath16 .",
    "the main source of error in our method is the fact that the variational search for the groundstate converges to the @xmath10-particle groundstate @xmath18 , not to the rdm of the @xmath1-particle groundstate , @xmath17 .",
    "this is because for bosons , not every @xmath10-particle density matrix is an rdm of an @xmath1-particle state .",
    "a better strategy would be to perform the variational search not in the whole @xmath10-particle hilbert space but in the smaller space of @xmath10-particle density matrices which are rdms of @xmath1-particle states .",
    "however , the problem of identifying this space , the so - called @xmath1-representability problem  @xcite , remains unsolved .",
    "therefore , we have to perform our calculations for a sequence of @xmath10 .",
    "the energy of the @xmath10-particle groundstate is a lower bound of the energy of the investigated @xmath1-particle groundstate  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath10 increases , the groundstate energy increases and approaches the groundstate energy of the @xmath1-particle groundstate . due to the variational principle , this means that the @xmath10-particle groundstates approximate the @xmath1-particle groundstate increasingly well , in the sense that the one- and two - particle properties calculated from these groundstates converge to the corresponding properties of the @xmath1-particle groundstate .",
    "in the general case of @xmath0-particle interactions , the renormalization goes as follows : an @xmath0-particle interaction potential term @xmath19 , symmetrical with respect to permutations of coordinates @xmath20 , is replaced by the term @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "equation   is true also in this general case .",
    "in our example , we consider a system of @xmath23 scalar bosons with a dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dirac @xmath26 function .",
    "this interaction potential is often used to describe cold bosons forming a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a trap , when only the @xmath27-wave scattering occurs  @xcite .",
    "our example concerns positive @xmath28 , which lead to the repulsive interaction .",
    "we have approximated numerically the 1-rdm and 2-rdm of the groundstate for two values of interaction strength @xmath28 .",
    "the procedure begins with the calculation of a finite matrix of the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath9 in a finite basis composed of the noninteracting hamiltonian ( @xmath29 ) eigenstates , permanents   is the permanent of one - particle wavefunctions @xmath30 and @xmath31 . ] of @xmath10 one - particle hermite functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is @xmath35-th hermite polynomial .",
    "the basis contains all eigenstates with ( nonrenormalized ) energies lower than a cutoff energy @xmath36 , i.e. permanents of functions @xmath37 , @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "then , the groundstate is calculated with the help of an iterative lanczos - type numerical procedure  @xcite . from the groundstate",
    "we obtain the 1-rdm and the 2-rdm , with trace normalized to unity . using them",
    ", we can calculate any one- or two - particle property of the groundstate . for given @xmath10 , the basis cutoff @xmath40 is chosen to be large enough so that calculated properties do not change upon further increase of @xmath40 .",
    "in the case of 1-rdm , @xmath41 , we compare the diagonal part , @xmath42 , with the probability density calculated by minimizing numerically the gp energy functional  @xcite of our system , @xmath43 & = \\frac{n}{2 } \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\biggl [ { { { \\psi}^\\ast}}(x ) \\left ( - \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2 } + x^2 \\right ) \\psi(x)\\\\ & \\quad+ ( n-1 ) \\lambda { \\left|\\psi(x)\\right|}^4 \\biggr ] \\mathrm{d } x \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] the minimization is performed by expanding the wavefunction @xmath44 in the finite basis of the first twenty hermite functions  , inserting the expansion into   and minimizing numerically the resulting functional of the expansion coefficients .",
