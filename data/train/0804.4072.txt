    "neutrino oscillation experiments have demonstrated that neutrinos are massive particles @xcite . with the most recent experimental data by the minos @xcite and kamland @xcite collaborations atmospheric and solar mass - squared differences",
    "are now known very precisely and global fits to all neutrino oscillation data @xcite also give quite accurate determinations for the corresponding neutrino mixing angles .",
    "for the overall mass scale of neutrinos and the third neutrino mixing angle currently only upper limits exist , but considerable progress is expected from future double beta decay @xcite and reactor neutrino oscillation @xcite experiments .",
    "neutrino masses provide the first experimental signal of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . from an experimental point of view",
    ", neutrino oscillation data can easily be fitted in very much the same way as the sm accounts for quark masses and mixings , i.e. namely by dirac neutrino masses . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", however , such an ansatz is _ ad hoc _ since , being electrically neutral , neutrinos are expected to be majorana particles  @xcite . indeed , as noted already in @xcite , the dimension-5 operator , @xmath3 induces _ majorana _ masses for neutrinos once the electroweak symmetry breaks . this way",
    "the smallness of the neutrino masses can then be attributed to the existence of some lepton number violating scale larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "a variety of ways to generate this operator have been suggested .",
    "the resulting majorana neutrino masses can be suppressed either by loop factors , by a large mass scale , by a small scale whose absence enhances the symmetry of theory , or by combinations of these mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "electroweak scale models , such as , for example the zee model  @xcite , the babu - zee model @xcite , supersymmetric models with violation of r - parity @xcite or lepton number violating leptoquark models  @xcite generate neutrino masses at loop - level , resulting in @xmath4 and @xmath5 need not be much larger than @xmath6 .",
    "a similar situation arises in models like the inverse seesaw  @xcite .",
    "such low - scale models have the advantage that the new fields responsible for the generation of neutrino masses may be directly accessible to future accelerator experiments , see for example @xcite .",
    "the most popular mechanism to generate majorana neutrino masses , however , the celebrated seesaw mechanism   @xcite assumes that lepton number is violated at a very large scale , probably at energies comparable to the grand unification scale .",
    "this `` classical '' version of the seesaw mechanism , while automatically suppressing neutrino masses without the need for any small pre - factor , will unfortunately never be directly testable .",
    "however _ indirect _ insight into the high - energy world might become possible , if weak scale supersymmetry is realized in nature .",
    "indeed , starting from flavour diagonal soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms at some high - energy `` unification '' scale , flavour violation appears at lower energies due to the renormalization group running of the soft breaking parameters @xcite . if the ( type - i ) seesaw mechanism is responsible for the observed neutrino masses , the neutrino yukawa couplings leave their imprint in the slepton mass matrices as shown first in @xcite .",
    "flavour off - diagonal entries in the neutrino yukawas then can lead to potentially large lepton flavour violating lepton decays such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath9 conversion in nuclei @xcite . in a similar spirit , if supersymmetry is discovered at a future accelerator such as the lhc , one can use measurements of masses and branching ratios of supersymmetric particles to obtain indirect information on the range of allowed seesaw parameters @xcite .",
    "the most general supersymmetric seesaw mechanism has too many parameters to be predictive and thus can not be excluded by _ any _ measurements of lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) processes . within the supersymmetric version of the seesaw measurements of lfv observables outside the neutrino sector",
    "allow one to obtain valuable independent information about the seesaw parameters @xcite .",
    "there are two logical possibilities of how such lfv measurements might be useful .",
    "( a ) given the current incomplete knowledge on the light neutrino masses and angles , one could make some simplified assumptions about the right - handed neutrino sector .",
    "then `` predictions '' for lfv observables as a function of the remaining unknowns for the left - handed light neutrinos result . or ( b ) one could learn about the parameters of the right - handed neutrinos once the most important , but currently unknown light neutrino observables have been measured .",
    "while the second option might look more interesting , the time scale for making progress on @xmath10 , @xmath11 or the dirac @xmath12 phase @xmath13 will be long .",
    "worse still , the majorana phases of the light neutrinos are unlikely to be ever reliably measured .",
    "hence experimental information most likely will be incomplete and measurements of lfv observables will be useful to at least partially reconstruct the seesaw parameters .",
    "in this paper we study lepton flavour violating decays of the scalar tau as well as lfv lepton decays at low energies .",
    "we assume minimal supergravity ( msugra ) boundary conditions and type - i seesaw as origin of neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "we compare the sensitivities of low - energy and accelerator measurements and study their dependence on the most important unknown parameters .",
    "lfv measurements at accelerators could be argued to be preferable to the low - energy lfv experiments for `` reconstructing '' seesaw parameters , since from a theoretical point of view they involve fewer assumptions .",
    "however , the absolute values of lfv stau decays and , for example , br(@xmath14 ) depend very differently on the unknown susy spectrum .",
    "whether low - energy lfv or lfv at accelerators yields more insight into the seesaw mechanism can currently therefore not be predicted .",
    "while absolute values of lfv observables depend very strongly on the soft susy breaking parameters , it turns out that ratios of lfv branching ratios can be used to eliminate most of the dependence on the unknown spectrum .",
    "i.e. , ratios such as , for example , br(@xmath15)/br(@xmath16 ) are constants ( for fixed neutrino parameters ) over large parts of the supersymmetric parameter space and therefore especially suitable to extract information about the seesaw parameters .",
    "we therefore study such ratios in detail , first in a useful analytical approximation and then within a full numerical calculation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will recall the basic features of the supersymmetric seesaw mechanism , msugra and lfv in the slepton sector .",
    "section [ sec : ana ] then discusses analytical estimates for slepton mixing angles and the corresponding lfv observables . in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] we present our numerical results before concluding in sec .",
    "[ sec : cncl ] .",
    "in order to fix the notation , let us briefly recall the main features of the seesaw mechanism and msugra .",
    "we will consider only the simplest version of the seesaw mechanism here .",
    "it consists in extending the particle content of the minimal supersymmetric standard model by three gauge singlet `` right - handed '' neutrino superfields .",
    "the leptonic part of the superpotential is thus given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the charged lepton and neutrino yukawa couplings , while @xmath20 are the `` right - handed '' neutrino superfields with @xmath21 majorana mass terms of unspecified origin .",
    "since the @xmath20 are singlets , one can always choose a basis in which the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos is diagonal @xmath22 .    note that lfv arises from supersymmetric as well as from gauge boson loop diagrams , for example slepton - gaugino exchange loops and w loops involving right - handed neutrino exchange .",
    "the former ( susy - induced lfv ) can be described by taking a basis where the @xmath18 yukawa coupling matrix is diagonal , its entries fixed by the observed charged lepton masses .",
    "this reduces the relevant physical parameters to a total of 21 .",
    "while in extended schemes like inverse seesaw @xcite gauge - induced lfv is potentially sizeable , it is negligible in the simplest type - i seesaw model , due to the large values of @xmath23 required .",
    "therefore , we focus on such intrinsically supersymmetric lfv , which can be well characterized eq .",
    "( [ su_pot ] ) in the unbroken su(2 ) limit .",
    "different parametrizations for the simplest seesaw have been discussed in the literature .",
    "the most convenient choice for our calculation is to go to the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "we then have as parameters 9 mass eigenstates ( 3 charged leptons , the 3 light and the 3 heavy neutrinos ) .",
    "the remaining 12 parameters can be encoded in two matrices @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with 3 angles and 3 phases each , which diagonalize @xmath19 , @xmath26 the effective mass matrix of the left - handed neutrinos is given in the usual seesaw approximation as @xmath27 if one of the @xmath21 eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath28 goes to infinity ( or the corresponding vector in @xmath19 to zero ) the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath10 ( @xmath29 ) goes to zero . since the neutrino mass matrix is complex symmetric , eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) is diagonalized by  @xcite @xmath30 inverting the seesaw equation , eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , allows one to express @xmath19 as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the diagonal matrix with @xmath29 eigenvalues and @xmath33 in general is a complex orthogonal matrix .",
    "note , that in the special case @xmath34 , @xmath19 contains only `` diagonal '' products @xmath35 .",
    "note that in this approximation the 18 parameters in @xmath19 are reduced to 12 , which are expressed as six light neutrino mixing angles and phases in the lepton mixing matrix @xmath36 , the 3 light neutrino masses in @xmath32 and the 3 heavy `` right - handed '' neutrino masses in @xmath37 .    in the general mssm ,",
    "lfv off - diagonal entries in the slepton mass matrices are free parameters . in order to correlate lfv in the slepton sector with the lfv encoded in @xmath19",
    "one must assume some scheme for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to the case of msugra , characterized by four continuous and one discrete free parameter , usually denoted as @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the common scalar mass , @xmath40 the gaugino mass and @xmath41 the common trilinear parameter , all defined at the grand unification scale , @xmath42 gev .",
    "the remaining two parameters are @xmath43 and the sign of the higgs mixing parameter @xmath44 . for reviews on msugra ,",
    "see , for example @xcite .",
    "calculable lfv entries appear in the slepton mass matrices , due to the nontrivial generation structure of the neutrino yukawa matrix in eq .",
    "( [ su_pot ] ) , as first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "in order to determine their magnitude we solve the complete set of renormalization group equations , given in  @xcite .",
    "it is however useful for a qualitative understanding , to consider first the simple solutions to the renormalization group equations found in the leading log approximation @xcite , given by @xmath45 where only the parts proportional to the neutrino yukawa couplings have been written .",
    "the factor @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 equation  ( [ running ] ) shows that , within the type - i seesaw mechanism the right slepton parameters do not run in the leading - log approximation .",
    "thus , lfv scalar decays should be restricted to the sector of left - sleptons in practice , apart from left - right mixing effects which could show up in the scalar tau sector .",
    "also note that for the trilinear parameters running is suppressed by charged lepton masses .",
    "note also that the lfv slepton mass - squareds involve a different combination of neutrino yukawas and right - handed neutrino masses than the left - handed neutrino masses of eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) .",
    "in fact , since @xmath48 is a hermitian matrix , it obviously contains only nine free parameters  @xcite , the same number of unknowns as on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ynu ] ) , given that in principle all 3 light neutrino masses , 3 mixing angles and 3 @xmath12 phases are potentially measurable . and the dirac @xmath12 phase requires improved neutrino oscillation studies  @xcite and will not be an easy task . even if we are lucky to measure the overall neutrino mass scale in experiments  @xcite , the majorana phases contained in @xmath36 are much harder to determine in practice . ]    in an ideal world where all low energy paramaters , namely the 3 light neutrino masses , 3 mixings and 3 @xmath12 violation parameters were known , the remaining parameters entering eq .",
    "( [ su_pot ] ) could in principle be reconstructed by measuring all entries in @xmath49 .",
    "this would determine the full set of 18 + 3 parameters which , to a good approximation , characterize lfv in the minimal type - i seesaw . in practice , however , there are two obstacles .",
    "( i ) calculability of @xmath50 using eq .",
    "( [ running ] ) assumes implicitly that there are no threshold effects near the unification scale which destroy the strict proportionality to the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "in realistic grand unified theory models this might not be the case . and",
    "( ii ) it is not realistic to assume that all entries in @xmath50 can be measured with sufficient accuracy , since ( a ) the diagonal shifts @xmath51 are very small compared to @xmath52 ( nearly everywhere in the available parameter space ) and ( b ) the determination of the phases require to measure @xmath12-violating lfv observables .",
    "the latter does not seem to be a very realistic option either , since , as our numerical results show , one expects only rather low statistics to be available in measurements of lfv slepton decays .",
    "in this section we present some general formulas describing lepton flavour violation within type - i seesaw schemes .",
    "we concentrate on the discussion of ratios of lfv branching ratios , since , as mentioned in the introduction , these are most easily connected to the seesaw parameters . as a first approximation we adopt the mass insertion approximation , neglecting left - right mixing in the slepton mass matrix and taking the leading - logs ( see below ) .",
    "we will demonstrate the reliability of our analytical estimates in the next section , where we perform a full numerical calculation of the various lfv branching ratios , which does not rely on any of the approximations discussed in this section .",
    "the charged slepton mass matrix is a ( 6,6 ) matrix , containing left and right sleptons .",
    "here we concentrate exclusively on the left - slepton sector . taking into account the discussion given in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] , this is a reasonable first approximation , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ running ] ) .",
    "the left - slepton mass matrix is diagonalized by a matrix @xmath53 , which in general can be written as a product of three euler rotations . however , if the mixing between the different flavour eigenstates is sufficiently small , @xmath54 can be approximated as @xmath55 an approximation that corresponds to that employed in the mass - insertion method  @xcite . in this small - angle approximation",
    "each angle can be estimated by the following simple formula @xmath56 lfv decays are directly proportional to the squares of these mixing angles , for example br@xmath57 if all angles are small .    within msugra ratios of lfv branching ratios",
    "can then be used to minimize the dependence of observables on susy parameters . consider the case of lfv decays which involve only one generation of sleptons , for example br(@xmath58 ) and br(@xmath59 ) . taking the ratio of these two decays @xmath60",
    "i.e. one expects that ( a ) all the unknown susy mass parameters and ( b ) the denominators of eq .",
    "( [ slepang ] ) cancel approximately .",
    "the latter should happen practically everywhere in msugra parameter space since @xmath61 .",
    "this straightforward observation forms the basis for our claim that _ ratios of branching ratios _ are the theoretically cleanest way to learn about the unknown seesaw parameters .",
    "numerically we have found , that relations similar to eq .",
    "( [ mainresult ] ) hold also for ratios of observables involving decaying particles of different generations , such as the low - energy ratio br@xmath62/br@xmath63 .    to calculate estimates for the different ratios of branching ratios",
    "we therefore define @xmath64 where the observable quantity is @xmath65 .",
    "of course , only two of the three possible combinations that can be formed are independent .",
    "for example , br@xmath62/br@xmath66 . here , @xmath67 is a correction factor taking into account the different total widths of the muon and the tau , @xmath68   relate really partial widths , whereas the measured quantity is usually the branching ratio . ] .    in the leading - log approximation",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the charged slepton mass matrix are proportional to @xmath69 . using the parametrization for the yukawa couplings of eq .",
    "( [ ynu ] ) the entries in @xmath70 can be expressed as @xmath71 we can now rewrite eq .",
    "( [ wq : delmgen ] ) in terms of observables which are more directly related to experiments . in the standard parametrization for the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath36 is completely analogous to the ckm matrix and can be written as @xmath72 where we assumed strict unitarity and neglected the majorana phases  @xcite , because they do not affect lepton number conserving processes such as the lfv decays we are concerned with here .",
    "given that neutrino oscillation experiments fix two mass - squared splittings , we can re - express the three light neutrino masses in terms of one overall neutrino mass scale and the measured quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is the solar ( atmospheric ) mass - squared splitting .",
    "we will refer to the case of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) as strict normal ( inverse ) hierarchy .",
    "this choice has the advantage that in both cases @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "equation  ( [ wq : delmgen ] ) can then be written in terms of the measured neutrino angles @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the measured neutrino mass - squared splittings , plus the so far unknown overall neutrino mass scale @xmath10 and the reactor neutrino angle @xmath81 .",
    "if the latter were measured , one could extract information on the right - handed neutrino mass scale and/or the matrix @xmath33 from eq .",
    "( [ wq : delmgen ] ) .",
    "conversely , we could learn about @xmath10 and @xmath11 from measurements of lfv decays , making some assumptions about the scale @xmath28 and the possible textures of the yukawa couplings that determine @xmath28 and @xmath33 .",
    "in this subsection we will assume that the three right - handed neutrinos are degenerate .",
    "this simplifying ansatz allows us to study the sensitivity with a single mass - scale parameter associated with the neutrino mass generation via type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "this ansatz can be theoretically motivated in the framework of some flavour symmetries , for example @xmath82  @xcite . in the special case",
    "that the matrix @xmath33 is real , eq .",
    "( [ wq : delmgen ] ) reduces to @xmath83 where @xmath84 for this degenerate right - handed neutrino ansatz the combination @xmath85 becomes an overall factor , which can be taken out from eq .",

    "let us assume that the lepton mixing matrix has the exact tribimaximal ( tbm ) form  @xcite @xmath87 as is well - known , eq .",
    "( [ tbm ] ) is an excellent first - order approximation to the measured neutrino mixing angles @xcite . with this assumption",
    "the ratios of the off - diagonal elements of the charged slepton mass matrix are simply given by @xmath88 as eq .",

    "we have shown results only for two `` standard '' msugra points . however , as mentioned above , we have checked with a number of other points that _ ratios of branching ratios _ to a good approximation do not depend on the msugra parameters . for absolute values of the branching ratios in general",
    "a heavier slepton spectrum leads to smaller lfv rates at low energy and larger lfv branching ratios at the lhc become possible , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : brs ] .",
    "heavier sleptons , on the other hand , will lead to lower drell - yan production cross section , such that stau production will be dominated by cascade decays , the exact number of events depending on the details of the susy spectrum .",
    "we plan to do a more detailed , quantitative study of absolute event rates over all of msugra space in the future .",
    "we have calculated lepton flavour violating processes both in lfv decays of the @xmath44 and the @xmath254 leptons , as well as branching ratios for lfv stau decays in the supersymmetric version of the minimal type - i seesaw mechanism with msugra boundary conditions .",
    "we have limited ourselves to the study of a few standard msugra points , ratios of lfv branching ratios are independent of this choice and therefore an interesting instrument to study the unknown seesaw parameters .",
    "we have shown that the lfv branching ratios for lepton decays are sensitive functions of the unknown susy spectrum . for light sleptons , the non - observation of br@xmath62 places an important constraint on the observability of lfv stau decays .",
    "the most favorable case is when right - handed neutrinos are hierarchical , with @xmath143 giving the leading contribution to the lfv slepton mixing angles and @xmath11 close to zero . in this case",
    "lfv stau branching ratios may exceed 10% or so , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lvf_m3 ] .",
    "lfv stau branching ratios exceeding the percent level may also occur for hierarchical right - handed neutrinos with @xmath129 or @xmath138 dominance for the sps3 reference point , but not for the sps1a case , see figs .",
    "[ fig : stauslfv_m1 ] and [ fig : lvf_m2 ] .",
    "similarly , for the case of degenerate neutrinos , lfv stau branching ratios can exceed a few percent , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : brsps3 ] , especially for sleptons heavier than @xmath219 gev or so , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : brs ] .",
    "notice that the above results rely crucially on an important simplifying assumption about the right - handed neutrino spectrum .",
    "for example , for degenerate right - handed neutrinos they require that @xmath33 be real , while for hierarchical right - handed neutrinos they hold when @xmath34 .",
    "this simplification allows one to calculate lfv decays of leptons and of the scalar tau as a function of low - energy neutrino parameters",
    ". however the use of this assumption should be critically scrutinized .",
    "we plan to come back to this issue in a future publication .",
    "once an improved experimental determination of @xmath102 and @xmath11 become available from future double beta decay and neutrino oscillation studies at reactor and accelerators , one could start `` learning '' about the right - handed neutrino sector , once the correct susy breaking scheme has been identified and provided that the susy breaking scale is above the lepton number breaking scale .",
