    "the compact object rx  j185635 - 3754 ( walter , wolk , & neuhuser 1996 ; walter & matthews 1997 ) is one of the closest isolated neutron stars to the sun @xcite . because of its relative brightness , its isolated nature , and its apparently thermal spectrum @xcite from x - ray to optical wavelengths , this object affords the opportunity to study the surface emission properties of neutron stars , and to measure its radius .",
    "these are important constraints on the dense matter equation of state and the interior composition of the neutron star .",
    "the angular diameter has been estimated by modeling of the spectral energy distribution ( e.g. , pons et al . 2002 ) , while the distance is inferred from the trigonometric parallax .",
    "@xcite found a parallax of 16.5@xmath02.3 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) , based on three images obtained with the hubble space telescope wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "the implications of the inferred 60  pc distance include a likely origin in the upper scorpius ob association , possibly as a companion to the runaway o star @xmath5  oph , an age of 0.9@xmath110@xmath6 years , and a space velocity of about 100  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the uniform temperature heavy - element atmospheric models of @xcite yield a radiation radius @xmath7 km and a redshift @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the neutron star s mass and radius .",
    "the indicated radii and masses are in the ranges 4.58 km and 0.61.2 m@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the implied radius @xmath10 is smaller than allowed by any reasonable equation of state , including that of self - bound quark matter , unless the mass is less than 0.8 m@xmath11 . in that case",
    "the radius could be matched by self - bound quark matter configurations .",
    "relaxing the assumption of uniform surface temperature , @xcite showed that somewhat larger radii , up to r@xmath12=13  km , are accommodated . the inferred small radius , together with the lack of photospheric features in the x - ray spectrum @xcite and the lack of strong pulsations @xcite , has led to speculation that the object might be a self - bound quark star ( e.g. , xu 2002 ; drake et al . 2002 ) .",
    "@xcite reexamined the wfpc2 images , using a more sophisticated point spread function - fitting technique to measure source positions and improved ( and unpublished ) geometric distortion corrections .",
    "they concluded that the parallax is 7@xmath02  mas , resulting in a distance about twice what @xcite measured .",
    "if true , the observational support for an extremely soft equation of state is removed .",
    "three observations are the minimum required to measure a parallax . since the expected parallax corresponds to a sub - pixel shift in the pc camera ( 45.5  mas pixel@xmath3 ) , we sought and were awarded a fourth observation , which occurred on 2001 march 24 , in order to confirm the parallax .",
    "the fourth wfpc2 image was scheduled near the time of maximum parallactic displacement on march 30 .",
    "the first wfpc2 observation was described by @xcite , and the next two were discussed by walter ( 2001 ) .",
    "the fourth observation is a 7400  second observation consisting of 6 exposures at two dither positions with nominal offsets of 5.5 pixels along each axis .",
    "the nominal pointing position was the same as in all of the other observations .",
    "the f606w filter was used to maximize the number of astrometric comparison stars .",
    "the choice of the same filter and pointing position was designed to minimize differential instrumental distortions .",
    "the particulars of all four observations are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the spectrophotometry has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "we reanalyzed the images obtained at all four epochs , taking into account corrections discussed by @xcite .",
    "we made no attempt to perform absolute astrometry .",
    "all positions are measured with respect to the first epoch ( 1996.7 ) .",
    "the images were re - downloaded from the multimission archive at stsci ( mast ) prior to analysis to ensure that the best instrumental calibrations were applied using the mast on - the - fly - calibration facility .",
    "we employed two independent measurement techniques and three independent analysis techniques , as described below .",
    "the first measurement of the source positions was performed by coadding and median - filtering the data obtained at each dither point , resulting in two images per epoch .",
    "we did not analyze the individual images , primarily because of s / n considerations .",
    "we fitted the positions of the targets in each pair of images , with a 2-dimensional lorentzian function as template ( using the idl mpfit2dpeak function ) .",
    "we corrected the raw y positions for the 34@xmath13 row error , using the prescription in @xcite , and then applied the geometric distortion correction from @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the positions are the formal 1@xmath14 uncertainties of the fit parameters , based on counting statistics in the images . to these uncertainties we added in quadrature an uncertainty of 0.03  pixels to account for systematic effects of non - uniformities in the intra - pixel response .",
    "for the subsequent analysis , we used the same reference objects ( mostly field stars ) as employed in @xcite , except that stars 109 , 121 , 125 and 126 were removed because of difficulties in fitting their positions .    in the second measurement method we used the hstphot software @xcite .",
    "this code fits the point spread functions generated with the tinytim @xcite software .",
    "we fitted all the images from each observation , at both dither positions , simultaneously .",
    "@xcite claims an astrometric accuracy of 0.03 pixels with this software .",
    "the hstphot astrometry corrects for the 34@xmath13 row error , but does not account for the geometric distortions , for which we applied the @xcite correction .",
    "we followed all the processing steps described in the hstphot manual prior to running hstphot .",
    "hstphot confirms that the objects identified as extended in table 2 of @xcite are indeed extended ; all other objects are consistent with point sources .",
    "we did not include the extended objects 104 , 108 , or 109 in this analysis .",
    "we analyzed the measured positions by three independent methods .",
    "the derived proper motions and parallaxes are presented in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "first , we performed full @xmath15 minimizations for the proper motions and parallaxes of the objects in the field , including image offsets , residual rotations from the nominal roll angles , and scale factor changes from the nominal plate scale ( 45.5 mas pixel@xmath3 ) .",
    "this procedure was performed twice , both excluding and including the neutron star in the optimization . in the former case , the proper motion and parallax of the neutron star were obtained using the image offsets , residual rotations and scale factor changes from the other objects .",
    "this distinction was made since the expected proper motion and parallax of the neutron star are much greater than for those expected from the field objects .",
    "as anticipated , we found the parallax and proper motion of the neutron star are slightly smaller in the second analysis .",
    "the results quoted in table  [ tbl-2 ] are from the first analysis .",
    "secondly , we determined the proper motion and parallax of the neutron star independently in the n - s and e - w directions .",
    "we registered the images with the assumption that the mean proper motions and parallaxes of the field stars are negligible .",
    "we rotated the measured positions to an equatorial coordinate frame using the nominal roll angles .",
    "we registered the images by shifting by the median offset in each coordinate .",
    "we iterated the registration , excluding stars whose residual differences are significant at @xmath163@xmath14 significance .",
    "registration using a weighted mean shift produced insignificant differences .",
    "we then determined the deviations from the nominal roll angle and plate scale by minimizing the diffences between the positions at each epoch and those of the first epoch .",
    "after resetting the roll angles and the plate scales , we re - registered the images .",
    "uncertainties in the image registrations are about 0.02 pixels ( 1 mas ) in each coordinate .",
    "we then shifted the measured position of the neutron star by the plate offsets , residual rotations and plate scale changes .",
    "the parallax vector was determined by independent linear regression in both right ascension and declination .",
    "the true parallax is the projection of this vector in the direction of the parallactic motion ( position angle 83@xmath17 ) .    in both",
    "the independent x , y regressions and the full astrometric solution we find that the differences from the nominal rotation ( @xmath18 degrees ) and plate scale ( @xmath19% ) are small but significant .",
    "these affect the determination of the parallax at about the 20% level .      as a safety check , we also determined the proper motions of all objects using the pairs of observations separated by integral years .",
    "the residuals at the half - year intervals are the sum of the parallactic shift and the measurement errors .",
    "we found a residual shifts in right ascension consistent with the parallax of the neutron star determined in the other analyses , but no significant residual shift in declination .",
    "the proper motions and parallaxes determined in this measurement are fully consistent with those in table  [ tbl-2 ] , but with uncertainties about a factor of three larger .",
    "the various techniques yield the same results within the uncertainties , and are presented in table  [ tbl-2 ] . for the subsequent discussion , we use the @xmath20 pc distance obtained with full least squares minimization using the hstphot positions , which have slightly smaller nominal errors than those of the 2d fits .",
    "this result is robust because it is based on 4 observations , two at each apex of the parallactic ellipse .",
    "this parallax is significantly smaller than that published earlier @xcite .",
    "we attribute the difference to the omission of the geometric distortion of the camera , which amount to nearly 4 pixels at the edges of the fields @xcite .",
    "the revised parallax is slightly larger than , but agrees to within errors , with that reported by @xcite .",
    "we examined all the stars in the field for their proper motions and parallaxes .",
    "the mean proper motions in ( x , y ) are ( -1,2)@xmath110@xmath21 mas yr@xmath3 , respectively , and the mean parallax is 4@xmath110@xmath22  mas . this justifies the assumptions used for the image registration in  [ sec - reg ] .",
    "@xcite suggested that rx  j185635 - 3754 had its origin in the upper scorpius ob association .",
    "this conclusion is unaltered by the present analysis .",
    "the proper motion is essentially unchanged from what was originally reported , but the tangential space velocity is revised to @xmath23 km  s@xmath3 . for",
    "assumed radial velocities larger than -150 km  s@xmath3 , the projected path of the neutron star traverses the projected position of the upper scorpius ob association within the last 2 million years .    assuming that the neutron star originated in this association , the distance of closest approach of the neutron star to the center of the association is a function of the assumed radial velocity . for a present distance of 117  pc , the smallest separation of the star from the center of",
    "the association is about @xmath24 pc , which occurs for an assumed radial velocity of -10  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the closest approach occurred in this case about 0.5 million years ago .",
    "this separation is appreciably smaller than the size of the association , extrapolating its present size backwards in time .",
    "if rx  j185635 - 3754 was born in the upper sco association , and its age is 5@xmath110@xmath2 years , it is no longer a viable candidate for the binary companion of the runaway o star @xmath5  oph .",
    "@xcite argue that the pulsar psr j1932 + 1059 is the likely companion .",
    "rx  j185635 - 3754 is either the result of a more recent supernova , or is unrelated to the upper sco association .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite that rx  j185635 - 3754 is , within uncertainties , on the standard cooling curve expected for neutron stars is unaltered by the smaller revised age : the luminosity of the neutron star is also increased .",
    "the estimates quoted in @xcite for the magnetic field strength and spin period of the neutron star , based upon the observation of a bow shock nebula by @xcite and a discussion by @xcite , are revised to @xmath25 g and @xmath26 s.      the most important reason to measure an accurate distance to this neutron star is to constrain its mass and radius .",
    "our measurements indicate that , to a first approximation , these quantities will be approximately twice those estimated by @xcite . for the heavy - element model atmosphere",
    "fits @xcite of the spectral energy distribution of the neutron star , from optical to x - ray wavelengths , the revised mass and radius of rx  j185635 - 3754 are shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "the model atmosphere fits , coupled with the revised distance of 117 pc , constrain both @xmath27 km and the redshift @xmath28 . in turn , the quantities @xmath10 and @xmath9 are constrained to @xmath29 km and @xmath30 m@xmath11 .",
    "these values are permitted by a large number of current equations of state @xcite , including those containing exotic matter such as quarks in their cores . however , these constraints appear to be inconsistent with extremely soft equations of state .    since the analysis by @xcite , new high resolution chandra x - ray spectra have become available .",
    "@xcite find that the chandra x - ray spectra is consistent with a blackbody temperature of 63 ev , and show that there is no evidence for the absorption lines and edges expected from a non - magnetized heavy - element atmosphere .",
    "the hotter temperature requires a smaller angular diameter r@xmath31  km  pc@xmath3  for the x - ray emitting blackbody ( the statement by drake et al .",
    "2002 that the predicted optical flux increases by 10% is incorrect ; the predicted optical flux actually decreases by about a factor of 3 relative to the extrapolation from the rosat blackbody because the inferred angular diameter decreases by nearly a factor of 2 ) .",
    "this implies @xmath32 km , even including a revised , increased distance @xcite . on this basis , together with the featureless spectrum and lack of significant pulsations , @xcite suggested that the object may be a self - bound quark star .",
    "however , as demonstrated by @xcite , and earlier by @xcite and by @xcite , the inferred radius depends critically upon the details of the atmosphere and the spectral energy distribution . comparing the rosat and euve x - ray observations with optical and ultraviolet data",
    ", @xcite showed that the optical and ultraviolet radiation can not originate from the x - ray blackbody ( see figure  [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "either the x - ray emission arises in a hot polar cap , or there is significant modification of the spectral energy distribution from radiative transfer through a stellar atmosphere .",
    "the rosat / euve thermal component has an effective blackbody temperature of 55 ev , so the higher temperature inferred from chandra observations only makes this argument more striking .",
    "if the surface has two different thermal components , we can follow the formalism of @xcite to estimate the true radius .",
    "extrapolation of the 63  ev blackbody fit to the chandra spectrum underpredicts the optical flux by a factor of 6 ( figure  [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "attribution of the optical flux to the cooler part of a two - temperature blackbody surface results in r@xmath12/d @xmath330.18 , or a maximum radiation radius r@xmath34  km at a distance of 117  pc . in reality",
    ", the situation will be more complex than a simple one or two component blackbody .",
    "nevertheless , the atmospheric models of @xcite have the net effect that the spectral emissions from a neutron star behave similarly to that of the two component blackbody model : the total radiating surface area must be substantially larger than a one component blackbody model to reconcile the optical data and x - ray data . on this basis",
    ", we suggest that the chandra data will not dramatically change the conclusions summarized in figure  1 .",
    "we are examining model atmosphere fits to the chandra spectrum as well as to the full multiwavelength spectral energy distribution ( work in progress ) .",
    "@xcite discussed only non - magnetic model atmospheres .",
    "new generations of magnetic model atmospheres are becoming available , and may be able to better reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution , as well as the lack of significant spectral features and pulsations . as we can not yet select which atmospheric model best represents the full spectral energy distribution , the radius inferred from blackbody fits to the x - rays alone represent no more than lower limits to the true radiation radius .",
    "we emphasize in addition that the apparent disagreement between the chandra and rosat spectral fits is troubling , as is a possible disagreement between the chandra and euve fluxes where their responses overlap .",
    "@xcite found that the rosat and euve fluxes were mutually consistent , in comparison",
    ". there may be unresolved calibration issues which affect our ability to determine the radius at the level needed to distinguish various equations of state .",
    "until we understand the full spectral energy distribution , it is premature to infer that the radius is substantially smaller than that expected from a normal neutron star .",
    "this research has been supported by nasa through grants go  074080196a and go 081490197a from the space telescope science institute , by ltsa grant nag57978 , and by the usdoe grant ac02-er-40317 .",
    "we acknowledge stimulating converations with f. zel concerning magnetized neutron star atmospheres , and appreciate ongoing discussions with m. prakash about the implications for nuclear theory .",
