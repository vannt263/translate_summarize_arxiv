    "the qcd critical point is the landmark point on the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the divergence of the correlation length in the vicinity of the critical point leads to the divergence of particle multiplicity fluctuations , which provides an accessible way in experiments to detect the existence of the critical point  @xcite .",
    "the recent bes data of @xmath1 presented large deviations from the poisson baselines at lower collision energies , and non - monotonic behavior at around @xmath5 gev  @xcite , which indicates possible signals for the existence of the qcd critical point .",
    "dynamical models have been built to describe the evolution of bulk matter and the chiral field in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "however , a proper treatment of the freeze - out scheme is lacked . in an earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we introduce a freeze - out scheme to such dynamical models , which includes the critical fluctuations near the critical point .",
    "the main results are summarized in this proceeding .",
    "our calculations are based on the assumption that the distribution of protons emitted from the fireball near the critical point satisfies the static statistics , but with a variable effective mass , which is induced by the interaction between the @xmath6 field and protons .",
    "the fluctuations of the @xmath6 field transfer to the fluctuations of protons mass , leading to the fluctuations of proton distributions .",
    "such critical fluctuations can be expressed by expanding the distribution function of protons to the leading order of @xmath7 , @xmath8where @xmath9 represents the distribution function in equilibrium , @xmath10 is the induced fluctuation term , @xmath11 is the covariant lorentz factor , and g is the coupling constant between @xmath6 field and protons . from this expansion ,",
    "the correlators of proton s distribution function are written as @xmath12 @xmath13 , where the correlators of @xmath6 field are obtained from its probability distribution function with cubic and quartic terms  @xcite @xmath14=&\\exp \\left\\ { -\\omega \\left [ \\sigma \\right ] /t\\right\\ } \\notag \\\\            = & \\exp",

    "besides this , several parameters such as @xmath16 are needed to be input .",
    "we set the critical point close to the chemical freeze - out point at 19.6 gev , and tune these parameters according to the ranges and monotonicity suggested by effective models . for details , one can refer to ref .",

    "fig .  [ cumulant4-ske-0005 ] presents the results of energy dependent cumulants for net protons at different collision energies and within different @xmath2 ranges , together with poisson statistical baselines .",
    "the theoretical results are the sum of thermal fluctuations and critical fluctuations .",
    "our model calculations present the general trends of the cumulants within different @xmath2 ranges , and can roughly describe the @xmath0 data within error bars .",
    "but for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the theoretical calculations deviate from the experimental data which are below the poisson baselines .",
    "this is because the static critical fluctuations provide positive contributions to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a summation with the baselines makes the model calculations deviate further from the experimental data .",
    "this problem could not be solved in the framework of static critical fluctuations .",
    "[ c - ratio ] presents comparison of model calculations with the experimental data of the cumulants ratios , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , within different @xmath2 ranges .",
    "the experimental data can be roughly described by our model calculation , except @xmath19 at lower collision energies within @xmath2 ranges ( 0.4 , 2 ) gev , which is caused by the positive contributions of critical fluctuations for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the experimental cumulants and cumulants ratios also present large enhancements at lower collision energies as the maximum @xmath2 increased from 0.8 to 2 gev , which can not be described by the statistical baselines .",
    "[ momentum ] presents our calculation of the @xmath2 acceptance dependence of critical fluctuations of net protons , which shows that the critical fluctuations increase dramatically as the @xmath2 acceptance enlarged .",
    "this is because at lower collision energies , the net proton multiplicities increase a lot as the increase of the momentum acceptance , as @xmath20 .",
    "an increase of the multiplicities leads to the enhancements of cumulants , even though the correlation length is largely reduced here . at higher collision energies ,",
    "the net proton multiplicities decreases a lot , and the critical fluctuations become negligible .",
    "in this proceeding , we summarized the main results in our earlier paper @xcite , in which a freeze - out scheme near the qcd critical point for dynamical models is introduced .",
    "based on this freeze - out scheme , we can describe the energy dependent data of @xmath0 and @xmath1 within different @xmath2 ranges , and qualitatively describe the momentum acceptance dependent enhancements of cumulants and cumulants ratios at lower collision energies , but always overpredict @xmath3 and @xmath4 . a further study of the dynamical critical fluctuations",
