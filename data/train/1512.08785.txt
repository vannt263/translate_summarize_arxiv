    "the inner product on such 2-columns is defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are local coordinates , @xmath4 and the star stands for hermitian conjugation .",
    "let @xmath5 be a formally self - adjoint first order linear differential operator acting on 2-columns of complex - valued half - densities .",
    "our initial objective will be to examine the geometric content of the operator @xmath5 . in order to pursue this objective",
    "we first need to provide an invariant analytic description of the operator",
    ".    in local coordinates our operator reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are some @xmath10 matrix - functions .",
    "the principal and subprincipal symbols of the operator @xmath5 are defined as @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dual variable ( momentum ) ; see ref .  .",
    "the principal and subprincipal symbols are invariantly defined @xmath10 hermitian matrix - functions on @xmath14 and @xmath0 respectively which uniquely determine the operator @xmath5 .",
    "further on in this paper we assume that the principal symbol of our operator satisfies the following non - degeneracy condition : @xmath15 condition means that the elements of the @xmath16 matrix - function @xmath17 do not vanish simultaneously for any @xmath18 and any nonzero momentum @xmath19 .",
    "observe that the determinant of the principal symbol is a quadratic form in the dual variable ( momentum ) @xmath19 : @xmath20 we interpret the real coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath22 , appearing in formula as components of a ( contravariant ) metric tensor .",
    "the following result was established in ref .  .",
    "[ lemma about lorentzian metric ] our metric is lorentzian , i.e.  it has three positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue .",
    "furthermore , the principal symbol of our operator defines an orthonormal frame @xmath23 . here",
    "the latin index @xmath24 enumerates the vector fields , the greek index @xmath8 enumerates the components of a given vector @xmath25 and orthonormality is understood in the lorentzian sense : @xmath26    the orthonormal frame is recovered from the principal symbol as follows . decomposing the principal symbol with respect to the standard basis @xmath27 in the real vector space of @xmath16 hermitian matrices",
    ", we get @xmath28 .",
    "each coefficient @xmath29 is linear in momentum @xmath19 , so @xmath30 .",
    "the existence of an orthonormal frame implies that our manifold @xmath0 is parallelizable .",
    "we see that our analytic non - degeneracy condition has far reaching geometric consequences .",
    "let us consider the action ( variational functional ) @xmath31 associated with our operator . take an arbitrary smooth matrix - function @xmath32 and consider the following transformation of our 2-column of unknowns :",
    "@xmath33 we interpret as a gauge transformation because we are looking here at a change of basis in our vector space of unknowns @xmath1 .",
    "the transformation of the 2-column @xmath34 induces the following transformation of the action : @xmath35 .",
    "this means that our @xmath16 differential operator @xmath5 experiences the transformation @xmath36 this section is dedicated to the analysis of the transformation .",
    "we chose to restrict our analysis to matrix - functions @xmath37 of determinant one , see formula , because we want to preserve our lorentzian metric defined in accordance with formula .",
    "in non - relativistic theory one normally looks at the transformation @xmath38 rather than at .",
    "the reason we chose to go along with is that we are thinking in terms of actions and corresponding euler ",
    "lagrange equations rather than operators as such .",
    "we believe that this point of view makes more sense in the relativistic setting .",
    "if one were consistent in promoting such a point of view , then one would have had to deal with actions throughout the paper rather than with operators .",
    "we did not adopt this ` consistent ' approach because this would have made the paper difficult to read .",
    "therefore , throughout the paper we use the concept of an operator , having in mind that we are really interested in the action and corresponding euler  lagrange equation .    the transformations and coincide if the matrix - function @xmath37 is special unitary .",
    "applying special unitary transformations is natural in the non - relativistic 3-dimensional setting when dealing with an elliptic system , see ref .  , but in the relativistic 4-dimensional setting when dealing with a hyperbolic system special unitary transformations are too restrictive .",
    "the transformation of the differential operator @xmath5 induces the following transformations of its principal and subprincipal symbols : @xmath39 @xmath40 comparing formulae and we see that , unlike the principal symbol , the subprincipal symbol does not transform in a covariant fashion due to the appearance of terms with the gradient of the matrix - function @xmath37 .",
    "it turns out that one can overcome the non - covariance in by introducing the _ covariant subprincipal symbol _",
    "@xmath41 in accordance with formula @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the generalised poisson bracket on matrix - functions and @xmath44 is the operator of matrix adjugation @xmath45 from elementary linear algebra .    the following result was established in ref .  .",
    "[ lemma about covariant subprincipal symbol ] the transformation of the differential operator induces the transformation @xmath46 of its covariant subprincipal symbol .    comparing formulae and we see that the standard subprincipal symbol and covariant subprincipal symbol have the same structure",
    ", only the covariant subprincipal symbol has a second correction term designed to ` take care ' of special linear transformations in the vector space of unknowns @xmath1 .",
    "the standard subprincipal symbol is invariant under changes of local coordinates ( its elements behave as scalars ) , whereas the covariant subprincipal symbol   retains this feature but gains an extra @xmath47 covariance property . in other words ,",
    "the covariant subprincipal symbol behaves ` nicely ' under a wider group of transformations .",
    "the covariant subprincipal symbol can be uniquely represented in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is some real - valued covector field .",
    "we interpret this covector field as the electromagnetic covector potential .",
    "lemma  [ lemma about covariant subprincipal symbol ] and formulae and tell us that the electromagnetic covector potential is invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "the adjugate of a formally self - adjoint non - degenerate first order @xmath16 linear differential operator @xmath5 is the formally self - adjoint non - degenerate first order @xmath16 linear differential operator @xmath50 whose principal and covariant subprincipal symbols are matrix adjugates of those of the operator @xmath5 .",
    "we denote matrix adjugation by @xmath44 , see formula , and operator adjugation by @xmath51 .",
    "of course , the coefficients of the adjugate operator can be written down explicitly in local coordinates via the coefficients of the original operator , see ref .   for details .",
    "applying the analysis from sections [ lorentzian metric and orthonormal frame][electromagnetic covector potential ] to the differential operator @xmath50 it is easy to see that the metric and electromagnetic covector potential encoded within the operator @xmath50 are the same as in the original operator @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the metric and electromagnetic covector potential are invariant under operator adjugation .",
    "it also easy to see that @xmath52 , so operator adjugation is an involution .",
    "we define the dirac operator as the differential operator @xmath53 acting on 4-columns @xmath54 of complex - valued half - densities . here",

    "our main result is the following theorem established in ref .  .",
    "[ main theorem ] the two operators , our analytically defined dirac operator and geometrically defined dirac operator @xmath59 , are related by the formula @xmath60 @xmath61 formula implies that the solutions of equations and differ only by a prescribed scaling factor : @xmath62 .",
    "this means that for all practical purposes equations and are equivalent .",
    "let us consider all possible formally self - adjoint non - degenerate first order @xmath16 linear differential operators @xmath5 corresponding , in the sense of formula , to the prescribed lorentzian metric . in this section",
    "our aim is to classify all such operators  @xmath5 .",
    "let us fix a reference operator @xmath63 and let @xmath64 be the corresponding orthonormal frame ( see section  [ lorentzian metric and orthonormal frame ] ) .",
    "let @xmath5 be another operator and let @xmath25 be the corresponding orthonormal frame .",
    "we define the following two real - valued scalar fields @xmath65 observe that these scalar fields do not vanish ; in fact , @xmath66 can take only two values , @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "this observation gives us a primary classification of operators @xmath5 into four classes determined by the signs of @xmath66 and @xmath69 .",
    "the four classes correspond to the four connected components of the lorentz group .",
    "note that @xmath70 which means that by applying the transformations @xmath71 and @xmath72 to a given operator @xmath5 one can reach all four classes of our primary classification .",
    "further on we work with operators @xmath5 such that @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we say that the operators @xmath5 and @xmath75 are equivalent if there exists a smooth matrix - function such that @xmath76 .",
    "the equivalence classes of operators obtained this way are called _",
    "spin structures_.    the above 4-dimensional lorentzian definition of spin structure is an extension of the 3-dimensional riemannian definition from ref .  .",
    "the difference is that we have now dropped the condition @xmath77 , replaced the ellipticity condition by the weaker non - degeneracy condition and extended our group of transformations from special unitary to special linear .",
    "one would hope that for a connected lorentzian 4-manifold admitting a global orthonormal frame ( see for definition of orthonormality ) our analytic definition of spin structure would be equivalent to the traditional geometric one .",
    "unfortunately , we do not currently have a rigorous proof of equivalence in the 4-dimensional lorentzian setting .",
