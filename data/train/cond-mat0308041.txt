    "in recent years theoretical and experimental investigation of quantum transport through small superconducting hetero - structures has increased significantly ( see for example refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "these structures vary from length scales of the order of a micrometer down to the atomic scale .",
    "experimental progress is driven in part by the development of atomic - scale break junctions , sub - micron- to nano - scale lithography and the fabrication of novel multi - terminal mesoscopic structures , as well as experimental techniques and methods of measuring the local temperatures in small mesoscopic structures.@xcite    considerable effort has gone into the study of charge transport in mesoscopic devices , both the non - dissipative superconducting response as well as the dissipative current response in voltage - biased junctions.@xcite much less is known about the electronic heat transport in temperature - biased junctions . here",
    "we provide a detailed report of theoretical results on thermal transport in small temperature- and phase - biased josephson junctions and weak - links as a function of barrier transparency , @xmath2 , temperature , @xmath3 , and phase bias , @xmath4 .",
    "we provide a derivation of the transport properties of superconducting point contacts starting from the keldysh formulation of the nonequilibrium transport equations for the quasiclassical green functions , and extend our brief report in ref .   of the thermal conductance ( linear response ) to the non - linear current response .",
    "we use the ricatti formulation of the transport equations and follow closely the notation in refs . .",
    "small josephson junctions are ideal systems for investigating quantum effects on transport under well defined non - equilibrium situations . here",
    "we focus on non - equilibrium transport induced by a temperature bias @xmath5 across the junction .",
    "the thermal current is shown to depend on the phase difference , @xmath4 , across the junction . to quasiclassical accuracy ,",
    "i.e. to leading order in the small parameters @xmath6 , the thermo - power is generally negligible , and in this limit there is no temperature - induced voltage across the junction .",
    "the phase remains constant , and thus the temperature - biased junction is in a stationary state .",
    "but , in general the thermo - power is non - zero , so to be more precise we estimate the relative magnitude of the dissipative charge current to thermal current induced by the temperature bias to be of order @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the relevant particle - hole asymmetry parameter . in a closed circuit particle - hole asymmetry",
    "leads to a temperature - induced voltage of order @xmath9 .",
    "thus , for measurements of the heat current on a timescale @xmath10 , the phase is constant and we may consider the thermal current response in a stationary situation .",
    "this is in contrast to the dissipative charge current for a voltage - biased junction , where the voltage is generally so large that the a.c .",
    "josephson effect develops .",
    "the charge current is then composed of a phase - independent d.c .",
    "current and the a.c .",
    "josephson current which oscillates with frequencies @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the josephson frequency and @xmath13 is an integer number.@xcite thus , the temperature - biased junction opens up the possibility of studying quasi - stationary , phase - dependent non - equilibrium transport processes .    at a junction between two superconductors , there are in general bound states in the quantum well formed between the superconducting order parameters on the two sides.@xcite in a clean system , without normal backscattering at the junction ( @xmath14 ) , the formation of andreev bound states ( abs ) can be understood in simple terms by considering a quasiclassical path : a closed path involving one electron - leg and one hole - leg , the two legs connected by andreev reflections at the two sides .",
    "since the superconducting phase is encoded in the coherence factor during andreev reflection , the resulting bound state energies depend on the phase . for contacts in which the distance between the electrodes is small compared to the coherence length ,",
    "there is only one pair of bound states , with energies that disperse with the phase as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the transparency of the interface barrier . since an electric charge @xmath17 is transferred during andreev reflection ,",
    "the bound states participate in charge transport .",
    "in fact the phase dispersion determines the electric supercurrent - phase dependence through the relation @xmath18 .",
    "the continuum quasiparticle states do not contribute to the charge current ; the bound states determine the current - phase characteristics .",
    "the situation is quite different when we consider heat transport .",
    "as is well known , andreev reflection@xcite results in strong suppression of the heat current through a normal - superconducting ( ns ) interface ; an electron and a retro - reflected hole have equal , but oppositely directed , probability currents .",
    "thus , only a fraction of the continuum quasiparticle states above the gap which are not retro - reflected contribute to the heat current across an ns interface . for two superconductors coupled by a point - contact weaklink ( scs )",
    "the local excitation spectrum near the contact plays a central role in regulating the heat current through the interface .",
    "although the continuum states above the gap carry the heat , the transmission probability of these excitations is strongly influenced by an interface andreev bound state ( abs ) at the point contact .",
    "since the binding energy and spectral weight of the abs are controlled by the relative phase of the two superconductors , the transmission probability and the resulting heat current are also phase dependent . for high transmission barriers the reduction of the continuum density of states by the formation of the abs for @xmath19 leads to a suppression of the heat current compared to the case with @xmath1 . for lower transmission barriers @xmath20 and @xmath21 , resonant transmission of quasiparticles with energies just above",
    "the gap leads to an increase in the heat transport relative to the normal state at @xmath22 , over a wide temperature region below @xmath22.@xcite in this paper we investigate this resonance effect and the heat current in detail , including the dependence of the heat transport on the relative phase , the barrier transparency , the barrier model , impurity scattering , as well as the sensitivity of the heat transport to a finite temperature bias @xmath5 , i.e. beyond the linear response limit for the conductance .",

    "[ fig : geometry ] ) is characterized by a transmission probability , @xmath25 for normal - state quasiparticles with fermi momentum @xmath37 incident on the interface .",
    "the reflection probabilty is given by @xmath38 .",

    "we develop the theory for heat conduction for arbitrary transparency of the constriction : @xmath44 .",
    "this theory describes a variety of josephson weak links , including the tunnel junction ( @xmath45 ) and the pin - hole point contact ( @xmath46 ) .    for the order parameters of the two superconductors , we restrict ourselves to the singlet pairing case , but keep the orbital symmetry arbitrary .",
    "thus , the order parameter is in general assumed to be of the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the second pauli matrix in spin space and @xmath49 is the momentum dependent gap amplitude .",
    "the results reported below for the heat transport are for low-@xmath22 superconductors with isotropic order parameters . however , the formalism is applicable to a broader range of josephson contacts , including anisotropic or unconventional spin - singlet pairing states .",
    "we note that current conservation is only guaranteed if the propagators and self - energies ( order parameter , impurity self - energy , etc . )",
    "are calculated self - consistently . in the point - contact geometry",
    "we can neglect the back - action of the current on the self - energies to lowest order in the small parameter @xmath50.@xcite    the electrical and thermal resistances of the junction , both @xmath51 , are much larger than the corresponding resistances of the leads .",
    "thus , the phase change , as well as the temperature change , occur essentially at the junction .",
    "we then take the local phases and temperatures near the contact to be equal to the reservoir phases and temperatures .",
    "thus , we write the order parameters as @xmath52 and @xmath53 in superconductor @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . here are the local temperatures near the contact given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
