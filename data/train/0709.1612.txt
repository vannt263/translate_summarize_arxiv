    "2003 ) is an interacting double galaxy system where the two components are separated by @xmath78(@xmath72 kpc ) .",
    "visually the most notable feature of the system are the thin antennae extending up to 5(@xmath7350 kpc ) , far longer than similar feature of the antennae galaxy ( @xmath7100 kpc ) .    the starburst activity powering the total infrared luminosity of @xmath12 l@xmath13/l@xmath14 ( duc , mirabel & maza 1997 ) in the system has been triggered by a 3 : 1 mass ratio encounter ( dasyra et al .  2006 ) .",
    "the northern nucleus is less luminous than the southern nucleus in the infrared , and is believed to be in a post - starburst stage ( e.g.  berta et al .",
    "2003 ) , while the southern galaxy is a starburst with an embedded agn .",
    "berta et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found the spectrophotometric characteristics of the southern nuclei to be mostly consistent with two main stellar populations : an intermediate aged ( 1gy ) starburst , which represents @xmath735 percent of the luminous mass of the galaxy and an old 12gy population representing the remaining @xmath765 percent of the total luminous mass .",
    "in addition , the southern nucleus has an intense ongoing starburst , which contributes little to the total luminous mass .",
    "the evidence for the presence of an agn comes from the optical emission line ratios ( mirabel , lutz & maza 1991 ) , ir coronal - emission lines ( vanzi et al .",
    "2002 ) , observations of a hard , flat x - ray component above 2 kev ( pappa , georgantopoulos & stewart 2000 ) , and strong fe k@xmath3 emission lines ( braito et al .",
    "2003 ) interpreted as a compton - thick x - ray source . like in other lirgs / ulirgs",
    ", a long - standing question has been whether the spectral energy distribution of the southern galaxy is dominated by the starburst or the agn .",
    "the mid - ir spectroscopic diagnostics are intermediate between those for starbursts and agn ( genzel et al",
    ".  1998 ) .",
    "recently , charmandaris et al .  ( 2002 ) and risaliti et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2006 ) claimed the agn is the main energy source in the southern galaxy based on mid - ir iso and deep @xmath15-band ground - based spectroscopy , respectively .",
    "based on the integral field spectroscopic data obtained with vlt / sinfoni on the southern galaxy , we discuss the nuclear spectrum , excitation of molecular h@xmath5 emission lines and the morphology and kinemetric properties of ionized and molecular gas .",
    "in addition to the high - excitation emission lines requiring the presence of either strong ionising continuum or fast shocks with @xmath16 km s@xmath11 or greater ( contini & viegas 2001 ) , other agn indicators in near - ir wavelength range covered in this work are the variability of the emission lines and non - stellar continuum . considering the distance and brightness of the super - antennae , supernovae and their subsequent evolution are unlikely to produce detectable spectroscopic variability at the nucleus .",
    "the dominant excitation mechanism for h@xmath5 has been under debate for years , the two main candidates being uv fluorescence ( e.g.  black & van  dishoeck 1987 ; sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ) and shocks ( e.g.  hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) .",
    "the interpretation of h@xmath5 line ratios is complicated due to the strong dependence of line ratios on density ; the energy levels are thermalised through inter - molecule collisions and the line ratios in dense clouds illuminated by intense uv radiation are very similar to those from purely thermal excitation , either through shocks or x - rays .",
    "furthermore the h@xmath5 line ratios are affected by the spin degeneracy of the levels .",
    "radiative decay between ortho ( odd @xmath17 ) and para ( even @xmath17 ) is not possible due to different spin and in the ground electric state only @xmath18 = 0 , @xmath192 transitions are possible . for purely thermal excitation",
    "the ratio between the ortho and para levels is 3.0 , but is lower for fluorescence in tenuous gas ( @xmath71.9 using the 10 s(1 ) , s(2 ) and s(3 ) transitions ; black & van  dishoeck 1987 ) .",
    "as the super - antennae is an interacting system , the kinematics is expected to be more complex than in the case of non - interacting galaxies . in the literature",
    "multiple gaussian have been used to approximate optical emission lines ( vanzi et al .",
    "2002 ; colina , lipari & macchetto 1991 ) . interpretating the results of multi - gaussian fits in a physically meaningful manner is however non - trivial , unless the components are clearly separated from each other .",
    "a more qualitative approach for tracing multiple velocity components is using the gauss - hermite series to describe the line profile ( van der marel & franx 1993 ; gerhard 1993 ) .",
    "strong kinematical components can also be revealed by fitting a warped disc model to the observed velocities .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the observations and data reduction are described . in section 3",
    "the results are presented and in section 4 we summarise the conclusions of the work .",

    "this engineering grade detector had two significant defects : a `` glowcenter '' at 2.38@xmath6 m and a large dead region at @xmath232.4@xmath6 m .",
    "unfortunately these artifacts compromised the data quality at the nucleus .",
    "the 250 mas pixel scale was used during the observations without adaptive optics providing a field of view ( f.o.v ) of 8@xmath248 .",
    "the total integration time was 14000  s in @xmath1 and 1800  s in @xmath0-band .",
    "the average @xmath25-band seeing measured by the differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) during the observations was 094 and 077 during the @xmath1-band and @xmath0-band observations , respectively , and the conditions were non - photometric .",
    "the observations were done following the classical osso sequence of alternating object and sky exposures .",
    "the data reduction was done with the _ spred _ software package ( schreiber at al .",
    "2004 ) developed at the max planck institut fr extraterrestrische physik .",
    "the data were bad pixel and distortion corrected and sky subtracted using the nearest sky exposure .",
    "instrumental flexure was tracked by cross - correlating the night sky oh emission lines before sky subtraction , and wavelength calibration was done by fitting a quadratic polynomial to ne arc lamp frames for the @xmath1-band and xe+ar frames the @xmath0-band . due to unstable conditions during the observations , the night sky emission lines and thermal background at the red end of the @xmath1 band were not perfectly removed .",
    "this residual background was removed by calculating a median value along the edges of the cubes at each spectral plane and subtracting it .",
    "while this subtraction unavoidably removes faint continuum emission from the galaxy , the emission lines are unaffected as not even pa@xmath3 can be detected this far out and is not present in the subtracted spectra .",
    "the relative wavelength shifts caused by the instrumental flexure between different exposures were determined by cross - correlation after collapsing the reconstructed data cubes .",
    "the cubes were combined and divided by the telluric standard spectra ( hip099481 ; b9.5v class star ) in order to remove atmospheric signatures .",
    "finally , the flux calibration was done by comparison with broad - band images ( vanzi et al .",
    "we estimate the absolute flux calibration is accurate to within 510 percent .    in order to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio of the images the data were smoothed with a 3 pixel @xmath24 3 pixel boxcar ( 038 @xmath24 038 ) , which is much smaller than the resolution of the data .",
    "emission line measurements were done automatically with scripts written by us for iraf .",
    "if a detected line was significantly narrower than the instrumental profile , it was subtracted from the spectra and the fit was repeated .",
    "finally , the detections were inspected and all obviously wrong fits due to cosmic ray residuals or noise were rejected . in the case of pa@xmath3 , which has multiple components that are difficult to fit automatically , the fit was carried over interactively within the central region . in all the images shown in later sections the lowest level displayed is at 2.5@xmath26 unless otherwise stated .",

    "in addition to pa@xmath3 fortuitously located at an atmospherically relatively clean region at @xmath72@xmath6 m , the @xmath1-band spectrum shows many prominent molecular h@xmath5 lines , hydrogen recombination lines br@xmath27 and br@xmath28 and 2.058@xmath6 m .",
    "a careful study reveals also two coronal lines - 1.962@xmath6 m and 2.04@xmath6 m ( redshifted to 2.0833@xmath6 m and 2.166@xmath6 m , respectively ) .",

    "( 2002 ) , the hydrogen recombination lines br@xmath27 and br@xmath28 are much weaker relative to h@xmath5 lines .",
    "as the h@xmath5 lines are unlikely to change in time scales of a few years , this variability in line ratios strongly suggests large fraction of the hydrogen recombination line luminosity in near - ir is due to agn illuminated gas in nlr .",
    "the h@xmath5 emission line fluxes are higher by @xmath740 percent than those reported by vanzi et al . however , as discussed above , we were forced to use the broad - band images of vanzi et al .  for flux calibration , and it is possible that this difference can at least partly be attributed to changes in continuum brightness .",
