    "long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are originated from cosmological distances ( metzger et al .",
    "their births follow the star formation history of the universe ( e.g. totani 1997 ; paczynski 1998 ; bromm & loeb 2002 ; lin et al .",
    "grbs therefore promise to serve as a new probe of cosmology and galaxy evolution ( e.g. , djorgovski et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it is well known that type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are a perfect standard candle to measure the local universe up to a redshift of @xmath31 ( e.g. , riees et al . 2004 ) .",
    "gamma - ray photons ( with energy from tens of kev to several mev ) from grbs are almost immune to dust extinction",
    ". they should be detectable out to a very high redshift ( lamb & reichart 2000 ; ciardi & loeb 2000 ; gou et al .",
    "hence , grbs are potentially a more promising ruler than sne ia at higher redshifts .",
    "this issue has attracted much attention in grb community .",
    "frail et al . ( 2001 ) found that the geometrically - corrected gamma - ray energy @xmath32 for long grbs is narrowly clustered around @xmath33 ergs , suggesting that grbs can be potentially a standard candle .",
    "a refined analysis by bloom , frail , & kulkarni ( 2003a ) suggests that @xmath32 is clustered at @xmath34 ergs , but the dispersion of @xmath32 is too large for the purpose of constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "schaefer ( 2003 ) considered two other luminosity indicators proposed earlier , i.e. the variability ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ; reichart et al . 2001 ) and the spectral lag ( norris , marani , & bonnell 2000 ) , for nine grbs with known redshifts , and pose an upper limit of @xmath35 ( @xmath14 ) for a flat universe .",
    "using 12 _ bepposax _ bursts , amati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found a relationship between the isotropic - equivalent energy radiated during the prompt phase ( @xmath36 ) and rest frame peak energy in the grb spectrum ( @xmath37 ) , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "this relation was confirmed and extended to x - ray flashes by hete-2 observations ( sakamoto et al .",
    "2004a ; lamb et al .",
    "in addition , it also exists in the batse bursts ( lloyd et al . 2000 ) , and even in different pulses within a single grb ( liang , dai & wu 2004 ) .",
    "possible theoretical explanations of this correlation have been proposed ( zhang & mszros 2002a ; dai & lu 2002 ; yamazaki , ioka , & nakamura 2004 ; eichler & levinson 2004 ; rees & mszros 2005 ) . because of a large dispersion , this relationship is not tight enough to serve a standard candle for precision cosmology , either .",
    "ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004a ) found a tighter correlation between grb jet energy and @xmath39 , which reads @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the jet opening angle inferred from the `` jet '' break time imprinted in the light curves ( usually in the optical band , and in some cases in the x - ray and the radio bands ) by assuming a uniform top - hat jet configuration .",
    "it is puzzling from the theoretical point of view how a global geometric quantity ( jet angle ) would conspire with @xmath43 to affect @xmath29 .",
    "nonetheless , the correlation has a very small scatter which is arguably fine enough to study cosmology . by assuming that the correlation is intrinsic , dai , liang , & xu ( 2004 ) constrained the mass content of the universe to be @xmath44 in the case of a flat universe with a sample of 14 grbs .",
    "they also constrained the dark matter equation - of - state parameter in the range of @xmath45 at @xmath14 level .",
    "ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2004b ) evaluated the goodness of this relationship in different cosmologies by exploring the full cosmological parameter space and came up with similar conclusions .",
    "friedmann & bloom ( 2005 ) suggested that this relationship is only marginal but not adequate enough for a precision cosmology study .",
    "the main criticisms are related to several assumptions involved in the current ghirlanda - relation , such as constant medium density ( which could vary in different bursts , e.g. panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) , constant radiative efficiency ( which also varies from burst to burst , e.g. lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ; bloom et al . 2003a and references therein ) , and the assumption of the top - hat jet configuration ( in principle jets are possibly structured , rossi et al . 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2002b ) .",
    "nonetheless , the ghirlanda - relation has motivated much work on measuring cosmology with grbs ( e.g. firmani et al .",
    "2005 ; qin et al . 2005 ; xu et al .",
    "2005 ; xu 2005 ; mortsell & sollerman 2005 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we further address the grb standard candle problem by a new statistical approach . instead of sticking to the jet model and searching for the correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( which requires a model- and parameter - dependent jet angle ) , we start with pure observable quantities to search for possible multi - variable correlations by using a regression method .",
    "similar technique was employed by schaefer ( 2003 ) .",
    "the motivations of our analysis are two - fold .",
    "first , within the jet model , there is no confident interpretation to the ghirlanda relation .",
    "it is relatively easy to imagine possible correlations between @xmath46 and @xmath48 ( e.g. zhang & mszros 2002a ; rees & mszros 2005 ) , since the latter is also a manifestation of the energy per solid angle along the line of sight , which could be possibly related to the emission spectrum .",
    "however , it is hard to imagine how the global geometry of the emitter would influence the local emission property is constant for all grbs , which is not true ( see also wu , dai , & liang 2004 ) . ] .",
    "since there is no straightforward explanation for the ghirlanda relation , one does not have to stick to this theoretical framework , but should rather try to look for some empirical correlations instead .",
    "this would allow more freedom for possible interpretations .",
    "second , within various theoretical models ( e.g. table 1 of zhang & mszros 2002a ) , the value of @xmath46 depends on multiple parameters .",
    "the problem is intrinsically multi - dimensional .",
    "it is pertinent to search for multi - variable correlations rather than searching for correlations between two parameters only .",
    "the ghirlanda - relation is a relation that bridges the prompt emission and the afterglow phases .",
    "it is also worth checking whether or not there are similar relationships for other parameters .",
    "below we perform a blind search for the possible multi - variable correlations among several essential observable quantities , including the isotropic gamma - ray energy @xmath0 , the isotropic x - ray afterglow energy @xmath49 , the isotropic optical afterglow energy @xmath50 , the cosmological rest frame peak energy @xmath2 , and the cosmological rest frame temporal break in the _ optical _ afterglow light curve ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we describe our sample selection criteria and the data reduction method in  2 .",
    "results of multiple regression analysis are presented in  3 .",
    "a strong dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath52 and @xmath6 is derived from our multi - variable regression analysis . regarding the @xmath53 )",
    "relationship as a luminosity indicator , in  4 we explore the possible constraints on cosmological parameters using the grb sample .",
    "in addition (  5 ) , we perform monte - carlo simulations to investigate the characteristics of the grb sample satisfying the relationship observationally , and examine how both the sample size and the observational precision affect the constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "conclusions and discussion are presented in  6 . throughout the work the hubble constant is adopted as @xmath9 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "our sample includes 15 bursts with measurements of the redshift @xmath28 , the spectral peak energy @xmath54 , and the optical break time @xmath55 .",
    "it has been suggested that the observed amati - relationship and the ghirlanda - relationship are likely due to some selection effects ( nakar & piran 2005 ; band & preece 2005 ) .",
    "the sample from which the relations are drawn may therefore be ill - defined if the parent sample is the whole grb population .",
    "however , we believe that due to the great diversity of grbs and their afterglow observations , one does not have to require all grbs to form a global sample to serve as a standard candle . if one can identify a subclass of grbs to act as a standard candle ( such as sne ia in the supernova zoo ) , such a sample could give meaningful implications to cosmology .",
    "our selected grbs belong to such a category , which assemble a unique and homogeneous subclass .",
    "since not all grbs necessarily have an @xmath54 or a @xmath55 , the parent sample of our small sample is also only a sub - class of the whole grb population .",
    "notice that in order to preserve homogeneity , we do not include those bursts whose afterglow break times were observed in the radio band ( grb 970508 , grb 000418 , grb 020124 ) or in the x - ray band ( grb970828 ) , but were not seen in the optical band . since we are not sticking to the jet model , we do not automatically accept that there should be a temporal break as well in the optical band .",
    "we also exclude those bursts whose @xmath54 or @xmath55 are not directly measured ( but with upper or lower limits inferred from theoretical modeling ) .",
    "this gives a sample of 15 bursts up to feb , 2005 .",
    "they are tabulated in table 1 with the following headings : ( 1 ) the grb name ; ( 2 ) the redshift ; the spectral fitting parameters including ( 3 ) the spectral peak energy @xmath56 ( with error @xmath57 ) , ( 4 ) the low - energy spectral index @xmath58 , and ( 5 ) the high - energy spectral index @xmath59 ; ( 6 ) the @xmath60-ray fluence ( @xmath61 ) normalized to a standard band pass ( @xmath62 kev in the cosmological rest frame ) according to spectral fitting parameters ( with error @xmath63 ) ; ( 7 ) the corresponding observation energy band ; and ( 8) the references for these observational data . our grb sample essentially resemble those used in ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , dai et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and xu et al .",
    "these bursts are included in the table 1 of friedmann & bloom ( 2005 ) , but that table also includes those bursts with only limits for @xmath54 , @xmath64 , and @xmath28 , as well as those bursts whose @xmath55 were observed in the non - optical bands ( or inferred from theoretical model fittings ) .",
    "we believe that our sample is more homogeneous than the sample listed in friedmann & bloom ( 2005 ) .    the x - ray and optical afterglow data of these grbs",
    "are listed in table 2 with the following headings : ( 1 ) the grb name ; ( 2 ) the x - ray afterglow temporal decay index , @xmath65 ; ( 3 ) the epoch of x - ray afterglow observation ( in units of hours ) ; ( 4 ) the 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux ( @xmath66 , in units of @xmath67 erg cm @xmath68 s @xmath10 ) at the corresponding epoch ; ( 5 ) the 2 - 10 kev x - ray afterglow flux normalized to 10 hours after the burst trigger ( including the error ) ; ( 6 ) the temporal break ( including the error ) of the optical afterglow light curves ( @xmath69 ) ; ( 7 ) the optical temporal decay index before the break ( @xmath70 ) ; ( 8) the optical temporal decay index after the break ( @xmath71 ) ; ( 9 ) the references ; ( 10 ) the r - band optical afterglow magnitudes at 11 hours .",
    "we find that the mean values of @xmath65 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 in our sample are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "for those bursts whose @xmath65 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 values are not available , we take these means in our calculation .    with the data collected in tables 1 and 2 , we calculate the total isotropic emission energies in the gamma - ray prompt phase ( @xmath43 ) , in the x - ray afterglow ( @xmath77 ) , and in the optical afterglow ( r band ) ( @xmath50 ) , i.e. @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the luminosity distance at the redshift @xmath28 , @xmath82 is a k - correction factor to correct the observed gamma - ray fluence at an observed bandpass to a given bandpass in the cosmological rest frame ( @xmath62 kev in this analysis ) , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are , respectively , the starting and the ending times of the afterglow phase , @xmath66 is the flux of the x - ray afterglow in the 2 - 10 kev band , and @xmath85 is the flux of the optical afterglow in the r band ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "since the very early afterglows might be significantly different from the later afterglows , which were not directly detected for the grbs in our sample , we thus take @xmath87 hour",
    ". we also choose @xmath88 days .",
    "the derived @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are tabulated in table 3 .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , previous authors interpret the relationship among @xmath92 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 based on the grb jet model ( e.g. , rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the relationship among the three quantities becomes the @xmath93 relationship .",
    "when this relation is expanded , one gets @xmath94 .",
    "the indices for @xmath43 and @xmath95 are not independent and are bound by the jet model . however , since the current jet model is difficult to accommodate the @xmath96 relationship , we no longer need to assume an underlying correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath95 .",
    "we therefore leave all the indices as free parameters and perform a multiple variable regression analysis to search a possible empirical relationship among @xmath97 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we also extend our analysis to search the dependence of @xmath98 and @xmath99 on @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "the regression model we use reads @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we measure the significance level of the dependence of each variable on the model by the probability of a t - test ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the significance of the global regression is measured by a f - test ( the @xmath106-test statistics and the corresponding significance level @xmath107 ) and a spearman linear correlation between @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( the correlation coefficient @xmath110 and the significance level @xmath111 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath92 strongly depends on both @xmath2 and @xmath3 with a very small uncertainty ( table 4 , fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the actual dependence format depends on the cosmology adopted . for a flat universe with @xmath8 ,",
    "this relation reads @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "however , when we test the possible correlations among @xmath114 ( or @xmath115 ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , no significant correlation is found ( table 4 , figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath116 relationship is so small that it could potentially serve as a luminosity indicator for the cosmological study .",
    "this relationship is _ purely empirical _ , exclusively using directly measured quantities , and without imposing any theoretical models and assumptions .",
    "it therefore suffers less uncertainties / criticisms than does the ghirlanda relation ( e.g. friedmann & bloom 2005 ) . below we will discuss the cosmological implications for this new empirical luminosity indicator .",
    "the distance modulus of a grb , which is defined as @xmath117 , could be measured by this luminosity indicator as @xmath118 - 97.45.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the luminosity indicator is cosmology - dependent , @xmath119 is also cosmology - dependent .",
    "we therefore can not directly use this relationship for our purpose .",
    "ideally , it should be calibrated by local grbs ( e.g. , @xmath120 ) , as is the case of type ia supernova cosmology . however , the grb low redshift sample is small .",
    "more importantly , the local grbs appear to have different characteristics than the cosmological ones ( e.g. long lag , less luminous etc ) , so that they may not belong to the subclass of grbs we are discussing . we are left out without a _ real _ ( cosmological - independent ) luminosity indicator at this time .",
    "we adopt the following method to circumvent the difficulty .",
    "we first recalibrate this relationship in each cosmological model , and then calculate the goodness of the relationship in that cosmology by @xmath121 statistics .",
    "we then construct a relation which is weighed by the goodness of each cosmology - dependent relationship , and use this cosmology - weighed relationship to measure the universe .",

    "we randomly select sub - samples of 25 , 50 , 75 , and 100 grbs from the mock grb sample .",
    "we compare the @xmath14 contours of likelihood distributions in the ( @xmath15 , @xmath124)-plane derived from these sub - samples in the left panel of figure [ fig9 ] . it is evident that , as the sample size increases , the constraint on @xmath15 and @xmath124 becomes more tighter . comparing the left panel of figure",
    "[ fig9 ] with the figure 8 in riees et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we find that the likelihood contour derived from the sub - sample of 50 grbs is comparable to that derived from the gold sample of 157 sne ia .",
    "precision cosmology requires accurate observations .",
    "modern sophisticated observation techniques in distant sne ia ( e.g. riess et al . 1998 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations ( e.g. bennett et al .",
    "2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) have made great progress on modern precision cosmology .",
    "we inspect the uncertainties of the distance modulus derived from the sne ia data , and find that the average uncertainty is @xmath218 , while for our grb sample it is 0.45 . increasing observational precision ( i.e. reducing the errors ) should significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "we simulate another grb sample with systematically smaller _ observational errors _ , i.e. @xmath219 in the step 5 of our simulation procedure .",
    "we get a sample with @xmath220 , comparable to the sne ia gold sample .",
    "the comparison of the likelihood contours ( @xmath14 ) in the @xmath221 plane derived from a sample of 50 mock grbs with @xmath222 ( the line contour ) and with @xmath220 ( the grey contour ) are shown in the right panel of figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "it is found that the latter is significantly tighter , which is comparable to that derived from a sample of 100 mock grbs with an average error in modulus of 0.45 .",
    "the results in figures [ fig9 ] indicate that tighter constraints on cosmological parameters could be achieved by either enlarging the sample size or increasing the observational precision .",
    "if a sample of 50 grbs with a comparable observational precision as sne ia gold sample could be established , the constraints are even tighter than those derived from the sne ia gold sample .",
    "without imposing any theoretical models and assumptions , we investigate the relationship among @xmath0 , @xmath223 and @xmath3 using a multiple variable regression method .",
    "our grb sample includes 15 bursts , whose @xmath2 and @xmath3 are well measured .",
    "the results indicate that @xmath97 strongly depends on both @xmath224 and @xmath3 with a very small dispersion , e.g. eq.([mr ] ) for a flat universe with @xmath8 .",
    "we also perform a similar analysis by replacing @xmath43 by the isotropic afterglow energies in the x - ray and optical bands , and find that these energies are essentially not related to @xmath2 and @xmath3 at all .",
    "we then use the @xmath53 ) relationship as a luminosity indicator to infer the possible cosmology implications from the grb sample . since this relationship is cosmology - dependent , we suggest a new method to weigh various cosmology - dependent relationships with its probability of being the right one , and use the cosmology - weighed standard candle to explore the most plausible cosmological parameters .",
    "our results show that the most possible values are @xmath225 . at @xmath14 level",
    ", we have @xmath13 and @xmath18 . in the case of a flat universe , the @xmath14 constraints are @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the decelerating factor of the universe ( @xmath21 ) and its cosmological evolution @xmath22 are also investigated with an evolutionary form of @xmath23 .",
    "the grb sample implies that the most possible values of @xmath170 are @xmath226 , and they are constrained in the ranges of @xmath25 and @xmath26 at @xmath14 level .",
    "a transition redshift between the deceleration and the acceleration phases of the universe is inferred as @xmath178 at @xmath14 level from the grb sample .    as a luminosity indicator",
    ", our model - independent @xmath227 relationship takes the advantage upon the previous ghirlanda - relation in that only pure observational data are involved . since this luminosity indicator is cosmology - dependent",
    ", we use a strategy through weighing this relationship in all possible cosmologies to statistically study the cosmography and cosmological dynamics .",
    "a similar method has been used in the sn cosmology when dealing with the uncertainty of the present hubble constant @xmath151 . in their method",
    "( e.g. riess et al .",
    "1998 ) , the systematic error of @xmath151 is not included to calculate the error of the distance modulus .",
    "rather , they integrated the probability of @xmath151 over a large range values ( without weighing for each value of @xmath151 ) .",
    "this is the so - called marginalization method .",
    "we also perform this marginalization method to deal with our coefficients ( @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 ) , and re - do the cosmology - analysis .",
    "this is equivalent to integrating over the whole cosmology parameter space without weighing , i.e. , @xmath231 the result using this method to constrain @xmath15 and @xmath17 is presented in figure [ fig10 ] . comparing it with fig.[fig5 ] , we find that both methods give consistent results , but fig.[fig5 ] gives a tighter constraint on cosmological parameters .",
    "this is understandable , since the weighing method reduces the contributions of side lobe around the `` true '' cosmologies . in any case ,",
    "an essential ingredient of both methods is that the uncertainty of the standard candle itself is not included in calculating the uncertainty of the distance modulus derived from the data .",
    "if the uncertainty of the standard candle is indeed included in the uncertainty of the distance modulus , with eqs.([pw ] ) and ( [ pm ] ) to calculate @xmath157 , one gets a very loose constraint ( fig.[fig11 ] ) .",
    "even at @xmath14 level the current grb sample can not place any meaningful constraints on both @xmath15 and @xmath232 .",
    "we believe , however , that in such a treatment , the uncertainty of the distance modulus is over - estimated , since the error introduced from measurements should not be mixed with the systematic uncertainty of the standard candle .",
    "the grb sample from which our relationship is drawn is currently small .",
    "the constraints on the cosmological parameters derived from this sample are weaker than those from the sne ia gold sample .",
    "our simulations indicate that either the enlargement of the sample size or the increase of the observational precision could greatly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters",
    ". a sample of 50 bursts with the current observational precision would be comparable to the 157 sne ia gold sample in constraining cosmology , and a better constraint is achievable with better observational precisions or an even larger sample size .",
    "our simulations also indicate that the grb sample satisfying our relationship observationally tends to be a soft and bright one , for which @xmath233 is in the reasonable range for detection .",
    "detailed optical afterglow light curves covering from a few hours to about ten days after the burst trigger are required to measure the @xmath55 value . the observed @xmath55 ranges from 0.4 days to 5 days in the current grb sample . in the cgro / batse duration table",
    ", there are @xmath234 long grbs . to test the probability of a batse burst having a @xmath55 in the range of 0.4 days to 5 days",
    ", we perform a simulation similar to that described in  5 , but take the @xmath54 and @xmath61 distributions directly from the batse observations .",
    "we find that the probability is @xmath235 in the cosmology of @xmath203 and @xmath236 .",
    "among well localized grbs about @xmath237 of bursts are optically bright .",
    "we thus estimate that there have been @xmath238 batse grbs that might have been detected to satisfy our @xmath239 relationship .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig9 ] , such a sample is comparable to the sne ia gold sample for constraining cosmological parameters . a dedicated grb mission carrying a batse - liked grb detector and having the capability of precisely localizing and following up grbs ( like _ swift _ ) would be ideal to establish a homogenous grb sample to perform precision grb cosmology ( lamb et al .",
    "2005b ) .    since launched on nov . 20 , 2004 , the _ swift _ mission ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) is regularly detecting grbs with a rate of @xmath240 bursts per year .",
    "detailed x - ray and uv / optical afterglow observations spanning from 1 minute to several days after the burst have been performed for most of the bursts .",
    "however , the energy band of the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) is narrow , i.e. 15 - 150 kev . as we shown in figure [ fig8 ] , the typical @xmath54 of a burst in our sample is marginally at the end of the bat energy band . as a result",
    ", bat is not ideal for the purpose of expanding the sample for grb cosmology . as a result",
    ", we do not expect a dramatic enlargement of our sample in the _ swift _ era .",
    "nonetheless , those bursts with an @xmath54 of @xmath241 kev could have their @xmath54 well - measured by _",
    "swift_. we therefore highly recommend a detailed optical follow - up observations for these bursts with uvot and/or other ground - based optical telescopes .",
    "this would present an opportunity to enlarge our sample with the _ swift _ data .",
    "the major advantage of grbs serving as a standard candle over sne ia is their high - redshift nature .",
    "the observed spectra and fluences of high redshift grbs may not be too different from the nearby ones ( lamb & reichart 2000 ) .",
    "for example , the fluence of grb 000131 ( @xmath242 ) is @xmath243 erg cm@xmath68 in the 25 - 100 kev band ( hurley et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is significantly larger than the fluence of typical grbs ( @xmath245 erg cm@xmath68 in the 25 - 2000 kev band ) .",
    "the highest redshift burst in our sample is grb 020124 ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "its fluence is @xmath247 erg cm@xmath68 in the 30 - 400 kev band , and its observed peak energy is 120 kev .",
    "these indicate that the current grb missions , such as _ swift _ and _ hete-2 _ , are adequate to observe high redshift grbs .",
    "this is not an issue if the grb redshift is small . for high-@xmath28 grbs ,",
    "the optical band in the observer s frame is highly extincted by neutral hydrogen , but one could still detect @xmath248 from the infrared band .",
    "infrared band observations are also essential for identify high-@xmath28 grbs .",
    "ir follow up observations are therefore essential to add the high-@xmath28 bursts in our sample . ] .",
    "we explore how the constraints on cosmological parameters are improved by identifying several high - redshift bursts .",
    "we artificially select 5 high redshift grbs from our simulated grb sample with @xmath249 , respectively , and with observational errors @xmath213 .",
    "the constraints on the cosmological parameters from these pseudo high - z grbs together with the current observed grb sample are shown in figure [ fig12 ] ( the grey contour ) , where the results from the current observed grb sample are also plotted for comparison ( the line contours ) .",
    "it is found that adding a few high-@xmath28 grbs could result in much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters . identifying high-@xmath28 grbs and measuring their @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "are therefore essential for the grb cosmology in the near future .",
    "our model - independent relationship is close to the ghirlanda relationship , which was derived based on a simplest version of grb jet models .",
    "in such a model invoking a jet with energy uniformly distributed in the jet cone , the observable @xmath55 is physically related to the epoch when the bulk lorentz factor of the ejecta is reduced to the inverse of the jet opening angle ( rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "relating @xmath55 to the jet openning angle , the jet energy is then given by @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is circum - burst medium density and @xmath252 is the efficiency of grbs .",
    "the ghirlanda - relation can be then expressed as @xmath253 . comparing this with our model - independent relationship ( eq.[mr ] )",
    ", we can see that both relations are roughly consistent with each other if @xmath251 and @xmath252 are universal among bursts . as discussed above , the motivations for us to introduce our multi - variable relationship are two folds .",
    "firstly , @xmath251 and @xmath254 may not be constant and actually vary from burst to burst .",
    "this introduces a lot more uncertainties in the ghirlanda relationship ( e.g. friedman & bloom 2005 ) .",
    "secondly and more importantly , there is no straightforward interpretation of the relation within the jet model .",
    "jumping out from the jet model framework would give more freedom of theoretical interpretations .",
    "the tight relation of @xmath255 is very intriguing , and its physical reason calls for investigation . the fact that @xmath0 strongly depends on @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while both @xmath256 and @xmath257 do not , implies that @xmath3 is a quantity related to grbs rather than to their afterglows .",
    "a similar signature was previously found by salmonson & galama ( 2002 ) , who discovered a tight correlation between the pulse spectral lag of grb light curves and @xmath55 .",
    "we therefore suspect that @xmath55 might be a unique probe for the grb prompt emission properties . within the jet scenario ,",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath55 and @xmath258 ( first revealed by frail et al . 2001 ) may be physically related to the different metalicity abundances of the progenitor stars ( e.g. metal - poor stars rotate more rapidly , and the grbs they produce are more energetic and have more collimated jets , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ) or may be simply a manifestation of the viewing angle effect in a structured - jet scenario ( rossi et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang & mszros 2002b ) .",
    "such an anti - correlation , when combined with the physical models of @xmath259 correlations ( e.g. zhang & mszros 2002a ; rees & mszros 2005 ) , may be able to interpret the observed @xmath255 relation , although a detailed model is yet constructed .",
    "alternatively , there might be a completely different physical reason under the @xmath255 relationship which is not attached to the jet picture .",
    "one possibility is that the spectral break in the prompt emission and the temporal break in the optical band may be related to a same evolving break in the electron spectral distribution ( b. zhang , 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "in such an interpretation , the temporal break time in the optical band is expected to be different from those in the radio or in the x - ray bands . since",
    "so far there is no solid proof for the achromatic nature in broad bands for any `` jet break '' , such a possibility is not ruled out .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for valuable comments .",
