    "being a rare resolved debris disk with detected gas , hd 131835  serves as a unique target for studying the relationship between gas - dust physics and planetary science .",
    "hd 131835  is an a2iv star @xcite in the upper centaurus lupus ( ucl ) moving group @xcite , a subgroup of the sco - cen association .",

    "a three - component dust disk model , composed of an unusually warm continuous disk and two rings , was able to simultaneously explain the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the mid - ir thermal images .",
    "compared to recent disk studies with gpi , such as hd 115600 @xcite and hd 106906 @xcite , hd 131835  is less inclined and the disk flux is more radially extended ( @xmath11 to @xmath12 au ) , allowing us to better study its morphological features . here",
    "we report the first scattered light detection of dust surrounding hd 131835  in polarized light with gpi .",
    "we observed hd 131835  as one of our gpi exoplanet survey ( gs-2015a - q-500 ) campaign targets with gpi at the gemini south observatory , cerro pachon , chile . on 2015",
    "may 01 , we obtained thirty - two 60-s exposures in @xmath0-band polarimetry mode @xcite with waveplate angles of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . on 2015",

    "the radius of the @xmath0-band focal plane mask ( fpm ) is 0.123 . because the star is behind the occulter in the coronagraphic mode , astrometric and photometric calibrations use satellite spots , which are diffracted starlight formed by a square pupil - plane grating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the data were reduced using the gpi data reduction pipeline ( drp , @xcite ) .",
    "polarimetry data were dark subtracted , corrected for flexure @xcite , cleaned for correlated noise @xcite , interpolated over bad pixels in the 2-d detector image , and assembled into data `` cubes '' with the third dimension comprising the two orthogonal polarization states . to get the stokes cube ,",
    "the images were divided by a low spatial frequency , polarized flat field @xcite , interpolated over bad pixels in the 3-d datacubes , mitigated for systematics between the two orthogonal polarization channels via double differencing , subtracted for the instrumental polarization within each data cube @xcite using the average polarization fraction measured within the fpm , rotated to align the image orientations , and combined using singular value decomposition matrix inversion .",
    "the spectroscopic data were dark subtracted , flexure corrected and wavelength calibrated @xcite with an @xmath0-band ar arc lamp taken right before the science sequence , interpolated over bad pixels in 2-d , assembled into a spectral datacube , interpolated over bad pixels in 3-d , and corrected for distortion .",
    "we perform photometric calibration on the polarimetry data by considering the satellite spot to star flux ratio @xmath20 , the stellar flux @xmath21 in physical units , and the average satellite spot flux @xmath22 in analog - to - digital unit ( adu ) per coadd .",
    "the calibrated image data @xmath23 can be found by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the image data in adu coadd@xmath26 . in gpi @xmath0-band , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath28 mjy as the @xmath0-band flux of hd 131835  from 2mass @xcite .",
    "we use an elongated aperture , similar to the shape of a running track , to perform aperture photometry on the satellite spots in polarimetry mode .",
    "we obtain a conversion factor of @xmath29 with the uncertainty mostly stemming from measurement of @xmath22 .",
    "the photometric calibration in the spectral mode @xcite is done using the calibrated datacube extraction recipe via the gpi drp based on the same principle .",
    "however , instead of using the broad band @xmath21 and @xmath22 fluxes in the above equation , we replace them with the host star spectrum and the average satellite spot spectrum . for the stellar spectrum , we use the idl astrolib routine ccm_unred.pro ( based on @xcite ) to apply @xmath30 = 0.187 mag .",

    "we resolve the debris disk around hd 131835  through polarimetric differential imaging ( pdi ) . figure  [ fig : radial_pol ] shows the calibrated gpi @xmath0-band polarized intensity of hd 131835  in radial stokes @xmath33 @xcite . in the sign convention adopted here ,",
    "positive @xmath33 shows the tangentially polarized intensity while negative @xmath33 represents radially polarized intensity .",
    "the disk appears to be inclined with scattered light extending from @xmath675120  au . by fitting the location of the flux peak along the major axis on each wing , we find no significant offset that is larger than 300 mas .",
    "if we assume an axisymmetric and radially smooth density structure , the projected eccentricity , @xmath34 , along the major axis is consistent with zero , and @xmath35 is rejected at 1-@xmath5 . due to the non - detection on the southeast ( se ) quadrant",
    ", the eccentricity along the minor axis is left unconstrained .",
    "the data are limited by instrumental polarization within the central @xmath36 and by photon noise at larger radii .",
    "figure [ fig : radial_pol ] shows brightness asymmetries along both the minor and major axes . the northwest ( nw ) side of the disk is significantly brighter than the se side , which is undetected .",
    "this brightness asymmetry is likely due to light scattered in a preferential direction as seen in the case of hr 4796a @xcite .",
    "in addition , a weaker brightness asymmetry is present along the major axis . to quantify this brightness asymmetry",
    ", we use the best - fit geometric parameters found in  [ sec : model ] ( except for setting the outer radius to be 180  au due to the limited fov ) and consider the region exterior to @xmath37 on the nw side of the major axis . since single scattering by circumstellar dust is expected to produce linearly polarized light only in the @xmath33 polarization states , we measure the noise using stokes @xmath38 which corresponds to the linear polarization @xmath15 from @xmath33 .",
    "the error at each angular separation in the @xmath33 image was estimated by measuring the standard deviation of the three - pixel wide annulus at the same separation in the stokes @xmath38 image .",
    "we find the northeast ( ne ) side of the disk is @xmath39 times brighter than the southwest ( sw ) side .",
    "in contrast , the thermal imaging shows the sides are equally bright , with a 30% brightness asymmetry excluded at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "to subtract the stellar psf from the total intensity polarimetry and spectroscopic images , we used a python implementation of the karhunen - love image projection ( klip ) algorithm @xcite , pyklip @xcite to perform psf subtraction using angular differential imaging ( adi , @xcite ) .",
    "we divided the images into three annuli and four azimuthal subsections and ran klip over each zone , using an angular exclusion criterion of 5 degrees to select reference images .",
    "we used the first five kl basis vectors to estimate the psf for each subsection .",
    "these parameters were selected by optimizing the throughput of an injected model disk .",
    "the disk is undetected in both stokes @xmath41 and spectral data .",
    "the non - detection could be a result of the faintness of the disk as well as severe adi self - subtraction .",
    "even with the total field rotation being @xmath17 , the radially extended geometry of the moderately inclined disk makes it particularly susceptible to the latter effect . to get an upper limit on the total intensity",
    ", we inject increasingly brighter model disks ( discussed in ",
    "[ sec : model ] ) into the raw data and find when we can recover the disk after the psf subtraction .",
    "the 3-@xmath5 upper limit on the peak total intensity in the polarimetry data is 140 mjy arcsec@xmath42 , giving a lower limit of the peak polarization fraction of 1% .",
    "the spectral data gives a less constraining upper limit .",
    "these upper limits are larger than the total intensity of the best - fit model discussed in section  [ sec : model ] , thus demonstrating consistency between our empirical upper limits and our modeling .",
    "we process our spectroscopic - mode data to optimize planet detection .",
    "we first subtract the psf for each wavelength channel using the tloci code @xcite , which assumes an input spectrum to optimize the subtraction while maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of an exoplanet of that specific spectral type . for our analysis , t8 and l8 spectra are chosen as the priors based on our experience to cover a wide range of dusty @xcite and cond @xcite exoplanets .",
    "the final data cube is then collapsed by a weighted mean , considering the input spectrum and the noise .",
    "we search for point sources with planet - like spectra but detect none . to estimate our upper limits",
    ", we derive the tloci contrast curves by measuring the standard deviation of the pixel noise in each annulus of @xmath43 width .",
    "these contrast curves are then transformed into exoplanet mass upper limits using the bt - settl models @xcite . in our polarimetry mode observation ,",
    "we derive the point source contrast curves by dividing the scatter ( due to photon and read noise ) at each annulus by the stellar flux , similar to how the contrast curves are derived in the spectroscopic mode .",
    "the contrast curves for the total and polarized intensities and mass limits derived from the spectral - mode observations are shown in figure  [ fig : spec_contrast ] .",
    "we reject objects with m @xmath44 outside of @xmath45 .",
    "we take a two - step approach to find a model that fits the sed and the gpi image .",
    "first , we use a geometric model to retrieve the structure of the scattered - light disk .",
    "then , fixing the disk geometry , we search for a physical model that is built on the model proposed by @xcite to get an estimate of the main dust properties associated with the polarized scattered light detection . in both steps",
    ", we exclude the central region within @xmath37 due to uncorrected systematic errors from the instrumental polarization and cut out the region beyond 260  au in the disk plane to reduce the number of pixels without detected disk signal .",
    "to measure the basic geometric properties of disk , we adopt a simple two - dimensional continuous disk model . since the disk is not detected at all azimuths , we cut off @xmath46 symmetrically about the se semi - minor axis in our model ( white dashed lines in figure  [ fig : model ] ) to exclude the region with s / n @xmath47 .",
    "the model extends from the inner radius @xmath48 to the outer radius @xmath49 with the surface brightness varying only as @xmath50 . along with the position angle @xmath51 of the major axis and the inclination",
    "@xmath52 , we use these five parameters to describe the geometric properties of the disk .",
    "we fit the data using the ` emcee ` python package @xcite based on the ensemble mcmc method of @xcite . after a burn - in period",
    ", we let the 100 walkers run for 1200 steps .",
    "the best - fit parameters and uncertainties listed in table  [ tab : model_parameters ] are found by taking the median of the marginalized probability density distributions and finding the 1-@xmath5 confidence intervals .",
    "the shapes of the posterior distributions are all single - peaked and approximately normal . assuming that the disk is optically thin and the polarization fraction and the phase function",
    "do not depend on the stellocentric radius , the value of @xmath53 implies a nearly flat surface density profile of @xmath54 .",

    "using mie theory , mcfost self - consistently computes the absorption and scattering cross - sections as well as the scattering angle - dependent mueller matrix , producing model images for all stokes parameters .",
    "we assume a geometrically flat disk and start by modifying the two - component model from @xcite to match the gpi image and the sed .",
    "we set the hotter extended component to have amorphous carbon @xcite as its composition based on the suggested high grain temperatures @xcite .",
    "we keep all its parameters ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , disk extent @xmath79 , power - law index of the surface density @xmath80 , grain size @xmath81 , grain size distribution power - law index @xmath75 , and mass of the dust @xmath77 ) fixed as listed in table  [ tab : model_parameters ] .",
    "the cooler ring component has its geometry fixed to be the values found in the previous paragraph and composition set to be 50% amorphous carbon and 50% astro - silicate @xcite .",
    "we have considered arguably simpler compositions ( pure silicates and pure amorphous carbon ) but they produce worse model fits . adding water ice to the composition or porosity to the grains",
    "also leads to poorer model fits .",
    "we simultaneously fit our mcfost model to the sed and the scattered light disk at all azimuthal angles . in the fit , we weight the residuals from each pixel and broadband photometry point equally .",
    "in addition to fitting photometry points long - ward of 10 @xmath10 m  ( summarized in @xcite ) , we include six new @xmath82 points from @xcite . with the disk geometry and dust composition fixed ,",
    "the only free parameters are the size distribution and @xmath77 .",
    "the sed can only place a lower limit on the maximum grain size so we adopt @xmath83 .",
    "this only leaves the minimum grain size @xmath73 , @xmath75 , and @xmath84 of the cooler component to vary . to explore the parameter space",

    "the best - fit model image fits the disk ansae well .",
    "the slight over - subtraction near the inner edge is not significant given the noise in these regions .",
    "although the hotter component does not contribute significantly to the scattered - light image , this component is an important source for thermal emission .",
    "our best - fit mcfost model also roughly reproduces the extended thermal emission .",
    "we can further improve our model with detailed analysis , such as more complex dust composition and grain size distribution , but those are beyond the scope of this letter . nonetheless , we set strong constraints on the disk properties , reproducing the surface brightness of the scattered - light disk with a model that was initially devised exclusively on thermal emission .",
    "we find a minimum grain size that is in reasonable agreement with the expected blowout size of 0.91 @xmath10 m  and the grain size power law index only slightly steeper than the canonical @xmath86 .",
    "overall , the grains detected with gpi seems to follow the intuitive expectations of common disk properties .",
    "the mid - ir @xcite and scattered - light images show different morphology . unlike the continuous and extended thermal emission , the disk in scattered light has a cleared region inwards of @xmath3 au . in other words ,",
    "the scattered light disk starts at a radius that is twice as far away from the star compared to the disk in thermal emission .",
    "in polarized scattered light , we detect brightness asymmetries strongly along the minor axis and weakly along the major axis .",
    "the brightness asymmetry along the minor axis is likely due to asymmetry in the scattering phase function and is present in our best - fit model",
    ". the brightness asymmetry along the major axis could be the result of a dust density enhancement , azimuthal variation of grain compositions , or a projection effect of an eccentric disk if this 3-@xmath5 feature is real .",
    "since the mid - ir data do not show the asymmetry along the major axis , it suggests that the large grain population is more symmetrically arranged than the small grain population .",
    "the simulation done by @xcite shows that dust that originates in the breakup of planetesimals trapped in resonance with a planet can have moderate - sized grains ( a few @xmath10 m  to a few mm ) distributed axisymmetrically but small grains ( less than a few @xmath10 m ) exhibit trailing spiral structure that emanates from the resonant clumps .",
    "therefore , the mismatched distributions of large and small grains can identify different forces acting on them and highlight potentially interesting dynamical interactions in the system .",
    "hd 131835  is distinctive compared with the other sco - cen debris disks that have recently been imaged in scattered light : hip 79977 , hd 115600 , hd 106906 , and hd 110058 @xcite . among those ,",
    "hd 131835  has the largest inner radius in the scattered light - detected component and the most radially extended and nearly flat surface density profile ( from 75 to 210 au with @xmath87 ) .",
    "the other disks either have relatively narrow belts ( hd 115600 , hd 106906 , and hd 110058 ) or have relatively sharp declines in brightness ( hip 79977 ) .",
    "the extended and approximately flat surface density profile suggests the parent body belt of hd 131835  is likely to be extremely broad , much more so than any other debris disks imaged to date .",
    "this novel feature we found indicates the silicate component is not distributed in the form of one or two narrow rings as previously suggested by @xcite .",
    "in addition , among all the sco - cen disks , hd 131835  is the only resolved disk with detected co gas @xcite , making it a unique and valuable target for studying gas - dust interactions . besides the potential dynamical influence of undetected exoplanets , interactions between dust and gas",
    "could also play a significant role in clearing the dust in the inner disk and creating an eccentric ring @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations and detailed modeling are required to characterize the disk in detail .",
    "deeper polarimetry observations are needed to confirm the ne - sw asymmetry .",
    "detection of the disk in total intensity can set a firm constraint on the grain shape and porosity by providing the information on the fractional polarization as a function of scattering angle .",
