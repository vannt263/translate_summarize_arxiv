    "the @xmath78 dependence is mainly an orbital effect @xcite ; it is very strong for @xmath1-gaas samples with wider potential well @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath79 dependence is apparently a spin - related effect @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath10 and @xmath0 on @xmath80 is another reason for the deviation of the high - field @xmath9 values from the low field results of sdh measurements . in gaas ,",

    "@xcite from the temperature dependence of the conductivity , differ substantially from the values determined for @xmath1-si- and @xmath1-gaas - based structures ( see fig .  [ fig : f0(rs ) ] ) .",
    "it is highly unlikely that the values of @xmath132 `` jump up '' around @xmath133 ( where the data are currently missing ) ; such possibility is also at odds with the numerical results .",
    "rather , this non - monotonic dependence might signal either the lack of the universal dependence @xmath132 or an incorrect quantification of the effective interaction strength in different systems .    to choose between the aforementioned options ,",
    "let us compare the charge transport in @xmath1-type and @xmath16-gaas systems in the low - density regime .",
    "it is well - known that the experimental data for various 2d electron and hole systems studied so far exhibit a number of empirical similarities ( quantitative within the same host material and qualitative - for different systems ) .",
    "the two of them are : ( i ) the relationship between the `` critical '' @xmath134 and @xmath4 values , and ( ii ) the magnitude of the resistivity drop @xmath135 at a given resistivity @xmath136 value .",
    "both dependences imply a similar mechanism : the higher the quality of the sample , the larger the critical @xmath4 ( i.e. the lower @xmath2 ) , @xmath82 , @xmath134 and the magnitude of the resistance drop .",
    "these qualitative features have been explained by the theory @xcite , where the only sample- ( or disorder- ) dependent parameter is the mean free time @xmath103 ( the higher @xmath103 , the stronger the `` metallic '' @xmath108 dependence ) .",
    "the low density @xmath16-gaas @xcite,@xcite samples demonstrate different features : on the one hand , the @xmath4-values are extremely high ( thus indicating a high sample quality and strong interactions ) , on the other hand , the signatures of the metallic behaviour are rather weak . for the highest @xmath4 data @xcite",
    "the renormalized fermi energy is so small ( @xmath137k ) that the 2d systems becomes non - degenerate very quickly as @xmath73 grows .",
    "this might explain the weak magnitude of the resistance drop in the measurements of ref .",
    "however , this line of reasoning can not be applied to the higher - density ( 311 ) @xmath16-gaas samples @xcite , in which the fermi energy is larger . in order to bring the above data for @xmath16-gaas into agreement with other data",
    ", one has to scale the @xmath4 values down by a factor of 6 @xcite and factor of 8 @xcite .",
    "it might be , therefore , that the effective @xmath3-@xmath3 interactions are weaker in @xmath16-gaas samples than in the other systems for the same @xmath4 value , owing , e.g. , to a more complicated physics of the multivalley band structure and strong spin - orbit effects .",
    "if this is the case , the interactions in @xmath16-gaas samples can not be adequately quantified with a single parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .  [",
    "fig : f0(rs ) ] by a simple rescaling of the effective @xmath4 values for the data on @xmath16-gaas @xcite . despite the raw data differ substantially , they come into a reasonable agreement when @xmath4 for @xmath16-gaas is scaled down by an empirical factor @xmath138 . of course , from this rescaling",
    ", it is impossible to conclude whether the effective @xmath4 values should be increased for @xmath1-si- and @xmath1-gaas- based structures , or decreased for @xmath16-gaas ; however , the multitude of the material systems which show reasonably consistent data , points at a somewhat more complex behavior in @xmath16-gaas .",
    "the same empirical scaling procedure , being applied to the @xmath131 data for @xmath16-gaas , helps to resolve another puzzle . the data for the effective mass that were found in ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath4 independent over the range @xmath139 , after such rescaling will fall into the range @xmath140 , where the mass variations with @xmath4 are small ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : m(rs ) ] ) .",
    "to summarize , we compared various experimental data on the renormalization of the effective spin susceptibility , effective mass , and @xmath0-factor .",
    "if the data are considered on the same footing , one finds a good agreement between different sets of data , measured by different experimental teams using different experimental techniques , and for different 2d electron systems .",
    "the consistency of the data provides an additional evidence that the renormalization is indeed caused by the fermi - liquid effects .",
    "the renormalization is not strongly affected by material- and sample - dependent parameters such as the width of the potential well , disorder ( sample mobility ) and the band mass value .",
    "the apparent disagreement between the reported results is caused mainly by different interpretation of similar raw data . among the most important issues to be taken into account in the data processing ,",
    "there are the dependences of the effective mass and spin susceptibility on the in - plane field , and the temperature dependence of the dingle temperature ( the latter is intrinsic for strongly - interacting systems ) .",
    "the remaining disagreement with the data for 2d hole system in gaas suggests that the character of the effective electron - electron interaction is more complex in this system ; this important issue deserves thorough theoretical attention .",
