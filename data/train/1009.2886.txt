    "the important question associated with this domain is whether nuclear system can reach thermal equilibrium before break - up or not @xcite .",
    "most of nucleon - nucleon collisions are pauli blocked and mean field governs the reaction dynamics in low energy domain @xcite . in case of peripheral collisions , we have projectile - like and target - like remnants and fusion - fission events dominate the scenario .",
    "the fusion events disappear as the incident energy increases marked by the onset of multifragmentation . in the low energy range ( _ i.e. _ between 40 and 70 mev / a ) , a significant fraction of the intermediate mass fragments originates from mid - velocity region @xcite .",
    "this type of pre - equilibrium emission has been conjectured as ` extended neck ' emission due to the dynamical fluctuations that increase with the incident energy .",
    "many experiments have indicated that binary dissipative collisions ( bdc ) dominate the scenario in such low energy hi collisions @xcite .",
    "as far as decays from quasiprojectile and quasitarget are concerned , molecular dynamics approaches coupled with conventional clusterization algorithm may nt reproduce fragment charge yields accurately @xcite .    in the present paper ,",

    "the confrontation of the theoretical predictions employing advanced clusterization technique with experimental data can be of importance to understand the physical scenario behind cluster production mechanism in low - energy hi collisions .",

    "this sophisticated clusterization approach allows early identification of fragments before these are well separated in coordinate space .",

    "the requirement of a minimum binding energy excludes the loosely bound fragments which will decay at later stage . to look for the most bound configuration ( mbc ) ,",
    "we start from a random configuration which is chosen by dividing whole system into few fragments .",

    "this procedure is known as metropolis algorithm .",
    "the control parameter is decreased in small steps .",
    "this algorithm will yield eventually the most bound configuration ( mbc ) .    since this combination of a metropolis algorithm with slowly decreasing control parameter @xmath24 is known as _ simulated annealing _",
    ", so our approach is dubbed as _ simulated annealing clusterization algorithm _ ( saca ) . for the present calculations we have employed improvised version of saca method in which fragments are confronted against realistic binding energies instead of constant binding energy check of -4.0 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "it may be mentioned that this modification has nearly no effect on final fragment yields and it explains the aladin multifragmentation data @xcite at relativistic energies quite nicely .",

    "one can see that as the nucleon density saturates after violent phase , saca method is able to identify asymptotic size of the heaviest fragment @xmath27 around 100 fm / c .",
    "the qmd+mst approach , on other hand , fails to detect the heaviest fragment @xmath27 even at 300 fm / c .",
    "the heavier @xmath27 detected with mst method at 100 fm / c implies that it still assumes smaller fragments as constituents of @xmath27 , being very closely spaced .",
    "we shall show later on in 3-d space that this @xmath27 in actual consists of bunch of smaller clusters .",
    "the higher multiplicity of fragments with mass a@xmath295 obtained using saca method ( see figure 1c ) clearly shows that @xmath27 detected in the mst approach is actually a bunch of smaller fragments . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , different clusterization approaches converge to same configuration at 1000 fm / c .",

    "the mst method clearly predicts larger production probability for heavier charges .",
    "this method fails to break - up the spectator matter into smaller fragments , therefore leading to overestimated charge of heavier fragments even at 300 fm / c . as a result , the tail of charge spectrum shifts towards the higher z values with mst method",
    "this also highlights the discrepancy in mst procedure to describe the spectator fragmentation using semi - classical transport method .",
    "the origin of the fragments with saca method is , however , quite earlier determined when nuclear matter is still excited and compact .    to derive quantitative information on the phenomenon of stopping",

    "interestingly , we find that the mst method predicts the fragment - emission from mid - rapidity zone only ( as indicated by a peak around @xmath35 ) .",
    "saca approach , on the other hand , indicates significant contribution coming from the target - like and projectile - like remnants apart from the mid - velocity emission .",
    "mst method ca nt cause cause effective break - up of spectator components to generate the imfs close to the target and projectile rapidities even at peripheral geometries .",
    "this reflects non - equilibrium situation in the fragmenting system with saca approach .",
    "the emission of the lcps and imfs near the projectile and target velocities reflects essentially the binary character of the collisions , apart from the midrapidity source emission .",
    "the peaks observed at the target and projectile rapidities is also indicative of dynamical scenario of multi - fragment emission where system has not enough time to pass through a state of thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "it is worth mentioning that ca+ca collisions at 35 mev / a were studied recently within antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) model @xcite .",
    "fragment observables such as transverse kinetic energy of fragments and radial size of the reaction system are observed to deviate appreciably from the assumption of equilibrium ensemble .",
    "this study also favored dynamical scenario of fragmentation .     of lcps ( top panel ) and imfs ( bottom panel )",

    "a significant enhancement in the production of imfs is clearly visible for spectator zones using the saca picture .",
    "the contribution towards the imfs does nt seem to come from any specific region .",
    "in other words , the qmd + saca calculations suggest that imfs originate from the ` extended neck ' region as well as from the spectator zones .",

    "the model predictions using saca ( at 100 fm / c ) and mst ( at 300 fm / c ) approaches are displayed along with experimental data taken with combined multics - miniball ( mm ) array @xcite .",
    "one can see an increasing trend of @xmath41 with impact parameter as is expected due to increase in size of spectator zone in the exit channel . here also , qmd+mst approach fails to break the spectator matter effectively , and therefore leads to overpredicted @xmath41 even at 300 fm / c .",
    "the saca method , on other hand , reproduces the experimental trend quite accurately at an earlier time . from these finding",
    ", we can infer that the saca method is on reliable footing to explore the dynamics of spectator matter fragmentation in low energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "further it allows faster recognition of clusters on reaction time scale .",
    "summarizing , we have performed a comparative study of two different clusterization models by simulating the peripheral @xmath42+@xmath42 collisions at 35 mev / a .",
    "our calculations within qmd approach coupled with saca clusterization subroutine showed that spectator zones contribute significantly towards fragment production in peripheral hi collisions .",
    "contrary to this , the mst method could predict fragment - emission from mid - velocity source only even at 300 fm / c after the initial contact between projectile and target nuclei .",
    "this questions the validity of employing mst method of clusterization to investigate reaction dynamics at low incident energies .",
    "our model predictions using the saca method reveal that significant contribution towards imfs emission is located near the initial target and projectile rapidities .",
    "our model predictions for the charge distribution and mean charge of heaviest fragment @xmath40 using the saca method are in nice agreement with experimental data taken with multics - miniball ( mm ) array @xcite .",
