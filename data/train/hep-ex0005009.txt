    "the first test of cpt invariance using @xmath0 leptons is performed by measuring the masses of the positively and negatively charged @xmath0 leptons separately . to determine the @xmath0 mass we use two pseudomass techniques , previously established by argus @xcite and cleo @xcite , which rely on the reconstruction of the mass , energy , and direction of the hadronic system in hadronic @xmath0 decays .    in the opal detector",
    "charged particle tracks are reconstructed by a central detector consisting of a silicon microvertex detector , a vertex chamber , a large jet chamber , and z - chambers .",
    "photons coming from the decay of neutral pions are measured using a hermetic lead glass calorimeter located outside of the solenoid and an iron  streamer tube sandwich calorimeter is used to measure hadronic showers .",
    "this hadronic calorimeter is used in conjunction with muon chambers mounted around it to separate muons from hadrons in the event selection and decay mode identification .",
    "the opal detector is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in a hadronic @xmath0 decay , the mass of the @xmath0 lepton is related to the 4-momentum of the resulting hadronic system by the formula @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) are the 4-momentum , 3-momentum , and energy of the @xmath0 ( hadronic system ) .",
    "the neutrino mass , @xmath63 , is set to zero and the @xmath0 energy is taken to be the beam energy , thus permitting the mass of the @xmath0 lepton to be reconstructed if the angle @xmath64 between the direction of the @xmath0 and the hadronic system were known . due to the high boost at lep energies , @xmath64 is limited to a few degrees , with the exact limit on @xmath64 depending on @xmath65 .",
    "a pseudomass , @xmath66 ( one value per cone are defined around the leading particles in the event . in most cases a cone",
    "contains the decay products of exactly one @xmath0 . ] ) , is defined by taking @xmath64 to be zero .",
    "it gives the true mass when @xmath67 and is smaller than the true mass in any other case .",
    "the distribution of @xmath66 for @xmath68 decays , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : argus ] is a broad distribution with a sharp cutoff at the @xmath0 mass .",
    "further , the details of the shape of the distribution are determined by the dynamics of the decay with the general tendency that the more massive the hadronic system , the closer the pseudomass is to the cutoff .",
    "however , the position of the cutoff only depends on the mass of the @xmath0 lepton .",
    "the @xmath0 mass is extracted from this position . from fig .",
    "[ fig : argus ] a small tail of pseudomass above the cutoff is evident .",
    "it is caused by three effects : background , resolution , and initial state radiation , the latter weakens the assumption @xmath69 .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .    in @xmath0 pair events where both @xmath0 leptons decay hadronically",
    ", a second pseudomass , @xmath70 , can be defined , which is derived from the event as a whole , not just from one of the two cones . in such events the acollinearity @xmath71 , i.e.  the angle between the hadronic systems from the two decays , carries additional information on the @xmath0 mass ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : angles ] ) .",
    "this acollinearity restricts the decay angles of the @xmath0 leptons through the relation @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the decay angles of the positive and negative @xmath0 in the laboratory frame , respectively .",
    "if the sum of these three angles were known , the mass of the @xmath0 lepton could be reconstructed on an event by event basis . since",
    "this information is unavailable the pseudomass , @xmath70 , is calculated instead , assuming that the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees and that the masses of the positive and negative @xmath0 are equal .",

    "the first two variations each change the result by  kev , while the third has a negligible impact .",

    "* in the derivation of the pseudomass formulae the assumption @xmath105 is used , which is only true in the absence of initial state radiation .",
    "low energy photons from initial state radiation have only a negligible effect on the measurement , while a variation of @xmath106 of the rate of hard initial state radiation results in an uncertainty on the measurement of  kev .",
    "* the uncertainty in the calibration of the beam energy of lep has a negligible effect .",

    "furthermore , we fitted the distributions with the type of step function giving the second best description of the data .",
    "both studies showed consistent results .    adding in quadrature all systematic uncertainties including the statistical error from the monte carlo gives a total systematic uncertainty on the measurement of  mev .",
    "to test cpt invariance we compare the masses of the positively and negatively charged @xmath0 leptons . the pseudomass method @xmath66 allows a separate measurement for the positive and the negative @xmath0 lepton , whereas the @xmath70 method implicitly assumes the two masses to be identical and",

    "the measurement does not use any monte carlo simulation which reduces the systematic uncertainties .    for the cpt analysis the @xmath66 distributions",

    "the distributions of the positive or negative @xmath0 leptons are fitted subclass by subclass to fix the parameterizations .",
    "then all the distributions of the positive @xmath0 leptons are fitted simultaneously with the parameters fixed to the values from the first fit , allowing only for a common shift in mass @xmath109 .",
    "then negative @xmath0 leptons are fitted the same way with @xmath110 as the free parameter .",

    "we obtain the result @xmath111 .    in a @xmath0 pair event produced in @xmath112 collisions ,",
    "a mass difference between the positive and negative @xmath0 will also create a difference in energy between the two @xmath0 .",
    "although in principle this invalidates the assumption @xmath113 , this effect is numerically negligible .",
    "most sources of systematic errors affect the result for the positive and negative lepton in the same way , so that their contributions cancel .",
    "the largest error in the mass difference comes from possible differences in the calibration between positively and negatively charged tracks which is limited to less than by studying muon pairs .",
    "this implies a systematic uncertainty on the mass difference of .",

    "it is added in quadrature to the statistical error .",
    "the @xmath66 method uses the momentum and mass of the hadronic system measured from the curvature of the tracks in the magnetic field of the detector .",
    "these tracks originate mainly from pions with a small fraction coming from kaons .",
    "the charge and the charge to mass ratio of these particles have to be known in order to convert the observed curvature into a momentum measurement .",
    "however , without assuming cpt invariance , it is no longer obvious that the charge and mass are the same for positively and negatively charged pions would not spoil the measurement . only a difference between @xmath114 and @xmath115 is relevant . ] .",
    "experimentally , the relative pion mass difference has been measured to be @xmath116 which is below our sensitivity , but the pion charge difference has not been measured separately",
    ". however , the pion charges could be different due to a charge difference between the @xmath117 and the @xmath118 or because of charge non - conservation .",
    "a charge difference between @xmath114 and @xmath115 as large as would invalidate our measurement .",
    "this is the first test of cpt invariance with @xmath0 leptons .",
    "the result is @xmath119 + where @xmath120 is the charge - independent result from the previous section .",
    "this result implies that the relative @xmath0 mass difference is smaller than at the @xmath3 confidence level .",
    "we have measured the mass of the @xmath0 lepton from the pseudomass distributions of the hadronic @xmath0 decays recorded by the opal detector at lep and obtained a result of @xmath121 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
