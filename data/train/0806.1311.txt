    "recently , a large amount of diffuse x - ray data have been obtained by chandra , bepposax , suzaku and xmm - newton , giving a complex picture near the milky way center @xcite .",
    "the data indicates that there exists a high temperature ( @xmath1 kev ) hot gas near the milky way center .",
    "@xcite suggested that the existence of two - temperature components of the hot gas can explain the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "@xcite analysed the xmm - newton data to get 1 kev and 4 kev hot gas components in sgr a east , a supernova remnant located close to the milky way center .",
    "later @xcite used the data from chandra to model the temperature of the two components within 20 pc as 0.8 kev and 8 kev .",
    "the temperature of the soft component ( @xmath2 0.8 kev ) can be explained by 1 percent of kinetic energy by one supernova explosion in every 3000 years near the milky way center , corresponding to power @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , the high temperature of the hard component ( @xmath5 8 kev ) can not be explained satisfactorily .",
    "the power needed to sustain the high temperature is about @xmath6 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the emission of the hard component is distributed much more uniformly than the soft component and the intensity of the two components are correlated , which suggest that they are produced by related physical processes @xcite . in this article , we present a model to explain the two - temperature composition , as well as the high temperature and uniform emission of the hard component obtained by chandra within 20 pc .",
    "we assume that there are sterile neutrinos with rest mass @xmath7 kev in the deep galactic center and their decay photons continuously supply the energy of the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the sterile neutrino halo is located at the center of a 20-pc radius gas cloud which is heated by the decayed photons .",
    "most photons are absorbed near the center ( @xmath8 pc ) of milky way and the energy is subsequently transferred to the surrounding gas .",
    "the major heating mechanism is the bound - free collisions between the decay photons and the ions in the hot gas . in this optically thick region ,",
    "the hot gas particles are in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "the high metallicity of the gas , @xmath9 solar metallicity , enhances the heating rate of the gas and provides enough energy to sustain the high temperature of the hard component .",
    "the energy absorbed in the central region is transferred to the outside optically thin region ( @xmath10 pc ) by collisions among the electrons to share their energy ( collisional equilibrium ) .",
    "also , we assume that the soft and hard components are in equilibrium with different uniform temperatures and they are bounded hydrostatically .",
    "although the recent miniboone data challenges the lsnd result that suggests the existence of ev scale sterile neutrinos @xcite , more massive sterile neutrinos ( eg .",
    "kev ) may still exist .",
    "the fact that active neutrinos have rest mass implies that right - handed neutrinos should exist which may indeed be massive sterile neutrinos .",
    "the existence of the sterile neutrinos has been invoked to explain many phenomena such as reionization @xcite , missing mass @xcite and the high temperature of the hot gas in clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to discuss the consequences of the existence of massive sterile neutrinos , which may decay into light neutrinos and photons .    the existence of the small size kev sterile neutrino halo is first suggested by @xcite .",
    "the size of a self - gravitating degenerate sterile neutrino halo depends on @xmath11 and total mass @xmath12 : @xmath13 pc . including the contribution of the baryons",
    ", the size will be even smaller .",
    "the size of the sterile neutrino halo is upper bounded by @xmath14 pc @xcite .",
    "this size is very small compared to that of a galaxy and therefore the sterile neutrino halo will hide deeply inside the galactic center @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos may decay into active neutrinos and become a strong energy source to galaxies and clusters .",
    "the decays of kev order sterile neutrinos may also help to solve the cooling flow problem in clusters @xcite .",
    "the sterile neutrinos at the center will decay into active neutrinos with decay rate @xmath15 by the following process : @xmath16 we assume that the energy of decay photons @xmath17 is greater than 8 kev because the energy of each photon must be greater than the energy of each electron in the hot gas in order for the latter to gain energy from the photons @xcite .",
    "the decayed photons come from the volume emission of the entire sterile neutrino halo .",
    "the distribution of photon energy has a characteristic width determined by the fermi momentum of the sterile neutrinos @xmath18 , which is very small compared with the rest mass of the sterile neutrinos , @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we can approximate the photon spectrum as monochromatic with energy @xmath20 .",
    "since we have not detected any strong lines of such high energy photons from the milky way center , the optical depth for decayed photons must be much greater than 1 .",
    "therefore , the total energy emitted by the decayed photons must be equal to the total energy gained by the electrons ( @xmath21 erg s@xmath4 ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total number of sterile neutrinos , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the ionization potential and probability of photon absorption by @xmath26 type ions in the hot gas : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ratio of the number of @xmath26 type ions to the total number of ions at 0.8 kev temperature ( the number density of the soft component is about ten times more than that of the hard component if they are in equilibrium ) .",
    "the absorption cross section of the @xmath26 type ions is largest for h - like and he - like ions , which is given by @xcite : @xmath29~{\\rm cm^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fitted parameters of a particular @xmath26 type ion .",
    "the total effective cross section is @xmath34 .",
    "the metallicity @xmath35 near the milky way center can reach @xmath36 ( solar metallicity ) @xcite .",
    "the metal ions with the largest cross section include si ( @xmath37 ) , s ( @xmath38 ) , ar ( @xmath39 ) , ca ( @xmath40 ) and fe ( @xmath41 ) ( see table 1 ) @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath42 for other metals and @xmath43 s@xmath4 ( the best fit value that can solve the cooling flow problem ) @xcite , we can obtain @xmath23 and the total mass of the sterile neutrino halo ( @xmath44 ) by eq .",
    "( 2 ) for different @xmath20 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath12 obtained ( @xmath45 ) is far below the upper bound of the total mass near the milky way center ( @xmath46 ) @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     given this power input ( @xmath6 erg s@xmath4 ) , we can estimate the equilibrium temperature of the gas at the center of milky way .",
    "the ionizing photons are continuously supplied and the heating rate is quite constant as the decay of sterile neutrinos is a slow process ( half - life of order hubble time ) .",
    "the energy absorbed will then be transferred to the other gas particles mainly by conduction .",
    "the power loss by bremsstrahlung radiation of a hot gas with temperature @xmath47 is @xmath48 erg s@xmath4 @xmath49 , and the power by its adiabatic expansion is @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are pressure , volume , sound speed , adiabatic index of the hot gas and mean mass of the gas particles respectively .",
    "the energy loss due to bremsstrahlung is negligible , being only 0.3 percent of the adiabatic cooling @xcite .",
    "we can therefore solve for the equilibrium temperature of the gas using eq .",
    "the temperature maintained in this process is given by @xmath56 if @xmath57 erg s@xmath4 within @xmath58 pc , then @xmath59 kev .",
    "in fact , the situation is similar to energy absorption in x - ray emitting nebulae .",
    "however , in a normal x - ray nebula , the x - ray source is usually far away from the gas cloud , whereas in our model the source is located at the center of the gas cloud .",
    "furthermore , the energy absorption in a normal x - ray nebula is about @xmath60 erg s@xmath4 so that the temperature of the nebula is about ev order @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the energy absorption is @xmath6 erg s@xmath4 , which can maintain the temperature of the hard component at 8 kev .",
    "when the gas particles are in thermal equilibrium , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number density of the gas particles , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the heating and cooling rates respectively .",
    "it is possible to have multi - temperature components in the hot gas , because there may be more than one solutions ( @xmath65 ) satisfying eq .",
    "the criterion for stability of the solution is @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath51 are the mass density and pressure of the hot gas .",
    "since the relaxation time of electron - electron collisions is less than that of ion - electron collisions , the temperature of electrons @xmath68 may be different from the temperature of ions @xmath69 in general .",
    "the total heating rate inside the gas cloud ( @xmath70 pc ) is given by : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant that depends on the size of the region .",
    "the cooling rate of x - ray emitting hot gas by bremsstrahlung radiation is : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a constant , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the ionization energy and charge of the @xmath26 type ions respectively .",
    "since the entire gas cloud is optically thin for @xmath77 pc and heavy metal ions are concentrated at the central region @xcite , the bound - free absorption of the broad - band bremsstrahlung photons is suppressed ( @xmath78 ) in a large fraction of the volume of the cloud , so that most of the bremsstrahlung photons can escape the gas cloud easily .",
    "when the hot gas particles are in thermal equilibrium , @xmath79 , and the pressure is given by : @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "( 2 ) shows the relation between @xmath51 and @xmath68 by using the mean metallicity within 20 pc @xcite .",
    "we notice that for some values of @xmath51 there are two different values of @xmath68 . by putting the heating and cooling rates into eq .",
    "( 11 ) , we get the criterion for stable solutions : @xmath83 < \\sum_i \\sigma_{bf , i } \\left[a_i - t_e \\frac{da_i}{dt_i }   \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath84 .",
    "we impose a free parameter @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "we define @xmath87 and @xmath88 to be the expressions on the left and right hand sides of the inequality in eq .",
    "( 15 ) respectively . in fig .",
    "( 3 ) , we plot @xmath89 against @xmath68 for two values of @xmath85 . when @xmath90 and @xmath91 , 0.8 kev @xmath92 4 kev and 1.8 kev @xmath92 8 kev are unstable solutions respectively as @xmath93 .",
    "we also indicate the unstable regions in fig .",
    "( 3 ) , and we notice that a two - temperature phase may exist with @xmath94 kev and @xmath95 kev for @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "( 2 ) , we can see that if there are less large-@xmath97 metal ions ( especially iron ) in the hot gas , more hot gas particles will shift to the lower temperature phase and only one equilibrium solution may be obtained .",
    "clearly , our model can account for the two - temperature structure of the hot gas near the milky way center .",
    "to explain the origin of the hard component , @xcite make use of magnetic reconnection driven by the turbulence that supernovae generate in the interstellar medium .",
    "magnetic reconnection can heat the hot gas to @xmath98 . for @xmath99 @xmath49 , @xmath100 mg , @xmath101 kev .",
    "however there is not enough evidence to support whether this mechanism can maintain the high temperature of the hard component @xcite .    in our model",
    ", we have assumed that there exists a sterile neutrino halo with @xmath102 kev in the milky way center , which decay to emit @xmath54 with life - time of cosmological order .",
    "it provides a large amount of energy to the hot gas and maintains the extremely high temperature .",
    "the bound - free collisions provide enough energy to the two different temperature components and maintain their temperatures . at the same time , a stable two - temperature structure in the hot gas can be explained by this heating mechanism naturally .",
    "the uniform emission of the soft and hard components suggests that they may come from similar physical processes @xcite . in our model",
    ", both components indeed share the same source of energy - the 8 - 9 kev photons emitted by the decays of sterile neutrinos . in our model , the sterile neutrinos may not be the major component of dark matter .",
    "therefore , any bounds on @xmath11 assuming they are the major dark matter candidate does not constrain our model severely . the heating rate in the milky way center is time dependent as there is a decreasing number of sterile neutrinos . therefore , if two galaxies have similar chemical compositions , the heating rate is greater for the large redshift one , which has more particles in the higher temperature component .",
    "we therefore predict that the hard component of the x - rays would be stronger for large redshift and metal - rich galaxies .",
    "moreover , if a galaxy has lower metallicity , then only a single temperature component may be observed instead of two ( see fig .",
