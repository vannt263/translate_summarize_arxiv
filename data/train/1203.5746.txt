    "<S> copper - oxide high - temperature superconductors evolve from a mott insulator to the superconducting state through an unknown ` pseudogap ' phase . </S>",
    "<S> many competing order origins of the ` pseudogap ' have been proposed , some of which lead to a fermi surface ( fs ) reconstruction into hole - pocket and electron - pockets.@xcite hole - pockets are detected in many experiments . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the existence of electron pockets has been overlooked for the past twenty years and only recently has been proposed by hall - effect , quantum oscillation at high magnetic field , nernst and seebeck measurements.@xcite in particular , hall - effect measurements have revealed a negative sign in the low - temperature hall coefficients which is taken as a signature of electron - like quasiparticles on the fs.@xcite the hall - coefficient in fact changes sign from negative to positive with increasing temperature but below @xmath1 , suggesting the coexistence of both electron and hole - pockets on the fs . </S>",
    "<S> shubnikov - de - haas ( sdh ) experiments in yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 and yba@xmath2cu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( ybco ) also argue for the presence of closed fs pockets,@xcite with slope suggestive of electron - pockets.@xcite this observation received further supports from the nernst and seebeck measurements which have been shown theoretically to be consistent with the coexistence of electron and hole - pockets.@xcite the question arises , _ if an electron pocket is present on the fs , are there spectroscopic fingerprints that can detect it directly ? _ for example , arpes which directly measures the single - particle spectral weight , has so far been unable to convincingly separate out the presence of an electron - pocket from a full paramagnetic fs .    </S>",
    "<S> many theoretical proposals have been put forward to explain the fs topology in cuprates,@xcite however , a consistent picture to describe both the bulk measurements and the spectroscopies has yet not been achieved . within a strong coupling scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the holes , doped into the parent mott insulator , create in - gap states at the fermi level without a well defined quasiparticle dispersion.@xcite again in the pre - formed sc pairing theory of the ` pseudogap ' , one would predict that a single large hole - like fs persists at all dopings , with sc fluctuations suppressing spectral weight in the antinodal regions , leaving a fermi arc.@xcite such a model would predict a hole - like sign of the hall coefficient at all temperatures,@xcite incompatible with the observed sign changing hall - effect@xcite and nernst and seebeck measurements.@xcite an alternative approach using a density wave picture of the pseudogap has been successful in explaining many aspects like the behavior of quantum oscillations , hall , nernst and seebeck effects,@xcite and arpes , stm and neutron scattering.@xcite of course , in ybco there are other band - structure properties that can serve as electron - like fs.@xcite    to find signatures of electron pockets , we model the pseudogap as a spin - density wave ( sdw ) state which leads to the fs reconstruction into hole and electron pockets.@xcite . using this model </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ( i ) the qpi pattern seen in stm exhibits 7 new @xmath7vectors which evolve in a qualitatively different way than the ones expected for a hole - pocket ; ( ii ) similarly , the ins measurements also display an additional resonance peak in the spin - excitation spectrum in the sc state coming from the electron - pocket ; ( iii ) furthermore , in some doping regions arpes fs spectral weight data reveal two peaks at the nodal and antinodal points with a dip between them which suggests reconstruction of the fs into hole and electron pockets , respectively ; ( iv ) we also demonstrate several key properties of these three spectroscopies which quantitatively and unambiguously can establish the presence of an electron - pocket on the fs .    the development of electron pocket in hole doped cuprates is doping ( and material ) dependent . in the overdoped region , </S>",
    "<S> the fs consists of a large hole - like fs centered at @xmath8 . at strong underdoping , a pseudogap opens in the region of momentum space near @xmath9 and @xmath10 , leaving a hole - pocket or ` fermi arc ' at the nodal point @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> these hole pockets are observed directly by arpes and are consistent with stm and many other experiments . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing doping , as the pseudogap correlation weakens but remains finite , the bottom of the conduction band at @xmath9 and @xmath10 drops down below the fermi level producing an electron pocket at some critical doping , even without the application of any external magnetic field ( see appendix  [ app1 ] for the details of the evolution of the fs ) . </S>",
    "<S> a small gap persists in the regions where the bare fs crosses the magnetic brillouin zone [ marked by a dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> as the electron - pockets are expected to form in the doping range where the fs crosses over from small pocket to large fs , spectroscopies need guidance to distinguish a pocket from a full hole - like fs . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we provide a careful analysis of the spectroscopic details to illustrate how to observe the electron - pocket .    in the superconducting state , the @xmath12wave pairing restricts the coherent bogoliubov quasiparticles to move on the @xmath13space of the electron and hole pockets , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering process of these particle - hole excitations leads to many observable features , like the elastic scatterings of the cooper pairs seen as a qpi pattern in stm.@xcite similarly , inelastic scattering between particle and hole bogoliubov quasiparticles leads to a scattering profile as revealed by ins.@xcite the qpi and ins patterns generated by the hole - pocket are well studied in cuprates.@xcite here we study how these patterns evolve naturally to include contributions of the electron pocket .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](b ) and [ fig1](c ) contrast the qpi patterns at two representative quasiparticle energies at which the cooper pair resides on the hole - pocket ( lower energy ) and electron pocket ( higher energy ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there is a qualitative difference in the overall qpi pattern at these two energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> first , since scattering is purely elastic , appearance of an electron pocket leads to new features in qpi that correspond to 7 additional electron - electron scattering @xmath15 vectors in addition to hole - hole scattering @xmath16 vectors . </S>",
    "<S> no elastic scattering features connect electron and hole pockets as they have different quasiparticle energies . </S>",
    "<S> the definitive distinction between the two pockets can be marked by the values of two high symmetry vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 connects equivalent energy points on two hole - pockets along the diagonal direction . as the hole - pocket terminates at the magnetic zone boundary at which @xmath20 , therefore , if @xmath21 continues to grow above @xmath22 , it must come from the electron pocket . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath23 [ along the ( 100)-direction ] will attain its maximum value equal to the reciprocal lattice vector of @xmath24 and @xmath25 at the highest energy of the qpi pattern .    in addtion , </S>",
    "<S> one requires to pay attention to the energy dependence of the qpi vectors as well as their associated intensities . due to the van - hove singularity at the antinodal point as well as the discontinuous jump from the hole - pocket to the electron - pocket fs , </S>",
    "<S> one expects a ` kink ' in the energy dependence of each qpi vector , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) and [ fig1](e ) . as the @xmath16 vectors reach the top of the hole - pocket [ i.e. when @xmath26 , the bogoluybov scattering of these vectors vanishes and they become merely fs nesting . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , all @xmath16 vectors shoot almost vertically upward but with diminishing intensity . nearly at the same energy , the bogolyubov scattering on the electron pocket turns on and @xmath15 vectors appear on the qpi pattern . unlike @xmath16s , @xmath15s </S>",
    "<S> disperse slowly with energy but the associated intensity begins to rise again . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , not only the magnitude of the @xmath15 vectors as discussed above , but also the expected ` kink ' in their dispersion and their associated intensity will serve as quantitative and unambiguous marks for the presence of electron - pockets .    to demonstrate how the electron - pocket leads to a different set of qpi patterns , we calculate the qpi spectra in a coexisting uniform phase of sdw induced pseudogap and @xmath12wave superconductivity.@xcite we concentrate on ybco@xmath27 where the band dispersion is obtained by the tight - binding fitting to the first - principle calculations . </S>",
    "<S> based on this ground state , the self - energy correction due to spin and charge fluctuations is computed within a self - consistent @xmath28-model [ see appendix  [ app1]].@xcite the lifetime broadening due to the imaginary part of the self - energy helps create ` bright - spots ' on the constant energy single - particle spectra . at any energy in the sc state , we have 8 ` bright spots ' due to @xmath12wave symmetry as shown in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> the locus of the ` bright - spot ' is always restricted to move on the normal state fs and takes the form of well - known ` banana - shape ' in the low - energy region ( on the ` hole - pocket ' ) ; see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](f1 ) and [ fig2](f2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the ` bright - spots ' hit the magnetic zone boundary [ green dashed line ] , they move to the electron - pocket region , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](g1 ) and [ fig2](g2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the qpi pattern as a convolution of the constant energy single particle spectra @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 single particle green s function in the sdw - sc state , see appendix  [ appqpi ] . at @xmath29 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 </S>",

    "<S> a similar linear dispersion is evident in the behavior of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 starts from @xmath38 at @xmath29 and increases to a maximum value less than @xmath22 in all underdoped cuprates while @xmath39 starts at a finite vector slightly below @xmath22 and reaches @xmath22 at the edge of the hole pocket . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting two dimensional qpi pattern in this energy scale is shown in figs .  [ fig2](d1 ) and [ fig2](d2 ) , and agrees qualitatively with the experimental results of bi2212.@xcite above this energy , all @xmath16 vectors become normal - state fs nesting , which is not related to the bogoliybov scattering , and bend backward with much less dispersion while the associated intensity gradually diminishes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the absence of an electron pocket , one can expect the qpi pattern to remain very much same as a function of energy but with much broadened peaks due to the lack of bogolyubov coherence peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the other weak - intensities apart from the leading 7 @xmath0-vectors are associated with the shadow bands , which are not relevant for the present study .    </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting feature of the qpi happens above the pseudogap energy scale which separates the electron pocket from the hole pocket . </S>",
    "<S> new @xmath7vectors develop due to the bogoluibov scattering of the electron pocket . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath15 vectors are practically the continuation of the @xmath16s above the magnetic zone boundary but with different slope and intensity which are related to the curvature of the electron pocket and the associated van - hove singularity . </S>",

    "<S> also , @xmath43 approach @xmath44 and its equivalent @xmath45-points . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the most robust features signaling the presence of the electron pocket will be the values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 in that @xmath48 at the beginning of electron pocket whereas @xmath47 reach the zone boundary ( @xmath49 [ and its equivalent points ] at the top of the electron - pocket .    </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of each @xmath16 and @xmath15 vector follows closely to the density of states ( doss ) as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> both the dos and the qpi intensity grow linearly with @xmath35 , demonstrating @xmath50-wave pairing symmetry and the particle - hole symmetry in the bogoliubov quasiparticles even in the pseudogap state and also under the influence of many - body effects . above the tip of the hole - pocket , the intensity drops in the pseudogap energy region and then it rises again sharply up to the tip of the electron pocket . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , to differentiate an electron pocket from a paramagnetic full fs , one needs to pay attention to the break in the slope of the qpi vectors going from the hole - pocket to the electron pocket . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) for constant energy scans , the qpi profile becomes essentially energy independent above the tip of the hole - pocket ; for example , when @xmath51 stops dispersing . </S>",

    "<S> in the sc state , @xmath58 arises from the inelastic scattering of the cooper pairs ( many body effects which are incorporated in the random - phase approximation shift the energy scale of the spectra to a slightly lower energy ; nevertheless the overall shape of the spectrum is not greatly changed ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the spectrum is dominated by scattering by bright spots , similar to qpi but connecting features above and below the fermi level . among 7 @xmath59 vectors in the qpi pattern discussed above only four vectors </S>",
    "<S> participate in the ins spectra , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) . furthermore , owing to the selection rule associated with elastic scatterings in stm , @xmath16 and @xmath15 are always energy resolved . </S>",
    "<S> but in the ins spectra the separation between the two energy scales becomes obscured due to the turning on of inter pocket inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the corresponding electron to hole pocket scattering channel by @xmath60 as shown by dashed lines of the same color in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the resulting constant energy ins profile in the sc region is sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the energy and momentum conservation principles associated with the inelastic bogoliubov quasiparticle scattering , the coherence factors of both the superconducting state and sdw state play a major role here.@xcite the sign change of the superconducting order at the ` hot - spot ' @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath61 , is a crucial for finding non - vanishing contributions to the ins spectra . </S>",
    "<S> sdw order with a modulation vector @xmath62 provides an additional coherence factor which leads to a gradual increase of intensity of the ins spectra as @xmath0 approaches @xmath63 .    in the hole pocket region </S>",
    "<S> , our calculation correctly reproduces the magnetic resonance peak at @xmath64 ( magenta arrows in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](e ) ,  [ fig3](f ) and [ fig3](g ) and both the downward and upward dispersions of the ` hour - glass ' pattern.@xcite below the resonance , the magnetic scattering of the cooper pairs also yields the maximum intensity in the bond direction , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the ins intensity maxima rotate by 45@xmath65 towards the diagonal direction above the resonance energy , again consistent with the hourglass phenomenology .    in the presence of the electron pocket , </S>",
    "<S> the ins pattern exhibits several distinguishing characteristics which can be separated from the usual hourglass pattern of the hole - pocket : ( 1 ) the intensity profile in the constant energy surface hosts peaks both along the bond direction as well as along the diagonal direction above the @xmath22-resonance , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](d1 ) , [ fig3](d2 ) and [ fig3](d3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) an additional resonance energy @xmath66 is observed along the bond direction in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3](g ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of two resonances is also theoretically calculated for iron - pnictide superconductors , although the the differences in the fs topology and the pairing symmetry between these two classes of superconductors make the details of the resonance spectra look very different.@xcite ( 3 ) more resonance branches appear in the ins spectra although weak in intensity , in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](f1 ) ,  [ fig3](f2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results of ybco@xmath27 shows clear evidence for the second peak as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](e ) and [ fig3](g ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy scale of both the resonances are set by the sc gap amplitude as @xmath67 where @xmath68/2 $ ] is the structure factor of the @xmath69wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the arpes value of sc gap magnitude @xmath70  mev from refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two energy scales are determined by the position of the corresponding ` hot - spot ' momentum value on the fs . </S>",
    "<S> the first resonance occurs at @xmath63 where the @xmath39 vector connects the ` bright - spots ' at the tip of the hole pocket which gives @xmath71mev . </S>",
    "<S> the second resonance occurs when @xmath72 touches the brillouin zone boundary which yields @xmath73mev . </S>",
    "<S> note that in our calculation , the two spin resonance energies have a direct relation to the peaks in the qpi , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) , where the spin resonance peak occurs at twice the energy of the peak in the qpi intensity .    </S>",
    "<S> * angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy- * the same information on the presence of the electron pocket can be directly obtained from arpes . </S>",
    "<S> arpes measures the single particle spectral weight @xmath74 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , we provide some evidence for the presence of the electron pockets in the arpes data .    in the strongly underdoped cuprates where the pseudogap is large , it gaps out the whole antinodal region above the magnetic zone boundary . </S>",
    "<S> thus electron pockets disappear from the fs and only the hole - pocket is present , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that even in the theoretical spectra , there is a finite incoherent spectral weight present away from the hole - pocket which traces the underlying ungapped fs . </S>",
    "<S> this is the effect of the imaginary part of the self - energy correction which is calculated to be quasi - linear in the low - energy region . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the residual spectral weight gradually decreases from the nodal to the antinodal regions as the pseudogap grows along the same direction but spreads over a larger energy and momentum region . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with experiment in a deeply underdoped sample of lsco as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) .    therefore , in order to identify the electron pocket at the antinodal point , one needs to pay attention to the spectral weight . in the near - optimal region close to the quantum critical point </S>",
    "<S> , the electron pocket appears at the fermi level , leading to coherent spectral weight at the antinodal point as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the experimental data for dopings @xmath75 of lsco in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](d)-[fig4](e ) and in an overdoped sample of tbco in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](f ) , we see that both the hole and the electron pockets are present in this doping range . especially , the spectral weight maps of the fs in figs .  [ fig4](d ) and [ fig4](f ) have peaks of comparable magnitude at both nodal point and antinodal point while it is suppressed in between these two points . in the case of an ungapped full fs , the spectral weight is expected to be coherent and similar at each fermi momentum , whereas as discussed above , when only a hole pocket is present the spectral weight gradually decreases from the nodal point to the antinodal point . therefore , the experimental results in figs .  [ fig4](d)-[fig4](f ) convincingly establish the presence of the electron pocket in the vicinity of optimal doping for these two materials .    the procedure of inverting the qpi data to reconstruct the single - particle fs is well known@xcite and following the conventional procedure , we find that the fs constructed from the experimental data of qpi maps used in fig .  [ fig2 ] lies reasonably on top of the theoretical data . </S>",
    "<S> note that the existing experimental data has not yet been analyzed with the notion to identify the electron pocket . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we extract the fs from the ins data of ybco shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] and the result agrees well with the picture of coexisting hole and electron pockets as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we comment on the difficulties of arpes to observe the electron pocket . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned earlier , electron - pockets are expected near the quantum critical point of the pseudogap at which the sc gap still survives . in this doping region </S>",
    "<S> , a typical phase diagram shows that the pseudogap transition temperature @xmath76 for most of the cuprates.@xcite furthermore , in the sc state , the electron pockets , being positioned at the antinodal point are fully gapped by @xmath12wave superconductivity and therefore , arpes can not detect it . when temperature is increased above @xmath77 to close the sc gap , the small pseudogaps are also nearly closed , so the hole pocket and electron pocket disappears , and a full metallic fs forms . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> quantum oscillations are performed in high magnetic fields at which superconductivity is suppressed , and the electron pocket becomes exposed . </S>",
    "<S> additional complications can arise since arpes and stm are sensitive to the surface states as well as to so - called ` matrix - element ' effects , which could also explain failure to see certain portions of the fs at particular experimental conditions .    in conclusion , we present the detailed spectroscopic analysis of the electron pocket that will allow both single particle ( arpes ) and two particle spectroscopies ( stm and ins ) to detect electron pockets that are posited to be present near optimal doping . </S>",
    "<S> these simple qualitative features provide a sharp contrast to a simple hole pocket models and hence offer a direct test of their presence . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest model that has electron pockets is the sdw state with or without coexisting superconducting order . </S>",
    "<S> even with this simplified model we find significant spectroscopic features that allow qualitative and quantitative determination of the electron pockets in cuprates . </S>"
