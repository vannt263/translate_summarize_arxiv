    "we mean simply that the hamiltonian can be expressed as a linear combination of operators belonging to a finite - dimensional lie algebra with @xmath5 basic elements .",
    "the parameters , @xmath6 , of the respective lie group satisfy to a set of @xmath5 first - order ordinary differential nonlinear equations which depend only on the structure of the algebra and on @xmath7-number coefficients of the system s hamiltonian or the other governing operator @xcite .",
    "thus , the dynamical group itself may be considered as a dynamical system .",
    "the dynamical - symmetry and lie - algebraic approach has been successfully applied to describe the time evolution of numerous physical systems in different disciplines extending from classical mechanics @xcite , classical optics @xcite and quantum mechanics @xcite to physics of neutrino oscillations @xcite . as to study of dynamics of laser driven atoms , this approach has been applied to get lie algebraic solution of the bloch equations @xcite .",
    "the evolution of an isolated quantum system is regular , and the overlap of any two different quantum state vectors is a constant in course of time .",
    "all the expectation values of the quantum variables evolve in a quasiperiodic way at most .",
    "it does no matter how complicated is a dynamical symmetry of the quantum system under consideration and the corresponding lie algebra . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that even simple classical systems may be unstable and demonstrate chaotic behavior @xcite .",
    "classical instability is usually defined as an exponential separation of two initially close trajectories in time with an asymptotic rate given by the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath8 .",
    "such a behavior is possible because of the continuity of the classical phase space where the system s states can be arbitrary close to each other .",
    "the trajectory concept is absent in quantum mechanics , and the quantum phase space is not continuous due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "perfectly isolated quantum systems are unitary , and there can be no chaos in the sense of exponential instability even if their classical limits are chaotic .",
    "what is usually understood under quantum chaos is , in essence , the special features of the quantum unitary evolution of the system under consideration ( no matter how complicated the evolution is ) in the region of its control parameter values and/or initial conditions at which its classical analogue is chaotic @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is not a special quantum problem .",
    "any type of propagating waves ( electromagnetic , sound or others ) , satisfying to a linear wave equation ( which is an analogue of the scrodinger equation ) , has the same property .",
    "wave chaos is the special features of the wave field in the region of control parameters and/or initial conditions at which its ray analogue is chaotic @xcite .",

    "let us describe briefly the interconnection between the dynamical symmetries and dynamical chaos in physics of the atom - field interaction .    1 .",
    "the simplest problem is dynamics of a two - level atom at rest in an external laser field . from the dynamical symmetry point of view , the @xmath0 group , generated by the corresponding hamiltonian , is driven by an external force that is not considered to be a dynamical system .",
    "it is the case of an external driving .",
    "the problem has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where it has been shown that the evolution of atomic internal variables in a linearly polarized bichromatic laser field with incommensurate frequencies may be very complicated on the bloch sphere albeit regular .",
    "it is simply because the dynamics takes place on the two - dimensional surface of the bloch sphere .",
    "2 .   if we deal with a two - level atom at rest in an ideal cavity and take into account the response of the atom to the cavity radiation field , the semiclassical evolution of the coupled atom - field system may be chaotic in the sense of exponential sensitivity to small variations in initial conditions and/or parameters @xcite .",
    "this is the case of so - called dynamical driving @xcite when the @xmath0 group , generated by the atomic hamiltonian , is driven by another dynamical system , the field one .",
    "we deal now with a quantum system , the atom , which is coupled with a classical system , the radiation field governed by the maxwell equations .",
    "the resulting maxwell - scrodinger ( bloch ) equations constitute the five - dimensional set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with two integrals of motion , the total atom - field energy ( which is a constant in the absence of any losses ) and the length of the bloch vector .",
    "the motion in the phase space takes place on a three - dimensional manifold and may be chaotic due to transverse intersection of stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic points in some ranges of the control parameters , the values of the maximal rabi frequency and the coupling strength @xcite .",
    "if a two - level atom moves within a standing - wave laser field in an open space , not in a cavity , the field may be considered as an external driving but one needs to take into account the atomic recoil effect , i.e. changes of the atomic momentum after absorption or emission photons .",
    "if the atom is not especially cold , we may treat its translation degree of freedom classically .",
    "it is again the case of the dynamical driving with the @xmath0 group driven by the dynamical system which is now the classical atomic degree of freedom .",

    "a number of nonlinear dynamical effects have been analytically and numerically demonstrated with this system : chaotic rabi oscillations @xcite , hamiltonian chaotic atomic transport and dynamical fractals @xcite , lvy flights and anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "these effects are caused by local instability of the center - of - mass motion in a laser field .",
    "a set of atomic trajectories under certain conditions becomes exponentially sensitive to small variations in initial quantum internal and classical external states or / and in the control parameters , mainly , the atom - laser detuning .",

    "the other possibility is a nanofabrication where the atoms after the interaction with the standing wave are deposited on a silicon substrate in a high vacuum chamber . in this case",
    "the spatial distribution can be analyzed with an atomic force microscope .",
    "the modern tools of atom optics enable to create narrow initial atomic distributions in position and momentum , reduce coupling to the environment and technical noise , create one - dimensional optical potentials , and to measure spatial and momentum distributions with high sensitivity and accuracy @xcite .",
    "the results obtained can be applied to other models of the atom - field interaction as well . in particular ,",
    "relaxation processes in two - level atoms can be described within the framework of the @xmath138 dynamical - symmetry approach to solving the bloch equations @xcite .",
    "moreover , one may consider by the method developed in this paper the dynamics not only of two - level atoms but of three- , four- and multilevel atoms excited by a few laser fields at different atomic transitions .",
    "if the corresponding model hamiltonian has the @xmath0 dynamical symmetry , then one may use the solution obtained in sec .",
    "2 that is valid for any representation of the @xmath0 group .",
    "the model considered can be generalized to the case with two - level atoms inside a high - quality cavity with a quantized field . in the rotating wave approximation",
    "the state space of the corresponding jaynes - cummings model splits up into an infinite class of two - dimensional non - communicating subspaces each of which being labeled by eigenvalues of the casimir operator .",
    "the system evolves in such a way that transitions between the subspaces with different eigenvalues are forbidden .",
    "the solution for the time - evolution operator in each of these subspaces is given by the matrix ( [ 23 ] ) with the group parameter satisfying to the equation similar to ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the resulting equations of motion for the coupled atom - field system are expected to constitute an infinite - dimensional set of the type ( [ mainsys ] ) with the group equation ( [ 23 ] ) acting in each of the subspaces labeled by its own eigenvalue .",
    "this set is expected to admit very different regimes of motion including chaotic ones .",
