    "extensions of the standard model ( sm ) with extra dimensions offer new ways to accommodate the hierarchies observed in particle physics @xcite . a very attractive possibility would be to bring the scale of unification with gravity from @xmath1 gev down to the electroweak scale @xmath2 tev .",
    "this could result if gravity propagates along a ( 4+@xmath3)dimensional ( d ) flat space with @xmath3 compact submillimeter dimensions ( add model @xcite ) or along a ( 4 + 1)d slice of anti - desitter space with a warp factor in the metric ( rs model @xcite ) . these higher dimensional field theories , however , must be considered effective low - energy limits only valid below the mass scale of a more fundamental theory . and nowadays , only string theory @xcite provides a consistent framework for the unification of gravity with the standard model .    at energies",
    "where the effects of a higher dimensional graviton are unsuppressed one expects the presence of its string regge ( sr ) excitations giving an effect of the same size .",
    "this will be necessary in order to avoid the pathologies of spin-2 field theories .",
    "in string theory the massless graviton comes as the zero mode of a closed string , whereas the gauge bosons are the lightest modes of an open string .",
    "now , as emphasized in @xcite , the exchange amplitude of a closed string has an order @xmath4 suppression versus the exchange of an open string . in consequence , processes that receive sizeable contributions from sr and kaluza - klein excitations of the graviton and also from sr excitations of the gauge bosons will be dominated by the second ones .",
    "this seems to be a generic feature in models of higher dimensional gravity embedded in a weakly - coupled string theory .    in this paper",
    "we explore some phenomenological consequences of the theories with unification at the tev .",
    "in particular , we focus on the neutrino - nucleon cross section . our interest is based on the possibility that new neutrino physics could explain the cosmic ray events above the gzk cutoff energy ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we discuss a genuine string effect , the presence of leptoquarks that mediate the process in the @xmath0 and/or the @xmath5channel .",
    "this fact is a generic consequence required by the duality of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the leptoquarks appear at the massive sr level even in string models where the only massless modes are the sm fields ( string models with the sm gauge symmetry ) .",
    "the impact of leptoquarks on the neutrino - nucleon cross section at ultra - high energies was first studied in @xcite , whereas in @xcite they are proposed in a framework of strongly interacting neutrinos .",
    "cullen , perelstein and peskin build in ref .",
    "@xcite a tev - string model for qed . it contains electrons and photons at low energies and massive sr excitations above the string scale .",
    "these excitations give corrections to qed processes that can be easily calculated . in this section",
    "we generalize their results in order to obtain the @xmath6 string amplitude .",
    "the model results from a simple embedding of the sm interactions into type iib string theory . it is assumed that the 10d space of the theory has 6 dimensions compactified on a torus with common periodicity @xmath7 ( the case with 6 extra dimensions tends to alleviate the graviphoton problem @xcite ) , and that @xmath8 coincident d3-branes ( 4d hypersurfaces where open strings may end ) are stretched out in the 4 extended dimensions .",
    "we also assume that the extra symmetry of the massless string modes can be eliminated by an appropriate orbifold projection , resulting an acceptable model with ( at least ) the sm fields .",
    "the parameters of this theory would be the string scale @xmath9 tev and the dimensionless gauge coupling contant @xmath10 , unified at @xmath11 .",
    "proposals for splitting these couplings can be found in @xcite . for more general d - brane models",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a tree - level amplitude of open string states on a d - brane is given @xcite as a sum of ordered amplitudes multiplied by chan - paton traces .",
    "for the process under study we have @xmath12 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & g^2 \\cdot \\s(s , u ) \\cdot f^{1234}(s , u , t ) \\cdot   \\tr [ t^1t^2t^3t^4+t^4t^3t^2t^1 ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & g^2 \\cdot \\s(t , u ) \\cdot f^{1324}(t , u , s ) \\cdot   \\tr [ t^1t^3t^2t^4+t^4t^2t^3t^1 ] \\ , . \\label{string0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath13 is basically the veneziano amplitude @xcite , @xmath14 label @xmath15 , the chan - paton factors @xmath16 are representation matrices of @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a factor depending on the vertex operators for the external states and their ordering . in our case",
    "all the vertex operators will correspond to ( massless ) weyl spinors of helicity ( directed inward ) @xmath19 or @xmath20 , giving @xmath21 we obtain @xmath22 \\ , , \\label{ampl0}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 the chan - paton traces .    to understand the phenomenological consequences of this amplitude",
    "let us start with the limit @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath25 , we have all the veneziano factors @xmath26 .",
    "the amplitude expresses then the exchange of massless vector modes in the @xmath27 and the @xmath5channels .",
    "the former would correspond to the @xmath28 gauge boson , whereas the field exchanged in the @xmath5channel is in the @xmath29 and/or the @xmath30 representations of @xmath31 and has electric charge @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33-singlet can be found in the @xmath34 of @xmath35 or the adjoint @xmath36 of @xmath37 , whereas the triplet is , for example , in the @xmath38 of @xmath35 .",
    "we are interested , however , in models that reproduce the sm result at low energies , with no massless leptoquarks .",
    "we obtain this limit if the chan - paton factors assigned to @xmath39 and @xmath40 are such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where we have used @xmath43 . in terms of @xmath44",
    "the amplitude becomes @xmath45   + { s\\over u } \\left [ a\\ ; \\s(s , u ) -   a\\ ; \\s(t , u ) \\right ] \\;\\right ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{ampl1}\\ ] ] at low @xmath0 this amplitude is @xmath46 and corresponds to the exchange of a @xmath28 boson in the @xmath27channel . the @xmath28 is then a massless sr mode that will acquire its mass @xmath47 only through the higgs mechanism .",
    "we shall neglect the corrections of order @xmath48 that may affect the massive sr modes .    as the energy increases the veneziano factor @xmath49 gives a series of poles ( at @xmath50 ) and zeroes ( at @xmath51 ) .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath52 at @xmath53 the amplitude will describe the exchange of a collection of resonances with the same mass and different spin ( see below ) . away from the poles",
    "the interference of resonances at different mass levels will produce the usual soft ( regge ) behavior of the string in the ultraviolet .",
    "obviously , these resonances are not stable and at one loop will get an imaginary part in their propagator . when the total width of a resonance ( which grows with its mass ) is similar to the mass difference with the resonance in the next level one can not see resonances and interference effects",
    "dominate also at @xmath53 .",
    "let us first analyze the case with @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ ampl1 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude is just @xmath55 . near the pole at @xmath53 it is @xmath56 this amplitude corresponds to the @xmath0channel exchange of massive leptoquarks in the @xmath57 representation of @xmath31 with electric charge @xmath58 . at each pole",
    "we have contributions of resonances with a common mass @xmath59 but different spin , going from zero to the order of the residue @xmath60 . in this case the maximum spin at the @xmath3 level is @xmath61 .",
    "to separate these contributions we first write the residue in terms of the scattering angle @xmath62 , with @xmath63",
    ". then we express @xmath64 as a linear combination of the @xmath65functions ( rotation matrix elements ) : @xmath66 the coefficient @xmath67 gives the contribution to our amplitude of a leptoquark @xmath68 of mass @xmath69 and spin @xmath70 .",
    "for example , at the first sr level we find a scalar resonance with @xmath71 , at @xmath72 there is a single vector resonance with @xmath73 , whereas at @xmath74 there are modes of spin @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the general case with @xmath79 is completely analogous , with resonant contributions from the terms proportional to @xmath49 and @xmath80 .",
    "taking @xmath81 and expressing again the residue in terms of @xmath65functions we find the same type of resonances but with different @xmath67 coefficients : @xmath82 , @xmath73 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "from the resonant amplitude @xmath86 we can now obtain the partial width @xmath87 : latexmath:[\\[\\gamma^j_n={g^2\\over 40\\pi}\\ ; { \\sqrt{n } m_s\\ ;     @xmath70 , the variation with @xmath3 of @xmath67 gives the _ running _ of the coupling with the energy .",
    "we obtain numerically that the coupling of heavier resonances decreases like the power law @xmath89 .",
    "the partial width @xmath90 can be used to obtain the cross section @xmath91 in the narrow - width approximation : @xmath92 at each mass level @xmath3 there is a tower of resonances of integer spin @xmath70 from 0 to @xmath93 . we find a sum rule for the production rate @xmath94 of any of these resonances : @xmath95 this is equivalent ( for @xmath54 ) to the production rate of a single resonance of mass @xmath96 and coupling @xmath97 @xcite . in our opinion",
    "this is a very interesting result .",
    "the coupling of heavier sr modes decreases quadratically with the energy , but the number of modes ( and the highest spin ) at each mass level @xmath3 grows also quadratically making @xmath98 a constant independent of @xmath3 .    in the narrow - width approximation @xmath99 is then @xmath100 . in this limit",
    "the cross section is proportional to a collection of delta functions and thus all interference effects are ignored .",
    "this is a good approximation as far as the total width of a resonance is smaller than the mass difference with the next resonance of same spin .",
    "although the coupling ( and any partial width ) decreases with the mass , the total width of heavier resonances will grow due to the larger number of decay modes that are kinematically allowed .",
    "we estimate that contributions to @xmath101 from modes beyond @xmath102 are a continuum . in this regime",
    "any cross section goes to zero exponentially at fixed angle ( @xmath0 large , @xmath103 fixed ) and like a power law at small angles ( @xmath0 large , @xmath27 fixed ) @xcite .",
    "we neglect these contributions .",
    "we will keep only resonant contributions from levels @xmath104 and will find that our result depends very mildly on the actual value of @xmath105 .    to evaluate the total @xmath85 cross section we shall also need the elastic amplitudes @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 takes the same form as the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ ampl1 ] ) with the changes @xmath111 .",
    "the massive resonances exchanged in the @xmath0channel are now an admixture of an @xmath33 singlet and a triplet .",
    "the singlet contribution is required in @xmath3-even levels , otherwise an @xmath33 gauge transformation would relate the parameters @xmath67 obtained here with the ones deduced from eq .",
    "( [ ampl1 ] ) . in @xmath3-odd mass levels gauge invariance could be obtained with no singlets for @xmath112 .",
    "the cross section @xmath113 can be read from eq .",
    "( [ cs1 ] ) just by changing @xmath114 .",
    "the calculation of amplitudes and cross sections for @xmath115 are completely analogous .",
    "we obtain @xmath116 the cross sections @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    "coincide with the expression in eq .",
    "( [ cs3 ] ) with the changes @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "for the left - handed antiquarks , @xmath123 and @xmath124 can be read from eq .",
    "( [ cs1 ] ) by changing @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "now the total neutrino - nucleon cross section due to the exchange of sr excitations can be very easily evaluated . in terms of parton distribution functions @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) in a nucleon @xmath129 and the fraction of longitudinal momentum @xmath130 , it is @xmath131 where @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 is the factor multiplying the delta function in the cross section @xmath135 .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot the neutrino - nucleon cross section at energies from @xmath136 to @xmath137 gev for @xmath138 tev .",
    "we have used the cteq5 parton distributions in the dis scheme @xcite extended to @xmath139 with the methods in @xcite .",
    "we include the sm cross section and plot the string corrections for @xmath140 equal 0 and 5 ( notice that in the first case there are no @xmath0channel resonances mediating the @xmath141 amplitude ) .",
    "we do not include the modes beyond @xmath142 , where we expect that the narrow width approximation is poor .",
    "we also find that around @xmath143 of the effect comes from the ten first sr modes .",
    "cosmic rays hit the nucleons in the atmosphere with energies of up to @xmath144 gev .",
    "if the string scale is in the tev range , these cosmic rays have the energy required to explore the fundamental theory and its interactions .",
    "in particular , ultra - high energy neutrinos are interesting since they can travel long distances without losing a significant fraction of energy . in addition , the sm interactions of a neutrino are much weaker than those of a quark or a charged lepton , which makes easier to see deviations due to new physics .    with this motivation we have analyzed the string @xmath85 cross section at energies much larger than @xmath145 tev .",
    "we fix the arbitrary parameters of the model ( four chan - paton traces ) imposing phenomenological constraints , namely , the massless sr modes must account for the electroweak gauge bosons only .",
    "then we find that the massive sr modes include leptoquarks that mediate the process in the @xmath0channel .",
    "the presence of massive leptoquarks is not a peculiarity of our toy model but a generic feature of any string model .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "if an amplitude is mediated by a massless field in the @xmath27channel , there will be its higher - spin sr excitations mediating the process also in the @xmath27channel . however , the only known way to make sense of an amplitude mediated by ( elementary ) higher spin fields is _  la _ veneziano ( open string ) @xcite or _  la _ virasoro ( closed string ) @xcite . in the first case the amplitude has @xmath146 and/or @xmath147 duality ( see _ e.g. _ eq .",
    "( [ ampl0 ] ) ) , whereas in the second case the amplitude has @xmath148 duality . in consequence ,",
    "any amplitude with @xmath27channel poles will also have @xmath0 and/or @xmath5channel poles .",
    "note that the @xmath5channel poles of @xmath149 become @xmath0channel poles of @xmath150 .",
    "we have found a very simple sum rule for the production rate of all the leptoquarks , with spin from 0 to @xmath151 , in the same mass level @xmath3 .",
    "this made possible the calculation of the total @xmath85 cross section in the narrow - width approximation .",
    "we obtain that the effect of these leptoquarks is not just a correction of order @xmath152 to the sm cross section , as one would expect on dimensional grounds .",
    "sr excitations give a contribution that can dominate for @xmath145 tev .",
    "this deviation ( see fig .  1 ) could explain the observation of horizontal air showers in upcoming cosmic ray experiments @xcite .",
    "however , for the expected flux of ultra - high energy neutrinos it seems unlikely that the cosmic ray events observed above the gzk limit correspond to the decay of resonances produced in @xmath85 scattering .",
    "if the primordial particle is a neutrino , the most promising possibility would be @xmath153 scattering in the galactic halo with the the resonant production of a @xmath28 boson @xcite or other massive field @xcite decaying into hadrons .",
