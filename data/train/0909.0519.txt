    "the possibility of using dark matter  @xcite to provide energetic positrons and electrons  @xcite to explain the gev positron excess  @xcite seen by pamela  @xcite , the `` atic bump ''  @xcite , and the less - anomalous @xmath0 spectra measured by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( hereafter , fermi )  @xcite and hess  @xcite ( in lieu of a nearby pulsar  @xcite ) has sparked considerable interest ( e.g. , @xcite ) . generating the required @xmath1 flux through annihilations in the smooth component of the milky way s dark matter halo requires both a much larger annihilation cross section than might be expected for a thermal relic @xcite and a large branching ratio to charged leptons .",
    "a variety of constraints ( e.g. , @xcite ) already apply to a smooth halo explanation , and will likely tighten with new data from fermi  @xcite .",
    "we examine the observational consequences of annihilations occurring within the dark matter substructure of the milky way .",
    "substructure differs from the smooth halo in its spatial distribution , which is less centrally - concentrated  @xcite , and in its characteristic velocity dispersions , which are colder .",
    "we focus on the case of enhanced annihilation to charged leptons in `` sommerfeld '' models , in which the annihilation cross section increases with decreasing relative velocity , and consider scenarios with a velocity - independent cross section .",
    "annihilations to charged particles necessarily produce internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) gamma rays @xcite .",
    "high - energy electrons and positrons will also produce gamma rays through various energy - loss processes .",
    "beyond a few tens of kiloparsecs from the galactic center , the dominant loss process for electrons is the inverse - compton ( ic ) upscattering of cmb photons .",
    "we calculate the expected high - latitude gamma - ray emission from ib and ic resulting from dark matter annihilation in substructure throughout the milky way .",
    "in particular , rather than considering only the serendipitous presence of a single , nearby , massive dark matter clump  @xcite , we account for the collective emission from the entire subhalo population . noting that electron- and gamma - ray - induced showers are difficult to distinguish in air cherenkov telescopes , we discuss how constraints on tev gamma - ray fluxes can be obtained from the cosmic - ray electron measurements made by hess to limit annihilations to lepton pairs via their ib emission .",
    "to describe their structural properties , we assume each individual dark matter subhalo to be described by a nfw density profile  @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a scale radius and @xmath4 a characteristic density . the differential luminosity ( photons or particles per energy per time ) @xmath5 of a subhalo , for an annihilation cross section @xmath6 that is independent of velocity , is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the subhalo mass , @xmath9 is the concentration , @xmath10 , and the particle physics - dependence of the annihilation rate is isolated in @xmath11 with @xmath12 the dark matter particle mass and @xmath13 the particle spectrum produced per annihilation .",
    "numerical simulations find a relation between concentration and mass for subhalos that varies as a function of distance from the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "this is a natural consequence of tidal stripping , which more effectively removes mass from the outer regions of the subhalos while leaving the core relatively unscathed .",

    "a challenge in attributing the positron excess to dark matter annihilation is the need for a much larger annihilation cross section than expected for a thermal relic .",
    "one way to accomplish this is by introducing a scalar or vector boson that mediates an intermediate - range force between dark matter particles and can dramatically enhance the cross section for annihilation at low relative velocities ( see sommerfeld  @xcite for electromagnetic scattering ) . for dark matter , this can be through standard model gauge bosons ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a new mediator particle ( @xmath50 )  @xcite .",
    "we examine the possibility that annihilations in substructure , rather than in the smooth halo , are the dominant contributor to the measured local lepton flux and the astrophysical consequences that result . in this section ,",
    "we first show how this can arise for sommerfeld models , then proceed to properties valid in general .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement can be expressed by the factor @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the relative velocity of the dark matter particles and @xmath53 is the cross section in the absence of the additional force .",

    "the local annihilation rate per volume , @xmath69 , depends on the dark matter density and velocity dispersion at the solar circle .",
    "we normalize the 1-d velocity dispersion to the local rotation curve  @xcite , @xmath70  km  s@xmath71 , and take @xmath72 .",

    "[ fig : localratiores ] compares the local annihilation rates in the smooth halo and in substructure for a sommerfeld model with @xmath62 . for a significant region of the @xmath55 parameter space , particularly near resonances ,",

    "this approach breaks down due to the low number density of these subhalos , so that the presence of a nearby clump would have to be accounted for ( although having such within 1  kpc is unlikely  @xcite ) .",
    "including subhalos of all masses in the calculation of the local flux results in an overestimate of @xmath48 of not more than 25% relative to assuming a maximum mass of @xmath86 without accounting for a sommerfeld enhancement , and smaller in models with lower @xmath57 , a minor effect that we neglect .",

    "the mass function is normalized so that 15% ( 50% ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) of the host halo mass is in subhalos of @xmath96 to @xmath97 m@xmath98 .",
    "the range of @xmath94 in table  [ tab : subparams ] indicates that even in the absence of an enhancement arising primarily from sommerfeld effects substructure can contribute significantly to the local annihilation rate , and hence no more than a modest enhancement in the substructure rate is typically required for this component to be locally dominant ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "current cmb constraints  @xcite restrict the saturation cross section in sommerfeld models to within a factor of a few of the value required in order to explain the pamela and fermi data by annihilation in the smooth halo , consequently only models in which the subhalo contribution is no more than a factor of a few smaller than that of the smooth halo without sommerfeld enhancement could produce sufficient cosmic - ray fluxes without exceeding the allowed saturation cross section .",
    "clearly , this condition can be satisfied for plausible subhalo parameters , which is valid even for dark matter models with other means of obtaining an enhanced annihilation cross section .",
    "we proceed assuming that annihilation to charged leptons in substructure dominates over the smooth halo and accounts for 100% of the anomalous fluxes .",

    "far from the galactic disk , the most important loss channel is inverse - compton scattering on the cmb ( we neglect the cosmic ir background , which has energy density a few percent that of the cmb  @xcite ) , since the magnetic fields there should be small  @xcite and result in negligible synchrotron losses . to calculate the gamma - ray flux , we must first find the equilibrium @xmath0 spectrum .",

    "the electron cooling time is @xmath124  yr , so that even if electrons propagate rectilinearly , they would only travel a distance of order the virial radius of the milky way .",
    "this is likely an overestimate , since their propagation should be affected by the halo magnetic field , although its structure and strength is uncertain .",
    "considering the length scales relevant for electrons injected by annihilation in substructure , we make the simplifying assumption that this halo magnetic field results in the ic losses occurring near the injection point ( more care is needed for smooth halo signals due to the steeper gradient in particle injection with radius  @xcite ) . this reduces the problem to a continuity equation  @xcite @xmath125 = q(e)\\,,\\ ] ] which can be readily solved for a given injection spectrum . while ib signals may vary greatly between annihilation channels , essentially all models that remain viable post - fermi lead to nearly identical equilibrium electron spectra ( up to uncertainties in the astrophysical spectrum and propagation models )  @xcite . with generality ,",
    "we consider dark matter with @xmath126  tev annihilating into two @xmath127 pairs ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation proceeds similarly to  @xcite as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the local annihilation rate per volume ( matched to that required to agree with pamela / fermi ) and the resultant ic gamma - ray spectrum per annihilation , @xmath130 , is calculated using the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the inner galaxy , synchrotron and ic losses on optical / ir photon backgrounds would result in a broad range of secondary photons  @xcite .",

    "we have made no attempt to account for other astrophysical contributions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for blazars ) .",
    "the velocity - dependence of the annihilation cross section in sommerfeld models makes calculating the cosmic signal in this scenario more complicated than in the standard picture  @xcite .",
    "this requires moving beyond the assumption of a constant boost ( as in @xcite ) due to a dependence of the velocity dispersion and hence the cross section on halo mass .",
    "also , the effects of baryons on dark halos vary with mass , since low - mass halos likely were never able to retain gas to form stars , and even in halos containing dwarf galaxies dark matter governs dynamics in the inner regions  @xcite . although a detailed treatment of these matters is beyond our scope , a simple estimate based on the total annihilation rate within the milky way halo ( and scaling the amount of mass within substructure with host halo mass ) suggests that this could be a factor of a few larger than the ic flux from substructure in the milky way halo only ( as in fig .",
    "[ pbr ] ) with a similar spectral shape .",
    "we note that the scenarios assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite are fundamentally different than considered here , since gamma - ray measurements of the inner galaxy can strongly constrain annihilations in the smooth halo for the density profiles considered and a velocity dependence in the enhancement was not taken into account in those studies .",
    "if one takes the position that astrophysical resolutions of the positron excess are untenable , then to have a viable dark matter scenario requires invoking a relatively - large annihilation cross section .",
    "one possibility for achieving this goal is a velocity - dependent cross section due to the presence of a new medium - range force resulting in a sommerfeld enhancement . in this study , we have examined the observational consequences of annihilation to charged particles in the context of a halo populated with dark matter substructure .    in determining the dark matter annihilation signatures of galactic substructure",
    ", it must be kept in mind that the microphysics ( annihilation ) occurs within kinematically distinct subhalos so that their macroscopic distribution sets many aspects of the problem .",
    "we have demonstrated that for a range of models , sommerfeld - based or otherwise , annihilations in substructure , rather than in the smooth halo , are the dominant source of the locally - measured lepton flux .",
    "these substructure - dominated models imply associated ib and ic gamma - ray emission at high latitudes at a level accessible to ( and possibly already in tension with ) current observations .",
    "we have also argued that hess tev electron measurements can be regarded as limits on the isotropic tev gamma rays arising from ib .",

    "<S> due to their higher concentrations and small internal velocities , milky way subhalos can be at least as important as the smooth halo in accounting for the gev positron excess via dark matter annihilation . after showing how this can be achieved in various scenarios , including in sommerfeld models , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , in this case , the diffuse inverse - compton emission resulting from electrons and positrons produced in substructure leads to a nearly - isotropic signal close to the level of the isotropic gev gamma - ray background seen by fermi . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that hess cosmic - ray electron measurements can be used to constrain multi - tev internal bremsstrahlung gamma rays arising from annihilation to charged leptons . </S>"
