    "the scissors mode excitation in an even - even nucleus with a @xmath14 ground state is a state with quantum numbers @xmath15 arising from the operator @xmath16 acting on the ground state . here",
    "@xmath17 is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath16 is the isovector orbital angular momentum operator .",
    "of course one can also get excitations from the isovector spin - operator @xmath18 as well , but in this work we focus mainly on orbital excitations .",
    "the collective aspect of this excitation mode was emphasized as early as 1978 by n. lo iudice and f. palumbo @xcite , who pictured the scissors mode as a vibration of the deformed symmetry axis of all the protons against that of all the neutrons .",
    "experimental evidence for the existence of a scissors mode in @xmath19 was obtained by d. bohle @xmath20 @xcite of the darmstadt group in 1984 .",
    "it was soon realized , however , that the initial picture was too extreme and that mainly only the valence nucleons contributed to the scissors mode excitation , because one can not have @xmath21 excitations of any kind in a closed major shell .",
    "the @xmath22 treatment of iachello @xcite does involve only valence bosons and gives more reasonable results .",
    "shell model approaches also involve valence nucleons , see for instance the early work of zamick @xcite and that of chaves and poves @xcite .",
    "it was realized that one could connect the isovector orbital strength @xmath23 to the nuclear deformation parameter @xmath24 or , alternatively , to the electric quadrupole strength @xmath25 in a given nucleus .",
    "for example , rohoziwski and greiner @xcite have obtained an expression in which the @xmath23 scissors - mode strength is proportional to @xmath26 . in another approach known as the `` generalized coherent state model ''",
    ", raduta @xmath20 have also obtained the same @xmath26 dependence of the @xmath21 strength @xcite , see also the works of hamamoto and magnusson @xcite and enders @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the connection with deformation has led to the suggestion of using a quadrupole - quadrupole interaction in shell model calculations which aim to study the scissors mode . in a previous work by one of the present authors",
    "@xcite , it was shown that with a simple @xmath27 interaction the summed energy - weighted isovector orbital @xmath21 strength was proportional not simply to the @xmath25 but rather to @xmath28 where the first term was calculated with the effective nuclear charges @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the second term with @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "this expression has the correct behaviour when one of the major shells of neutrons or protons is closed . in that case",
    ", one can have finite @xmath25 s but vanishing @xmath32 s ) .",
    "indeed , for such a case , the isoscalar and isovector @xmath25 sums are the same and their difference vanishes .",
    "there have also been related calculations which included excitations to higher shells @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that in the simple nilsson model the amount of energy - weighted strength at @xmath33 is the same as at @xmath7 .",
    "more detailed calculations with an isovector @xmath0 interaction have also been performed @xcite .    in this work",
    "we shall consider a combination of a @xmath34 interaction and an isospin - conserving pairing interaction .",
    "we shall examine light nuclei with a focus on the difference in behaviour of the transitions in which the final isospin is different from the initial isospin versus transitions in which the isospin is unchanged . in heavy nuclei with large neutron excess ,",
    "such an analysis is not possible at present .",
    "we would argue that if indeed the @xmath23 is simply connected to deformation ( as is the case for the scissors states ) , then the stronger we make the @xmath0 strength relative to the pairing strength the stronger should be the summed isovector orbital @xmath23 .",
    "we will see in the next sections whether this is what happens in various cases .",
    "one word about the isospin - conserving pairing interaction ( icp ) .",
    "if one limits oneself to a pairing interaction involving particles of one kind , then the double commutator of the isovector orbital angular momentum operator with such a ( non - isospin conserving ) pairing interaction will vanish .",
    "so if this were the only interaction present , the @xmath23 would vanish .",
    "but when we include in the pairing interaction also the @xmath35 pairing between a neutron and a proton , the situation becomes more complicated as will be seen in the following sections .",
    "the two - body interaction that we use in our calculations can be written as the sum of the @xmath27 term and the isospin - conserving pairing interaction ( @xmath36 ) term .",
    "the ( @xmath36 ) term is defined by :    @xmath37    whereas the @xmath0 interaction is @xmath38 .    here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are the respective strengths of these two interactions .",
    "we carry out calculations with a hamiltonian that involves a kinetic energy and harmonic oscillator single - particle terms plus the @xmath0 and @xmath36 two - body interaction terms .",
    "these calculations are carried out in the @xmath41 space using the computer code @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we consider the four nuclei @xmath3 , @xmath9 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 .",
    "for each nucleus we calculate the summed isovector orbital transition strength @xmath23 from the ground state to all the @xmath15 states with a given @xmath43 in our @xmath41space . for the @xmath1 nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we sum the @xmath44 isovector orbital @xmath21 excitations from the @xmath14 , @xmath45 ground state to all the @xmath15 , @xmath46 states in the @xmath7 space . for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we can have both @xmath47 and @xmath48 transitions from the @xmath8 ground state to @xmath49 states , and we sum their strengths separately .    in table",
    "i we give the values of the summed isovector orbital @xmath21 strengths in the extreme limits of a pure @xmath0 ( @xmath50 ) and a pure icp ( @xmath51 ) interaction separately .",
    "note that , in figs . 1 - 4 , the @xmath50 results are those at the extreme left of each figure while the @xmath51 values are the asymptotic values of the curves at the extreme right of each figure and beyond .",
    "for all combinations of the different strenghts of the @xmath0 and icp interactions , the summed isoscalar orbital transitions vanish in all nuclei .",
    "this is true for @xmath52 and @xmath5 transitions in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and it is also true for @xmath11 and @xmath13 transitions in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath1 nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 have @xmath45 ground - state isospins , and isovector transitions from such a state will therefore lead only to @xmath46 excited states . in figs . 1 and 2",
    ", we show the results of calculations of the isovector orbital summed @xmath21 strengths as a function of the parameter @xmath53 where @xmath54 . in the @xmath55 model ,",
    "the excitation energy of the @xmath56 state is @xmath57 .",
    "hence the ratio @xmath58 is a dimensionless parameter which tells us how the strength of the icp interaction relates to an @xmath55-model estimate of @xmath59 .",
    "the limiting case where the @xmath0 interaction is turned off corresponds to @xmath53 going to infinity , while for the pure @xmath0 case @xmath53 is zero .",
    "essentially , our parameter @xmath53 is proportional to the ratio of the relative strengths of the @xmath36 and @xmath0 interactions .    examining figs . 1 and 2 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively",
    ", we see that as we move rightwards from @xmath60 the summed isovector orbital magnetic dipole strength starts to go down approximately linearly from an initially large value ( for @xmath60 ) .",
    "but then this summed @xmath23 levels off and reaches a @xmath61 asymptotic value .",
    "this tells us that as we add an icp interaction to what was originally a pure @xmath0 interaction the summed isovector orbital magnetic dipole strength decreases . at the other extreme , for large @xmath62",
    "we get a non - zero value of this @xmath21 strength . in other words , if we just have an icp interaction we get a finite summed isovector orbital strength from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "this is a non - scissors - mode contribution and as such is a new mode of excitation .",
    "however , the addition of a @xmath0 interaction to an @xmath36 interaction does lead to an enhancement of the isovector orbital strength , and a scissors - mode contribution is present in that case as well .      for nuclei with @xmath46 ground states , such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "we consider separately the summed isovector orbital @xmath11 transitions and @xmath13 transitions , see figs . 3 and 4 .    for the @xmath46 to @xmath46 transitions",
    ", the summed isovector orbital magnetic dipole strength vanishes in the limiting case of a vanishing @xmath0 interaction ( corresponding to @xmath62 going to infinity ) .",
    "this vanishing for a pure icp interaction is shown analytically in appendix a. this @xmath11",
    "mode displays the simple scissors - mode behaviour ; for a fixed strength @xmath40 of the @xmath0 interaction , the summed isovector orbital magnetic dipole strength decreases as we increase the icp strength @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the pairing interaction serves to decrease the summed isovector orbital strength .    for @xmath13 transitions",
    "the behaviour is quite different . in @xmath9 , as we increase the parameter @xmath62 , the summed isovector orbital magnetic dipole strength decreases rapidly from a large value , but reaches an asymptotic value for large @xmath62 that is non - zero ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    for @xmath10 , we find that the summed isovector orbital magnetic dipole strength hardly changes at all as we increase the value of the parameter @xmath62 , and the value of the summed strength always remains very close to unity ( see fig .",
    "more specifically the strength is 1.098 for @xmath63 , decreases to 0.985 for @xmath64 and then increases to 1.174 for @xmath65 .",
    "thus the summed transition strength is rather insensitive to what we choose as the strength parameters of the @xmath0 and icp interactions , provided of course that we do not change their overall signs .",
    "we can call these newly studied isovector orbital @xmath21 excitations of the @xmath66 states in @xmath10 the @xmath67 modes .      in @xmath10",
    ", it is interesting to study also two energy - weighted isovector orbital @xmath23 sums .",
    "if we consider an initial state @xmath68 and many final states @xmath69 , the energy - weighted @xmath23 sum ( @xmath70 ) is then defined as @xmath71 .",
    "one energy - weighted isovector orbital @xmath23 sum is @xmath72 , which considers all the isovector orbital @xmath21 transitions from the @xmath73 , @xmath46 ground state to all the @xmath49 , @xmath46 states in our @xmath7 model space .",
    "the other energy - weighted sum is @xmath74 which considers all the isovector orbital @xmath21 transitions from the @xmath75 ground state to all the @xmath49 , @xmath76 states in our model space .",
    "for a given value of @xmath77 , we studied the behaviour of the quantities @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 as a function of our usual parameter @xmath81 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "5 for @xmath62 ranging from 0 to 1 .",
    "three curves are drawn there corresponding respectively to @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    from fig .",
    "5 , it is clear that for @xmath82 the sum @xmath80 is insensitive to @xmath62 .",
    "this sum varies in this region only by @xmath83 although a and b individually decrease respectively , by close to a factor of three in each case .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "5 we used a single value of @xmath77 ( with @xmath84 ) , and we varied @xmath62 by simply varying @xmath39 .",
    "however , we have found that the quantity @xmath85 still remains insensitive to @xmath62 as we vary both @xmath39 and @xmath77 independently .",
    "in this paper we have reported on the results of a comparative shell - model study of isovector orbital magnetic dipole transitions ( iomd ) in light even - even nuclei using a combination of a quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath27 ) interaction and an isospin - conserving pairing ( icp ) interaction .",
    "we have found that the iomd transitions involving @xmath86 states have a non - scissors mode behaviour in the sense that the iomd strength remains finite even for a vanishing deformation - inducing interaction such as @xmath27 . comparing the results for the extreme situations of @xmath87 and @xmath50 ( absence of the @xmath27 interaction , and absence of the icp interaction , respectively ) , one notices that the contribution of the @xmath27 interaction prevails over that of the icp one .",
    "an exception is the case of @xmath10 where the contribution of icp is slightly larger than that of @xmath27 .",
    "since this case reveals quite unexpected properties , we refer to the corresponding mode as a _",
    "new mode_. in this mode , the isovector orbital @xmath21 excitation from @xmath46 to @xmath76 is relatively insensitive to the strength of the @xmath0 and/or that of the pairing interaction .",
    "furthermore , the summed energy - weighted isovector orbital @xmath23 , when added for both @xmath88 and @xmath89 is again quite insensitive to the ratio of the isospin - conserving pairing interaction strength to the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction strength .",
