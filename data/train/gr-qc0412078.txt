    "the description of the different phases of the universe concerning the time evolution of its acceleration field is among the main objectives of the cosmological models .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the universe at present is dominated by the so - called dark energy .",
    "although the nature of the dark energy ( de ) is currently unknown , it is felt that de is non - baryonic in origin @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that the dark energy has large negative pressure that leads to accelerated expansion of the universe .    in view of its importance in explaining the observational cosmology many authors have considered cosmological models with dark energy .",
    "the simplest example of dark energy is a cosmological constant , introduced by einstein in 1917 @xcite .",
    "the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite has promoted the search for new types of matter that can behave like a cosmological constant @xcite by combining positive energy density and negative pressure .",
    "this type of matter is often called _",
    "quintessence_. zlatev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that `` tracker field '' , a form of qiuntessence , may explain the coincidence , adding new motivation for the quintessence scenario .",
    "an alternative model for the dark energy density was used by kamenshchik _",
    "@xcite , where the authors suggested the use of some perfect fluid but obeying `` exotic '' equation of state .",
    "this type of matter is known as _ chaplygin gas_. the fate of density perturbations in a universe dominated by the chaplygin gas , which exhibit negative pressure was studied by fabris _",

    "@xcite . in a recent paper kremer @xcite",
    "has modelled the universe as a binary mixture whose constitutes are described by a van der waals fluid and by a dark energy density . in doing",
    "so the authors considered mainly a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe described by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "the theoretical arguments and recent experimental data , which support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one , lead to consider the models of universe with anisotropic back - ground .",
    "the simplest of anisotropic models , which nevertheless rather completely describe the anisotropic effects , are bianchi type - i ( bi ) homogeneous models whose spatial sections are flat but the expansion or contraction rate is direction - dependent .",
    "moreover , a bi universe falls within the general analysis of the singularity given by belinskii et al  @xcite and evolves into a frw universe  @xcite in presence of a matter obeying the equation of state @xmath2 .",
    "since the modern - day universe is almost isotropic at large , this feature of the bi universe makes it a prime candidate for studying the possible effects of an anisotropy in the early universe on present - day observations . in a number of papers ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite , we have studied the role of a nonlinear spinor and/or a scalar fields in the formation of an anisotropic universe free from initial singularity .",
    "it was shown that for a suitable choice of nonlinearity and the sign of @xmath3 term the model in question allows regular solutions and the universe becomes isotropic in the process of evolution .",
