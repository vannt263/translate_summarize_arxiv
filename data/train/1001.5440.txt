    "the magnetic fields are set to zero everywhere but on the chain @xmath1 , where the field is let to change within the saturation region , @xmath230 ( bottom to top ) .",
    "solid ( dashed ) lines are for for @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "all quantities are dimensionless . ]    for the sake of clarity , we consider extremely anisotropic conditions , setting @xmath233 . in the case of no magnetic field on both qubits , @xmath234 , a very simple expression for the concurrence is found , due to the fact that @xmath235 is a constant of motion .",
    "in particular , if the two qubits are initially prepared in a combination of the two antiparallel bell state , their concurrence will evolve as @xmath236 . on the other hand ,",
    "if parallel bell states are used to build up the initial entangled state , it is @xmath237 . as a consequence , if @xmath238 ( holding when @xmath239 ) , the two - qubit concurrence can not switch between @xmath231 and @xmath232 . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath240 , one can drive the two - qubit system from parallel - type to antiparallel and viceversa .",
    "in fact , the switching between parallel and antiparallel entanglement is observed when @xmath241 and @xmath242 are flipped , under the effect of the coupling with the first spin of their respective chain , at different frequencies ( for instance when @xmath243 ) , or when the dynamics of one subsystem is slowed down with respect to the other ( for instance due to the fact that the field on one of the two chains is larger than the saturation value , as seen in sec .  [ ss.isocoupling ] ) .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a two - channel entanglement evolution has an upper bound given by the product of the one - channel dynamics .",
    "therefore , for such an `` entanglement switching '' to occur , the hamiltonian parameters of subsystems @xmath7 and @xmath8 should be set so as to retain high entanglement values . by fixing @xmath244 , while setting @xmath245 in order to slow down the entanglement relaxation in the corresponding channel , the efficiency of the switching increases .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ f.aniso ] . on the other hand",
    ", we can decrease @xmath246 so that channel @xmath8 is far more responsible for the entanglement evolution . in this case too a very efficient switching mechanism is achieved , suggesting that the saturation region of the chain is associated to an effective decoupling of the qubit from its corresponding environment .",
    "finally , we notice that , being the coefficients defined by eqs .",
    "( [ e.pideltaxyresum ] ) regular oscillating functions of time , the concurrence can only vanish on a countable number of points on the temporal axis and can not remain null for finite intervals of time . therefore , entanglement sudden death is not observed .",
    "we have analyzed the dynamics of an entangled qubit - pair connected to two structured environments composed of open - ended and finite interacting spin chains .",
    "the intra - chain interaction has been modeled by an xx heisenberg - like hamiltonian , while the coupling between each qubit and its respective environment has been realized via an xy exchange term with the first spin of the chain .",
    "application of uniform magnetic fields has been also considered .",
    "we have exactly determined the time - dependent two - qubit density matrix , starting from information gathered on the single - qubit dynamics .",
    "we have then provided analytical solutions both for the case of finite even @xmath136 and in the thermodynamic limit , thus getting access to a full - comprehensive and general analysis of entanglement evolution .",
    "particular emphasis has been given to the relaxation - like dynamics implied by the specific type of coupling considered , which gives rise , under suitable conditions , to a sudden death of the entanglement that we have analyzed .",
    "interestingly , we have unveiled the occurrence of esd also when starting from initially pure two - qubit states , a peculiarity of our model that does not emerge under  longitudinal \" qubit - environment couplings .    by manipulating the transverse magnetic field on the initially entangled qubits ,",
    "we have shown the possibility of decoupling their dynamics from that of their respective environments , thereby allowing for a dynamical entanglement protection .",
    "on the other hand , when the magnetic fields applied to both chains are larger than the saturation value , the dynamics of the environments slows down and entanglement sudden death is not observed .",
    "interesting features are observed when the environments undergo a quantum phase transition , which in this case happens when the field applied to the chain gets the saturation value , in particular as far as the the behaviour of parallel and antiparallel concurrence is concerned .",
    "our work provides the analytical characterization of the transverse ( _ i.e. _ energy exchanging ) coupling between a simple and yet interesting out - of - equilibrium system ( the two qubits ) and a non - trivial spin environments ( the two chains ) . as spin models are now understood as effective descriptions of many different physical systems , our results hold the premises to find fertile application to a variety of cases . as a particularly interesting situation",
    ", one can think about the engineering of an effective spin environment by using unidimensional arrays of small - capacitance superconducting josephson junctions  @xcite , which show a sharp phase transition from josephson - type behavior to cooper - pair tunneling coulomb blockade analogous to that of an @xmath20 model .",
    "this implementation thus constitutes a nearly ideal test for our predictions , since the effective environmental parameters can be modified through the use of gate voltages and external magnetic fluxes .",
    "it would be very interesting to study the applicability and relevance of a study such as the one performed here to the investigation of the properties of intrinsically open systems in quantum chemistry and biology exposed to finite - sized environments . in this context",
    ", it is particularly significant that the mathematical model used in order to describe the radical pair mechanism  @xcite bears some analogies with the central - qubit model .",
