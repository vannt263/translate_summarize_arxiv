    "the evolutionary prisoner s dilemma game ( pdg ) @xcite and the snowdrift game ( sg ) @xcite have become standard paradigms for studying the possible emergence of cooperative phenomena in a competitive setting .",
    "physicists find such emergent phenomena fascinating , as similar cooperative effects are also found in interacting systems in physics that can be described by some minimal models , e.g. models of interacting spin systems .",
    "these games are also essential in the understanding of coexistence of ( and competition between ) egoistic and altruistic behavior that appear in many complex systems in biology , sociology and economics",
    ". the basic pdg @xcite consists of two players deciding simultaneously whether to cooperate ( c ) or to defect ( d ) .",
    "if one plays c and the other plays d , the cooperator pays a cost of @xmath0 while the defector receives the highest payoff @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "if both play c , each player receives a payoff of @xmath3 .",
    "if both play d , the payoff is @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the pdg is characterized by the ordering of the four payoffs @xmath5 , with @xmath6 . in a single round of the game , it is obvious that defection is a better action in a fully connected ( well - fixed ) population , regardless of the opponents decisions .",
    "modifications on the basic pdg are , therefore , proposed in order to induce cooperations and to explain the wide - spread cooperative behavior observed in the real world .",
    "these modifications include , for example , the iterated pdg @xcite , spatially extended pdg @xcite and games with a third strategy @xcite .",
    "the snowdrift game ( sg ) , which is equivalent to the hawk - dove or chicken game @xcite , is a model somewhat favorable for cooperation .",
    "it is best introduced using the following scenario @xcite .",
    "consider two drivers hurrying home in opposite directions on a road blocked by a snowdrift .",
    "each driver has two possible actions  to shovel the snowdrift ( cooperate ( c ) ) or not to do anything ( not - to - cooperate or  defect \" ( d ) ) .",
    "if they cooperate , they could be back home earlier and each will get a reward of @xmath7 . shovelling is a laborious job with a total cost of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , each driver gets a net reward of @xmath9 .",
    "if both drivers take action d , they both get stuck , and each gets a reward of @xmath4 .",
    "if only one driver takes action c and shovels the snowdrift , then both drivers can also go home .",
    "the driver taking action d ( not to shovel ) gets home without doing anything and hence gets a payoff @xmath10 , while the driver taking action c gets a  sucker \" payoff of @xmath11 .",
    "the sg refers to the case when @xmath12 , leading to the ranking of the payoffs @xmath13 .",
    "this ordering of the payoffs _ defines _ the sg .",
    "therefore , both the pdg and sg are defined by a payoff matrix of the form @xmath14 and they differ only in the ordering of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is this difference that makes cooperators persist more easily in the sg than in the pdg . in a well - mixed population ,",
    "cooperators and detectors coexist . due to the difficulty in measuring payoffs and the ordering of the payoffs accurately in real world situations where game theory is applicable @xcite , the sd has been taken to be a possible alternative to the pdg in studying emerging cooperative phenomena @xcite .",
    "the present work will focus on two aspects of current interest . in many circumstances ,",
    "the connections in a competing population are better modelled by some networks providing limited interactions than a fully - connected network .",
    "previous studies showed that different spatial structures might lead to different behaviors @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been demonstrated that spatial structures would promote cooperation in the pdg @xcite , but would suppress cooperation in the sg @xcite .",
    "there are other variations on the sg that resulted in improved cooperation @xcite . here",
    ", we explore the effects of an underlying network on the evolutionary sg in a population in which there exists an additional type of players .",
    "the latter is related to the fact that real - world systems usually consist of people who would adopt a strategy other than just c and d. for example , there may be people who do not like to participate in the competition and would rather take a small but fixed payoff .",
    "_ studied the effects of the presence of such persons , called loners @xcite , in a generalization of the pdg called the public goods game(pgg ) .",
    "motivated by these works of hauert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we study the effects of risk averse loners in the evolutionary sg . in our model , evolution or adaptation is built in by allowing players to replace his character or strategy by that of a better - performing connected neighbor .",
    "we focus on both the steady state and the dynamics , and study how an underlying network structure affects the emergence of cooperation .",
    "it is found that in a fully - connected network , the c - players and d - players _ can not _ coexist with the loners . in a square lattice , however , cooperators are easier to survive . depending on the payoffs , there are situations in which c - players , d - players and loners can coexist .    in sec . [ sec : model ] , the evolutionary sg with loners in a population with connections is presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation results and discussions ] , we present detailed numerical results in fully - connected networks and in square lattices , and discuss the physics of the observed features .",
    "the effects of noise are also discussed .",
    "we summarize our results in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider an evolutionary snowdrift game in which the competitions between players are characterized by the payoff matrix @xmath17 here , each player takes on one of three possible characters or strategies : to cooperate ( c ) , to defect ( d ) , or to act as a loner ( l ) .",
    "the matrix element gives the payoff to a player using a strategy listed in the left hand column when the opponent uses a strategy in the top row . in the basic sg , it is useful to assign @xmath18 so that the payoffs can be characterized by a single parameter @xmath19 representing the cost - to - reward ratio @xcite . in terms of @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 , @xmath18 , @xmath22 , and @xmath4 . a competition involving",
    "a loner leads to a payoff @xmath23 for both players . here",
    ", we explore the range of @xmath24 .",
    "spatial networking effects and evolutions are incorporated into the sg as follows . at the beginning of the game ,",
    "the players are arranged onto the nodes of a network and the character @xmath25 of each player is assigned randomly among the choices of c , d , and l. our discussion will be mainly on fully - connected graphs and regular lattices . in a fully - connected network ,",
    "every player is connected to all other players . in a square lattice ,",
    "a player is linked only to his four nearest neighbors .",
    "numerical studies are carried out using monte carlo simulations as reported in the work of szab _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "the evolution of the character of the players is governed by the following dynamics . at any time during the game , each player competes with all the players that he is linked to and hence has a payoff . a randomly chosen player @xmath26 reassesses his own strategy by comparing his payoff @xmath27 with the payoff @xmath28 of a randomly chosen connected neighbor @xmath29 . with probability @xmath30 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left([p(i ) - p(j)]/k\\right)},\\ ] ] the player @xmath26 adopts the strategy of player @xmath29 .",
    "otherwise , the strategy of player @xmath26 remains unchanged . here",
    "@xmath31 is a noise parameter @xcite that determines the likelihood that player @xmath26 replaces his strategy when he meets someone with a higher payoff . for @xmath32 ,",
    "a player @xmath26 is almost certain to replace ( not to replace ) his strategy when he meets someone with a better ( worse ) payoff . for large @xmath31",
    ", a player has a probability of @xmath33 to replace his strategy , regardless of whether @xmath28 is better or worse than @xmath27 . in a fully connected network ,",
    "a player s character may be replaced by any player in the system . in a square lattice ,",
    "a player s character can only be replaced by one of his four connected neighbors .",
    "as the game evolves , the fractions of players with the three characters also evolve .",
    "these fractions are referred to as frequencies .",
    "depending on the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath23 , the cooperator frequency @xmath35 , defector frequency @xmath36 , and loner frequency @xmath37 take on different values in the long time limit .",
    "we performed detailed numerical studies on our model . the number of players in the system is taken to be @xmath38 . in getting the fraction of players of different characters in the long time limit",
    ", we typically average over the results of @xmath39 monte - carlo time steps per site ( mcs ) , after allowing @xmath40 mcs for the system to reach the long time limit .",
    "averages are also taken over 10 initial configurations of the same set of parameters .",
    "figure 1 shows the results for fully connected networks .",
    "a value of @xmath41 is taken .",
    "the cooperator frequency @xmath35 , defector frequency @xmath36 , and loner frequency @xmath37 are obtained as a function of the cost - to - benefit ratio @xmath34 for three different values of the loner s payoff @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . in the absence of loners @xcite , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in a fully connected network . from figure 1 , the loners extinct for a range of values of @xmath47 in which the behavior is identical to the basic sg . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the loners invade the whole population and both cooperators and defectors disappear .",
    "this is similar to the results in the pdg @xcite and in the pgg @xcite . in a fully connected network ,",
    "the three characters _ can not _ coexist .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the rock - scissors - paper game @xcite on a fully connected network in which the three strategies coexist .",
    "we obtained @xmath49 numerically .",
    "the result is shown in figure 1(d ) as a curve in the @xmath34-@xmath23 parameter space .",
    "it is found that @xmath49 follows the functional form @xmath50 , which will be explained later .",
    "the curve @xmath49 represents a phase boundary that separates the @xmath34-@xmath23 space into two regions .",
    "the region below ( above ) the curve corresponds to a phase in which cooperators and defectors ( only loners ) coexist ( exist ) .",
    "we also studied the temporal evolution in both phases , i.e. , for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "taking @xmath51 , for example , @xmath52 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the first @xmath39 mcs .",
    "the initial frequencies are @xmath56 for all three characters . for values of @xmath34 deep into either phase ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the transient behavior dies off rapidly and the extinct character typically vanishes after @xmath57 mcs . in the phase where c and d coexist ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 oscillate slightly with time in the long time limit , due to the dynamical nature of the game .",
    "it is noted that for @xmath58 , the strategies compete for a long while and the transient behavior lasts for a long time .",
    "this slowing down behavior is typical of that near a transition .",
    "the behavior of @xmath59 follows from the rule of character evolution . in a fully - connected network ,",
    "all c - players have the _ same _ payoff @xmath60 and all d - players have the _ same _ payoff @xmath61 .",
    "these payoffs depend on @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 at each time step .",
    "the payoff for a loner is @xmath62 at all time , for a system with @xmath63 . for small @xmath31",
    ", @xmath37 decays exponentially with time if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are both greater than @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , the phase with only non - vanishing @xmath35 and @xmath36 is achieved by having @xmath64 . for this phase in the long time limit , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . together with @xmath67 ( since @xmath68 in the phase under consideration ) , the condition @xmath64 implies @xmath69 and @xmath46 .",
    "these results are identical to the basic sg ( without loners ) in a fully connected network .",
    "the validity of this solution requires @xmath70 ( and hence @xmath71 ) , which is equivalent to @xmath72 .",
    "this is exactly the phase boundary shown in figure 1(d ) .",
    "the behavior of the game in a square lattice is expected to be quite different , due to the restriction that a player can only compete with his connected neighbors .",
    "we carried out simulations on @xmath73 square lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "figure 3(a)-(c ) shows @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 for three different values of the loner payoff @xmath23 .",
    "the results for the spatial sg ( without loners ) on a square lattice @xcite is also shown ( solid lines in figure 3(a ) and 3(b ) ) for comparison .",
    "a value @xmath41 is used .",
    "several features should be noted . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the loners eventually vanish with @xmath35 and @xmath36 take on the mean values in the spatial sg without loners .",
    "this behavior is similar to that in fully connected networks . for @xmath78 , however , the behavior is different from that in fully connected networks . here ,",
    "c , d , and l characters coexist . above @xmath79 , @xmath36 drops with @xmath34 to a finite value , leaving rooms for @xmath37 to increase with @xmath34 .",
    "the cooperator frequency remains finite above @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the cooperator frequency or the cooperative level in the system as a whole is significantly _ improved _ by the presence of loners . for @xmath80 , increasing the payoff @xmath23 of loners leads to a higher cooperator frequency and lower defector frequency . reading out @xmath79 for different values of @xmath23 , we get the phase boundary as shown in figure 3(d ) that separates a region characterized by the coexistence of three characters and a region in which only c and d coexist .",
    "the results indicate that , due to the restriction imposed by the spatial geometry that a player can only interact with his four nearest neighbors , it takes a certain non - vanishing value of @xmath34 for loners to survive even in the limit of @xmath81 .",
    "the behavior is therefore different from that in a fully connected network for which the boundary is given by @xmath50 .",
    "note that there exists a region of small values of @xmath34 in which the steady state consists of a uniform population of c strategy ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) and fig .",
    "3(d ) ) . for small @xmath23 ,",
    "loners are easier to survive , when compared with the fully connected case . putting these results together , the phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "3(d ) ) for a square lattice , therefore , shows three different phases .",
    "the most striking effect of the spatial structure is that cooperators now exist in every phase .",
    "interestingly , we found that the phase boundary @xmath82 in figure 3(d ) can be described quantitatively as follows .",
    "we _ assume _ that the survival of loners is related to the cooperator frequency .",
    "in particular , loner survival requires the cooperator frequency to drop below a certain level @xmath83 and that this value is the same in a square lattice as in a fully connected network .",
    "that is to say , we assume that loners could survive , for a given value of @xmath23 and @xmath31 , only when @xmath84 . numerical results also indicate that when all loners extinct , @xmath35 and @xmath36 follow the results in a spatial sg without loners .",
    "this is shown as the solid line in figure 3(a ) . therefore ,",
    "for a given value of @xmath23 , we can simply read out the value of @xmath34 such that @xmath85 from the results in spatial sg in a square lattice . for different values of @xmath23 , this procedure results in the dashed line shown in figure 3(d ) which describes the phase boundary quite well .",
    "figure 4 shows the temporal dependence of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 in a square lattice for two values of @xmath34 at @xmath51 . for @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , which corresponds to a case in which only cooperators and defectors coexist , the number of loners decay rapidly in time , typically within 100 mcs . after the transient behavior",
    ", the cooperator and defector frequencies only oscillate slightly about their mean values .",
    "this behavior is similar to that in the c and d coexistence phase in figure 1(d ) for fully - connected networks . for @xmath87 ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) , which corresponds to a case with the three characters coexist , the long time behavior of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is oscillatory .",
    "similar behavior has been found in the rock - scissors - paper game @xcite and in the voluntary pdg @xcite . due to the dynamical nature of character evolution",
    ", there are continuous replacements of one character by another and this oscillatory behavior is expected .",
    "the major difference between a square lattice and a fully - connected network is that in a fully - connected network , each player competes with all other players . as a result , there are only three payoffs in the system ",
    "one for each type of player , at each time step .",
    "the loners , for example , have a constant payoff of @xmath62 , while the cooperators and defectors have payoffs that depend on @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "once @xmath62 is higher than the payoffs of cooperators and defectors , the number of loners grows until they take over the whole population . in a square lattice",
    ", however , each player has a payoff that depends on his character _ and _ the detail of his neighborhood , i.e. , the characters of his four connected neighbors .",
    "this implies that the c - players and d - players in a square lattice may have different payoffs depending on the characters of his connected neighbors .",
    "the loners have a constant payoff of @xmath88 .",
    "the non - uniform payoffs among c - players and d - players in a lattice allow some c and d players to coexist with the loners , by evolving to spatial local configurations that favor their survivals .    since the adaptive rule is related to the payoff of each character , it will be interesting to compare the payoffs in a spatial sg without and with loners .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows the mean payoffs of cooperators and defectors as a function of @xmath34 in a spatial sg in a square lattice _ without _ loners .",
    "the averaged payoff over all players is also shown . for small @xmath34 ,",
    "there is a phase with all c players and the payoff is 4 for each of the c players . for large @xmath34",
    ", there is a phase with all d players and the payoff is zero . for intermediate @xmath34 where c and d players coexist ,",
    "the mean payoff drops gradually with @xmath34 . in a spatial sg _ with _",
    "loners ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) , it is observed that the mean payoffs basically follow that in figure 5(a ) in the phase where loners are completely replaced .",
    "when loners can survive , the presence of these loners increases the payoffs of both the remaining cooperators and defectors .",
    "the loners themselves have a payoff of @xmath89 in a 2d square lattice .",
    "the cooperators payoff is enhanced once loners survive and the increase follows the same form as the increase in the loner frequency with @xmath34 ( compare the circles in fig .",
    "5(b ) with the squares in fig .",
    "3(c ) in the range of @xmath34 when loners survive ) .",
    "when loners survive , the payoff averaged over all players is significantly _ enhanced _ due to their presence .",
    "this is similar to what was found in the voluntary pdg @xcite .",
    "all the results reported so far are for the case of @xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to a case where the player is highly likely to replace his character when he meets a better - performing player . in figure 6",
    ", we show the effects of the noise parameter for a fixed @xmath42 . as @xmath31 increases",
    ", the step - like structure in @xmath35 as a function of @xmath34 becomes less obvious and @xmath35 is gradually suppressed in the @xmath90 limit .",
    "the most important effect of a 2d square lattice is that each player is restricted to interact with his four neighbors .",
    "take a player of character @xmath25 , he will only encounter a finite number of configurations for which he is competing in .",
    "for example , his four neighbors may consist of 4 c - players ; 3 c - players and 1 d - player or 1-loner , etc .",
    "each of these configurations corresponds to a @xmath27 . in a square lattice , therefore , there will be a finite number of payoffs for a c - player , depending on the characters of the neighbors .",
    "similarly , there are finite number of payoffs for a d - player .",
    "the loners always get a payoff of @xmath88 .",
    "for @xmath91 , the adaptive mechanism is strictly governed by the ordering of these payoffs .",
    "the distribution of players in a square lattice will then evolve in time according to how the payoffs are ordered . in the long time",
    "limit , only a few favorable local configurations will survive and the number of players in each of these favorable configurations is high . as one increases @xmath34 slightly , the ordering of the finite number of payoffs may not change .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 will not change with @xmath34 until we reach certain values of @xmath34 that the ordering of the payoffs is changed .",
    "this gives rise to the more sudden changes in @xmath35 as observed at some values of @xmath34 and it is the reason for having step - like features in @xmath35 and @xmath36 for small values of @xmath31 .",
    "as the noise parameter @xmath31 increases , the adaptive mechanism is less dependent on the exact ordering of the payoffs .",
    "therefore , the changes in @xmath35 with @xmath34 becomes more gradual as @xmath31 increases .",
    "interestingly , less obvious step - like structures in @xmath35 are also observed in the spatial sg without loners in 2d lattices with a larger coordination number @xcite .",
    "this is also related to the picture we just described .",
    "a lattice with more neighbors will give a higher number of neighborhood configurations and hence more values of the payoffs .",
    "more configurations also imply the number of players encountering a certain configuration is smaller .",
    "thus , the number of players involved in a change in the ordering of the payoffs as @xmath34 changes is smaller .",
    "this has the effect of making the drop in @xmath35 gradual .",
    "therefore , increasing @xmath31 for a given fixed coordination number is similar in effect as increasing the coordination number for fixed @xmath31 .",
    "we studied the effects of the presence of loners in a snowdrift game with loners in fully - connected networks and in square lattices . in a fully - connected network , either cooperators live with defectors or loners take over the whole population .",
    "the condition for loners to take over is found to be @xmath92 .",
    "this result can be understood by following the payoffs of each strategy . in a fully - connected network ,",
    "the strategies payoffs are particularly simple in that they depend only on the strategy frequencies at the time under consideration , with each type of player having the same payoff .",
    "in a square lattice , the spatial sg with loners behave quite differently .",
    "it is found that the cooperators can survive in the fully parameter space covering @xmath93 and @xmath24 .",
    "depending on the values of these parameters , there are three possible phases : a uniform c - player population , c - players and d - players coexist , and coexistence of the three characters .",
    "the underlying lattice thus makes the survival of cooperators easier .",
    "the presence of loners is also found to promote the presence of cooperators .",
    "there average payoff among all players is also found to be enhanced in the presence of loners .",
    "we discussed the influence of a square lattice in terms of the payoffs of the players . in a square lattice ,",
    "spatial restriction is imposed on the players in that a player can only interact with the four nearest neighbors .",
    "this leads to a payoff that does not only depend on the character but also depend on the local environment in which the player is competing in .",
    "the players in the local environment , in turns , are also competing in their own local environment .",
    "this will lead to clustering or aggregation of players in the square lattice into configurations that the payoffs favored .",
    "the dependence of the frequencies on @xmath34 in a square lattice then reflects the change in preferred configurations as @xmath34 is changed .",
    "we also studied the effects of the noise parameter in the adaptive mechanism .",
    "it is found that as the noise parameter increases , the change of the frequencies with @xmath34 becomes more gradual .",
    "this is related to the importance of the ordering of the many payoffs in the adaptive mechanism .",
    "as the noise parameter increases , the exact ordering of the payoffs becomes less important and the change in frequencies becomes more gradual .    in closing , we note that it will be interesting to further investigate the effects of loners in the snowdrift game in networks of other structures . among them",
