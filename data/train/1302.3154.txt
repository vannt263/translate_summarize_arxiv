    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are tracers of early events in the star forming history in galaxies . however , a unique integrating picture of that history , beyond some tentative approaches , is still missing .",
    "a thorough review of several issues in this context is presented , for example , in @xcite .",
    "important aspects , that eventually deal with large scale properties of galaxies ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) are both the age and chemical abundance distribution of these clusters .",
    "even though the quality and volume of chemical abundance ( [ z / h ] ) data for gcs is steadily growing ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a key issue remains as an open subject : the connection between the gc abundances and their integrated colours .    under the common assumption of old ages , gc integrated colours should be dominated by chemical abundance ( and in a secondary way by age ) .",
    "evidence in this sense can be found , for example , in @xcite and , in the particular case of elliptical galaxies , in @xcite .    a survey of the literature reveals numerous attempts to link colours and chemical abundance , ranging from linear @xcite , quadratic ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or quartic dependences @xcite .",
    "a recent contribution on this subject has been presented by @xcite who adopt broken line fits .",
    "a clarification of the colour - abundance connection is required , since some non linear relations ( e.g.  inflected \" ) can eventually lead to gc bimodal colour distributions , even when a unimodal chemical abundance distribution is assumed ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "since bimodal colour distributions have * often * been identified as the result of genuine bimodal chemical abundance distributions , the presence of non linearities would have important consequences on the interpretation of the gc chemical abundance distributions and also on their possible quantitative connections with the diffuse stellar population in a given galaxy .",
    "ngc4486 is a particularly useful galaxy in order to revise the chemical abundance - integrated colour issue due to its large gc population and relative proximity to the sun , @xmath6 mpc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this paper presents gemini @xmath0 high quality photometry for a selected field centred 3.9 arcmin from the centre of the galaxy , including 521 gc candidates , and new @xmath2 photometry for 338 clusters within a galactocentric radius of 1.7 arcmin , which also have @xmath3 colours obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite .",
    "in addition ,",
    "aiming at extending the wavelength coverage towards the ultraviolet , we combine our gemini photometry with the @xmath7 magnitudes ( washington system ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ffg07 ) .",
    "all these data sets can be , firstly , mutually connected to define a self consistent multicolour grid , and then calibrated in terms of different chemical abundance scales , with a final goal of obtaining a simultaneous connection between metallicity and the colour indices grid .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "observations and data handling are presented in section[obs ] .",
    "the relation between the ten colour indices defined by the @xmath4 photometry is given in section[multicolour ] .",
    "this last section also explains the connection between those colour indices and others , like @xmath2 , @xmath8 , commonly used in extragalactic gcs research .",
    "section[colchem ] presents a preliminary calibration in terms of chemical abundance using two different empirical colour - metallicity scales : @xcite , and alternatively , the scale presented by @xcite , that are refreered to as b10 and u12 , respectively , in what follows . as explained in section[gcs ] , the multicolour grid can be used to define different magnitude curves ( or pseudo - spectral distributions ) as a function of @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "these _ template _ curves are used to clean the gc candidates photometric sample from field interlopers .",
    "the analysis of the residuals , in turn , would allow the detection of eventual age effects .",
    "the determination of gcs @xmath9 $ ] , via multicolor fits , is presented in section [ inverse ] .",
    "the results of confronting the ten observed gc colour histograms with models that adopt each chemical abundance calibration are described in section[modell ] .",
    "the final conclusions are given in section[conclu ] .",
    "the photometric observations presented in this paper were carried out with the fred gillette 8-m telescope ( gemini north ) and are part of a program that also includes gmos spectroscopy of a sample of selected objects that are considered as good gcs candidates ( gn-2010a - q-21 ; pi : j.c . forte ) .",
    "the field ( 5.5 arcmin on a side ) , centred 3.8 arcmin to the south and 0.9 arcmin to the west of ngc4486 , is shown in figure[gmos ] .",
    "the observing log , including dates , filters , exposures , mean air mass and composite seeing ( fwhm ) is given in table[table_1 ] .",
    ".observing log of gemini - gmos observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the gcs @xmath9 $ ] distributions inferred from the photometric observations can be compared with those arising in the models that deliver the best fits to the ten observed colour histograms and whose parameters are listed in table  [ table_6 ] .",
    "figures[histozhmodb ] and  [ histozhmodu ] display such a comparison . for clusters fainter than @xmath10 mag the models based on the b10 calibration yield mean @xmath9 $ ] of @xmath11 and @xmath12 while the adoption of the u12 calibration gives somewhat larger values , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "this paper presents a self consistent multicolour @xmath4 grid including 100 points , each with a typical uncertainty of @xmath17 mag , and based on gc candidates in ngc4486 .",
    "this grid , once calibrated in terms of two different colour - metallicity relations , has been used to infer the gcs chemical abundances from @xmath4 photometric data and to perform a comparison with simple models .",
    "the main results are :    1 .",
    "the multicolour @xmath4 relations show different degrees of non linearities .",
    "this is more evident in those colours involving the @xmath7 filter .",
    "non linearities of this kind had been previously reported by @xcite in their study of the central regions of ngc1399 .",
    "the inferred @xmath9 $ ] distributions for gcs fainter than @xmath10 mag are bimodal either adopting the  inflected \" b10 or the  broken line \" u12 colour - abundance calibrations .",
    "3 .   the model fits based on a double exponential dependence of the number of clusters with chemical abundance @xmath18 both for the blue and red gcs provide a good representation of the gc integrated colour histograms and of their inferred chemical abundance distributions .",
    "4 .   for the brightest clusters the abundance distributions appear broad and skewed and we do not reach a definite conclusion regarding the presence of bi - modality .",
    "these objects leave systematic colour residuals from the template magnitude curves that can not be easily accounted for . in a speculative way",
    ", these residuals might indicate the presence of multi - stellar populations similar to those found in systems with comparable absolute magnitudes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "adequate two - colour diagrams , such as @xmath19 vs. @xmath20 or @xmath21 vs. @xmath22 , show changes in the colour - colour slopes .",
    "these changes are detectable , for example , at @xmath23 . on the other hand , the bi - exponential modelling , adopting the b10 or u12 colour - chemical abundance relations , show that 88 and 82 percent , respectively , of the  blue \" gcs are bluer than that colour .",
    "this indicates that the  blue \" and  red \" gc sub - populations exhibit distinct colour - colour relations with a transition zone possibly between @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( where both sub - populations overlap to some degree ) .",
    "+ the results presented in this paper suggest that the origin of the gc colour bimodality has its roots in a real bimodality of their chemical abundance distributions , and are consistent with the spectroscopic analysis of gcs in roughly half of the sample of eight galaxies studied by u12 and also by @xcite in ngc3115 .",
