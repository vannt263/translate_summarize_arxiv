    ", width=288 ]    in recent years , there are theoretical efforts to understand the response of periodic force on the bio - molecules @xcite .",
    "most of these studies were confined to understand the kinetics under the equilibrium conditions @xcite . however , living systems are the open systems and never at equilibrium . in the equilibrium ,",
    "bio - molecule follows the force in phase .",
    "the force - extension curve for a periodic force , keeping other intensive quantities fixed , would result in retracing thermodynamic path , ending at the initial state .",
    "in contrast , in the non - equilibrium situation , the difference between the relaxation time and the external time scale for change of force would restrict the bio - molecule to explore a smaller region of the phase space , thereby creates hysteresis i.e. a difference in the response to an increasing and decreasing force .",
    "hysteresis is well studied in the context of the spin systems @xcite .",
    "it was found that the area of the hysteresis loop scales as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath1 are the amplitude and the frequency of the applied magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 differ from system to system @xcite and the reason for it has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "though , hysteresis has been observed in single molecule experiments @xcite , however , many aspects of these phenomena are yet to be explored . in a recent work @xcite , kapri showed that using the work theorem @xcite , it is possible to extract the equilibrium force - extension curve from the hysteresis loops . in another work , a dynamical transition has been proposed , where the area of loop changes with the frequency of the applied force from nearly zero to a finite value , similar to the one seen in case of spin systems @xcite . in low frequency limit , for a short dna ( 16 base pairs ) , the scaling exponents ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) are found to be the same as of the isotropic spin system .",
    "this raises many questions such as does the dynamical transition exist in the thermodynamic limit ? do these exponents depend on the length of the dna ? what is the role of molecular interaction ( involved in the stability of bio - molecules ) on the dynamical transition . in this context , it is pertinent to mention here that in ref .",

    "vii , we summarize our results and discuss the future perspectives .",
    "bio - molecules exhibit a wide range of time scales over which specific processes take place @xcite .",
    "for example , local motion , which involves atomic fluctuation , side chain motion and loop motion , occurs in the length scale of 0.01 to 5  and the time involved in such a process is of the order of @xmath14 to @xmath15s .",
    "the motion of helix and protein domain belong to the rigid body motion , whose typical length scales are in between 1 to 100  and time involved in such motion is in between @xmath16 to @xmath17s . here , our interest is in the large - scale motion _",
    "e.g. _ helix - coil transition , folding - unfolding transition of proteins and coil - globule transition in polymer , which occurs in the length scale more than 5  and time involved is about @xmath18 to @xmath19 s. since , such a time scale is not amenable computationally , therefore , we consider a coarse - grained model of a linear polymer chain and impose restrictive interaction among monomers in such a way that it captures some essential properties of different bio - polymers @xcite .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , where the energy of the model system is defined by the following expression : @xmath20 where , @xmath5 is the total number of beads / monomers present in the polymer chain .",
    "the distance between @xmath21 and @xmath22 bead is denoted by @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the position of bead @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "first term of eq .",
    "1 is the potential function for covalent bonds between two consecutive monomers and is represented by the harmonic potential with spring constant @xmath30 @xcite .",

    "second term of the l - j potential gives the attractive interaction between all monomers except the adjacent one .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 corresponds to the equilibrium distance in the harmonic potential , which is close to the equilibrium position of the average l - j potential .",
    "the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are set to be equal to 1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is chosen here for the dna .",
    "for the sip , we choose @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively as adopted in the model discussed in the ref .",
    ".    in force induced transitions , one stretches a bio - polymer from its ground state ( native conformation ) , therefore , properties associated with this transition are mainly governed by its native topology .",
    "the go model , which is based on the native - topology is found to be quite useful in studying the influence of mechanical forces on the bio - polymers @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that by restricting @xmath32 ( second term of l - j potential ) , it is possible to model native topology of different bio - polymers .",
    "for example , if half of a polymer chain is allowed to interact with the other half of a chain , in such a way that the first monomer interacts only with the @xmath6 monomer ( last one ) , and the second monomer interacts with the @xmath8 and so , the ground state conformation resembles a zipped conformation of dna of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) base pairs as shown in fig .",
    "1a @xcite .",
    "similarly , if any monomer of the chain is allowed to interact with the rest of non - bonded monomers of the polymer chain , the ground state will resemble the globule ( collapsed ) state of a self - interacting polymer @xcite .",
    "the native topology - based model , turns out to be quite helpful in predicting the mechanism involved in the dna unzipping and protein unfolding .",
    "it also allowed to decipher the free - energy landscapes of bio - polymers@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system is obtained from the langevin equation @xcite .",
    "it is a stochastic differential equation , which introduces friction and noise terms in to newton s second law to approximate the effects of temperature and environment :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) are the mass of a bead and the friction coefficient , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 and the random force @xmath45 is a white noise @xcite , and is related to the friction coefficient by fluctuation dissipation theorem i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "it may be noted that the friction term used here only influences the kinetics , not the thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "the choice of this dynamics keeps temperature ( @xmath47 ) constant throughout the simulation .",
    "the equation of motion is integrated by using the @xmath48 order predictor - corrector algorithm with time step @xmath49=0.025 @xcite for dna and @xmath49=0.005 for the sip , respectively .",
    "the results are averaged over many trajectories .",
    "the equilibrium properties of dna unzipping has been studied in the constant force ensemble ( cfe ) for the fixed length @xcite . here",
    ", we also study the equilibrium properties of self - interacting polymer in cfe and compare its result with dna . the equilibrium has been checked by calculating the auto - correlation function @xcite for the square of the end - to - end distance and the number of contacts @xcite . moreover ,",
    "these results are tested over many seeds and the stability of data against at least ten times longer run .",
    "we have used @xmath50 time steps out of which first @xmath51 steps are not taken in the averaging . in the equilibrium condition ,",
    "we add an energy @xmath52 to the total energy of the system given by eq . 1 @xcite .",
    "we calculate the average extension @xmath53 ( distance between the end monomers ) at different values of @xmath54 .",
    "the force - extension curves ( fig .",
    "2 ) for both cases show qualitatively similar behavior . below the critical force ,",
    "the systems remain in the zipped ( or globule ) state , and above it , in the unzipped ( or coil ) state .",
    "it may be noted that , if we decrease the force keeping the other intensive parameters fixed , the system nearly retraces the path showing that it is in the equilibrium .",
    "the equilibrium force - temperature ( @xmath55 ) diagram may be obtained by monitoring the energy fluctuation ( or the specific heat ) with temperature at different forces @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the peak in the specific heat curve gives the melting temperature at that @xmath54 , which is consistent with the @xmath56 curve for that temperature @xmath47 .",
    "the phase boundary in the @xmath55 diagrams ( fig .",
    "3 ) separates the region , where the dna ( or sip ) exists in a zipped ( or globule ) state from the region , where it exists in the unzipped ( or coil ) state .",
    "it is evident from these plots ( fig .",
    "3 ) that the melting temperature decreases with the applied force in accordance with the earlier studies @xcite .",
    "we find that the peak height increases with the chain length , though , the transition temperature ( melting temperature ) remains almost the same for different lengths .",
    "in order to study the dynamical stability of the bio - molecule under a periodic force @xcite , we add an energy @xmath57 to the total energy of the system given by eq .",
    "the value of @xmath54 increases to its maximum value @xmath58 in @xmath59 steps at interval @xmath60 and then decreases to @xmath61 in the same way @xcite .",
    "since , we are interested in the non - equilibrium regime , we allow only @xmath62 ld time steps ( much below the equilibrium time ) in each increment of @xmath63 . here , @xmath64 is the distance between the two ends of the chain at that instant of time .",
    "we keep sum of the time spent @xmath65 in each force cycle constant to keep @xmath66 constant .",
    "hence , for a given @xmath58 , @xmath62 controls the frequency . by varying @xmath58 ( keeping @xmath1 fixed ) or @xmath1 ( keeping @xmath58 fixed )",
    ", it is possible to induce a dynamical transition between a time averaged zipped ( globule ) state or unzipped ( coil ) state to a hysteretic state ( oscillating between the zipped and the unzipped state ) .",
    "the average extension of the dna ( fig .",
    "4 a & b ) and sip ( fig .",
    "4 c & d ) clearly exhibits hysteresis under the periodic force .",
    "we have performed average over 1000 cycles for different initial conformations . in figs,(4a - d ) we have shown the plots for 10 different initial conformations .",
    "all these curves overlap indicating that the system is in the steady state , irrespective of the starting conformation ( zipped or unzipped ) .",
    "if the time averaged @xmath67 is less than @xmath68 , we call the system is in the zipped state , where as if @xmath69 , it is in the open state or in the unzipped state @xcite . at low amplitude ,",
    "the chain remains in the zipped state ( fig .",
    "4a ) , with almost negligible loop area .",
    "as the frequency decreases , the system explores more phase space and acquires conformations belonging to the unzipped state .",
    "we calculate the dynamical order parameter @xcite i.e. the area of the hysteresis loop , which is defined as @xmath70    one may notice from fig .",
    "4 that the area of loop increases as the frequency decreases . after a certain frequency",
    ", the area of the loop starts decreasing , and the system nearly retraces the equilibrium path at low frequency .",
    "the self - interacting polymer , which shows the existence of globule state ( fig .",
    "2 ) at low @xmath47 , exhibits the similar behavior ( fig",
    ". 4 c & d ) .",
    "however , at high amplitude , where the dsdna shows the existence of the stretched state for all frequencies , sip shows the existence of two states i.e. extended and stretched .",
    "since , for the sip the ground state energy is quite large compare to dna , the unfolding force is also found to be larger than the dsdna .",
    "it is in accordance with the experiments @xcite .",
    "the other interesting observation from these plots is that though @xmath54 decreases from its maximum value f to 0 ( fig .",
    "4 a & c ) , @xmath67 increases and there is some lag , after which it decreases . one may recall that the relaxation time is much higher compare to the time spent at each interval of @xmath63 , and therefore , an increase in @xmath67 with decreasing @xmath54 , indicates that the system gets more time to relax . as a result",
    "@xmath67 approaches a path , which is close to the equilibrium .",
    "once the system gets enough time , the lag disappears .",
    "a similar lag can be seen , when the system starts from the open state at high @xmath1",
    ". however , in this case as @xmath1 decreases , @xmath67 decreases with increasing @xmath54 . in both the cases ,",
    "whether dna starts from the zipped or open state , as @xmath71 , the system approaches the equilibrium @xmath56 curve and the area of loop vanishes .        in fig .",
    "5 , we have plotted the area of hysteresis loop of dna ( fig . 5a ) and sip ( fig .",
    "5b ) with the frequency at different force amplitudes .",
    "one can see from these plots that the area of hysteresis loop increases with decrease in the frequency and starts decreasing after a certain frequency . at a very low frequency ,",
    "the system approaches its equilibrium i.e. the extension nearly retraces its path under the cyclic force .",
    "a & b shows the variation of loop area for dna and sip , respectively , with force amplitude at different frequencies . here",
    ", the area also increases with the amplitude and after certain amplitude , it starts decreasing similar to fig .",
    "5 . in this case",
    ", however , the system goes far away from the equilibrium .         for different lengths .",
    "it is evident from all these plots that in low frequency limit curves of different amplitudes collapse on a single line intricating that the dynamical transition may exist in the thermodynamic limit . , width=307 ]    for the spin systems , the area under the hysteresis loop ( @xmath72 ) is the measure of energy dissipated over a cycle . in a recent paper , kumar and",
    "mishra @xcite for a small dsdna ( @xmath73 base pairs ) found a similar scaling for dna unzipping i.e. the area of hysteresis loop scales with @xmath74 . in low frequency regime ,",
    "value of @xmath11 and @xmath75 are found to be equal to @xmath76 , which are same as one obtained in the case of isotropic spin system @xcite . at high frequency , the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are found to be @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , which are also consistent with isotropic spin system . in order to see whether these scaling holds for different lengths , we measured the area of hysteresis loop for the various chain length of dna ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) and plotted it with @xmath81 in the low frequency regime ( fig . 7 a - d ) and",
    "@xmath82 in the high frequency regime ( fig . 8 a - d ) . here , @xmath83 is the equilibrium critical force at that temperature ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for all lengths studied here ,",

    "here d(f ) @xmath84 @xmath85 .",
    "in high frequency regime also , curves of different length of dna collapse on a single line . ,",
    "width=307 ]    we now focus our study to sip under a periodic force , where a bead ( or monomer ) can interact with the rest of non - bonded monomers .",

    "we have studied the average energy dissipated per monomer i.e. @xmath86 , over a cycle . in the limit @xmath71 , we have plotted the @xmath86 with @xmath87 in fig .",
    "one can see the collapse of data for all lengths of different forces and frequencies . similarly , fig .",
    "11 shows the collapse of data of all lengths in high frequency regime .",
    "it is interesting to note that in high frequency regime the average dissipated energy ( @xmath88 ) is independent of length .",
    "this may be understood by realizing that the applied force will try to move the end terminal with a velocity @xmath89 . for a very short duration of time ( @xmath90 )",
    ", the applied force can move the end terminal to a finite distance , which is independent of length .",
    "hence , the area under a cycle of force ( 0 to @xmath58 and back to 0 ) will remain independent of length ( fig . 11 ) .",
    "however , in low frequency regime ( @xmath71 ) , the system gets enough time ( close to equilibrium ) .",
    "because of the connectivity of the beads in the chain , the applied force will be transmitted all along the chain .",
    "consequently , both strands will move under the periodic force and the resultant curve under hysteresis will depend on the length of the chain ( fig .",

    ", we investigate the dynamics of the system near @xmath94 under a linear ramp ( triangular shape ) , similar to the one taken in our simulation @xcite .",
    "we assume here that there is no acceleration and beads move with a uniform velocity ( because of environment ) under the applied force .",
    "the contribution of random noise is negligible and eq .",

    "we have studied these two models under a periodic force and showed that they show similar behavior .",

    "<S> using langevin dynamics simulations , we study a simple model of interacting - polymer under a periodic force . </S>",
    "<S> the force - extension curve strongly depends on the magnitude of the amplitude @xmath0 and the frequency ( @xmath1 ) of the applied force . in low frequency limit </S>",
    "<S> , the system retraces the thermodynamic path . at higher frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> response time is greater than the external time scale for change of force , which restrict the biomolecule to explore a smaller region of phase space that results in hysteresis of different shapes and sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we show the existence of dynamical transition , where area of hysteresis loop approaches to a large value from nearly zero area with decreasing frequency . the area of hysteresis loop is found to scale as @xmath2 for the fixed length . </S>",
    "<S> these exponents are found to be the same as of the mean field values for a time dependent hysteretic response to periodic force in case of the isotropic spin . </S>"
