    "<S> an implementation is proposed of single qubit gates , e.g. , phase , not , @xmath0 and hadamard , operating on polarized photons and based on light storage . instead of processing photons themselves , qubit transformations are performed on atomic excitations due to photon storage in a medium of atoms in the tripod configuration .    rapidly developing quantum information science </S>",

    "<S> photons are very efficient and comfortable carriers of information , robust with respect to decoherence . processing them </S>",
    "<S> requires however an atomic medium through which they could effectively interact . </S>",
    "<S> various optical implementations of logical operations on photon - carried qubits , based on different physical phenomena have been proposed @xcite , of which an important class take advantage of the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) ( @xcite , for a review see , e.g. , ref . </S>",

    "<S> the generic system to perform light storage is a three - level atomic lambda system , but to store a photon which may be in two possible basic states ( i.e. a qubit ) , and then to process the information stored , one needs richer schemes admitting more active atomic levels and laser couplings . </S>",
    "<S> such an interesting and flexible model may be the tripod system @xcite , combining two lambda systems which share a common coupling . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it allows for a controlled propagation / storage of a probe field under a control of two driving ones or a propagation of two probe fields controlled by a single driving one . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of three long - living lower states gives an opportunity to create two different atomic excitations at the storage stage and opens a way to processing the information supplied by the stopped photon . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus realize logical operations on photon states through ( i ) storing photons , ( ii ) performing the required operations on atomic states instead of photons themselves by applying pulses of additional electromagnetic fields and ( iii ) releasing photons in a transformed state . </S>",

    "<S> the influence of the latter is however negligible @xcite and it will not be taken into account in our further considerations . in the resonance conditions , without dissipation , the evolution equations of the medium read in the first - order perturbation approximation with respect to the probe fields @xmath46 with the rabi frequencies @xmath47 , @xmath48 . </S>",

    "<S> some of the flip operators have been substituted by their initial mean values which do not change in the first order perturbation approximation , i.e. @xmath53 . </S>",

    "<S> such a process has no significant impact on the population distribution ( it remains unchanged in the first order perturbation approximation with respect to the probe field ) .    as our goal is to influence the polarization of the released photon , we need to manipulate the polariton at the storage stage , i.e. the atomic flip operators , as follows from eqs . </S>",
