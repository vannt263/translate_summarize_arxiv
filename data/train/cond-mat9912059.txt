    "a great success of the theory of critical phenomena has been to develop methods allowing to predict these power laws @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful approaches used in the theory of critical phenomena is the renormalization group , which consists in trying to relate physical properties of a given system at different values of the external parameters ( like the temperature or the magnetic field ) . in the last three or four decades , other non - trivial power laws @xcite",

    "we report recent results on simple models of genealogical trees @xcite .",
    "when one looks at the distribution of repetitions in a genealogical tree ( in the framework of the simple models defined below ) , one observes non trivial power laws .",
    "the exponents of these power laws can be calculated _ exactly _ by writing a relation on the generating function of the weights of the ancestors ( a quantity proportional to the number of times they appear in a genealogical tree ) which has the form of a simple renormalization transformation . beyond the intrinsic interest of these models to describe real genealogies , they constitute simple pedagogical examples for which renormalization ideas allow the exact prediction of non trivial exponents .",

    "<S> the distribution @xmath2 of these weights reaches a stationary shape @xmath3 , for large @xmath0 , i.e. for a large number of generations back in the past . for small @xmath1 , @xmath3 is a power law ( @xmath4 ) , with a non - trivial exponent @xmath5 which can be computed exactly using a standard procedure of the renormalization group approach . </S>",
