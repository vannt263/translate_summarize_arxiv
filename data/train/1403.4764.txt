    "the group of classical @xmath0 bootis stars comprises late b to early f - type , population i stars , with moderate to extreme ( up to a factor of 100 ) surface underabundances of most fe - peak elements and solar abundances of lighter elements ( c , n , o , and s ) .",
    "they are rare , with a maximum of about 2% of all objects in the relevant spectral domain , between the zero- and terminal - age main - sequence ( zams and tams ) , are found to be such objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the peculiar chemical abundances on the stellar surfaces are due to selective accretion of circumstellar ( cs ) material .",
    "due to gravitational settling and radiative acceleration , it is then mixed in the shallow convection zone of the star .",
    "this explains why the anomalous abundance pattern is similar to that found in the gas phase of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in which refractory elements like iron and silicon have condensed into dust grains .",
    "later on , @xcite and @xcite developed a model which describes the interaction of the star with its local ism and/or cs environment .",
    "as a result , different levels of underabundance are produced by different amounts of accreted material relative to the photospheric mass .",
    "the small fraction of this star group on the main - sequence ( ms ) is explained by the low probability of a star - cloud interaction and by the effects of meridional circulation , which dissolves any accretion pattern a few million years after the accretion has stopped .",
    "the hot end of this model is due to significant stellar winds for stars with @xmath16@xmath1712000k whereas the cool end , at about 6500k , is defined by convection which prevents the accreted material manifesting at the stellar surface .",
    "strong support for the selective accretion scenario has been given by @xcite who found that half of their sample of herbig ae / be stars exhibit the characteristic @xmath0 bootis type abundance pattern .",
    "we know that the density of cs material around herbig ae / be stars is very high , perfectly suited as the source for accretion .",
    "almost all @xmath0 bootis stars are located within the classical @xmath15 scuti/@xmath1 doradus instability strip .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed analysis of their pulsational behaviour .",
    "they concluded that at least 70% of the group members inside the classical instability strip pulsate , and they do so with high overtone p - modes ( q@xmath180.020d ) .    in this paper , we present the newly detected @xmath1 doradus pulsational characteristics of the classical @xmath0 bootis star , hd 54272 .",
    "interesting enough , it was misidentified as a rr lyrae type star by @xcite .",
    "we performed a detailed time series analysis of the wide angle search for planets ( wasp ) and all sky automated survey ( asas ) photometric data .",
    "four statistically significant frequencies and their combinations were detected .",
    "our findings are discussed in comparison with the first hybrid @xmath0 bootis/@xmath1 doradus star , hr 8799 .",
    "the latter is a very interesting young object hosting at least four planets and a massive dusty debris disk @xcite .",
    "hd 54272 , on the other hand , is a fast rotating star almost at the tams with no detected ir excess . from spectroscopy",
    ", we deduce a metallicity of @xmath140.8 to @xmath141.1dex compared to the sun . this fact together with the high projected rotational velocities , make this object an interesting and important test case for models dealing not only with @xmath1 doradus pulsation , but also with selective accretion in the presence of meridional circulation .",

    "hd 54272 ( bd+19 1620 , v=8.80mag ) was first classified as a member of the @xmath0 bootis group by @xcite . for this star , neither a hipparcos parallax nor a radial velocity is available .",
    "@xcite searched for @xmath15 scuti type pulsations and found a null result with an upper limit of 1.4mmag within a time series of 2.6 hours .",
    "it has to be emphasized that long term trends , such as the here reported @xmath1 doradus pulsation , were not investigated .",
    "the only detailed follow - up analysis of the astrophysical parameters ( table [ stars_param ] ) for hd 54272 were presented by @xcite .",
    "the mass , effective temperature and surface gravity are typical for an early f - type ms star . from isochrone fitting , they deduce that it has already spent 83% of its ms life - time .    in this work",
    "we use the refined yerkes classification ( often denoted as ` mk system ' ) scheme introduced by @xcite .",
    "it uses the notation ` k ' , ` h ' , and ` m ' for the classification of the ca ii k , hydrogen , and metal lines according to standard stars .",
    "it allows for a more detailed stellar classification than the classical yerkes system .",
    "the spectrum of hd 54272 was observed at the osservatorio astronomico di padova - asiago with the 182 cm telescope using the boller & chivens spectrograph ( 600 lines mm@xmath3 grating ) which gave a nominal resolution of 2.0pixel@xmath3 ( dispersion of 85mm@xmath3 ) and a spectral coverage of about 1200 .    in fig .",

    "it is classified as ` ka5hf2ma5v @xmath0 boo ' .    in order to check the astrophysical parameters of hd 54272 and to search for an ir excess , we made use of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting tool by @xcite .",
    "as input data we used the available @xmath19 , 2mass and wise photometry .",
    "the effective temperature and surface gravity are well reproduced with the best fitting model .",
    "furthermore , no ir excess was detected up to 22.1@xmath20 m .",
    "we next investigated the metallicity of hd 54272 in more detail .",
    "for this , a synthesized spectrum was computed using the program spectrumgrayro / spectrum / spectrum.html ] @xcite and modified versions of the atlas9 code taken from the vienna new model grid of stellar atmospheres , nemo @xcite .",
    "we used a stellar atmosphere with the following parameters ( table [ stars_param ] ) : = 7000k , = 3.8 , and = 2kms@xmath3 .",
    "the synthetic spectrum was first folded with the instrumental profile and then with different rotational profiles yielding a best fit for 250kms@xmath3 with an uncertainty of about 25kms@xmath3 . to test these parameters ,",
    "a grid of atmospheres with effective temperatures and surface gravities around the input values were applied .",
    "the hydrogen lines are best fitted with the original values with the constraint that they are not sensitive to . to estimate the [ m / h ] value , we used different models from + 0 to @xmath142dex .",
    "figure [ synthetic ] shows the result for [ m / h]=@xmath140.5 and @xmath141.0dex , respectively .",
    "the median of the difference between the observed and synthetic spectrum with [ m / h]=@xmath141.0dex is only 0.2% .",
    "therefore we adopted this values for hd 54272 . for the estimation of its error",
    ", we used models with @xmath140.5 and @xmath141.5dex and calculated , again , the differences of the synthetic and observed spectra .",
    "we notice that the difference with the more abundant model is smaller than the one with the more underabundant one . from this , we conclude that the metallicity range is between @xmath140.8 and @xmath141.1dex .",
    "figure [ synthetic_two ] shows the effect of the underabundant model for a typical metallic - line region around 4600 .",
    "we checked if the high rotational velocity is affecting the derived metallicity .",
    "because no reliable stellar atmospheres taking into account the rotation , are available , coplanar ones are used .",
    "assuming that the line - of - sight is almost equator - on , the models of @xcite are used to find the  and  values at the poles . from their table 1",
    ", the model for a spectral type of a5 and a ratio of the angular velocity to the critical angular velocity of 0.9 almost perfectly fits the parameters of hd  54272 .",
    "it implies = 9130k and = 4.25 at the poles .",
    "again , we applied the above mentioned method to generate synthetic spectra using a different set of astrophysical parameters each 15@xmath21 along the disk and assuming rigid body rotation .",
    "for the final spectrum , we integrated all individual spectra over the stellar disk .",
    "figure [ synthetic_two ] shows the effect of the rotation using stellar atmospheres with [ m / h]=@xmath141.0dex . due to the high rotation velocity and the low abundance , the effect is only small and still in the range of the derived uncertainty",
    "this is line with the results of @xcite investigated the effect of stellar rotation on the elemental abundance for a - type stars .",
    "they found no trends for  values up to 250kms@xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "10 therein ) . as a conclusion ,",
    "we are confident that the derived metal - weakness is indeed intrinsic and not due to the inadequate treatment of stellar rotation .    according to the formula that the rotation becomes imperceptible when @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24=85mm@xmath3 , we deduce a lower limit of 85kms@xmath3 for our spectrum . from our spectral synthesis",
    ", we derive a @xmath22 of about 250@xmath1325kms@xmath3 . using the mass and radius as listed in table [ stars_param ]",
    ", we calculate a break - up velocity for hd  54272 of 313kms@xmath3 . adopting an equatorial line - of - sight",
    ", this implies that hd 54272 rotates at least with 80% of its break - up velocity .",
    "such a high velocity is exceptional not only for @xmath1 doradus pulsators @xcite , but also for ms stars close to the tams , in general @xcite",
    ". the astrophysical characteristics of hd  54272 fit within the @xmath0 bootis group .",
    "in addition , we investigated the @xmath22 distribution of the @xmath0 bootis stars , taken from @xcite , and apparent ` normal ' type stars .",
    "the latter are from the list of @xcite which covers the corresponding spectral range , excluding the late b - type stars and objects marked as ` cb ' ( binaries ) and ` cp ' ( peculiar stars ) .",
    "the samples consist of 42 @xmath0 bootis and 953 ` normal ' stars , respectively .",
    "figure [ vsini ] shows the distributions of both groups .",
    "we performed a pair - sample t - test @xcite which results that both distributions are on a 0.05 level , identical . therefore",
    ", @xmath22 seems not to be an intrinsically ` critical ' astrophysical parameter for the formation and stability of the @xmath0 bootis phenomenon .",
    "* however , the fast rotation of hd 54272 is not the common characteristics for @xmath0 bootis stars ( fig . [ vsini ] ) .",
    "but there is at least one similar member , hd  193256 ( hip  100286 ) , with a @xmath22 of about 250kms@xmath3 .",

    "they derived the astrophysical parameters as listed in table [ stars_param ] .",
    "the typical @xmath0 bootis type abundance pattern was later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the membership of this star to the columba association which has an age of about 30myr is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite summarizes the age determinations for this star ( see table 1 therein ) which range from 30myr to 1.6gyr .",
    "the latter has been deduced from an asteroseismic study by @xcite .",
    "we adopted the most probable one , @xmath18100myr , as argued and analysed by @xcite .",
    "hr 8799 is hosting at least four planets and a massive dusty debris disk @xcite . the @xmath1 doradus type pulsation of hr 8799",
    "was studied by @xcite .",
    "they found four significant frequencies ( 1.9791 , 1.7268 , 1.6498 , and 0.2479d@xmath3 ) with corresponding amplitudes in johnson @xmath25 between 15.98 and 5.66mmag .",
    "@xcite concluded from a detailed asteroseismic study that hr 8799 is intrinsically metal - weak which is in contrary to the common accepted theory that the @xmath0 bootis phenomenon is restricted to the photosphere alone .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that there are at least two important free parameters ( the inclination angle and the correct mode identification ) which are vital for the asteroseismic analysis .",
    "such an intrinsic metal - weakness , compared to the sun , is still in the range which is found in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "if we accept this fact then also a non - solar isochrone has to be used to derive the age of hr 8799 .",
    "for a given temperature and luminosity , a lower metal isochrone would result in an older age .",
    "for the listed metallicity , it would naturally explain the often quoted discrepancy between the age of the columba association ( 30myr ) and some other determinations indicating an older age ( 100myr ) .",

    "we analysed the photometric data from wasp @xcite and the all sky automated survey ( asas , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surveys .",
    "the wasp data , with the time base of 1566  d , are strongly affected by instrumental artifacts .",
    "therefore , a fourier model with six harmonics was fitted to the data and measurements deviating more than 2@xmath29 were removed .",
    "this procedure was applied three times . for the asas data ( time base of 2545  d ) , no such procedure was necessary , but the best quality data with flag ` a ' and ` b ' were used and few outliers were removed manually . since asas gives information about the brightness in five different apertures , a weighted mean value was used . a frequency analysis was performed using period04 @xcite software , which was also used for the determination of the uncertainties via monte carlo simulations .",
    "asas data showed only five peaks : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath27 and two peaks with no clear interpretation .",
    "the latter are probably due to the intrinsic characteristics of the data set and the accuracy of the individual measurements . in the wasp data ,",
    "six significant peaks were identified ( see table [ frek ] ) . to estimate the reliability of these frequencies",
    ", the data were prewhitened with their various combinations .",
    "frequencies , which were left out , were always detected again .",
    "in addition , we performed the complete time series analysis for two sub data sets .",
    "the overall data set is divided by the time of observations to hjd 2450000 + [ 5137:5186 ] and [ 5500:5624 ] , respectively .",
    "this procedure should avoid the influence of seasonal effects on the fourier analysis and the detection of possible spurious frequencies . within the errors ,",
    "all frequencies listed in table [ frek ] were found in both data sets .    from fig .",
    "[ fourier ] it is apparent that frequency spectra are strongly affected by daily aliases , which can be expected when analysing data from single - side observations .",
    "this makes the frequency identification somewhat ambiguous and also @xmath30  d@xmath3 should be considered as possible frequencies . without any additional observations peaks can be hardly interpreted and it is only possible to guess potential scenarios .",
    "nevertheless , peaks with the highest amplitudes correspond to the same frequencies in asas and wasp data .",
    "therefore peaks that were identified ( table [ frek ] ) should be of higher reliability than their 1-day aliases .",
    "considering the frequencies in table [ frek ] , some interesting features appear .",
    "the peaks @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are almost equally spaced with @xmath31  d@xmath3 ( calculated as average of spacings between frequencies ) with respect to @xmath9 : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . since the spectral window of the data set ( fig .",
    "[ fourier ] detail in top panel ) do not show any suspicious peak near 0.1265  d@xmath3 , we consider this spacing as intrinsic to the pulsation of the star .",
    "this symmetrical pattern is similar to those of modulated rr  lyrae stars @xcite , where the side - peaks are products of amplitude and/or phase modulation of the basic pulsation frequency with modulation period corresponding to the spacing between these peaks ( in our case , @xmath35  d ) .",
    "such an interpretation of the frequency spectra , probably led to the misclassification of hd 54272 as a modulated rr lyrae type star with a pulsation period of 0.7789192  d ( @xmath36 in our identification , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as fig .",
    "[ phase ] shows , the mean amplitude of light changes is only about 0.06  mag , which is too small for rr  lyraes @xcite .",
    "however , omitting small amplitude and two other frequencies , which were found , the light curve shape could easily be interpreted as a modulated rr  lyrae star @xcite .",
    "we investigated if the found frequencies could be caused by rotation . from the observational point of view ,",
    "such rotational induced variability was never found for members of the @xmath0 bootis group before @xcite . in general , as further ingredients , a local stellar magnetic field which produces spots on the surface ( as well as elemental overabundaces ) and slow rotation in order to guarantee stability are needed @xcite .",
    "this so - called oblique rotator model @xcite , explains the variations as a geometrical effect as the star rotates , using a simple dipolar geometry . because hd  54272 is a very fast rotator and magnetic fields",
    "were never detected for @xmath0 bootis stars @xcite it is very unlikely that the oblique rotator model could be applied .",
    "based on the projected rotational velocity , radius ( table [ stars_param ] ) , and @xmath37=0@xmath21 as well as the formula by @xcite , we derive a rotational period of 0.45d for hd  54272 .",
    "larger values of the inclination would result in even shorter periods .",
    "the fastest rotating objects with periods close to 0.5d are very hot and high mass he - strong stars @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38  d@xmath3 aliases of the first five frequencies match the expected rotational period .",
    "also the regular spacing between frequencies could possibly be the consequence of rotation .",
    "however , if we assume that the variability is due to rotation then we need a new model to explain this phenomenon because the oblique rotator is , with our current knowledge , not applicable for hd  54272 .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the light curves of several thousands of a - type stars observed by the kepler space mission .",
    "he found that almost 10% of a - type stars exhibit variations resembling those usually attributed to starspots in cool stars , including a few exhibiting travelling waves usually interpreted as differentially rotating starspots .",
    "most of these variations can also not be explained by the above mentioned oblique rotator model .",
    "so , if we interpret the found variability of hd 54272 due to rotation , it would be the first @xmath0 bootis star with starspots on its surface which would be a challenging example for models .",
    "explanation of peaks corresponding to @xmath39 and @xmath40 as coupling terms , which are often reported in @xmath1 doradus stars @xcite and which implies nonlinearity in the oscillation ( similar behavior was reported in hr 8799 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fails , because @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not present in frequency spectra and none of daily aliases match the values needed for such consideration .",
    "furthermore , we checked the location of our target within the @xmath43 versus @xmath44 diagram which is sensitive to surface gravity @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "we used data for ` normal ' @xcite , @xmath0 bootis @xcite , and rr lyrae stars @xcite together with the standard relation from @xcite . the photometric indices were either taken from the listed references or from the catalogue by @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "hd 54272 and hr 8799 are located where the other @xmath0 bootis stars are situated .",
    "hr 8799 lies a little bit below the standard line which could be due to its young age and the surrounding dense circumstellar material .",
    "the @xmath0 bootis stars are clearly separated from the rr lyrae stars with two exceptions : hd 148638 and hd 193281 .",
    "both stars are rather close visual binary systems with almost equally bright companions .",
    "therefore , the available photometry could be influenced by the binarity .",
    "as a conclusion , the presented analysis clearly shows that hd 54272 is not a rr lyrae but a @xmath1 doradus pulsator without a hint of @xmath15 scuti variability @xcite .     according to epoch hjd 2455164.116 .",

    "<S> we detect the second known @xmath0 bootis star ( hd 54272 ) which exhibits @xmath1 doradus type pulsations . </S>",
    "<S> the star was formerly misidentified as a rr lyrae variable . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 bootis stars are a small group ( only 2% ) of late b to early f - type , population i stars which show moderate to extreme ( up to a factor 100 ) surface underabundances of most fe - peak elements and solar abundances of lighter elements ( c , n , o , and s ) . the photometric data from the wide angle search for planets ( wasp ) and all sky automated survey ( asas ) projects were analysed . </S>",
    "<S> they have an overlapping time base of 1566  d and 2545  d , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> six statistically significant peaks were identified ( @xmath2d@xmath3 , @xmath4d@xmath3 , @xmath5d@xmath3 , @xmath6d@xmath3 , @xmath7d@xmath3 and @xmath8d@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spacing between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 is almost identical . since the daily aliasing is very strong , the interpretation of frequency spectra is somewhat ambiguous . from spectroscopic data , </S>",
    "<S> we deduce a high rotational velocity ( 250@xmath1325kms@xmath3 ) and a metal deficiency of about @xmath140.8 to @xmath141.1dex compared to the sun . a comparison with the similar star , hr 8799 , results in analogous pulsational characteristics but widely different astrophysical parameters . since both are @xmath0 bootis type stars , the main mechanism of this phenomenon , selective accretion , may severely influence @xmath1 doradus type pulsations .    </S>",
