    "however , on a smaller mass scale , in systems that have a mass comparable to the milky way mass or smaller , central smbhs may become less common as bulges become less common ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2006 ) , and in some instances they disappear entirely , such as in the case of m33 ( merritt et al .",
    "2001 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ) , and ngc 205 ( valluri et al . 2005 ) . many of these bulgeless stellar systems host a nuclear star cluster instead .",
    "nuclear star clusters are found in late - type spirals ( boker et al . 2002 ) , and dwarf elliptical galaxies ( cote et al .",
    "this changeover may be the result of a competition between the smbh and nuclear star cluster for the same gas reservoir .",
    "nayakshin et al.(2009 ) shows that in massive galaxies with a spheroid velocity dispersion of @xmath8 @xmath9 150 @xmath10 , gas accretion onto the black hole dominates and a smbh forms , while in galaxies with lower velocity dispersions , star formation generates a nuclear cluster .",
    "note that such a star cluster does not exclude presence of an underweight smbh ( nayakshin et al .",

    "it s not clear , though , when exactly these bh seeds emerge or what mass they have at birth .",
    "smbh seeds may have been spawned from the accretion of low angular momentum gas in a dark matter halo ( koushiappas et al .",

    "2004 , miller @xmath5 colbert 2004 , van der marel 2004 ) or they could even be primordial ( mack et al . 2007 ) . however , the most likely candidates for smbh seeds are the remnants that form from the first generation of stars sitting deep within dark matter halos ( madau @xmath5 rees 2001 , heger et al .",

    "structure formation dictates that dark matter halos form in the early universe and hierarchically merge into larger bound objects , so naturally as dark matter halos merge , seed black holes sink to the center through dynamical friction and eventually coalesce .    gas accretion is thought to play a critical role in fueling the early stages of black hole growth ( david et al .",

    "are thought to be especially gas - rich , each merger brings a fresh supply of gas to the center of the galaxy , and new fuel to the growing supermassive black hole ( mihos @xmath5 hernquist 1994 , di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ) . from a combination of gas accretion and binary black hole coalescence ,",
    "it is thought that these pop iii - generated seeds may form the smbhs we observe today ( soltan 1982 , schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) .    during a galaxy merger ,",
    "each black hole sinks to the center of the new galaxy potential due to dynamical friction and eventually becomes bound as a binary ( kazantzidis et al .",
    "2005 ; escala et al .",
    "dynamical friction then continues to shrink the orbit until the binary is hard ( i.e , the separation between each black hole , a@xmath13 , is such that the system tends to lose energy during stellar encounters ) ( heggie et al .",
    "2007 ) . thereafter",
    ", further decay is mediated by 3-body scattering with the ambient stellar background until the binary becomes so close that the orbit can lose energy via gravitational radiation . in studies of static , spherical potentials",
    ", it may be difficult for stellar encounters alone to cause the binary to transition between the 3-body scattering phase and the gravitational radiation regime ( milosavljevic @xmath5 merritt 2003 ) .",
    "however , in gas - rich or non - spherical systems , the binary rapidly hardens and coalesces into one black hole , emitting copious gravitational radiation in the process ( mayer et al .",

    "2006 , sigurdsson 2003 , holley - bockelmann @xmath5 sigurdsson 2006 ) .",
    "unless the black hole binaries stall at the final parsec , the longest timescale governing the coalescence of two black holes occurs when the host galaxies themselves are still merging . here",
    ", the dynamical evolution of two merging galaxies is driven by the combined effect of _ dynamical friction _ , which brings the less massive galaxy , or satellite , to the center of the larger halo , or primary , and _ tidal interaction _ which strips mass from the satellite and further delays the merger ( e.g. richstone 1976 , aguilar @xmath5 white 1986 , holley - bockelmann @xmath5 richstone 1999 , taffoni et al .",
    "if the dynamical friction timescale is longer than a hubble time , the black holes carried by their host galaxies will not sink close enough to form a binary .",
    "sijacki et al .",
    "2007 and di matteo et al . 2008 have performed state - of - the - art high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological structure formation , following the growth of high mass smbhs at the centers of massive elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "their research was followed by similar semi - analytic work that incorporates a full treatment of dark matter dynamics , radiative gas cooling , star formation and energy feedback processes ( somerville et al . 2008 ) . in this very elegant approach , the smbh accretes gas through a _",
    "quasar mode _",
    " nearly eddington rate accretion following a galaxy merger ( croton et al .",
    "2006 )  and a _ radio mode _  bondi - hoyle accretion associated with relativistic jets ( somerville et al .",
    "both modes produce feedback that heats the surrounding gas . in this model",
    ", the feedback stops the accretion and locks the growth of the smbhs to the fundamental plane . at the same time , the feedback also quenches the star formation , which explains the observed shallow metallicity , stellar density and entropy profiles .",
    "however , it has recently been suggested that the implementation and importance of agn feedback may need to be reexamined ( ostriker et al .",
    "also , radiation fields and winds produced by massive stars may provide the dominant feedback ( hopkins et al .",
    "in fact , it is worth mentioning that agn feedback is just one of many feedback processes occurring in galaxy centers ; supernovae , star formation , and galaxy mergers produce feedback as well ( sinha @xmath5 holley - bockelmann 2010 ) .",
    "it is not clear which feedback process contributes the most to the evolution of a given galaxy .",
    "as well - developed as the current effort to understand smbh growth is , most work has focused on growing the most massive smbhs , found predominantly in dense environments . in a local group environment",
    "though , the galaxy morphology , dynamics , and star formation history are all dramatically different .",
    "smaller stellar systems such as disk and dwarf galaxies , have smbhs with lower masses ( @xmath0 10@xmath2 ) or no smbhs at all for bulgeless galaxies like m33 . in cosmological simulations ,",
    "agn feedback models create significant uncertainties for black hole growth in these lower mass halos ( booth @xmath5 schaye 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , smbhs in the local group are currently subluminous , implying a different relationship with gas consumption , at least in the present epoch , than the more massive end of the smbh mass spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , mergers are still expected to provide a key mechanism to channel gas to the galactic center . while `` cold mode '' gas accretion ( keres et al .",
    "2005 , dekel et al .",
    "2009 ) can channel large amounts of cold gas ( @xmath14 k ) to the galactic disk , this gas may not fuel the smbh . indeed ,",
    "high resolution n - body - sph simulations of milky way formation show that most of the gas that is accreted originates from major mergers ; even during the `` radio mode '' , where the gas is accreted by a bondi - hoyle mechanism , the gas reservoir is stocked not from the cold mode , but from the major mergers the milky way finished billions of years ago ( j. bellovary , private communication ) .",
    "hence , galaxy mergers appear to drive smbh growth in a wide range of masses .",
    "one problem that can preferentially plague low mass galaxies is gravitational wave recoil .",
    "recent calculations of binary black hole mergers indicate that gravitational wave recoil can kick a newly merged black hole with a speed as large as @xmath154000@xmath10 ( herrmann et al .",

    "2007 , campanelli et al .",
    "2007 , schnittman @xmath5 buonanno 2007 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the gravitational wave recoil imparted during any given merger depends on the mass ratio of each black hole , the spin magnitude and orientation with respect to the binary orbital plane , as well as the eccentricity of the orbit ( campanelli et al .",
    "2007 , schnittman @xmath5 buonanno 2007 , baker et al .",
    "2007 ) . while certain spin alignment mechanisms ( bogdanovic et al .",
    "2007 , dotti et al .",
    "2010 ) could allow massive galaxies to retain their smbhs , even moderate kicks can eject a growing smbh from dwarf or high redshift galaxies ( merritt et al .",
    "2004 , micic et al . 2006 , volonteri 2007 , schnittman 2007 , sesana 2007 , volonteri et al .",
    "there is tentative observations that suggest that gravitational wave recoil can indeed eject a smbh from its host ( komossa et al .",
    "given the greater vulnerability to recoil , the questionable importance of agn feedback , and lack of smbh in some galaxies , one can argue that smbh growth may be substantially different for these lightest smbhs in local group type of environments .",
    "in this paper we use via lactea 2 ( vl-2 ) evolutionary tracks to begin with an n - body merger tree that mimics the assembly of the milky way halo ( diemand et al .",
    "2007,2008 ) .",
    "upon this numerical merger tree we paint semi - analytic recipes for the galaxy and black hole growth .",
    "we follow two different merger driven recipes .",
    "the first approach is inspired by recent semi - analytic and numerical work on black hole growth ( somerville et al .",

    "2005 , 2007 ) . here ,",
    "smbhs grow slowly through low - level bondi - hoyle gas accretion tempered by agn feedback  the radio mode ; this growth is punctuated by rapid eddington gas accretion triggered by a major merger  the quasar mode .",
    "this approach has been used to explain smbh growth in massive stellar systems but not the growth of massive black holes in the local group . here , smbh growth is limited by the black hole fundamental plane .",
    "hence , hereafter we call this approach fundamental plane limited ( fpl ) . in the second recipe ,",
    "we introduce a model for prolonged black hole gas accretion physically motivated by galaxy dynamics . in this model , the subgrid physics ( stellar and agn feedback , as well as accretion disk microphysics )",
    "is bundled into one parameter for gas accretion efficiency that can be constrained by future small - scale , fully general relativistic magneto - hydrodynamic agn simulations . with this approach , gas accretion onto the black hole",
    "is based on the dynamics of the galaxy merger  fast at high rate for major mergers and prolonged at low rate for more minor mergers .",
    "this model does not use the black hole fundamental plane or the m - @xmath8 relation to limit black hole growth . during a minor merger ,",
    "the accretion time scale is longer , but the accretion rate is lower , since less gas is driven toward the bh by a smaller global perturbation . for major mergers , the accretion rate increases , though in practice it never reaches the eddington rate .",
    "we call this approach prolonged gas accretion ( pga ) .",
    "in addition to gas accretion , black holes grow through mergers with other black holes too . in both recipes ,",
    "we model smbh growth from direct mergers including gravitational recoil .",
    "since the recoil velocity is highly dependent on bh",
    "spin and orientation , we create @xmath15 20,000 merger trees to examine the combination of bh spin parameters that favors the @xmath16  @xmath8 relation at redshift zero .",
    "the key difference between fpl and pga models is in the implementation of agn feedback . in fpl",
    ", the black hole fundamental plane is used to calibrate agn feedback . in pga",
    ", we use agn feedback to suppresses the efficiency of gas accretion , while calibration parameters come from detailed small scale simulations of galaxy merger remnants .",

    "in this paper , we use publicly - available vl-2 evolutionary tracks ( diemand et al . 2007,2008 ) .",
    "vl-2 is the highest resolution cosmological n - body simulation of milky way formation and evolution , and evolves a @xmath17cdm universe with wmap3 parameters ( @xmath18=0.238 , @xmath19=0.762 , @xmath20=0.74 and h=0.7 ) .",
    "the high resolution region of vl-2 is embedded within a periodic box with a comoving length of 40 mpc .",
    "the evolutionary tracks consist of the time evolution from z=27.54 to z=0 of @xmath15 20,000 dark matter halos identified at redshift z=4.56 .",

    "we test two fundamentally different models for smbh growth : fundamental plane limited ( fpl ) and prolonged gas accretion ( pga ) . in fpl , gas accretion onto the black hole",
    "is controlled by agn feedback in such way that the smbh mass does not grow above the black hole fundamental plane at any time . in pga",
    ", we bundle star formation and agn feedback , as well as accretion disk microphysics together into gas accretion efficiency parameter ; the mass is not restricted to lie on the black hole fundamental plane .",
    "our only guideline is the mass of sgr a * observed today . since the mass of the smbh at the center of the milky way is well - constrained , we can identify which physical processes during the growth are most important for the final black hole mass and test their parameter space .",
    "the first of these parameters applies to both models : the black hole seed s initial mass function ( bhmf ) .",
    "we test various bhmfs and various values for the minimum and maximum black hole seed mass . a second effect that is present in both models",

    "we test various values for average mass accretion rate during this radio mode .",
    "since the bondi - hoyle mechanism is commonly used , we may occasionally address this quiescent part of smbh growth as the bondi - hoyle phase , but our approach does not depend on the actual growth mechanism here . in the pga model , the third parameter is the gas accretion efficiency . in our implementation",

    "we adopt an average bondi - hoyle accretion rate during the radio mode over a hubble time . the bondi - hoyle accretion rate in our model",
    "is averaged over all radio mode phases the galaxy goes through and since it explicitly excludes agn feedback which would blow away the gas , the bondi - hoyle accretion rate we use is a lower constraint . if we model agn feedback , the derived accretion rates would be higher .",

    "the first is a more conservative criterion that allows black holes to accrete gas if the mass ratio of the host dark matter halo is less than 4:1  a major merger .",
    "the second case sets an upper constraint on the final black hole mass by allowing gas accretion as long as the merging dark matter halos have a mass ratio less than 10:1  on the cusp of what is considered a minor merger . since our black holes merged promptly after the halos merged , the accretion timescale and efficiency for major mergers was the same regardless of the mass ratio or redshift .    in this paper",
    ", we continue to model the black hole growth as one of extended gas accretion excited by major mergers . at high redshift ,",

    "integrated over the whole of a black hole lifetime , though , this major merger - driven gas accretion is likely to be the dominant source of gas inflow .",
    "since the black hole growth is so strongly dependent on what fuel is driven to the center during galaxy mergers , it is important to characterize this merger - driven mass growth , including the critical gas physics that may inhibit or strengthen this nuclear supply .",

    "lower recoil k2 models , the slope m is 1.14 and 1.06 , close to @xmath120 / @xmath119 = 10@xmath125 .",
    "pga models predict an even shallower slope of 0.64 in k1 and 0.80 in the case of lower recoil velocities k2 .",
    "this tests the pga model by predicting a substantially flatter mass function for lower mass smbh .",
    "we do point that these differences between fpl and pga models might be insignificant , considering that scatter around the linear fits is substantial .",
    "rogue black holes are carried into the milky way halo by their host satellites , but have halo merger time scales longer than a hubble time . over the span of the simulation ,",
    "the milky way accretes 669 satellite halos which host a black hole , and 249 have orbital decay times that are longer than a hubble time ( see figure 1 and figure 4 for the merger time scale , merger rate and mass ratios of these halos ) . by redshift zero ,",
    "then , these halos are still orbiting at significant distances from the center of milky way  and although the halos themselves have been stripped by the primary potential , they still host massive black holes .",
    "figure 13 shows the number of rogue black holes as a function of mass for the fpl ( left ) and pga ( right ) models . as before ,",
    "the upper limit for black hole mass excludes kicks and is presented in red in both panels . for each kick model",
    ", we also present the number of rogue black holes with the typical mass over the realizations .",
    "the pga model predicts that there should be at least one massive rogue black hole in the milky way halo with mass in range 10@xmath3 -10@xmath2 .",
    "the distance from the milky way center in all models is correlated with the redshift at which galaxies merge ( figure 14 ) .",
    "if the merger occurred early at high redshift , the black hole had more time to sink to the center , and for mergers close to z=0 , the black hole has just entered milky way halo .",
    "the redshift at which the halo merges with the milky way also marks the end of the rogue black hole growth .",
    "hence , rogue black holes that enter the milky way at later times have had more time to grow , and will be more massive than those accreted through early mergers . figures 15 and 16 show how rogue black hole mass , satellite merger redshift , and distance from the milky way are correlated .",
    "figure 15 represents the fpl model and figure 16 represents the pga model .",
    "k1 realizations are shown in the left panels , and lower recoil k2 realizations in the right .",
    "unfortunately , both figures clearly show that the most massive rogue black holes are furthest away and may be very difficult to observe .",
    "we estimate the bondi accretion onto these black holes to determine how observable they may be and we describe the process below .",
    "there is sufficient evidence that the halos of galaxies , from massive ellipticals to isolated spirals , can host diffuse hot halo gas ( matthews @xmath5 brighenti 2003 , osullivan et al .",
    "2001 , pedersen et al .",
    "2006 ) . as these black holes orbit within the primary halo",
    ", they can accrete from this ambient hot halo gas via bondi - hoyle accretion . here",
    ", the mass accretion rate can then be described by :    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the density of the halo gas , @xmath128 is the gas sound speed , and @xmath129 is the velocity of the black hole . for these rogue black holes ,",
    "we add this more quiescent form of accretion from the time the black hole has entered the virial radius of the halo in order to determine whether any may be visible today .",
    "to model the hot halo gas , we use a technique outlines in sinha & holley - bockelmann ( 2009 ) . in short , we assume it has an isothermal density profile consistent with x - ray observations of halo gas in ellipticals ( matthews @xmath5 brighenti 2003 ) , and that the ideal gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential of the halo .",
    "we assume a gas core radius of @xmath130 , where r@xmath131 is the scale radius of the nfw halo , and that the gas temperature is the virial temperature at the virial radius .",
    "this yields a central gas temperature of @xmath132 for a dark matter halo of mass @xmath133 , which is also consistent with observations ( pedersen et al .",
    "at redshift zero , we assume the black holes are on bound elliptical orbits of eccentricity @xmath134 to match simulation predictions for satellite mergers ( e.g. ghigna et al .",
    "1998 , sales et al . 2007 ) .    by redshift zero",
    ", these black holes will have grown to a new mass , m@xmath135 , and will have a new accretion rate from equation  [ eqn : bondi ] .",
    "the radiated luminosity from this process can be determined from l@xmath136 , where @xmath137 describes how efficiently mass is converted to energy ; the standard assumption for an accretion disk around a spinning black hole sets @xmath138 ( shakura @xmath5 syunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "we find that our most massive rogue black hole m@xmath135 = 227,643 @xmath24 , residing at 225 kpc from the galactic center , can radiate at 3,834 @xmath139 ( figure 17 , pga panels on the right ) , making it somewhat fainter than the brightest ulxs ; the fact that the hot halo gas is so tenuous at these radii is what accounts for the relatively low luminosity .",
    "however , if these rogue black holes are common , they will be observable in the outskirts of the milky way halo with chandra , and the most luminous can have sufficient signal - to - nose for spectral characterization .",
    "note , though , that a significant fraction of these may have advection - dominated accretion flows , rather than thin accretion disks , and hence @xmath137 may be much less than 0.1 ; this would naturally make the black hole less luminous , but with a harder spectral signature .",
    "it has also been suggested that rogue black holes in the molecular or cold neutral part of the ism should be more easily detected in the radio than in x - rays ( maccarone 2004 , maccarone et al . 2005 ) .",
    "maccarone 2005 , for example , calculates that a 2,600 @xmath24 black hole should be observable with lofar ( above 30@xmath140jy ) in the radio out to about 15 kpc ",
    "much closer than the most massive rogue black hole in our model . assuming larger black hole velocities and a more efficient bondi accretion rate , rogue black holes may be observed at even larger distances .",
    "even if they are not observable electromagnetically , they may be detected by mesolensing ( di stefano 2007 ) .",
    "as the smbh grows , incoming black holes are kicked from the center of the host halo , forming a population of `` ejected '' black holes .",
    "figure 18 shows the cumulative number of black holes lost from the merger tree due to kicks larger than the escape velocity in the top panels , and the ejected black hole mass as a function of redshift on the bottom panels .",
    "again , we show the fpl model on the left and our pga model on the right .",
    "the redshift of the last smbh ejection is between z=2 - 3 for the pga model , and between z=3 - 4 for the fpl model .",
    "when we compare the difference in total numbers of ejected bhs between k1 and lower recoil k2 realizations ( upper panels in figure 18 ) , both the fpl and pga model predict the the k1 case ejects up to 50@xmath114 more black holes .",
    "the average masses of ejected black holes are similar in the fpl and pga models ( bottom panels in figure 18 ) with the most common ejected black hole of 100 - 1,000 @xmath24 .",
    "the mass ratio of merging black holes sets the kick amplitude , with large differences between the incoming black hole mass creating a small kick .",
    "the typical number of ejected black holes per realization as a function of mass ratio is presented in figure 19 .",
    "the fpl and pga distributions are again very similar regardless of the kick distribution .",
    "the main difference is that higher mass ratio encounters are more common in the pga k1 model . since the growth of black holes in the fpl model is very efficient  at eddington rate ",
    "the incoming black holes grow faster and this decreases the mass ratio when the merger occurs . hence , there are more mergers at q @xmath0 0.3 in fpl k1 and more mergers at q @xmath9 0.3 in pga k1",
    ".    some of the ejected massive black holes might contribute to the rogue black hole population .",
    "micic et al .",
    "2006 has shown that high redshift ejections of black holes from their host halos in the local group type environment could lead to their capture by milky way potential .",
    "tracking these black holes are beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed in future work .",
    "using a very high resolution small volume cosmological n - body simulation ( via lactea ii ) , we construct the merger history of black holes in low mass dark matter halos in a local group analog .",
    "we found that the method used to estimate the dynamical friction timescale makes a large difference in the total rate and redshift distribution of black hole mergers ( see also holley - bockelmann et al .",
    "in particular , for example , an n - body based dynamical friction estimate ( boylan - kolchin 2008 ) yields longer merger timescales than does chandrasekhar dynamical friction .",
    "these larger , more realistic merger timescales will postpone black hole mergers to lower redshifts . moreover ,",
    "if most of the black hole growth is tied to gas accretion that is activated by major mergers , then using chandrasekhar dynamical friction will overestimate the black hole mass .",
    "we studied the growth and merger rate of black holes from seeds at redshift @xmath15 20 to low mass smbhs at redshift zero , analytically incorporating the important sub - resolution physics to model the black hole dynamics and gas accretion .",
    "we find that having a constant mass black hole seeds , or a narrow bhmf leads to nearly equal mass ratio black hole mergers .",
    "these mergers have largest gravitational wave recoil velocities , which eject the black holes from their host galaxies and suppresses smbh growth .",
    "a wider range bhmf presents far fewer problems in growing smbhs , even when the black holes spins are large .",
    "many groups are beginning to explore the formation and evolution of massive supermassive black holes in large volume cosmological volumes , with a sophisticated and self - consistent treatment of the sub - grid physics ( e.g. croton et al .",
    "2006 , sijacki et al .",
    "2007 , di matteo et al .",
    "2008 , sijacki et al .",
    "2009 ) . with larger simulation volumes , these simulations are capable of forming hundreds of massive smbhs at the centers of massive elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "in fact , the fpl model we adopt is a semi - analytic model ( somerville et al . 2008 ) resulting from these techniques . due to high computational cost",
    ", however , the same numerical approach has not been applied in smaller cosmological volumes where the bulk of the halo evolution is non - linear . here , high redshift dwarf galaxies merge to form the local group galaxies , and massive black holes have masses well below 10@xmath1 .",
    "we use small volume nbody simulations and apply two semi - analytic recipes for smbh growth .",
    "one class of models is always limited by the black hole fundamental plane ( fpl ) . here",
    ", the growing black hole mass is a function of the total stellar mass in the galaxy bulge .",
    "this approach has successfully produced smbhs in massive galaxies .",
    "we show that the fpl model can also be used for black hole growth in small volumes . in particular ,",
    "black hole mergers combined with a ) gas accretion in a quasar mode and b ) a time averaged bondi - hoyle accretion rate of 7 @xmath107yr@xmath108 in a radio mode , can produce the observed mass of the sgr a * smbh .",
    "today , the observed sgr a * accretion rate is an order of magnitude less efficient than this radio mode accretion rate , but this may not be unreasonable , since the milky way is not considered an agn anymore .",
    "other low mass agns in the local universe are observed to have 10 - 100 times more efficient gas accretion .",
    "the fpl model , by design , guarantees the formation of a fundamental plane black hole .",
    "however , in reality , not every galaxy has such a system , due to the competition between black hole growth and nuclear star cluster formation in low mass spheroids .",
    "we have proposed an alternative method which could provide deeper insight into the formation of the lightest supermassive black holes ( @xmath010@xmath1 ) by incorporating growth prescriptions calculated in small scale merger simulations .",
    "gas accretion onto the black hole is always suppressed by stellar or agn feedback , and depends on the structure of the gas , as well as the microphysics ( such as turbulence , fully relativistic magnetohydrodynamics , etc ) that is currently physically beyond modeling .",
    "our model provides a framework into which the microphysics can easily be incorporated once simulations and observations reveal the nature of these processes .",
    "in contrast , in the fpl model , these effects are irrelevant , since gas accretion occurs in the same manner in all @xmath0 10:1 galaxy mergers .",
    "the final outcome is always a fundamental plane black hole since feedback rapidly drives the evolution of fundamental plane rather than the growth of black holes . in the pga model",
    ", we can incorporate an accretion efficiency parameter into the gas accretion prescription to make black hole growth less efficient for stronger feedback and vice versa .",
    "we use a formalism that relates the gas accretion efficiency to galaxy merger ratios ; gas accretion is most efficient for major mergers and negligible for minor mergers ( cox et al .",
    "in addition , minor mergers will last much longer than equal mass mergers .",
    "when these two effects combine , the pga model produces short bursts of high rate gas accretion for equal mass mergers , and long , slow gas accretion for 10:1 mass ratio mergers . as a result",
    ", most black holes in the pga model never reach the eddington rate .",
    "we also modeled the effect of gravitational wave recoil on assembling the lightest smbhs .",
    "one way to mitigate gravitational wave recoil is to increase the black hole merger symmetry ; smooth dense gas , for example , may quickly align the spin vectors of each smbh before coalescence ( bogdanovic et al . 2007 , dotti et al .",
    "2010 ) . in order to understand how damaging gravitational wave recoil can be , and to pin down the epoch that a growing black hole is most vulnerable to recoil , we do not pre - select the merger configurations with the lowest recoils in k1 and select spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum in lower recoil model k2 . in previous work ,",
    "when black holes are merging in massive stellar systems , the large gravitational potential creates large escape velocities .",
    "hence , a k2 kick distribution with much lower recoil velocities helps retain the central black holes ( volonteri et al .",
    "in our merger tree , most of the dark matter halos have masses below 10@xmath141 , and the typical halo mass is 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath34 .",
    "since the escape velocities in these systems are below 100 @xmath10 , even the moderate kicks will eject the smbh . when gravitational recoil is included in the fpl model , the final black hole mass",
    "is unaffected in most cases .",
    "this is the consequence of the fpl requirement of a very high gas accretion efficiency . even in the most damaging k1 realization where the black hole is ejected twice from the merger tree ,",
    "the accretion of gas is so efficient that a @xmath142 black hole that is ushered to the center has time to grow to 2@xmath2210@xmath2 .",
    "when gravitational recoil is included in the pga model , the final mass of the central black hole in the k1 realizations is lower by roughly an order of magnitude than in k2 ( lower recoil model ) .",
    "90 @xmath114 of the k2 realizations are in the sgr a * mass range .",
    "pga model predicts that kicks have to follow lower distribution of gravitational recoil velocities , k2 .",
    "when we look at the mass of the black holes at the centers of local field dwarf galaxies , none of the models , fpl or pga , matches the extrapolation of the ferrarese ( 2002 ) , relation which relates black hole masses to the masses of host dark matter halos .",
    "even when we remove gas accretion as a mechanism for black hole growth , their masses will be larger than predicted by ferrarese relation as the result of seed black hole mergers , despite the fact that the initial black hole seeds were pop iii remnants and therefore considered light seeds .",
    "it is possible that the black hole fundamental plane exists for low mass smbhs in field dwarf galaxies , but it may simply have a different slope than for high mass smbhs ; indeed this was alluded to in the original ferrarese work .",
    "we do find a shallower slope in all models . in fpl ,",
    "the slope is close linear and tracks the following proportion : m@xmath98 / m@xmath41 = 10@xmath125 .",
    "the pga model predicts an even shallower slope  0.64 - 0.80  although the scatter caused by gravitational wave recoil makes it hard to distinguish between fpl and pa .",
    "note that gas consumption in field dwarf galaxies may favor nuclear star cluster formation rather than a massive black hole .",
    "both fpl and pga models are consistent with this picture since roughly half the dwarfs contain no central black hole , though the pga models predict more empty halos on average than fpl .",
    "it is important to note that the black hole demographics in the dwarf galaxy regime is critical to distinguish between the fpl and pga models .",
    "we also identified two massive rogue black hole populations .",
    "first , we find ejected black holes , or black holes with kick velocities larger than the host halo escape velocity .",
    "we will address the properties of this population with a detailed treatment of their dynamics in the future .",
    "the second are rogue black holes from the remnants of satellites that had merger timescales longer than a hubble time .",
    "we find hundreds of these rogue black holes at distances of @xmath15 200 kpc from the galactic center and with masses from 10 - 10@xmath3 ( depending on the model ) .",
    "the most massive of these may be detected in x - ray and are possible mesolensing candidates .",
    "these two populations of black holes , which have quite different formation mechanisms , might not be easily disentangled .",
    "it is possible that a growing primary halo may recapture black hole ejected by recoil , in which case both populations occupy a similar parameter space ( micic et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "our model successfully reproduces sgr a * without limiting the black hole growth to the black hole fundamental plane .",
    "it predicts that kicks have to follow lower recoil velocity distribution ( k2 ) .",
    "it also predicts a substantially flatter mass function ( slope = 0.64  0.8 ) for lower mass smbh in local field dwarfs .",
    "it predicts milky way rogue black holes , and a population of ejected black holes .",
    "this model provides cosmological framework into which the results of small scale simulations can easily be incorporated in the future . at this point ,",
    "the model is limited only by the lack of understanding of how various feedback mechanisms couple with each other and with the gas accretion onto the black hole .",
    "there is ample ground to cover in this respect .",
    "as one example , ostriker et al .",
    "( 2010 ) claim that all previous studies of smbh growth may overestimate the final black hole mass by @xmath15 two orders of magnitude by treating only the energy part of agn feedback , neglecting the importance of momentum and mechanical feedback .",
    "hopefully , this will be resolved in the future .",
    "one issue is how well the vl-2 simulation represents the milky way merger history .",
    "the reality is that vl-2 represents one out many possible evolutionary histories of the local group , and not necessarily the correct one .",
    "the fact that only major mergers activate the quasar mode means that the number of major mergers each galaxy goes through has a huge impact on the black hole accretion history .",
    "this underlines the importance of approaching the problem of sgr a * growth statistically by simulating hundreds of highly resolved small simulation volumes . to resolve thousands of milky way mass halos with vl-2 resolution , gas physics , and black hole dynamics implemented on the fly",
    "will be computationally too expensive in the near future .",

    "<S> we explore the growth of @xmath010@xmath1 black holes that reside at the centers of spiral and field dwarf galaxies in a local group type of environment . </S>",
    "<S> we use merger trees from a cosmological n - body simulation known as via lactea ii ( vl-2 ) as a framework to test two merger - driven semi - analytic recipes for black hole growth that include dynamical friction , tidal stripping , and gravitational wave recoil in over 20,000 merger tree realizations . </S>",
    "<S> first , we apply a fundamental plane limited ( fpl ) model to the growth of sgr a * , which drives the central black hole to a maximum mass limited by the black hole fundamental plane after every merger . </S>",
    "<S> next , we present a new model that allows for low - level prolonged gas accretion ( pga ) during the merger . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both models can generate a sgr a * mass black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we predict a population of massive black holes in local field dwarf galaxies  if the vl-2 simulation is representative of the growth of the local group , we predict up to 35 massive black holes ( @xmath0 10@xmath2 ) in local group field dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict that hundreds of @xmath0 10@xmath3 black holes fail to merge , and instead populate the milky way halo , with the most massive of them at roughly the virial radius . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that there may be hundreds of massive black holes ejected from their hosts into the nearby intergalactic medium due to gravitational wave recoil . we discuss how the black hole population in the local group field dwarfs may help to constrain the growth mechanism for sgr a*.    local group , agn feedback , supermassive black holes , dark matter halos , gravitational recoil , n - body simulations </S>"
