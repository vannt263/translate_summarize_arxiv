    "nonrotating black holes with both mass and charge have two horizons : the outer horizon is the actual event horizon of the black hole , while the inner horizon is unstable to small perturbations , and is conjectured to become singular in any realistic situation.@xcite for such black holes the charge is always less than or equal to the mass , with the special case of charge equals mass called an extreme black hole . in the limit as the charge approaches the mass , the two horizons merge .",
    "thus , as pointed out by marolf@xcite one might expect that in some sense extreme black holes have singular event horizons .",
    "more precisely , it is claimed in @xcite that an observer crossing the event horizon encounters a singularity a short time later and that this short time goes to zero in the limit of extremality .",
    "the treatment of @xcite used an eternal black hole , whereas physical black holes are formed by gravitational collapse . in this paper",
    "we treat the problem of nearly extreme black holes formed by gravitational collapse . for simplicity ,",
    "we use collapse of a charged thin shell .",
    "we then consider a free fall observer who falls into such a black hole at late times and calculate the time it takes for him to reach the singularity .",
    "methods and results are presented in section 2 and conclusions are presented in section 3 .",
    "a charged , nonrotating , black hole is described by the reissner - nordstrom metric @xmath0 where the quantity @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the mass and charge of the black hole .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 vanishes at the outer and inner horizons of the black hole , which are located respectively at @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 the coordinate system in eqn.([rn ] ) becomes singular at the horizons , thus to describe the process of gravitational collapse and black hole formation , we need a different coordinate system .",
    "we therefore use eddington - finkelstein coordinates ( @xmath8 ) where @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 in these coordinates the reissner - nordstrom metric becomes @xmath11    the coordinate @xmath9 is constant along ingoing light rays .",
    "one can also define an analogous coordinate @xmath12 which is constant along outgoing light rays . with a series of coordinate patches of this type",
    ", one can cover the extended reissner - nordstrom spacetime , which is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) . however , the extended reissner - nordstrom spacetime is too large to represent what actually happens in gravitational collapse .",
    "this is for two different reasons : first when a charged , spherical object collapses , it is only the spacetime outside the object that is described by the reissner - nordstrom metric .",
    "thus , to describe gravitational collapse , one must find the path of the outer surface of the collapsing object , and then cut out all parts of the diagram of fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) that are outside that surface and replace them with something appropriate for the interior of the collapsing object .",
    "the second reason is that small perturbations of the reissner - nordstrom solution blow up as @xmath13 ( which is also a null surface at @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , to get the appropriate diagram , one must replace this null surface with a null singularity and cut out all portions of the diagram to the future of this surface . in the end one",
    "obtains a restricted portion of the extended reissner - nordstrom spacetime , which can be covered by a single coordinate patch of the sort used in eqn .",

    "the outer and inner horizons are represented by solid lines at 45 degree angles to the vertical , while the timelike singularity is denoted by a dashed line ]    we want a simple model for gravitational collapse to form the black hole , so we choose a thin shell of charged dust .",
    "thin shells in general relativity are described by the israel formalism@xcite in which the history of the shell is a timelike hypersurface @xmath15 separating two spacetimes ( labeled @xmath16 and @xmath17 and which are respectively the exterior and the interior of the shell ) .",
    "the intrinsic metric @xmath18 is continuous , while the extrinsic curvature @xmath19 is discontinuous and satisfies @xmath20   = - 8 \\pi   \\left ( { t_{ab } } - { \\textstyle { \\frac 1 2 } } t { h_{ab } } \\right ) \\label{israelshell}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the delta function stress - energy of the shell . here ,",
    "for any quantity @xmath22 we define @xmath23= { \\phi _ + } -{\\phi _ -}$ ] where the quantity @xmath24 is @xmath22 on @xmath15 evaluated from the @xmath16 side ( and correspondingly for @xmath25 ) .",
    "the worldsheet of the shell is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the proper time of an observer in the shell .",
    "the stress - energy of the dust shell takes the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the four - velocity of the shell and @xmath30 is the shell s mass per unit area . as shown by de la cruz and israel@xcite , kuchar@xcite and chase@xcite eqn.([israelshell ] ) can be used to find the equation of motion of the shell as follows : the exterior of the shell is a reissner - nordstrom spacetime .",
    "spherical symmetry implies that the extrinsic curvature takes the form @xmath31 combining eqns .",

    "since the interior of the shell is minkowski spacetime , expressions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the shell interior are given by eqns ( [ beqn ] ) and ( [ ceqn ] ) with @xmath1 replaced by @xmath38 .",

    "then it follows from eqn .",
    "( [ motion2 ] ) that @xmath46 we also introduce the quantity @xmath47 defined by @xmath48 since we are considering nearly extremal black holes , @xmath49 .",

    "it is also true that the perturbed black hole becomes singular at @xmath53 .",
    "however , it is here that the use of eddington - finkelstein coordinates becomes essential . in the collapse process , there are two different null surfaces at @xmath14 , an outgoing null surface where @xmath9 is finite , and which is not singular , and an ingoing null surface which occurs in the limit as @xmath13 , and which is singular",
    ". the question then becomes , which of these surfaces does the shell cross first ? to answer this question , we note that there is a function @xmath55 such that on the worldsheet of the shell @xmath56 . then from eqn .",
    "( [ rnef ] ) it follows that @xmath57 and therefore that @xmath58 however , the null coordinate @xmath9 always increases towards the future , fixing the sign above to be plus , so we obtain @xmath59 note that in this equation , if @xmath60 when @xmath1 vanishes , then @xmath61 remains finite ; but if @xmath62 when @xmath1 vanishes then @xmath63 .",
    "since the shell starts out ingoing , and since it can not change direction between the two horizons ( where @xmath64 is a timelike coordinate ) then it follows that the shell first crosses @xmath53 at a place where @xmath9 remains finite , and where therefore the spacetime remains nonsingular . after crossing @xmath65 ,",
    "the shell reaches a minimum radius @xmath66 and then re - expands .",
    "it follows from eqn .",
    "( [ motion3 ] ) that @xmath67 where we have neglected any terms higher than zeroth order in @xmath47 . after reaching @xmath66 the shell re - expands , and eventually reaches @xmath53 .",
    "note , however , that this time the shell approaches @xmath53 with @xmath68 .",
    "it then follows from eqn .",
    "( [ dotv ] ) that @xmath9 diverges as @xmath69 and thus that the shell approaches the null singularity .",
    "the path of the shell in the usual penrose diagram of the reissner - nordstrom spacetime is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the shell clearly takes a non - neglible amount of proper time to encounter the singularity , and this will also be true of an observer who falls into the black hole shortly after it forms .",
    "however , as we will see , things are somewhat different for an observer who falls in at late times .",
    "since for such an observer , @xmath70 when the outer horizon is crossed , and since @xmath9 increases along future directed timelike curves , it follows that @xmath70 when the observer encounters the shell .",
    "therefore , we are led to consider the behavior of the shell at large @xmath9 . we know that as @xmath13 we have @xmath69 and therefore @xmath71",
    "however , we will need to know how rapidly @xmath71 at large @xmath9 . from eqn .",
    "( [ dotv ] ) it follows that on the shell we have @xmath72 then using eqns .",
    "( [ f ] ) and ( [ dvdr ] ) and neglecting any terms that are higher order in the small quantities @xmath1 and @xmath47 we find that on the shell at large @xmath9 we have @xmath73 the solution of this equation is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a constant . note that there are two separate regimes where this equation simplifies .",
    "for @xmath76 we have @xmath77 while for @xmath78 we have @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "we now consider the fate of a free - fall observer who falls into the black hole at late times .",
    "just as the shell has four - velocity @xmath80 , denote the four - velocity of the observer by @xmath81 . due to the time translation symmetry of the reissner - nordstrom spacetime",
    ", the observer has a conserved energy per unit mass @xmath82 given by @xmath83 since @xmath84 is a unit timelike vector , the same reasoning that led to eqn .",
    "( [ dotv ] ) yields @xmath85 using eqns .",
    "( [ energy ] ) and ( [ dotv2 ] ) we find @xmath86 at late times , the shell is approximately at @xmath53 and for the region in between @xmath54 and @xmath53 we have @xmath87 .",
    "thus the observer crosses the shell approximately a proper time @xmath88 after crossing the outer horizon .    to find the amount of proper time that it takes for the observer to encounter the singularity , we must also find the behavior of the observer in the interior of the shell . to begin with ,",
    "we calculate the quantity @xmath89 when the observer crosses the shell . from eqn .",
    "( [ rn ] ) we find @xmath90 then using eqns . ( [ dotv ] ) , ( [ dotv2 ] ) and ( [ vdotu ] ) we obtain @xmath91 since when the observer crosses the shell we have @xmath68 and @xmath92 it follows that to lowest order in @xmath47 @xmath93 and then using eqn .",
    "( [ motion3 ] ) we obtain @xmath94     path of the geodesic observer ( thin curve ) in the spacetime formed by the collapse of the thin shell . here",
    "nonsingular horizons are denoted by solid lines , and the null singularity by a dashed line ]    since @xmath1 is very small when the observer crosses the shell , it follows that @xmath89 is very large there .",
    "however , since @xmath84 satisfies the geodesic equation , and since the christoffel symbols in the thin shell spacetimes have only jumps rather than delta functions , it follows that @xmath84 is continuous across the shell .",
    "since the thin shell formalism also requires that the metric and @xmath29 are continuous across the shell , it follows that immediately upon entering the interior of the shell @xmath89 is still given by the expression in eqn .",
    "( [ vdotu4 ] ) .",
    "but the interior of the shell is minkowski spacetime , and the shell has @xmath95 so it follows from eqn .",
    "( [ vdotu4 ] ) that in the rest frame of the center of the shell , the observer is an ingoing geodesic with @xmath96 this is a very large @xmath97 factor , so even though the observer must travel a distance of @xmath98 ( to the center and back ) to encounter the singularity , this only takes a proper time of @xmath99 since @xmath1 is given by eqn .",
    "( [ flargev ] ) it follows that this is a very small proper time . the motion of the observer is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] )",
    "though the pictures drawn are somewhat different , our calculations agree with the main conclusion of @xcite .",
    "for a nearly extremal black hole formed by gravitational collapse an observer crossing the event horizon at late times almost immediately encounters a curvature singularity .",
    "note however , that this statement involves two different small numbers : @xmath47 which expresses how close to extremality the black hole is , and @xmath100 which measures how late the observer crosses the black hole event horizon .",
    "( here @xmath101 is the value of @xmath9 at which the observer crosses the horizon ) . in all cases , the proper time from event horizon",
    "to shell is of order @xmath102 .",
    "for @xmath103 the proper time from shell to singularity is of order @xmath104 , while for @xmath105 the proper time from shell to singularity is completely negligible .",
    "we now consider the effect the nature of the singularity could have on this result . throughout",
    ", we have assumed that the singularity is null .",
    "however , it is generally thought that when black holes form the singularity starts out null near the horizon and then becomes spacelike further inside the black hole .",
    "however , any such change would only serve to decrease the amount of time it would take for an observer to encounter the singularity , so the conclusion that the observer encounters the singularity almost immediately after crossing the event horizon remains true .",
    "finally note that the collapsing thin shell is only one simple model for the formation of a charged black hole by gravitational collapse .",
    "it would be interesting to consider other models ( _ e.g. _ the collapse of a charged scalar field ) to see whether the features found in the shell model continue to hold .",
