    "in two dimensions the melting from a crystal to an isotropic liquid can be a two - stage process @xcite , driven by the sequential unbinding of dislocations @xcite and disclinations @xcite . at low temperatures",
    "@xmath0 dislocations are suppressed due to their cost in elastic energy",
    ". however , their free energy decreases with increasing temperature . at a temperature @xmath1 ,",
    "the quasi - long - ranged translational order of the crystal is destroyed by the dissociation of dislocation pairs .",
    "this transition leads to an intervening hexatic phase , which still exhibits extended orientational correlations .",
    "the unbinding of disclination pairs sets in at a higher temperature @xmath2 . in this second transition",
    "the quasi - long - ranged orientational order of the hexatic phase is destroyed , leading to an isotropic liquid .",
    "this mechanism allows the melting transition to be continuous in contrast to the first - order melting ( directly to an isotropic fluid ) predicted by landau @xcite .",
    "several experimental systems have illuminated the nature of two - dimensional melting .",
    "a nearly ideal system is electrons on helium @xcite .",
    "the electrons are trapped on the surface of liquid helium by a submerged , positively charged capacitor plate .",
    "their separations are rarely less than 1000 , so the in - plane physics is that of classical particles with a repulsive @xmath3 potential .",
    "the liquid helium does not freeze at low temperatures , so it is possible to cool the electrons on this liquid substrate well below a sharply defined 2d freezing temperature ( @xmath4 ) @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "important parameters such as the 2d shear modulus and dislocation core energy are easily calculated with this potential @xcite .",
    "computer simulations @xcite reveal a shear modulus which appears to drop to zero at the melting temperature .",
    "measurements of the shear modulus @xcite and specific heat @xcite are _ consistent _ with a continuous dislocation mediated melting transition . however , in these experiments it is difficult to determine experimentally if hexatic order and a disclination unbinding transition are in fact present above @xmath5 .",
    "however , experimental evidence for hexatic order _ has _ been found in a variety of other systems , including free standing liquid crystal films @xcite and langmuir - blodgett surfactant monolayers @xcite .",
    "a hexatic - to - liquid transition has been observed in two - dimensional magnetic bubble arrays @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is strong support for two - stage continuous melting from recent experiments on two - dimensional colloidal crystals @xcite . in this case",
    ", the colloids can be directly imaged by video - microscopy , thus allowing a precise test of the theory .",
    "the modest time scales available even on the fastest computers make equilibration in monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations of two - dimensional melting difficult . however , there is now evidence via computer simulations for continuous melting and a narrow sliver of hexatic phase for hard disks @xcite and for particles interacting with a repulsive @xmath6 potential @xcite .",
    "there are also indications of defect mediated melting transitions for the familiar lennard - jones 6 - 12 pair potential @xcite .    in the above experiments ,",
    "order was typically probed via diffraction or by direct measurement of correlation functions in real space .",
    "it is difficult to use these methods , however , when hexatic order is present on a curved surface , such as a sphere or a cylinder .",
    "examples where hexatic and crystalline order might be present on a sphere include `` liposomes '' , i.e. , closed vesicles composed of lipid bilayers @xcite , the surface of liquid metal droplets confined in paul traps @xcite , and multielectron bubbles submerged in liquid helium @xcite .",
    "hexatic order in spherical liposomes seems likely because flat two - dimensional planar layers of lipids such as dmpc ( dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine ) @xcite , similar to free standing liquid crystal films @xcite , can exist in a variety of states with different degrees of positional and orientational order .",
    "examples include fluid , smectic c , hexatic and crystalline phases .",
    "curved hexatic order may also arise on droplets .",
    "celestini et al .",
    "@xcite have found evidence from computer simulations for extended orientational correlations at the flat surface of supercooled heavy noble liquid metals , such as au , pt , or ir .",
    "these metals have a general tendency to reduce the interatomic distance at the surface . upon supercooling this effect",
    "is enhanced , leading , generally to a two - dimensional crystalline surface layer . under suitable cooling conditions ,",
    "hexatic order can also appear on the free surface of undercooled liquid metals @xcite .",
    "surface hexatic order may also occur on water droplets coated with surface - active molecules , given that there are already extensive observations of this type of order in langmuir - blodgett monolayers @xcite .",
    "finally , one might expect spherical hexatic and crystalline order in multielectron bubbles in helium .",
    "these arise when the helium surface undergoes an electrohydrodynamic instability at high electron densities .",
    "the surface then develops a regular array of dimples , each containing @xmath7 electrons or more .",
    "as the electric field increases these dimples deepen until eventually electrons break through the interface .",
    "after subduction , large numbers of electrons ( @xmath8 ) then coat the inside wall of a large ( 10 - 100@xmath9 m radius ) sphere of helium vapor .",
    "these multielectron bubbles have been observed to move through the helium after their creation above a protruding anode @xcite .",
    "they are stable at low electron densities since the coulomb pressure can be compensated by the surface tension of the helium liquid - vapor interface . however ,",
    "if the electron density becomes too high the electrostatic repulsion exceeds the balancing force and the bubble undergoes fission @xcite .",
    "one might hope that bond - orientational order in a flat membrane or interface could be detected by its effects on the dynamics of undulation modes or capillary waves .",
    "unfortunately , hexatic order couples only to the _ gaussian _ curvature @xcite , which vanishes for a simple sine wave deformation of a flat membrane or an interface ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : n11 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.38 ] ) below ) .",
    "the situation is different , however , when these excitations are superimposed on a nontrivial background geometry such as that of a sphere or a cylinder . in a recent short communication @xcite we have determined the effect of hexatic order on the undulation modes and capillary wave excitations for the spherical systems described above .",
    "the frequency shift is large for liposomes with hexatic order .",
    "observable effects could also occur for liquid metal droplets , surfactant coated water drops and in multielectron bubbles in helium . in this paper",
    "we describe hexatic dynamics on spherical surfaces in detail and extend the theory to include cylindrical geometries .",
    "_ cylindrical _ geometries could be realized by , e.g. , coating a liquid jet with a hexatic monolayer .",
    "these jets will ( similar to conventional liquids ) undergo the well - known plateau - rayleigh shape instability as soon as their length reaches a critical size .",
    "however , the stiffness associated with extended orientational correlations shifts the threshold of this instability and alters the decay of the cylinder into a chain of droplets .",
    "cylinders provide also an example where hexatic order is perfectly compatible with the underlying geometry : since the gaussian curvature of the cylinder vanishes , no disclination defects are present in the ground state to complicate the analysis .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we analyze the influence of surface hexatic order on spheres by considering liquid droplets ( sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "then , in sect .  [ sec:6 ] we apply our analysis to cylindrical geometries . here , we concentrate on liquid jets and we determine the effect of hexatic order on the plateau - rayleigh instability .",
    "next , we compute the shifted instability due to hexatic order in multielectron bubbles ( sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] ) . as a last application we investigate in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] the influence of hexatic order on the undulations of spherical vesicles . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec:7 ] we elaborate in detail on experimental consequences of our work .",
    "we first discuss liquid droplets with surface hexatic order .",
    "the equilibrium shape minimizes a droplet free energy @xmath10 given by contributions from an interfacial energy and the hexatic degrees of freedom @xmath11 where we use the summation convention throughout and @xmath12 denotes the surface tension of the interface of the liquid droplet . for a general manifold with internal coordinates @xmath13 ,",
    "the surface element is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath16 .",
    "for an undeformed sphere with radius @xmath17 , @xmath18 with polar coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is a unit vector in the tangent plane with @xmath23 which identifies ( modulo @xmath24 ) the long - range correlations in the hexatic bond directions @xcite . here , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the inverse of @xmath27 .",

    "the ratio @xmath35 jumps from an universal value @xmath36 to zero when the hexatic melts into an isotropic liquid at @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "droplets have a nearly constant volume @xmath38 and the corresponding constraint could be included in the free energy @xmath10 .",
    "however , here it is easier to first consider shape fluctuations which explicitly keep the volume fixed . finally , in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) we neglect effects arising from gravity since we only consider droplets with radii @xmath39 much smaller than the capillary length @xmath40 , which is of order millimeters or more for typical droplets in the earth s gravitational field .    in the following",
    "we will consider the dynamics of shape fluctuations of spherical droplets . as",
    "the droplet deforms its geometrical properties change , i.e. , the metric and the mean and gaussian curvature are altered .",
    "the free energy ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) thus has a functional dependence on the underlying droplet shape .",
    "this dependence can be treated most efficiently by parameterizing the surface of the droplet by its surface vector @xmath41 . for a sphere ,",
    "we have @xmath42 see appendix  [ app:1 ] for important geometrical quantities such as the metric tensor @xmath16 , the mean curvature @xmath43 and the gaussian curvature @xmath44 in terms of the surface vector @xmath45 .",
    "the fundamental assumption which underlies the hexatic free energy discussed above is that the configuration of minimal elastic energy corresponds to a vector field @xmath46 where @xmath47 can be obtained from @xmath48 by parallel transport of @xmath46 . on a sphere",
    "however , curvature introduces `` frustration '' since parallel transport of @xmath22 along closed loops on the surface leads to a rotation of @xmath22 . because of this frustration the ground state of hexatic order on a sphere has at least 12 positive disclinations .",
    "this constraint is a consequence of the poincar index theorem @xcite , which states that a vector field on a surface with genus @xmath49 and euler characteristic @xmath50 must have singularities with total vorticity @xmath51 . as a consequence , order which is identified by a vector order - parameter field on a curved geometry frustrated by a nonzero integrated gaussian curvature @xmath52 always has topological defects @xcite . on a sphere with @xmath53 and @xmath54 hexatics must have a minimum of 12 defects with charges @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the energy of an isolated disclination in a hexatic diverges logarithmically in flat space .",
    "however , this energy is reduced due to screening by the gaussian curvature of the sphere .",
    "this point can be made more precise by introducing a local bond - angle field @xmath19 , the angle between @xmath22 and some local reference frame .",
    "the transverse part of @xmath19 is then connected with the disclination density @xcite . as shown in appendix  [ app:2 ] , the elastic free energy associated with hexatic order can then be written as @xcite @xmath56   \\g(x , x ' )   \\left [ \\k(x')-s(x ' ) \\right ] .",
