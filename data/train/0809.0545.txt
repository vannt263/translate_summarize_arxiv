    "examples of quantum systems in which quantum control may play a key role include the quantum error correction problem ( see @xcite ) which is central to the development of a quantum computer and also important in the problem of developing a repeater for quantum cryptography systems , spin control in coherent magnetometry ( see @xcite ) , control of an atom trapped in a cavity ( see @xcite ) , the control of a laser optical quantum system ( see @xcite ) , control of atom lasers and bose einstein condensates ( see @xcite ) , and the feedback cooling of a nanomechanical resonator ( see @xcite ) .",
    "attention is now turning to more general aspects of quantum control , particularly in the development of systematic quantum control theories for quantum systems .",
    "for example in @xcite and @xcite it was shown that the linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) optimal control approach to controller design can be extended to linear quantum systems .",
    "also , in @xcite , it was shown that the @xmath0 optimal control approach to controller design can be extended to linear quantum systems .",
    "these theoretical results indicate that systematic optimal control methods of modern control theory have the potential of being applied to quantum systems .",
    "such modern control theory methods have the advantage that they are strongly model based and provide systematic methods of designing multivariable control systems which can achieve excellent closed loop performance and robustness .",
    "experimental demonstrations of some of these theoretical results now appear viable .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite presents the first experimental demonstration of the design and implementation of a coherent controller  from within this formalism .",
    "one particular systematic approach to control is the lqg optimal control approach to design .",
    "lqg optimal control is based on a linear dynamical model of the plant being controlled which is subject to gaussian white noise disturbances ; e.g , see @xcite . in lqg optimal control ,",
    "a dynamic linear output feedback controller is sought to minimize a quadratic cost functional which encapsulates the performance requirements of the control system .",
    "a feature of the lqg optimal control problem is that its solution involves the use of a kalman filter which provides estimates of the internal system variables .",
    "furthermore , in many applications integral action is required in order to overcome low frequency disturbances acting on the system being controlled .",
    "this issue is addressed here by using a version of lqg optimal control referred to as integral lqg control which forces the controller to include integral action ; see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the application of systematic methods of lqg optimal control to the archetypal quantum optical problem of locking the resonant frequency of an optical cavity to that of a laser .",
    "homodyne detection of the reflected port of a fabry - perot cavity is used as the measurement signal for an integral lqg controller . in our case",
    ", the linear dynamic model used is obtained using both physical considerations and experimentally measured frequency response data which is fitted to a linear dynamic model using subspace system identification methods ; e.g. , see @xcite . the integral lqg controller design is discretized and implemented on a dspace digital signal processing ( dsp ) system in the laboratory and experimental results were obtained showing that the controller has been effective in locking the optical cavity to the laser frequency .",
    "we also compare the step response obtained experimentally with the step response predicted using the identified model .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : problem ] the quantum optical model of an empty cavity is formulated in a manner consistent with the lqg design methodology ; section [ sec : sysid - cavity ] outlines the subspace system identification technique used to arrive at the linear dynamic model for the cavity system ; section [ sec : lqg ] presents the lqg optimal controller design methodology as applied to the problem of locking the frequencies of a laser and of an empty cavity together ; section [ sec : expt ] presents experimental results ; and we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "fig : hjp - laser1-fig1 ] .        the cavity can be described in the heisenberg picture by the following quantum stochastic differential equations ; e.g. , see @xcite and section 9.2.4 of @xcite : @xmath1 here , the annihilation operator for the cavity mode is denoted by @xmath2 and the annihilation operator for the coherent input mode is denoted by @xmath3 , both defined in an appropriate rotating reference frame . here",
    "@xmath4 is quantum noise .",
    "we have written @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 quantify the strength of the couplings of the respective optical fields to the cavity , including the losses .",
    "the input to the cavity is taken to be a coherent state with amplitude @xmath9 and which is assumed to be real without loss of generality .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the frequency detuning between the laser frequency and the resonant frequency of the cavity .",
    "the objective of the frequency stabilization scheme is to maintain @xmath11 .",
    "the detuning is given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the resonant frequency of the cavity , @xmath14 is the laser frequency , @xmath15 is the optical path length of the cavity , @xmath16 is the speed of light in a vacuum and @xmath17 is a large integer indicating that the @xmath18 longitudinal cavity mode is being excited .    the cavity locking problem is formally a nonlinear control problem since the equations governing the cavity dynamics in ( [ cavity-1 ] ) contain the nonlinear product term @xmath19 .",
    "in order to apply linear optimal control techniques , we linearize these equations about the zero - detuning point .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the steady state average of @xmath2 when @xmath11 such that @xmath21 .",
    "the perturbation operator @xmath22 satisfies the linear quantum stochastic differential equation ( neglecting higher order terms ) @xmath23 the perturbed output field operator @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 which implies @xmath26 .",
    "we model the measurement of the @xmath27 quadrature of @xmath24 with homodyne detection by changing the coupling operator for the laser mode to @xmath28 , and measuring the real quadrature of the resulting field .",
    "the measurement signal is then given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the intensity noise of the input coherent state .",
    "as we shall see in section [ sec : lqg ] , the lqg controller design process starts from a state - space model of the plant , actuator and measurement , traditionally expressed in the form :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 represents the vector of system variables ( we shall not use the control engineering term `` states '' to avoid confusion with quantum mechanical states ) , @xmath33 is the input to the system , @xmath34 is the measured output , and @xmath35 is a gaussian white noise disturbance acting on the system . also , @xmath36 represents the system matrix , @xmath37 is the input matrix , @xmath38 is the output matrix , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the system noise matrices .",

    "the dynamics of the detuning and actuation mechanism are sufficiently complex that direct measurement is a more experimentally reasonable approach than _ a priori _ modeling of the system . following these measurements ,",
    "an approach called subspace system identification is used to obtain the complete state - space model .",
    "it is at this point that the controller design process diverges from traditional , pre-1960s control techniques .",
    "specifically , in the traditional approach , a controller is designed using root - locus or frequency response methods , based on measurements of the plant transfer function @xcite . in our modern control approach ,",
    "the subspace identification method determines a state - space model from the input - output frequency response data and generates the system matrices @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in ( [ eqn : cavity - sys ] ) ; see  @xcite .",
    "the system matrices are used in the lqg design process as we shall see in section [ sec : lqg ] .    the transfer function of the cavity and measurement system ( or alternatively the `` plant '' ) is identified under closed - loop conditions .",
    "we use an analog proportional - integral ( pi ) controller to stabilize the system for the duration of the measurement .",
    "the frequency response data thus obtained for the plant is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : plant_sysid ] . from the data",
    ", at least three resonances can be clearly identified , occurring at frequencies of about 520 , 2100 and 5000 hz respectively .",
    "an @xmath47-order anti - aliasing filter with a corner frequency of 2.5 khz ( chosen because it is far greater than the unity - gain bandwidth of the controller and far less than the 50 khz sampling frequency ) was placed immediately prior to the digital lqg controller .",
    "this is treated mathematically as augmenting the plant such that the augmented plant has a frequency response that is the product of the plant data gathered previously and the anti - aliasing filter which is identified separately .",
    "the frequency response data obtained is then fitted to a @xmath48 order model using a subspace identification method ; see @xcite .",
    "the algorithm accommodates arbitrary frequency spacing and is known to provide good results with flexible structures .",

    "e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "however , for the purposes of this paper , a model of the form ( [ eqn : cavity - sys ] ) is most convenient . in the model ( [ eqn : cavity - sys ] ) , the term @xmath50 corresponds to the process noise and the term @xmath51 corresponds to the measurement noise .",

    "the matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 are chosen so that the cost functional reflects the desired performance objectives of the control system .",
    "the great advantage of the lqg optimal control approach to controller design is that it provides a tractable systematic way to construct output feedback controllers ( even in the case of multi - input multi - output control systems ) .",
    "also , numerical solutions exist in terms of algebraic riccati equations which can be solved using standard software packages such as matlab ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "a feature of the solution to the lqg optimal control problem is that it involves a kalman filter which provides an optimal estimate @xmath59 of the vector of system variables @xmath32 based on the measured output @xmath34 .",
    "this is combined with a `` state - feedback '' optimal control law which is obtained by minimizing the cost functional ( [ eq : lqr ] ) as if the vector of system variables @xmath32 was available to the controller .",
    "note that the lqg controller design methodology can not directly handle some important engineering issues in control system design such as robustness margins and controller bandwidth .",

    "it can be seen from ( [ cavity - quad - linear ] ) that the transfer function of the optical cavity from @xmath10 to @xmath60 is a first - order low - pass filter with a corner frequency of @xmath61 .",
    "physically , this arises from the well - known ( see for example  @xcite and the references therein ) transfer function of the optical cavity from @xmath10 to a phase shift , which is then measured by the homodyne detector . in the experimental system",
    "described herein @xmath62  hz , which is well beyond the frequency range of interest for the integral lqg controller .",
    "hence we can consider @xmath60 to be proportional to @xmath10 under these conditions , and therefore minimizing variations in @xmath10 can be regarded as being equivalent to minimizing variations in @xmath60 .",
    "the lqg performance criterion to be used for our problem is chosen to reflect the desired control system performance .",
    "that is , ( i ) to keep the cavity detuning @xmath10 small ( ideally zero ) , and ( ii ) to limit the control energy .",
    "however , these requirements are not sufficient to generate a suitable controller as the system is subject to a large initial dc offset and slowly varying disturbances .",
    "our application requires the elimination of such effects .",
