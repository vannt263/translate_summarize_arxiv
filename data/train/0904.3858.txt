    "in a recent paper belndez et al@xcite showed that the widely used small ",
    "amplitude approximation can not always be successfully applied to nonlinear oscillators . to overcome this difficulty the authors proposed the expansion of the nonlinear force in terms of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "this alternative linearization of nonlinear problems proved to be remarkably more accurate and efficient than the straightforward small  amplitude approach .",
    "besides , the chebyshev series applies even to such difficult cases where the taylor series fails@xcite .",
    "the purpose of present article is to discuss an alternative approach to nonlinear problems based on the well  known virial theorem@xcite . in sec  [ sec : oscillators ] we outline the main results of belndez et al@xcite for conservative nonlinear oscillators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vt ] we develop the virial theorem , apply it to conservative nonlinear oscillators , and compare its results with those obtained by belndez et al@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bifurcation ] we apply the virial theorem to a nonlinear problem that exhibits bifurcation and compare its results with the exact ones and with those produced by the small  amplitude approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the main results of the paper and draw conclusions .",
    "belndez et al@xcite considered nonlinear conservative autonomous systems given by the second  order differential equation @xmath0 with the boundary conditions @xmath1 , @xmath2 . here",
    "a point indicates derivative with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , belndez et al@xcite restricted themselves to odd functions @xmath4 that satisfy @xmath5 .",
    "the approach proposed by belndez et al@xcite consists in the expansion of the force in a series of chebyshev polynomials of the first kind @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "these polynomials are given by the recurrence relation @xmath9 and are orthogonal in @xmath10 with the weight function @xmath11 : @xmath12 therefore , the coefficients of the expansion ( [ eq : f_cheby ] ) are given by @xmath13 notice that there is a misprint in the weight function shown by belndez et al@xcite .",
    "if we keep only the first term in the expansion ( [ eq : f_cheby ] ) the differential equation ( [ eq : dif_eq ] ) becomes that for a harmonic oscillator @xmath14 with a frequency @xmath15 that depends on the amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "this expression proves to be remarkably accurate for many problems@xcite in spite of its simplicity .",
    "here we consider the same differential equation ( [ eq : dif_eq ] ) with the more general boundary conditions @xmath17 if we integrate the equation @xmath18 we obtain @xmath19 in particular , when @xmath20 we have @xmath21 because of the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc_gen ] ) .",
    "we now apply this general expression to the oscillators studied by belndez et al@xcite that are periodic of period @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the kinetic energy is @xmath23 and if we choose @xmath24 and @xmath25 equation ( [ eq : vt ] ) becomes the well  known virial theorem@xcite @xmath26 where the expectation values are defined as @xmath27 the virial theorem is known from long ago@xcite ; its name comes from the fact that @xmath28 is known as the virial of the forces in the mechanical system .",
    "this theorem reveals the balance between the kinetic and potential energies@xcite .",
    "the exact trajectory @xmath29 satisfies equation ( [ eq : vt_part ] ) .",
    "if we propose an approximate trajectory of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the frequency of the oscillator , then it is reasonable to set this approximate frequency so that @xmath32 satisfies the virial theorem ( [ eq : vt_part ] ) .",
    "if we substitute equation ( [ eq : x_app ] ) into equation ( [ eq : vt_part ] ) we obtain @xmath33 by means of the change of variables @xmath34 .",
    "this is exactly the equation for the frequency ( [ eq : omega_app ] ) derived by belndez et al@xcite .",
    "we appreciate that both the virial theorem and the first term of the chebyshev expansion lead to the same approximate frequency .",
    "equation ( [ eq : vt ] ) is sufficiently general for the treatment of a wide variety of interesting nonlinear problems of the form ( [ eq : dif_eq ] ) . in this section",
    "we consider the bratu equation @xmath35 that appears in simple models for the study spontaneous explosion due to internal heating in combustible materials@xcite .",
    "it is also interesting for another reason : it is a simple strongly nonlinear problem that can be exactly solved .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that it has become a useful benchmark for testing approximate methods@xcite .",
    "it is well  known that the solution to the bratu equation is@xcite @xmath36 } { \\cosh ( \\theta /2)}\\right\\ }   \\label{eq : bratu_exact}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a root of @xmath38 this equation exhibits two solutions when @xmath39 , only one when @xmath40 , and none when @xmath41 , where the critical @xmath42value @xmath43 is the maximum of @xmath44 .",
    "we easily obtain it from the root of @xmath45 that is given by @xmath46 the exact critical parameters are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    the slope at origin @xmath49 displays a bifurcation diagram as a function of @xmath42 as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bratu ] ( it is not difficult to obtain it by means of a parametric plot using equations ( [ eq : lambda(theta ) ] ) and ( [ eq : bratu_u(0)_exact ] ) ) . for the critical value of @xmath42 we have @xmath50 .    in what follows",
    "we show that the virial theorem is suitable for estimating the form of this bifurcation diagram .",
    "we simply have to introduce a trial function @xmath51 , which satisfies the appropriate boundary conditions , into the expression for the `` virial theorem '' @xmath52 notice that the exact solution satisfies @xmath53 for all @xmath54 ; therefore @xmath51 is positive and do not have zeros between the end points .",
    "this conclusion will guide us towards the choice of the trial function .",
    "one of the simplest functions that meets the criteria just indicated is @xmath55 a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath56 }   \\label{eq : bratu_lambda_var1}\\ ] ] and the slope at origin is @xmath57 , so that we can easily plot @xmath58 vs @xmath42 parametrically .",
    "[ fig : bratu ] shows that this expression is suitable fo the lower branch ( small @xmath42 ) but it is not so accurate for the upper one ( large @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , it provides a reasonable description of the bifurcation diagram and the critical parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are remarkably close to the exact ones .",
    "another simple variational function that meets the required criteria is @xmath61 that leads to @xmath62 \\right\\ } }   \\label{eq : bratu_lambda_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 stand for the modified bessel and struve functions@xcite , respectively . in this case @xmath65 and fig .",
    "[ fig : bratu ] shows that this expression is slightly less accurate than the preceding one for the lower branch and certainly more accurate for the upper one . besides , this trial function yields better critical parameters : @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the bratu equation is also suitable for revealing the limitation of the linearization by means of an expansion in a taylor series .",
    "if we neglect the nonlinear terms in the expansion : @xmath68 then we can solve the resulting differential equation exactly and obtain @xmath69 in this case the slope at origin is @xmath70 fig .  [",
    "fig : bratu ] shows that this approach based on the taylor expansion is unable to reproduce the upper branch of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "the explanation is quite simple : the solution for the lower branch is considerably smaller than the one for the upper branch .",
    "therefore , an expansion based on small values of @xmath71 will necessarily produce the former and fail on the latter . on the other hand , an expansion in appropriate orthogonal polynomials ( or the virial theorem )",
    "provides an acceptable description of both branches of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "we have shown that the approach derived by belndez et al@xcite from the first term of the expansion in chebyshev polynomials can also be obtained by means of the virial theorem .",
    "it is clear that we can introduce the approximation in two different ways : as the first term of a systematic numerical method or as the requirement posed by the virial theorem with a direct physical interpretation .",
    "one or the other point of view ( or perhaps one after the other ) may be useful for teaching an undergraduate course on classical mechanics .",
    "one can easily derive and discuss the virial theorem for mechanical problems and then generalize it for the treatment of arbitrary ordinary nonlinear differential equations .",
    "one advantage of the approach based on the virial theorem is that it is also suitable for the treatment of quantum  mechanical problems as well@xcite .",
    "the virial theorem provides us with a quite general expression that may be useful in the study of many nonlinear problems . as an example",
    "we have shown that the approach is suitable for the treatment of the well  known bratu equation that appears in simple models for heat combustion@xcite . in this case",
    "we have been able to try two different approximate solutions which may probably be more difficult if one merely resorts to an expansion in orthogonal polynomials ."
