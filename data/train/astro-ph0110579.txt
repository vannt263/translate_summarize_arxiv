    "since the first surveys with _ rosat _ , broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos have been known to have faint soft x - ray fluxes compared to their optical fluxes ( kopko , turnshek , & espey 1994 ; green & mathur 1996 ) . given the extreme absorption evident in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , this soft x - ray faintness was assumed to result from intrinsic absorption . based on this model ,",
    "the intrinsic column densities required to suppress the x - ray flux , assuming a normal qso spectral energy distribution , were found to be @xmath3  @xcite . due to the 210  kev response of its detectors ,",
    "a subsequent _ asca_survey was able to raise this lower limit for some objects by an order of magnitude , to @xmath4  @xcite . in all of these studies , the premise of a typical underlying qso spectral energy distribution and x - ray continuum",
    "was maintained . the strong correlation found by brandt , laor , & wills ( 2000",
    "; hereafter blw ) between  absorption equivalent width ( ew ) and faintness in soft x - rays further supported this assumption .",
    "observations of two bal  qsos , phl  5200@xcite and mrk  231  @xcite , provided suggestive evidence that intrisic absorption was in fact to blame for x - ray faintness . however , the limited photon statistics and bandpass precluded a definitive diagnosis .",
    "the observation of pg  2112 + 059  with _ asca _  provided the first solid evidence for intrinsic x - ray absorption and a normal underlying x - ray continuum in a bal  qso @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a few more observations of bal  qsos with _ asca _  and",
    "_ chandra_have upheld this result @xcite .",
    "observations of three mini - bal  qsos ,  , but they do not formally meet the bal  qso criteria established by @xcite . ] pg  1411 + 442  @xcite , rx  j0911.4 + 0551  @xcite , and pg  1115 + 080  @xcite , were also consistent with the absorption scenario .    in this paper",
    ", we have gathered the results from the 0.510  kev spectral analyses of all the available qsos with broad uv absorption lines , including bal  qsos , mini - bal  qsos , and one narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxy , with more than 200  counts .",
    "though additional data exist in the literature , these are the only sources with enough counts for spectral analysis on an individual basis . from our experience ,",
    "drawing strong conclusions about the nature of an x - ray spectrum based on fewer counts can lead to interpretations that are not upheld by higher quality data .",
    "our sample is listed in table  1 , along with some relevant observational parameters .",
    "the x - ray data were taken by the _ asca _  and _ chandra _  observatories , as indicated in the `` notes '' column to table1 , and figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows those spectra not previously published .",
    "the analyses for the sample objects are described in the references listed in table1 , with the exceptions of pg  1411 + 442  @xcite and phl  5200  @xcite .",
    "the spectral analyses for these two objects have been redone according to the method detailed in @xcite to ensure consistency with the other results . for phl  5200 , corrective measures for dealing with the degradation of the _ asca _  ccd detectors , as outlined in weaver , gelbord , & yaqoob ( 2000 ; appendix a ) , were followed . our derived photon index for the underlying x - ray power - law continuum pf phl  5200 , @xmath5 , was significantly flatter than that of the preferred model of @xcite .",
    "the general strategy for all of the x - ray analysis was to first try to fit the data with a simple power - law model ( including galactic absorption ) and subsequently add intrinsic absorption of three sorts : neutral , partially covering neutral , and ionized .",
    "in all cases , including intrinsic absorption provided statistically acceptable models and improved the @xmath6 of the fits significantly . for the gravitational lenses , apm  08279 + 5255 ,",
    "rx  j0911.4 + 0551 , pg  1115 + 080 , and h  1413 + 117 , the lensing galaxies could provide some of the observed absorption . however , this contribution is unlikely to be significant . at the redshifts of the known lenses ,",
    "the column density would have to be @xmath7  , much larger than the typical  through the outer regions of a galaxy , to affect strongly the best - fitting column density .",
    "in general , distinguishing between a partially covering and ionized absorber is not possible statistically ; with ccd resolution and the current statistics , the two models can fit the data equally well .",
    "typically , the ionized - absorber models produce column densities within a factor of 0.52.0 of the partial - covering models . however , though an ionized absorber was included for completeness in fitting each of the spectra , the ionized - absorber models , such as in the spectral fitting package @xcite , assume a single - zone , optically thin plasma .",
    "such assumptions are not in general appropriate for the large x - ray column densitities , @xmath7 , exhibited by qsos with broad uv absorption ( h.  netzer , 2001 , priv .",
    "comm . ) . therefore ,",
    "when a complex absorber model provided a statistically significant improvement over a simple neutral absorber , the partial - covering model was chosen .",
    "the column densities and covering fractions for the best - fitting absorption models , as well as the best - fitting photon indices , are listed in table1 .",
    "as obtaining even moderate - quality spectra of these faint x - ray sources requires a significant amount of observing time with the current generation of x - ray observatories , a comprehensive and intricate x - ray picture of the population of qsos with broad uv absorption lines awaits the accumulation of a significantly larger body of data .",
    "however , as the number of these qsos observed in x - rays grows , a consistent basic picture is beginning to emerge .",
    "most fundamentally , the days of assuming , without evidence , that qsos with broad uv absorption lines have the underlying x - ray continua of normal qsos are over .",
    "the spectroscopic measurement of the photon index , @xmath8 , of the power - law continuum for each of these objects versus redshift is shown in figure[fig : plots]a . excluding the apparent outlier h  1413 + 117 , the mean photon index for our sample is @xmath9 , entirely consistent with the range of @xmath8 measured for large samples of low and high luminosity radio - quiet qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . furthermore , there is no evidence for strong systematic changes in spectral slope as a function of redshift .",
    "in fact , the well - measured continuum slope of apm  08279 + 5255(@xmath10 ) extends constraints on radio - quiet qso x - ray continuum shape evolution to significantly higher redshift , @xmath11 , than previously possible .    for evaluating the spectral energy distribution of a qso , the quantity @xmath12  measures the relative flux densities at 2  kev and 3000   .",
    "radio - quiet qsos without intrinsic absorption have @xmath12@xmath13 ( blw ) , while absorbed qsos tend to have @xmath12@xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath12  values for this sample are found to be generally indicative of absorption ( see table  1 and figure  [ fig : plots]b ) , though the measured x - ray column - density is not obviously correlated with @xmath12 .",
    "though our values for the 3000    flux density were not corrected for possible intrinsic reddening , this is not expected to be a significant problem for these blue qsos .",
    "furthermore , though variability between the optical and x - ray observations could result in an inaccurate @xmath12 , this quantity is only sensitive to large changes in flux density ; e.g. , a factor of two increase in the 3000  flux density only corresponds to @xmath15@xmath12@xmath16 .",
    "correcting the x - ray spectra for the fitted intrinsic absorption brings these objects within the range of typical @xmath12 , indicating that the underlying spectral energy distributions are not anomalous ( see figure  [ fig : plots]b ) . both of the assumptions of the early bal  qso x - ray work , normal x - ray continuum and typical @xmath12 ,",
    "are thus supported .      a simple neutral absorber blocks almost all x - ray flux up to an energy set by the column density ; for @xmath17 , x - rays up to in the rest frame are absorbed .",
    "a signature of more complex absorption , for example partial covering and/or ionized gas along the line of sight , is a much less abrupt decline of the flux at the lowest energies ( see for an example ) . for five of the eight sources , a partial - covering absorber provided a statistically significant improvement over a neutral absorber , and the column densities listed are for that model .    for the remaining three qsos , apm  08279 + 5255 , h  1413 + 117 , and pg  2112 + 059",
    ", the current data do not permit the nature of the absorber to be examined in detail . for h  1413 + 117  and pg  2112 + 059 ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the x - ray data below is insufficient for studying the structure of the absorption , and for apm  08279 + 5255 , the large redshift ( @xmath11 ) pushes the signatures of a complex absorber below the _ chandra _  acis bandpass ( ) .",
    "the famous gravitationally lensed `` cloverleaf '' qso , h  1413 + 117 , does not fit within the basic picture outlined above for the other absorbed qsos in this sample .",
    "though significant intrinsic absorption is measured , the best - fitting photon index is unusually flat for a radio - quiet qso , @xmath18 . furthermore , even after correcting for intrinsic absorption , @xmath12  remains low at @xmath19 . finally , including a narrow",
    ", 6.4  kev  emission line in the model improves the fit at the @xmath20 confidence level according to the @xmath21-test ( @xmath22 for one additional fitting parameter ; ) . in the rest frame",
    ", this strong line has an equivalent width of @xmath23  ev . the flat rest - frame",
    "1.818  kev slope and strong  emission line together suggest that the spectrum is reflection - dominated , and thus the direct x - rays are completely obscured . in terms of absorption - line profiles ,",
    "h  1413 + 117  is similar to phl  5200 , with smooth profiles starting at near - zero velocities @xcite , and both qsos also exhibit high continuum polarization @xcite .",
    "however , the x - ray properties of these two qsos are quite different as phl  5200  shows no evidence for reflection .",
    "the difference between h  1413 + 117  and the other bal  qsos may lie in its uv spectrum ; @xcite found broad  absorption , which has never been found without  absorption , the signature of a low - ionization bal  qso ( lobal  qso ; n. arav and m. brotherton 2001 , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "those bal  qsos with broad absorption in  have notably lower @xmath12  values than bal  qsos with only high - ionization absorption lines @xcite .",
    "this could plausibly result from either an intrinsically x - ray weak continuum , or from heavy , perhaps compton - thick , obscuration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case",
    ", only indirect x - rays from the active nucleus , either scattered around the obscuration by a small - scale electron mirror or reflected off of more distant , neutral material , can reach the observer , and the intrinsic x - ray power of the nucleus can not be directly measured .",
    "given the extreme x - ray faintness of this class of objects , very few spectra are likely to be obtained .",
    "the two examples available at present are mrk  231 @xcite and h  1413 + 117 .",
    "for these two objects , two pieces of evidence indicate that the direct x - ray continuum is not being observed : the spectral shape is unusually flat ( @xmath24 ) , and the value of @xmath12  is still low after correcting for all the direct signs of absorption .",
    "in every case where the analysis is sensitive to structure in the x - ray absorption , we find evidence for complexity . while we model this complexity as intrinsic , neutral absorption partially covering the x - ray continuum source , the actual nature of this absorbing gas could be much more complicated .",
    "x - ray scattering in the nucleus effectively causes partial - covering absorption , and if the x - ray absorbing gas is physically related to that absorbing the uv continuum , then it should also be ionized . determining the ionization state of the x - ray absorbing gas and the continuum scattering fraction is essential for accurately measuring the column density .",
    "furthermore , the current modeling assumes no velocity dispersion in the absorbing gas . in such gas ,",
    "the opacity in the soft x - rays arises primarily from bound - free metal edges , and these are used to determine the absorption column density . with a significant velocity dispersion ,",
    "the opacity of bound - bound absorption lines can increase significantly .",
    "therefore , the assumption of zero velocity dispersion , clearly nave for bal  qsos , may result in an overestimate of the amount of x - ray absorbing gas .",
    "the significant correlation found by blw of absorption ew versus weakness in soft x - rays holds across several orders of magnitude of absorption ew .",
    "the inference that the weakness in soft x - rays is the result of intrinsic absorption has been substantiated spectroscopically for all but one of the objects in our sample ( h  1413 + 117 , see @xmath25[sec : clover ] ) . however , directly identifying the ew of the uv absorption with the column density of the x - ray absorbing gas is problematic ( see ) .",
    "blw speculated that at the absorbed end of their correlation , the ew of  is dominated primarily by velocity dispersion rather than column density . in this case ,",
    "bal  qsos , by definition @xcite , would be expected to have the most extreme  ew properties , as they do . as seen in though",
    ", bal  qsos may not necessarily always have the largest x - ray absorption column densities .    in terms of gross x - ray properties ,",
    "it has become apparent that drawing a distinction between bal qsos and other qsos with broad uv absorption lines is largely a matter of semantics .",
    "the photon indices and the column densities measured with the current x - ray observatories overlap .",
    "future , higher spectral resolution x - ray observations may reveal features warranting separate classifications , but at present the differences do not justify treating the bal and mini - bal qso populations , for example , as distinct .",
    "though x - ray spectroscopy of qsos with broad uv absorption lines is finally addressing some of the questions first raised by _",
    "rosat_observations , many issues remain unresolved .",
    "primarily , the velocity structure and ionization state of the x - ray absorbing gas are unknown . without this crucial information ,",
    "the mass ejection rate of gas from the nuclei of these qsos can not be determined .",
    "this parameter is fundamental for understanding the balance of accretion and outflow in the central engine . to address these important questions ,",
    "x - ray spectroscopy at gratings resolution of the x - ray brightest qsos with broad uv absorption is the next step .",
    "investigating the physical basis for the extreme x - ray faintness of lobal  qsos may need to await the next generation of x - ray observatories .",
