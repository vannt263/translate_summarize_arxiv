    "we would like to address the question of the most general knot invariant coming from bf topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) . in the mid-90 s , cattaneo et al .",
    "@xcite showed that while bf theory with cosmological constant produces the same invariants of knots as the chern - simons ( cs ) theory , the bf theory with no cosmological constant ( pure bf theory ) and su(2 ) gauge group produces invariants that lie in the algebra generated by the coefficients of the alexander - conway polynomial .",
    "the bf tqft is completely equivalent to cs theory , however while the equivalence with non - zero cosmological constant maintains the semi - simplicity property of the gauge group , the equivalence when the cosmological constant is set to zero shifts us to a cs theory with a non - semi - simple gauge group .",
    "thus , starting with a gauge group g in the pure bf theory we end up on the cs side with a semi - direct product of the group with its lie algebra @xmath1 , also known as the inhomogeneous group of g ( denoted ig ) . eventually , the question we want to address is as follows :    _ what is the most general knot invariant ( or knot observable ) in a cs theory with an inhomogeneous gauge group ? _    the natural thing to begin with is the standard gauge invariant observable : the trace of the holonomy of the gauge connection along the knot , in some chosen representation .",
    "as we shall see in chapter 2 , this observable gives us no information regarding the knot ( except for framing information that can be normalized to zero anyway ) .",
    "this fact seems to pose a contradiction since in the equivalent pure bf theory one can extract some non - trivial information regarding the knot ( at least in the case of su(2 ) gauge ) . therefore , there must be a procedure that will give us non - trivial information regarding the knot in this setting .",
    "+ in this paper we will introduce the following procedure ( section 3.1 ) : we take an observable which is not gauge invariant at one single point on the knot ( holonomy along the knot without the trace ) . by doing that",
    ", we get a cs theory on @xmath2 with broken gauge symmetry at one point on the knot .",
    "then , we declare this point to be infinity by taking the point out of our space ( i.e. puncturing @xmath2 at that point ) .",
    "since the gauge transformations are taken to vanish at infinity , we get a completely invariant cs theory on @xmath0 with a long knot embedded in it .",
    "since knot theory in @xmath2 and long knot theory in @xmath0 are `` isomorphic '' theories we lose no information as far as knot theory is concerned and we get `` legal '' cs theory in which we can consider a new and wider class of observables . + using perturbation theory , we will show that our observable gives non - trivial information about the knot ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "continuing with perturbation theory in our setting ( cs with ig gauge group and the new observable ) we will be able to prove that the most general knot invariant coming from such a construction is in the algebra generated by the coefficients of the alexander - conway polynomial ( section 3.3 ) . returning to bf theory ( chapter 4 ) we will create an observable that reproduces cattaneo et al.s result for su(2 ) and generalizes it to every metrizable gauge group and representation thereof used in the construction of the pure bf theory .",
    "+ our construction detects , in some sense , the difference between the invariant subspace of the universal enveloping algebra of the non - semi - simple gauge group and the co - invariant quotient of the universal enveloping algebra .",
    "this enables us to extract non - trivial information regarding the knot ( a difference which does not exist in the semi - simple case ) .",
    "we discuss this issue in chapter 5 .",
    "in this section we will show that the perturbation theory of chern - simons ( cs ) theory with an inhomogeneous gauge group and the standard knot observable is almost trivial .",
    "we start ( 2.1 ) with some reminders about perturbation theory ( in cs context ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to the size of the topic this reminder is not meant to teach the theory . for recent detailed pedagogic reviews",
    "see  @xcite",
    ". this will be followed by introduction of the inhomogeneous gauge group and our notations for it ( 2.2 ) .",
    "we continue with giving more details about perturbation theory using this gauge group ( 2.3 ) .",
    "section 2.3 will describe the consequences of using such a gauge group on the knot invariants coming from the standard observable .",
    "finally , in section 2.4 , we will show that the standard construction in this setting is trivial , leading to ( almost ) trivial knot invariants .",
    "we recall the setting for knot invariants in the framework of cs theory ( in this chapter a knot is an embedding of @xmath3 into @xmath2 ) .",
    "we take @xmath2 to be the 3 dimensional manifold on which the cs theory is defined .",
    "we choose any gauge group g whose lie algebra is metrizable ( e.g. semi - simple gauge group ) .",
    "denote the metric on the lie algebra by @xmath4 and let a be a g - connection .",
    "we consider the following action functional : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a coupling constant which satisfies a quantization condition ( e.g. for semi - simple gauge groups it must be an integer ) . in",
    "what follows , however , we will work perturbatively with formal power series in @xmath7 . + now , recall the standard knot observable - @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for the holonomy of the connection a along the knot ( the path - ordered exponent of the integral of a along the knot ) and the trace is taken in some chosen representation @xmath10 of the gauge group . +",
    "one obtains a knot invariant by taking the path integral over all connections with the observable plugged into the integrand : @xmath11 this integral is usually referred to as the expectation value of the standard observable and it is viewed as a function from knots to the base field ( the complex numbers from now on ) .",
    "one is usually interested in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the path integral with no observable plugged in ( no knot ) .",
    "+ calculating the integral using perturbation theory we get the following sum : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is defined to be the set of all trivalent connected graphs based on @xmath3 ( feynman diagrams based on a wilson loop ) , @xmath16 is the integration of the corresponding propagators over the diagram ( that is , the integration over the appropriate configuration space ) and @xmath17 is the lie - algebraic part of the expectation value which holds all the information coming from the lie group g and its representation @xmath10 ( that is , the weight system , reviewed quickly below ) . + in the cs perturbation theory calculation , every internal edge contributes @xmath18 and every internal vertex contributes @xmath6 to the total power of @xmath6 of the diagram ( recall that an internal edge / vertex is an edge / vertex which is not on the wilson loop ) .",
    "the total power of @xmath18 is called the _ degree _ of the diagram .",
    "a convenient way of counting the degree is labeling each internal vertex with -1 and each edge with + 1 and then summing all the labels to get the degree of the diagram .",
    "this number is denoted @xmath19 .",
    "+ we want to factorize the perturbation theory calculation in order to get a better hold on the above knot invariant . as a first step , we can drop the weight system and replace it with the diagram d on which it is calculated .",
    "we get the following invariant : @xmath20 this invariant is viewed as taking values in @xmath21 , where we define @xmath21 as follows :    @xmath21 is the algebra of all connected trivalent graphs based on a circle ( i.e. @xmath15 ) quotient by the ihx relation @xmath22{ihx.eps}}\\end{array}\\hspace{-3pt}}}$ ] , the stu relation @xmath23{stu.eps}}\\end{array}\\hspace{-3pt}}}$ ] and the anti - symmetry relation @xmath24{as.eps}}\\end{array}\\hspace{-3pt}}}$ ] .",
    "when we apply the weight system @xmath17 to this invariant we get the first sum .",
    "next we will apply the weight system by parts , in order to get a further factorization .",
    "+ weight systems are described and explored in @xcite .",
    "we recall the main construction of a weight system coming from a lie algebra , which includes three parts : labeling , contracting and the trace part .",
    "in the labeling part , after choosing a basis for the lie algebra , one labels each internal edge of a given diagram ( i.e. edges that are not contained in the base circle ) with a different index on each end of the edge . in the second part , one writes the structure constants tensor for each internal vertex and the metric tensor for each internal edge ( using the indices on these vertices / edges and the chosen basis ) and proceeds to contract matching indices ( using the metric to raise and lower indices ) . at that point ,",
    "one is left with an invariant tensor in the enveloping algebra of @xmath25 whose indices are the ones on the vertices on the base loop . in the final part , the trace part",
    ", one represents this tensor using a chosen representation of @xmath25 and takes the trace .",
    "this concludes the construction of the weight system .",
    "+ taking a diagram ( more precisely a class representative but we will not make these distinctions throughout the paper ) in @xmath21 and applying to it the labeling and contracting parts of the weight system gives us a tensor in the universal enveloping algebra .",
    "this tensor is invariant under the adjoint action ( all the tensors used in building it are invariant under the action and contractions are @xmath25-maps ) and therefore it is in the invariant subspace of the universal enveloping algebra @xmath26 .",
    "although we did not apply the trace part of the weight system yet , we still have a trace of the trace that appears in the standard observable we started with , which comes about diagrammatically in the fact that we are looking at diagrams based on @xmath3 .",
    "the ability to move legs around cyclically ( which is the trace property ) forces us to quotient the resulting tensor in @xmath26 into the co - invariant quotient of the algebra , thus getting an invariant in @xmath27 .",
    "finally , one can apply the trace part to get elements of @xmath28 .",
    "to summarize , when we use perturbation theory for the standard observable , we get a knot invariant in the form of a series ( in @xmath18 ) with coefficients in @xmath28 , which factorize in the following way :    @xmath29 \\rightarrow ( u(\\mathcal{g})^\\mathcal{g})_\\mathcal{g}[[k^{-1 } ] ] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{c}[[k^{-1}]]\\ ] ]    although there is much more to say about chern - simons theory and the use of perturbation theory in this context , we will stop at this point .",
    "we recommend @xcite for various approaches ( physically and/or mathematically inclined ) in addition to the reviews cited above .",
    "the fact that we actually get a knot invariant in every step of the factorization above is an example of an important issue which we completely ignored here .",
    "+      we now present a specific type of gauge group that we wish to focus on in the context of perturbation theory of cs theory . +",
    "start with a semi - simple gauge group g and take a semi - direct product of it with its lie algebra ( the semi - direct action is the adjoint action ) .",
    "look at the lie algebra of this semi - direct product and denote it @xmath30 . as a vector space",
    ", @xmath30 is a double copy of the original algebra , @xmath31 , where we use upper bar notation to distinguish the second copy . for any @xmath32 let @xmath33 be the identity map between the two copies .",
    "thus @xmath34 is the element @xmath35 in the second copy of @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath36 be a basis for @xmath25 , @xmath37 the corresponding basis for @xmath38 and [ . , . ]",
    "the original bracket structure on @xmath25 .",
    "we have the following bracket structure on @xmath30 : @xmath39_{l_0 } = [ x_i , x_j ] \\hspace{6 mm } [ x_i,\\overline{x_j}]_{l_0 } = \\overline{[x_i , x_j ] } \\hspace{6 mm } [ \\overline{x_i},\\overline{x_j}]_{l_0}=0\\ ] ] we see now that the second copy is the abelianization of the original algebra . + letting the metric on @xmath25 be @xmath4 ( the one coming from the trace of the adjoint representation , say ) we take the following ( invariant ) metric on @xmath30 : @xmath40 +      let us look at the perturbation theory expansion using the inhomogeneous gauge group @xmath30 .",
    "as we will show , the factorization ( 1 ) factors even further as the weight system using this type of lie algebra is more refined .",
    "we will define the space of directed `` legal '' diagrams and construct a factorization of the weight system @xmath41 through a map into it .",
    "+ as known from standard perturbation theory of quantum gauge theories , the algebraic contributions of vertices and edges in a feynman diagram are determined by the structure constants and the metric on the lie algebra .",
    "these contributions are encoded in the weight system , as described earlier .",
    "given a diagram , choose a basis @xmath36 to @xmath25 , take the corresponding basis @xmath37 to @xmath38 ( obtaining a basis to the entire algebra ) and apply the weight system using the following steps : + 1(pre ) .",
    "sum over all the ways of labeling the ends of the edges of the diagram with different indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 representing the basis for @xmath25 and @xmath38 respectively . therefore , instead of labeling with one type of indices running over the entire basis of the algebra , label with two types of indices , each running over one summand in the direct sum that forms the algebra .",
    "+ 2(pre ) .",
    "write the structure constants tensor and the metric tensor ( as before ) with indices according to the labeling , and contract the matching indices ( thus in each summand of step 1(pre ) only a part of the algebra basis is contracted ) .",
    "+ since the summations are finite , one can see that this way of applying the labeling and contraction parts of the weight system ( i.e. in two summation steps having two types of algebra indices instead of one ) is equivalent to the usual way of applying the weight system .",
    "+ furthermore , we know that certain combinations of indices vanish in the second step . by looking at the metric we observe that the only edges which are non zero are the ones that have a non - bar index on one end and a bar - index at the other end . by looking at the bracket structure",
    "we observe that the only combination of indices on a vertex that will not be zero at step 2(pre ) is a combination of two non - bar indices and one bar index .",
    "this allows us to revise step 1(pre ) above into : + 1(revised ) .",
    "sum over all ways of labeling the ends of the edges of the diagram with indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 , representing the basis for @xmath25 and @xmath38 respectively , in such a way that each edge has one bar index and one non - bar index at its ends , and each vertex has two non - bar indices and one bar index at its legs .",
    "+ let us introduce a notation . wherever we have an edge after step 1(revised )",
    "we direct the edge ( by putting an arrow head ) from the non - bar index to the bar index and drop the bar on top of the bar index .",
    "thus the two steps for applying the weight system of @xmath30 on a diagram can be finalized into the following form : + 1 .",
    "sum over all ways of directing the edges of the diagram ( internal edges only ) in such a way that each vertex has two outgoing legs and one ingoing leg ( we call it a `` legal '' directing and it looks like @xmath44{as1.eps}}\\end{array}\\hspace{-3pt}}}$ ] ) .",
    "put a different index on each end of all the directed edges , write down the appropriate tensors and contract indices according to the arrow convention above ( i.e. the arrow s direction indicates if the index is considered bar or non - bar , and we use the appropriate basis accordingly ) .",

    "the best we can do is try and avoid the reasons lemma 2.5 is true .",
    "when we look at the proof of lemma 2.5 we can realize that the cause for the vanishing contribution of the wheel diagrams is the fact that legs can be moved around the wilson loop ( the base circle of the diagram ) .",
    "dealing with the loop translates ( observable - wise ) to dealing with the trace ( and its cyclic properties ) in the standard observable . in diagrammatic terms ( perturbation - wise ) this means trying to cut the base circle open .",
    "+ assume first that we just remove the trace from the standard observable of a knot in @xmath2 .",
    "we get an expectation value which is formally a tensor in the universal enveloping algebra @xmath67 .",
    "this expression , though , is not well defined since the holonomy by itself is not well defined and transforms non - trivially by conjugation under gauge transformation @xmath68 . choosing ( in advance )",
    "one point on the knot , say @xmath69 , the conjugation is done by the gauge element at that point ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the remedy for that would be to view this ( not well defined ) invariant in the co - invariant quotient @xmath71 .",
    "the way this is done ( observable - wise ) is of course by bringing back the trace .",
    "we have done nothing then . +",
    "this leads us to try and have special considerations for @xmath69 ( the chosen point on the knot ) and the gauge symmetry at that point .",
    "let us break the gauge symmetry at @xmath69 .",
    "there are a few equivalent ways of looking at that process .",
    "the first is by declaring that the gauge transformation at @xmath69 is always the identity element .",
    "this might seem to be a bit artificial but an equivalent way of doing it is taking @xmath69 out of the space on which the theory is defined by puncturing @xmath2 on @xmath69 . in other words , `` send '' @xmath69 to infinity where gauge transformations are taken to vanish .",
    "this shifts us to a theory on a long knot ( embedding of @xmath72 ) in @xmath0 with an invariant @xmath73 which is well defined in the framework of cs theory .",
    "+ _ to summarize , we move from a cs theory on @xmath2 and a knot ( embedding of @xmath3 ) in it to a cs theory on @xmath0 and a long knot ( embedding of @xmath72 ) in it .",
    "this is done by choosing a special point on the knot , puncturing the space there and declaring the puncture as infinity .",
    "the standard observable @xmath74 is replaced by a more general observable @xmath75 . _",
    "+ as far as knots are concerned , `` regular '' knots and long knots are equivalent and we do not lose any information regarding the knot in the process above .",
    "moreover , @xmath75 ( and functions of it ) is actually the most general observable in this framework since the connection can always be recovered ( up to gauge transformations ) from the holonomy information",
    ". thus we work in the setting which allows us to extract maximum information regarding the knot when using the inhomogeneous gauge group .",
    "+ we take now @xmath76 and apply the same perturbation theory factorization as in chapter 2 .",
    "there are several differences to note : + first , we work with a long knot .",
    "thus , all the feynman diagrams are not based on a loop but on an interval ( representing the embedding of our long knot @xmath72 ) .",
    "the other properties of the diagrams do not change , though .",
    "we define :    @xmath77 is the algebra of all connected trivalent graphs based on an interval , modulo the stu , ihx and as relations .",
    "( i.e. @xmath21 with the circle replaced by an interval ) .",
    "+ @xmath78 is defined the same way as @xmath49 , except that the diagrams are based on an interval and not on a circle .",
    "second , the knot invariant factors through the invariant subspace of the universal enveloping algebra @xmath79 .",
    "this time there is no necessity in taking the co - invariant quotient of that space , a necessity that came about because of the base circle ( or the trace in the observable ) .",
    "note that the fact that we indeed get a tensor in the invariant subspace tells us that the construction was independent of the choice of the special point @xmath69 . +",
    "third , we do not have a map to @xmath28 yet .",
    "+ all together we get the following factorization for the perturbation theory of cs theory on @xmath0 with a long knot in it ( we denote by @xmath80 the last map ) :    @xmath81 \\rightarrow \\overrightarrow{\\mathcal{a}(i)}[[k^{-1 } ] ] \\xrightarrow{l }    u(l_0)^{l_0}[[k^{-1}]]\\ ] ]     +      we have not shown so far that the algebra @xmath78 is non - zero and that our construction is indeed non - trivial in the sense that it fixes the problems encountered with the standard observable .",
    "we have also not defined a scalar observable , i.e. a map @xmath82 which completes the perturbation theory factorization .",
    "we will now achieve both goals by finding an explicit functional from @xmath78 to @xmath28 that does not vanish when composed with the above factorization .",
    "we will give a formula for a scalar function @xmath83 that is not zero on the part of @xmath79 which comes from wheel diagrams in @xmath78 .",
    "this observable can not possibly be any trace of @xmath75 in some representation , since that will bring us back to the case of chapter 2 . thus we need to find some other scalar function of @xmath75 .",
    "+ start with an n - dimensional representation of @xmath25 and denote it @xmath84 . define the following representation @xmath10 of @xmath30 : @xmath85 it is straight forward to verify that the commutation relation for r is indeed compatible with the commutation relations of the semi - direct product and that @xmath10 is indeed a representation of @xmath30 .",

    "all the external legs ( the ones that touch the base interval ) point towards the interval , as we have already seen .",
    "this means that after applying @xmath80 , the tensor @xmath108 that we get in @xmath86 will have all its components in @xmath38 . after applying @xmath88 to @xmath108 we get a tensor in @xmath109 such that each of its summands actually looks like @xmath110 .",
    "+ now , the only type of tensors @xmath111 that will possibly not result in zero after applying @xmath112 to it , is the type in which each component @xmath113 is actually an element of @xmath38 ( i.e. tensors of length one in @xmath86 with entry from @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is immediate from the definition of @xmath10 ( 4 ) on @xmath114 , the definition of @xmath94 and the definition of @xmath97 .",
    "+ we summarize then  given a wheel diagram we apply @xmath80 to it and get a tensor @xmath108 in @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath115 is a tensor in @xmath109 but the only non zero contributions to @xmath116 come from the summands of @xmath115 that look like @xmath108 or any permutations of its entries :    @xmath117    @xmath118    where we made a distinction between the tensor product @xmath119 of @xmath86 and the product @xmath120 of @xmath109 for the sake of clarity .",
    "+ the calculation of @xmath121 is almost the same as the calculation of the weight system @xmath122 on the non directed @xmath123-wheel diagram ( i.e. the directed @xmath123-wheel with its arrows forgotten ) .",

    "we can now build an actual quantum observable ( function of @xmath75 ) to plug in the path integral such that the map @xmath131 will be the last part of the factorization ( @xmath83 ) in its perturbation theory calculation of the expectation value .",
