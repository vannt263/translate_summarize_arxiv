    "<S> we find broken detailed balance in the form of nonzero probability currents , which exhibit rotations in phase space with characteristic frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> conceptually , the breakdown of detailed balance in mode space is found to arise from a nonuniform distribution of the active forces acting on the filaments , where sites that experience higher motor activity dissipate mechanical energy along the probe filament . </S>",

    "<S> we assume that both thermal forces and motor forces propagated through the network induce small transverse fluctuations of the probe filament . to capture these fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , we parameterize the shape of the weakly undulating filament at time @xmath2 by the transverse deflection @xmath3 along its arc length @xmath4 . such transverse deflections result in a restoring force per unit length @xmath5 , assuming the filament can be described as an inextensible worm - like chain  @xcite with a bending rigidity @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> the currents ( white arrows ) exhibit a clockwise circulation in this plane of mode space . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the breaking of detailed balance in this mode space does not arise from energy exchange between bending modes , but rather from how stochastic motor forces induce mode correlations . in the absence of motor forces , these modes evolve independently , such that the system can be described by a series of uncoupled 1d systems . perhaps counter - intuitively , we expect the coupling and resulting currents to vanish in the limit of high motor density ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : correlationcoefficients ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it has also been argued that heavy - tailed histograms of particle displacements in active networks approach gaussian distributions in the high motor density limit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , high densities of motors can lead to behaviour resembling thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> in general however , neither gaussian displacement distributions nor detailed balance in the mode dynamics are sufficient conditions for equilibrium  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is illuminating to study different projections of the probability currents to characterise the nonequilibrium dynamics . </S>",

    "<S> we focus on the origin of the probability current , the active force term @xmath99 . from the active mode </S>",
    "<S> correlators ( eq .  ) we obtain the mode - correlation matrix @xmath100 for @xmath101 , which we use to solve the fokker - planck equation with white - noise . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a closed - form of the probability flux @xmath102 , where @xmath103 . under steady - state conditions </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath86 is purely rotational because @xmath104 , implying purely imaginary eigenvalues of @xmath105 , which constitute the cycling frequencies associated with the circular probability currents  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to consider the cycling frequency @xmath98 of a two - dimensional system @xmath106 ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the leading - order term of a power expansion of @xmath98 in @xmath107 reveals dependencies of the current on relaxation times and coupling coefficients @xmath108 the sign of this frequency indicates the direction of the current circulation in mode space ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eqandnoneqmodedynamics ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this underlines that detailed balance in a space of normal mode amplitudes of the filament is broken if and only if motor activity drives several modes with different relaxation times at once such that @xmath109 . motor activity impacts the filament on the scale @xmath9 , inducing a coupling between the bending modes of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> this result does not hinge on the motor timescale @xmath110 and applies even when the driving forces acting at the discrete points are described by white noise . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , thermal forces impact the filament homogeneously , and thus do not introduce coupling between different bending modes . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , if we consider an ensemble of filaments dispersed throughout a random network , each filament will sample a different local interaction profile @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect that nonequilibrium mode coupling will vanish when averaging over an ensemble of filaments , restoring detailed balance , even in an active system .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlations and currents predicted by our model could , in principle , be tested experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> it is not a priori obvious which projections of mode space will reveal the largest currents , but highly correlated mode pairs constitute likely candidates . probing detailed balance in fluctuations of probe filaments and measuring cycling frequencies will be an ideal , non - invasive tool to detect and quantify motor activity in biological networks , living cells , and tissues  @xcite .    </S>",
