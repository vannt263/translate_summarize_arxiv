    "the unification idea , mainly in @xmath0  @xcite , is still an interesting alternative for the physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the minimal non - supersymmetric @xmath0 model has been ruled out by experimental data : i ) the proton is more stable than the prediction of the minimal model  @xcite ; ii ) the value of weak mixing angle at the @xmath6-peak @xmath7 [ or alternatively @xmath8 does not agree with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "it means that the three coupling constants do not meet at a single point if only the standard model particles are taken into account ; iii ) the electron and @xmath9-like quark masses are equal at the unification scale , and iv ) last but not least , neutrinos are massless in the model .",
    "moreover , the supersymmetric version , i.e. , susy @xmath0 , although it allows an unification of the coupling constants , it has serious problems with the proton decay  @xcite ( however see @xcite ) and probably also with the electroweak data  @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears natural to ask ourselves if there are other options besides susy @xmath0 that yield convergence of the couplings , the observed value of the weak mixing angle and the other parameters at the @xmath6-pole , an appropriately stable proton and , at the same time , realistic fermions masses including neutrino masses .",
    "another problem , not necessarily related to the previous one , concerns the existence of axions  @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in theories involving such particles has raised also due experiments devoted to the search of axion - like particles  @xcite .",
    "if the axion does exist it is important to know the realistic model in which the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry can be automatically implemented and how the axion parameters can be stabilized against possible semi - classical gravitational effects  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the context of the multi - higgs extension of the standard model with an invisible axion proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite we have : _ i ) _ the unification of the three gauge coupling constants near the pq scale ; _ ii ) _ the model predicts the correct value of the weak mixing angle at the @xmath6-peak ; _ iii ) _ the axion and the nucleon are stabilized by the cyclic @xmath10 discrete symmetries ; finally , _",
    "iv ) _ although neutrinos got an arbitrary dirac mass , through the effective @xmath11 operators @xmath12 , the left - handed neutrinos get also a majorana mass @xmath13 ev and the right - handed neutrinos acquire a large majorana mass term via @xmath14 effective operator @xmath15 , implementing in this way a see - saw mechanism at the pq energy scale .    here",
    "we will consider an @xmath0 grand unified theory which unify the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , in such a way that the partner of the standard model fields in @xmath0 multiplets are new heavy fields .",
    "this model allows an stable proton , unification of the three coupling constants , a natural pq symmetry of the classical lagrangian , and the axion being protected against semi - classical gravity effects .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : su5 ] we give the representation content of the model and the @xmath5 and pq charge assignments of the several multiplets .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] , we consider the running equations for the three gauge coupling constants related to the low energy @xmath16 symmetry group . in sec  [ sec : proton ] we consider the proton stabilization and other phenomenological consequences concerning the model ; finally the last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "in ref .  @xcite the representation content of the standard model was augmented by adding scalar fields and three right - handed neutrinos , in such a way that a discrete @xmath17 symmetry was implemented in the model there .",
    "explicitly , the particle content of the model is the following : @xmath18 , @xmath19 denote quark and lepton doublets , respectively ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the right - handed components .",
    "it was also assumed that each charged sector gain mass from a different scalar doublet : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 which generate dirac masses for @xmath28-like , @xmath9-like quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos , respectively ( all of them of the form @xmath29 ) .",
    "some other scalar fields were also considered in order to permit the full symmetry realization : a neutral complex singlet @xmath30 , a singly charged singlet @xmath31 and a triplet @xmath32 .",
    "next , we wonder what is the simplest group embedding the above representation content .",
    "the answer is : @xmath0 . to achieve this , along with a @xmath5 symmetry",
    ", we have to add new fermions and scalar fields .    in this vein ,",
    "the representation content of our @xmath0 model is as follows . for each family , the fermion representation content under @xmath33 , there are two @xmath34 : @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and two @xmath37 : @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are heavy charged and neutral leptons , respectively , and @xmath42 are heavy quarks having the same electric charge of the respective quarks @xmath43 . finally , in the fermion sector we have to add fermionic neutral singlets @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we have used a notation in which the subindex @xmath46 denotes the multiplet to which the known leptons ( @xmath9-like quarks ) belongs to ; on the other hand , the @xmath28-like quarks always belongs to the decuplet @xmath47 .",
    "notice that since the known quarks and leptons belong to different representations of @xmath0 , we have to impose that both quarks and leptons , and not quarks and anti - leptons , have gauge interactions through the left - handed components  @xcite .",
    "the scalars of the model are the usual @xmath48 , here denoted by @xmath49 , with vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath50 ; a complex singlet @xmath51 which is almost the axion ( we note that by considering a complex @xmath48 it is possible to implement the axion in this model  @xcite however this may introduce troubles with proton decay ) . in order to break the @xmath52 symmetry and generate the fermion s dirac masses we use four higgs multiplets : two @xmath53 , and two @xmath54 to avoid the prediction @xmath55 ( the using of @xmath56 for avoiding this mass relation was done in refs .",
    "finally , we add a @xmath37 ( @xmath57 ) and a @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) which contains , respectively , the singlet @xmath60 and the triplet @xmath61 of ref .",

    "the decuplet @xmath57 does not necessarily get a vev at lowest order . since in this model",
    "all scalar s vevs are of the order of the electroweak scale , except @xmath49 and @xmath51 which have vevs of the order of grand unified theory ( gut ) and pq scale , respectively , we have still the hierarchy problem .",

    "right - handed components of neutrinos and the neutral leptons @xmath92 , get also a majorana mass term through the interactions with the axion  @xcite .",
    "we see that the representation content of the model implies that the vector bosons do not induce , at the tree level , the nucleon decay because these interactions involve the usual quarks and heavy leptons ; or heavy quarks with the usual leptons .",

    "the model has no domain wall problem  @xcite .",
    "in order to study the running of the coupling constants in a consistent way with the present model , we augmented the representation content of the model of ref .",
    "hence , we assume that the only extra degrees of freedom that are active at low energies , i.e. , below the unification scale but above the electroweak scale , transforming under the standard model ( sm ) symmetries are ( per family ) : @xmath103 , @xmath104 and the respective singlets @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in the higgs boson sector",

    "the inclusion of the scalar singlet at low energies ( @xmath154 ) gives worse values for this mixing angle so , it must be considered with mass near the unification scale . in fig .  1 we show the evolution of the coupling constants at the 1-loop level in the present model",
    ". an analysis at the 2-loop can be done , but in general it does not lead to a prediction unless the top quark and all extra fermion and scalar fields are taken into account .",
    "this result in a large set of coupled equations  @xcite that deserve more careful study .     in this figure",
    "we show the convergence point for the su(5 ) model here.,width=302,height=264 ]    notice that in this extension of the sm , the yukawa interactions can be similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite but , it is worth noting that , if we want to avoid a general mixing in each charge sector the extra quark ( lepton ) generation must transform under @xmath5 in a different way from those of the usual lepton ( quarks ) . however , we recall that getting a small mixing it can be interesting if in the future a departure from unitarity in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix would be observed  @xcite .",
    "in fact , even the usual three generations can be transformed under @xmath5 different from each other in such a way that predictive mass matrices can be obtained .",
    "as we said before , in this model nucleon decays are forbidden at the tree level . here",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail .",
    "the effective operators with dimension six  @xcite , @xmath155 , that can induce the proton disintegration do not operate in our model because vector leptoquarks always mix the usual fermions with the heavy ones .",
    "however , without the @xmath5 symmetry , there are still dangerous d=4 operators coming from the yukawa couplings with the @xmath156 higgs scalars . for instance , without that discrete symmetry , yukawa interactions like @xmath157 and @xmath158 are allowed .",
    "these terms induce the proton decay through interactions like @xmath159 , and @xmath160 , respectively ; here @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , are color indices , and @xmath163 is the colored scalar triplet belonging to @xmath164 .",
    "once the @xmath5 symmetry is introduced the yukawa interactions allowed are just those given in eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) , and they only induce interactions like @xmath165 and @xmath166 , where the primed fields are heavy quarks , @xmath42 , or heavy leptons , @xmath167 . hence , with the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) , independently of the mixing in the scalar sector , the nucleon is not allowed to decay at the tree level .",
    "the model is in this respect phenomenologically safe .",
    "the @xmath5 symmetry introduced in this model allows effective interactions with flavor changing neutral current .",
    "for instance , @xmath168 here @xmath169 are family indices , and @xmath170 and @xmath171 denote the coupling constant of the @xmath172 and the mass of the ( heavy ) vector boson associated with this symmetry , respectively and @xmath173 are dimensionless constants ( there are also effective interactions induced by the heavy scalar that condensate at very high energies ) . the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) induce rare transitions like @xmath174 . neglecting the electron masses we can write the width of this decay in terms of the muon decay width as follows : @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 are the well - known parameters of the standard model and we see that even if @xmath178 with @xmath179 , we have already got a suppression factor of @xmath180 . however , it is more natural that @xmath171 be of the order of the breakdown of the local @xmath95 symmetry i.e. , at least of the order of the pq scale",
    ". it may be also interesting to assume that @xmath181 at low energies , in such a way that , since @xmath170 which is not an asymptotic free parameter it can fit with @xmath182 at a high energy and the other coupling constant of the low energy model .    just as another example , there are also interactions like @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 is another dimensionless matrix .",
    "when @xmath186 this interaction will induce a contribution to @xmath187 and other related parameters .",
    "notice , however , that @xmath188 we see that this contribution to @xmath187 is rather small for the same values of the @xmath93 parameters in eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) .    in general discrete symmetries may be not free of anomalies .",
    "although it is interesting to looking for cyclic local discrete symmetries that are anomaly free , we would like to emphasize that it is not necessarily a loophole of models with anomalous @xmath93 symmetries .",
    "if @xmath189 the transition violating @xmath190 and @xmath191 conservation induced by the anomaly of the @xmath93 symmetry will be smaller than @xmath192  @xcite , with @xmath193 a model dependent parameter . although this transition is negligible at zero temperature it may be important in earlier ages of the universe as a mechanism for leptogenesis generation through the decays of the heavy neutral leptons if cp violation is implemented in it .",
    "in fact , the model allows several ways to implement baryogenesis and leptogenesis  @xcite as we will shown elsewhere .",
    "summarizing , we have obtained an @xmath0 extension of a previous model of refs .",
    "@xcite , which is as good as susy @xmath0 with respect to the unification of the electroweak and strong interactions .",
    "we also have in this model that the proton is stable and the pq an automatic symmetry of classical lagrangian , with the invisible axion protected against gravitational effects by a local @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the unification of the three coupling constants occurs at the pq scale as in @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that the model does not admit supersymmetry at least at low energies , but we have seen that , in order to have unification , supersymmetry is not an indispensable factor anymore . as it was put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pq energy scale can be related with the mass of the sterile neutrinos  @xcite , and in the present model the pq energy scale is related with the gut scale .",
    "put all this together and we have that in the present model it is possible to have @xmath194 or @xmath195 , depending on the @xmath5 charges assignment .    although the scalar and vector leptoquarks do not induce the nucleon decay at the tree level , their masses are of the order of the unification scale ( they gain masses from the @xmath196 ) . since",
    "this scale is of the order of the pq scale it means that both energy scale can be related to each other . on the other hand , the exotic quarks and leptons @xmath197 gain mass from @xmath198 and @xmath199 which have vevs of the order of the electroweak energy scale and , for this reason , they could not be very heavy .",
    "we recall that the experimental limits on the exotic leptons and quarks like @xmath167 and @xmath42 , respectively , are model dependent but since all of them gain mass from vevs of the order of the electroweak scale they must not be very heavy indeed . for instance , from data we have lower bounds on the masses ( in gev ) of a possible fourth family  @xcite : for sequential @xmath200 charged lepton , we have @xmath201 , cl=@xmath202 ( decay to @xmath203 ) ; for stable charged heavy leptons @xmath204 ,  c.l.=@xmath202 ; for stable neutral heavy lepton the limits are @xmath205 , c.l.=@xmath202 ( dirac ) and @xmath206 , c.l.=@xmath202 ( majorana ) . finally , for extra quarks of the @xmath207-type ( @xmath208 4th generation ) the lower limits are @xmath209 , c.l.=@xmath202 ( quasi - stable @xmath208 ) or @xmath210 , c.l.=@xmath202 ( neutral currents ) ; if it decays in @xmath211 + jets , @xmath212+jets , we have @xmath213 , c.l.=@xmath202 .",
    "of course , these limits are strongly model dependent ( in some models the fourth family is almost degenerate  @xcite ) . on the other hand , as we said before , the model has a general mixing among the fields of the same electric charge sector , thus the generalized unitarity triangle analysis of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix  @xcite can be used for deriving upper bounds on the coefficients of the effective operators inducing such mixings  @xcite .",
    "the model has right - handed neutrinos , so it is possible that an @xmath214 would be more appropriate for the unification of the model of ref .",
    "however since @xmath215 our @xmath0 model is already good enough for implementing a gut theory for the extension of the standard model with proton stability .",

    "<S> we propose an @xmath0 grand unified model with an invisible axion and the unification of the three coupling constants which is in agreement with the values , at @xmath1 , of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a discrete , anomalous , @xmath5 symmetry implies that the peccei - quinn symmetry is an automatic symmetry of the classical lagrangian protecting , at the same time , the invisible axion against possible semi - classical gravity effects . </S>",
    "<S> although the unification scale is of the order of the peccei - quinn scale the proton is stabilized by the fact that in this model the standard model fields form the @xmath0 multiplets completed by new exotic fields and , also , because it is protected by the @xmath5 symmetry . </S>"
