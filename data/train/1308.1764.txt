    "4(c ) as an example , the state evolution cycle is found to follow roughly : @xmath231 despite the rich dynamical behavior of the diagonal elements @xmath215 and @xmath211 , the off - diagonal elements , @xmath210 ( the green lines ) , are insensitive to the changes in control parameters , and to the removal or addition of the tls , which pins @xmath232 to roughly 1.7 .",
    "it is thus concluded that the generation of macroscopic quantum superposition states is robust under various changes of parameter sets including the removal of the tls .",
    "note that , as can be expected , the additional effect imposed by the tls is of the order of @xmath233 and will become negligible as the number of spins @xmath16 in the spin bath goes to infinite .",
    "an extension to the spin - boson model has been proposed by including an additional spin bath in a spin - star configuration in an effort to study : 1 ) the polarization dynamics of the tls under the influence of the two dissimilar baths ; and 2 ) the macroscopic quantum superposition state generation in the spin bath . by incorporating two limiting cases in which the dynamics can be solved exactly ,",
    "effects of the two baths on the tls have been investigated first .",
    "steady states can be reached in the presence of a boson bath with a continuous spectral density .",
    "it is found that the steady flipping of the tls is aided by a finite tls - spin - bath coupling strength .",
    "this can be understood from thermodynamic considerations as spin - bath states with a negative magnetic number @xmath39 has a large boltzmann weight favoring a unity value of @xmath101 with the increasing t - s coupling @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the bath - bath correlation @xmath29 plays a destructive role in the tls flipping .",
    "more interestingly , the spin bath has a sizable effect on tls thermalization even when there is no direct interaction between the tls and the spin bath . for the transient process , analogous to the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite , optimal flipping occurs at an intermediate t - s coupling strength , the value of which is sensitive to the bath - bath correlation . for large enough t - s coupling",
    ", the tls flips unidirectionally barring minor oscillations of minute amplitudes .",
    "lastly , we have studied the mqs state generation in the spin bath under the influence of the boson bath and the tls . given that mqs can be achieved in the absence of the tls , the effect of adding the tls on mqs has been investigated . in the presence of strong t - b coupling , the quasi - period of evolution",
    "can be reduced roughly by half .",
    "rich dynamics can appear as the t - s coupling is increased , such as the emergence of a fully mixed state of @xmath218 and @xmath218 before @xmath232 is reached , a phenomenon that is absent if the spin bath is only coupled to the boson bath ( without the tls ) .",
    "it is also found that the generation of mqs states is robust against parameter variance including the removal of the tls due to the insensitivity of the off - diagonal elements of the reduce density matrix .",

    "<S> we study dynamics of a two - level system coupled simultaneously to a pair of dissimilar reservoirs , namely , a spin bath and a boson bath , which are connected via finite interbath coupling . it is found that the steady - state energy transfer in the two - level system increases with its coupling to the spin bath while optimal transfer occurs at intermediate coupling in the transient process . if the two - level system is strongly coupled to the spin bath , the population transfer is unidirectional barring minor population oscillations of minute amplitudes . if the spin bath is viewed as an atomic ensemble , robust generation of macroscopic superposition states exists against parameter variations of the two - level system and the boson bath . </S>"
