    "since any face of a simplex is also a simplex , the topological structure of the complex @xmath13 , i.e. , the set @xmath2 is uniquely determined by the set of _ maximal simplices _ under inclusion .",

    "the transfer of data from two to three dimensions is performed in accordance with some local relations ( constraints or laws ) defined on plaquettes of the lattice .",
    "since the data on points of the three - dimensional lattice are overdetermined , the control of compatibility of relations is necessary .",
