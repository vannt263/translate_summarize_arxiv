    "hadron yield correlations , measured by the ratios of the average yields of different hadrons produced in high - energy reactions , are one kind of characteristic properties of hadronization mechanisms .",
    "it is usually expected that these correlations are more or less independent of the particular model especially when the combination mechanism is concerned .",
    "such properties were therefore considered as a good probe for the hadronization mechanism in different high - energy reactions already in the 1970s to 1990s @xcite .",
    "the study of these correlations has attracted much attention in heavy - ion collisions recently @xcite because they are considered as a probe to test whether the ( re-)combination mechanism is at work .",
    "this is interesting because whether the combination mechanism works might be considered as one of the signatures for the formation of the bulk color - deconfined quark matter system before the hadronization takes place .",
    "experimental results are available from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite , from relatively low - energy collisions such as those obtained by na49 , na61 , and cbm collaborations at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) @xcite , and more recently from the very high energy reactions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "these results seem to suggest a dramatic change for collisions from lower to higher energies , which is considered as one of the hints for phase transition @xcite .    in order to make a judgment whether the combination mechanism is at work by comparing the theoretical results with the corresponding experimental data , it is important to see whether , if so , to what extent , the theoretical results depend on the particular model used in obtaining these results .",
    "there are many studies that have been made in the literature @xcite .",
    "these studies are usually based on some particular ( re-)combination or coalescence models and/or some particular assumptions .",
    "it is not clear whether the results obtained depend on the particular assumption(s ) made in these particular models . for this purpose , in this paper , we will make a systematic study of the average yields of different identified hadrons and their relationships obtained in the combination mechanism .",
    "we will start the study by considering the case for the combination of a system of quarks and antiquarks from the basic ideas of the combination mechanism .",
    "we will make the study as independent of the particular models as possible but present the assumptions and/or inputs explicitly whenever necessary .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the formulas for calculating the average yields of hadrons and their relationships in the combination of a system of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "we consider a system where the number of quarks and that of antiquarks are equal and discuss the net quark influence as well .",
    "we compare the results with the available data in sec .",
    ", the experimental results from the lhc @xcite are taken as an example to test the predictions for the case where the net quark influence is considered as negligible , while those from the rhic and the sps @xcite are used to test the net quark influence .",
    "a short summary is presented in sec .",
    "in this section , we begin with the general formalism of hadron yields in the combination models based on the basic ideas . for this purpose , we start with a quark - antiquark system as general as possible",
    ". then we simplify the results by using some explicit assumptions , simplifications , and/or approximations .",
    "we present the results for the ratios of the yields of hadrons directly produced as well as those including the contributions from the resonance decays .",
    "we start with the most general case and consider a system of @xmath0 quarks and @xmath1 antiquarks .",
    "we denote the number of quarks of flavor @xmath2 by @xmath3 so that @xmath4 and similarly @xmath5 .",
    "these quarks and antiquarks combine with each other to form the color singlet hadrons .",
    "the number density of the directly produced hadrons is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the momentum distributions for the produced meson @xmath9 and baryon @xmath10 , respectively ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the two- and three - particle joint momentum distributions for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the kernel functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for the probability density for @xmath17 and @xmath18 with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 to combine into a meson @xmath9 of momentum @xmath21 and that for @xmath17 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 with momenta @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath24 to coalescence into a baryon @xmath10 of momentum @xmath25 . here , in the arguments",
    ", we use @xmath3 and @xmath26 to represent the dependence of these functions on the numbers of the quarks and antiquarks of different flavors , and also on the total collision energy @xmath27 of @xmath28 reactions .",
    "we note in particular that not only the joint distributions @xmath29 and @xmath30 but also the probability densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are in general dependent on @xmath3 and @xmath26 .",
    "this is because , for finite @xmath3 and @xmath26 , the probability for a given quark @xmath17 to combine with a specified antiquark @xmath33 to form a specified meson @xmath9 or two other specified quarks @xmath34 to form a baryon @xmath10 is in general dependent on the number @xmath3 of existing quarks of different flavors and the number @xmath26 of antiquarks .",
    "we note in particular the relationship between the description presented here and those given in the literature in different models based on the combination mechanism such as the coalescence model @xcite , the recombination model @xcite , and the quark combination model @xcite developed by different groups .",
    "( [ eq : mgenal ] ) and ( [ eq : bgenal ] ) are intended to be the general formulas based on the basic ideas of the combination mechanism .",
    "the different models are examples of the general case that we considered in these equations . in these models , different method(s ) and/or assumption(s ) are usually introduced to construct the precise form of the kernel functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 in order to provide a good description of different properties of the hadrons , such as momentum distributions and so on .",
    "for example , in the recombination model developed by hwa and collaborators @xcite , these kernel functions are just the recombination functions .",
    "the joint distributions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number densities that satisfy @xmath35 respectively , where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the numbers of all the possible @xmath38 s and @xmath39 s in the bulk quark - antiquark system that we consider . for the convenience of comparison ,",
    "we rewrite them as @xmath40so that the distributions are normalized to unity where we denote by using the superscript ( @xmath41 ) , i.e. , @xmath42 in terms of these normalized joint distributions , we have @xmath43 integrating over @xmath21 or @xmath25 from the momentum distributions , we obtain the average numbers of the directly produced mesons @xmath9 and baryons @xmath10 as @xmath44 for a reaction at a given energy , the average numbers of quarks , @xmath45 , and those for the antiquarks , @xmath46 , of different flavors are fixed .",
    "the numbers of quarks and antiquarks follow a certain distribution which we denote by @xmath47 .",
    "the average yields of mesons and baryons are given by @xmath48    these equations are the general formalism for calculating the average yield of a certain sort of hadrons in high - energy reactions based on the basic ideas of the combination mechanism .",
    "more specific results can be obtained for special cases when special assumptions are made about the distributions and/or the kernel functions .",
    "we present such cases step by step in the following .        in terms of the total average numbers of mesons and baryons , the average number of a specified meson @xmath9 and that of a specified baryon @xmath10 are given by @xmath75 the parts describing the flavor dependence of the kernel functions , @xmath76 and @xmath57 , have to guarantee flavor conservation in the combination process .",
    "hence , they contain the kronecker @xmath77 s and constant factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "for example , for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , they are given by @xmath82 we recall that , in the factorized case considered here , the flavor - dependent part @xmath76 of the kernel function represents the probability for the specified @xmath83 with the specified flavor @xmath17 and @xmath33 from the system consisting of @xmath0 quarks and @xmath1 antiquarks to form the specified meson @xmath9 under the condition that they are known to form a meson .",
    "although we can not prove it , it is very unlikely that this probability still depends strongly on the environment .",
    "we therefore consider the simplified case where @xmath78 is taken as a constant independent of @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the same applies to @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 stands for the number of possible iterations of @xmath86 which is @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for three identical flavor , two different flavor , and three different flavor cases , respectively .    in the case when only @xmath90 and @xmath91 mesons and @xmath92 and @xmath93 baryons are considered , we have , for mesons , @xmath94 where @xmath95 represents the ratio of the @xmath96 vector mesons to the @xmath90 pseudoscalar mesons of the same flavor composition ; and for baryons , @xmath97 except that @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . here",
    ", @xmath101 stands for the ratio of the @xmath102 octet to the @xmath103 decuplet baryons of the same flavor composition .",
    "the two parameters @xmath95 and @xmath101 can be determined by using the data from different high - energy reactions @xcite .",
    "we consider three flavors @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 of quarks and antiquarks . inside the system of @xmath0 quarks and @xmath1 antiquarks ,",
    "we suppose that each quark can take flavor @xmath105 , @xmath106 , or @xmath107 with given probability @xmath108 , @xmath109 , or @xmath110 independent of the others . in this case",
    ", the numbers of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 quarks inside the system at a given @xmath0 obey the multinominal distribution , i.e. , @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 is the effective strangeness suppression factor for quarks .",
    "similarly , for the antiquarks , we have @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is the strangeness suppression factor for antiquark production .    in general , in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the system contains the contributions of the net quarks coming from the incident nuclei .",
    "hence the effective strangeness suppression factor @xmath114 for the quarks is different from @xmath118 for the antiquarks , which do not have influence from the net quarks . here ,",
    "we keep them as distinguished from each other so that we can apply the results to different cases .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize that the system considered corresponds to a quark - antiquark system produced in an @xmath28 collision in a limited kinematic region .",
    "the system is supposed to be a small part of the whole quark - antiquark system produced in the reaction so that the influence from the global flavor compensation is considered to be negligible .",
    "the global flavor compensation can have some influence on the flavor correlation in hadron production .",
    "such a case was for example discussed in @xcite for baryon - antibaryon flavor correlation in @xmath119 annihilation where the number of quarks was of the order of tens and the average yield of baryons in an event was less than one .",
    "it was found that , even in that case , the global flavor compensation does have some effect on the flavor correlation but the effect is not very large .",
    "hence , for simplicity and clarity , we neglect them in the discussion here .    at given @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we average over the distribution of the numbers of quarks and/or antiquarks for different flavors .",
    "it can easily be shown that , for @xmath120 , @xmath121 and similarly for others , so we obtain @xmath122    for a subsystem of quarks and antiquarks in a given kinematic region in @xmath28 collisions at given energy @xmath27 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are fixed while @xmath125 and @xmath1 follow the distributions @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "hence , we need to average over these distributions and obtain @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are functions of @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath27 and stand for the average total number of the mesons and that of the baryons produced in the combination process .",
    "they are given by @xmath133    we see that , in this case , for the directly produced hadrons , the ratios of the yields of different mesons , those of different baryons and those of the antibaryons separately are constants depending on the parameters @xmath118 , @xmath114 , @xmath95 and @xmath101 . in general the effective strangeness suppression factor @xmath114 for quarks contains the influence from the net quark contributions and can be dependent on @xmath134 and @xmath132 .",
    "this leads to a dependence on @xmath134 and @xmath132 even for such kinds of hadron yield ratios . in the case",
    "that the net quark contribution is negligible , we have @xmath135 ; these kinds of hadron yield ratios become constants independent of @xmath134 and @xmath132 .",
    "this should be the case for a subsample in the central rapidity region of the bulk quark - antiquark system produced in @xmath28 collisions at very high energies such as those at the lhc . in this case , we have also @xmath136 and this , together with @xmath137 , leads to @xmath138 .",
    "these are predictions that can be checked at the lhc .      including the decay contributions",
    ", we calculate the yields of different hadrons in the final state .",
    "we denote the decay contribution from a hadron @xmath139 to @xmath140 by @xmath141 and obtain @xmath142 where we use the superscript @xmath143 to denote the results for the final hadrons to differentiate them from those for the directly produced hadrons .",
    "here we consider only the influence from the decay of the short - lived hadrons but do not consider the influences from the final - state interactions of the hadrons .",
    "the value of @xmath141 can be obtained easily from the materials given by the particle data group @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we take the strong and the electromagnetic decays into account . for most of the hadrons ,",
    "the results look very simple . in the case in which only @xmath90 and @xmath91 mesons and @xmath102 and @xmath144 baryons are included , the average yields of final hadrons , e.g. , @xmath145 , @xmath81 , and @xmath146 , are given as @xmath147    we consider the case discussed in sec .",

    "we see that , like for protons , the results for many final baryons look even simpler than those for the directly produced cases since the corresponding decuplet baryons decay strongly to these baryons .",
