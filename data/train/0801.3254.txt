    "some of them do not have counterparts in other wavebands .",
    "seeking their galactic counterparts in other wavebands could play a key role for us to understand the origin of these sources and distinguish different acceleration mechanisms to emit tev @xmath3-rays . among identified counterparts ,",
    "young shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) are one of the four galactic populations to generate very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath3-rays , i.e. pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , x - ray binaries , shell snrs and a young stellar cloud westerlund 2 ( aharonian et al .",

    "recently , the old snr w41 has been proposed to associate with the extended tev source hess j1834 - 087 based on observations ( tian et al .",
    "2007 ; leahy & tian 2008 ) , which is theoretically expected ( yamazaki et al .",
    "2006 , fang & zhang 2008 ) . however , this is the only likely association of an old snr with a tev source up to now .",
    "we report here the discovery of a new faint radio and x - ray shell which closely matches the extended tev source hess j1731 - 347 without previously identified counterpart ( aharonian et al .",
    "we use new radio , infrared and x - ray data to identify the shell as an old snr , therefore obtaining second association of a tev source with an old snr .",
    "the 1420 mhz radio continuum and 21 cm hi emission data sets come from the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) which is described in detail by haverkorn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    ". the sgps images the hi line emission and 1420  mhz continuum in the range 253@xmath4 and @xmath5 , mostly in the fourth quadrant of our galaxy , with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the parkes 64 m single dish telescope .",
    "the continuum observations have a resolution of 100  arcsec and a sensitivity better than 1  mjy / beam .",
    "the hi data have an angular resolution of 2  arcmin , a rms sensitivity of @xmath11  k and a velocity resolution of 1  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we combined the atca and parkes data to estimate the flux density of the snr , because the parkes data properly includes scales of around 0.5@xmath2 as well , where the atca becomes less sensitive .",
    "the vicinity of snr g353.6 - 0.7 was observed by the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on the rosat x - ray observatory during the all - sky survey in 1993 for a total source integration time of 300 seconds ( rs932341n00 ) .",
    "we obtained an exposure - corrected intensity image of the remnant in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band , smoothed with adaptive gaussian kernel to achieve signal - to - noise ratio @xmath1 5 ( see fig .",
    "the new snr has a nearly - circular shell - type structure with angular size of 0.5@xmath7 centred at ( _ l _ , _",

    "a bright compact hii region g353.42 - 0.37 is adjacent to the west of the snr .",
    "the 1420 mhz image reveals a clear filament along its south boundary . the 843 mhz image from the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most , green et al .",
    "1999 ) also shows the filament .",
    "the filament of the snr is also seen at 5 ghz by parkes observations ( haynes et al .",
    "1978 ) , but not as clearly asat 1420 mhz or 843 mhz due to the lower spatial resolution ( 4.1@xmath8 ) .",
    "a few compact sources within the remnant are resolved in both sgps and most maps . specifically , the bright source g353.45 - 0.68 is close to the center of the snr .",
    "the sgps image has a lower resolution ( 100 arcsec ) but higher sensitivity ( @xmath91  mjy / beam ) than the 843  mhz map ( 43  arcsec and 1 to 2  mjy / beam ) .",
    "the sgps image shows more faint emission than the most map because the most image misses short - spacings more severely than for the sgps .",
    "the 1420  mhz and 843  mhz images have similar shell - type outlines for the snr .",
    "21 cm weak polarized emission is seen toward the south filament of snr g353.6 - 0.7 . however , smoothing the same data with a resolution of 5 arcmin to enhance any extended features shows no convincing polarized emission coming from snr g353.6 - 0.7 .",
    "absence of observable polarization is consistent with the expectation of complete depolarization at a distance of @xmath101 kpc toward the galactic centre .",
    "we derive an integrated flux density of 2.2@xmath110.9 jy for g353.6 - 0.7 at 1420 mhz by a new method .",
    "we azimuthally averaged the radio intensity in rings around the center of the remnant .",
    "only one half of the remnant , the part at lowest galactic latitudes , was used because the half closest to the galactic plane is confused with other sources .",
    "the integrated flux density has excluded the contribution from a few compact sources ( e.g. g353.45 - 0.68 ) within the remnant .",
    "1 ( lower right ) shows radio flux as a function of radius of the remnant in diamonds .",
    "the background was estimated as the average intensity at radius @xmath12 and subtracted from the averaged flux .",
    "the profile of the remnant was estimated by a polynomial .",
    "this profile was integrated over radius from the center of the remnant out to @xmath13 and over @xmath14 in angle , which resulted in a total flux density estimate of @xmath15  jy .",
    "the 843 mhz data misses too many low spatial frequency components to be used to obtain a reliable flux density .",
    "however , we obtain an integrated flux density of 1.4@xmath110.3 jy at 5 ghz by same above method , giving a spectral index of @xmath16=0.4@xmath17 ( s@xmath18 ) consistent with a non - thermal feature .",

    "based on the fact that a number of hess sources are detected where high - energy particle accelerators are located near h ii regions , and other such accelerators without proximate sources of low - energy photons are weak or undetected at tev energies , helfand et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that tev emissions of hess sources could originate from inverse compton scattering of the starlight from the nearby h ii regions .",
    "given the proximity of bright hii regions to several hess sources , snr g353.6 - 0.7 may be at @xmath1 3.2 kpc , same as g353.42 - 0.37 .",
    "we have also obtained the absorption spectrum of compact source g353.45 - 0.68 , and derived that this source is likely an extragalactic source due to absorption features in the whole negative velocity range .",
    "therefore , we exclude a possibility that g353.45 - 0.68 is a pulsar or pulsar wind nebula .",
    "( 80,80 ) ( -20,-10 )      we analyze new high resolution data ( images ) at 8@xmath0 m from the galactic legacy infrared midplane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) legacy project ( benjamin et al .",

    "these images ( all are centred at [ b=353.6 , l=-0.7 ] ) , show no thermal emission down to a limit of 0.4 mjy ( 5 @xmath22 ) at 8@xmath0 m and 200 mjy at 21@xmath0 m associated with g353.6 - 0.7 .",
    "this supports above - mentioned conclusion that g353.6 - 0.7 has a non - thermal emission character and is a new snr .    the lower left panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the rosat x - ray image of snr g353.6 - 0.7 in the the soft band ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission appears only within the lower - latitude half of the radio remnant .",
    "the coincidence of the x - ray morphology with the radio morphology ( two bright x - ray sources overlap the radio filaments along snr - shell , and both the x - ray and the radio emission have same shape ) suggests that they are physically associated .",
    "the fact that x - rays are detected from only the lower half is likely due to absorption blocking x - rays from the upper half .",
    "this is supported by the available low resolution 12co maps of this area ( dame et al .",
    "2001 ) , showing increasing column density toward the galactic plane .",
    "the estimated unabsorbed x - ray flux of snr g353.6 - 0.7 is @xmath1 8 @xmath23 10@xmath24 ergs @xmath25 s@xmath6 in the energy band of 1 - 2 kev ( the energy band below 1 kev is affected by absorption ) by fitting the rosat spectrum with a thermal plasma model ( i.e. xspec mekal with a fitted temperature kt @xmath26 2.8 kev ) .",
    "this flux is corresponding to a luminosity of 9.8@xmath23 10@xmath27 ergs s@xmath6 assuming a distance of @xmath1 3.2 kpc . due to low number of x - ray counts ,",
    "this model is quite uncertain .",
    "the rosat spectrum is extracted from the lower half of snr g353.6 - 0.7 ( half circle with radius of @xmath28 ) centered on the remnant .",
    "snr g353.6 - 0.7 has a large angular size and a large physical size ( @xmath1 28 pc in diameter for a likely distance of @xmath1 3.2 kpc ) , and faint radio and x - ray emissions .",
    "this suggests that g353.6 - 0.7 is quite old , because young snrs ( @xmath29 2000 yrs ) usually have a size @xmath9 10 pc , and produce strong radio and x - ray emission .",
    "applying the sedov model ( cox 1972 ) , we estimate its age based on the known radius r ( 14 pc ) and ambient density @xmath30 assuming a typical explosion energy ( 10@xmath31 erg ) . the likely absorption of x - rays from the western half of g353.6 - 0.7 hints that ambient density @xmath30 is not very low .",
    "the density @xmath30 can be estimated from the @xmath3 flux of hess j1731 - 347 ( @xmath32@xmath331.2@xmath2310@xmath34 @xmath25 s@xmath6 which is given by @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36=0.5 tev , @xmath37=2.26@xmath110.10 , @xmath38=6.1@xmath110.8 @xmath2310@xmath24 @xmath25 s@xmath6 .",
    "see aharonian et al .",
    "2008 ) . using the formulae 1 and 2 of aharonian et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we obtain the @xmath30 of @xmath1 5 @xmath39 ( assuming a conversion efficiency of 0.1 - 0.2 and explosion energy 10@xmath31 erg ) .",
    "if g353.6 - 0.7 is still in the sedov - taylor phase , it has a sedov age of @xmath1 25000 yrs .",
    "however , the radius at which cooling affects the dynamics of an snr is @xmath1 10 pc for @xmath30 @xmath33 5 @xmath39 , so g353.6 - 0.7 has already entered the radiative phase .",
    "so we here obtain a radiative age of @xmath1 27000 yrs for g353.6 - 0.7 .",
    "the observations from radio , x - ray and @xmath3-ray all indicate that snr g353.6 - 0.7 is the counterpart of the newly detected tev @xmath3-ray source hess j1731 - 347 ( see fig .",
    "the tev @xmath3-rays overlap the entire radio snr , including the east half seen in x - rays and the west half not seen in x - rays .",
    "the @xmath40co column density increases toward the galactic plane , consistent with absorbing the x - rays from the west half of the snr , but allowing both radio and tev @xmath3-rays to be observed .",
    "old snrs emitting tev @xmath3-rays are rare .",
    "w41 has been considered as the only likely candidate so far ( tian et al .",
    "young snrs found to show @xmath3-ray emission have @xmath41 of typically below @xmath12 , @xmath42 of typically below @xmath110 ( yamazaki et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the flux density of g353.6 - 0.7 is s@xmath43@xmath33 2.2 jy , giving an integrated flux from 10@xmath44 to 10@xmath45 hz of f@xmath46=5.2 @xmath23 10@xmath47 ergs @xmath25 s@xmath6 , assuming a radio spectral index of @xmath1 0.5 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath3-ray flux of f@xmath48 @xmath33 1.7@xmath23 10@xmath34 ergs @xmath25 s@xmath6 in the 1 - 10 tev band , so the ratio r = f@xmath49/f@xmath46 is @xmath1 33 .",
    "also given a distance of 3.2 kpc to g353.6 - 0.7 , the @xmath3-ray luminosity is @xmath1 2@xmath2310@xmath50 ergs s@xmath6 in the 1 - 10 tev range , which is larger than that of rx j1713.7 - 3946 , one of the intrinsically brightest galactic tev gamma - ray sources discovered and thought to originate from pion decays .",
    "so , snr g353.6 - 0.7 is a powerful cosmic ray accelerator .",
    "the theoretically predicted @xmath3-rays to x - rays flux ratio for old snrs is possibly @xmath10 100 ( yamazaki et al .",
    "2006 ) , giving an upper limit to 2 - 10 kev x - ray emission from g353.6 - 0.7 of about 1.7@xmath23 10@xmath34 ergs @xmath25 s@xmath6 .",
    "we checked the integral survey which covers g353.6 - 0.7 and found no detection within the snr ( jem - x in energy range of 5 - 20 kev ) . assuming an individual integral observation for an integration time of 2 ks , the 5 @xmath22 source detection limit is 1.2@xmath23 10@xmath51 ergs @xmath25 s@xmath6 on - axis in the energy range of 2 - 10 kev ( brandt et al .",
    "this is consistent with the derived x - ray upper limit flux from the old snr .",
    "the fact that the x - rays are visible in snr g353.6 - 0.7 shows that snr shock velocity is still fast .",
    "this means that g353.6 - 0.7 is not too old ( i.e. @xmath910@xmath52 yrs ) , because an old snr is expected to emit few thermal x - rays which originate from the high temperature gas heated by the fast - enough shock .",
    "because of poor statistics in the rosat x - ray spectrum , we can not exclude that part of the x - rays are from synchrotron emission . because no pulsar / pwn is detected within the remnant until now by radio and x - ray observations ,",
    "it is unlikely that the tev @xmath3-rays originate from particles accelerated to high energy at a termination shock formed in the pulsar wind .",
    "this strengthens our conclusion that the tev @xmath3-rays originate from the old snr .",
    "tev @xmath3-rays can originate from an old snr or from a molecular cloud encountered by the snr , via pion decay with the pions produced by proton - proton collisions ( yamazaki et al .",
    "co observations can detect all co cloud components in the direction of g353.6 - 0.7 , therefore help to confirm and distinguish different acceleration mechanisms for emission of tev @xmath3-rays .",
    "e.g. if there was a co cloud overlapping the radio , x and @xmath3-ray emissions at the same distance as snr g353.6 - 0.7 , and if a broadened co emission profile was detected , indicating a shock interaction , it would be a strong argument to support the snr interacting with the cloud to emit tev @xmath3-ray emission .",
    "however , the existing @xmath40co observations in the direction of g353.6 - 0.7 have too low resolution ( 1/8 degree ) to give any constraint regarding snr - co cloud interaction .",
    "further high - resolution co and deep x - ray observations can be used to reveal the real radiative mechanism for tev emission .",
