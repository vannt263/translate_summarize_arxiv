    "the development of quantum information processing has enabled the discovery of new techniques and platforms which are paving the way to accomplish quantum technologies in the near future .",
    "@xcite among these platforms , spin qubits in quantum dots ( qds)@xcite is certainly one of the most striking systems because of their potential scalability and miniaturization .",
    "@xcite furthermore , electrical readout and control of spins qubits in qds have been achieved in several different approaches ,  @xcite where spin blockade and charge sensors enable the observation of single / two - spin dynamics .",
    "@xcite in double quantum dots ( dqds ) , a logical qubit can be encoded by means of singlet - triplet ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) states of two electron spins  @xcite and the inter - qubit interaction can be implemented through a capacitive coupling .",
    "@xcite by controling and coupling @xmath1-@xmath2 qubits , the entanglement between two @xmath1-@xmath2 qubits has been experimentally demonstrated .  @xcite",
    "together with the success of such a demonstration , the ubiquitous noise has been probed in the experimental data of ref .  [ ] . for a single @xmath1-@xmath2 qubit , the noise has been characterized and shown to be consistent with the power - law 1/f@xmath0 noise .",
    "@xcite also , it has been experimentally verified that the expoent @xmath3 has a temperature dependence ; for instance , @xmath4 for t=50  mk and @xmath5 for t= 100  mk .",
    "@xcite such a temperature dependence can be ascribed to phonon - induced decoherence mechanism .",
    "@xcite the 1/f@xmath0 noise can be present in a variety of systems  @xcite and particullarly in other qds systems .",
    "@xcite to model the 1/f@xmath0 noise , random telegraph noise ( rtn ) has been employed in different theoretical works .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we employ the rtn to describe the decoherence caused by the interaction between two @xmath1-@xmath2 qubits and their environment in the low temperature limit ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath6 . by using such a model , we are able to quantitatively reproduce experimental results obtained for @xmath1-@xmath2 qubits in two gaas coupled dqds .",
    "@xcite through our description of this open quantum system , we exploit the role of the amplitude of the rtn , the correlation time of the rtn , the preparation time of states , and the two - qubit coupling in the entanglement dissipative dynamics .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present the model that describes the dynamics of the open quantum system . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the concept of entanglement , measured by concurrence , together with results of our theoretical model .",
    "we also include in sec .",
    "iii a detailed study on the most important physical parameters that rules the entanglement dynamics . finally , sec .",
    "iv contains a summary of our results .",
    "the main focus of this work is related to the study of the dissipative dynamics of two @xmath1-@xmath2 qubits , where the information is stored in the spin states of two electrons .",
    "such states can be experimentally achieved by confining two electrons in each dqd system .",
    "@xcite the logical qubit composed by the two - level system ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) can be isolated by applying an external magnetic field in the plane of the device in such a way that the zeeman splitting makes the parallel spin states @xmath9 and @xmath10 energetically inaccessible .    to extend such a two - level system to a two - qubit system",
    ", it is necessary to couple two @xmath1-@xmath2 qubits , where the tunnelling between them is suppressed and their coupling is electrostatic ( for more details , see ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "thus , the effective hamiltonian for the two - qubit system can be written as follows :  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the pauli spin matrices , @xmath13 is the identity and the index 1 ( 2 ) is related to the first ( second ) qubit ( hereafter , we use units of @xmath14 ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is able to implement universal quantum control , which is given by two physically distinct local operations , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and by the interaction between the qubits given by @xmath17 .",
    "the exchange splitting , @xmath18 , between @xmath19 and @xmath20 applies rotations in the qubit @xmath21=1,2 around the @xmath16 axis , while rotations around the @xmath15 axis are driven by a magnetic field gradient @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 is responsible for the preparation of each qubit in a superposition between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the two - qubit coupling , @xmath25 , depends on the energy between levels of the left and the right dqd and it can be switched on and off during the quantum dynamics .",
    "@xcite due to the pauli exclusion principle , @xmath23 and @xmath24 states have different charge configurations and because both qubits are electrostatically coupled , the state of the first qubit is conditioned to the state of the second qubit . in other words ,",
    "when simultaneously evolving , they experience a dipole - dipole coupling that generates an entangled state . following the experimental steps ,",
    "@xcite each qubit is initialized in the @xmath23 state , then rotated by @xmath26 around the @xmath15 axis when @xmath27 , @xmath28 , for i=1,2 . after this stage ,",
    "a large exchange splitting is switched on corresponding to @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "experimentally , it was found that the two - qubit coupling is given by @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite    to include the dissipative dynamics , we consider a phenomenological approach , where both qubits are subjected to local rtn fluctuations on exchange splitting terms @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the rtn - hamiltonian can be written as @xmath34 for such a kind of noise , @xmath35 jumps between two values @xmath36 and @xmath37 according to@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the function @xmath40 is related to the times where the jumps occur by the following expression @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the heaviside function and @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ tjk ] ) , @xmath44 are uniformly distributed random numbers and the correlation time @xmath45 determines the frequency of jumps and is related to the autocorrelation function as follows @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents an average over the fluctuations .",
    "the results for the @xmath48 are shown in fig .  1 , considering @xmath49 mhz and @xmath50 ns ( black - solid curve in the top panel ) and @xmath51 ns ( red - dashed curve in the bottom panel ) . as expected ,",
    "there are less jumps for a higher value of @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , to check the 1/f@xmath0 nature of the rtn , we numerically calculate the power spectrum @xmath52 , which is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function ( eq .",
    "( [ autocorr ] ) ) .",
    "such results are shown in fig .  2 for a fixed amplitude @xmath49 mhz and for different correlation times : @xmath53 ns ( magenta dotted curve ) , @xmath50 ns ( black solid curve ) , and @xmath51 ns ( blue dashed curve ) . the solid red curve in fig .",
    "2 is a plot of the function @xmath54 , which is used for comparison to the high frequency behavior of the numerically calculated power spectrum @xmath52 .",
    "such a power - law noise model is similar to the one deduced for only one qubit in dqds .",

    "the function c/@xmath55 is plotted as a solid red curve for comparison.,width=302 ]    to perform the analysis of our results and to compare to the experimental work ,  @xcite the quantum correlation called concurrence is employed .",
    "concurrence is a well known measure of entanglement , which is broadly accepted to be responsible for a set of important tasks in quantum information theory , such as quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum key distribution .",

    "the initial state of each dqd is set to @xmath64 , then a @xmath26 rotation around the @xmath15 axis is performed during the preparation time @xmath65 , which puts each qubit in a superposed state @xmath66 . following the experimental description given in ref .",

    "the system dynamics can be obtained by numerically solving the unitary trajectories described by the system hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ ham ] ) ) together with the rtn hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ hamrtn ] ) ) .",

    "open circles denote the ddses extracted from experimental data .",
    "@xcite , width=302 ]    we begin our analysis of the dynamics of the system through the evolution in time of the difference of the descending sorted eigenvalues ( ddse ) @xmath71 of the matrix @xmath59 , which is equal to the concurrence @xmath72 when it assumes positive values . in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , we plot @xmath71 as function of time",
    ", assuming different values for the rtn amplitude @xmath70 and for @xmath73  ns . when @xmath74 , the dynamics is unitary and the concurrence oscillates without dissipation with a period of @xmath75 ns after @xmath65 .",
    "such a period is completely defined by the system hamiltonian term @xmath76 .",
    "ddse assume zero values for @xmath77 when @xmath74 , but the first experimental value of ddse at @xmath78  ns is negative and it must be related to noise effects that occur during the preparation of the state @xmath66 . such a negative value occurs during the preparation time as a result of the interaction of the @xmath26 rotation around the @xmath15 direction and the rtn , which acts in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "indeed , to take into account such a negative value of ddse , we just need to use @xmath79  ns and @xmath80 , as can be observed in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , one can see in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) that the ddse oscillates in time and it has an envelope function that decays faster as the value of @xmath70 is increased .",
    "we also perform an analysis of ddse as a function of time for a fixed value of the rtn amplitude @xmath81 mhz and different correlation times @xmath45 , which is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) ) .",
    "the increasing of the correlation time has a similar effect when compared to the increasing of the rtn amplitude in fig .",

    "there is a good matching between experimental results ( open circles in figs .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) and ddse extracted from the dynamics including the rtn .",
    "results shown in figs .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) might suggest that it is possible to find different pairs of @xmath45 and @xmath70 that adjust the experimental data , but this conception is misleading because other pairs of @xmath45 and @xmath70 can not reproduce the experimental data in whole range of time .    by means of our description of the decoherence mechanism , we can analyze the entanglement dissipative dynamics through our theoretical model . particularly , we focus on two aspects : the role of the preparation time @xmath65 and the two - qubit coupling @xmath25 .",
    "the system is interacting with the environment during the preparation time , which affects the entanglement efficiency . to understand the role of such a physical parameter , we analyse effects on the maximum value of concurrence caused by distinct preparation times @xmath65 .",
    "another crucial physical parameter that rules the entanglement is the coupling between each qubit .",
    "the two - qubit coupling @xmath25 , that can be increased by controlling the dipole - dipole interaction , determines the time @xmath83 for achieving the state with highest value of entanglement ( concurrence ) .",
    "this time @xmath83 can be extracted from the term @xmath84 of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and is given by @xmath85 .",
    "in the experimental results , @xmath86 and the maximum obtained value for entanglement is around @xmath87 .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath73 ns and @xmath82.,width=302 ]    to illustrate the role of the preparation time and the dependency on the two - qubit coupling @xmath25 in the entanglement dynamics , we plot in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) the maximum value of concurrence as a function of @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the value extracted from the experimental data , for different preparation times @xmath65 .",
    "as expected , such results show an enhancement of the entanglement when @xmath25 is increased and when @xmath65 is decreased .",
    "this behavior is related to the fact that a maximally entangled configuration is faster achieved for a larger @xmath25 even though the rtn disturbs the ideal obtainment of the superposed state during the preparation time @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) , one can see that for @xmath92 the maximum value of entanglement is approximately constant .",
    "furthermore , a small increase in the value of @xmath25 surprisingly enhances the maximum value of entanglement , as can be observed by the steep jump in @xmath93 for a small variation of r in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) . to understand further how these characteristic times affect the maximally entangled state , in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) , we plot the maximum value of concurrence as a function of @xmath65 for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "one can notice in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) that the maximum concurrence monotonically decreases as a function of @xmath65 and that the maximum concurrence rapidly increases with the increasing of @xmath99 .",
    "for example , by doubling the experimental value of the two - qubit coupling ( @xmath95 ) , the maximum value of entanglement has a growth of @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "these results address the way such physical parameters can be tuned in order to substantially enhance the entanglement between @xmath1-@xmath2 qubits .",
    "in summary , we proposed a model based on the rtn , which mimics the 1/f@xmath0 noise , to describe the dissipative dynamics of two @xmath1-@xmath2 qubits in two dqds . by employing such a model , we were able to determine a suitable description of the experimental data shown in ref .",
    "[ ] . moreover , we studied the role of the preparation time and the two - qubit coupling in the dissipative dynamics .",
    "we showed that the two - qubit coupling plays a crucial role in the entanglement evolution and a small increase in @xmath25 can lead to a considerable amplification of the entanglement .",
    "such results can be used as a reference for further studies in quantum systems where the 1/f@xmath0 noise is present .",
