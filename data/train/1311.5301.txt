    "in the big data era , robust data analysis is becoming more important than before . nowadays , collecting a large dataset such as the data on the web is an easily task , while the quality of data may not be properly controlled . in such dataset ,",
    "contamination caused by outliers such as incorrectly measured , or mis - recorded samples will be inevitable . hence , robust statistical methods are demanded to extract valuable information from ubiquitous contaminated data .",
    "the concept of outliers is elusive , and it will be difficult to establish a reliable statistical model for outliers . hence , robust statistical methods are expected to automatically reduce the effect of outliers .",
    "robust statistics has a long history , and a lot of promising estimators were proposed .",
    "it is well known that the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) suffers from a detrimental effect from outliers .",
    "the mle can have a large bias even under a single erroneous observation .",
    "many robust estimators were developed to reduce the bias induced by outliers .",
    "the statistical properties of robust estimators were deeply investigated by developing useful concepts such as the influence function , gross - error sensitivity , break - down point , and so forth ; see @xcite for details .    a way to reduce the effect of outliers",
    "is to employ weighted estimators , in which weight is introduced on each training sample . in the estimation procedure ,",
    "the weight on the outlier is automatically reduced to make the estimator stable .",
    "the weighted estimators are regarded as an extension of the mle that has a constant weight .",
    "basu et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the robust estimator based on the density - power weight , and fujisawa and eguchi  @xcite introduced another type of weighting scheme to deal with heavily contaminated data .",
    "the weighted estimators are closely related to the scoring rules defined on the set of probability densities .",
    "the scoring rule is a quantity to assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts  @xcite .",
    "the mle corresponds to the kullback - leibler score , and the weighted estimators introduced in the above are derived from the density - power score or gamma - score . from the standpoint of scoring rules , a unified framework of weighted estimators",
    "is recently presented by kanamori and fujisawa  @xcite , in which a new class of scoring rule called hlder score was proposed .    in this paper ,",
    "our concern is to develop a new approach for robust data analysis based on scoring rules .",
    "usually , the scoring rule is defined as a functional on the set of probability densities . however , there are a lot of scoring rules that can be defined over a set of non - negative functions . exploiting such scoring rules ,",
    "we propose a simple way of estimating not only the parameter in the statistical model but also the contamination ratio of outliers .",
    "estimating the contamination ratio is important to detect outliers out of the training samples .",
    "indeed , one can identify the outliers by picking up the estimated number of training samples in ascending order of the estimated value of the target probability density .",
    "for this purpose , we use scoring rules with an enlarged extension of statistical models , that is called the enlarged models .",
    "we apply the proposed method to regression problems . for each independent variable @xmath0",
    ", the dependent variable @xmath1 may be contaminated . when the contamination ratio on @xmath1 does not depend on @xmath0 , i.e.",
    ", the situation of homogeneous contamination , the problem is almost the same as the robust estimation of the probability density . on the other hand , when the contamination ratio depends on @xmath0 , i.e. , the heterogeneous contamination , the situation is rather complex .",
    "we propose a simple method to obtain a robust regression estimator under heterogeneous contamination .",
    "in addition , our method provides the estimator of the contamination ratio to detect the outliers out of training samples . in our approach",
    ", a scoring rule is used with an enlarged location - scale models .",
    "we prove that our methods has a small bias even under complex heterogeneous contamination .",
    "moreover , we show that our estimator efficiently works even when both independent and dependent variables are heavily contaminated .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : scoringrules ] , we introduce some scoring rules for the statistical inference . in section  [ eqn : scale_models_heavy_contaminations ] , we propose statistical methods using enlarged models .",
    "we demonstrate how our estimator works to estimate not only the model parameter but also the contamination ratio . in section  [ sec : regression_problems ]",
    ", the proposed method is applied to regression problems .",
    "we show that our approach efficiently works even under heterogeneous contamination . to confirm the practical efficiency of our methods , we present some numerical experiments in section  [ sec : numerical_experiments ] . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we close this article with a discussion of the possibility of the newly introduced estimation methods .",
    "technical calculations and proofs are found in the appendix .",
    "let us summarize the notations to be used throughout the paper : let @xmath2 be the set of all real numbers , and @xmath3 denotes the @xmath4-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the univariate normal distribution with the mean @xmath5 and variance @xmath6 is denoted as @xmath7 , and the @xmath8-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with the mean vector @xmath5 and variance - covariance matrix @xmath9 is expressed as @xmath10 . for the function @xmath11 , the integral @xmath12",
    "is often denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "scoring rule is a class of discrepancy measures between two probability distributions , and it is widely used to statistical inference  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we briefly introduce some scoring rules : the density - power score , pseudo - spherical score , and hlder score , and show some statistical properties . the density - power score and pseudo - spherical score",
    "are used for robust parameter estimation .",
    "the hlder score is a class of extended scoring rules including these scoring rules .",
    "first of all , we briefly review the scoring rules .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be probability densities on the euclidean space @xmath16 , and @xmath17 be a real - valued function of the point @xmath18 and probability density @xmath19 . for the probability densities",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath19 , the scoring rule is a real - valued function @xmath21 expressed as @xmath22 the scoring rule is said to be _ proper _ , if the inequality @xmath23 holds for arbitrary probability densities @xmath20 and @xmath19 as long as the integral exists .",
    "moreover , if the equality @xmath24 leads to @xmath25 almost surely , @xmath21 is called the _",
    "strictly _ proper scoring rule .",
    "the strictly proper scoring rule @xmath21 defines the divergence @xmath26 , that is an extension of squared distance measures on the space of probability densities .",
    "one of the most popular strictly proper scoring rules is the kullback - leibler ( kl ) score , that is defined from @xmath27 .",
    "the divergence associated with the kl score is nothing but the kl divergence .",
    "we can use strictly proper scoring rules for statistical inference .",
    "let @xmath28 be a parametrized probability density by the parameter @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is a member of an open subset @xmath30 in @xmath31 . when the i.i.d .",
    "samples @xmath32 are observed from the probability density @xmath20 , the statistical model @xmath33 is used to estimate the density @xmath20 based on the samples .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 is realized by a probability density in the model .",
    "then , the minimization of the empirical loss , @xmath34 is expected to provide a good estimate of the probability density @xmath20 .",
    "this is because the empirical mean converges in probability to the score @xmath35 , that is minimized at @xmath36 .",
    "let us introduce two strictly proper scoring rules ; one is the density - power score @xmath37 and the other is the pseudo - spherical score @xmath38 .",
    "both scores have a positive real parameter @xmath39 . given @xmath40 , the density - power score is defined as @xmath41 and the associated loss function is given as @xmath42 see  @xcite for details of the density - power score and its applications .",
    "on the other hand , the pseudo - spherical score  @xcite is defined as @xmath43 that is derived from the loss function , @xmath44 the hlder s inequality assures that the pseudo - spherical score is the strictly proper scoring rule the monotone transformation @xmath45 is called gamma cross entropy .",
    "the statistical property of the estimator based on gamma cross entropy was investigated in  @xcite . as the parameter @xmath39 tends to zero ,",
    "the estimator derived from the density - power score or pseudo - spherical score gets close to the mle ; see @xcite for details .",
    "for some scoring rules , their domain can be extended to a set of non - negative functions .",
    "indeed , one can confirm that for non - negative and non - zero functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the inequalities @xmath48 and @xmath49 hold .",
    "for the density - power score , the equality @xmath50 for non - negative functions leads to @xmath51 . for the pseudo - spherical score",
    ", however , the equality @xmath52 holds if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are linearly dependent .",
    "note that the linearly dependent probability densities should be identical .",
    "hence , the pseudo - spherical score is strictly proper on the set of probability densities , while it is not strictly proper on the set of non - negative functions . for the reader s",
    "convenience , we give a self - contained short proof of the above facts in appendix  [ appendix : preliminaries ] .",
    "let us introduce the robustness property of estimators based on the above scoring rules .",
    "suppose that our target is to estimate the probability density @xmath53 from the observed samples .",
    "we use the parametric statistical model @xmath54 for the estimation of the target density @xmath53 . assume that @xmath55 holds for @xmath56 , i.e. , the target is realized by the model .",
    "let @xmath57 be a probability density of contamination .",
    "suppose that the observations @xmath32 are drawn from the contaminated probability density , @xmath58 in which @xmath59 is the contamination ratio that typically lies in the interval @xmath60 .",
    "here , we do not assume that @xmath59 is infinitesimal , i.e. , we deal with the situation of heavy contamination .",
    "instead , we assume that for a positive constant @xmath39 , the quantity @xmath61 is sufficiently small around @xmath62 .",
    "this assumption indicates that the contamination density @xmath57 mostly lies on the tail of the target density @xmath53 .",
    "let us consider the estimation of the target density under heavy contamination .",
    "the empirical probability density is denoted as @xmath63 , that is expressed by the sum of dirac s delta function .",
    "the empirical pseudo - spherical score on the model , @xmath64 , converges in probability to @xmath65 , and we have @xmath66 since @xmath67 is assumed to be sufficiently small around @xmath62 , the optimal solution of @xmath68 will be close to that of @xmath69 . hence , even under heavy contamination , the pseudo - spherical score produces approximately consistent estimator of the target density @xmath70 .",
    "the argument above was presented in  @xcite .    for the density - power score",
    ", the same argument does not hold .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath71 even if @xmath67 is exactly zero , the minimizer of @xmath72 will not be equal to @xmath62 .",
    "hence , the density - power score does not produce the approximately consistent estimator under heavy contamination .      as an extension of the scoring rules , kanamori and fujisawa proposed the hlder score that is derived from the invariance under data transformations  @xcite .",
    "the hlder score includes the density - power score and pseudo - spherical score as special cases .",
    "let us define the hlder score .",
    "for a real - valued function @xmath73 defined for @xmath74 , suppose that @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath39 is a positive real constant .",
    "given @xmath40 , the hlder score @xmath77 based on the function @xmath78 is defined as @xmath79 for the non - negative functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the hlder inequality assures that @xmath80 holds , and the equality @xmath81 leads to the linear dependence of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "more involved argument yields that for probability densities @xmath20 and @xmath19 , the equality @xmath82 leads to @xmath25 ; see  @xcite for details .",
    "we give a self - contained short proof of the above facts in appendix  [ appendix : preliminaries ] .",
    "generally , the hlder score @xmath83 for the probability densities @xmath20 and @xmath19 is not expressed as the expectation with respect to @xmath20 . however , one can substitute the empirical distribution of training samples into  @xmath20 , since @xmath83 depends on @xmath20 through the integral @xmath84 .",
    "the hlder score with @xmath85 is reduced to the density - power score , and the lower bound @xmath86 yields that @xmath87 .",
    "the hlder score is derived from the invariance property of the data transformation .",
    "suppose that the probability density @xmath14 is transformed to @xmath88 , when the data @xmath0 is changed to @xmath89 by an affine transformation .",
    "then , the divergence @xmath90 is converted into @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a positive constant depending only on the affine transformation of data .",
    "this implies that the data transformation does not essentially change the distance structure on the set of probability densities .",
    "in addition , the affine invariance implies that the estimator defined from the hlder score is equivariant  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the estimator does not essentially depend on the choice of the system of units in the measurement .",
    "this is a desirable property for statistical data analysis .",
    "detecting outliers out of training samples is an important task in data analysis . to deal with this issue",
    ", we introduce estimators of the contamination ratio based on scoring rules with enlarged models .",
    "we present some theoretical properties of the proposed estimators .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the estimator based on the pseudo - spherical score produces an approximately consistent estimator of the target density even under heavy contamination .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath93 in the contaminated distribution is not estimated . estimating the contamination ratio @xmath59 is available to detect outliers out of the training samples . using the estimated contamination ratio",
    ", one can identify the outliers out of the training samples by picking up the estimated number of training samples in ascending order of the estimated value of the target probability density .",
    "this is because the outliers are assumed to mostly lie on the tail of the underlying target density .    in order to estimate not only the target density but also the contamination ratio , we use the _ enlarged model _",
    "@xmath94 defined as @xmath95 where @xmath28 is a parametrized probability density and @xmath96 is a one - dimensional positive real parameter to estimate the ratio @xmath93 .",
    "let us consider the estimator based on the density - power score with the enlarged model .",
    "suppose that the samples are drawn from the contaminated probability density , and that @xmath97 holds .",
    "in the same way as , we have @xmath98 for the enlarged model @xmath99 . if @xmath67 is sufficiently small around @xmath62 , the optimal solution of the problem @xmath100 will be close to that of the problem @xmath101 .",
    "remember that the density - power score is strictly proper on the set of non - negative functions .",
    "therefore , the density - power score with the enlarged model enables us to estimate both the target density @xmath102 and the ratio @xmath93 . on the other hand ,",
    "the argument in the above is not valid for the pseudo - spherical score , because @xmath103 holds for all @xmath104 .",
    "hlder scores with some regularity conditions are also available to estimate the target density and contamination ratio .",
    "indeed , when @xmath67 is sufficiently small around @xmath62 , the hlder score defined from a smooth function @xmath78 satisfies @xmath105 suppose that the hlder score is strictly proper on the set of non - negative functions .",
