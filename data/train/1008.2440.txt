    "first , though , we take a digression to discuss products of palindromes .",
    "in this section we find a new connection between the prime palstars ( as introduced in knuth , morris , and pratt ) and the unbordered words .",
    "we start with some definitions .",
    "by @xmath9 we mean the reverse of the word @xmath10 .",
    "palindrome _ is a word @xmath10 such that @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we will only be concerned with the nonempty palindromes of even length :    @xmath12    a _ palstar _ is an element of the language @xmath13 .",
    "a word @xmath14 is a _ prime palstar _ if it is a palstar and can not be written as the product of two palstars .",
    "evidently a prime palstar must itself be a palindrome .",
    "the first few prime palstars over @xmath15 are @xmath16 and their complements , obtained by mapping @xmath17 to @xmath18 and vice versa .",
    "the language of all prime palstars is denoted primepalstar .",
    "every palstar has a unique factorization into prime palstars .",
    "the proof of this theorem depends on the following lemma :    no prime palstar is a proper prefix of another prime palstar .",
    "[ pal ]    if @xmath10 is a palindrome of even length , then its factorization into prime palstars must be of the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "[ palin ]    suppose @xmath22 is the factorization into prime palstars @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath24 we are done . otherwise , since @xmath10 ends with @xmath25 , it must begin with @xmath26 .",
    "hence either @xmath27 is a prefix of @xmath25 , or vice versa . by lemma  [ pal ]",
    "we must have @xmath28 .",
    "using the same argument on the shorter palindrome @xmath29 , we derive the remaining equalities .",
    "we now turn to borders .",
    "a word is said to be _ bordered _ if it has some nonempty prefix that is also a suffix .",
    "otherwise , it is _",
    "unbordered_. unbordered words are also called _ bifix - free _ in the literature @xcite .",
    "equivalently , a word @xmath10 is bordered if it can be written in the form @xmath30 for some nonempty word @xmath14 .",
    "for example , entanglement begins and ends with the string ent .    given two words of the same length @xmath31 and @xmath32 , their _ perfect shuffle _",
    "@xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 .",
    "a word @xmath10 is a prime palstar if and only if there exists an unbordered word @xmath35 such that @xmath36 . [ palstar - thm ]    suppose @xmath10 is not a prime palstar .",
    "if @xmath10 is not an even length palindrome then it is certainly not of the form @xmath37 .",
    "suppose then that @xmath10 is an even length palindrome and hence is of the form @xmath38 .",
    "we will show that @xmath35 is bordered . since @xmath10 is not a prime palstar we can factor @xmath10 into a product of prime palstars .",
    "then by corollary  [ palin ] such a factorization must look like @xmath39 for some palindrome @xmath14 .",
    "then when we  unshuffle \" @xmath10 into @xmath35 and @xmath40 , we get that @xmath35 starts with the odd - indexed letters of @xmath14 and ends with the odd - indexed letters of @xmath41 .",
    "but @xmath42 , so @xmath35 starts and ends with the same word .",
    "on the other hand , suppose @xmath43 . by comparing the symbols @xmath14 to @xmath44",
    "we see that if @xmath45 , then @xmath10 is not a palindrome .",
    "so assume @xmath46 .",
    "now if @xmath14 is bordered , then we can write it as @xmath47 for some nonempty string @xmath35 . then @xmath48 .",
    "this gives a factorization of @xmath10 as a product of two or three nonempty palstars ( according to whether @xmath49 is empty or nonempty ) .",
    "an example of this theorem in english is @xmath50 , which is a prime palstar , and is the shuffle of the unbordered word @xmath51 with its reversal .",
    "as far as we know , up to now no one has enumerated the palstars . however , our argument above allows us to do so , based on enumeration of the unbordered words .",
    "nielsen @xcite has shown that if @xmath52 denotes the number of unbordered words of length @xmath53 over an alphabet of size @xmath54 , then @xmath55 ( also see @xcite . )",
    "furthermore , he showed that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a constant that tends to @xmath18 as @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath60 is the number of prime palstars of length @xmath61 , then @xmath62 . in particular , about 27% of all binary palindromes are prime palstars .",
    "we now apply the results in section  [ palstar ] to prove that the class of context - free languages is not closed under inverse star .",
    "assume it is .",
    "without loss of generality the alphabet is @xmath68 .",
    "consider @xmath69 the intersection of @xmath66 with a regular language .",
    "then @xmath70 since the context - free languages are closed under intersection with a regular language , it suffices to prove @xmath71 is not context - free .    to do this",
    ", we use ogden s lemma @xcite . choose @xmath72 and distinguish the third block of @xmath17 s , the one corresponding to @xmath73 .",
    "write @xmath74 .",
    "then by ogden s lemma @xmath75 must contain at most @xmath53 distinguished positions and @xmath76 at least one .",
    "if @xmath76 contains a @xmath18 , then by pumping we get a string with too many @xmath18 s .",
    "thus @xmath76 contains @xmath17 s only , and each of @xmath77 , @xmath14 is contained in a single block of zeros .",
    "case 2 : @xmath77 contains @xmath17 s from block @xmath81 , and @xmath14 contains @xmath17 s from block @xmath73 .",
    "then consider @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "then this string has @xmath84 , @xmath85 , a contradiction .",
    "consider the morphisms @xmath89 and @xmath90 defined as follows : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "then the effect of @xmath97 is to extract the odd - indexed letters from an even - length word .",
    "assume that @xmath65 is context - free",
    ". then @xmath98 would be context - free .",
