    "virtual knots were introduced by kauffman @xcite as a generalization of classical knot theory , and since then many invariants have been developed to help distinguish virtual knots , and to determine when a virtual knot is equivalent to a classical knot . in the past few years",
    ", several authors have developed invariants that generalize the classical _ writhe _ of a knot @xcite .",
    "these invariants have been used to define vassiliev invariants of virtual knots @xcite , give bounds on the unknotting number ( when it exists ) and forbidden number of virtual knots @xcite , and distinguish mutant virtual knots @xcite , among other applications .",
    "these invariants can be unified in a single polynomial invariant , variously called the writhe polynomial @xcite , the affine index polynomial @xcite and the wriggle polynomial @xcite . we will refer to it as the _ writhe polynomial_.    other authors have extended the classical alexander polynomials to virtual knots @xcite . as for knots , there is a sequence of alexander polynomials @xmath1 for virtual knots , with each polynomial defined modulo the lower - order polynomials . for classical knots",
    "the lowest - order invariant @xmath0 is always trivial , so the most interesting polynomial in the sequence is @xmath2 ; for virtual knots , however , @xmath0 is generally not trivial , and it has many applications . in this paper we will provide a new way to look at the polynomial @xmath0 , and use this new interpretation to show that the writhe polynomial can be obtained from the alexander polynomial .    in section [ s : virtual ]",
    "we will review the definitions of virtual knots and gauss diagrams , and define the index of a crossing . in section [ s : alexander ]",
    "we define the alexander polynomial @xmath3 and give a new interpretation using indices . in section [ s : writhe ]",
    "we define the writhe polynomial @xmath4 , and show how it is determined by the alexander polynomial .",
    "in section [ s:2writhe ] we extend these ideas to define a  second - order \" writhe polynomial @xmath5 .",
    "finally , in section [ s : applications ] we present some applications of our results .",
    "we end with an appendix listing the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for all virtual knots with at most 4 crossings .",
    "our approach to virtual knots will be combinatorial .",
    "kauffman @xcite showed that virtual knots can be defined as equivalence classes of diagrams modulo certain moves , generalizing the reidemeister moves of classical knot theory .",
    "diagrams for virtual knots contain both classical crossings ( positive and/or negative crossings , if the knot is oriented ) and _ virtual _ crossings , as shown in figure [ f : crossings ] .",
    "two diagrams are equivalent if they are related by a sequence of the reidemeister moves shown in figure [ f : reidemeister ] .",
    "note that moves ( i)(iii ) are the classical reidemeister moves .",
    "kauffman @xcite showed that classical knots are equivalent by this expanded set of reidemeister moves if and only if they are equivalent by the classical reidemeister moves , so classical knot theory embeds inside virtual knot theory .",
    "one motivation for virtual knots comes from _ gauss codes _ and _ gauss diagrams_. any oriented classical knot can be represented by its gauss code .",
    "we first choose a labeling of the crossings , from 1 to @xmath6 .",
    "the gauss code is found by selecting a point on the knot , and then making a complete circuit along the knot until we return to this point . whenever we pass a crossing , we write down a triple indicating whether it is an over or under - crossing ( o or u )",
    ", the number of the crossing , and the sign of the crossing ( so each crossing appears twice in the code , once as an over - crossing and once as an under - crossing ) .",
    "we can represent this code visually using a gauss diagram .",
    "the gauss diagram is an oriented circle with @xmath7 points marked along the boundary , corresponding to the @xmath7 triples in the gauss code .",
    "we connect the pair of points corresponding to each crossing with a chord directed from the over - crossing to the under - crossing , and label the chord with the sign of the crossing .",
    "for example , figure [ f : gaussex ] shows the knot diagram and gauss diagram for the knot with gauss code u1-o2+u3+o1-o3+u2 + .    however , it is easy to write down plausible gauss codes ( i.e. each crossing appears in two triples , with the same sign , once with o and once with u ) which do not come from classical knots ; these codes , and the associated gauss diagrams , correspond to virtual knots ( where the virtual crossings are ignored in the gauss code ) .",
    "kauffman @xcite showed that the correspondence between gauss diagrams ( modulo equivalents of the classical reidemeister moves ) and virtual knots ( modulo the classical and virtual reidemeister moves ) is a bijection .",
    "we will assign several _ indices _ to the chords of a gauss diagram .",
    "first , we label the endpoint of each chord with a sign .",
    "let @xmath8 be a chord in gauss diagram @xmath9 , oriented from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , with sign @xmath12 .",
    "we label point @xmath10 ( the over - crossing ) with sign @xmath13 and point @xmath11 ( the under - crossing ) with @xmath12 .",
    "now let @xmath14 be the arc of the bounding circle from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and @xmath15 be the arc of the bounding circle from @xmath11 to @xmath10 ( both following the orientation of the circle ) .",
    "so @xmath14 is the part of the bounding circle to the right of @xmath16 , and @xmath15 is the part of the bounding circle to the left of @xmath16 .",
    "* the _ right over - index _ of @xmath16 , denoted @xmath17 , is the sum of the signs of the over - crossing points on arc @xmath14 .",
    "* the _ right under - index _ of @xmath16 , denoted @xmath18 , is the sum of the signs of the under - crossing points on arc @xmath14 . *",
    "the _ left over - index _ of @xmath16 , denoted @xmath19 , is the sum of the signs of the over - crossing points on arc @xmath15 . *",
    "the _ left under - index _ of @xmath16 , denoted @xmath20 , is the sum of the signs of the under - crossing points on arc @xmath15 .",
    "* the _ index _ of @xmath16 is @xmath21 , i.e. the sum of all signs on arc @xmath15 ."
