    "with the advent of high - resolution x - ray telescopes it is now routine to see structure in x - ray images . assessing the level at which one should believe this structure presents more of a challenge in x - ray observations than in optical or radio images of comparable resolution , because x - ray data are very often photon - noise limited .",
    "the problem is made worse by the common ( and necessary ) practice of smoothing the data with a gaussian .",
    "this is carried out in order to make the images conform to our expectations of what the ` true ' sky image with infinite exposure time would look like ; but it is important to remember that in general it does _ not _ in fact take away the photon - limited nature of the underlying data .",
    "a number of smoothed x - ray images of extragalactic objects appear , on published contour maps , to show quite clear ` filamentary ' connections between x - ray sources in the field .",
    "( the term ` filament ' does not have a single definition in the literature ; i shall use it to mean any extended , apparently linear connection between two sources . ) in this paper i discuss the techniques necessary to determine whether such filamentary connections are real , and apply them to some sample observations of galaxies and quasars , previously analysed by other authors ( arp 1996 , dahlem et al .",
    "1996 , arp 1997 ) , which i have taken from the _ rosat _ archives .",
    "the first problem in assessing the reality of features in smoothed x - ray maps is that of the significance levels to be chosen when contouring . if the mean background count density is @xmath0 counts per unit area and the convolving gaussian has the form throughout the paper to denote the width of a convolving gaussian , and @xmath1 to refer to the conventional significance levels . ]",
    "@xmath2 , then , as pointed out in appendix a of hardcastle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the background noise is _ not _ normally distributed unless @xmath3 , a condition which does not typically apply in the sort of datasets being considered here .",
    "it is therefore incorrect , for example , to take the r.m.s .",
    "dispersion of the background noise after smoothing , multiply by three , add the mean and call the resulting contour level ` @xmath4 ' as though it were the corresponding confidence level for normally - distributed noise .",
    "in general it is not .",
    "contours for noise which is not normally distributed should ideally have the same properties as those for normally distributed noise , so that the contour referred to as the ` @xmath4 ' contour , for example , should exclude all but 0.135% of the background .",
    "but in the case where @xmath5 , there is no analytic solution to the question ` what is the contour level corresponding to the @xmath6 level for normally distributed noise , for some @xmath7 ? ' .",
    "instead , hardcastle et al .  ( 1998 ) outline a monte carlo procedure for determining the correct significance level . in this procedure",
    ", fields of simulated poisson noise are convolved with a gaussian and the ` @xmath6 ' level is derived directly from the distribution of the resulting noise .",
    "( results of this process for some sample values of @xmath0 and @xmath8 are plotted in fig .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath3 , then the noise will be approximately normally distributed and a simple analysis , described in hardcastle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , shows that the @xmath4 contour should be at @xmath9 counts per unit area .",
    "it is common for authors not to state the method by which the ` @xmath4 ' ( or other ) levels in published contour plots of smoothed x - ray images were derived ; in some cases , even the size of the convolving gaussian and/or the binning scheme is not given .",
    "this practice makes it very difficult to assess the reality of features in such plots , and it is recommended that in all cases where the noise is not , or might not be , normally distributed authors should explain what they mean by ` @xmath4 ' . in what follows , wherever i refer to a @xmath10 or @xmath4 level calculated by me , it will imply that i have derived it from simulated poisson noise as described above .",
    "however , even when the @xmath4 level is correctly defined , such that a contour at this level would exclude all but 0.135% of the gaussian - smoothed background noise , it is unfortunately not necessarily the case that we can say that all ` structure ' around a bright source enclosed by such a contour is detected at a corresponding significance level .",
    "the radially averaged point - spread function ( psf ) of x - ray instruments often has a very broad tail , so that there are expected to be significant count densities at large distances from the centroid ; the shape of the psf can be energy - dependent , so that these off - centre counts are likely to have a peculiar spectrum compared to either the point source itself or the background .",
    "when two point sources are placed close to each other , the natural consequence of this feature of the psf is that we get an enhancement of the count rate which is at its greatest directly between them . smoothing the data with a gaussian may well bring this feature up above the noise , giving the appearance of a filament connecting the sources .",
    "so to assess the reality of filaments observed at a given contour level in smoothed images we must ask what is the probability of seeing such filaments under the null hypothesis , which is that the two sources are in fact not connected by any real feature on the x - ray sky . in general this too must be done by monte carlo simulation .",
    "i have written code which generates a poisson - distributed noise background and two or more simulated sources , convolved with a suitable psf , which match those seen on the sky .",
    "the simulated data are then smoothed with a gaussian , and then either automatically or by eye it is possible to see whether a ` filament ' at a given contour level joins them ( in practice , the code does this using a simple recursive flood - fill algorithm ) . by repeating this procedure many times , we can directly estimate the probability that an observed filament would be seen under the null hypothesis , and so characterise its statistical significance .",
    "only connections which have a very small chance of being seen under the null hypothesis can be described as statistically significant .",
    "an example of the kinds of apparent filaments that can result from low choices of contour levels even under the null hypothesis is given in fig .",

    "it is simple to simulate pspc observations .",
    "one complication is that the psf is both energy - dependent and dependent on the off - axis angle of the source .",
    "dealing with the energy dependence of the psf is not hard , but would involve generating an energy - weighted psf for each source . for simplicity ,",
    "i choose to use the psf at a single energy , in most cases 1 kev ( the energy at which _ rosat _ is most sensitive ) ; this is a conservative choice , in the sense that the psf is narrowest at approximately this energy .",

    "the seyfert is a very strong x - ray source , while the point x - ray source identified by arp with the quasar , located 170 arcsec to the nw , is only weakly detected in the pspc observations .",
    "arp ( 1996 ) analysed the 0.5 - 2.0 kev pspc data , and saw a filament connecting the seyfert and quasar .",
    "it is not clear what binning scheme and smoothing gaussian was used to produce his figures 1 and 2 , but i obtain very similar results by binning by a factor 7 ( so that each pixel is 3.5 arcsec ) and smoothing with a gaussian of @xmath14 pixels ( 14 arcsec ) .",
    "the results are insensitive to the exact values of binning and smoothing used .",
    "the mean number of background counts in the image per 3.5-arcsec pixel , close to the central source and after excluding all visible background sources is 0.0135 , which , using the techniques described in section [ significance ] , corresponds to @xmath15- and @xmath4 levels in the smoothed dataset of 0.032 and 0.044 counts pixel@xmath16 respectively .",

    "[ mrk474 ] , the connecting ` filament ' is not represented except at the @xmath10 level when the confidence limits are calculated correctly .",
    "moreover , when i simulated this situation ( using 30 net counts for the quasar , as measured by arp ( 1996 ) , and 6700 net counts for the seyfert galaxy ) , i found that we expect to see a connection between the two sources at the @xmath10 level 65% of the time , and even at the @xmath4 level 30% of the time , if the two sources are in fact just adjacent point sources , because of the increased count density close to mrk 474 .",

    "( @xmath19 ) .",
    "in this case the quasar is a reasonably strong x - ray source , while the galaxy shows some weaker extended emission .",
    "hardcastle & worrall ( 1999 ) found the pspc emission from the quasar to be consistent with that of a point source , although the hri observations of the source suggest some extension on small scales , consistent with emission from a cluster ( hardcastle & worrall 1999 , crawford et al .",
    "ngc 4651 has an optical jet or tail ; arp ( 1996 ) views this as evidence for ejection , while wehrle , keel & jones ( 1997 ) suggest that the optical colours are evidence for a tidal origin .",
    "binning and smoothing the 0.1 - 2.0 kev energy band with the same parameters as i used for mrk 474 , and with a measured mean background count level of 0.0534 counts pixel@xmath16 , the elongation of ngc 4651 in the direction of 3c275.1 is clearly visible .",
    "the @xmath4 contour after smoothing is at about 0.110 counts pixel@xmath16 , and the elongation is seen at this level [ corresponding to a level somewhere between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 contours in figure 7 of arp ( 1996 ) ] . taking the quasar as containing about 200 counts in the 0.1 - 2.0 kev energy band , and the galaxy as containing 120",
    ", i used simulations to determine whether , if the galaxy were really a point source , the effect of the quasar s proximity could cause the observed extension ; as expected from the images and from the comparative weakness of the quasar , the probability of obtaining such a strong result by chance is negligible .",
    "we can safely conclude that the extension of ngc 4651 is likely to be real . however , there is no evidence for a compact jet - like structure in ngc 4651 in the hri image .",
    "the radio - loud quasar 3c232",
    "( @xmath22 ) is adjacent to the starburst galaxy ngc 3067 . in this case , too , the effect of contamination by the quasar s psf is small and the elongation seen by arp ( 1996 ) in the 0.72.0 kev x - ray emission of ngc 3067 appears real ; simulation shows that this degree of extension in the smoothed image is too great to be produced by chance , particularly as it is not directed towards the quasar ( which is what we would expect for an artefact of the sort discussed in section [ psf ] ) .",
    "arp ( 1996 ) also reports filaments in smoothed 0.1 - 2.0 kev images connecting 3c232 to stellar objects to the north and northeast .",
    "arp binned the data here in 5-arcsec pixels and smoothed with a small gaussian of @xmath23 pixels .",
    "the background noise level per 5-arcsec pixel in this energy band is 0.068 counts ; the corresponding @xmath4 level is 0.15 counts pixel@xmath16 , whereas arp s lowest contour appears to have been at 0.11 counts pixel@xmath16 , somewhat below the @xmath10 level .",
    "simulation shows that we would not expect a filament even at this level connecting 3c232 with the northern stellar object by chance under the null hypothesis , which suggests that there is some real emission in between 3c232 and the northern stellar object , but the data provide no significant evidence for such a filament rather than , for example , an intervening point source .",
    "arp ( 1996 ) observed the x - ray bright @xmath24 seyfert galaxy mrk 205 with the _ rosat _ hri .",
    "the seyfert lies 44 arcsec south of the galaxy ngc 4319 , which was not detected in the hri observations ; but a number of other sources are detected in the field , including the early - type galaxy ngc 4291 , 6.4 arcmin away to the ne , which is extended in the x - ray .",
    "three of the brightest of these sources , at off - axis distances from 8 to 15 arcmin , are identified with intermediate - to - high redshift quasars .",
    "in addition to arp s data , a deeper exposure centred on ngc 4291 exists in the archive ; this shows similar detections .",
    "having adaptively smoothed his dataset ( this process involves smoothing the pixels containing small numbers of photons with larger gaussians than those containing larger numbers , and then summing the results ) arp obtained the ` startling ' result that many  indeed , almost all  of the point sources were joined to the central source , mrk 205 , by ` filaments ' of x - ray emission .",
    "i began to investigate this field by analysing the data in a similar way to the other sources .",
    "adopting arp s binning scheme of 8-arcsec pixels , the mean number of background counts per pixel @xmath0 is then about 1.08 .",
    "i smoothed the whole image with a gaussian of 16 pixel fwhm , or @xmath25 pixels ; the corresponding @xmath4 level is 1.21 counts pixel@xmath16 .",
    "( this result was derived from numerical simulation , but since @xmath26 in this case , the background noise is close to being normally distributed , and the analytic approximation described in section [ significance ] in fact applies and gives the same answer . ) at this level , or even at the corresponding @xmath10 level , no filaments connected any of the sources . only at the @xmath27 contour level",
    "did the filamentary structure seen in arp s figure 10 begin to become apparent .",
    "however , arp s use of adaptive smoothing is intended to improve the visibility of low - surface - brightness features .",
    "the characteristics of poisson noise smoothed in this way are even less clear than for the single - gaussian case , but the question may still be answered by monte carlo simulation as discussed in section [ significance ] .",
    "arp s description of his binning scheme is somewhat ambiguous , but i obtained a reasonable match to the image in his figure 10 by smoothing the 8-arcsec pixels containing one count with a gaussian of @xmath8 ( not fwhm ) of 16 pixels , pixels with two counts with a gaussian of @xmath28 pixels , and so on ( @xmath29 pixels , where @xmath7 is the number of counts ) up to pixels with more than 12 counts , which were not smoothed .",
    "i then simulated the effects of smoothing poisson - distributed noise with @xmath30 counts pixel@xmath16 with this adaptive filter .",
    "the resulting @xmath4-equivalent level ( 1.29 counts pixel@xmath16 ) is , as expected , higher for this smoothing method than for the case where the whole field is smoothed with the largest gaussian ( on the analytic approximation , this would be 1.13 counts pixel@xmath16 ) , both because the ` average ' smoothing gaussian is smaller and because the method accentuates the difference between bright and faint noise pixels . as shown in fig .",
    "[ mrk205 ] , when contoured at this level my adaptively smoothed image shows no significant filaments ; a much lower level of contouring is required to show up the structures in arp s figure 10 .",
    "in fact , it appears from the caption from arp s figure 11a that his ` @xmath4 ' level is 1.08 counts pixel@xmath16 , which is similar to the _ expected number _ of counts per pixel ( unchanged , of course , as a result of smoothing ) .",
    "it is therefore not at all surprising that contouring at this level shows connections between adjacent sources ; since the median for these data is close to the mean , this contour level corresponds to contouring about half the area of the map ( preferentially the central regions , because of the effects of vignetting on the external component of the x - ray background ) . simulating adaptive smoothing of the hri field of view , neglecting vignetting",
    ", i find that we expect to see a connection at this level between the central source and the northernmost point source ( identified with a @xmath31 quasar ) approximately 25% of the time under the null hypothesis ; the filaments in arp ( 1996 ) are therefore not statistically significant .",
    "they are similarly undetected on the deeper hri image centred on ngc 4291 ( where the @xmath4 level of the adaptively smoothed image is lower as a fraction of @xmath0 because of the higher number of background counts per pixel ) .",
    "the starburst galaxy ngc 3628 was observed by dahlem et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and shows a striking filamentary structure , extending south from the galactic nucleus to a point source 2.7 arcmin away , in images in the 0.75 kev band ( 0.441.21 kev ) and 1.5 kev band ( 0.732.04 kev ) ; this point source itself appears connected to another point source a short distance to the se , which flesch & arp ( 1999 ) identify with a @xmath32 quasar .",
    "the contour levels selected by dahlem et al .  correspond quite well to the @xmath4 levels derived from simulation ; after master veto rate filtering to match theirs and binning in 15-arcsec pixels i find a background count rate away from ngc 3628 in the 0.75-kev band of 0.23 counts pixel@xmath16 , corresponding to a @xmath4 level of 0.73 counts pixel@xmath16 , which is actually below their adopted @xmath33 level .",
    "the filament is thus apparent in contours at better than the @xmath4 level .",
    "simulation ( using a psf appropriate for an energy of 0.75 kev ) shows that the connection between the two adjacent point sources is not significant , but that a connection at the observed level between ngc 3628 and the source to the s is not expected to occur by chance .",
    "however , this does not take account of the extended x - ray halo found by dahlem et al .",
    "( 1996 ) around ngc 3628 ( and clearly visible as excess emission in their figure 2 ) .",
    "if we model this crudely as an extra uniform contribution to the background  taking the average in a region between ngc 3628 and the southern source , the background is pushed up to @xmath34 counts pixel@xmath16  then the connection between ngc 3628 and the point source can occur by chance in a few per cent of cases , so the feature is only marginally significant .",
    "again , the filamentary emission is not seen in the hri image , which supports the notion that we are seeing a region of extended emission rather than a true x - ray jet ; but it will clearly be of great interest to obtain more sensitive images of this field . at the time of writing , a scheduled short _",

    "arp binned the hri data into 10-arcsec ( 20-pixel ) square bins ; the off - source background is then 1.21 counts pixel@xmath16 . it is not clear what arp means when he says that he smoothed the data with a ` @xmath18 gaussian ' ; a @xmath36 arcsec gaussian is very small given this binning scheme while a @xmath36 pixel gaussian is very large , causing the two sources to overlap .",
