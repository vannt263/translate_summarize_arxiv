    "large scale structures are thought to have formed by gravitational amplification of small perturbations @xcite .",
    "galaxies are believed to form when gas in highly over dense haloes cools and collapses to form stars in large numbers @xcite .",
    "evolution of density perturbations due to gravitational interaction in a cosmological setting is , therefore , the key process for the study of galaxy clustering and its evolution .",
    "it is also one of the most important processes in formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the basic equations for evolution of density perturbations are well known and are easy to solve when the amplitude of perturbations is small .",
    "once the amplitude of perturbations at relevant scales becomes large , the perturbation becomes non - linear and the coupling with perturbations at other scales can not be ignored . the equation for evolution of density perturbations can not be solved for generic perturbations in the non - linear regime .",
    "one can use quasi - linear approximations for studying mildly non - linear perturbations . statistical approximations and scaling relations can be used if a limited amount of information is sufficient @xcite . in general , however , we require cosmological n - body simulations to follow the detailed evolution of the system .",
    "the initial density distribution is often assumed to be a gaussian random field @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum or the two point correlation function is sufficient for describing such a field .",
    "gravitational clustering leads to departures from a strictly gaussian field and we need to specify the full hierarchy of @xmath0-point correlation functions in order to provide a complete description of the density field at late times @xcite . the distribution of matter represented by galaxies , etc . is strongly non - gaussian at small scales and",
    "hence it is necessary to measure higher order moments of the galaxy distribution , if not the full probability distribution function .",
    "redshift surveys give us information about the distribution of galaxies in redshift space . for a given galaxy ,",
    "the redshift is a combination of information about the radial distance and the radial component of the peculiar velocity .",
    "although it is possible to construct distribution of galaxies in real space at large scales , the techniques used are not suitable for recovering information at small scales .",
    "therefore we are confined to studying the galaxy distribution in redshift space at small scales , and hence it is important to understand the effect of redshift space distortions on the distribution of galaxies .",
    "it is well known that galaxies do not trace the matter distribution , i.e. , the galaxy distribution is biased .",
    "this is reflected in the clustering properties of galaxies which should differ from the clustering of matter , e.g. , the correlation function and the reduced moments are expected to be different for galaxies .",
    "it is known that highly over dense regions cluster much more strongly than the overall distribution of matter , and the peak picture provides a natural explanation for this @xcite .",
    "this can explain the large two point correlation function of galaxies at high redshifts , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "it can be combined with other inputs to develop an understanding of the evolution of galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "the clustering of galaxies depends on the environment , galaxy type and other factors that are relevant for galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is difficult to codify the physics of galaxy formation in simple terms and hence these aspects are modelled in terms of a stochastic bias @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the counts in cells using n - body simulations .",
    "we model the probability distribution function in redshift space using the halo model .",
    "we also study the effect of bias on moments of counts in cells , both in real and redshift space .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we review some basics of gravitational clustering in  2 . in ",
    "3 we discuss the simulations used in this work and also present the key results .",
    "we conclude with a discussion (  4 ) .",
    "the evolution of density perturbations can be studied in the newtonian limit at sufficiently small scales for non - relativistic matter .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the newtonian analysis gives the correct solution up to at least the third order for cold dark matter models even when a finite cosmological constant is present @xcite .",
    "thus the newtonian limit can be used with confidence at scales sufficiently smaller than the hubble radius .",
    "evolution of perturbations can then be described by the following equations . @xmath1",
    "it is assumed that the density field is generated by a distribution of particles , each of mass @xmath2 and comoving position @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the present value of hubble constant , @xmath5 is the present density parameter for non - relativistic matter and @xmath6 is the scale factor .",
    "density contrast @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the average density .",
    "it is clear from these equations that over dense regions @xmath9 grow by pulling in matter from surrounding regions while under dense regions @xmath10 become more under dense and start to occupy larger volume .",
    "it can be shown that gravitational instability leads to formation of highly dense haloes that are in virial equilibrium or close to it .",
    "these haloes are the dominant structures at late times and several properties of the density field can be deduced by considering the haloes to be the basic unit @xcite .",
    "this approach is known as the halo model .",
    "given a distribution of points , estimation of @xmath0-point correlation functions is a very difficult task as this computation requires @xmath11 floating point operations for a set of @xmath12 particles .",
    "one can , however , compute the moments of counts in cells and recover some information about @xmath0-point correlation functions @xcite . in this method",
    ", we distribute a large number of cells in the volume containing the distribution of points and count the number of particles in each cell .",
    "the count probability distribution function ( cpdf ) is a function of the cell size and the count , of course .",
    "the cpdf contains full information about the distribution of points .",
    "it can be used to estimate the moments , which in turn are related to the @xmath0-point correlation functions .",
    "the number of operations required for calculating the cpdf at a given scale is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number density of particles and @xmath15 is the volume of each cell .",
    "this reduction in the computation required is remarkable but there is also a reduction in the amount of information we can recover about the @xmath0-point correlation functions . to illustrate this",
    ", we give some basic definitions here : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of particles in a cell and @xmath18 is its average value for cells of a given size .",
    "@xmath19 are moments of the cpdf about the average and these can be related to @xmath0-point correlation functions .",
    "@xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the mean two point correlation function , @xmath22 is the mean three point correlation function and @xmath23 is the corresponding four point function @xcite . note that lower order correlation functions contribute a non - trivial amount to higher order moments and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , etc .",
    "correspond to the irreducible part of the @xmath0th order correlation function .",
    "these expressions include corrections for shot noise . from here",
    ", we can define reduced moments as : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the skewness and @xmath26 is kurtosis .",
    "these reduced moments are expected to vanish in the linear regime for gaussian initial conditions .",
    "gravitational instability introduces mode coupling and this leads to generation of non - gaussian features .",
    "perturbation theory can be used to estimate the values of skewness and other reduced moments in the weakly non - linear regime ( @xmath27 ) . for power law models in an einstein - de sitter universe ,",
    "the reduced moments do not depend on scale in this regime @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 here @xmath0 is the index of the initial power spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "it is difficult to obtain a direct solution in the strongly non - linear regime .",
    "stable clustering and hierarchical clustering predict a constant asymptotic value @xcite @xmath29 therefore we expect @xmath25 ( and also @xmath26 ) to grow from their value in the weakly non - linear regime ( eqn.([sn_lin ] ) ) to a larger value in the extremely non - linear regime ( eqn.([sn_nl ] ) ) .",
    "the increase is larger for indices with small @xmath30 , as is clear from eqn.([sn_nl ] ) .",
    "small departures from the stable clustering hypothesis have been seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "redshift surveys of galaxies give us information about the location of galaxies in the redshift space .",
    "combination of the peculiar motion of galaxies and cosmological expansion determines the redshift of a galaxy and as a result the location in redshift space is different from the location of the galaxy in real space .",
    "this affects the estimated position along the line of sight and does not change the location transverse to the line of sight .",
    "thus redshift space distortions introduce anisotropy in the distribution of galaxies , even if there is no statistical anisotropy in the galaxy distribution in real space . on small scales ,",
    "the random motions in virialised haloes stretch these into radially elongated _ fingers - of - god_. even though the effect originates from random motions in compact clusters , it is relevant at scales as much as twenty times the size of a typical cluster . on very large scales ,",
    "infall due to gravitational clustering compresses over dense regions along the line of sight .",
    "the compression is a function of infall velocities , and these depend on the density parameter of non - relativistic matter .",
    "this compression leads to an amplification of power spectrum and correlation function at these scales @xcite .",
    "for galaxies and other tracers of the matter distribution , the compression also depends on bias , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "the halo model @xcite has been used to model the effect of redshift space distortions on the non - linear power spectrum at scales where the dominant contribution is from random motions in virialised haloes @xcite . at small scales , where the coherent motion of galaxies due to large scale flows @xcite can be ignored , the relation between the observed density in real space @xmath31 and that in redshift space @xmath32 can be expressed as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 is the distribution function of peculiar velocities and @xmath35 in these equations @xmath4 is , as before , the present value of hubble constant . the observer is presumed to be at the origin of the coordinates and @xmath36 is the unit vector towards any location @xmath37 in the redshift space .    within the formalism of the halo model the amplitude of the power spectrum at small scales ( large @xmath38 ) is dominated by halo profiles and virial motions within haloes act to reduce the amplitude of the power in redshift space .",
    "if one assumes that in real space the halos are isotropic , virialised and approximately isothermal with @xmath39 velocity dispersion @xmath40 , then the peculiar motions _ within _ a halo add a gaussian noise to the redshift space radial coordinate @xcite in fourier space .",
    "@xmath41 , \\label{white1}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum can be calculated by integrating over @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "however , we are interested in higher moments and the anisotropic halo profile is required for an accurate description .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     clustering properties of galaxies follow a pattern similar to clustering of highly over dense regions .",
    "indeed , the generic evolution of galaxy correlation function can be deduced by studying correlation function of over dense regions @xcite .",
    "figure  5 shows @xmath25 and @xmath26 as a function of @xmath21 for particles in regions with @xmath44 . here ,",
    "the density contrast @xmath45 is computed in real space and only particles in over dense regions with @xmath44 are retained .",
    "we study the clustering properties of these particles in real and redshift space and compute the two point correlation function and reduced moments .",
    "we have plotted @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the three power law models and the @xmath46cdm model in figure  5 .",
    "we see from the panels for real space that the moments are smaller for over dense regions as compared to the distribution of all the particles .",
    "thus there are two reasons for reduction of moments in redshift space : bias and redshift space distortions .",
    "figure  5 suggests that redshift space distortions are often the more dominant factor leading to reduction of skewness , etc . at scales with @xmath47",
    "the reduced moments are almost constant ; this feature is shared with the behaviour for the mass distribution .",
    "the non - gaussian tail of the cpdf gets contribution mainly from very massive haloes , hence this is almost the same for the full distribution and over dense regions .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the variation of skewness , etc . with scales is almost the same for matter distribution and over dense regions .",
    "the variation of @xmath48 with @xmath21 seen here is consistent with that seen for galaxies in the two degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "we are carrying out further analysis with models for occupation number in haloes in order to do a more quantitative comparison of models with the observed moments @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented results of a study of the moments of counts of cells in real space as well as redshift space for power law models .",
    "these models are used to develop insights into the variation of the probability distribution function .",
    "we also use simulations of the @xmath46cdm model .",
    "we verify that in the weakly non - linear regime the skewness and kurtosis take on values calculated using perturbation theory .",
    "this is true in both the real and redshift space , though the finger - of - god effect leads to slightly smaller values in redshift space .",
    "we find that the values of higher moments like the skewness and the kurtosis in the non - linear regime are very different in redshift space as compared to the corresponding values in real space .",
    "higher moments are very sensitive to the non - gaussian tail of the cpdf and we study that in order to understand the differences in values of moments in real and redshift space . we find that at highly non - linear scales , the tail of the cpdf in redshift space falls off very sharply much before the tail of cpdf in real space for the same model .",
    "this pattern is similar for different power spectra and we hypothesise that redshift space distortions ( the finger - of - god effect ) play a very important role in determining the form of the cpdf at small scales .",
    "we use the halo model to compute the form of the non - gaussian tail of the cpdf in real and redshift space and find that we are able to reproduce the behaviour observed in n - body simulations .",
    "the rapid fall off of the cpdf in redshift space provides a natural explanation for the much smaller values of the skewness and kurtosis in the non - linear regime .",
    "indeed , this also accounts for the much smaller differences in the values of reduced moments for different models .",
    "we show that the above results carry over to the @xmath46cdm model as well .",
    "this indicates that at non - linear scales , higher moments of the cpdf are relatively insensitive to the cosmological background .",
    "we also study moments for highly over dense regions in order to estimate the effect of bias on skewness , etc . in this case the moments in the non - linear regime take on smaller values as compared to the values for all the particles at the same scales .",
    "the reduction of moments in real space is related to the value of bias and can be modelled analytically in the weakly non - linear regime @xcite .",
    "thus there are two reasons for reduction of moments in the non - linear regime ; whereas bias applies in both the real space and redshift space , redshift space distortions operate only in the latter .",
    "figures  4 and 5 suggest that redshift space distortions are the stronger effect in almost all the cases .",
    "we have shown that the halo model can be used successfully to model clustering in redshift space .",
    "this is very different from other approaches that have been employed for modelling the effect of redshift space distortions on clustering @xcite .",
    "we propose to use this approach to model the three point correlation function , etc . in future studies .",
    "numerical experiments for this study were carried out at the cluster computing facility in the harish - chandra research institute ( http://cluster.mri.ernet.in ) .",
