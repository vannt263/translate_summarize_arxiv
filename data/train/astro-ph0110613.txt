    "the question of the origin of cosmic rays ( crs ) of the highest energies is currently a subject of much intense debate and discussion .",
    "the highest energy cosmic ray ( @xmath11 ev ) was detected by fly s eye fluorescence detector @xcite confirming the existence of cosmic rays with macroscopic energies above the greisen , zatsepin , and kuzmin cut - off ( @xmath12  ev ) @xcite . in addition the agasa group have reported 8 events with energies above 100 eev and other very energetic events with energies beyond the gzk cut - off have been described by the volcano ranch , haverah park and yakutsk groups @xcite .",
    "these ultra high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) pose a serious challenge for conventional theories of crs based on stochastic acceleration .",
    "the non - observation of the high energy cut - off expected because of the interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , indicates that their sources must be nearby thus posing serious restrictions as to their origin .",
    "there is currently a significant experimental effort underway , focussed around hires @xcite , the pierre auger observatory @xcite and euso @xcite , aimed at dramatically improving the statistics at the highest energies .    the old idea of attempting to detect high - energy neutrinos through studying very inclined air showers",
    "( has)@xcite has been recently revived with the calculation of the acceptance of the auger observatories for the detection of high - energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "ultra high energy ( uhe ) neutrinos ( above eev ) are almost inevitable in models that seek to explain the uhe cosmic rays . at large zenith angles , cosmic rays ( whether they are protons , nuclei or photons ) develop ordinary showers in the top layers of the atmosphere in a very similar fashion to the well - understood vertical showers .",
    "their electromagnetic component is , however , almost completely absorbed by the greatly enhanced atmospheric slant depth ( 3000 g  @xmath13 at 70@xmath14 from zenith ) and thus prevented from reaching ground level .",
    "high energy neutrinos may induce has much deeper in the atmosphere close to an air shower array .",
    "by contrast , these showers at ground level resemble vertical air showers in their particle content and other features .    the main background to uhe neutrino induced has is expected to be due to the remaining muon component of the cosmic rays showers , after practically all of the electromagnetic component is absorbed .",
    "these @xmath15 that penetrate the whole atmospheric depth to ground level are the object of this study .",
    "although originally this project was conceived as a study of the background to neutrino - induced showers we have come to the conclusion that the interest in has induced by cosmic rays goes well beyond that expectation .",
    "the measurement of high zenith angle showers will enhance the aperture of the existing air shower arrays , and will increase the data on cosmic ray arrival directions to previously inaccessible directions in galactic coordinates @xcite .",
    "besides these obvious advantages , high zenith angle cosmic ray showers are unique because the shower front is dominated by relatively energetic muons that travel long distances , opening up the possibility of probing interactions in a region of phase space quite inaccessible in vertical air showers .",
    "cosmic ray induced has are different from vertical showers mainly because they consist largely of muons which are produced far from ground level .",
    "the particle density profiles for has induced by protons or heavy nuclei display complex muon patterns at the ground which result from the long path lengths traveled by the muons in the presence of the earth s magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these patterns are difficult to analyse @xcite and invalidate the conventional approach used for interpretation of low zenith angle showers ( @xmath16 ) , which is usually based on the approximate circular symmetry of the density profiles .",
    "the analysis of has produced by cosmic rays requires a radically different approach such as the one presented in this work .",
    "we apply our approach to data recorded by the haverah park experiment .",
    "the haverah park array , being made of 1.2  m deep water erenkov tanks @xcite , is the detector array so far constructed which is best suited on geometrical considerations for the analysis of very large inclined showers .",
    "moreover it can be considered as a prototype of the auger observatories , which will employ water erenkov tanks of identical depth .",
    "the quantitative aspects of our results are very specific to the water erenkov technique as we have previously taken into account in great detail the interaction of the shower particles in the water detectors @xcite .",
    "in this paper we give a much more detailed account of a report already published @xcite .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section 2 we discuss the main features of inclined showers , the muon distributions , the different sources of electrons and photons and the shower front curvature . in section 3",
    "we give a brief description of the haverah park array , its detectors and their response to the passage of different particles from the shower front . in section 4",
    "we develop an algorithm reconstruct the arrival directions and energies of inclined air showers detected with haverah park . in section 5",
    "we describe a procedure to generate artificial events based on shower generation and measurements of the cosmic ray spectrum . in section 6",
    "we compare the high zenith angle data to the artificial event distributions obtained under different assumptions about the nature of the primary particles that constitute the cosmic ray energy spectrum above @xmath2  ev .",
    "we extract bounds on photons above @xmath2 ev . finally in section 7",
    "we discuss our results and review their implications . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will describe the use of this technique to yield the proton / iron ratio as a function of energy above 1 eev .",
    "as the zenith angle varies from the vertical , @xmath17 , to the horizontal , @xmath18 , direction , the slant matter depth rises from @xmath19 to @xmath20  g  @xmath13 and for angles above @xmath21 the cosmic ray showers at ground level are observed well past the shower maximum . in inclined showers of zenith angles exceeding @xmath22 the electromagnetic component arising from the hadron shower through @xmath23 decay can be neglected at ground level . for zenith angles between @xmath21 and @xmath22 the relative signal of this component in a 1.2  m deep water erenkov detector is small except for distances within a few hundred meters from shower axis . while the electromagnetic component of air showers is exponentially attenuated with depth , the muons that are too energetic to decay , have few catastrophic interactions and only suffer ionization losses , scattering and geomagnetic deflection .",
    "they constitute the dominant component of the shower front for inclined showers .",
    "the muon patterns at ground level have been studied in @xcite .",
    "there is a residual electromagnetic component in the shower front which is produced by the muons themselves , mostly through muon decay .",
    "other muon interactions contribute either little to the electromagnetic component or only within a narrow region about shower axis .",
    "the distribution of the muon component at ground level becomes complex at large zenith angles because of magnetic field effects .",
    "the spatial distribution of muons can no longer be characterized by a simple function of one parameter ( distance to the shower axis , @xmath24 ) because of the asymmetry generated mostly by the geomagnetic effects . in @xcite an analytic model to account for the average muon number densities at ground level in presence of a magnetic field for proton showers at high zenith angles is presented and described in detail .",
    "we outline its main features because the work presented here relies heavily upon it .",
    "the approach consists of studying the muon distributions in the absence of magnetic field effects so that they have cylindrical symmetry to an excellent approximation .",
    "the distributions are described by functions of one variable ( @xmath24 ) , the lateral distribution functions , in a plane perpendicular to the shower axis , the transverse plane .",
    "a very strong anticorrelation between the average muon energy and distance of the muon from the shower axis has been described @xcite .",
    "magnetic deviations of the muons are subsequently applied to the circularly symmetric distributions , making use of the aforementioned anticorrelation and assuming the muons are produced in a fixed region of the atmosphere .",
    "the magnetic distortions induced in the muon distributions are described by considering the projection of the earth s magnetic field onto the transverse plane . as the zenith angle increases the patterns obtained in the transverse plane gradually change from elliptical distributions to two lobed figures reflecting an increased distance traveled by the muons which results in enhanced distortions .",
    "the double lobe patterns correspond to positive and negative muons totally separated by the magnetic field which acts as a spectrometer for the muons in the shower .",
    "moreover as the azimuth changes , both the magnitude of the magnetic field projection onto the transverse plane and its relative orientation with respect to the ground , change , further increasing the diversity of the resulting patterns projected onto the ground .",
    "the description of the average muon density patterns thus requires three inputs :    @xmath25 the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) .",
    "@xmath25 the average muon energy as a function of radius ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xmath25 the mean distance to the muon production point ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "all these values must first be evaluated in the absence of magnetic effects .",
    "the model also requires knowledge of the muon energy distribution at a fixed distance to the shower axis .",
    "a log - normal distribution of width 0.4 has been found to be sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes .",
    "the validity of the analytical description has been evaluated by comparing full shower simulations for different arrival directions with those obtained by this procedure . a comparison of muon densities in this model to those obtained by simulation",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ contour80 ] .",
    "the simulations of the density distributions both with and without the magnetic field have been made with the aires @xcite code .",
    "tests for proton showers using the sibyll @xcite hadronic interaction generator at a fixed energy of @xmath2  ev , and four different zeniths are described in @xcite .",
    "this approach is independent of model details and can be applied to other hadronic generators , mass compositions , and energies by changing the corresponding inputs .",
    "it allows the comparison of muon density patterns at ground level through these simple inputs .",
    "a significant advantage is that , provided the lateral distribution function is parameterized by a continuous function , the muon density patterns obtained in the transverse plane are smooth functions in contrast to distributions obtained with any monte carlo simulation .",
    "this key point allows us to reconstruct the energy of individual events , as we describe below .",
    "we have also found @xcite that to a good approximation the inputs to our model are energy independent for a given primary , so the muon number density distributions for any primary energy can be obtained simply by normalizing the total number of muons of a fixed energy shower .",
    "these results apply to showers both with and without the magnetic field .",
    "the energy dependence of the normalization factor can be obtained by monitoring the total muon number in the showers ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath28 from simulations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ escale ] for four different zenith angles .",
    "the energy dependence of the normalization can be taken into account accurately by a simple relation of the following form : @xmath29^{\\beta } ,   \\label{escaling}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 ( the number of muons at @xmath2  ev ) and @xmath31 are constant parameters for a given hadronic interaction model and mass composition . for different",
    "zenith angles the energy scaling index , @xmath31 , is the same and only the normalization @xmath30 changes .",
    "furthermore the muon distributions at ground level are hardly different in shape for iron and proton .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fevsp2 ] and [ fevsp ] where muon densities patterns and densities along given lines parallel to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 directions in the transverse plane axes are compared for iron and proton primaries . to a good approximation",
    "the differences can be accounted for by differences in the total number of muons . for a given model and primary composition the energy dependence of very inclined showers",
    "can be parameterized with only two parameters . in table",
    "[ nmu.tab ] the results for these two parameters for proton and iron in two interaction models are shown .",

    "( [ escaling ] ) ) , for a zenith angle of 60@xmath14 . [ cols=\"<,>,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this work improves and extends the results presented in @xcite and is compatible with it .",
    "there are however slight differences which are due to the improvements , namely :    1 .   improved muon density parameterizations , now in @xmath34 steps .",
    "2 .   inclusion of densities below threshold in the fitting algorithm .",
    "3 .   better treatment of the electromagnetic part of the shower from muon decay .",
    "4 .   inclusion of events with original zenith angle @xmath35 .    the inclusion of three additional events in table [ tab ] compared with what was obtained in @xcite , and the changes in the energies of some events should be noted .",
    "it must be stressed that the new energy always lies within the error quoted in @xcite , and the three new events were not included in the original list because they failed to pass the cut on the downwards error .",
    "the photoelectron distributions in a water detector show long tails due to the processes mentioned in section [ signalhor ] .",
    "we therefore expect an excess of upward fluctuations over downward fluctuations from the average detector signal . for each event",
    "we calculate the probability that each of the detectors involved has a signal which deviates by more than @xmath362.5@xmath37 from the average using the simulated photoelectron distributions . we reject signals having ( upward or downward ) deviations greater than 2.5  @xmath38 , recalculating the best - fit core after any rejection . of 226 densities in the events described below and listed in table  [ tab ]",
    "we have rejected 12 upward deviations ( the expected number was 17 ) and a single downward deviation .",
    "we consider this to be a strong vindication of our understanding of the signal in the tanks and of our modeling procedures .",
    "besides the fitting of the individual events it is extremely important to compare the data obtained with expectations .",
    "we have simulated `` artificial '' events assuming a given energy spectrum for the cosmic rays , taken from other experiments and assuming different primary compositions . in order to compare the simulated results to those obtained from the data",
    ", we must also calculate the reconstruction efficiency which is sensitive to the cuts made . throughout",
    "we use the qgsjet as the hadronic generator of the simulations .",
    "we have generated showers in the range of energies @xmath39  ev to @xmath40  ev in bins of 0.05 in @xmath41 .",
    "for each of these energy bins we have adjusted the number of artificial events generated to approximately obtain @xmath42 showers that trigger the array .",
    "the procedure for generating each artificial event is the following :    1 .",
    "we randomly select an arrival direction assuming isotropy according to a @xmath43 distribution for zenith angle and a uniform distribution for azimuth ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "each shower is directed on to the array with a random impact point position in the transverse plane up to 2.5 km away from the centre of the array .",
    "each time a shower is directed at the array , the total muon number(@xmath28 ) is fluctuated to take into account shower fluctuations . for proton and iron primaries we used a gaussian distribution of spread 0.2@xmath45 , and for photon primaries we used the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fluct_ph ] .",
    "the density in the ground plane at the location of each of the detectors is read from the library of muon density maps .",
    "the corresponding signal and arrival time in each of the detectors is generated ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the trigger condition of the haverah park array is tested .",
    "if an event is deemed to trigger the array then the density and time information is recorded in the same format as the real data .",
    "each artificial event is assigned a weight ( @xmath46 ) which is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the total number of events generated in a particular energy bin , fulfilling , or not , the triggering condition and @xmath49 is the total number of cr expected from the assumed flux for the same energy bin integrated over the zenith angle range considered ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the artificial events , recorded in the same format as real data , are analysed with the same algorithm assuming a proton composition for the maps and with qgsjet as the hadronic generator , and applying the same cuts .",
    "the resulting spectrum is obtained by adding the weights of the individual artificial events at the corresponding reconstructed energies .",
    "the signal in each detector is artificially generated as follows :    1 .",
    "the projected area of the detector in the shower plane is calculated .",
    "2 .   given the local muon density and the projected area , the number of incident muons is sampled from a poisson distribution .",
    "the track length of each muon through the detector is sampled from a distribution obtained analytically from the detector geometry ( see fig .  [",
    "array]c ) .",
    "the contribution of indirect erenkov light from the incident muons and from @xmath51-ray electrons is calculated from the sampled track lengths ( 12 pe for each 1.2 m of track , with an additional 3 pe/1.2 m to account for the signal from @xmath51-rays ) . 5 .",
    "the signal from direct light on the pmts is related to the detector geometry in a more complex way and is implemented using wtank to simulate the passage of muons through the whole detector for a range of zenith and azimuth angles .",
    ".   the electromagnetic component of the shower due to muon decay is approximated by the addition of a number of photoelectrons per muon ( @xmath52 ) which depends smoothly on zenith angle .",
    ".   the electromagnetic component of the shower from @xmath23 decay is calculated using the parameterizations discussed in section 3 .",
    "the signal generated in this way is fluctuated according to measurement errors .",
    "the arrival time of the first muon is generated assuming a spherical shower front with radius equal to the mean distance to the production site of the muons at each particular zenith angle .",
    "the time is then fluctuated according to measurement and sampling errors .",
    "we assume a recent parameterization of the energy spectrum given in @xcite noting that the agreement between the fluorescence estimates of the spectrum and those made by other methods implies that we have an approximately mass independent knowledge of the spectrum measured in the near - vertical direction .",
    "the flux above 10@xmath53 ev is assumed to be known to within 20@xmath54 uncertainty .",
    "we will compare to the results obtained using an alternative energy spectrum given in @xcite .",
    "both fluxes are compared in fig .",

    "[ chis ] , [ errors ] , [ zendist ] , [ zenerr ] we show different output parameters of the event reconstruction for the artificial events assuming a proton composition and the spectrum given in @xcite , compared to data .",
    "all the events used in these figures pass the cuts described in the previous section , in particular for energies above @xmath2  ev , @xmath55 km .",
    "the agreement obtained is encouraging and suggests that the simulation accurately mimics the data .    in fig .",
    "[ energycomp ] we show the energy resolution for different energy ranges .",
    "a finite energy resolution has the effect of increasing the measured rate by misinterpreting more abundant lower energy events as having a higher energy .",
    "however no corrections need be made in this approach because the same effect is present both in data and simulations .",
    "after all the quality cuts are implemented as discussed in section [ algo.sec ] we calculate the event rate as a function of the primary energy integrating over all zenith and azimuth angles .",
    "we will concentrate here on the events with reconstructed proton energy above @xmath1ev , which provide the most stringent conclusions about uhecr composition .    in fig .",
    "[ rate2 ] we show both the integral and differential energy spectra obtained from the artificial events under three different assumptions for the primary composition ( protons , iron and photons ) compared to the data using the cosmic ray parameterization given in @xcite .",
    "we also show the spectra obtained using the cosmic ray flux spectrum from @xcite , see fig .",
    "all curves are for the qgsjet hadronic interaction model .",
    "the agreement between the curves generated for protons with the two spectra is remarkable .",
    "the normalization of the curves has not been manually adjusted .",
    "the expected rate increases if iron is assumed and decreases if photons are assumed .",
    "this just a matter of counting muons , heavier nuclei have more muons while photons are known to have much fewer muons . for the same reason shifts in the curves can be expected if different hadronic interaction models are used according to the number of muons they predict .",
    "the remarkable point about this graph is that the expected rate for photons is about an order of magnitude below the proton prediction . assuming that cosmic rays have a proton / photon mixture at ultra high energies it is easy to obtain a bound from this graph .",
    "we can get bounds on photon abundance at a given confidence level comparing the measured number of events above a given threshold and its error to the expected numbers in the case of proton and photon compositions , taking into account the uncertainty in the prediction from the normalization error in the parameterization of the cosmic ray spectrum . assuming the prediction obtained with the flux in @xcite we obtain that less than @xmath3 of the observed events above @xmath1ev can be photons with a @xmath4 confidence level . above @xmath5 ev less than @xmath56 can be photons at the same confidence level . if we assume the spectrum of @xcite instead the bound for photon increases ( decreases ) to @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) at energies above @xmath1ev ( @xmath59ev ) .    the results for the photon bound depend on the hadronic model we choose but in a way that is conservative .",
    "if we were to chose a model that produces fewer muons that qgsjet we would predict a composition heavier than protons .",
    "if we chose a model that produces more muons , we would require a lighter composition and more photon flux would be allowed . from the kascade project",
    "@xcite it is evident that all models tested except for sibyll produce muon rates above that found in the data .",
    "so models that produce more muons are disfavoured .",
    "our photon bound is also conservative because we have not taken into account the interactions of the high energy photons in the magnetic field of the earth @xcite .",
    "this has the effect of converting a single energetic photon into a few lower energy photons . as the total number of muons in a shower initiated by a single photon scales approximately with @xmath60 , the number of muons in a shower initiated by a single photon exceeds the total number of muons if the photon energy is split into multiple photon showers of lower energy .",
    "the implementation of photohadronic interactions in the aires code  @xcite and corsika code  @xcite ( using the parameterization of @xcite ) give predictions of the total number of muons that are equal to within 10% at @xmath2  ev . unless the photoproduction cross section has a dramatic increase at high energies , the photon bound is robust because the photoproduction cross section is small relative to hadronic interactions .",
    "conventional acceleration mechanisms , so called  bottom up  scenarios , predict an extragalactic origin with mainly proton composition as although nuclei of higher charge are more easily accelerated they are fragile to photonuclear processes in the strong photon fields to be expected in likely source regions @xcite . ",
    "models explain the highest energy cosmic rays arising from the decay of some sufficiently massive `` x - particles '' .",
    "these models predict particles such as nucleons , photons and even possibly neutrinos as the high energy cosmic rays , but not nuclei . in some models @xcite these x",
    "- particles are postulated as long - living metastable super - heavy relic particles ( msrp ) clustering in our galactic halo . for these msrp models a photon dominated primary composition at @xmath2 ev",
    "is expected .",
    "other top down models @xcite associate x - particles with processes involving systems of cosmic topological defects which are uniformly distributed in the universe , and predict a photon dominated composition only above @xmath61  ev .    on general grounds dominance of photons over protons is expected for these models due to the qcd fragmentation functions of quarks and gluons from x - particle decays into mesons and baryons .",
    "the ratio of photons to protons for msrp models is typically 10 @xcite at 10@xmath53 ev from qcd fragmentation .",
    "however some models predict a ratio closer to 2 @xcite .",
    "the difference depends on distance to the sources because the photons attenuate in shorter distances than the protons in the cosmic microwave background and thus can become suppressed relative to the protons if the sources are distant .",
    "clearly , our bound on the photon flux puts severe constraints on some  top down  models .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ abund2 ] where this ratio is plotted for three such models and compared to our bound .",
    "observations above @xmath2  ev are otherwise consistent with both top down and bottom up interpretations @xcite .",
    "there is however some partial evidence against the photon hypothesis .",
    "shower development of the highest energy event @xcite , is inconsistent with a photon initiated shower @xcite while agasa measurements of the muon lateral distribution of the highest energy events are compatible with a proton origin  @xcite .",
    "our result has been recently confirmed by comparing muon and electron densities in vertical air showers detected by the agasa array @xcite .",
    "here we have described a new method to analyse inclined showers .",
    "the method opens up a new way to measure cosmic ray showers .",
    "these showers are complementary to vertical showers because they are mostly due to muons that are produced far away from the detection point .",
    "the method can be applied to array detectors that use water erenkov tanks such as the auger observatories now in construction .",
    "the power of analysing inclined showers is illustrated with the analysis of the haverah park data .",
    "this analysis has allowed us to set the first limit to the photon content of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "we conclude that observations of inclined showers provide a powerful tool to discriminate between photon and proton dominated compositions .",
