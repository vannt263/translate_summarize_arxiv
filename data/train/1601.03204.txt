    "these tools have been utilized in solving a variety of problems such as signal recovery on graphs  @xcite , clustering and community detection  @xcite , graph signal denoising  @xcite , and semi - supervised classification on graphs@xcite .",
    "+ transforms aimed at frequency analysis of graph signals facilitate efficient handling of the data and remain at the heart of graph signal processing . in literature , there exist two frameworks for frequency analysis and processing of graph signals : ( i ) laplacian matrix based approach , and ( ii ) weight matrix based approach .",
    "the existing laplacian based approach  @xcite is limited to the analysis of graph signals lying on undirected graphs with real non - negative weights . in the laplacian based approach , eigendecomposition of the graph laplacian @xmath1",
    "is used for frequency analysis of graph signals .",
    "mathematically , graph fourier transform ( gft ) of a graph signal @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 $ ] is the matrix in which columns are the eigenvectors of @xmath1 . here",
    ", the frequency ordering is based on the quadratic form and turns out to be `` natural '' .",
    "natural frequency ordering means that the small eigenvalues correspond to low frequencies and vice - versa .",
    "on the other hand , the weight matrix based framework  @xcite , also referred as the discrete signal processing on graphs ( dsp@xmath5 ) framework , has been built on the graph shift operator .",
    "the weight matrix  @xmath6 of the graph acts as the shift operator and the shifted version of a graph signal  @xmath2 can be found as @xmath7 .",
    "shift operator is treated as the elementary linear shift invariant ( lsi ) graph filter , which essentially is a polynomial in  @xmath6 .",
    "based on the shift operator , authors define total variation ( tv ) on graphs that they utilize for ordering of graph frequencies . in dsp@xmath5 ,",
    "the graph fourier transform of a graph signal @xmath2 is defined as  @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the matrix with the jordan eigenvectors of @xmath6 as its columns ( @xmath6 is decomposed in jordan canonical form as @xmath10 ) .",

    "+ although dsp@xmath5 is applicable to directed graphs with negative or complex edge weights as well , it does not provide `` natural '' intuition of frequency .",
    "the eigenvalue of @xmath6 with _ maximum _ absolute value acts as the _ lowest _ frequency and as one moves away from this eigenvalue in the complex frequency plane , the frequency increases . thus , frequency ordering is not natural and there is an overhead of frequency ordering as well . also , the interpretation of frequency is not intuitive  for example , in general , a constant graph signal results in low as well as high frequency components in the spectral domain .",

    "moreover , the new definition of gft links the dsp@xmath0 framework to the existing laplacian based approach . we also show that considering our proposed shift operator , the lsi filters under dsp@xmath0 become polynomial in the directed laplacian .",
    "+ rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : freqanalysis ] , we discuss the directed laplacian of a graph followed by the proposed shift operator and total variation on graph .",
    "then , we redefine the graph fourier transform based on directed laplacian .",
    "we describe lsi graph filters in section  [ sec : filtering ] and then conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "first , we present directed laplacian matrix of a graph and then , derive the shift operator from it .",
    "next , we define total variation of a graph signal which is utilized in frequency ordering . finally , we redefine graph fourier transform under the dsp@xmath0 framework .      a graph signal is a collection of values defined on a complex and irregular structure modeled as a graph .",
    "a graph is represented as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the set of vertices ( or nodes ) and @xmath6 is the weight matrix of the graph in which an element @xmath13 represents the weight of the directed edge from node @xmath14 to node @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , a graph signal is represented as an @xmath16-dimensional vector @xmath17 ^t \\in \\mathbb{c}^{n}$ ] , where @xmath18 is the value of the graph signal at node @xmath15 and @xmath19 is the total number of nodes in the graph .      as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the graph laplacian for undirected graphs is a symmetric difference operator @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the degree matrix of the graph and @xmath6 is the weight matrix of the graph .",
    "however , in case of directed graphs ( or digraphs ) , the weight matrix @xmath6 of a graph is not symmetric .",
    "in addition , the degree of a vertex can be defined in two ways  @xcite  in - degree and out - degree . in - degree of a node",
    "@xmath15 is estimated as @xmath22 , whereas , out - degree of the node  @xmath15 can be calculated as @xmath23 .",
    "we consider in - degree matrix and define the directed laplacian @xmath1 of a graph as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the in - degree matrix .",
    "[ fig : dirgraphexample](a ) shows an example weighted directed graph and the corresponding matrices are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dirgraphexample](b)-(d ) .",
    "clearly , the laplacian for directed graph is not symmetric , nevertheless , it follows some important properties : ( i ) sum of each row is zero and hence , @xmath26 is surely an eigenvalue , and ( ii ) real parts of the eigenvalues are non - negative for a graph with positive edge - weights .",

    "however , we choose eq .",
    "( [ eq : outlap ] ) as the definition of graph laplacian for our analysis .",
    "we identify the shift operator from the graph structure corresponding to a discrete time periodic signal and then extend it to arbitrary graphs . +",
    "a finite duration periodic discrete signal can be thought of as a graph signal lying on a directed cyclic graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dircyclic ] . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : dircyclic ] is the support of a periodic time - series having a period of five samples .",

    "[ fig : dircyclic ] . shifting the signal @xmath34 by one unit to the right results in the signal @xmath35^t$ ] .",
    "this shifted version of the signal can also be found as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is treated as the shift operator ( matrix ) .",
    "+ we extend the notion of shift to arbitrary graphs and consequently use @xmath37 as the shift operator for graph signals .",
    "hence , the shifted version of a graph signal @xmath2 can be calculated as @xmath38 in contrast to the use of the weight matrix as the shift operator , we opt for the pre - mentioned shift operator which involves the directed laplacian .",
    "our selection of this shift matrix results in a better and simpler frequency analysis which will become evident in the subsequent sections .",
    "total variation ( tv ) of a graph signal is a measure of total amplitude oscillations in the signal values with respect to the graph .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , tv of a graph signal @xmath2 with respect to the graph @xmath39 can be given as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the derivative of the graph signal @xmath2 at vertex @xmath15 and is defined as the difference between the values of the original graph signal @xmath2 and its shifted version at vertex  @xmath15 : @xmath42 from eq .",

    ". we will utilize tv given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : graphtv ] ) to estimate variations of the graph fourier basis and subsequently to identify low and high frequencies of a graph .",
    "dsp@xmath0 derives analogy from the perspective of lsi filtering . in dsp@xmath0 ,",
    "lsi graph filters are polynomials in the graph weight matrix @xmath6 and as a result the eigenvectors of @xmath6 become the eigenfunctions of lsi graph filters .",
    "analogous to the fact that the complex exponentials are invariant to lsi filtering in classical signal processing , the eigenvectors of @xmath6 are utilized as the graph fourier basis .",
    "+ we redefine the graph fourier transform under dsp@xmath0 .",
    "we consider the jordan eigenvectors of the graph laplacian matrix as the graph fourier basis that are invariant to an lsi graph filter ( discussed in section  [ sec : filtering ] ) , which is a polynomial in  @xmath1 under proposed shift operator .",
    "using jordan decomposition , the graph laplacian is decomposed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , known as the jordan matrix , is a block diagonal matrix similar to @xmath1 and the jordan eigenvectors of @xmath1 constitute the columns of @xmath9 .",
    "we define gft of a graph signal @xmath2 as @xmath49    here , @xmath9 is treated as the graph fourier matrix whose columns constitute the graph fourier basis .",
    "inverse graph fourier transform can be calculated as @xmath50 in this definition of gft , the eigenvalues of the graph laplacian act as the graph frequencies and the corresponding jordan eigenvectors act as the graph harmonics .",
    "the eigenvalues with small absolute value correspond to low frequencies and vice - versa ; we will prove that shortly .",
    "thus , the frequency order turns out to be _",
    "natural_. + before discussing ordering of frequency , we consider a special case when the laplacian matrix is diagonalizable .      when the graph laplacian is diagonalizable , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lap_jordan ] ) is reduced to : @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues @xmath53 of @xmath1 and @xmath54 \\in \\mathbb{c}^{n\\times n}$ ] is the matrix with columns as the corresponding eigenvectors of @xmath1 .",
    "note that for a graph with real non - negative edge weights , the graph spectrum will lie in the right half of the complex frequency plane ( including the imaginary axis ) .",
    "for an undirected graph with real weights , the graph laplacian matrix @xmath1 is real and symmetric . as a result",
    ", the eigenvalues of @xmath1 turn out to be real and @xmath1 constitutes orthonormal set of eigenvectors . hence",
    ", the jordan form of the laplacian matrix for undirected graphs can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 , because the eigenvectors of @xmath1 are orthogonal in undirected case .",
    "consequently , gft of a signal @xmath2 can be given as @xmath57 and the inverse can be calculated as @xmath58 . note that the graph spectrum will lie on the real axis of the complex frequency plane , given the weight matrix is real .",
    "moreover , if the weights are non - negative as well , the graph spectrum will lie on the non - negative half of the real axis .",
    "this coincides with the gft presented in  @xcite , where only undirected graphs with real and non - negative weights were considered .",
    "thus , the new definition of gft unifies dsp@xmath0 and laplacian based approach .",
    "we utilize the definition of tv given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : graphtv ] ) to quantify oscillations in the graph harmonics , and subsequently to order the frequencies .",
    "the eigenvalues for which the corresponding proper eigenvectors have small variations are labeled as low frequencies and vice - versa .",
    "the frequency ordering is established by theorem  [ th : frequency_ordering ] .",
    "[ th : frequency_ordering ] let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be the eigenvectors with unit @xmath46-norm corresponding to two distinct complex eigenvalues @xmath61 of the laplacian matrix @xmath1 of the graph @xmath39 . if @xmath62 , then the tvs of these eigenvectors with respect to the graph @xmath39 satisfy @xmath63    let @xmath64 be the proper eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath65 of the laplacian matrix @xmath1 of the graph @xmath39 , then @xmath66 .",
    "now , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : graphtv ] ) , tv of @xmath64 with respect to the graph @xmath39 is calculated as @xmath67 if we scale all eigenvectors to have the same @xmath46-norm , then from the above analysis we note that @xmath68    0.26     0.18      +    0.26     0.18     note that tv of a proper eigenvector is directly proportional to the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "therefore , all the proper eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues having equal absolute value will have the same tv . as a result",
    ", distinct eigenvalues may sometimes yield exactly same tv . because of this reason ,",
    "sometimes frequency ordering is not unique .",
    "however , if all the eigenvalues are real , the frequency ordering is guaranteed to be unique .",
    "[ fig : freqorder ] shows the visualization of frequency ordering in the complex frequency plane ; @xmath69 corresponds to zero frequency and as we move away from the origin , the eigenvalues correspond to higher frequencies .",
    "+ an important point worth mentioning here is that we achieve same order of frequency as given by theorem  [ th : frequency_ordering ] even if we use quadratic form ( 2-dirichlet form ) in place of tv .",
    "2-dirichlet form  @xcite of a signal @xmath2 is defined as @xmath70 substituting @xmath41 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : graphgrad ] ) , we have @xmath71 now , quadratic form of a proper eigenvector @xmath64 corresponding to frequency @xmath65 can be calculated as @xmath72 . therefore , if all the eigenvectors are scaled to have same @xmath73-norm , then @xmath74 therefore , the frequency ordering based on the quadratic form will be same as given by theorem  [ th : frequency_ordering ] .",
    "let us consider a directed graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dirgraphexample](a ) . performing jordan decomposition of the laplacian matrix",
    ", we find the fourier matrix @xmath9 and jordan matrix @xmath48 as follows .",
    "@xmath75 @xmath76 eigenvalue  @xmath77 corresponds to the highest frequency of the graph .",
    "also note that the tvs of the eigenvectors corresponding to the frequencies @xmath78 and @xmath79 are equal because both of the frequencies have same absolute value .",

    "we can observe the presence of only zero frequency component in the spectrum of a constant graph signal .",
    "this is `` an evidence '' to the intuition that the variation in a constant graph signal is zero as we travel from a node to the other node connected by a directed edge .",
    "in contrast , the graph fourier transform defined in dsp@xmath0 fails to give this basic intuition .",
    "an lsi graph filter is a linear filter for which shifted version of the filter output is same as the filter output to the shifted input .",
    "that is , if @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the output of the filter @xmath86 corresponding to input @xmath87 , then the filter @xmath86 is shift - invariant ( si ) . the condition for a graph filter to be lsi is given by theorem  [ th : filterlsi ] .",
    "[ th : filterlsi ] a graph filter @xmath86 is lsi if the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "geometric multiplicity of each distinct eigenvalue of the graph laplacian is one .",
    "the graph filter @xmath86 is a polynomial in @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath86 can be written as    @xmath88    where @xmath89 are called filter taps .    from eq .",

    "considering a @xmath92-tap graph filter and substituting @xmath93 and @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lsi_filter ] ) , we get @xmath95 , which is the shift operator discussed in section  [ subsec : shiftop ] .",
