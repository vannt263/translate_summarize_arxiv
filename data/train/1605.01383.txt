    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) represents an attempt to understand physics of the early , planck scale universe by considering seriously the quantum features of the gravitational field .",
    "it is based on canonical quantization methods of symmetry reduced general relativity . the main difference with previous attempts being that the quantization strategy follows the one behind loop quantum gravity .",
    "the end result is that new effects that arise from the quantum nature of geometry at the planck scale become important in a certain regime and prevent the classical singularity , replacing it with a ` bounce ' .",
    "for details see @xcite and for a summary see ashtekar s contribution to this volume .",
    "the best understood models within lqc are homogeneous and isotropic models , and in particular the @xmath0=0 flrw model , where a complete quantization has been constructed ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "a physical hilbert space was constructed and the numerical evolution of rational physical observables exhibited a bounce replacing the big bang @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the model was exactly solved and matter density was shown to be absolutely bounded by a ` critical density ' @xmath1 of the order of planck density @xcite . furthermore , the dynamics of semiclassical states can be described by a simple  effective hamiltonian \" generating effective equations that capture the main ( loop ) quantum gravity corrections to the classical equations of motion @xcite .",
    "it turns out that all solutions to the effective equations bounce when the density is precisely @xmath1 .",
    "analytical and numerical studies have shown that semiclassical state follow the effective dynamics and bounce with a density arbitrarily close to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the quantization prescription that allowed to obtain all these results @xcite was shown to be unique when consistency and physical criteria are imposed @xcite .",
    "the closed model has also received much attention @xcite .",
    "numerical simulation have again shown that the big crunch and big bang singularities are replaced by a cyclic universe @xcite , well described by an effective theory .",
    "singularity resolution , just as in the flat case @xcite , was shown to be generic @xcite .",
    "the next step within homogenous cosmological models are anisotropic ,",
    " bianchi \" models .",
    "some of them are natural extensions of the flrw isotropic cases .",
    "for instance , the bianchi i model is spatially flat and reduces to the @xmath0=0 flrw in its isotropic sector .",
    "the bianchi ix model , on the other hand , reduces to the @xmath0=1 flrw model .",
    "this bianchi ix model is also important for a different reason .",
    "the so called bkl conjecture states that for generic inhomogenous models , in the dynamics close to the singularity , time derivatives dominate over space derivatives in such a way that the dynamics of nearby points decouple , and each one behaves as a bianchi ix model @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of bianchi ix is interesting by itself , with a ` mixmaster ' regime that can be described as a series of bianchi i epochs connected by bianchi ii transitions @xcite .",
    "a natural question is whether loop quantum cosmology can say something about the singularity resolution and possible modifications to the bkl dynamics near the planck scale . of course , the study of anisotropic models is not new in lqc .",
    "the bianchi i model was the first one to be studied @xcite , and the bianchi ii model followed @xcite .",
    "the bianchi ix model , in the simplest case with @xmath3=@xmath4 and no inverse corrections , was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "some of this corrections were introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "the issue of ambiguities in the quantum theory is not strange to loop quantization in cosmology . while for the simplest @xmath0=0 flrw model the quantization is assentially unique @xcite , it was first realized in @xcite that a spatially curved anisotropic model force to change the quantization strategy to define curvature . instead of using closed loops , as in the isotropic models",
    ", one can only define connections though open paths .",
    "this ambiguity was explored in the closed @xmath0=1 flrw model , where it was shown that the new quantization yields not one but two different bounces @xcite . for isotropic models",
    "there are also different ways of introducing the lapse function and the so called inverse corrections .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript and those that follow , is to study the ambiguities in the bianchi ix model by exploring different quantizations .",
    "this paper is the first in a series .",
    "here we introduce the new quantization where due care is taken for the inverse corrections . in the second paper in the series @xcite",
    ", we explore numerically the effective equations here found , for a massless scalar field . in the third paper of the series",
    ", we shall explore some qualitative implications of the quantization here presented , including the vacuum case @xcite ( some early result have already been presented in @xcite ) .",

    "[ sec:2 ] we introduce the model and the preliminaries necessary for the rest of the manuscript . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we introduce the new quantizations .",

    "the physical metric in diagonal manner can be written as q_ab = a_i^2^o_a^i^o_b^i . and",
    "thus the physical volume of @xmath16 is @xmath36 which is equal to @xmath37 .    since the fiducial frames and co - frames are fixed and because of the parametrization of connections and triads , the only relevant constraint is the hamiltonian constraint that has the form , _",

    "@xmath42 in terms of phase space variables is f_ab^k=2_o^2(c_ic_j-2c_k)^o^ijk^o_a^i^o_b^j where @xmath45 shows the orientation of physical frames ( that is , @xmath46 1 when @xmath47 and @xmath46 - 1 when @xmath48 ) .    for calculating the spin connection curvature it is convenient to first compute @xmath49 .",

    "to construct the quantum kinematics , we have to select a set of elementary observables such that their associated operators are unambiguous . in loop quantum gravity",

    "we generate the gravitational part of the kinematical hilbert space by considering countable linear combinations of orthonormal basis @xmath56 , where in this basis the operators @xmath57 s are diagonalized and satisfy l_1,l_2,l_3|l^_1,l^_2,l^_3=_l_1,l^_1_l_2,l^_2_l_3,l^_3 . .",

    "now , to define an operator related to the first term of eq.([hgc ] ) , we can use the right hand side of eq.([ths ] ) and replace poisson brackets with commutators . to find an operator related to the curvature @xmath42 ,",
    "for isotropic models and bianchi i , one can consider a square @xmath64 in the @xmath65 plane which is spanned by two of the fiducial triads ( for the closed isotropic model since triads do not commute , to define this plane we use a triad and a right invariant vector @xmath66 ) , with each of its sides having length @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , @xmath42 is given by @xmath68 since in loop quantum gravity , the area operator does not have a zero eigenvalue , one can take the limit of eq.([fs ] ) to the point where the area is equal to the smallest eigenvalue of the area operator , @xmath69 , instead of zero .",

    "@xmath74 to be consistent with other models , we choose @xmath75 thus the operators corresponding to the connection are given by @xcite @xmath76    also , one can see that the terms related to the curvatures , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , contain some negative powers of @xmath27 which are not well defined operators .",
    "to solve this problem we use the same idea in thiemann s strategy . @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the length of a curve and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , for these three different operators we have three different curve lengths ( @xmath80 ) where @xmath55 and @xmath81 can be some arbitrary functions of @xmath27 .",
    "for simplicity we shall choose all of them to be equal to @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand we have another free parameter in the definition of negative powers of @xmath27 which is @xmath83 .",

    "this paper is the first in a series devoted to the study of the bianchi ix model within lqc . in this contribution we introduced for the first time inverse corrections for bianchi ix and explored some of its properties .",
    "in particular we have studied the effective theory that follows from the quantum theory and have considered the behaviour of several geometric scalars .",
    "this is important to study singularity resolution within lqc .",
    "some of these questions are explored in the second paper of this series @xcite , where numerical solutions to the effective equations with a massless scalar field are studied .    in the study of the behaviour of expansion and shear for the effective theory ,",
    "we have shown that these scalars are not absolutely bounded , which might be a signal that the quantization is problematic @xcite . however , when one takes into account some energy conditions , one learns that the allowed region where solutions to the effective equations can be , becomes disconnected .",
    "there are two allowed regions and the solutions have to lie within one of them .",
    "the region where the would be singularity lies , and where large anisotropies are allowed , is disconnected from the region with large volume .",
    "thus , any realistic universe that reaches large volume at recollapse can not reach that region , and it can , at most , have a finite number of oscillations .",
    "thus , one might expect that loop quantum corrections to the dynamics have an important effect on the avoidance , not only of the singularity , but of the mixmaster behaviour that is so characteristic of the classical dynamics .",
