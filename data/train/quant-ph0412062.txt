    "quantum entanglement plays a central role in quantum information processing such as quantum teleportation@xcite , and quantum computation@xcite .",
    "however , the purity of entanglement is vulnerable to various environmental effects , which is an obstacle to realize these quantum information processing .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the multi pulse application can suppress the degradation of entanglement for a pair of qubits by focusing on concurrence as the degree of entanglement .",
    "we consider that the non - markovian nature of the reservoir is the key to suppress the decay of purity of entanglement .",
    "the method does not require high accuracy measurement , classical communication , or decreasing the number of pairs which have been requisite to execute entanglement concentration , purification or distillation@xcite .",
    "concurrence , a measure of purity of entanglement , has been introduced by wootters@xcite as @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the maximum eigenvalue of the operator @xmath2 which is defined by @xmath3 for the density matrix of the pair of qubits @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 where the @xmath7-component of the pauli matrix , @xmath8 , is associated with the spin - flip operation on the @xmath9-th qubits . in eq.([eqn:3 ] ) , @xmath10 is the complex conjugate of @xmath4 .",
    "since the complex conjugation is associated with time reversal of @xmath4@xcite , @xmath5 comprises spin - flip and time reversal operations on @xmath4 .",
    "the quantity of @xmath11 indicates the degree of equality between@xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this means that the concurrence reflects the  degree of equality \" between a density matrix under consideration and a density matrix obtained by spin - flip and time reversal . by this definition",
    ", we can consider that the concurrence describes the degree of reversibility of a pair of qubits after spin - flip , which suggests that , if we can control the time reversibility , we can directly control the entanglement .",
    "control of time reversibility on a single qubit have been studied in our previous papers@xcite by providing the physical background of the suppression of decoherence with multi pulse application , which is categorized to the bang - bang method@xcite .",
    "we have shown that the non - markovian nature of a reservoir plays an essential role to determine the degree of the effectiveness of suppression of decoherence of a single qubit . when a time evolution of a reservoir has non - markovian nature , or memory effect , the decoherence of a qubit is partial reversible . since @xmath12 pulse application causes a time reversal operation to a qubit , the time evolution of the qubit is partially reversed .",
    "we extend this to the case of a pair of qubits by using a linearly interacting spin - boson model .",
    "let us consider two extreme cases schematically shown in fig.[fig : fg1 ] : 1 ) common bath case : a pair of qubits interact with a common reservoir , 2 ) individual bath case : each qubit interacts with its own bath .",
    "when a pair of @xmath13 spins linearly interact with a common reservoir , the hamiltonian of this system is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the z - component of the @xmath9-th @xmath13 spin @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of @xmath19-th boson which composes the bath , and @xmath20 is the coupling strength between the spin and the @xmath19-th boson of the bath .",
    "this model is applicable to a pair of quantum dots in semiconductors@xcite .",
    "when an entangled qubit pair interacts with a noisy environment , the concurrence decays from the maximum value to zero , which indicates that the pair loses purity . to suppress the decay of purity ,",
    "let us consider the application of sufficiently short @xmath12 pulse sequence on both spins .",
    "the hamiltonian under pulse application is written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 indicates the field amplitude of @xmath23-th applied pulse . in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:9 ] ) , we assume that the both spins have the same magnetic moment @xmath24 and we apply the pulse field which is on resonance with the magnetic moment . when we read a 1/2 spin as a two - level system , we can apply eq.([eqn:4 ] ) to the electric interaction for optical transition as well as to the magnetic interaction .",
    "let us focus on the time evolution of a pair of spins which are maximally entangled at an initial time as @xmath25 .",
    "we assume the boson bath to be in the vacuum state at an initial time and an coupling function to be a gaussian distribution with the mean frequency @xmath26 and the variance @xmath27 as , @xmath28 where @xmath29 means the average number of bosons interacting with a spin .",
    "we obtain the time evolution of concurrence under @xmath30 times @xmath12 pulse application with pulse interval @xmath31 as , @xmath32 \\label{eqn:11}\\ ] ] where @xmath33      next , we consider the individual bath case where each spin individually interacts with its own boson reservoir as @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of boson reservoir with which the @xmath9-th spin interacts . in eq.([eqn:13",
    "] ) , @xmath37 indicates the frequency of the @xmath19-th boson of the @xmath9-th bath .",
    "@xmath38 is the coupling strength between the @xmath9-th spin and the @xmath19-th boson .    using the same initial condition for the spin state and boson bath as the common bath case",
    ", we obtain the time evolution of concurrence in the form as , @xmath39 , \\label{eqn:14}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is given by replacing suffixes @xmath19 in eq.([eqn:12 ] ) with @xmath41 .",
    "when we set the same coupling function for two baths , @xmath42 for individual bath case is a half of that in the common bath case in eq.([eqn:11 ] ) .",
    "this means that the qualitatively the same effect of a @xmath12 pulse train is observed for the individual bath case .",
    "using a scaled time variable @xmath43 , we show the time dependence of the concurrence @xmath44 in fig.[fig : fg2 ] , where the parameters are set as @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "figs.[fig : fg2](a),[fig : fg2](b),and [ fig : fg2](c ) correspond to the common bath case , and figs.[fig : fg2](d),[fig : fg2](e ) , and [ fig : fg2](f ) correspond to the individual bath case .",
    "figures [ fig : fg2](a ) and [ fig : fg2](d ) show the case without pulse application , where we see a damped oscillation whose mean period is @xmath47 in the scaled time .",
    "we can see that the decay of concurrence in the common bath case ( fig.[fig : fg2](a ) ) is faster than that in the individual bath case(fig.[fig : fg2](d ) ) .",
    "this arises from the difference of coefficients in the exponents of eq.([eqn:11 ] ) and eq.([eqn:14 ] ) .",
    "next , we show the effects of a @xmath12 pulse train with a relatively short interval @xmath48 in figs . [",
    "fig : fg2](b ) and [ fig : fg2](e ) .",
    "one can see that the decay of concurrence shows oscillation and approaches to a constant value .",
    "this result clearly indicates that the degradation of concurrence is effectively suppressed by the application of @xmath12 pulse train for both the common and individual bath case .",
    "while the degree of suppression decreases as increasing the pulse interval to @xmath49 , the concurrence periodically recovers by synchronizing the pulse interval to the oscillation period corresponding to the center frequency of the coupling function by setting @xmath50 as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fg2](c ) for common bath case and [ fig : fg2](f ) for individual bath case .     for @xmath51 , @xmath46 .",
    "figures ( a),(b ) , and ( c ) correspond to the common bath case , and figures ( d),(e ) , and ( f ) correspond to the individual bath case .",
    "( a ) and ( d ) show the case without pulse application ; ( b ) and ( e ) for pulse interval @xmath52 ; ( c ) and ( f ) for @xmath50 ]",
    "focusing on the time evolution of concurrence , we have shown that the multi pulse application can suppress the degradation of the quantum entanglement in the individual bath case as well as the common bath case .",
    "we found that the non - markovian nature of bath plays an essential role to determine the effectiveness of the multi pulse control .",
