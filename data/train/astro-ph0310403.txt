    "the be / x - ray binaries represent the largest subclass of high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "these systems consist of a neutron star and a be star with a cool equatorial disk .",
    "the orbit is wide and usually eccentric .",
    "most of the be / x - ray binaries show only transient activity in the x - ray emission .",
    "these outbursts result from the transient accretion onto the neutron star from the circumsteller matter of the be star . in this paper",
    ", we simulate the accretion flow around the neutron star in be / x - ray binaries , using a 3d sph code ( bate et al .",
    "1995 ) and the mass - transfer rate from the be - star disk obtained by okazaki et al .",
    "in be / x - ray binaries , the mass - transfer rate has strong phase dependence ( okazaki et al .",
    "therefore , the structure of an accretion disk formed around the neutron star in these systems is also likely to be strongly phase dependent .",
    "figure 1 gives the radial disk structures and the snapshots of a developed accretion disk around the neutron star for @xmath2 . from the figure",
    ", we note that the material transferred from the be - star disk to the neutron star forms a non - steady accretion disk around the neutron star .",
    "it is noted from the upper panels that the disk is nearly keplerian at any phase and the accretion flow is highly subsonic except in the outermost part for a short period of time when the material of the be - star disk is transferred to the neutron star .",
    "the disk shrinks at periastron passage by a negative torque exerted by the be star .",
    "in addition , the ram pressure of the supersonic infall of matter captured by the neutron star around periastron enhances the density in the outermost part of the accretion disk , making the disk outer edge sharp .",
    "afterwards , the disk restores its radius by the viscous diffusion .",
    "thus , our simulation confirms that the strucutre of the accretion disk in be / x - ray binaries has a strong dependence on the orbital phase ."
