    "double polarization measurements for @xmath5 and k meson photo productions with a polarized target and a polarized photon beam are a sensitive means to investigate hadron structures , such as an @xmath6-quark content of nucleons @xcite and reaction mechanisms @xcite . in order to measure such `` complete polarization observables '' , an essential key technology is to prepare a polarized target with a long relaxation time .",
    "we have been developing a frozen - spin polarized hydrogen - deuterium ( hd ) target on the basis of a new technologies in cryogenics , superconducting magnet , and hd gas purification .",
    "these developments would lead us to the next upgrades of the leps experiments @xcite .",
    "an idea for making the frozen - spin polarized hd target came from the work in refs .",
    "it is suggested that the hd molecule can be used as a frozen spin polarized target @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted for a long time to realize the polarized hd target at syracuse @xcite , bnl @xcite , and orsay @xcite .",
    "recently , the hd target has been firstly used for the actual experiment at legs @xcite , and will be used at jlab @xcite and at spring-8 @xcite in near future .    in order to prepare the frozen - spin polarized hd target ,",
    "honig @xcite has applied an innovative idea that the hd polarization gradually grows up by the spin - flip process between hd molecules and a small amount of ortho - h@xmath0 ( o - h@xmath0 ) with spin j=1 , whose aspect was many year ago suggested by motizuki _",
    "meanwhile after a long period of cooling , o - h@xmath0 molecules are converted to para - h@xmath0 ( p - h@xmath0 ) with spin j=0 .",
    "if all the o - h@xmath0 molecules are converted to the p - h@xmath0 in the hd target , the relaxation time of hydrogen polarization becomes very long even at a temperature higher than 4 k. after an aging process for 2 - 3 months , the long relaxation time is expected with a hydrogen polarization higher than 84% .",
    "the polarization degree is measured by using the nmr method  @xcite . in the conversion process from o - h@xmath0 to p - h@xmath0 ,",
    "an important parameter is a quantity of remaining o - h@xmath0 with j=1 , which acts as a mediator for spin depolarization when the temperature of the solid hd target rises up to more than 4 k : the lower the impurity of o - h@xmath0 , the longer the relaxation time of hydrogen .",
    "thus , it is essential to control the admixture of the o - h@xmath0 in the highly purified hd gas .",
    "when the hd gas is kept in the gas container for a long time , the quality of the hd gas is deteriorated due to the dissociation process , 2hd @xmath7 h@xmath0 + d@xmath0 and the h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 gasses are naturally yielded . for the hd purification",
    ", we installed a distillation still to make the pure hd gas with a purification level of 99.99% .",
    "the next indispensable problem to be solved is how to measure the small admixtures of o - h@xmath0 , p - h@xmath0 , and d@xmath0 in the hd gas .",
    "the conventional method is to use the quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) for gas analysis .",
    "this instrument makes use of a principle that the analyzed gas is ionized at an ion source by electron bombardment and ions are mass - separated according to the mass / charge ratio ( u / e ) . when the huge hd gas is entered in the ion source of the qms , small amounts of h@xmath2 and d@xmath2 are produced from hd molecules .",
    "other ions of h@xmath8 , [ h@xmath0d]@xmath2 , [ hd@xmath0]@xmath2 , and d@xmath8 are also produced by recombination .",
    "this means that d@xmath2 and [ h@xmath0d]@xmath2 are misidentified as h@xmath10 and d@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the qms can not distinguish the molecules and fragments with a same mass / charge ratio .",
    "we call this problem as `` fragmentation problem '' .",
    "the fragments produced by ionization are listed in table  [ table : fragmentations.table ] .",
    ".the isomers in the hd gas and expected fragments . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : ontail - v2.eps ] , a d@xmath0 peak in gas chromatogram with 4 u / e , measured by using the gas chromatography and qms , is compared with another small d@xmath0 peak in the gas chromatogram , measured by using the gas chromatography only . the d@xmath0 peak is clearly observed with a good s / n ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig : ontail - v2.eps](a ) .",
    "however , it is very difficult to find the small d@xmath0 peak because of the large background from the tail of the hd peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : ontail - v2.eps](b ) .",
    "the s / n ratio for the d@xmath0 peak was improved by a factor of 10 in the measurements by using both the gc and the qms .",
    "we have developed a new hd gas analyzer system by combining the gas chromatography and the quadrupole mass spectrometer for producing the polarized hd target to be used for the hadron photoproduction experiments at spring-8 .",
    "the new system enabled us to observe p - h@xmath0 , o - h@xmath0 , hd , and d@xmath0 separately .",
    "we succeeded in measuring small concentrations ( @xmath10.01% ) of p - h@xmath0 , o - h@xmath0 , and d@xmath0 in the distilled hd gas with good s / n ratios .",
    "recently , another effort to measure the small concentrations of the p - h@xmath0 , o - h@xmath0 , and d@xmath0 in the hd gas is devoted at jlab  @xcite .",
    "the jlab group is trying to analyze the hd gas by using the raman scattering of laser light .",
    "the accuracy of measuring the concentrations will be improved by introducing the raman spectroscopy although the setup is awfully complicate .",
    "it should be noted that the developments of gas analyzing techniques reported in the present work will play an important role in producing the polarized hd target under a well defined hd gas condition .",
    "the present work is supported in part by the ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan and by the national science council of republic of china ( taiwan ) .",
