    "<S> quantum effects in metal nanoparticles driven by a resonant optical field play an important role in inducing a strong nonlinear response , as was recently shown  @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we consider the nonlinear resonant interaction of ultrashort optical pulses with metal nanoparticles distributed uniformly in a host medium . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict to the case of composite materials for which the resonance frequencies of the host medium are well separated from those of the nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> examples include silver or gold spherical or spheroidal nanoparticles embedded in sio@xmath0 . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the plasmonic resonance frequencies are in the visible part of the spectrum while the resonance of the host is in the ultraviolet . </S>",
    "<S> light interaction with metal nanoparticles can be described by a system consisting of maxwell s equations for the electric field , and an oscillator equation describing the displacement of conduction electrons in the metal nanoparticles from equilibrium ( plasmonic oscillations ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nanoparticles are much smaller than the optical carrier wavelength @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows light scattering and spatial effects in the nanoparticles to be neglected . as shown by rautian @xcite and drachev , et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who further developed the earlier work by hache , et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the response of the conduction electrons in the metal nanoparticles to an external electric field induces a leading - order cubic nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of the electric field with plasmonic oscillations in nanoparticles with resonance frequency @xmath2 in the presence of this cubic nonlinearity can be described by the forced duffing equation @xmath3 in this expression @xmath4 represents plasmon displacement from equilibrium , @xmath5 is time , @xmath6 is the coefficient of nonlinearity , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electron charge and rest mass , respectively , and @xmath9 is the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the tilde is used to denote rapidly - varying quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear coefficient @xmath6 can be estimated by comparing the off - resonance nonlinear response in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ duffing ] ) with the drude nonlinearity for ( non - resonant ) conduction electrons in metal nanoparticles . that susceptibility is characterized by @xcite @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the radius of the nanoparticle and the conduction electron density of the metal , respectively , and @xmath13 is the optical carrier frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the estimate @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in pulse dynamics which vary on a much slower scale than the plasmonic , host atom , and carrier wave oscillations , and can be described using a slowly - varying envelope approximation . in this approximation , </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ duffing ] ) becomes @xmath15 where the slowly - varying envelopes of the electric field and plasmonic oscillations are represented by @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the equation for the electric field envelope is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the propagation coordinate , @xmath20 is group velocity , @xmath21 is the speed of light , @xmath22 is the refractive index evaluated at the carrier frequency @xmath13 , @xmath23 is the product of the conduction electron density @xmath12 and the metal filling factor @xmath24 ( the fraction of the composite occupied by metal ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 is the concentration of host atoms , @xmath26 is the projection of the dipole matrix element in the direction of the electric field polarization , and @xmath27 is detuning from the resonance frequency of host atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the last two terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxwell ] ) represent corrections to the refractive index and group index due to the off - resonance interaction with the host medium , which , for illustration , is considered as an ensemble of two - level atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this equation is derived from the maxwell - bloch equations in the non - resonant case by considering @xmath28 as a large parameter and applying the adiabatic following approximation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additional resonances would produce similar terms . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case where optical pulse intensity and duration as well as composite material parameters are such that the characteristic length of resonant light interaction with plasmonic oscillations is much smaller than the characteristic lengths for both group velocity dispersion and nonlinearity induced by the host medium . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the terms representing these effects are omitted from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxwell ] ) .    in a composite material , </S>",
    "<S> the sizes and shapes of metal nanoparticles vary due to limited fabrication tolerances . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the plasmon resonance in spherical metal nanoparticles depends weakly on size in the range between 10 and 50 nm @xcite , so that variations in size are not important . </S>",

    "<S> these solutions are parameterized by velocity @xmath47 , frequency @xmath48 , phase shift @xmath49 , and position @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity @xmath47 is the amount by which the wave is slowed from the copropagating frame velocity @xmath34 . </S>",

    "<S> this choice of parameters provides relatively simple mathematical expressions for the solitary waves . in practice </S>",
    "<S> it is easier to both control and measure peak amplitude , @xmath55 than the pulse velocity , therefore @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 form a more suitable set of parameters . given the pulse amplitude @xmath56 , the corresponding velocity parameter depends on the value of the quantity @xmath58 . if @xmath59 , then @xmath60 trivially . </S>",
    "<S> for the case when @xmath61 , write the amplitude as @xmath62 , where the parameter @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> then defining @xmath64 leads to an expression for the rescaled velocity @xmath65 , where @xmath66^{1/2}$ ] . in this calculation , </S>",
    "<S> the appropriate branches have been chosen so that the expressions are consistent with reality and positivity conditions on the parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> in optics it has become standard practice to refer to certain solutions of nonintegrable systems as solitons . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are characterized as solitary waves which are robust to external perturbations including collisions with other solitary waves . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , arbitrary initial data for these  soliton \" supporting systems tends to evolve into a sum of solitary waves and continuous radiation . </S>",

    "<S> [ f1]a the initial condition @xmath67 simply evolves into continuous radiation , while in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1]b the initial condition @xmath68 emits some radiation but also achieves energy confinement and persists as a soliton . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is similar to the self - induced transparency exhibited by the maxwell - bloch equations  @xcite which describe optical pulse interaction with resonant two - level media . as the amplitude of the initial pulse </S>",
    "<S> is increased , the pulse splits into two [ illustrated in fig  [ f2]a for the initial condition @xmath69 or more solitons and emits continuous radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows a comparison between the numerics and the analytic form of the solitary waves of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ solutions ] ) . the velocity and frequency of the solitary waves are obtained from measurements of their amplitudes and half widths in our simulation . </S>",

    "<S> , the output soliton amplitude also increases until a bifurcation occurs and a new soliton emerges . increasing the input pulse amplitude further results in the production of more solitons , along with continuous radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> two simulations illustrating collision dynamics are presented in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> the other initial soliton parameters are @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the soliton phenomena described above occurs at light intensities such that the dimensionless field amplitude @xmath80 is at least of order one . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity at which @xmath80 is order one estimated as @xmath81 . for the particle radius @xmath82 nm and the carrier wavelength @xmath83 nm , this results in light intensity of @xmath84gw/@xmath85 which can be easily obtained with ultrashort laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the optical pulse durations for which this model is valid are limited by the condition @xmath86 , ( the spectral width of the pulse must be much smaller than the carrier frequency ) required by the slowly varying envelope approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse duration should also be much shorter than the characteristic plasmonic oscillation damping time , which is determined by the time required for electron thermalization in the metal nanoparticles ( @xmath87400fs  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the envelope approximation is appropriate for pulses with width @xmath88fs .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> a family of solitary wave solutions is derived in the envelope approximation for the maxwell wave and duffing oscillator equations , showing that energy confinement is possible for resonant optical pulse interaction with plasmonic oscillations in metal nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the existence condition for these solutions is presented . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations show that stable solitary waves evolve from arbitrarily - shaped initial pulses with sufficient amplitudes and exhibit behavior analogous to self - induced transparency in maxwell - bloch . </S>",
