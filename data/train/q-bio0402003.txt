    "@xcite found power law in school - size distributions of tropical tuna .",
    "the power - law distributions of school sizes are quite general for pelagic fishes @xcite , and quantitative analyses are now in progress ( bonabeau et al . , 1998 , 1999 ; niwa , 2003 ) .    a model of school aggregation proposed by @xcite",
    "is based on a physical model of particle aggregation , i.e. open systems showing power - law cluster - size distributions @xcite .",
    "bonabeau and dagorn s ( 1995 ) model is briefly sketched as follows .",
    "simulated fish schools move between sites on coarse - grained zones of space , and aggregate when they meet .",
    "school splitting is replaced by ( re)injection process : a certain fraction of each school is separated from the school ; the fish that have left their school are reinjected as individuals ( i.e. one - sized schools ) into the system , while the total number of individuals is kept fixed .",
    "@xcite obtained a truncated power law with exponent @xmath0 in the mean - field case of the model , in which schools can move from any site to any other site .",
    "the mean - field assumption might not always be adequate , because there are spatial constraints on movement .",
    "although the ocean is three - dimensional , fish may not fully use their spatial environment .",
    "pelagic fish movement generally takes place in a horizontal ( two - dimensional ) space .",
    "they are limited in depth by physiological constraints , and do not dive into the deeps .",
    "additionally , pelagic fish schools are concentrated in the vicinity of the front which is the contact zone and collision line of two oceanic currents @xcite .",
    "for instance , skipjack schools , _ euthynnus vagans _ ( lesson ) , aggregate in the interfacial region between the cold subarctic and warm subtropic waters @xcite .",
    "they are constrained to move effectively in a one - dimensional space . in the presence of a fish aggregating device ( fad ) , which is a drifting log or an artificial device designed to attract fish ,",
    "pelagic fish do not make full use of the three - dimensional oceanic space and are concentrated in the vicinity of a fad ( a point ) , so that the space dimension effectively decreases to less than one .",
    "bonabeau et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 ) predicted spatial effects , i.e. the dimensional reduction that the power - law exponent of fish school - size distributions is modified from the mean - field case of their model when the dimension of the space is taken into account : the absolute value of the exponent , in a version of their model on a @xmath1-dimensional lattice ( schools hop to neighboring sites only ) , decreases when the space dimension @xmath1 decreases .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed some existing data for various species in terms of a school - size histogram of the population of fish .",
    "@xmath2 fish swimming together form an @xmath2-sized school .",
    "the school - size distribution @xmath3 is proportional to the observed number of @xmath2-sized schools ; the size histogram of the population is then represented by @xmath4 , which is proportional to the fraction of fish in @xmath2-sized schools to total population .",
    "he reported that the distribution @xmath5 is an exponentially thin - tailed distribution , and , the distribution @xmath6 follows a power - law decay with exponent @xmath7 and is truncated at a cut - off size .",
    "a simple stochastic - differential - equation model was proposed to explain the observed power - law behavior , and the predictions of the model were found to be consistent with empirical data .",
    "a remarkable feature is `` scaling '' : all the empirical distributions collapse onto a single curve if the data are plotted in terms of scaled coordinates with the mean value of a histogram @xmath8 , for all various species and for all environmental factors including the above mentioned space dimension .",
    "note that the power - law distribution @xmath6 does not have a well - defined mean ; contrary the rapidly decreasing distribution @xmath5 has a well - defined mean .",
    "the empirically determined power - law exponents of school - size distributions for specific data sets range from 0.7 to 1.8 ( niwa , 1998 ; bonabeau et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "fat - tailed school - size distributions are necessarily truncated because the population is finite .",
    "this truncation of the power - law regime might lead to a `` wrong '' estimation of the exponent .",
    "i make use of the data collapse to extract the `` right '' exponent .",
    "i here propose a finite - size scaling ( fss ) form @xcite for the size distribution @xmath3 on the assumption that the distribution decays with the truncated power - law form with biologically universal exponent .",
    "the power - law exponent of distribution @xmath6 is determined by experimentally fitting the fss relation to achieve the best data collapse .",
    "it is investigated by simulating the school system of pelagic fish whether or not the dimension of the space in which fish swim is relevant to the power - law exponent .",
    "fss for fish school sizes is elucidated through the competition between two processes in the interacting school system : aggregation and splitting of schools .",
    "in addition , it is numerically investigated how long a school stays together , i.e. neither merges with any other schools nor breaks up .",
    "the behavioral algorithms governing school formation and dynamics have been extensively studied [ e.g. @xcite and references cited therein ] .",
    "studies of the integrity of schools , however , are very few [ e.g. @xcite or @xcite for experimental studies ; @xcite for a modeling approach ] . numerical simulations of fish - school aggregation suggest conjectures about real situations that could be tested by observations .",

    "the ways of estimating school sizes of pelagic fishes were catch per set by a purse seine or acoustic surveys .",
    "catch - per - set data are expressed in school weight ( in metric tons ) .",
    "acoustic - survey data are expressed in dimensional size of a school ( e.g. vertical thickness in meters ) , which can be reduced to the biomass in a school : the school biomass is proportional to the vertical cross - section , the square of vertical thickness , or the square of diameter of a school ( squire , 1978 ; anderson , 1981 ; misund , 1993 ; niwa , 1995 ; misund and coetzee , 2000 ) .",

    "for instance , the following normalization is appropriate for the scaling analysis of school based data : @xmath174 the fss form of eq.([fss ] ) then suggests that the linear dependence of @xmath42 on the population size gives @xmath175 . by arguments discussed below",
    ", the fss form  ( [ fss ] ) expresses the unified scaling law for school sizes .",
    "the scaling behavior of the school - size distribution is described by two independent parameters : the population density @xmath152 and the breakup rate @xmath103 .",
    "one of the important results of the model is that a single parameter @xmath176 is sufficient to describe the scaling behavior , i.e. , the two scaling relations of eqs.(15 ) and  ( 16 ) are unified into eq.([fss ] ) because of eq.(13 ) . to understand the unified scaling law for school sizes , it is essential to see what determines the cut - off size of power law .",
    "the cut - off size is determined by the competition between breakup and coalescence of schools .",
    "the coalescence is regulated by the spatial number - density of schools resulting from a balance of the population density and the breakup rate of schools .",
    "equation  ( 13 ) is then fundamental to unify the two scaling laws  ( 15 ) and  ( 16 ) .",
    "let us trace the size change of the school a certain individual ( named `` a '' ) rides .",
    "let @xmath177 be the coarse - grained density of schools ( i.e. number of schools per site ) , and , @xmath178 the probability for a school to coalesce with other schools per time step ( i.e. coalescence rate ) .",
    "then the expected increment and decrement of the size of `` a''-riding school ( denoted by @xmath179 ) are @xmath180 ( accompanied by a constant factor @xmath181 ) and @xmath182 , respectively , at each time step of coarse - grained simulation [ @xmath183 reads an ( apparent ) average size of fish schools ] .",
    "the expected size - change of `` a''-riding school per time step , @xmath184 , obeys @xmath185 the ratio @xmath186 , therefore , gives the expected size of `` a''-riding school in the stationary state , which is equivalent to the value of @xmath42 by definition .",
    "thus , the fundamental equation  ( 13 ) is approved : @xmath187 where @xmath181 is just a number independent of space dimension , fit giving @xmath188 in the simulations ( fig.[fig:6]a ) .",
    "the values of the ratio of @xmath155 to @xmath189 for one- , two - dimensional , and mean - field cases are estimated at 3.09 , 3.11 , and 3.07 , respectively , which all exhibit the similar value independent of the case of the model .",

    "therefore , the unified scaling law , eq.(20 ) , holds independently of the space dimension : space does not influence a linear power - law behavior with a crossover to an exponential decay around @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] in the next section showing the comparison of the empirical school - size distribution with simulated distributions in one- , two - dimensional , and mean - field cases directly verifies the irrelevance of space in the scaling law for fish school sizes .",
    "the cut - off size in the scaling law results from the ability of a school to maintain its integrity over only a certain amount of time : @xmath42 varies in proportion as the coalescence rate , and inversely as the breakup rate [ see eq.(19 ) ] .",

    "data collapse is a way of establishing the scaling in fish school - size distributions .",

    "it has been found that the scaling law for school sizes of pelagic fish is completely independent of the dimension of the space in which the fish move : the space dimension is irrelevant to the power - law exponent of size distributions .",
    "this result is contrary to common knowledge in physics that the critical exponents characterizing the scaling behavior observed in phase transitions depend on the dimensionality .",
    "the model of school aggregation does not perfectly mirror the interacting school system in the wild ( e.g. the size of a school may be relevant to its breakup probability ) , yet the numerically simulated result conforms almost perfectly to the empirical data .",
    "this is a consequence of universality @xcite .",
    "the scaling law supports the view that the power - law distribution of fish schools is a self - organized critical phenomenon ( bak , 1996 ; jensen , 1998 ) , not merely a reflection of an exponential distribution of population among school sizes , because only critical processes exhibit data - collapse ( yeomans , 1992 ; bak et al . , 2002 , christensen et al . , 2002 ) , known as scaling in critical phenomena . the interacting school system is naturally attracted to the critical value of the spatial number - density of fish schools , without any external adjustment being necessary . in the system",
    "there are two competing processes , coalescence and breakup , and the critical density depends crucially on the interplay between the coalescence and breakup time scales .",
    "if the school density becomes greater ( or less ) than the critical value , this increased ( or decreased ) density in turn increases ( or decreases ) the probability of coalescence , leading to a shift toward less ( or greater ) density until it reverts to the critical value .",
    "the relation between dimensional and social sizes of pelagic fish schools , eq.(1 ) , gives another scaling law for the school size , which is analogous to that used in polymer physics @xcite .",
    "what is universal in this law is the exponent @xmath244 : it is the same for all schools , supposed to be independent of not only environmental conditions but also species .",
    "what is non - universal here is the prefactor .",
    "it depends on the details of interactions between individuals . if we want to understand the properties of schooling configurations , the first step is to explain the existence and the value of the exponent @xmath244 .",
    "the second step is to account for the constant that multiplies @xmath245 , and this involves delicate studies on local properties within a school . in the first stage ,",
    "the school size @xmath2 ( in number or biomass ) must be measured for different values of dimensional size @xmath25 and compare them . finding the exact value of @xmath2 for a given school is not an easy task , whereas acoustic surveys for pelagic species are extensively performed .    by contraries ,",
    "the exponent @xmath244 may be estimated by hypothesizing fss in the school - size distribution of pelagic species .",
    "assume the scaling relation , eq.(1 ) , and choose the suitable value of @xmath244 to achieve the best data - collapse in the fss analysis , while a dimensional size histogram for acoustic - survey data is transformed into a social size histogram by using eq.(2 ) .",
