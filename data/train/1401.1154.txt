    "these mathematical quantities , which remain unchanged under ambient isotopy , are usually represented in the form of polynomials , like for example the alexander @xcite or the homfly polynomials @xcite . alternatively , certain knot invariants may be defined in terms of multiple curvilinear integrals , in which the integrations are performed along the spatial trajectory of the knot or elements of it @xcite . particularly important for applications is the case in which knots are constructed by joining together at their ends a set of @xmath3 segments .",
    "discrete knots of this kind are in fact the most common concrete realizations of knots in numerical simulations .",
    "formally , a discrete knot is @xmath4curve which is piecewise smooth and is characterized by sharp corners at the joints between contiguous segments .",
    "while there exist already well established mathematical algorithms in order to compute numerically polynomial knot invariants , see for instance the pioneering work @xcite , there are not many studies concerning the numerical computation of knot invariants given in the form of multiple line integrals for such discrete knots .",
    "of course , the calculation of line integrals over discrete data is a textbook subject @xcite .",
    "moreover , problems in which knots are discretized using splines , have been investigated for example in @xcite .",
    "however , we are faced with a somewhat different problem , which arises due to the fact that knot invariants expressed as multiple curvilinear integrals are not well defined in the case of discrete knots .",
    "the reason of this failure is related to the presence of the non - smooth corners at the joints between two contiguous segments . as a consequence ,",
    "the main goal pursued here is to replace the piecewise smooth curves representing a discrete knot with more regular ones . to obtain a smoothing algorithm that is able to perform this replacement for general discrete knots without destroying their topology",
    ", a strategy has been adopted that can be briefly summarized as follows .",
    "first , the sharp corners are surrounded with spheres whose radii are chosen in such a way that they do not intersect with themselves and with other elements of the knot .",
    "after that , the elements containing the corners inside the spheres are substituted with arcs of smooth curves .",
    "this procedure transforms the original trajectories into @xmath5curvescurve is a tangent vector geometrically continuous curve characterized by the fact that the unit tangent vector to the curve is continuous @xcite . ] without altering their topological configurations . as an application ,",
    "the case of the vassiliev knot invariant of degree 2  @xcite of a knot @xmath0 , denoted here @xmath1 , is worked out .",
    "the main advantages of choosing this invariant are its relative simplicity and the fact that its exact values for different knots can be computed analytically . in this way , it is possible to perform a comparison between numerical and analytical results . after the smoothing procedure proposed in this work ,",
    "it becomes possible to calculate @xmath1 numerically with an arbitrarily high precision .    despite its simplicity",

    "a monte carlo integration scheme is adopted and explained in details . moreover , several tricks to speed up the computation of @xmath1 , that are specific to particular applications or situations , are presented . since the time for evaluating @xmath1 is sensitive to the number of segments @xmath3 composing the knot , but not on its length , we have provided an algorithm to reduce by a factor three the number of segments without changing the topology of the knot .",
    "this algorithm is valid for knots defined on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "secondly , it is shown that the number of points of the trajectory @xmath0 to be sampled during the monte carlo integration procedure may be considerably decreased when the knot invariant @xmath1 is used in order to detect topology changes that may potentially occur after a random transformation of an element of the trajectory of the knot .",
    "such random transformations , like for instance the pivot moves @xcite , the pull moves @xcite and the bfacf moves @xcite , are extensively exploited in numerical simulations of polymer knots .",

    "is implemented in order to regularize singularities that are possibly arising in some of the terms to be integrated .",
    "while it is analytically proven that the sum of all these terms is always finite , the presence of singularities in single terms may spoil the result of the numerical integration .",
    "a smoothing procedure is presented in section [ section4 ] in order to transform a general discrete knot into a @xmath5curve .",

    "the vassiliev invariant of degree 2 is probably the simplest knot invariant that can be defined in terms of multiple integrals computed along the contour of the knot itself .",
    "for this reason , there are chances that in the future this invariant will play for knots the same role played by the gauss linking number in numerical studies of links formed by ring - shaped quasi one - dimensional objects .",
    "a suitable parametrization of discrete knots has been introduced , see eqs .",
    "( [ equ11][xsdefadd ] ) and the problem of computing the multiple contour integrals has been tackled using the monte carlo integration scheme summarized by the general equation ( [ mcf ] ) . in principle , using the scale invariance of @xmath1 , it is possible to reduce arbitrarily the length of the knot , because a change of scale does not alter its topology . however , even in the best case in which the lengths of the segments become infinitesimal , so that the integration over them can be easily approximated , standard methods require the computation of a sum over @xmath325 terms in order to obtain the value of @xmath1 , as shown in @xcite and in the previous section . with the monte carlo integration",
    "a considerably smaller number of samples is necessary in order to evaluate @xmath1 with a satisfactory approximation . for this reason ,",
    "the standard integration methods like the simpson s rule are decidedly slower as it is pointed out by the example provided at the beginning of section [ section5 ] of a knot with @xmath326 segments .",
    "further refinements of the naive monte carlo integration scheme presented in section [ section3 ] are difficult to be implemented or do not increase substantially the speed of the computations .",
    "for instance , the division of the integration domain , which is recommended as one of the strategies to improve the sampling efficiency , did not lead to significant improvements . on the other side , it is not easy to guess which distribution of the values of the integration variables could be suitable in order to enhance the sampling procedure .    in the computations of @xmath1 for discrete knots consisting of a set of segments , we have found that the results never coincide with the analytical values .",
    "this is expected because of the sharp corners at the points where the segments join together .",
    "there is some correlation between the number of these corners and the systematic error in the evaluation of @xmath1 that apparently depends on the type of the knot and the number of its segments @xmath3 .",
    "however , to establish a general relation between that systematic error and @xmath3 which could be valid for every knot has not been possible . to solve the problem of the sharp corners , a procedure for the smoothing of discrete knots has been presented in section [ section4 ] .",
    "this procedure transforms the discrete knot into a @xmath5curve . after the smoothing",
    ", it has been possible to evaluate @xmath1 with an arbitrary precision by gradually increasing the number of samples used in the monte carlo integration of the multiple integrals entering the definition of @xmath1 , see for example table  [ table2 ] . despite the advantages of the adopted monte carlo method with respect to the traditional integration techniques ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath1 becomes challenging when the number of segments composing the knot is large . for certain physical applications of the knot invariant @xmath1 ,",
    "we show that the time necessary for its evaluation , which approximately scales as the fourth power of @xmath3 when @xmath3 is large , can be reduced in such a way that scales with the third power of @xmath3 , see eq .",
    "( [ 53 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we present an algorithm to reduce the number of segments of a knot defined on a cubic lattice by a factor three without changing the topology . after this reduction ,",
    "the knot is no longer defined on a lattice , but still the general smoothing procedure of section [ section4 ] and the provided monte carlo integration scheme of section [ section3 ] can be applied in order to obtain the value of @xmath1 . to give an idea of the efficiency of the methods for reducing the number of segments explained in section [ section5 ] , in the case of a knot with @xmath327 originally constructed on a simple cubic lattice , the number of segments in the final configuration obtained after the treatment ranges between 255 and 300 depending on the initial shape of the knot . finally , it is important to notice that , in order to distinguish the topology of different knots , it is not necessary to achieve a standard deviation that is lower than the threshold value given in eq .",
    "( [ varcond ] ) . in this case ,",
    "in fact , the probability that one knot could be confused with a topologically inequivalent one due to statistical errors is very small , of the order of @xmath328 .",
    "work is in progress in order to generalize the methods presented in this work to the case of the triple invariant of milnor that describes the links formed by three knots .      to compute the nearest point @xmath329 of a segment @xmath330 from the vertex @xmath109",
    ", we pick up on @xmath331 a general point @xmath332 as follows : @xmath333 with @xmath334 $ ] .",
    "the distance between this point and @xmath109 is @xmath335 .",
    "if @xmath332 is the nearest point to @xmath109 , then it satisfies the condition @xmath336 inserting eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) in ( [ d2 ] ) and solving eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) with respect to @xmath286 , we obtain that the point of @xmath331 at the minimal distance from @xmath109 corresponds to the following value of @xmath286 : @xmath337 three cases may occur :    * if @xmath338 , this means that the nearest point occurs on a line having the same direction of @xmath331 at a distance @xmath338 from the point @xmath230 .",
    "this means that the nearest point to @xmath109 on the segment @xmath331 is @xmath339 and its distance from @xmath109 is @xmath340 .",
