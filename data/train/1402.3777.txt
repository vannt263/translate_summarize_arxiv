    "to formulate the problem in proper perspective , we at first present results of two atoms , which are interacting with each other via dipole - dipole interaction as well as an external electromagnetic field . the atomic response to this field is significantly altered by the dipole - dipole interaction , as shown below .",
    "the energy levels of both atoms together can be represented in the combined hilbert space of four energy levels as shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "the state @xmath3 represents state when both atoms are in ground state ( @xmath4 ) , state @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent states when either one of the atoms are excited while the other is still in ground state ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and the state @xmath9 corresponds to the situation when both the atoms are in excited state ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is modelled as a coupling factor ` g ' which brings about non - radiative transitions between @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "the appropriate hamiltonian for this system would be    @xmath13    which will be used to solve the liouville equation @xmath14 + \\mathcal{l } \\rho \\label{liouville}\\ ] ]    the first term on the right hand side represents the interaction with the radiation field and the dipole - dipole interaction whereas the second term ( the liouvillean ) accounts for different decay mechanisms .    the resulting 16 equations , are reduced to 15 by using the completeness condition @xmath15 , and rewritten in the form    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a @xmath18 coefficient matrix and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are column vectors each of length 15 which are defined in the following .",
    "@xmath21^t \\\\   & \\phi    = [ 0~ 0~ 0~ 0~ 0~   2\\gamma_{42}~ 0~ i \\alpha^{*}_{42}~ 0~ 0~ 2\\gamma_{43}~ i\\alpha^{*}_{43}~ 0~ -i   \\alpha_{42}~ -i\\alpha_{43}]^t .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the steady state solution of the density matrix elements may be obtained by numerically solving for @xmath22    the detailed results of this system is presented elsewhere @xcite , but will be recalled here for the sake of completeness",
    ".    figures ( [ fig : subfig1 ] - [ fig : subfig4 ] ) show populations of the levels @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 respectively in clockwise direction .",
    "they are therefore populations of the coupled two - atom levels @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it can be seen that at @xmath27 , the two atoms are independent of each other and hence the steady state population of both ground and excited states of both the atoms have a probability of @xmath28 . therefore , the probabilities of each level in the combined hilbert space , will be product of these probabilities , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "as the coupling strength between the atoms increases , the energies of levels @xmath5 and @xmath6 undergo a shift and hence their populations show a sideband at the appropriate detuning @xmath30",
    ". however this sideband is absent in the population of level @xmath9 , indicating  dipole blockade \" wherein , once one of the atoms is excited while the other is still in ground state ( either @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) , it prevents the other atom getting excited .",
    "this can also be seen as a result of destructive interference between the pathways @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "nevertheless , a condition of both atoms simultaneously getting excited ( bypassing levels @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) exists as indicated by the small peak of population of @xmath9 .",
    "the height of this peak reduces as a function of @xmath1 , indicating a strong dependency on the coupling factor .",
    "when more than two atoms are involved , each atom interacts with all the others , further complicating the system .",
    "however , one can make a simple extension , assuming that the atoms are located on equidistant lattice sites and only the nearest neighbour interaction is dominant .",
    "the interaction with the other neighbouring atoms can be neglected .",
    "it can be understood that the effect of g between any two neighbouring atoms is same as shown earlier .",
    "however the combined result of the three - atom system is definitely different , as shown in the next section .",
    "the above arguments will now be extended to three atoms , with bipartite d - d interactions .",
    "there are two configurations in which the three atoms may be arranged . in the first of these ,",
    "the atoms are arranged in a linear array , in which case d - d interactions exist between atoms 1 and 2 , between atoms 2 and 3 , but no interaction exists between atoms 3 and 1 .",
    "the second arrangement is in the form of a closed loop , where each of the three atoms interacts with its neighbours .",
    "the behaviour of the open - loop ( linear ) case is different from that of the closed loop .",
    "the two configurations are shown in figure [ loopandline ] .",
    "the energy levels in the combined space will form a system of eight energy levels , as shown in figure [ eight_levels ] .",
    "energy level labelled @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath33 where all three atoms are in ground state .",
    "the three levels wherein any one of the three atoms are excited are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are all degenerate and are denoted respectively as @xmath36 and @xmath9 .",
    "the three levels with two atoms in excited state and one in ground state are @xmath37 and @xmath38 and are denoted @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "finally the state with all three atoms excited is @xmath41 is denoted @xmath42 .",
    "figure [ eight_levels ] also indicates the relevant laser couplings ( blue arrows online ) between the levels .",
    "this energy level scheme is same for both open loop and closed loop arrangements , except that for the open loop @xmath43 , indicating that there is no dipole dipole interaction between atom 1 and atom 3 .",
    "the hamiltonian , including both laser coupling as well as the d - d coupling between different levels is given by @xmath44 in units of @xmath45 , with the usual notations .",
    "for the open - loop ( single line ) configuration , the dipole coupling parameters @xmath46 and for the closed loop configuration , all the @xmath47s are nonzero . as a simplest case scenario ,",
    "all the non zero dipole - dipole coupling factors @xmath47 both for the open loop and closed loop configurations are taken to be equal for computing the dynamics of the system . the liouville equation for the density operator [ [ liouville ] ] , governing the dynamics of the system",
    ", will give rise to sixty four coupled first order differential equations . as is the usual practice , introducing the completeness condition @xmath48 and eliminating one of the populations , say @xmath49 in this study , results in a set of sixty three coupled equations , which are solved in steady state using same idea as outlined in the two - atom case .",
    "intuitively , it can be noticed that the dipole - dipole interaction in case of closed loop configuration is identical among all the atom pairs .",
    "whereas , in the open loop configuration , the atom in the middle ( atom 2 ) is interacting with two neighbours ( 1 and 3 ) whereas atoms 1 and 3 are interacting with only one neighbour(atom 2 ) .",
    "this lack of equivalence introduces difference in the behaviour of this system as compared to the closed loop system .",
    "the results presented are clearly indicative of this behaviour .",
    "the figures ( [ loop_populations1 ] ) show plot of populations @xmath50 to @xmath49 , for the closed loop configuration for different values of g.       to @xmath9 for the loop configuration , for values of g=0 ( blue curve ) , g=5 ( green curve ) and g=10 ( red curve ) ( colors online ) .",
    "all curves for rabi frequency @xmath51    when @xmath27 , @xmath50 shows a single dip at @xmath52",
    ". however , the single excited atom case  @xmath53 show two small peaks , instead of a single corresponding peak .",
    "the dip at the center can not be attributed to dipole blockade since at this point @xmath27 .",
    "instead , it has to be attributed to a loss of population to higher states , where more than one atom is excited .",
    "this is evident by the single peak structure seen in the populations @xmath54 .",
    "unlike the two atom case , where all the populations were equal , it can be noticed that the system of three identical atoms shows different behaviour .",
    "individual probabilities for getting any one of the atoms in the excited state ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) is equal to 0.14 , which adds up to nearly a half of the probability for the three one - atom - excited states . on the other hand , the case of any two of the atoms excited",
    "is much lower , adding upto 0.24 for all the three states @xmath55 combined together .",
    "probability for having all three atoms excited together is even smaller , which is about 0.08 approximately .",
    "presence of @xmath1 affects the above situation in an interesting way .",
    "the dip for @xmath50 splits into two , with both the lobes shifted to red side of the resonance .",
    "this indicates that @xmath1 causes a mixing of the energy levels in such a way to create two superpositions , both shifted closer to each other .",
    "the two lobes also have asymmetric widths , with the extreme one becoming broader and stronger as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this behaviour is exactly mirrored by the two peaks for one - atom excited state @xmath53 .",
    "on the other hand , the two - excited - atoms state does not exhibit a clear two - lobed structure .",
    "it shows a dominant single peak , which is matched at the resonance to the narrower peak of the one - excited - atom case . for moderate @xmath1 s ,",
    "a small bump can be seen at @xmath52 .",
    "this is most likely the population that has decayed from level @xmath42 , which has a peak at @xmath52 .",
    "level @xmath42 , which corresponds to all three atoms in excited state has only a sharp peak at the center , with no sidebands .",
    "the central peak too decreases drastically in height with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the presence of dipole blockade in the case of three atoms , wherein the excited atoms prevent other atoms from getting excited .",
    "presence of the third atom indicates that the two - atom dipole blockade is not very effective , once at least one of the atoms is excited .",
    "intuitively , one can then explain the two peaks of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and a single sideband of @xmath58 and @xmath59 as follows - the energy shift due to @xmath1 causes two resonances for atomic excitation - leading to any one of the three atoms to reach their respective excited states .",
    "once excited , the atom is preventing one of its neighbours from getting excited , which can be attributed to absence of the broad peak in the populations .",
    "however , the third atom is not affected drastically by this blockade and gets excited . in other words ,",
    "the standard dipole blockade prevents only one of the two atoms from getting excited , resulting in two atoms which can get excited .",
    "imaginary part of coherences , for case of dipole coupled transition , indicate absorption of light .",
    "figure [ first_coherence ] shows these coherences for @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the coherence @xmath60 , which is also same as @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the loop configuration case shows absorption of one photon by one of the atoms to get excited .",
    "the populations @xmath56 and @xmath57 mirror this absorption profile exactly . similarly , population of two - atom excited states @xmath65 and coherences @xmath61 ( which is also equal to @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) mirror each other perfectly .",
    "similarly , @xmath62 ( = @xmath68 ) and the population term @xmath49 mirror each other .    ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 as labelled . for the loop configuration , @xmath69 .",
    "coherence @xmath70 . and @xmath71 .",
    "]     and @xmath72 for loop configuration , width=377,height=151 ]     and @xmath72 for loop configuration , width=377,height=151 ]      open loop configuration [ loopandline ] , shows drastically different results . in this configuration ,",
    "we label the state which corresponds to the middle , as @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the dipole - dipole interaction couples states @xmath5 to @xmath6 and @xmath6 and @xmath9 , but there is no coupling between @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , there is no dipole - dipole interaction between states @xmath73 and @xmath40 .",
    "to @xmath9 for the line configuration ]     to @xmath42 for the line configuration ]    , @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the line configuration ]    , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the line configuration ]    2.5 cm    obviously , one expects that the populations @xmath76 and @xmath57 , which are both coupled to the state @xmath6 through the dipole interaction , show identical behaviour while that of @xmath77 differs from these two . for similar reasons one expects that @xmath78 and @xmath59 would be identical with each other , but different from that of @xmath79 .",
    "the graphs shown in figure [ line_populations1 ] and [ line_populations2 ] clearly indicate this expected behaviour .",
    "there are three resonance peaks in absorption , as opposed to two that were present in the loop configuration .",
    "a small bump at the line centre ( @xmath52 ) can be noticed in all the populations , indicating a three photon resonance .",
    "the population @xmath49 , on the other hand , starts with a single peak for @xmath27 , which splits into two as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "the absorption is also strongly suppressed , indicating the presence of dipole blockade .",
    "we have studied dynamics of three identical atoms interacting with each other via dipole - dipole interaction and also an external electromagnetic field .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is represented by a coupling factor ` g ' between an excited atom and an atom in the ground state . considering only nearest neighbour interaction",
    ", we found that the interaction suppresses one of the neighbouring atoms from getting excited but not both .",
    "we have studied two possible scenarios in which the three atoms can be present and the results for both these scenarios show different behaviour .",
    "attempt has been made to explain the differences in behaviour of the system under the two cases .",
    "this study throws light on the general behaviour of the system but further insight can be obtained by refining the study .",
