    "in our search for new phenomena , the lhc is about to start a new era of testing the incredibly successful and resilient standard model . we know",
    "that the standard model can only be an effective theory , likely breaking down around the tev scale .",
    "one of the possible extensions which should appear at that scale is supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite .",
    "its existence would double the particle spectrum , adding a partner of opposite spin statistics for every standard model particle .",
    "if supersymmetry exists , it must be broken , as we do not see spin partners of any standard model particles  @xcite .",
    "all superpartners must therefore be massive compared to their standard model counterparts .",
    "experiments such as lep and tevatron  @xcite have put stringent bounds on many of the susy partner masses . the lhc will perform a conclusive search covering masses all the way to the tev scale . in the existing literature we find thorough coverage of how to conclusively discover susy - like signatures at hadron colliders , primarily via its large production cross sections for the strongly - interacting squarks and gluino  @xcite .",
    "_ however _ , discovery is only the beginning of lhc physics  many alternative scenarios of tev - scale physics can mimic supersymmetry . for a long time",
    "we have known how to confirm the majorana nature of gluinos , provided they are fermions  @xcite ; a similar strategy for majorana neutralinos is still missing .",
    "serious effort has recently been put into studying how to distinguish between classes of models , mostly by measuring the masses  @xcite and spins  @xcite of new particles , mainly in the colored sector .",
    "such spectral data can be used to perform tev - scale model fits , for example if the spins support a susy hypothesis  @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "little work has addressed other quantum number measurements at the lhc .",
    "typical susy spectra show gluino and squarks more massive than the non - colored superpartners , due to different qcd v. electroweak gauge coupling evolution from a unification scale , or directly due to the size of the beta functions of the gauge couplings .",
    "such heavy superpartners cascade decay through through successively lighter superpartners , from colored to colorless , until the cascade terminates at the lightest supersymmetric particle , or lsp , which is the dark matter candidate . a typical ( long ) squark decay radiates first a quark to shed its color charge , and",
    "then two leptons to finally arrive at the lsp .",
    "if the gluino is heavier than the squarks , it will have the same decay chain , plus an extra quark .",
    "while we can accurately measure masses from the decay kinematics in long cascades , we do not gain any information about the coupling strengths of the intermediate states , save that they re large enough to keep the superpartners from being long - lived  but this is not a truly useful constraint . for top quarks ,",
    "the corresponding issue is resolved via single - top production , and the analogous process for stops and sbottoms can establish that the stop - sbottom-@xmath0 boson interaction is an electroweak gauge vertex  @xcite .    our goal is to observe non - colored superpartner production directly at lhc , to test those superpartners electroweak character and study their quantum numbers independently of cascade decays .",
    "while drell - yan production at the lhc is generally lost in the sm and susy backgrounds , a previous work identified weak - boson - fusion production as a potentially viable signal  @xcite .",
    "this channel has been extremely successful in finding ways to study light higgs bosons , including for example the size  @xcite and structure  @xcite of their couplings . in the case of superpartners ,",
    "the probably most pressing question is the dirac or majorana nature of the neutralino sector , which the weak - boson - fusion process will allow us to study .",
    "the production of same - sign charged particles at a hadron collider is in general a remarkable signal .",
    "it requires a balancing of charge in the final state  the initial state may have at most charge @xmath1  which limits it to very few sources .",
    "we will explore each source for same - sign charginos in turn , starting with the electroweak production mechanism found in weak boson fusion  @xcite .    in all tev",
    " scale supersymmetric ( mssm ) scenarios , charginos subsequently decay .",
    "this may be treated as a separate @xmath2 on - shell process , which can be included as a branching ratio or as a fully spin - correlated decay chain ( and similarly for any further decays of the chargino s daughters ) . for simplicity",
    ", we discuss the various processes and their associated feynman diagrams only up to the produced charginos ; their subsequent decay does not alter any of the production mechanisms or topologies .       as described in the text .",

    "this is large enough to make the scattered quarks visible as jets in the detector , albeit at typically small scattering angles , thus far forward and backward in the detector .",
    "particles produced in the fusion process are typically central in the detector , at nearly right angles to the beam axis , and with similarly high transverse momentum .    because charginos are fermions , their same - sign production via gauge boson fusion must be mediated by a @xmath3-channel neutral majorana fermion , to provide the necessary fermion number violation . in the mssm",
    "there are four neutralinos . for each quark - flavor subprocess",

    "the mixing from the susy eigenstates to the mass eigenstates is fairly small . in that sense",

    "we examine this scenario first as a baseline to all others , but will find that backgrounds are generally not a problem even when the chargino can not be reconstructed . in general , we will not focus on the kinematics of the centrally produced charginos  instead , we follow the spirit of a similar higgs - coupling analysis  @xcite and rely on the tagging - jet kinematics to analyze the events .    specifically",
    ", we investigate the benchmark point sps9  @xcite , an anomaly - mediated supersymmetry - breaking scenario with naturally long - lived wino - like charginos @xmath6 .",
    "the lighter chargino has a mass of 197.4  gev and the light - flavor squark masses are 1.3  tev , with a lighter gluino .",
    "gluino production is not a background , because gluinos decay to either a top quark plus stop or bottom quark plus sbottom with a radically different final state which can be easily vetoed .",
    "we emphasize that sps9 is only a toy example to demonstrate the utility of this signature with a minimum of complication .",
    "our analysis is equally valid in any other scenario , provided the production rate for same - sign charginos ( or their decay products after branching ratios ) is sufficient for observation at high luminosity .    for all our calculations we use the event generator madevent4  @xcite with its mssm extension  @xcite .",

    "in addition to an assumed @xmath15 jet veto to remove ( supersymmetric ) heavy - flavor backgrounds , we apply the usual weak - boson - fusion cuts for the tagging jets . on top of those we require minimal cuts for the charginos to satisfy detector requirements for observability and tracking .",
    "we expect these chargino cuts to have a similar effect as cuts on possible chargino decay products .",
    "none of our later results depend in any way on the chargino cuts .",
    "the basic level cuts consist of minimum transverse momentum and maximum absolute rapidity : [ eq : cut - a ] p_t(j ) > 20 gev , |(j)| < 4.5 , p_t(1 ) > 10 gev ,    particle production , namely forward - scattered quark jets with large rapidity separation between them , and central production of the electroweak objects , we impose a jet separation cut and require the colorless objects to lie between the jets  @xcite : [ eq : cut - b ]    an invariant mass cut on all combinations of one jet with one chargino around the known squark mass , which may easily be done for long - lived massive charged particles  @xcite .",
    "we study two more - or - less aggressive versions of this cut , which almost completely removes the qcd and electroweak squark - production backgrounds : [ eq : cut - c ] |m(j,1)-m_u| > 30 ( 50 ) gev .",
    "this cut of course assumes long - lived charged particles .",

    "the qcd and electroweak non - wbf backgrounds are each slightly less than half the size of the signal already after basic wbf cuts .",
    "the excellent ratio @xmath16 is promising , even when the number of signal events is small . in a long - lived chargino scenario",
    "the event may be completely reconstructed , allowing the imposition of an invariant mass cut to remove the squark poles .",
    "if such a rejection cut is possible , the backgrounds become truly negligible .",
    "if the charginos decay , this cut would likely turn into something like a transverse - mass cut with lower efficiency .",
    "moreover , there would be some efficiency loss in selecting leptonic final states , but standard techniques in wbf  @xcite would provide for further significant reduction of the backgrounds .",
    "such generalization is however beyond the scope of this first paper .",
    "given that the efficiency to tag two forward jets as well as the two central charged tracks is collectively about @xmath19  @xcite , our signal requires the full lhc luminosity of 300  fb@xmath20 , especially to obtain good statistics in the kinematic distributions .",
    "wbf production of exotic particles is a natural case for the high - luminosity environment of the slhc  @xcite , when parameter studies will become more and more the focus for the experiments .",
    "however , forward - jet tagging at those luminosities is not yet fully understood , so we limit ourselves to the lhc design luminosity before its planned upgrade . there , we expect a few hundred signal events with high purity  more than enough to perform `` precision '' measurements in kinematic distributions , given negligible backgrounds .",
    "the rate uncertainties would be around @xmath21 statistically , probably with similar systematic uncertainties .",

    "all curves are normalized to unity to emphasize the gross distinguishing characteristics of wbf v. non - wbf electroweak and qcd production .",
    "as noted earlier , the backgrounds arise primarily from heavy squark decays , so they give much harder jets ( and charginos ) for a typical mass separation .",
    "this is also the reason for the backgrounds far larger @xmath23 compared to the wbf continuum signal .",
    "the leading chargino transverse momentum distribution is almost identical to that for the leading tagging jet .",
    "other standard wbf distributions , such as the azimuthal angle between the tagging jets , @xmath24 , are only marginally discriminating .    in a long - lived chargino scenario , all these distributions may be used to suppress the backgrounds to a truly negligible level relative to the signal , as we found in table  [ tab : xsecs ] .",
    "if the chargino instead decayed promptly , then all curves in @xmath23 would shift to the left by some likely universal amount , to account for the unobserved lsp pair .",
    "the point is that while all of these distributions would change , the shifts would be very similar for signal and backgrounds , thus retaining the same basic distinctions and separating power .",
    "only the invariant mass of a chargino plus the leading jet is valid exclusively for long - lived scenarios .",
    "but , as can be seen from the other distributions , obtaining even better @xmath16 ratios achieved with the first level of standard wbf cuts would be straightforward , also with decays .",
    "we thus do not anticipate any serious background issues , at least in scenarios where the squarks are appreciably heavier than the charginos .",
    "for many susy models , @xmath16 will be of order 1/1 from the wbf cuts alone , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cut - a][eq : cut - b ] ) . very little effort would be needed to enhance the signal v. background separation further .",
    "making new physics discoveries at the lhc immediately means facing the arduous task of determining what we actually see .",
    "if we observe same - sign charged particles in weak boson fusion we can not simply assume that they are supersymmetric charginos ; alternative hypotheses must be tested to reach a meaningful conclusion .",
    "we already know that other objects can at first glance appear to be gluinos or squarks  @xcite .",
    "even if heavy colored particle decays were determined to be of the right spin for supersymmetry  @xcite , it can be hard to determine chargino and neutralino candidate spins in cascade decays , not to mention the majorana or dirac nature of such weakly interacting new fermions .",
    "our goal is to show that kinematic distributions can be used to discriminate between fermionic same - sign particle production in wbf , and scalars or vectors .",
    "( we ignore higher - spin states in good taste . )    to formulate our stable - scalar hypothesis , we use the mssm two - higgs doublet model , as implemented in madevent4  @xcite . a general two - higgs doublet model ( also implemented )",
    "could be used as well , but this does not change the spin structure , and in any case we consider only normalized distributions . for the spin hypothesis comparison we assume the charged higgs to be stable on detector timescales due to a near mass degeneracy with its decay products ; it may also decay promptly , and all kinematic distributions alter in a way similar to that described for the fermionic chargino case in sec .  [",
    "sub : svb - kin ] .",
    "for the vector case , we implement a generic model with a neutral @xmath25 and a charged @xmath26 pair .",
    "if done rigorously , this is not entirely straightforward , as we would need to begin with a larger gauge group , such as @xmath27 , and break it to @xmath28 .",
    "we would also have to be careful about any additional matter content , which may be necessary depending on the underlying group structure and the breaking mechanism  @xcite .",
    "since we normalize the scalar and vector cross sections to the fermionic chargino rate and analyze exclusively normalized distributions , we do not worry about such details .",
    "instead , we use a toy model based on an additional little - higgs - type gauge sector @xmath29 with @xmath30 parity , which makes the @xmath26 stable on detector timescales . to preserve unitarity at high energies",
    ", we include a @xmath30-odd scalar @xmath31 and @xmath30-odd heavy quarks @xmath32 , etc .",

    "we verify unitarity conservation in the process @xmath33 . at the lhc",
    ", we find that for unitary wbf @xmath34 production the @xmath30-odd higgs is not necessary ; removing it does not yield a noticeable change in results , because the parton densities restrict the cross section at energies where the higgs exchange becomes important . however , fermionic partners _ must _ be present for our coupling structure .",
    "they provide the gauge cancellations necessary for unitarity at energies well below a strong dynamics scale , as will be discussed below .",
    "note that not all little higgs models contain all these states ; instead , strong dynamics is expected to appear at the few - tev scale .    to limit our analysis to actual spin effects",
    ", we set all final - state same - sign charged particles masses to the chargino mass of sps9 ( 197  gev ) .",
    "moreover , we normalize all rates , as is common in similar lhc spin studies  @xcite .",
    "we recognize that in general new - physics scenarios , charged scalars and charged vectors are unlikely to be long - lived .",
    "however , as stressed above , our analysis in no way relies on this assumption . to make this obvious we show distinguishing kinematic distributions only for the tagging jets .",
    "it turns out that they alone can clearly discriminate between the various spins .",
    "[ fig : comp - jet ] shows four distributions for the two forward tagging jets : two angular correlations and two transverse momenta .",
    "all of them are independent of the long - lived nature of the charged particles .",
    "we first notice that the scalar case is markedly different from either the fermion or vector cases in all distributions .",
    "this arises from the virtual @xmath0 boson emitted from the incoming quarks .",

    "<S> we demonstrate the possibility of studying weakly interacting new particles in weak boson fusion , using the example of supersymmetric same - sign charginos . this signal could establish the existence of majorana neutralinos and give access to their electroweak couplings . </S>",
    "<S> it can be observed over ( supersymmetric ) qcd backgrounds provided the charginos are light and not too close to the squark mass . </S>",
    "<S> we finally show how same - sign fermion production can be distinguished from same - sign scalars or vectors arising in other models of new physics . </S>"
