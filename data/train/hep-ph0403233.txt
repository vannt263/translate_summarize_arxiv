    "more and more data of @xmath3 decays are being collected at the two @xmath3 factories , belle and babar .",
    "the original approach to non - leptonic @xmath3 decays based on the factorization approach ( fa ) @xcite , which succeeded in calculating the branching ratios of many decays @xcite .",
    "fa is a simple method , by which non - factorizable and annihilation contributions are neglected .",
    "although calculations are easy in fa , it suffers the problems of scale , infrared - cutoff and gauge dependence @xcite .",
    "especially it is difficult to explain some observed branching ratios of @xmath3 decays , such as @xmath4 @xcite . to improve the theoretical application @xcite and understand why the simple fa works",
    "so well @xcite , some methods have been brought forward and developed .",
    "one of them is the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach developed by brodsky and lepage @xcite , under which we can calculate the annihilation diagrams as well as the factorizable and non - factorizable diagrams .",
    "it is consistent to calculate branching ratios of @xmath3 decays in pqcd approach , as we will explain its framework in the next section .",
    "it has been applied in the non - leptonic @xmath3 decays @xcite successfully . in the case of @xmath5 decays , which is",
    "a kind of pure annihilation type decays , the physics picture of pqcd is as follows , shown in fig .",
    "1 . a @xmath6 boson exchange causes @xmath7 , and the @xmath8 quarks are produced from a gluon . in the rest frame of the @xmath3 meson , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks in the @xmath11 mesons",
    "each has momentum @xmath12@xmath13 , so the gluon producing them has @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "it is a hard gluon according to the mass of @xmath3 meson .",
    "so we can perturbatively treat these decays and use pqcd approach like other pure annihilation type @xmath3 decays @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we explain the framework of pqcd briefly . in section 3 ,",
    "we give the analytic formulae for the decays @xmath16 . in section 4 ,",
    "we show the numerical results and theoretical errors of the four modes respectively .",
    "finally , we draw a conclusion in section 5 .",
    "the pqcd approach divides the process into hard components , which are treated by perturbative theory , and non - perturbative components , which are put into the hadron wave function .",
    "the hadron wave function can be extracted from experimental data or calculated by qcd sum rules method .",
    "the decay amplitude can be conceptually written as the convolution @xmath17 , \\label{eq : convolution1}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 s are momenta of light quarks included in each meson , and @xmath19 denotes the trace over dirac and color indices .",
    "the hard components comprise hard part ( @xmath20 ) and harder dynamics ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "@xmath22 describes the four quark operator and the spectator quark connected by a hard gluon .",
    "it can be perturbatively calculated , since it includes the hard dynamics characterized by the scale @xmath23 , where @xmath24 @xmath25 for @xmath16 decays , and the hard gluon s @xmath26 is of the order @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the wilson coefficient which results from the radiative corrections at short distance . in the above convolution",
    ", @xmath28 includes the harder dynamics at a larger scale than the @xmath29 scale and describes the evolution of local four - fermi operators from @xmath30 down to the scale @xmath23 . the wave function @xmath31 denotes the non - perturbative components , which is independent of the specific processes and removes the infrared cut off dependence in pqcd approach .    according to the conservation of four - momentum ,",
    "we can obtain @xmath32 and @xmath33 meson s energy and momenta in the rest frame of @xmath3 meson , @xmath34 where the subscript ( 1,2,3 ) denote @xmath35 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 meson respectively , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "it is convenient to assume that the @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) meson moves in the plus ( minus ) @xmath40 direction carrying the momentum @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",

    "after deducing the analytic formulae of amplitudes , we ignore the terms proportional to @xmath47 or @xmath48,[eq : lpolarization ] ) .",

    "equivalently we ignore the terms proportional to @xmath50 in @xmath35 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 meson s momenta and longitudinal polarization vectors . therefore eqs.([eq :",
