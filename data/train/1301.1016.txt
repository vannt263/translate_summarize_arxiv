    ", we also evaluate the conditional quantum - noise suppression with applying an additional pumping pulse during the two probe pulses @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the pumping pulse resets the collective atomic spin state and thus the correlation due to the quantum fluctuation is expected to disappear as a result of the re - initialization .",
    "consequently , the correlation , if observed even with the application of the pumping pulse , should indicate the contribution from the classical noise . in our experiment",
    ", we minimize the possible residual correlation by adjusting an incident angle of the pumping pulse , which results in the conditional parameter of @xmath125 db for the independent coherent spin state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_sm](ii ) .",
    "this result confirms that the effect of thermal and technical noise is too small to mask the quantum fluctuations and our qndm has sufficient sensitivity to access the quantum fluctuations .",
    "possible origin of the technical noise is the residual magnetic field and the probe pointing fluctuation .",
    "the slight reduction of the conditional noise - suppression level compared with our previous work @xcite comes from the slight decrease of the atom number , and has nothing to do with the performance of the measurement - based quantum feedback control .",
    "we note that an increase of the conjugate quadrature noise due to the qndm was observed in our previous work using essentially the same experimental setup @xcite .",
    "after the probe pulse passes through the atomic ensemble , the qnd interaction under the influence of the scattering loss changes the canonical operators @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xcite : @xmath128 where the symbols with ( without ) a prime denote the operators after ( before ) the interaction , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the standard vacuum operators with variance @xmath12 , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the damping coefficients .",
    "the vacuum operators represent the contributions from unpolarized components due to the scattering .",
    "there are two essential assumptions to derive eq.([original1 ] ) : ( i ) one - dimensional model is appropriate , in other words , the interaction volume is of a pencil shape with fresnel number @xmath131 and ( ii ) the excited atoms decay into either of the two spin states in the ground state .",
    "the scattered photons are emitted into the same spatial mode with the probe pulse because of the former assumption , and thus are fed into the polarimeter .",
    "this effect is represented by the contribution of @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , all atoms which absorb a photon in the probe pulse come back to either of the two spin states in the ground state because of the latter assumption , therefore the atoms are not lost but partially depolarized due to the photon absorption - and - scattering process .",
    "the effect is represented by the contribution of @xmath130 .    in our experiment ,",
    "the fresnel number @xmath132 is much larger than unity and there are no other ground states ; i.e. , the latter ( ii ) is appropriate , but the former ( i ) is not .",
    "the qnd interaction in our experiment is therefore described by the following transformation : @xmath133      variance of the sum ( @xmath134 ) and the difference ( @xmath135 ) characterize the correlation between the two sequential outcomes .",
    "for the ideal case ( @xmath136 ) without feedback ( @xmath137 ) , the difference @xmath138 becomes @xmath139 and this is equal to the case without atoms ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "the variance @xmath76 without feedback ( @xmath137 ) can also be calculated by using the eq.([eq : trans ] ) as @xmath141 and @xmath142 holds over a wide range of the parameters around @xmath143 , e.g. , @xmath144 .",
    "however , as shown in table i ( i ) and ( iii ) , the experimentally observed @xmath145 is slightly larger than the variance of the light shot noise @xmath146 which is measured without atoms .",
    "the results suggest that the measurement outcomes include some additional uncorrelated noise , which can not be cancelled out by taking the difference between two sequential outcomes similarly to the light shot noise .",
    "the amount of the additional noise can be estimated as @xmath147 .",
    "we emphasize that the kind of noise can not be reduced by using the feedback in any way , and it just decreases the amount of the noise reduction .",
    "we can effectively take into account the presence of uncorrelated noise by adding the uncorrelated noise terms in eq.([original1 ] ) as follows : @xmath148 where a pair of @xmath149 and @xmath129 ( with variance @xmath12 ) represents the contribution form the additional uncorrelated noise .",
    "the term @xmath150 includes not only the scattering photons as the standard vacuum operator in eq.([original1 ] ) or ref.@xcite , but also the contributions from all uncorrelated noise in the presence of atoms .",
    "we can estimate @xmath151 from the modified model eq.([eq : revised ] ) with the experimental results @xmath145 and the variance of the light shot noise @xmath146 .",
    "adding the feedback term to eq.([eq : revised ] ) yields the following formula : @xmath152 where the third term of @xmath153 represents the effect of feedback .",
    "the pre - arranged target value @xmath154 has set to be about @xmath155 in the experiment .",
    "the absorption makes effective feedback gain to be @xmath156 times smaller than that in the case of no scattering loss .",
    "we have also done the multi - cycle feedback in the experiment , as shown in the timing sequence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_sm](c ) ) .",
    "we can express the multi - cycle feedback by using the following recurrence formula which corresponds to the generalized form of eq.([eq : feedback ] ) as @xmath157,\\nonumber\\\\ & \\text{where } f[a , b]=\\begin{cases}1&a\\le",
    "b\\\\0&a > b\\end{cases}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the variances are normalized as @xmath158 , and the working range of our feedback is limited as represented by the function @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "we define the conditional noise suppression parameter with the @xmath160-cycle feedback as @xmath161 .",
    "figure  [ fig : multifb ] shows the experimental result of @xmath162 , and it is again in good agreement with the theoretical prediction calculated by eq.([eq : multifb ] ) .",
    "note that the multi - cycle feedback is performed with the pre - fixed feedback gain , which is known as not the optimal one @xcite .",
    "multi - cycle feedback is expected to improve the noise suppression and broaden the gain dependence .    in this study , the achieved quantum - noise suppression and the successful feedback steps",
    "are limited because of the absorption of photons in probe pulses and the ballistic expansion of the atomic cloud .",
    "the realistic way to overcome the problems is to use an optical trap system .",
    "we can characterize the optical response of our collective spin system by using a complex valued susceptibility with taking into account of transition probabilities of associated transitions of @xmath1 . by using the model ,",
    "the coupling coefficient @xmath58 and the atomic damping coefficient @xmath61 can be represented as follows : @xmath163 the ratio between coupling strength and the atomic damping coefficient is therefore given by @xmath164 this result means that we should increase @xmath165 with some fixed value of @xmath166 in order to improve the feedback system .",
    "one of the most promising way to increase the effective @xmath92 is to increase the optical density by using the optical trap system .      in the theoretical model described above",
    ", we assume that the unpolarized component of atoms ( @xmath167 ) is not changed by the feedback control . here",
    "we consider the reliability of the assumption .",
    "first of all , it is likely that we can not get any information of the unpolarized spins from the first outcome @xmath168 , and thus the feedback control , which depends on @xmath168 , only applies some random spin - rotation and does not contribute the noise reduction of the unpolarized spins .",
    "in addition , even if we could get the information of the unpolarized spins from @xmath168 , the amount of the information is much smaller than the light shot noise because the upper bound of the signal to noise ( signal from the unpolarized spins to the light shot noise ) ratio can be estimated as @xmath169 .",
    "if we could obtain the information of the unpolarized spins with sufficient signal to noise ratio , the noise of the unpolarized spins can be reduced by the feedback .",
    "however , the gain dependence with the unpolarized spins is supposed to be drastically different from that with polarized spins . for the unpolarized spins",
    ", the positive and negative feedback equally reduce the spin fluctuation whereas the negativity of the feedback gain is essential for the polarized spins .",
    "this is because there are no special directions for the unpolarized spins except for the measurement axis , whereas the mean spin direction is well - defined for the polarized spins .",
    "in addition , the amount of the noise reduction for the unpolarized spins is negligibly small comparing with that for the polarized spins in the parameter range of the experiment .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood in the following way . in order to change the distribution of the @xmath28-component of angular momentum @xmath170",
    ", we displace @xmath170 by rotating the spins in our setup .",
    "the amount of the displacement with small rotation angle @xmath171 can be estimated as @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the total angular momentum .",
    "the polarized spin-@xmath12 system with @xmath174 atoms can be represented by the number of @xmath175 state - vectors with @xmath176 while the unpolarized mixed state requires @xmath177 state - vectors whose total angular momentum is mostly smaller than @xmath92 . for the noise reduction with the unpolarized spins , the rotation angle @xmath171 therefore has to be larger than that with the polarized spins to achieve the same amount of the displacement .",
    "the mean total angular momentum of the unpolarized mixed state can be estimated as @xmath178 . in our feedback control ,",
    "the rotation angle @xmath171 is given by the measurement outcome @xmath170 and the feedback gain @xmath105 as @xmath179 .",
    "for the polarized spins , the feedback with the optimal gain @xmath180 , which gives the maximum noise suppression , is determined by @xmath181 and @xmath182 , then the optimal feedback gain is roughly @xmath183 .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental parameter in our feedback control . on the other hand",
    "the optimal gain for the unpolarized spin state , say @xmath184 , is much larger because the larger rotation angle is required with the same outcome @xmath170 .",
    "similarly , the optimal value is determined by the inverse of the mean total angular momentum as @xmath185 . since @xmath186 in the experiment ,",
    "the value of @xmath187 estimated from this argument is more than @xmath188 times larger than the value of @xmath189 .",
    "the asymmetric behaviour of polarized spins is clearly observed in fig .  3 and 4 .",
    "it confirms that the observed spin noise reduction arises from the feedback control of the polarized component , and that the most of the unpolarized component is not changed within the parameter range of the feedback gain , which is around the optimal one for polarized spins @xmath190 .    in the following part of this section , we analyze the effect of the feedback control on the unpolarized spins more quantitatively .",
    "in order to see the effect of noise suppression on the unpolarized spins , let us define the complete basis labelled by @xmath173 , @xmath170 , and an additional quantum number @xmath191 . using the basis @xmath192",
    ", we can express the unpolarized @xmath174-spin state as @xmath193 where @xmath194 with the even @xmath174 , and @xmath195 with the odd @xmath174 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath173 is either an integer or half - integer and is less than or equal to @xmath196 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath197 distinguishes between the @xmath198-degenerated subspaces @xcite : @xmath199 the mixed state @xmath200 is already given by the ensemble of the quantum states which are characterized by @xmath170 .",
    "since @xmath170 corresponds to the first measurement outcomes @xmath29 or @xmath168 , we use the character @xmath201 instead of @xmath170 for the sake of convenience .",
    "note that we ignore the readout noise here , but the approximation just emphasizes the gain - dependence for the unpolarized spins .",
    "we can express the state after the feedback as @xmath202 where @xmath105 is the feedback gain , and @xmath203 represents the rotation about the @xmath43-axis with the rotation angle @xmath171 .",
    "our interest is in the probability of getting the outcome @xmath204 , which corresponds to @xmath30 or @xmath205 , by measuring the observable @xmath26 of the state @xmath206 .",
    "corresponding measurement operator is given by @xmath207 .",
    "the joint probability distribution of @xmath204 ( after the feedback ) and @xmath201 ( before the feedback ) can be calculated with wigner d function @xcite @xmath208 as @xmath209=\\text{tr}[m_{m_1}\\rho']\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2^n}\\sum_{j = j_0}^{n/2 } p_{nj}|d_{m0,m_1}^{(j)}(g m_0)|^2.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] probability distributions @xmath210 and @xmath211 can also be calculated as @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "we can estimate various variances @xmath49 by using the probability distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : corr](a ) shows the numerically estimated variances of the sum ( @xmath214 ) and the difference ( @xmath215 ) as a function of the feedback gain @xmath105 for the completely mixed state @xmath216 with @xmath217 .",
    "one can clearly see the variances change symmetrically about the feedback gain .",
    "figure [ fig : corr](b ) also shows the noise reduction due to the feedback for @xmath218 .",
    "here we define the noise reduction parameter of the unpolarized spins as @xmath219 , which corresponds to the unconditional squeezing parameter of the polarized spins .",
    "it is suggested that the optimal gain @xmath220 is @xmath221 in single feedback for @xmath218 , and the result is consistent with the above estimation of @xmath222 ."
