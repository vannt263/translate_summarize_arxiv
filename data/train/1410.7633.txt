    "it is known that in maxwell s electrodynamics a point - like charge has an infinite electromagnetic energy .",
    "this problem of singularity was solved in the born - infeld ( bi ) electrodynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where a new parameter with the dimension of the length was introduced .",
    "the dimensional constant introduced in bi electrodynamics gives the upper bound on the possible electric field .",
    "therefore , non - linear electrodynamics can give a finite electromagnetic energy of an electron .",
    "it should be noted that in qed one - loop quantum corrections give contributions to classical electrodynamics that result in the appearance of non - linear terms in the lagrangian @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "some examples of non - linear electrodynamics were considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
