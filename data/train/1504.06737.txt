    "circular dichroism has been one of the powerful methodologies to extract information on spin and/or orbital properties of charge carriers in solid state systems  @xcite . in addition , recent study on graphene has suggested that information on berry phase can also be obtained via the circular dichroism  @xcite , extending a previous approach of the direct measurement of berry phase using linearly polarized lights for the same system  @xcite .",
    "these results provide an experimental evidence that the quantum mechanical phases can be probed by photoemission spectroscopy , previously not believed to be possible , and hence constitute the first band specific measurements of berry phase .",
    "these interesting observations have been possible due to the simple geometric structure of graphene , allowing us to obtain the explicit form of the initial electronic states within the tight - binding formalism  @xcite .",
    "et al_. ,  @xcite calculated photoelectron intensity , which is the absolute square of the transition matrix element @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a tight - binding eigenstate , @xmath3 is a plane - wave final state , and @xmath4 . here , *",
    "a * is a light polarization and @xmath5 is the momentum operator , where @xmath6 is the planck s constant .",
    "this approach reproduces the photoelectron intensity for the linearly polarized light along the @xmath7-axis denoted in fig .",
    "1(a ) , i.e. , x - polarization ( @xmath8 ) , whereas it is not successful in reproducing full polarization dependence of the photoelectron intensity , e.g. , when the light polarization is rotated by 90 degrees , i.e. , y - polarization ( @xmath9 )  @xcite .",
    "this issue originates from the application of @xmath10 to the tight - binding eigenstates .",
    "when the tight - binding hamiltonian is intrinsically non - local , the derivative in real space for the tight - binding eigenstate does not work  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the agreement even for x - polarization using * p *  @xcite could be fortuitous . in order to solve this issue , hwang _",

    ", they have claimed that the observed circular dichroism originates from berry phase of graphene , which is challenged by a study on the circular dichroism as a function of electron binding energy  @xcite .",
    "in fact , another experimental study shows that the circular dichroism varies upon changing photon energy , emphasizing the role of the final state effect in understanding photoemission signal from graphene  @xcite .",
    "these controversies give rise to a fundamental question on the origin of the circular dichroism .    , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the three vectors connecting the in - plane nearest neighbor atoms where @xmath17   .",
    "the positions of the k and k@xmath18 points are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , where @xmath21 . ]    here we report calculated photoelectron intensity of graphene for circularly polarized light",
    ". the photoemission matrix element was constructed using the velocity operator  @xcite within the tight - binding formalism .",
    "we found that the photoelectron intensity for left- and right - circularly polarized light ( lcp and rcp , respectively ) does not show any difference for perfect circular polarization . on the other hand , upon decreasing the purity of the polarization , the photoelectron intensity starts to exhibit circular dichroism .",
    "our results indicate that an experimental condition in conjunction with the intrinsic effects such as the isospin of charge carriers and the final states  @xcite plays an important role in determining photoelectron intensity .",
    "figure  1(a ) shows the geometric structure of graphene with two carbon sublattices , a and b. in order to describe the electron energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions , we have used tight - binding formalism for the @xmath22 orbital of each sublattice using the in - plane nearest - neighbor ( a - b ) hopping integral , @xmath23 ( we confine our interest to this single parameter for simplicity ) , which corresponds to @xmath24 in the well - known slonczewski - weiss - mcclure model  @xcite . because our basis set for the tight - binding model has more than one non - equivalent orbitals , there exist two different hopping parameters differing only in the sign that give exactly the same electron band structure . in this sense , the absolute magnitude of inter - orbital hopping integrals within the empirical tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath25 between non - equivalent states ( i.e. , @xmath26 , where the localized orbitals @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not equivalent ) in any material have only been speculated theoretically , whereas it has recently been proved that the sign of the hopping integrals for both single- and double - layer graphene can be experimentally determined uniquely using the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) technique  @xcite .",
    "we have used @xmath29  ev and @xmath30 , the values in table ii of grneis _ et al . , _",
    "@xcite and in fig",
    ".  8 of hwang _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian of graphene for two - dimensional wavevector * k * is as follows  @xcite : @xmath31 using a basis set composed of bloch sums of localized orbitals on each sublattice : @xmath32 with @xmath33 s defined as in fig .",
    "1(a ) , and @xmath34 @xmath35    in the presence of the vector potential * a * , the hamiltonian is obtained by peierls substitution , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "then , the interaction hamiltonian @xmath37 is obtained by the first - order term of * a * from @xmath38 , and represented as @xmath39 using the velocity operator @xmath40/i\\hbar$ ] , where @xmath41 in the * k*-representation , @xmath6 is the planck s constant , _ e _ is the charge of an electron , _ c _ is the speed of light .",
    "then the interaction hamiltonian becomes  @xcite : @xmath42 note here that because @xmath43 depends only on the @xmath44 and @xmath45 components of the wavevector * k * , there is no contribution arising from the _ z _ component of the vector potential @xmath46 within this tight - binding model . in real measurements , the light with a nonzero polarization component along the _",
    "z _ direction will give rise to an additive isotropic term to the photoelectron intensity that is independent of the in - plane polarization of the light .",
    "the photoelectron intensity is described by the absolute square of the transition matrix element @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is graphene eigenstate with the band index @xmath49 for conduction ( @xmath50 ) and valence ( @xmath51 ) bands , and @xmath52 is the plane - wave final state projected onto the @xmath22 orbitals of graphene . for graphene , we may use @xmath53 here , we neglect the @xmath54 dependence of the final state , as done in the previous works  @xcite . for a few tens",
    "ev photons , typical for arpes measurements for graphene  @xcite , @xmath54 of the plane - wave final state is much larger than @xmath44 and @xmath45 , leading to only a small variation in @xmath54 with any change in @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , the study on @xmath54 , i.e. , photon energy dependence , is beyond the capability of the tight - binding formalism , but can be achieved through the first principles calculations  @xcite .",
    "when we consider the case where * k * is very close to the dirac point * k * as denoted in fig .",
    "1(b ) , and define @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_def ] ) becomes @xmath57 and the hamiltonians become @xmath58 and @xmath59 where * @xmath60 * is the pauli matrix .",
    "then the electron energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions of the @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , when @xmath64 is the angle between * q * and the @xmath65 direction . with this setup ,",
    "the photoemission matrix elements for x- and y - polarizations are given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , of which absolute square , i.e. , @xmath68 , represents photoelectron intensity that reproduces the previous experimental results for linearly polarized lights  @xcite .",
    "resultantly , the variation of photoelectron intensity depending on the polarity of light reveals the pseudospin nature of charge carriers in single- and double - layer graphene , i.e. , berry phase of @xmath0 and @xmath69 , respectively , and the signs of hopping integral in the tight - binding hamiltonian for double - layer graphene or graphite  @xcite .    in the same analogy , for the circularly polarized light ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath70 , the photoemission matrix element is given by @xmath71 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 correspond to lcp and rcp , respectively .",
    "for the states above the dirac energy , i.e. , @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 and for the states below the dirac energy , i.e. , @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 it follows that @xmath78 and @xmath79 regardless of the chirality of the light .",
    "this simple algebra indicates that , within the tight - binding formalism for @xmath80 , @xmath81 is isotropic around the constant energy contour .",
    "however , in real measurements , the photoelectron intensity for x- and y - polarization geometries are different due to nonzero polarization component along the @xmath82 direction , e.g. , @xmath83 exhibits a finite @xmath84 component when projected to the sample surface , whereas @xmath85 has negligible out - of - plane component  @xcite , when the photoelectron intensity is closely related to the scattering probability of the real @xmath22 orbitals for the out - of - plane component of light polarization , which is beyond the capability of the tight - binding approach .",
    "for example , at a photon energy of 50  ev , the ratio of @xmath86 is @xmath8721.4  @xcite that we have used throughout our study .",
    "this ratio is not controllable , but determined for each experimental setup for each photon energy .",
    "this is also applied to the circular polarization , for which @xmath70 is projected onto the sample surface .",
    "these theoretical results are summarized in fig .  2 at several different energies with respect to the dirac energy , @xmath88 .",
    "for lcp ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , the constant energy contour shows a crescent - like shape with minimum intensity in the first brillouin zone ( 1st b.z . ) at @xmath89  ev and a point - like constant energy map at @xmath88 .",
    "the intensity distribution is reversed at @xmath90  ev , with respect to @xmath88 , with maximum intensity in the 1st b.z .",
    "while the overall shape shows the characteristic conical dispersion of graphene , the intensity distribution is similar to the case of x - polarization  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that , for linear polarizations , the crescent - like shape is understood by the interference between photoelectrons emitted from two carbon sublattices  @xcite . on the other hand , for circular polarizations",
    ", it originates from the relatively weak photoelectron intensity for y - polarization as discussed above . as a result",
    ", the difference in photoelectron intensity between lcp and rcp is not determined by the properties of initial states , but given by the experimental geometry , and hence we expect the same intensity distribution for rcp as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) .    note also that our results ( eqs .",
    "( 14 - 15 ) and  ( 18 ) ) for the conduction band are different from those in the previous study ( eq .  ( 3 ) of the ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath91 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 signs correspond to lcp and rcp , respectively . in this study",
    "@xcite , they have claimed that the dipole transition matrix elements @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the _ x _ and _ y _ components of the vector potential have a relation of @xmath94 at 30  ev  @xcite .",
    "this setup results in following photoelectron intensity ( eq .",
    "( 4 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the perfect circular polarization , i.e. , @xmath95 , @xmath96 the difference between the two theoretical approaches ( eq .  ( [ eq : i_cp_1 ] ) vs. eq .",
    "( [ eq : liu_2 ] ) ) originates from the evolution of the tight - binding hamiltonian . for example , for @xmath97 , the hamiltonian is expressed via pauli matrices , i.e. , @xmath98 ( eq .  ( 8) ) , where @xmath99 is the fermi velocity , with which we can obtain the tight - binding eigenstates ( used in both works done by us ( eq .",
    "( 10 ) ) and liu _ et al . _",
    "hence , the peierls substitution naturally leads to @xmath100  @xcite , both of which components exhibit a strong influence on the photoemission matrix element when applied to the spinor eigenstate of graphene  @xcite as we have done in our study . on the other hand , liu",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , have applied the local hamiltonian , @xmath101 , to the tight - binding eigenstates ( eq .  ( 10 ) ) obtained by the nonlocal tight - binding hamiltonian ( eq .  ( 1 ) )",
    "consequently , the _ y _ component of the matrix element differs by the imaginary number `` @xmath102 '' arising from @xmath103 ( compare eqs .",
    "( 14 - 15 ) and  ( [ eq : liu_2 ] ) ) resulting in the completely different photoelectron intensity distributions [ this issue is eliminated when the realistic eigenstates , e.g. , maximally localized wannier functions obtained by _ ab initio _ calculations  @xcite , are used in conjunction with the local hamiltonian ] .    in real measurements , in contrast to our prediction , the photoelectron intensity from graphene exhibits circular dichroism  @xcite .",
    "the intensity maximum around a constant energy contour rotates by 180  degrees upon changing the chirality of light with an energy of 30  ev  @xcite .",
    "such a dichroic effect varies at different photon energies  @xcite , which has been attributed to the symmetry of the final states ( @xmath104-like partial waves above a photon energy of 52  ev and @xmath105 or @xmath106-like partial waves below 52  ev  @xcite ) .",
    "the photon energy dependence suggests that , when the final state effect is minimized around 52  ev , the still observed circular dichroism originates from the psuedospin nature of charge carriers in graphene  @xcite .",
    "another study shows that , at a similar photon energy of 50  ev , the circular dichroism changes as a function of electron binding energy , which suggests a possibility of many - body interactions as an origin of the observed dichroism  @xcite .",
    "these ambiguities in understanding experimental results may suggest the existence of an extrinsic factor contributing to the circular dichroism that changes at different experimental geometries and photon energies , such as imperfect circular polarization .",
    "in fact , the polarization purity for lcp and rcp in the experimental work for the berry phase scenario is @xmath8780  %  @xcite .",
    "ev for 100  % , 80  % , and 50  % circular polarization .",
    "an arbitrary energy broadening of 0.10  ev has been used .",
    "the photon energy is assumed to be 50  ev and the angle of incident photons and surface normal is 26 degrees , adapting the experimental geometry in ref .  @xcite . ]    in fig .  3",
    ", we show the effect of the imperfect polarization on the rotation of intensity maximum upon changing the chirality of light .",
    "we assume that the angle between the photon incident and the electron detector angles is 55 degrees ( e.g. , the experimental setup for the previous experiment  @xcite ) .",
    "then the angle between the photon incident and the sample normal angles is determined by photon energies .",
    "for example , at 50  ev , where the * k * points is tilted by @xmath8729 degrees with respect to the sample normal , the angle between the photon incident and the sample normal angles is @xmath8726 degrees ( 14 and 31  degrees for 30 and 70  ev photons , respectively ) .",
    "in addition , for imperfect circular polarization , the major axis of the elliptical polarization is tilted by @xmath10745 degrees for lcp and rcp , respectively , with respect to @xmath108 direction . as a result",
    ", the elliptical polarization @xmath109 projected to the sample surface becomes @xmath110 and @xmath111 along _ x_- and _ y_-axis , respectively , where @xmath112 defines the purity of the polarization .",
    "when the purity of the polarization is 100  % ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , the intensity maximum around the constant energy contour at @xmath89  ev stays the same upon changing the chirality of light as denoted by the white arrows . when the purity of the polarization decreases , the intensity maximum becomes separated as denoted by the white arrows in fig .",
    "3(b ) giving rise to the circular dichroism .",
    "the circular dichroism becomes stronger with further decreasing purity of the polarization as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) .    to further discuss the discrepancy of our results compared to experimental results",
    ", we directly compare the rotational angles in both our and previous studies .",
    "when the final state effect is minimal at 52  ev  @xcite , i.e. , intrinsic properties of graphene dominate photoelectron intensities , the rotation of intensity maxima is only @xmath8740 degrees  @xcite , different from the rotation by 180  degrees corresponding to the berry phase scenario  @xcite .",
    "while the tight - binding approach that we have used excellently reproduces the experimental data for linearly polarized light with an energy of 50  ev  @xcite , the observed ( @xmath8740  degrees ) and predicted ( @xmath8760  degrees via the first principles calculations ) dichroism  @xcite is comparable to our result of 40 - 60  degrees for the polarization purity of 80 - 50  % ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "now let us restrict our discussion to the case where the photon energy only changes photon polarization with respect to the sample surface . with this set up , the simulations for left - circularly polarized light with a polarization vector corresponding several photon energies ( 30 , 50 , and 70  ev in figs .",
    "4(a - c ) , respectively ) . here , the angle between incident photons and the analyzer is assumed to be 55  degrees .",
    "this simulation does not show a notable rotation of photoelectron intensity around a constant energy contour upon changing photon energy , suggesting that the final state effect  @xcite plays a dominant role in reproducing the photon energy dependence , while the experimental condition in conjunction with intrinsic effects , such as the pseudopin nature of charge carriers  @xcite and the many - body effects  @xcite , also plays a finite role in rotating photoelectron intensity upon changing the chirality of light at constant photon energy .",
    "overall , the theoretical approach within tight - binding formalism predicts an additional factor for the circular dichroism and hence suggests the importance of experimental conditions to understand circular dichroism observed via photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "an arbitrary energy broadening of 0.10  ev has been used .",
    "the photon energy is assumed to be ( a ) 30 , ( b ) 50 , and ( c ) 70  ev , where the angle of incident photons and surface normal is 14 , 26 , and 31  degrees , adapting the experimental geometry in ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "we have investigated the role of imperfect circular polarization in the circular dichroism of photoelectron intensity observed in graphene . within the tight - binding formalism",
    ", we found that the calculated photoemission matrix element does not predict any difference between left- and right - circular polarization .",
    "however , we found that circular dichroism is developed and enhanced with decreasing purity of the polarization .",
    "our results implies that the experimental conditions should be taken into account to understand circular dichroism , which invites further experimental and theoretical investigation to understand the origin of the observed circular dichroism in graphene",
