    "starting from 1997 , measurements of the casimir force @xcite between a closely spaced gold coated spherical lens or sphere and a plate has attracted widespread attention in areas ranging from nanotechnology to constraining predictions of fundamental physical theories beyond the standard model ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed analysis of all performed experiments ) .",
    "an important constituent of any casimir force measurement is the electrostatic calibration .",
    "this allows an independent determination of some vitally important parameters ( the absolute separation between two closely spaced bodies , the residual potential difference between their surfaces , spring constant etc . ) by fitting the electric force arising between a lens or a sphere and a plate under an applied voltage to the known force law .",
    "the experimental procedures for electrostatic calibrations were discussed in detail in the pioneering papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a basic assumption used was that the electric force is given by the exact formula of electrostatics obtained for an ideal metal sphere above an ideal metal plane @xcite .",
    "a very precise asymptotic expansion of this formula in powers of @xmath0 was also obtained @xcite , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the sphere - plate separation , and @xmath3 is the sphere radius . the first term of the expansion which is of order @xmath4 coincides with the electric force , as calculated by using the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the typical sphere radii used in these experiments were about @xmath5 m and separation distances between the sphere and the plate were of order 100 nm @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite reconsidered electrostatic calibration in the sphere - plane geometry by replacing the small sphere with a spherical lens of centimeter - size radius @xmath3 at a very close separation from the plate , @xmath6 nm .",
    "both test bodies were covered with gold layers .",
    "the experimental data obtained from the electrostatic calibration demonstrated an anomalous dependence of the gradient of the electric force on separation @xmath7 instead of @xmath8 , as follows from the main contribution to the exact formula mentioned above .",
    "this result was discussed in refs .",
    "specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that their data for the electrostatic force between a sphere and a plate in the separation range @xmath9 nm followed the standard electrostatic law .",

    "section iv is devoted to the capacitance measurements in the experiment on the dynamic determination of the casimir pressure by means of a micromechanical torsional oscillator .",
    "we present the experimental data for the capacitance in the configuration of a small au - coated sapphire sphere above an au - coated polisilicon plate , and demonstrate excellent agreement with theoretical results of electrostatics for a sphere - plane configuration with a perfectly shaped sphere .",
    "section v contains our conclusions and discussion .",
    "we consider an ideal metal sphere of radius @xmath3 at a close separation @xmath2 above an ideal metal plane .",

    "both these values are not reproducible .",
    "the large values of the reduced @xmath82 obtained by us mean that the fit is in fact not satisfactory .",
    "it is well known @xcite that if the resulting value of @xmath82 is much larger than @xmath86 , one should carefully check all assumptions on which the choice of the fitting function is based .",
    "for all fits mentioned above , the probability to obtain not a smaller value of @xmath82 is negligibly small .",
    "this means that the data in fact are not related to the model being used in the fit .",
    "thus , the failure of the model with an ideal geometrical shape is not surprising because spherical surfaces of centimeter - size radii inevitably deviate from perfect sphericity @xcite .",
    "our model ( [ eq11 ] ) takes into account deviations from sphericity only in the close vicinity of the lens bottom point .",
    "this is sufficient to correctly describe the anomalous behavior @xcite of the electric force at short separations between a lens and a plate below 100 nm , but not sufficient to fit the measurement data for the capacitance over much wider separation regions .",
    "the latter are influenced by the deviations of the lens surface from sphericity over a much larger area .",
    "in fact the capacitance is very sensitive to the variation of geometry , and hence attempts to fit the experimental data without a careful study of the surface topography are not productive . in the next section",
    "we will analyze the results of the capacitance measurements for the most precise experiment on the casimir force @xcite using a small sphere of the best achievable quality .",
    "the experiment @xcite on the dynamic determination of the casimir pressure using a small sphere oscillating in the vertical direction near a plate suspended at two opposite points by serpentine springs , is the most precise experiment in casimir physics .",

    "@xcite ) . here , we report the results of the capacitance measurements in the same experiment and their comparison with theory .",
    "capacitance measurements were performed using the same setup as was used to measure the casimir force .",
    "data reported in this paper were acquired at the same time the data for the electrostatic force and the casimir force published in @xcite were measured .",
    "the main part of the setup was an au - coated sapphire sphere above an au - coated polysilicon microelectromechanical torsional oscillator ( mto ) .",
    "the sphere had a radius @xmath87 m and the plate had dimensions of @xmath88 .",
    "the sphere was glued to an au - covered optical fiber .",
    "the purpose of the fiber is to directly measure the changes in separation between the end of the fiber and the platform that holds the mto ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for the schematic of the setup ) .",
    "capacitance measurements were performed using a capacitance bridge .",
    "the mto , as well as the surrounding metallic structures in the system , were kept at the same potential , while the potential of the sphere - fiber assembly was varied sinusoidally at a frequency @xmath89khz , much larger than the resonant frequency of the mto . under these conditions , the oscillator is stationary , and the capacitance can be obtained directly .",
    "the total capacitance of the system @xmath90 is found as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the parasitic capacitance , determined mainly by the capacitance between wires , and the capacitance between the fiber and the platform ( the capacitance between the sphere - fiber assembly and the rest of the system is negligible ) . while the capacitance between wires is independent of separation",
    ", the capacitance between the end of the fiber and the platform is a function of their separation .",

    "these results were fitted to the total capacitance of the system given by the sum of the exact expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) in a sphere - plate configuration , and the parasitic capacitance .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the separation between the end of the cleaved fiber and the platform . here",

    "the capacitance of the plane capacitor can then be represented as @xmath107 . introducing the notations @xmath108 and @xmath109 ,",
    "we can write the parasitic capacitance in the form @xmath110 the fit of the results of capacitance measurements to the total theoretical capacitance @xmath111 , which is equal to the sum of expressions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) , was performed by the minimization of the function ( [ eq17 ] ) with two unknown parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the resulting values of these parameters providing a minimum value to the quantity ( [ eq17 ] ) are @xmath114pf and @xmath115 .",

    "we emphasize that the fit was performed with respect to only two parameters of the parasitic capacitance which is determined by uncontrolled random factors .",
    "thus , the obtaining of not a smaller value of @xmath82 in each next repetition of the measurement is really highly probable .",
    "the excellent agreement of our capacitance data with the model of a perfect spherical surface is seen in fig .  5 where most of deviations of the data dots from the theoretical curve are in the limits of experimental errors . the seemingly larger scatter of the experimental dots around the solid line in fig .  5 , in comparison with figs .  2 and 3(b ) ,",
    "is explained by the different ranges of the variation of capacitance . in figs .  2 and 3(b )",
    "capacitance varies by about 10pf over the separation region of a few micrometers , but in fig .  5",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) for the capacitance in the configuration of a sphere above a plane . to discuss the usefulness of capacitance measurements , it is interesting to compare our results with those obtained when some approximate expression is used in the fit .",

    "( [ eq19 ] ) is equal to 0.7 , i.e. , is the same as in the case of the exact eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this means that it may be not possible to uniquely choose a preferable model when fitting several theoretical expressions to the experimental data of capacitance measurements with fitting parameters owing to the parasitic capacitances .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the more exact and the less exact approximate analytical expressions for the capacitance and the electric force are equally applicable in electrostatic calibrations . for comparison purposes , in table i we present the computational results for the capacitances ( column 24 ) and the electric forces normalized by the factor @xmath122 ( columns 57 ) at different separations ( column 1 ) .",
    "the values of the capacitances and electric forces are calculated using the exact expression in eqs .",

    "such large errors are explained by the fact that the pfa does not take into account the constant term in the capacitance [ see eq .",

    "when such a constant @xmath112 is added to model the parasitic capacitances [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) ] , and is determined from the fit , it compensates for the missing separation - independent contribution in the theoretical expression provided by the pfa . as to the perturbative expansion for the capacitance in column 4 , it is in much better agreement with the exact results in column 2 .",

    "@xcite which reported the anomalous scaling law for the electric force in the configuration of a large lens above a plane plate , and the subsequent discussion @xcite . keeping in mind the importance of electrostatic calibrations for the determination of the precision of the experimental results used in numerous applications of the casimir force ,",
    "a conclusive explanation of the puzzle is highly desirable .",
    "an attempt at such an explanation was undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite by suggesting the model of a modified lens surface which reproduces the anomalous scaling law for the force observed in @xcite .",
    "this explanation was disputed in refs .",
    "@xcite by claiming that the suggested model is in much worse agreement with the results of capacitance measurements than the model of perfect spherical lens surface . here , we demonstrate that the objections of refs .",
    "@xcite against the model proposed in @xcite are incorrect . as shown in sec .",
    "iii , instead of comparing the exact expression for the capacitance found in ref .",
    "@xcite with the corresponding experimental data , ref .",
    "@xcite made the comparison of the data with another function which does not reproduce the behavior of the exact expression of ref .",
    "we have shown that the exact capacitance of ref .",
    "@xcite is in better agreement with the data than the one for an ideal spherical surface as used in refs .",
    "@xcite . at the same time",
    ", we have also shown that the agreement with the data of both models of a lens surface modified near the closest point to the plate and of an ideal spherical surface is not satisfactory .",
    "this can be explained by the role of more irregularities distributed over a larger area of the surface of a centimeter size sphere which inevitably contribute to the capacitance .    to add important new information to this discussion , in sec .",
    "iv we have presented new experimental data on the capacitance measurements in the casimir setup using a micromechanical torsional oscillator @xcite .",
    "this setup includes a perfectly shaped sapphire sphere of a radius 200 times smaller than the lens radius in refs .",
    "the experimental data were carefully compared with the exact expression for the capacitance in a sphere - plane configuration .",
    "different approximate representations for it , as discussed in sec .",
    "ii , were also analyzed .",
    "it was shown that the experimental data for the capacitance measurement in the setup using a micromechanical torsional oscillator are in excellent agreement with the model of a perfect spherical surface .",
    "this provides additional confirmation for the high quality of the au - coated sapphire sphere used in that experiment .",
    "one additional conclusion obtained in sec .",
    "iv is that by using the capacitance measurements and by fitting them to different theoretical expressions it may be difficult to conclude which expression is in better agreement with data .",
    "the reason is that the capacitance measurements unavoidably contain a contribution from the parasitic capacitances which can not be calculated theoretically with sufficient accuracy and whose parameters are determined from the fit .",
    "this permits us to conclude that the capacitance measurements in the electrostatic calibrations of the casimir setups should be considered as an auxiliary tool providing an opportunity to confirm the good quality of the spherical surface used , and the correctness in the determination of absolute separations . in",
    "so doing the fitting of the data of the electric force measurements to the exact theoretical expression remains the main tool of electrostatic calibration in experiments on measuring the casimir force .",
