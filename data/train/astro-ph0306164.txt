    "the detection of non gaussianity in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps will question the validity of standard inflationary theories .",
    "these theories assume the existence of a single scalar field as well as linear theory , to generate the cosmological perturbations that will later develop into the structures observed in the universe .",
    "some alternative scenarios will include the presence of topological defects ( durrer 1999 ) or isocurvature fluctuations ( peebles 1999a , b ) , multi - field inflation models ( bernardeau & uzan 2002 and references therein ) and stochastic inflationary scenarios generating features in the inflaton potential ( starobinsky 1986 ) .",
    "moreover , in a recent work by acquaviva et al .",
    "( 2002 ) it is shown how the inclusion of secondary effects will modify the predictions of one single scalar field theories .",
    "all the above alternatives to standard inflation will result in non gaussian cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "the type and amount of non gaussianity to be observed in cmb maps is under study at the moment .",
    "there have been several works exploring the implications on cmb observations of different physical mechanisms that will generate non gaussianity ( komatsu & spergel 2001 , landriau & shellard 2002 , acquaviva et al . 2002 , gupta et al .",
    "2002 , gangui et al .",
    "tests of a scenario including a quadratic term in the gravitational potential have been performed on cobe - dmr cmb data ( komatsu et al . 2002 , cayn et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the poor resolution of these data does not provide a very good constraint of the non - linear coupling parameter accounting for the contribution of the quadratic term .",
    "however , it can be concluded that the method based on the spherical mexican hat wavelet provides a better constraint than the one based on the bispectrum .    at present",
    "there is a large effort to implement different statistical tools that will allow us in the future to test the gaussianity of observed cmb data .",
    "the power of the different methods will vary depending on the type of non gaussianity present in the data . in this paper",
    "we propose three goodness - of - fit tests and study their power on simulations .",
    "we simulate gaussian and non gaussian maps . the later",
    "are performed using the edgeworth expansion .",
    "this expansion was for the first time used to simulate non gaussian cmb maps by martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "the proposed methods are specially well suited to analyse data covering a region of the sky and not necessarily taken on a regular grid .",
    "we have applied them to the recently released maxima data ( balbi et al .",
    "2000 , hanany et al .",
    "the maxima data have already been tested against gaussianity by wu et al .",
    "2001 and santos et al .",
    "2002a , b .",
    "both works conclude that the data are compatible with gaussianity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 1 is dedicated to present the goodness - of - fit tests as well as to test them on non gaussian simulations generated using the edgeworth expansion .",
    "an application to the maxima data is presented in section 2 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are included in section 3 .",
    "given a sample of uncorrelated and normalized ( zero mean , dispersion one ) cmb data , the question we want to answer is `` how well the data agree with the population of a gaussian distribution @xmath1 '' ( the methods here used are also suited for testing a composite hypothesis where mean and dispersion are not specified ) .",
    "many goodness - of - fit methods have been developed to test normality ( for a review see dagostino @xmath0 stephens 1986 ) .",
    "out of all we have chosen to apply the shapiro - francia one ( shapiro & francia 1972 ) , a modification of the shapiro - wilk test for large data sets .",
    "implementation of the shapiro - francia requires the following steps:1 ) - estimation of the 1 dimensional array @xmath2 corresponding to the expected sorted values obtained from independent gaussian simulations @xmath1 .",
    "we define @xmath3 2 ) - for a given sorted data set @xmath4 , the shapiro - francia statistic @xmath5 is defined as follows @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of data and @xmath8 is the dispersion .",
    "the expected value of this statistic for the gaussian distribution is very close to one .",
    "deviations from gaussianity will result in values smaller than one .",
    "the distribution of the sf statistic for independent gaussian realizations is presented in figure 1 .",
    "smooth goodness - of - fit methods have been constructed as powerful tests against distributions that might deviate `` smoothly '' from the normal @xmath1 one .",
    "these methods are sensitive to the presence of skewness ( @xmath9 ) , kurtosis ( @xmath10 ) and higher order moments .",
    "some of them are defined based on orthonormal functions ( rayner @xmath0 best 1990 ) whereas others make use of powers of the distribution function ( thomas @xmath0 pierce 1979 ) .",
    "the uncategorised smooth models proposed by rayner @xmath0 best ( 1990 ) @xmath11 make use of the hermite - chebyshev polynomials @xmath12 and are defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 . the statistic @xmath11 is related to cumulants of order @xmath15 , such that for example : @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the average . and if @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath11 statistic is distributed as a @xmath24 for the gaussian case .",
    "we also make use in this paper of the smooth goodness - of - fit test @xmath25 proposed by thomas @xmath0 pierce ( 1979 ) as a modification of neyman s one .",
    "this test is built on powers of the normal distribution function and compares sample means of these quantities with the expected values under the null hypothesis that the data correspond to a population sample of the normal distribution .",

    "statistics for 50000 independent gaussian realizations are presented in figures 2 and 3 . in both cases , and in the examples and applications presented below , the data are renormalized to zero mean and unit variance before the tests are applied . because of that the @xmath11 statistics appear as @xmath36 distributions .",
    "the distributions of the two statistics converge to the expected ones .",
    "however one can see that the @xmath25 statistic converges faster to the expected distribution than the @xmath11 .    as an example of",
    "how well these methods work on separating gaussian from nongaussian data , we have applied them to simulated non gaussian data following distributions as in martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "an array with 2164 independent pixels constitutes a simulation .",
    "the chosen number of pixels fits the number of central pixels in the maxima map , later selected for analysis .",
    "the pixel value is drawn from a non gaussian distribution obtained through the edgeworth expansion characterised by a given skewness and kurtosis .",
    "given an input skewness and kurtosis , the mean and dispersion value for these two statistics in the resulting simulations are given in table 1 , as well as the skewness and kurtosis power to discriminate between gaussian and non gaussian distributions .",
    "10000 simulations were performed and the power of the smooth goodness of fit statistics presented in this paper is given for several input skewness and kurtosis values in table 2 and table 3 .",
    "as one can see from these results , most of the presented goodness - of - fit statistics have more power than the directly calculated cumulants .",
    "the @xmath37 statistic is the one with higher discriminating power in most of the cases .",
    "even so , the result is very dependent on the underlying distribution .",

    "the performance of these methods was checked on simulations based on the edgeworth expansion including distortions produced by the presence of cumulants of order higher than two .",
    "a strong conclusion can not be drawn from this exercise . if only skewness and kurtosis are present , the statistic @xmath37 developed by thomas & pierce ( 1979 )",
    "has more power than the rest of applied statistics .",
    "the presence of cumulants of order 5 and 6 seems to be better detected by the shapiro - francia test .",
    "several statistical methods have already been applied to the maxima data in the search for non gaussianity .",
    "wu et al . (",
    "2001 ) calculated moments , cumulants , minkowski functionals , kolmogorov and @xmath68 tests of the real and wiener filtered data as well as of the eigenmodes and signal - whitened data .",
    "santos et al . ( 2002 ) obtained the bispectrum value for these data . in both cases comparison with gaussian predictions confirmed the compatibility of the maxima data with gaussianity .",
    "we have added three more tests to the ones applied to maxima ( also see aliaga et al .",
    "( 2003 ) where constraints on @xmath9 snd @xmath10 are impossed based on that data ) .",
    "the tests are optimal in the case of non - correlated data .",
    "moreover , they can be applied even in cases in which the observations are not taken on a regular grid . as a first step in our method we have decorrelated the observations by multiplying by the inverse of the corresponding cholesky matrix .",
    "this is feasible in this case in which only a region of the whole sky was covered as any matrix operation is computationally very expensive .",
    "future application of these methods could in any case be done by decorrelating data region by region of the sky . for the case analysed in this work",
