    "inflation  @xcite is now the strongest candidate of the early universe scenario that explains current cosmological observations consistently .",
    "nonetheless , alternative scenarios deserve to be considered as well .",
    "first , in order to be convinced that inflation indeed occurred in the early stage of the universe , all other possibilities must be ruled out .",
    "second , even inflation can not resolve the problem of the initial singularity  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore well motivated to study how good and how bad alternative possibilities are compared to inflation .",
    "non - singular stages in the early universe , such as contracting and bouncing phases  @xcite , can not only be something that replaces inflation , but also `` early - time '' completion of inflation just to get rid of the initial singularity . in this paper",
    ", we address whether healthy non - singular cosmologies can be implemented in the framework of general scalar - tensor theories .",
    "if gravity is described by general relativity and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 of matter satisfies the null energy condition ( nec ) , that is , @xmath1 for every null vector @xmath2 , then ( assuming flat spatial sections ) it follows from the einstein equations that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the hubble parameter .",
    "this implies that an expanding universe yields a singularity in the past , while nec violation could lead to singularity - free cosmology .",
    "however , violating the nec in a healthy manner turns out to be challenging .",
    "the nec is by construction satisfied for a canonical scalar field , @xmath5 . in a general non - canonical scalar - field theory",
    "whose lagrangian is dependent on @xmath6 and its first derivative  @xcite , the nec can be violated , but nec - violating cosmological solutions are unstable because the curvature perturbation has the wrong sign kinetic term .",
    "galileon theory  @xcite and its generalizations  @xcite involve the scalar field whose lagrangian contains second derivatives of @xmath6 while maintaining the second - order nature of the equation of motion and thus erasing the ostrogradsky instability .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , it was found that the nec and the stability of cosmological solutions are uncorrelated in galileon - type theories  @xcite .",
    "this fact gives rise to healthy nec - violating models of galilean genesis  @xcite and stable non - singular bouncing solutions  @xcite , as well as novel dark energy and inflation models with interesting phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "see also a recent review  @xcite .",
    "although the galileon - type theories do admit a stable early stage without an initial singularity , the genesis / bouncing universe must be interpolated to a subsequent ( possibly conventional ) stage and the stable early stage does not mean that the cosmological solution is stable at all times during the whole history .",
    "several explicit examples  @xcite show that the sound speed squared of the curvature perturbation becomes negative at around the transition between the genesis / bouncing phase and the subsequent phase , leading to gradient instabilities . in some cases",
    "the universe can experience a healthy bounce , but then the solution has some kind of singularity in the past or future  @xcite . although the gradient instabilities can be cured by introducing higher spatial derivative terms  @xcite and there are some models in which the strong coupling scale cuts off the instabilities  @xcite , it would be preferable if the potential danger could be removed from the beginning . the next question to ask therefore",
    "is whether the appearance of instabilities is generic or a model - dependent nature . for general dilation invariant theories",
    "a no - go theorem was given in ref .",
    "( a counterexample was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it has an initial singularity . ) recently , it was clearly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that bouncing and genesis models suffer from instabilities or have singularities for the scalar - tensor theory whose lagrangian is of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ricci scalar .",
    "this lagrangian is widely used in the attempt to obtain non - singular stable cosmology .",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ kgb ] ) forms a subclass of the most general scalar - tensor theory with second - order field equations , i.e. , the horndeski theory  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this short paper is to generalize the no - go argument of ref .",
    "@xcite to the _ full _ horndeski theory .",

    "the scalar field is coupled to the ricci scalar @xmath8 and the einstein tensor @xmath12 in the particular way shown above .",
    "the structure of the lagrangian  ( [ hor_l ] ) guarantees the second - order nature of the field equations .",
    "the equations of motion governing the background cosmological evolution can be obtained by substituting @xmath13 and @xmath14 to the horndeski action and varying it with respect to @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath6  @xcite . in this paper , we only consider a spatially flat universe .",
    "linear perturbations around a spatially flat flrw spacetime in the horndeski theory were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . taking the unitary gauge , @xmath17 , the spatial part of the metric can be written as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the curvature perturbation and @xmath20 is the tensor perturbation .",

    "while @xmath25 and @xmath26 have more complicated dependence on the functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , the explicit forms of which are found in ref .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are smooth functions of time . to avoid ghost and gradient instabilities",
    ", we require that @xmath33 if @xmath6 is minimally coupled to gravity , we have @xmath34const and @xmath35 , and hence @xmath36const .",
    "in other words , the time evolution of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is caused by non - minimal coupling to gravity .",
    "the crucial point for the no - go argument is that @xmath25 is generically of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39 since @xmath40 is something written in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath4 , it is supposed to be a smooth function of time which is finite everywhere .",
    "this then implies that @xmath41 can never vanish except at a singularity , @xmath42 .",
    "the absence of gradient instabilities is equivalent to @xmath43 integrating eq .",
    "( [ st2 ] ) from some @xmath44 to @xmath45 , we obtain @xmath46 this is the key equation for the following argument , and it was used to prove the no - go theorem in the subclass of the horndeski theory with @xmath34const and @xmath35 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it turns out that essentially the same equation holds in the full horndeski theory .",
    "now , consider a non - singular universe which satisfies @xmath47const ( @xmath48 ) for @xmath49 and is expanding for large @xmath24 .",
    "the integral in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ key1 ] ) may be convergent or not as one takes @xmath50 and @xmath51 , depending on the asymptotic behavior of @xmath31 . to allow the integral to converge ,",
    "it is necessary that @xmath31 approaches zero sufficiently fast in the asymptotic past or future . for the moment",
    "let us focus on the case where the integral is not convergent .",
    "suppose that @xmath52 .",
    "equation  ( [ key1 ] ) reads @xmath53 since the integral is an increasing function of @xmath45 , the right hand side becomes negative for sufficiently large @xmath45 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath54 , which means that @xmath41 crosses zero . because @xmath25 is supposed to be smooth .",
    "( this means that @xmath40 can not cross zero . ) ] this is never possible in a non - singular universe .",
    "it is therefore necessary to have @xmath55 everywhere .",
    "writing eq .",
    "( [ key1 ] ) as @xmath56 we see that the right hand side will be positive for @xmath57 and hence @xmath52 .",
    "however , this is in contradiction to the assumption that @xmath41 is always positive .",
    "thus , we have generalized the no - go argument of ref .",
    "@xcite to the full horndeski theory .",
    "the same no - go theorem holds even in the presence of another field , provided at least that the field is described by @xmath58 which is not coupled to the horndeski field @xmath6 directly .",
    "now there are two degrees of freedom in the scalar sector of cosmological perturbations . in terms of @xmath59",
    "the quadratic action can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath60,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 with @xmath62 here , @xmath26 and @xmath25 were defined previously and @xmath63 is the sound speed of the @xmath64 field .",
    "we have the relation @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the energy density of @xmath64 and @xmath67 corresponds to the pressure of @xmath64 .",

    "the condition amounts to @xmath69 the propagation speed @xmath70 can be determined by solving @xmath71 yielding the condition for the absence of gradient instabilities , @xmath72 we thus have the inequality @xmath73 and taking the same way we can show the no - go theorem for the horndeski @xmath74 k - essence ( or a perfect fluid ) system .",
    "the no - go theorem we have thus established can be circumvented only if @xmath31 approaches zero sufficiently fast either in the asymptotic past or the future , given the assumption that the evolution of the scale factor is non-singular.const . ]",
    "the normalization of vacuum quantum fluctuations tells us that they would grow and diverge as @xmath75 , and hence the tensor sector is pathological in the asymptotic past or future .",
    ", which would offer a loophole .",
    "] in the next section , we will demonstrate that , in contrast to the cases in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is indeed possible to construct a model that exhibits a stable transition from the galilean genesis to inflation by allowing for some kind of pathology in the tensor sector due to vanishing @xmath31 .",
    "let us turn to study a specific setup as an example : galilean genesis followed by inflation .",
    "such an expansion history was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite as early - time completion of the inflationary universe , and there it was pointed out that the sound speed squared ( or more specifically @xmath25 ) becomes negative at the transition from the genesis phase to inflation .",
    "this is consistent with the no - go theorem , because in the genesis phase we have @xmath76const as @xmath77 and @xmath78const .",
    "the resultant gradient instability is cured by the introduction of higher order spatial derivatives arising in the effective field theory approach  @xcite or in theories beyond horndeski  @xcite .",
    "working within the second - order theory , i.e. , the horndeski theory , we are going to show in this section that the stable transition is indeed possible if @xmath75 as @xmath77 so that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ key1 ] ) is convergent . to do",
    "so it is more convenient to use the adm form of the action rather than the original covariant one  @xcite .",
    "the adm decomposition of the horndeski lagrangian leads to  @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80const hypersurfaces are taken to be constant time hypersurfaces , and @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are the extrinsic curvature , the ricci tensor , and the einstein tensor of the spatial slices .",
    "the functions of @xmath6 and @xmath84 in the covariant lagrangian are now the functions of @xmath24 and the lapse function @xmath15 .",
    "two of the six functions in the adm lagrangian  ( [ ladm ] ) are subject to the constraints @xmath85 in accordance with the fact that there are four arbitrary functions in the horndeski theory .",
    "the specific example we are going to study is given by the functions of the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is dependent only on @xmath24 , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constant parameters satisfying @xmath90 .",
    "this class of models is similar to but different from that in ref .",
    "the covariant form of the lagrangian can be recovered by re - introducing the scalar field , e.g. , through @xmath91 and @xmath92 and using the gauss - codazzi equations . in terms of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , ... , the lagrangian is written in a slightly more complicated form  @xcite . without moving to the covariant description",
