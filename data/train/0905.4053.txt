    "in this paper we consider smooth higher dimensional knots , that is , spheres @xmath5 smoothly embedded in @xmath6 . in @xmath6 we have the canonical cubulation @xmath1 by translates of the unit @xmath7-dimensional cube .",
    "we will call the @xmath0-skeleton @xmath3 of this cubulation the _ canonical scaffolding _ of @xmath6 ( see section 2 for precise definitions ) .",
    "we consider the question of whether it is possible to continuously deform the smooth knot by an ambient isotopy so that the deformed knot is contained in the scaffolding .",
    "in particular , a positive answer to this question implies that knots can be embedded as cubic sub - complexes of @xmath6 , which in turn implies the well - known fact that smooth knots can be triangulated by a pl triangulation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of embedding an abstract cubic complex into some skeleton of the canonical cubulation can be traced back to s.p .",

    "the possibility of considering a knot as a cubic submanifold contained in the @xmath0-skeleton of the canonical cubulation of @xmath6 has many advantages .",
    "for instance ,",
    "in the important case of classical knots @xmath8 , matveev and polyak @xcite begin the exposition of finite type invariants from the `` cubic '' point of view and show how one can clearly describe invariants such as polynomial invariants , vassiliev - goussarov invariants and finite type invariants of three - dimensional integer homology spheres ( in this regard see also the unpublished important paper by fenn , rourke and sanderson @xcite ) .",
    "cubic complexes may play a role in extending these invariants to higher dimensional knots .",
    "+ in this paper we prove that any smooth , compact , closed , @xmath0-dimensional submanifold of @xmath6 with trivial normal bundle can be continuously isotoped by an ambient isotopy of @xmath6 onto a cubic submanifold contained in @xmath3 .",

    "a _ cubulation _ of @xmath2 is a decomposition of @xmath2 into a collection @xmath1 of @xmath7-dimensional cubes such that any two of its hypercubes are either disjoint or meet in one common face of some dimension .",
    "this provides @xmath2 with the structure of a cubic complex . + in general ,",
    "the category of cubic complexes and cubic maps is similar to the simplicial category .",

    "any cubulation of @xmath2 is obtained by applying a conformal transformation @xmath15 to the canonical cubulation .",
    "+ in this section , we will prove that the union of the cubes of the canonical cubulation which intersect a fixed hyperplane is a closed tubular neighborhood of the hyperplane ( _ i.e. , _ a bicollar ) .",
    "hence the boundary of the union of these cubes has two connected components and therefore the hyperplane can be isotoped to any of them .",
