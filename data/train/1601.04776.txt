    "we consider the coupled rc circuit as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "two rc circuits of resistances and capacitances @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , are coupled through a third capacitance @xmath2 .",
    "the two rc circuits are subject to constant driven currents @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the voltage differences across the resistors are denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the equation of state of this circuit is @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the two resistors are thermalized at temperature @xmath10 , while voltages across the resistors fluctuate due to the johnson - nyquist ( thermal ) noises @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the noises are assumed to be uncorrelated and gaussian white , and they satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath13 with @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant .    via the change of variables @xmath17 , the equation of state can be rewritten as @xmath18 which is mathematically identical to that of a non - driven circuit .",
    "the solution of the stochastic equation is @xmath19 in our work we only focus on the steady - state condition , where the first term in eq .",
    "[ v_sol ] damps out .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ thm_fd ] and the fact that @xmath20 is symmetric , time - correlation functions between voltage signals can be derived as @xmath21 and variances and covariances are just their special cases when @xmath22 . using the method of diagonalization",
    ", we then derive @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the eigenvalues of @xmath26 ( @xmath24 is assigned as the larger one ) , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the @xmath31 element of the matrix @xmath26 . moreover , the correlations between @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be derived as @xmath34 ( no causality ) and @xmath35 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation of the full circuit can be shown to be @xmath36 + \\frac12 \\nabla \\cdot \\hat{\\bf{m}}^{-1 } \\hat{\\bf{\\gamma } } ( \\hat{\\bf{m}}^{-1})^{t } \\nabla p(\\vec{v},t)\\ , , \\ ] ] and the steady - state distribution of @xmath32 is @xmath37 for convenience we use the symbol `` @xmath38 '' to denote that the equality holds up to some normalizing constant that remains invariant in the time - reversal process .",
    "note that in the non - driven case the expression reduces to the boltzmann factor of the stored energy in capacitors .",

    "subsequently , the net dissipation can be shown to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents the currents through the two resistors .",
    "the corresponding change in shannon entropy is @xmath48 \\nonumber \\\\ & = 2k_b\\ , dt\\ , \\vec{v}'^t \\hat{\\bf{\\gamma}}^{-1 } \\hat{\\bf{m } } \\dot{\\vec{v}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the total entropy change @xmath49 is @xmath50 for our current discussions , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants , and therefore @xmath53 is a gaussian random variable , while @xmath54 .",
    "one can show that @xmath55 it is straightforward of average @xmath56 and width @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding symmetry function is @xmath58 = 2x_0 x/ \\sigma^2_x $ ] .",
    "thus gaussianity is a sufficient condition of the ft - like behavior .",
    "ft is valid if @xmath59 ( in dimensionless units ; in cases where @xmath60 means entropy then ft validates if @xmath61 ) , and for the case where the observed slope is not equal to 1 , ft can be easily restored with the rescaled variable @xmath62 . ] to demonstrate that ft holds for any gaussian random variable whose ratio of variance over mean value is @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , with the aid of time - correlation functions , one can also demonstrate the validity of ft over finite - time processes , where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "in the reduced descriptions , we neglect the signal @xmath6 intentionally , and we would like to check whether ft can still validate with the knowledge of @xmath5 only . note that since the current throught @xmath66 is not measured , the actual dissipation through the resistor is not known , while there exist many methods towards guessing an effective dissipation simply from the time series of @xmath5 . in this work",
    "we adopt two methods . in description ( a )",
    ", we treat the time series of @xmath5 as that from a virtual single - rc circuit , and compute the current and therefore dissipation directly following the equation of this simplified circuit . and in description ( b ) , an effective dissipation can be derived using the ratio of forward and backward transition probabilities in @xmath5 over infinitesimal timesteps .",
    "we first derive the steady - state probability distribution in @xmath5 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the effective capacitance .",
    "based on eq .",
    "[ ss_v1 ] , we can develop a naive interpretation ( `` description ( a ) '' ) , where the masked circuit is treated as a single - rc circuit with capacitance @xmath70 and unmodified @xmath66 ad @xmath3 .",
    "thus @xmath71 and @xmath4 are neglected intentionally .",
    "this effective single - rc circuit can give the correct steady - state distribution in @xmath5 .",
    "alternatively , one can regard the time series of @xmath5 as that from a single - rc circuit , as the effective resistance and capacitance can be derived from its power spectrum , which can be shown to be identical with @xmath66 and @xmath70 , respectively .    the total entropy change of this _ gedanken _ single - rc circuit , during an infinitesimal timestep , is @xmath72 where the first term on the rhs represents a `` virtual '' dissipation , as @xmath73 is the virtual current going through @xmath66 in this single - rc circuit . for the case of finite - time difference",
    "we have @xmath74 again one finds @xmath75 to be gaussian , while @xmath76 is the average virtual dissipation from @xmath66 . using time - correlation functions , it is straightforward to derive its variance : @xmath77   \\bigg\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\label{variance_ds1_a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , ft fails with the adoption of such dissipation function , even at the small-@xmath78 limit . nevertheless , from eq .",
    "[ variance_ds1_a ] one finds that this deviation becomes less prominent at large @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , one can also show that the deviation from ft diminishes in the weak - coupling regime , as the deviation in variance from @xmath79 is proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "beside the above reduced description , one can define the effective dissipation function starting from the forward transition probability of @xmath5 over infinitesimal timesteps .",
    "it can be derived by tracing out the degree of freedom in @xmath6 : @xmath81 ^ 2 \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\    & \\equiv \\exp [ - dt\\ , ( \\tilde{m } \\dot{v_1 } + v'_1)^2 / ( 2 \\tilde{\\gamma}_1 ) ]    \\label{p_f_v1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to the lowest nonvanishing order , where @xmath82 is a two - dimensional vector of elements @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "note that this transition probability can be compared to that of a single - rc circuit with the aforementioned effective capacitance @xmath69 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 . and the renormalized noise amplitude parameter is @xmath89 which is smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath91 = \\exp ( - \\tilde{m } v'^{\\ , 2}_1 / \\tilde{\\gamma}_1 ) $ ] , this effective single - rc circuit also gives the correct steady - state probability distribution in @xmath5 .    in this effective single - rc circuit , the reversed transition probability",
    "is derived simply by replacing @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 in eq .",
    "[ p_f_v1 ] .",

    "since @xmath97 is linear in @xmath5 and @xmath98 , the total entropy change is gaussian .",
