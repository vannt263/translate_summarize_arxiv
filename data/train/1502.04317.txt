    "one of the outstanding problems in contemporary elementary particle physics and cosmology is finding an explanation for the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of our universe , known as baryogenesis . within the framework of the big bang",
    ", it appears that a much greater degree of cp - violation than provided by the standard model of particle physics is required . that suggests the necessary existence of new physics ( np ) , with large cp - violating interactions as a key ingredient in understanding the early universe . identifying that np source , central to our very existence , would be a major intellectual achievement .    in the search for",
    "laboratory manifestations of new cp - violating effects , electric dipole moments ( edms ) play a crucial role . a non - zero permanent particle electric dipole moment ( edm )",
    "separately violates parity ( p ) and time reversal symmetry ( t )  @xcite .",
    "so , assuming cpt invariance , cp must also be violated .",
    "since standard model edm predictions are much smaller than current experimental sensitivities , an observation of any particle s edm with today s technology would signal discovery of np .",
    "if of sufficient strength , such a source could provide a possible explanation for baryogenesis .",
    "some theories , which suggest that an edm may be within experimental reach , include supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite , left - right symmetry  @xcite , and multi - higgs scenarios  @xcite . here",
    ", we explore the possibility of a storage ring search and study of the proton edm ( @xmath2 ) at the unprecedented level of @xmath3 , an advance by nearly 5 orders of magnitude beyond the current indirect bound of @xmath4 obtained using hg atoms  @xcite . observing the edm from different simple systems",
    "is necessary to identify the source of any np  @xcite .",
    "this dedicated direct proton edm study at the level of @xmath3 is sensitive to a generic np mass scale @xmath5 with cp - violating phase @xmath6 roughly satisfying  @xcite ( 3000  tev/@xmath7 . for a phase of the order of 45 degrees , the 3000  tev np scale",
    "is being probed , while for np generically parametrized by a scale of order 1  tev , a relative phase sensitivity as small as @xmath8 would be reached .",
    "many specific examples of the outstanding probing power of a proton edm study at the @xmath3 level exist . here , we point out that it constrains the @xmath9 parameter at @xmath10 , 3 orders of magnitude below the current neutron edm bounds .",
    "a more timely illustration in the current lhc era is a potential cp - violating chiral phase induced by a loop induced higgs to 2-photon coupling ( the relative pseudoscalar to scalar amplitudes , a measure of potential higgs cp - violation ) .",
    "such an effective coupling would lead to fermion edms via quantum loops , making for an overall effect of 2-loop order .",
    "the proton edm experimental program envisioned in this paper would be sensitive to a relative pseudoscalar coupling of order @xmath11 , about 2 orders of magnitude below current electron edm constraints .",
    "it should be noted that edms of the electron , proton and neutron may actually represent our only practical access to the very small higgs coupling to light ( first generation ) fermions , requiring of course the caveat that cp is violated at an observable level in the @xmath12 interaction .",
    "searching for a non - zero proton edm in a dedicated storage ring presents an experimental opportunity to improve the current sensitivity by more than three orders of magnitude compared to the current neutron edm experimental limit  @xcite .",
    "the method we describe is based on the frozen spin method and uses an all - electric lattice , directly measuring spin precession due to a non - zero edm in an electric field .",

    "we also present the systematic errors and the methods developed to address them .",
