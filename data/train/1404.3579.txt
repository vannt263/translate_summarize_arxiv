    "a deceptively simple but persistent problem in the analysis of cmes has been to find definite connections between the remote images of cmes @xcite , taken by coronagraph or heliospheric imager instruments , and the signatures of cmes in time series of plasma and magnetic field measurements taken directly ( in situ ) in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "current space - based coronagraphs on 3 different spacecraft ( _ stereo - a / cor1/cor2 , stereo - b / cor1/cor2 , and soho / lasco ) _ can image a cme in its entirety during its `` birth '' and early propagation phase ( @xmath11 solar radii ) .",

    "when a cme hits a spacecraft with in situ instruments onboard that are capable of characterizing the solar wind plasma and magnetic fields , it leads to distinct signatures in the time series of the measured parameters .",

    "however , these measurements of the in situ solar wind give a detailed but otherwise extremely limited and localized view of a cme at the position of the spacecraft near 1 au . at this distance ,",
    "a cme has already expanded into an enormous structure , covering up to around 100@xmath10  in heliocentric longitude and several tenths of an au along the radial direction to the sun @xcite .",
    "thus , progressing further from the sun leads to less and less information on the global structure of the cme , which is increasingly hard to interpret , providing a first explanation for the difficulties in linking the datasets .    as a background to our study",
    ", it needs to be understood that cmes are almost never really single entities , but they react to their coronal and heliospheric environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite state a picture of sun  to  earth propagation of fast cmes , derived from a joint analysis using stereoscopic heliospheric images , radio and in situ observations of three cme events : fast cmes impulsively accelerate close to the sun , followed by a rapid deceleration out to about 0.4   au , culminating in an almost constant speed propagation phase ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for earlier , similar ideas ) .",
    "our paper addresses the problem of seamlessly connecting cmes from the sun to 1 au in two ways .",
    "first , we establish a list of suitable cme events from 2008 - 2012 , using observations by coronagraphs , heliospheric imagers and in situ instruments onboard the _ stereo _ and wind spacecraft , and model the imaging observations using single - spacecraft state - of - the - art-``geometrical modeling '' methods .",
    "secondly , we use these connections to enhance our understanding of cme propagation and their prediction , focusing on the improvement of methods to extract cme parameters from heliospheric imager data .",
    "our study builds on the results of @xcite , who analyzed cmes in _ stereo / hi _ data that impacted the other _ stereo _ spacecraft during the interval 20082010 .",
    "this study established that predictions of speeds and arrival times for slow cmes are roughly consistent with corresponding in situ parameters , and demonstrated the possibility for succesfully predicting cmes that propagate behind the limb or on the backside of the sun as viewed from hi . however",
    ", our paper goes further along several , critical avenues : we included modeling with the new self - similar expansion fitting ( ssef ) technique @xcite , which allows more flexibility for the cme width in the solar equatorial plane than previous models , which were either point - like ( fixed-@xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or extremely wide ( harmonic mean , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , we now have _ stereo _ data of very fast cmes ( @xmath12  km  s@xmath0 ) available , and we mainly discuss earth - directed events .",
    "the _ stereo _ separation from earth increased from 22@xmath10  in early 2008 to 120@xmath10  in mid 2012 , thus we include in our study backsided events ( from the point of view of a _ stereo _ spacecraft ) , similar to @xcite .    several lines of research have recently converged to make this work possible , apart from having available the remote _ stereo _ observatories in conjunction with the wind spacecraft ( the latter at the sun - earth lagrangian 1 or l1 point ) : ( 1 ) the existence of software packages ( i.e. , _ satplot _ and croissant modeling ) to easily extract and fit cmes in _",
    "stereo / cor2 _ and hi data , ( 2 ) the development of mature models to obtain cme speeds and directions from heliospheric imagers , and ( 3 ) the rise of solar cycle 24 which culminated in several very fast coronal mass ejections .",
    "all this now gives us the opportunity to study the potentially most geoeffective events with multi  point in situ and imaging data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the connections established in our paper may be used by other researchers to benchmark any empirical or numerical propagation model of cmes .",
    "we need to emphasize that our paper focuses on establishing connections between the datasets , which means that we track cmes as far as possible through the hi data , up to 3040@xmath10  elongation from the sun . for this reason the prediction lead times , which are the differences between the last data points used for extracting cme parameters , and the actual in situ arrival times , are relatively short , of the order of one day .",
    "this should be kept in mind when discussing our results for the errors in cme speeds and arrival times .",
    "shorter tracks in hi must be used in order to increase the prediction lead time to values suitable for real time forecasting , namely from more than one day for fast cmes to several days for slow cmes .",
    "such an analysis was carried out by @xcite for a case study , and is the aim of future studies that will exploit our full dataset , consisting of 22 cme events .",
    "the differences in speeds and arrival times that we derive from comparing the hi data to the in situ data thus show how well a hi system configured as on _ stereo _ can perform for cme forecasting .",
    "this section illustrates the observations and models we used to extract cme parameters from various imaging and in situ data .",
    "we chose the events in our list by the criteria that each cme has ( 1 ) clear in situ signatures and ( 2 ) a clear track in j - maps from one _ stereo / hi _ instrument .",
    "we then tracked back the cme in the hi j - map to the coronagraph images to find the corresponding cme observations in the corona .",
    "we do not attempt to provide a full list of all cmes directed towards earth and _ stereo _ during the time between april 2008 and july 2012 .",
    "however , some of the brightest , fastest and best - studied events in this time - range show up in our list .",
    "a well observed , earth - directed cme that left the sun on 2012 july 12 and arrived at earth on 2012 july 14 serves to demonstrate our data pipeline .      the so - called `` croissant '' model ,",
    "also known as `` graduated cylindrical shell '' ( gcs ) model , is a very well tested tool , available in the _ idl solarsoft _ package , for deriving the initial directions and speeds of cmes in the fields of view of the _ stereo / cor2 _ coronagraph , covering 2.515.6 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "at least two viewpoints are needed .",
    "sometimes , the additional viewpoint of the _ soho / lasco _ c2 and c3 coronagraphs at the near - earth l1 point is used , to either give the second view or to provide a third .",
    "c2 and c3 , combined , cover a distance of 1.530 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the model has also been recently extended for the fields of view of heliospheric imaging @xcite , but we will use it in the classic way for analyzing coronagraph images only . essentially , the model approximates the cme shape as a bent tube which is reminiscent of a croissant , with the mass distributed uniformly on its surface .",
    "this shape was chosen to be consistent with a geometry of the cme internal magnetic field as a bent , cylindrical magnetic flux rope .",
    "the application of the model consists of manually adjusting parameters that define the cme shape and direction to best fit images of the cme provided by coronagraphs .",
    "the major advantage of using this model is that it provides reliable results for the initial 3d propagation direction and initial speed of a cme , free of projection effects .",
    "the downside is that not every cme can be approximated by the shape of a croissant , and often cmes occur within a few hours of each other , making it difficult to distinguish the different physical parts of each cme .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite found that , close to the sun , at least @xmath14% of cmes possessed a flux - rope like structure .",
    "we refer the reader to an extensive discussion on the morphology of cmes in coronagraphs that is provided by those authors .    as an example",
    ", the top row in figure  [ croissant_july ] shows images of the 2012 july 12 17:24 ut cme , and the bottom row a green grid of the croissant model overlaid on the same images .",
    "it can be seen that the croissant represents the shape of the cme well in all 3 viewpoints .",
    "it becomes clear that this cme is roughly directed towards the earth , appearing as a full halo in _",
    "soho / lasco _ , and being directed to solar west from _ stereo - b _ , and to solar east from _ stereo - a_. to get the cme initial speed @xmath15 , we linearly fit height - time measurements for the croissant s apex over a few data points ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , @xmath15 is an average speed between 2.515.6 @xmath13 .",
    "the initial cme direction is similarly obtained by adjusting the wire - grid model to the images , and averages over a few data points define the initial cme direction in heliocentric longitude ( @xmath16 ) in the solar equatorial plane , with the earth as a reference point at  0@xmath10  longitude .",
    "common errors associated with croissant modeling are @xmath1710@xmath10  in heliocentric longitude for the cme propagation direction , and @xmath1710% of the average cme speed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we have used 3 viewpoints ( _ stereo - a / b _ and _ soho _ ) , and for the other events the 2 viewpoints as provided by _ stereo - a / b_. for earth - directed cmes , which appear symmetric in _ stereo - a / b _ , an additional viewpoint provides more reliable results @xcite .",

    "the pa is measured from solar north ( 0@xmath10 ) to east ( 90@xmath10 ) , south ( 180@xmath10 ) and west ( 270@xmath10 ) .",
    "consequently , when using _ stereo - a(b ) _ images , a pa of around 90@xmath10",
    "( 270@xmath10 ) should be chosen to obtain measurements in the solar equatorial plane , which is also close to the ecliptic plane where the in situ observations are made .    in reality",
    ", cmes often propagate away from the solar equatorial plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their signature is too faint around pa=90@xmath10 . for such cme events we choose a pa between 77@xmath10  and 95@xmath10 , depending at which pa we were able to capture the cme front clearly .",
    "for the j - map in figure  [ summary_july]a , pa=80@xmath10 , using data taken within @xmath19@xmath10  of this pa .",
    "this is also the reason that we will not further distinguish between measurements in the solar equatorial plane ( valid for the croissant results ) and ecliptic plane ( valid for in situ results ) , because the hi data connecting the solar to in situ measurements are not exactly taken in either of these planes .",
    "this does not affect our conclusions because the resulting systematic error in heliocentric longitude of a few degrees is much lower than the differences between cme directions given by the different hi models , of the order of @xmath20@xmath10 .",

    "it is important to emphasize that these methods are all used for a _ single - spacecraft hi observer_. essentially , all of these models are based on purely geometrical considerations , and use the concept that deceptive acceleration and deceleration arises in @xmath21 , depending on the speed and direction of the cme with respect to the hi observer ( see , for example , extensive descriptions in * ? ? ?",

    "the fpf model assumes a point - like cme without any extension in heliocentric longitude ( the dot - dashed red line ) .",
    "the hmf model is shown as a very wide blue circle , with @xmath22@xmath10 , where @xmath23 is the cme half width ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ssef model can be seen as a generalization of the fpf and hmf models , because @xmath23 can vary anywhere between 0 and 90@xmath10 , which correspond to fpf and hmf , respectively . in our analysis ,",
    "every result for the ssef model uses a half width of @xmath24@xmath10 , as this forms the average value between the other two models .",
    "it is illustrated by the green circle in figure  [ summary_july]c .",
    "for the longitudinally extended hmf and ssef models , the speed to be compared to the in situ speed is not the apex speed from the geometrical model ( @xmath25 ) , but a different speed calculated for the point on the cme model front that is directed towards the in situ observatory .",
    "we call it @xmath26 , for interplanetary ( ip ) speed toward the observer ( o ) . in figure",
    "[ summary_july]c , this point is the intersection of the green ssef circle with the sun - earth line , close to earth . for the fpf model a point - like cme shape is assumed , and it is not possible to differentiate between the two speeds .",
    "the speeds @xmath26 can be calculated by knowing the apex speed and the difference in heliocentric longitude between the cme apex in the model and the position of the in situ spacecraft .",
    "the corresponding formulas are derived and summarized by @xcite .",
    "there is an error associated with manual measurements of cme fronts in j - maps , which is on the order of @xmath170.5@xmath10  in elongation angle @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "depending on the length of the @xmath21 track , this error will propagate into the results of the geometrical models .",
    "in general , we tracked each cme to about 35@xmath10  elongation from the sun , because this is a range for which the fitting methods are known to give relatively well constrained results @xcite.because the tracks need to cover a large range in elongation for the fitting techniques to work , the methods can not be applied to coronagraph measurements .",
    "concerning interplanetary cme directions , @xmath170.5@xmath10  in @xmath21 translates to an error of @xmath27@xmath10  for cmes tracked further than 30@xmath10  elongation from the sun @xcite .",

    "july 15 0600 ut , at the second solid vertical line , this region ends and the interval of a magnetic cloud @xcite begins , which extends about 48 hours up to early july 17 , where a third vertical line signals the end of the cloud .",

    "geocentric solar ecliptic _",
    "( _ gse _ ) coordinates , and low proton temperature .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not discuss magnetic cloud geometry further in this paper , but , for completeness , in this case the field rotates from solar east ( @xmath35 ) to south of the ecliptic ( @xmath36 ) to solar west ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this cloud is of east - south - west ( esw ) type @xcite , and its axis is consequently roughly normal to the ecliptic plane pointing southward .",
    "also shown are the results for arrival times and speeds by the geometrical modeling methods ( `` ssef corr . ''",
    "will be explained in section 3.2 ) .",
    "the fact that they are accurate to within a few hours of the observed arrival time at the location of earth establishes the connection from the remote hi data to the in situ data near 1 au .    in table 2 , columns 59 , we present in situ results for every icme event in our dataset , derived from similar plots .",
    "these parameters are : ( column 5 ) the arrival time @xmath38 of the shock , or , if no shock is present , the arrival time of a significant jump in proton density , ( 6 ) the average proton bulk speed @xmath39 inside the sheath region , and its standard deviation , ( 7 ) the average proton density @xmath40 inside the sheath , and its standard deviation , ( 8) the maximum magnetic field @xmath41 in the full icme interval ( consisting of shock , sheath , and any magnetic structure ) , ( 9 ) the minimum value of the southward component of the magnetic field ( min @xmath42 ) in the full icme interval .",
    "some of these parameters act as an independent check on the validity of the results of the hi models , and highlight differences between the datasets when connecting cme observations from the sun to 1 au .    for this comparison , most relevant are the average proton bulk speed inside the icme sheath region and the arrival time of the shock .",
    "the reason that we choose these parameters is that previous research has shown that the density , which is mapped by the hi instrument , and which shows up as a high density `` track '' in j - maps , corresponds to the region of enhanced plasma density in the icme sheath ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , tracking the leading edge of a cme in a j - map essentially means tracking the front of the sheath region , which is the location of the shock .",
    "hence , the predicted arrival time from geometrical modeling corresponds to the shock arrival time observed in situ , and @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath39 .",
    "these in situ parameters are excellently suitable to act as target values for understanding the performance and limitations of the geometrical models , because they are very well defined , and have very small intrinsic errors .",
    "the arrival time of the shock can be pinpointed usually to within a few minutes accuracy , which is negligible when compared to the several hour error in arrival time prediction . for very slow ( @xmath43 km  s@xmath0 ) cmes , where no shock is usually present , the in situ arrival time can be defined by the start of a high density region in front of the magnetic structure , to an uncertainty of @xmath28 hours .",
    "this definition was necessary only for the events with numbers 4 and 10 in our list .",
    "the speed @xmath39 ( column 6 in table 2 ) has an average standard deviation of @xmath44 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this is only 5% of the average sheath speed of 485 km  s@xmath0 , so it is also a well constrained quantity .",
    "in this section , we discuss the results from an analysis of all the parameters that we described in the previous section for the full set of 22 different cme events . for the 2008 june 17 cme , there are two tracks in hi , one for the leading and one for the trailing edge , enveloping a magnetic flux rope @xcite , thus we have two hi / in situ comparisons for a single cme . additionally , for the cme on 2010 august 14 , in situ data are available from the _ wind _ and _ stereo - b _ spacecraft , which observed different parts of the same shock front associated with the fastest and largest of several cmes launched on the sun on 2010 august 1 @xcite . in total , we end up with 24 different comparisons of imaging to in situ data .",
    "to track cmes in hi data , we use _ stereo - a _ for 21 events and _ stereo - b _ for 1 event because of the slightly higher image quality for _ stereo - a _ and some data gaps for _ stereo - b_. the imaging parameters are summarized in table  1 , and the in situ parameters are given in table  2 .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the comparison between cme parameters derived from the different imaging methods of croissant and geometrical modeling ( table  1 ) . essentially , we look for consistency between the cme speed and direction in the outer corona ( @xmath45 or 0.07  au ) and in the interplanetary medium ( roughly up to 0.85 au , see section 3.2.2 for details on the distance range ) .",
    "the initial directions and speeds of the cmes are very well defined in the corona , as they are constrained by multi - view point imaging ; this serves as a point of reference .",
    "figure [ direction_all]a shows the initial directions @xmath16 in the solar equatorial plane of all cmes in our dataset , with the length of the arrow refering to the initial speed , both derived from the croissant model . in the time between the first event in 2008 april and the last event in 2012 july , _ stereo - a _ separated itself from earth from 25@xmath10  to 120@xmath10 .",
    "it can be seen that for our specific set of events , the fastest cmes tended to be launched about 30@xmath10  east and west of earth , and only a few events were initially directed centrally toward earth .",
    "figure [ direction_all]b illustrates the interplanetary directions from ssef modeling ( @xmath33 ) , relative to the hi observer , which is at the fixed longitude of 0@xmath10 .",
    "the length of the arrow corresponds to the interplanetary speed of the ssef circle s apex ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this figure demonstrates the important point that the fastest cmes in our dataset were all backsided from the vantage point of the hi observer , and that the slow events were mainly frontsided .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the weak solar cycle 24 , which resulted in cmes which had well over 1000 km  s@xmath0 only after the end of 2011 . by this time ,",
    "the two _ stereo _ spacecraft had already reached a mutual separation greater than 180@xmath10  .",
    "figure [ direction_polar ] compares the cme directions from croissant modeling , @xmath16 , to those from each geometrical model , @xmath46 .",
    "each panel presents an angular histogram of @xmath47 with bins of 15@xmath10  width ; @xmath16 is at 0@xmath10  longitude .",
    "the black arrow is the average @xmath48 .",
    "there is considerable scatter ; as an example , 90% of interplanetary directions given by fpf are within @xmath49@xmath10  of the croissant direction .",
    "the black arrow on each histogram shows that , on average , the croissant direction is consistent with fpf modeling to within a few degrees , whereas for the ssef and hmf models , there is a bias in direction which increases with larger cme width .",
    "it results in an average difference in 30@xmath10  longitude between croissant and hmf directions .",
    "because almost all events are observed by _ stereo - a _ , which is positioned to the west of earth and looks towards solar east , the resulting direction bias is towards solar east or angles @xmath50@xmath10 .",
    "this means that the ssef and hmf methods places the cme apex further away from the hi observer .",
    "@xcite showed theoretically that this behaviour ultimately results from the constant speed assumption of the models , because the real deceleration of a fast cme in the interplanetary medium is interpreted by the models as geometrical deceleration , which means a change in direction as compared to a cme which is not decelerating .",
    "@xcite argued that the fpf model is in this way superior to the others , because the error resulting from neglecting deceleration is cancelled by neglecting the cme width .",
    "we confirm this relationship from the observations in our dataset in figure  [ direction_difference ] , where we plot the interplanetary speed @xmath25 against the difference in direction from the two extreme models fpf and hmf : @xmath51 .",
    "higher interplanetary speeds are clearly correlated with larger differences in direction .",
    "we also quote linear relationships on the plot from which the resulting fpf ",
    "hmf direction difference @xmath52 can be estimated , if @xmath25 is already known from one of the geometrical models .",
    "we can take away from this section that connecting cme directions from the corona to the interplanetary medium works to within 30@xmath10  in heliocentric longitude . however , the models that feature an extended cme width ( ssef and hmf ) and which are at first glance more mature than the point - like fpf model , produce systematically biased directions for fast cmes .",
    "figure [ speeds_cor_hi ] plots the relationship between the initial ( @xmath15 ) and the interplanetary ( @xmath25 ) cme speed of the model apex . for each @xmath15 ,",
    "the three different speeds by the geometrical models are shown .",
    "the black dashed line indicates where @xmath53 .",
    "we linearly fitted the data for each geometrical model separately .",
    "these linear fits work well for this relationship , and they allow one speed to be estimated if the other is known",
    ". they result in :    @xmath54    with both speeds in km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the fpf method yields a deceleration between the corona and the interplanetary medium ( ip ) , with the slope of the linear fit indicating @xmath55 .",
    "when using ssef , the deceleration is less ( @xmath56 ) , and for hmf , the speed remains approximately constant , @xmath57 . here",
    ", again , our physical interpretation depends highly on which models we use , and thus these relationships are most useful for understanding the biases inherent in the different techniques .",
    "nevertheless , taking these results at face value and knowing from theoretical considerations @xcite that fpf should give more accurate results for fast cmes , a deceleration of cmes from the corona to the ip medium seems to be the most realistic conclusion .",
    "furthermore , concerning another quantitative link between the _ cor2 _ and hi data sets , we checked whether the launch time @xmath58 resulting from the geometrical models is consistent with the time @xmath59 ( see table  1 ) of the first image of the cme in _",
    "cor2_. the launch time is defined as the time when the fitting function @xmath60 @xcite . the average difference @xmath61  hours , and for @xmath62 of all events it is @xmath63hours .",
    "this means that the launch time is an excellent proxy for linking a cme track , which was extracted and from hi j - maps and modeled , to its coronal counterpart , provided that only one cme is launched during this time window .      in this section",
    "we discuss the link between the icme in situ data and the speeds and arrival times derived from the hi observations .",
    "the cme direction can not be compared to in situ because there is no simple way to derive the principal direction of an icme from in situ data .",
    "this might be possible with deeper investigations on orientations of the shocks and flux ropes inside the icmes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this is beyond the scope of the current study .",
    "we first focus on a comparison of speeds . for the heliospheric imager data , these are the speeds toward the in situ observer ( @xmath26 ) derived from the three geometrical models ( fpf , hmf , ssef ) . for the in situ icme data , these are the average proton bulk speeds in the icme sheath regions ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "figure [ speed_bar ] shows the difference @xmath64 for each event included in our study .",
    "note that the speed @xmath26 already includes a correction to account for which part of the cme front impacts the spacecraft .",
    "it is clearly seen that for most slow cmes in the sample , until late 2011 , there is a relatively good consistency . for fpf , in 42 % of events the absolute difference @xmath65  km  s@xmath0 ( ssef : 54 % ; hmf : 50% ) .",
    "this means that for about half of the events there is a reasonable match between the imaging and in situ speeds .",
    "however , most ip speeds exceed the in situ ones . for fpf ,",
    "87 % of events are faster in the ip medium than when observed in situ ( ssef : 75 % , hmf 83 % ) .",
    "this is most evident for the fast cmes in our sample , those with initial speeds @xmath66  km  s@xmath0 , for which the predicted in situ speeds are strongly overestimated ( consistent with * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on the order of 500 to 1000 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "these are the events on the right side of figure [ speed_bar ] .",
    "the geometrical models yield an average interplanetary propagation speed of a cme . especially for very fast cmes",
    ", these speeds will not match the speeds measured in situ at 1 au because of the cme deceleration that occurs up to 1 au ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in essence , the assumption of constant speed in the geometrical models is at the root of this discrepancy .",
    "table  3 summarizes the @xmath67 obtained with the different methods . on average",
    ", @xmath68 is 303  km  s@xmath0  ( fpf ) , 267  km  s@xmath0  ( ssef ) and 282  km  s@xmath0  ( hmf ) .",
    "taking the average over these values gives 284  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we can also see that the differences between the geometrical models are only about 40  km  s@xmath0 , which makes it impossible to state which one performs best . in table  3",
    "we also state the results of a comparison @xmath69 , which means that we just use the cme model apex speed without a correction for the position of the in situ observer .",
    "this results in an average difference over all models of 431  km  s@xmath0 . consequently , correcting for apex or flank encounters strongly enhances the consistency with in situ data , for the present set of events on average by @xmath70  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "however , this is likely caused by the effect that a flank speed is invariably lower than the apex speed , simulating to some degree the effect of real cme deceleration .",
    "but even when using @xmath26 , the average difference to the in situ speeds is still too large , almost 300  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "it becomes clear that we need to introduce some kind of correction to the interplanetary speeds to be able to better predict the in situ speed from heliospheric images .",
    "figure [ speed_scatter ] presents the interplanetary speed ( @xmath26 ) in the direction of the in situ observatory against the icme sheath region speed ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "separate linear fits for each geometrical model are shown in corresponding colors .",
    "these fits are very similar to each other . with the coefficients from these fits",
    ", we can apply an empirical correction to the speed @xmath26 for each model , to get a better proxy for the speed of the in situ sheath region , which we call @xmath71 or a `` corrected '' speed : @xmath72 with both speeds given in km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we use this formula to obtain corrected sheath speeds based on @xmath26 , and compare them again to the in situ observed @xmath39 .",
    "returning to figure  [ speed_bar ] , the pink bars show the comparison @xmath73 , for the ssef method only .",
    "it can be seen that the consistency with @xmath39 greatly improves , for both slow and fast cmes . on average ,",
    "@xmath74  km  s@xmath0  ( fpf ) , 53  km  s@xmath0  ( ssef ) and 57  km  s@xmath0  ( hmf ) ; see again table  3 for a summary . for the whole dataset , for fpf , the absolute difference @xmath75  km  s@xmath0 in 92 % of cases ( ssef : 83 % ; hmf : 88% )",
    "this is an improvement over more than 200 km  s@xmath0 compared to geometrical modeling without this empirical correction .",
    "clearly , the caveat of this correction is that we derived it from the current set of events , and the results will change for a different set of cmes .",
    "nevertheless , it definitely results in an improvement in the prediction capability compared to using the geometrical models alone , and should also be used in future studies .    in summary ,",
    "the average difference between cme speeds predicted from geometrical modeling to in situ icme sheath region speeds are , for all methods , using @xmath25 , @xmath76 km  s@xmath0 ; using @xmath26 , @xmath77 km  s@xmath0 , and using @xmath71 , @xmath78 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the differences between the different geometricals model are negligible , so none can be claimed as performing significantly better than the other .      before we move on to discuss similar comparisons of icme arrival times , we first need to clearly state the range of distances in the interplanetary medium that are covered by the _ stereo / hi _ observations . using j - maps created by the _ satplot _ software , we tracked every cme event out to about 3040@xmath10  elongation from the sun . rather than elongation , we need to know the corresponding distance range in au to see how far from the sun we have actually tracked the front of each cme .",
    "the average elongation value of the last hi data point of each cme is @xmath79@xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding distance to the maximum elongation is calculated by @xmath80 .",
    "this means that we propagate the cme away from the sun with the interplanetary speed of the model apex , from the launch time to the last time of hi observation ( @xmath81 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we state the result as a mean and standard deviation for all cmes for the ssef model only , because it is intermediate between the fpf and hmf models .",
    "the average maximum distance of the cme apex from the sun , over all cmes , is @xmath82  au ( ssef ) .",
    "the maximum value is 1.41 au , and the minimum 0.48 au .",
    "the maximum apex distance for some events is @xmath83  au , especially for those cases where the cme flank hits the in situ spacecraft , which is situated near 1 au . +      we focus on connecting cmes in different datasets , so we track the cmes in the hi data for as long as possible .",
    "but we can also ask ourselves how useful the results will be for forecasting the in situ parameters . for this",
    "it is necessary to place the parameters that we have calculated from remote images , and their comparison to in situ observations , into the context of space weather prediction .",
    "a very important parameter in this respect is the prediction lead time ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this is the difference between the actual in situ arrival time of the icme , and the time ( @xmath81 ) when a prediction for its arrival was issued . in our study ,",
    "the latter is again the last point at which the event was observed by hi ( i.e. , the last point clicked in a j - map ) ; of course here we are not discussing real time predictions but artificial `` predictions '' made long after the events have happened , derived from a pre - existing dataset .",
    "we define @xmath85 , where @xmath38 is the actual icme arrival time . with this definition , prediction times earlier than the actual arrival",
    "give a @xmath86 , as desirable when really `` predicting '' cmes . over our dataset , on average , @xmath87  hours , with a minimum @xmath84 for any individual event of @xmath88  hours ( @xmath89 days ) , and a maximum of @xmath90h .",
    "for the latter , @xmath91 was already later than the in situ arrival time . hence , the results that we state for arrival times and speeds are valid for a prediction lead time of the order of one day , albeit with considerable scatter around this value .",
    "we also need to point out that we have used hi science data , which are of better quality than those available from _ stereo _ in real time .",
    "figure [ arrival_bar ] is a bar chart showing , for all cmes , the difference @xmath92 between predicted cme arrival time and the observed icme arrival time taken from the in situ measurements . here",
    ", @xmath93 is the predicted arrival time from heliospheric imaging , derived by the following expression ( similar to * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , @xmath94 where @xmath58 is the launch time , as discussed above , @xmath95 is the heliocentric distance of the in situ spacecraft , and @xmath26 the ( assumed constant ) cme speed in the direction of the in situ observatory .    in figure",
    "[ arrival_bar ] , values of @xmath96 refer to the situation where the predicted arrival time is before the in situ arrival time .",
    "this is the case in particular for the events after october 2011 , on the right hand side of figure [ arrival_bar ] , which are all backsided events , from the hi observer point of view , as determined by the ssef direction .",
    "even so , the fastest cmes after october 2011 have a reasonable @xmath97  h , but this is mainly due to the fact that fast cmes have a transit time of the order of 2040 hours , compared to around 100 hours for slower events . in general , we find @xmath98 is of the order of 10% of the total cme transit time .",
    "however , all three methods predict arrival times that are one day early for slow and backsided cmes ( e.g. 2012 april 19 with @xmath99  km  s@xmath0 ) , consistent with theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "there is considerable scatter around @xmath100 , and for a specific event , different methods can give quite different arrival times .",
    "the maximum and minimum values of @xmath98 are about @xmath101  day , while the average absolute values of @xmath102h for the fpf model ( ssef : @xmath103h ; hmf : @xmath104h ; @xmath4h over all methods ) .",
    "results are summarized in table  3 , including averages of signed values of @xmath105 .",
    "we have derived corrections to the arrival times , using a similar approach as for correcting the speed predictions , but independent of the results for the speeds .",
    "figure  [ arrival_scatter ] is a scatter plot of the interplanetary speed @xmath26 versus @xmath98 , for each cme and for all three methods .",
    "faster interplanetary speeds tend to be correlated with lower values of @xmath98 , attributable again to the constant speed assumption used in geometrical modeling .",
    "faster cmes are predicted to arrive before they actually do , because modeling a fast and decelerating cme assuming a constant speed results in a much higher speed than the final in situ speed , as we have shown in the previous section .",
    "similar to what was done in figure  [ speed_scatter ] , we fit the data points in figure  [ arrival_scatter ] for each model independently with a simple , linear relationship .",
    "the results of these fits are : @xmath106 with @xmath107 in hours and @xmath26 in km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this allows to make an empirical correction ( that we call `` version  1 '' ) to the arrival time from our knowledge of @xmath26 alone . to this end",
    ", we calculate a corrected arrival time by @xmath108 using @xmath107 from the fit for the corresponding geometrical model .",
    "the result of such a calculation for the ssef model is shown using pink bars in figure  [ arrival_bar ] .",
    "on average , it improves the prediction performance by 2 hours . comparing corrected arrival times to in situ arrival times results in @xmath109h for the fpf model ( ssef : @xmath110h ; hmf : @xmath111h ) .",
    "the average over all models is @xmath7h , compared to 8.1 hours without the empirical correction ( see table  3 ) .",
    "there is another way to calculate cme arrival times which performs slightly better than the straightforward arrival time calculation using geometrical modeling , as stated in equation  ( [ eq : arrival ] ) .",
    "we have applied this new method , that we call `` version 2 '' , which also depends only on @xmath26 , to our list of events .",
    "we define a cme s transit time @xmath112 as the time difference between its first appearance in coronagraph images ( @xmath18 ) , and its actual in situ arrival time @xmath38 .",
    "this definition of @xmath112 covers a distance range from @xmath113 , which is the inner boundary of _ stereo / cor2 _ , to 1  au or @xmath114 .",
    "figure  [ arrival_transit ] shows a relationship between @xmath112 and interplanetary speeds ( @xmath26 ) for all cmes in our dataset . for each geometrical model",
    ", we fit a power law to the data , quoting the results on the plot . for ssef ,",
    "the resulting power law is : @xmath115 with @xmath26 given in km  s@xmath0 , and @xmath116 in hours .",
    "similar relationships have been shown for example by @xcite and @xcite , but using cme coronagraph speeds , whereas we show interplanetary speeds .",
    "they include to some extent the cme propagation through the background solar wind .",
    "the average transit time in our dataset is around 72 hours ( or 3 days ) , which compares well to the classic @xcite 80 hour rule for average cme transit times .",
    "these power laws allow us to predict the arrival time , based solely on the interplanetary speed in direction of the in situ observatory @xmath26 , by    @xmath117    for simplicity , we do not show resulting arrival time differences @xmath98 for each event , but only summarize the resulting values . for this method ,",
    "the difference between predicted and in situ arrival times is @xmath118h for the fpf model ( ssef : @xmath119h ; hmf : @xmath120h ) .",
    "the average for all models is @xmath121 hours , almost as good as for the empirically corrected arrival times ( 6.1 hours ) .",
    "the last step in our analysis concerns the relationship between the maximum magnetic field @xmath122 in the full icme interval ( column  8 in table 2 ) , consisting of shock , sheath and ejecta parts , and the interplanetary speed @xmath26 in the direction of the in situ observatory , as derived from hi geometrical modeling .",
    "cmes that have higher speeds close to the sun are known to be correlated with stronger magnetic fields at in situ spacecraft ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is thought to arise from the role played by magnetic reconnection during cme eruption , namely through a possible formation of their interior magnetic flux rope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another explanation is that faster cmes lead to stronger compression of the ambient solar wind , which results in a higher magnetic field strength in the icme sheath region @xcite . around half of the icmes in our dataset",
    "reach their @xmath122 in the sheath and the other half in their interior magnetic ejecta , so both effects can be expected to play a role in our analysis . in the same way as we have done for the transit times above , we can extend such previously found relationships by comparing interplanetary rather than coronal cme speeds to the in situ magnetic field magnitude .    figure  [ magnetic_relation ] shows , as a scatter plot , that stronger icme maximum magnetic fields are correlated with faster interplanetary cme speeds .",
    "again , we perform independent , linear fits for each model , which , for ssef , results in @xmath123 with @xmath124 in nt , and @xmath26 in km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the average , absolute difference @xmath125 between predicted and observed maximum magnetic fields , based on the speeds from fpf , is @xmath126  nt ( ssef : 4.7 nt ; hmf : 4.4 nt ) .",
    "use of the resulting linear fits for @xmath127 for each model results in a successful prediction of @xmath122 to within @xmath28  nt for 58  % of events with the fpf method ( ssef : 67% ; hmf 71% ) .",
    "the same numbers for predictions within @xmath30  nt are 88 % for fpf ( ssef : 88% ; hmf 92% ) . in summary",
    ", for around 2 out of 3 events in our sample , the maximum magnetic field in the icme interval could be predicted within a precision of 5 nt , solely based on the interplanetary cme speed .",
    "we have presented a study in which we have connected white light to in situ observations of a set of 22 near - equatorial cmes .",
    "their parameters cover a wide range of initial and propagation speeds ( 260 to 2715 km  s@xmath0 ) , and a variety of principal cme directions with respect to the hi observer ( 40@xmath10  to 170@xmath10  in heliocentric longitude ) .",
    "this is the first study to do such an analysis of such a large and diverse set of events . here",

    "these data were provided by hi on _ stereo - a / b _ , which , for the cmes under study , were positioned well outside the sun - earth line , on heliocentric longitudes between 30@xmath10  and 120@xmath10  away from the earth .    1 .",
    "* event selection * : we have selected cme events with clear interplanetary cme signatures ( shock , sheath and ejecta ) in _ wind _ and _ stereo - b _ in situ observations near 1 au , and which we could easily track in the hi j - maps .",
    "this set of cmes covers a wide range of initial speeds , so it is suitable for statistical analysis , although there are actually many more cmes in the data during this time range .",
    "the events in our list occurred during the rise of solar cycle 24 , between 2008 - 2012 , and _ stereo _ progressed towards and beyond opposition during this time .",
    "therefore , our dataset contains mostly slow frontsided and fast backsided cmes .",
    "our results must be considered carefully with this in mind , and are likely to be different for different datasets .",
    "2 .   * tracking cmes and prediction lead times : * we tracked cmes as far as possible in the j ",
    "maps , resulting in an average track length of @xmath128@xmath10  elongation . depending on the cme speed",
    ", its direction and the model applied , this corresponds to different distances each cme has traveled away from the sun at the time of the last hi observation .",
    "this distance is on average @xmath129 au , thus we have tracked most cmes almost up to 1 au .",
    "the prediction lead times also depend on several of the aforementioned parameters , and are on average @xmath130  hours , about @xmath131  day .",
    "this is considerably longer than those provided by a solar wind monitor at l1 ( on the order of 1 hour , e.g.  the current _ ace _ mission ) , but definitely shorter than lead times using corongraphs only ( on the order of cme transit times of a few days , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the work presented here should rather be seen as an attempt to establish connections between cme - related phenomena detected in different data sets ( coronagraph , heliosphere , in situ ) , which is strongly desirable for benchmarking various empirical or numerical cme prediction models .",
    "cme directions * : the three different geometrical models used in this study do not provide consistent cme directions , with differences of up to 50@xmath10  in heliocentric longitude for fast cmes . for this reason , we derived the direction from multi - viewpoint applications of the croissant model to coronagraph images as a well constrained reference for the initial cme direction .",
    "the fpf direction was shown to be , on average , consistent to within a few degrees with the croissant direction .",
    "this means that _ if cmes propagate radially away from the sun above 15 solar radii , the fpf method is superior over the others in deriving the cme principal direction_. however , there is also considerable scatter , of the order of @xmath132@xmath10  heliocentric longitude around the average direction .",
    "the directions provided by the ssef and hmf models , which assume an extended cme front , differ by about @xmath133@xmath10  from the croissant direction .",
    "these methods show a bias in the direction to values further away from the hi observer , with larger differences for faster cmes , confirming theoretical predictions by @xcite .",
    "cme arrival time and speed predictions : * using geometrical modeling to predict cme speed and arrival time , with a lead time of roughly 1 day , results in average absolute differences from observed icme sheath speeds and arrival times of @xmath134  km  s@xmath0 and @xmath135h , respectively , averaged over all three methods . the arrival time difference given by the root - mean - square method is @xmath136h . conserving the sign of the differences , similar numbers for calculated minus observed speeds and arrival times are @xmath137  km  s@xmath0 and @xmath138h , respectively . _ in summary , predicted icme speeds at 1 au are , on average , overestimated , and consequently , predicted arrival times are too early compared with the in situ observations_. correlating the interplanetary cme speed in the direction of the in situ observatory with the in situ speeds , and , independently , with the differences in observed and predicted arrival times , we obtained new empirical relationships between these variables , based on linear fits .",

    "* comparison to stereoscopic modeling * : @xcite found similar results for cme arrival time and speed prediction using the results of methods applied to two heliospheric imager instruments , such as fitting the stereoscopic croissant model to _ stereo / cor2/hi1/hi2 _ and _ soho / lasco _ images , for heliocentric distances up to about 0.9 au .",

    "it is interesting to note that an equivalent assumption of constant speed between 0.07 to 0.85 au in our geometrical modeling methods yields a similar level of predictive performance .",
    "second , we summarize our results in terms of the physical evolution of cmes between the sun and 1 au . in general , we find that , using single - spacecraft hi observations , it is much more difficult to generalise the behavior of cmes in terms of such properties as propagation direction , speed variation and global shape evolution when compared to the use of stereoscopic hi measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* cme radial propagation : * a major unsolved question is whether cmes propagate radially away from the sun , or undergo any significant change of direction as they travel through the interplanetary ( ip ) medium .",
    "cmes are known to be deflected in the corona by coronal holes @xcite and possibly through cme - cme interaction in ip space @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed the cme direction for a few events to stay within about @xmath151@xmath10  ( heliocentric longitude ) from the corona to the ip medium .",
    "this can still be considered as consistent with a radial propagation . with our own dataset ,",
    "cme deflections are difficult to assess without further analysis . as discussed above",
    ", the hi methods can give very different answers for a single event - _ cme principal directions are not well defined using single - spacecraft hi methods .",
    "_ note also that we assume constant direction in ip space in contrast to the stereoscopic methods , so we can only assess deflections by comparing directions derived from coronagraph and hi measurements .",
    "however , there is considerable scatter between these initial and ip directions ( of the order of @xmath132@xmath10 , about twice the level derived from stereoscopic methods ) , pointing indeed to the possibility that some cmes may significantly change in direction between the corona and the ip medium . while the croissant model constrains the cme direction well close to the sun",
    ", there is no straightforward way to constrain the cme direction using single - spacecraft in situ data , and thus we leave further analysis for future work .",
    "+ our results on cme direction in ip space clearly point out that its calculation is always influenced by the strongly idealized shapes of the cme front which we assume in the first place .",
    "the geometrical definitions we use make it possible to describe cme front shapes analytically , and form very useful tools .",
    "however , our study casts some doubts on their use in defining a cme s central propagation direction in the interplanetary medium , because its calculation depends so strongly on the assumption of its frontal geometry .",
    "consequently , we propose that _ future work should quote ranges of heliocentric longitude that will be affected by a cme , rather than a central direction_. this would be especially helpful when describing distorted or asymmetric cme front shapes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* cme speed profiles * : cmes are well known to decelerate in the solar wind out to 1 au , mainly due to a force equivalent to aerodynamic drag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we can see this clearly in our data",
    ". we can compare stepwise a cme initial speed ( @xmath152 , or @xmath153 au ) to its average ip propagation speed ( from @xmath154 to @xmath129 au ) , and to the speed of the icme sheath region observed in situ near 1  au .",
    "fpf and ssef suggest that cmes decelerate from the corona to ip space , while hmf yields a constant speed .",
    "cmes are clearly slower when observed in situ near 1 au than in ip space , and the in situ sheath region speeds can be reasonably well predicted by multiplying the ip speeds with @xmath155 and adding @xmath156  km  s@xmath0 , which is independent of the model used .",
    "the speed of @xmath156  km  s@xmath0 is reminiscent of the slow solar wind , and this relationship is also consistent with early work by @xcite .",
    "however , we can not definitely say where most of the deceleration occurs , because of our assumption of constant ip speed .",
    "recent analyses with stereoscopic methods by @xcite showed that much of the deceleration of fast cmes occuring up to about 80 solar radii ( 0.37 au ) , but there is probably no general distance by which the deceleration ceases , as a case has been found where a cme almost does not decelerate out to 1 au @xcite .",
    "* evolution of the global cme shape * : we expected that there would be clear differences concerning the prediction performance of different geometrical models , giving us hints which one better describes the cme front shape in the plane perpendicular to the hi images .",
    "in particular , we expected the ssef model , as it is the most mature , with a well defined cme width , to perform best .",
    "but surprisingly , we did not find any significant difference in its performance for predicting cmes compared to the other models .",
    "we think that this is caused by their assumptions of constant speed and constant direction , and their high sensitivity to a violation of these assumptions @xcite . in summary ,",
    "_ the current state of the art of geometrical modeling of cmes with single - spacecraft instruments ( i.e.  fitting methods ) in comparison to single - spacecraft in situ data precludes inferences to be made regarding the large  scale geometry of cme fronts in planes perpendicular to the hi images , such as the ecliptic plane .",
    "_    we conclude that predicting cme speeds and arrival times with heliospheric images gives more accurate results than using projected initial speeds from coronagraph measurements .",
    "these improvements are on the order of 12 hours for the arrival times @xcite , and our results are consistent with those found with other space weather models in the _ stereo _ era ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "independent of the specific methods used , we can derive an average of the cme interplanetary propagation speed when we track a cme out to 1 au .",
    "this average speed includes to some extent the background solar wind , which is known to play a significant role in modulating cme propagation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same is true for interacting cmes , although it can be very difficult to differentiate and decipher different density tracks in hi when cmes are launched close together in time and space @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the information contained in heliospheric images does indeed improve space weather prediction .",
    "however , the compromise between prediction accuracy ( @xmath98 ) and prediction lead times ( @xmath157 ) needs to be better studied .",
    "future modeling should thus focus on modeling cme tracks in j - maps for elongations from the sun of @xmath158@xmath10 , which will result in longer prediction lead times than one day in the current study .",
    "it needs to be assessed how the predictions for speed and arrival time become less accurate as the prediction lead time is increased , and the best balance for space weather prediction purposes needs to be found .    another possibility for future work is to actually include deceleration into the geometrical fitting methods for single - spacecraft hi instruments .",
    "this is expected to further improve the accuracy of predicting cme arrival times and speeds through use of a more realistic approach than the current assumption of constant speed .",
    "such an approach , applied to the different model geometries , could provide clues to the cme global front shape , in particular when constrained by multi - point in situ measurements .",
    "another solution would be to send a mission equipped with a heliospheric imager in a polar orbit around the sun to look down onto the ecliptic plane @xcite . in this way ,",
    "information on the global shape of a cme in the ecliptic , as it approaches earth , would be revealed , and the cme propagation characteristics could be provided by the geometrical models as used in our paper . however , for effectively predicting geo - effectiveness it is also necessary to know the components of the interplanetary magnetic field , which can not be derived from white - light images , and require new ideas like the faraday - rotation technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the _ solar orbiter _",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and _ solar probe plus _ missions are currently under development and will approach the sun closer than ever before by the end of the decade . the results and methods presented in this paper may provide both the scientific background and tools for analyzing the data from these exciting future missions .",
