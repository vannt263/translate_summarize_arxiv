    "the period of low solar activity during most of 2009 has been reported on extensively , though relatively little attention thus far has been paid to the amount of soft x - ray emission which is an important guide to the state of the solar corona s magnetic complexity . for much of 2009 , the emission in the _ geostationary operational environmental satellites _",
    "( _ goes _ ) longer - wavelength channel ( range 18   ) was below its threshold ( @xmath3 w  m@xmath4 ) . here",
    "we report on results from a highly sensitive soft x - ray spectrophotometer sphinx ( solar photometer in x - rays ) , part of the tesis package which was flown on board the russian _ coronas - photon _ spacecraft .",
    "unlike _ goes _ , sphinx successfully recorded soft x - ray emission over this entire period .",
    "the sphinx energy range was 115  kev , comparable to that of the _ goes _ longer - wavelength channel .",
    "_ coronas - photon _ , which was part of the international _ living with a star _",
    "program , was launched on 2009 january  30 into a near - polar orbit , and operated till 2009 december when spacecraft power failures terminated the mission .",
    "sphinx measurements were made from 2009 february  20 to november  28 .",
    "results from sphinx , preliminary versions of which have already appeared @xcite , indicate that on a number of periods during 2009 the 18    emission was some 20 times less than the _ goes _ a1 level ( equal to a flux of @xmath5 w  m@xmath4 ) , far less than the lowest level in the previous ( 1998 ) solar minimum ( @xmath6  w  m@xmath4 ) .",
    "the spectral capabilities of sphinx allow the temperature and emission measure to be obtained for these periods , with isothermal assumption for the emission from the whole corona .",
    "from these values , a rough extrapolation to the 0.12.4  kev energy range is made so that estimates can be made of the solar x - ray luminosity in a band comparable to the _ student nitric oxide explorer _ ( _ snoe _ ) in 19981999 and to that measured by the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) instrument on the _ rosat _ spacecraft .",
    "these comparisons suggest that the sun was a very weak x - ray emitter in 2009 compared with the time of _ snoe _ and with nearby stars k and m stars surveyed by _ rosat_.",
    "the sphinx instrument @xcite was constructed at the space research centre , polish academy of sciences , in wrocaw , poland .",
    "three peltier - cooled pin diodes ( d1 , d2 , and d3 ) viewed the sun behind precisely measured apertures with areas 21.50 , 0.495 , and 0.0101  mm@xmath7 respectively .",
    "the detectors , manufactured by amptek ( bedford , ma ) , are silicon wafers 500  @xmath8 m thick with 12.5  @xmath8 m beryllium windows , and were sensitive to @xmath9  kev ( 0.810   ) x - rays .",
    "the instrument was intensity - calibrated to better than 5% accuracy using various characteristic x - ray lines viewed through a 35-m - long pipe at the x - ray astronomy calibration and testing ( xact ) facility ( palermo , italy ) and at the bessy ii ( berlin , germany ) synchrotron source .",
    "the d1 detector , which had a sensitivity approximately 100 times greater than the _ goes _ 18    channel , was designed to measure very low x - ray fluxes . for moderate levels of x - ray emission ,",
    "this detector was liable to pulse pile - up and saturation effects .",
    "detectors d2 and d3 were intended for measuring the flux at higher levels of x - ray emission , though throughout the mission detector d3 recorded only noise while measurements from d2 had a mostly poor signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a fourth detector , designed to measure x - ray fluorescence within the instrument excited by solar radiation , was not turned on during the mission owing to the very low level of solar flux .",
    "the detector energy ranges from pre - launch calibration measurements were 1.214.9  kev ( d1 ) and 1.014.9  kev ( d2 ) . measured values of spectral resolution ( fwhm ) were 464  ev ( d1 ) and 319  ev ( d2 ) .",
    "they are an improvement over those of the _ rhessi _ spectrometer detectors ( @xmath10  kev ) , and comparable to that of the x - ray spectrometer solid state detectors  600  ev at 5.9  kev  on both _ mercury surface , space environment , geochemistry and ranging _ ( _ messenger _ : @xcite ) and _ near earth asteroid rendezvous _",
    "( _ near _ : @xcite ) . at the resolution of sphinx ,",
    "some line features ( composed of unresolved groups of lines ) are recognizable , including the fe line feature at 6.7  kev during small flares that occasionally occurred in 2009 .",
    "sphinx spectra were registered both in 256 channels and in ancillary four - channel spectra ( so - called basic mode ) during the mission . in the basic mode ,",
    "total photon counts were recorded in the ranges 1.53.0  kev and 3.014.9  kev ( d1 ) and 1.03.0  kev and 3.014.9  kev ( d2 ) , allowing x - ray light curves to be plotted , while another channel recorded particle emission .",
    "the plane of the near - polar orbit ( inclination @xmath11 ) of _ coronas - photon _ was almost perpendicular to the sun s direction , allowing the instruments including sphinx to view the sun for at least 60  minutes of the 96-minute orbital period , with full - sun coverage for two - week periods in april and july .",
    "however , there were interruptions to the observations due to enhanced particle background for up to 4 passages per orbit through the auroral ovals and two or three passages through the south atlantic anomaly in a 24-hour period .",
    "solar measurements were possible for 51% of the time that sphinx was turned on , or 37.5% of the total time that _ coronas - photon _ operated .",
    "an extensive grid of model spectra calculated with the chianti atomic database and code @xcite with various element abundance sets and ionization fractions was calculated to assist in interpretation of sphinx spectra .",
    "comparison with observed spectra allows electron temperature ( @xmath12 ) and volume emission measure @xmath13 ( @xmath14 electron density , @xmath15 emitting volume ) to be deduced from the observed emission on an isothermal assumption .",
    "an anomaly occurred in the d1 detector on april  6 when enhanced count rates , unassociated with solar activity , were observed over a two - hour period . within about four hours after this , according to a pre - planned sequence , new command software was uploaded to the spacecraft , resulting in a nearly full recovery .",
    "the anomaly therefore had minimal effects and did not affect the data analysis discussed here .",
    "either the d1 or d2 detectors may be used to monitor the coronal x - ray activity in 2009 .",
    "since the saturation and pile - up effects with the d1 detector are apparent only for flares , this detector is the preferred one for tracking the general , non - flare x - ray emission .",
    "figure  [ d1_countrate_blue ] shows the d1 light curve ( in photon counts s@xmath16 ) over the period 2009 february 20 to november 28 , constructed from intervals free from obvious particle events .",
    "the passage of active regions is evident from the increase of the d1 count rate in periods of up to about 14 days , the length of time for a long - lasting active region to rotate across the sun s visible hemisphere .",
    "the largest peak occurred in early july , when noaa active region 11024 dominated the emission ; this period has already been discussed by @xcite and @xcite . apart from flare events , _ goes _ did not record any emission above its detection limit over this entire period .",
    "times of particularly low emission are indicated in figure  [ d1_countrate_blue ] .",
    "twenty - seven such intervals were identified , each of several hours duration , the time ranges of which are given in table  [ low_flux_intervals ] .",

    "figure  [ xrt_ti_poly_image ] ( left panel ) is the full - sun xrt image taken in its ti - poly filter at 15:47  ut .",
    "this filter has a nominal passband ( one - tenth power points ) equal to 5.416.6    ( 0.72.3  kev ) , similar to the range of detectable emission in sphinx ( figure  [ aver_sp ] ) .",

    "is covered by emission equal to between 3  dn  s@xmath16 and 10  dn  s@xmath16 which we identify with the general corona . in the tesis 171    coronal image ( right panel )",
    "taken shortly after ( 16:24  ut ) , the emission features including the bright points and coronal holes are similar to those in the xrt ti - poly image , though with the addition of polar plumes which are clearly present at the south pole .",
    "the emission in the tesis image is primarily from and lines emitted at @xmath10  mk , similar to the estimated temperature from the sphinx spectrum of figure  [ aver_sp ] .    the volume of the corona on the visible hemisphere , estimated from the proportion covering the visible hemisphere and x - ray intensity fall - off at the limb , is @xmath30  @xmath31 , which , combined with the sphinx emission measure @xmath32 for interval  27 in table  [ low_flux_intervals ] , gives the electron density @xmath33 averaged over the corona to be @xmath34  @xmath1 .",
    "this approximate calculation , though it neglects the likely presence of fine structure , is consistent with estimates from visible coronal measurements ( @xcite : @xmath35  @xmath1 ) , measurements from the _ coronas - f _ spirit spectroheliograph ( @xcite : @xmath36  @xmath1 ) , and coronal hole densities from the _ soho _ sumer instrument ( @xcite : @xmath37  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the solar x - ray luminosity in the sphinx detector  d1 energy range ( 1.214.9  kev ) may be simply obtained from x - ray fluxes , corrected for 1  au , by the area of a sphere with radius 1  au ( @xmath38  cm@xmath7 ) , assuming that the emission from the visible hemisphere typifies the entire sun .",
    "these are given in table  [ low_flux_intervals ] ; the values range from @xmath40 to @xmath41  erg  s@xmath16 .",
    "sphinx was the only instrument in operation monitoring solar radiation in the 115  kev or comparable range during the 2009 solar minimum , while there was no equivalent instrument during the solar minimum of 1996 .",
    "the soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) on _ yohkoh _ , operational from 1991 to 2001 , had a variety of transmission filters including a beryllium filter with an energy range near that of sphinx , but full - sun images were not often taken in this filter .",

    "this value is much larger than that obtained from sphinx detector  d1 owing to the extra emission in the 0.31.2  kev range that the sxt thin aluminum filter is sensitive to .",

    "those of the ( _ snoe _ ) spacecraft ( operational 19982003 : @xcite ) cover the range 0.12.4  kev , and so included much softer energies ( 0.11.2  kev ) than those available to sphinx detector d1 .",
    "this interval , similar to that of _ rosat _ pspc instrument used for the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass , @xcite ) , includes h - like and he - like c , n , and o resonance lines and strong lines of mg , si , and fe emitted at coronal temperatures as well as a few lines emitted at lower temperatures characteristic of the solar transition region .",
    "the chianti isothermal fit to the sphinx spectrum shown in figure  [ aver_sp ] can be used to give a crude estimate of the x - ray luminosity in the 0.12.4  kev energy range for comparison . with @xmath44  mk and @xmath45  @xmath1 and using chianti , the 0.12.4-kev x - ray luminosity , or @xmath46 ,",

    "however , extrapolation by @xcite to the minimum indicates log  @xmath46 might have been as low as 26.8 .",
    "the sphinx data thus indicates that the 2009 minimum was much deeper in soft x - ray emission .",
    "the survey of 144 k and m dwarf stars within 7  parsecs surveyed by _ rosat _",
    "pspc indicates that only 15% of the stars have comparable or lower luminosities .    a differential emission measure ( dem )",
    "analysis might improve this estimate by taking into account the softer x - ray emission , and is in principle possible from the discrimination available in the several broad - band filters of the _ hinode _ xrt instrument .",
    "however , the variety of dem solutions obtained from a sequence of xrt full - sun images near in time to the spectrum shown in figure  [ aver_sp ] resulted in x - ray spectra that were far too flat compared with that observed : thus , at energies of @xmath49  kev , there were several orders of magnitude more emission .",
    "it would appear that the limitations of dem analysis in the x - ray range under discussions are too severe for meaningful analysis .",
    "measurements with the sphinx spectrophotometer in the 115  kev energy range during the deep solar minimum of 2009 have shown the low level of soft x - ray emission in this period to a much improved extent than is available through _ goes _ which was below its threshold throughout the period apart from occasional flares .",
    "periods of exceptionally low activity have been identified , with spectra showing significant flux only in the 13  kev range and indicating that general coronal temperatures were between 1.7  mk and 1.9  mk , with emission measures between about @xmath50  @xmath1 and @xmath51  @xmath1 . combined with x - ray imaging data from the _ hinode _ xrt ,",
    "a lower limit for the coronal density is @xmath52  @xmath1 .",
    "the luminosities in the sphinx energy range study have been extrapolated to the _ snoe _ and _ rosat _ 0.12.4  kev range using an isothermal fit to the low - activity spectrum on september  16 .",
    "though very rough , these estimates indicate that on september  16 and at dates with similar x - ray activity levels the sun s x - ray luminosity from sphinx was much lower than in the 19961997 minimum and places the sun in the lowest - activity 15% of nearby k and m dwarf stars .",
    "this study should be of interest in view of the current predictions for the low level of the next solar minimum @xcite , and shows the need for instrumentation similar to sphinx if , as in the 2009 solar minimum , _ goes _ lacks the sensitivity to measure x - ray fluxes on a continuous basis .",
    "space - borne instruments such as the next - generation sphinx ( sphinx - ng ) on a forthcoming polish - us nanosatellite (  cubesat \" ) spacecraft and stix on _ solar orbiter _ should be in a position to estimate future solar x - ray levels in the event of forthcoming deep solar minima .",
