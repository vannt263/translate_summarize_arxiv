    "the idea of the ads / cft ( anti de - sitter / conformal field theory ) correspondence  @xcite ( or gravity - gauge duality ) is successfully used for solving problems in different areas of theoretical physics .",
    "originally formulated for a super yang - mills theory this duality connects fields in the bulk of the ads space with current correlators on the boundary of this space which then are corresponded to the ones in the field theory in flat space - time with less dimension  @xcite . in application",
    "to qcd the duality idea is valuable for solving low - energy problems , when usual perturbation theory does not work .",
    "though qcd is not conformal theory , there are some qcd models based on this duality , such as holographic qcd and ads / qcd models . in order to build a model of ads / qcd one should break the conformal symmetry .",
    "this can be done either by imposing boundary condition on a solution to equation of motion over extra dimension or by warping the metric of the ads space . in the first case",
    ", the boundary condition cuts a slice of the ads space and gives mass spectrum , which then is corresponded to the mass spectrum of observed particles .",
    "such a model is called a hard - wall model   @xcite and is successfully applied to calculation of physical quantities of mesons and baryons  @xcite . in the second case , which is called a soft - wall model ,",
    "there are no sharp boundaries and propagation of a particle at long distances of extra dimension is suppressed by introduction of a dilaton field  @xcite .",
    "the hard - wall model was extended in  @xcite by inclusion of spin-3/2 fields and the model was applied to calculations of the meson - baryon transition couplings and transition form factors for interactions of @xmath4 baryons with nucleons , @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons . here",
    "we include interactions of spin-3/2 fields with a photon field into the hard - wall model and consider @xmath7 interaction vertex within this model . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we briefly describe the hard - wall model with the spin-3/2 field introduced in  @xcite",
    ". in section  [ sec3 ] , we present some relevant formulas of the isotopic structure for @xmath4 baryons and expressions of multipole form factors of these particles .",
    "we construct in the bulk of the ads@xmath0 space an interaction lagrangian for the spin-3/2 field with a gauge field , which includes all possible interactions of the gauge field with the spin-3/2 field and produces on the boundary the matrix element of the electromagnetic current of the spin-3/2 field .",
    "this matrix element has the same tensorial structure as the one for the @xmath4-baryon s electromagnetic current obtained in  @xcite within the qcd framework . from the matching of tensorial structures in matrix element expressions obtained here and in  @xcite we obtain the vertex function coefficients in integrals over the additional dimension .",
    "these coefficients allow us to study electromagnetic form factors of @xmath8 baryons in the framework of the hard - wall model that we perform in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "let us express the main features of the hard - wall model of the ads / qcd described in  @xcite .",
    "gravity theory in this model is given by a 5-dimensional ( 5d ) anti de - sitter space ( ads@xmath0 ) and with the metric chosen in poincare coordinates as @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the fifth coordinate and it extends from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , which are called , correspondingly , the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the infrared ( ir ) boundaries of the ads space . @xmath13 is the metric of 4d flat minkovski space @xmath14 . in the hard - wall model",
    "@xmath10 is cut off at the bottom by @xmath15 @xmath16 and at the top by @xmath17 , ( @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 corresponds to the confinement scale of qcd . the latter cutoff breaks conformal symmetry at a slice of the ads@xmath0 space .",
    "hereafter , under the boundary we shall mean the cut off ir boundary .    in this background",
    "we introduce a gauge filed @xmath20 and a spin-3/2 field @xmath21 that interact with each other .",
    "the gauge field @xmath22 in the bulk theory corresponds to the current of spin-3/2 field @xmath23 on the boundary .",
    "the flavor symmetry group for the model is @xmath24 and the gauge symmetry group is @xmath25 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath26 has left @xmath27 and right @xmath28 components , transforming under flavor symmetry as representations of @xmath29 and @xmath30 groups respectively .",
    "let us write the bulk - to - boundary propagator for the gauge field , which is called profile function and the solution to equation of motion for the rarita - schwinger field in the background ( [ 1 ] ) .",

    "one of the bulk r - s fields gives left - handed component of the boundary field and the second one gives the right - handed component of this field . on the boundary extra components of bulk fields are eliminated by boundary conditions , that give a mass spectrum of excited states of this field . for",
    "a clearness let us present in brief some formulas from this ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "the action for the rarita - schwinger field @xmath21 in ads@xmath0 is the extension of the 4d - action into 5d and is given as @xmath46 here , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are antisymmetric products of @xmath49 matrices : @xmath50 @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath53 is defined by the following shift : @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 . for the metric ( [ 1 ] )",
    "the vielbein @xmath57 has chosen as @xmath58 and the spin connection @xmath59 has following non - zero components @xmath60 @xmath61 .",

    ".    the equation of motion obtained from the action ( [ 6 ] ) will give us 5d rarita - schwinger equations in the ads@xmath0 space ( [ 1 ] ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 are masses of spinor harmonics or the r - s field on @xmath67 of @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath69 matrices it is convenient to use chirality basis  @xcite , @xmath70    in the four - dimensional theory , the r - s field @xmath71 is a 4d vector -spinor and contains extra components , which correspond to the states of spin 1/2 particle .",
    "these extra components are projected out by application of the additional lorentz - covariant constraint @xmath72 in a five - dimensional theory , it is necessary to impose similar condition in order to project out extra components of the 5d r - s filed @xmath73 corresponding to the states of the spin-1/2 field @xmath74 this constraint , together with the free equation of motion , gives another constraint @xmath75 .",
    "the 5d rarita - schwinger filed @xmath76 has one more extra spin-1/2 component @xmath77 .",
    "it can be gauged away in the unitary gauge or it can be mapped to the longitudinal component of the massive spin-1 vector mesons in the boundary theory . in this model , there is no extra spinor states in the boundary theory into which the @xmath78 could be mapped . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the condition @xmath79 was chosen in order to eliminate this extra spin-1/2 degree of freedom and we shall follow it . taking into account these conditions in rarita - schwinger equation ( [ 7 ] )",
    "gives the next set of dirac equations for the remaining components @xmath80 it is useful to make further calculations in left and right components of vector - spinor which have properties @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "fourier transformation for these bulk vector - spinors is written as following @xmath83 and the 4d vector - spinor @xmath84 obeys 4d dirac equation @xmath85 here , @xmath86 for a time - like four - momentum @xmath87 .",
    "then the 5d dirac equation ( [ 11 ] ) will lead to equations for @xmath88 over the fifth coordinate @xmath10 : @xmath89 the normalizable solution to this equation for non - zero modes @xmath90 is expressed in terms of bessel functions of first kind @xmath91 where @xmath92 are normalization constants .",

    "the normalization constants @xmath92 were found in  @xcite and are equal to @xmath112",
    "the model which was described above is applicable to any spin-3/2 fields that differ from one another by some other quantum number .",
    "the simplest known realistic model for spin-3/2 particles is the model gased on the gauge group @xmath113 and the flavor group @xmath24 .",
    "these are states of the spin-3/2 field with isospin-3/2 , _ i.e. _ , the multiplet of @xmath4 baryons .",
    "there are four kinds of @xmath8 baryons ( @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) which differ from each other by the isospin projection . in order to get a difference in the current matrix element for different kinds of those baryons",
    ", we should take into account the known isotopic structure of the electromagnetic current of @xmath8 baryons . to this end",
    "we can utilize formulas for the isospin operator and wave functions for @xmath8 baryons used in  @xcite .",

    "our aim is to find within hard - wall model of ads / qcd the expressions corresponding to these coefficients .      in order to obtain an expression for the electromagnetic interaction vertex of the @xmath8 baryons within ads / qcd model , we should start from the interaction lagrangian of the rarita - schwinger field with the gauge field in the bulk theory .",
    "note that this lagrangian besides simple interaction term will contain different interaction terms which should lead to contributions of interactions with different multipole moments in the boundary theory .",
