    "perovskite materials are quite ubiquitous and exhibit a variety of interesting and intriguing phenomena such as superconductivity or charge ordering ( or their co - existence ) , colossal magnetoresistance , ferroelectricity , spin - dependent - transport , and the interplay among magnetic , structural , and transport properties @xcite .",
    "many oxides , that have the formula @xmath0 , assume a perovskite structure where two adjacent @xmath1 octahedra share an oxygen which leads to cooperative octahedral distortions .",
    "simple systems that manifest such cooperative electron - phonon phenomena are the barium bismuthates ( @xmath2 ) . here , only the 6s electrons are involved in transport and these electrons produce only a single normal mode distortion , namely , the breathing - mode . in pure @xmath2 ,",
    "the @xmath1 octahedra alternately dilate and contract with @xmath3 bonds of adjacent octahedra differing by about @xmath4 which is indicative of strong electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) @xcite .",
    "thus the relevant physics is dominated by a one - band three - dimensional cooperative breathing - mode ( cbm ) .",
    "there is also compelling evidence of strong epi in manganites ( from extended x - ray absorption fine structure@xcite and pulsed neutron diffraction@xcite measurements ) and in cuprates ( through angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite ) .    in copper oxides , as pointed out in refs .",
    ", the dynamics of the zhang - rice singlet @xcite can be described by a one - band system with orbitals centered on copper sites .",
    "furthermore , the onsite energy is modulated by the movement of oxygen closer or further from the neighboring copper ion .",
    "thus the breathing - mode is relevant to describe the linear modulation of the onsite energy .",
    "consequently the copper - oxide planes represent a one - band two - dimensional cbm system .    in the context of the two - band jahn - teller manganite systems as well , when c - type antiferromagnetism manifests [ as in @xmath5 for @xmath6 @xcite ] ,",
    "the @xmath7 orbitals participate in the c - chain ordering .",
    "a ferromagnetic c - chain can be looked upon as a one - band ( i.e. , @xmath7 orbital band ) and one - dimensional ( 1d ) cbm system that is however jahn - teller coupled to neighboring c - chains whose spin alignment is antiparallel .",
    "understanding the cbm phenomena , in systems such as the bismuthates , the cuprates , and the manganites is still an open question .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the cbm physics in the simpler case of a one - band 1d system by taking account of the _ quantum phonons _ [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : chain](b ) ] .",
    "in fact , a controlled analytic treatment of the many - polaron effects produced by quantum phonons in a one - band 1d holstein model [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : chain](a ) ] @xcite ( which is a simpler non - cooperative epi system ) has been reported not long ago@xcite .",
    "however , definite progress has been made in numerically treating the holstein model at half - filling ( by employing a variety of techniques ) @xcite and , to a limited extent , away from half - filling @xcite .",
    "owing to its cooperative nature , the epi leads to non - local distortion effects which can change the very nature of long range order . while a weak interaction is amenable to a migdal - type of perturbative treatment , the strong interaction ( even for a one - band system )",
    "necessitates a non - perturbative approach @xcite . as a step towards modeling cbm distortions in real systems ( such as the bismuthates , the cuprates , and the manganites ) , the present work builds up on our previous work on the holstein model @xcite to obtain the effective hamiltonian for a one - band 1d cbm system @xcite . upon inclusion of cooperative effects in the strong epi ,",
    "we show that the system changes its dominant transport mechanism from one of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping to that of next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping while the effective nn electron - electron interaction becomes significantly more repulsive due to incompatibility of nn breathing mode distortions .",
    "away from half - filling in rings with even number of sites ( while the holstein system without cooperative effects remains a luttinger liquid at all interaction strengths ) , our model ( at strong interaction ) , produces a commensurate charge - density - wave ( cdw ) state which is surprisingly conducting and whose period is independent of density .",
    "furthermore , using scaling of the fidelity susceptibility ( fs ) , we demonstrate that the cdw transition is a second - order quantum phase transition ( qpt ) .",
    "orbital hopping sites ( filled circles ) and oxygen sites ( empty circles ) in ( a ) holstein model , ( b ) one - band cbm system.,width=288 ]    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we derive an effective polaronic hamiltonian starting from a cbm model in sec .",
    "ii . next , we present the relevant formulae for the density - density correlation function and the structure factor in sec .",
    "we then analyze the strong - coupling limiting case of our cbm model in sec .",
    "the nature of the qpt and the long range order in our cbm model are discussed in sec .",
    "v. finally , we close in sec .",
    "vi with our conclusions .",
    "to bring out the essential physics , we begin with a 1d model of spinless electrons hopping in a one - band system of @xmath7 orbitals which are coupled to the oxygens in between , via cbm as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : chain](b ) @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath8 where the hopping term @xmath9 , using standard notation , is given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) being the destruction ( creation ) operator of an electron in a @xmath13 orbital ( at site @xmath14 ) .",
    "the epi term @xmath15 is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) , @xmath18 , @xmath19 represents the expansion of the oxygens around the @xmath20 orbital , and the right - hand - side ( rhs ) oxygen displacement @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , the lattice term @xmath22 representing simple harmonic oscillators is of the form @xmath23 the main difference between the holstein model and the above cooperative hamiltonian is that in the holstein model electrons at different sites are coupled to different on - site molecular distortions whereas in the present system the electrons on adjacent sites are coupled to the displacement of the same in - between oxygen .",
    "thus in our system , to produce an effective polaronic hamiltonian , we need to devise a modification of the usual lang - firsov transformation @xcite so as to take into account the cooperative nature of the distortions . to meet this end , we used the following canonical transformation @xmath24 where @xmath25 now contains the _ difference in densities on adjacent sites _",
