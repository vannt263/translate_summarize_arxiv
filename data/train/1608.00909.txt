    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the nodal / vortex structure of a typical chaotic eigenfunction in each model system : in 1a , a cube with periodic boundaries ; in 1b , the 3-sphere ; and in 1c , the 3dho . in all three cases",
    "the random modes are labelled by energy @xmath1 with principal quantum number @xmath2 ( further details of how the model systems are generated and how the vortices are located is given in supplementary notes 1 and 2 ) . in each of figures",
    "1d - g , a single vortex line from these eigenfunctions is shown alongside a simpler projection of the same knot .",
    "each vortex line resembles a random walk @xcite .",
    "our analysis of these knots uses the standard conventions of mathematical knot theory@xcite , in which knots in closed curves can be factorised into prime knots which are tabulated according to their minimum number of crossings ( examples are shown in supplementary figure 5 ) . both prime knots ( e.g.  as figure  1d , f - g ) , and composites of prime knots ( e.g.  as figure  1e ) , are identified in the curve data by a combination of several schemes . after simplifying the longest curves by a geometric relaxation method@xcite , several topological invariants are computed for each curve , which distinguish knots of different types .",
    "these are : the absolute value of the alexander polynomial@xcite @xmath3 , evaluated for @xmath4 at certain roots of unity ; the hyperbolic volume@xcite ; and the second and third order vassiliev invariants@xcite .",
    "although other knot invariants can have more discriminatory power than these separately  @xcite , they tend to be significantly more demanding in computer time : in practice the combination of this particular set of invariants discriminates almost all tabulated knots@xcite ( up to at least 14 crossings ; the methods are described further in supplementary note 3 ) .",
    "each of these invariants encodes different topological and geometric information about each knot@xcite .",
    "when comparing the knottedness of different vortex loops , we follow previous studies@xcite in using the ( positive integer - valued ) knot determinant @xmath5 as the primary quantitative measure of their knotting complexity .",
    "we have identified approximately knots from around @xmath6 curves ( of different lengths ) , computed from about @xmath7 random eigenfunctions ( at different energies ) .",
    "some of these knotted curves are relatively short ( such as that in figure  1d ) , although the majority of vortex knots are much longer , such as in figure  1e , whose full spatial extent spreads over several periodic cells . at large lengthscales ,",
    "each curve approximates a brownian random walk@xcite ; for closed curves , the radius of gyration scales with the square root of the total length .",
    "most of the vortex knots occur in closed loops ; in the 3dho , however , most vortex lines stretch to spatial infinity as almost - straight lines in the classically forbidden region .",
    "most of the knots in the 3dho are in these open curves , such as that represented in figure  1 g . in the periodic cube , many of the longer lines wrap around the cell a nonzero number of times ( i.e.  they have nontrivial homology , so in a tiling of the 3d cells they would be infinitely long and periodic@xcite ) . since knots in such a periodic space have not been adequately classified mathematically@xcite , we only consider knots in closed loops with trivial homology in this system",
    ".    links , which are configurations of two or more vortex curves that are topologically entangled with one another , also occur frequently .",
    "in fact we find links to be more common than knots , consistent with previous investigations of random optical fields at smaller lengthscales in which links are found to be common but knots were not detected@xcite .",
    "the restriction to knotting in the present study was chosen as it allows comparison with extensive studies of the knotting probability of random curves ( as random walks)@xcite , whereas the study of random linking is not so well developed .",
    "furthermore , linking of open curves ( in the 3dho ) is not well - defined . for these reasons ,",
    "our analysis is limited to the statistics of vortex knotting .       against @xmath8 for the thee systems at the same energies of the examples in figure 1 : * a * periodic cube , @xmath9 ; * b * 3-sphere , @xmath10 ; * c * three - dimensional harmonic oscillator , @xmath11 . in each system , the logarithm of the probability that a given vortex curve is unknotted as a function of its length @xmath12 is plotted in the insets , with error bars representing the standard error on the mean probability over many different random eigenfunctions . for larger values of @xmath12 , this unknotting probability logarithm is fitted to @xmath13 , with scaling factors @xmath14 of approximately : * a * @xmath15 ; * b * @xmath16 ; * c * @xmath17 . in the main plots ,",
    "the strong horizontal lines of constant , low - value @xmath5 correspond to specific knots , such as the trefoil ( for which @xmath18 ) and the composite double trefoil @xmath19 ( for which @xmath20 ) . ]",
    "is even ( odd ) , for reasons described in the main text , and errors represent the standard error on the mean fraction of knotted eigenfunctions , averaged over many different random samples .",
    "insets depict the vortices in a typical eigenfunction at different energies , with each vortex curve is represented in a different colour . ]        as one might expect , the random eigenfunction statistics show that longer knotted vortex curves display a greater complexity of knot types , as measured by the knot determinant @xmath5 .",
    "this is represented in figure  2 for each of the three systems at fixed energy .",
    "these histograms indicate that the distribution of @xmath21 with respect to vortex length @xmath12 apparently scales according to a power law .",
    "longer curves are also more likely to be knotted ; the probability of a given vortex loop being unknotted decreases exponentially according to @xmath12 ( figure  2 insets ) , as previously studied for random walks modelling polymers@xcite .",
    "the value of the unknotting exponents is different for each of the three systems , given in the caption .",
    "each of the model systems studied has a finite spatial extent : the side length of the cube , and the diameters of the 3-sphere and classically - allowed region of the 3dho . in the latter two cases ,",
    "this finite size imposes a long - length cutoff @xmath22 to the brownian scaling of long vortex lines . in the 3-sphere and 3dho , loops",
    "whose radius of gyration exceeds @xmath22 are confined , and the brownian and confined regimes have different knotting probability exponents .",
    "both knotting probability and complexity increase distinctly with length in the confined regime , where long curves are restricted to volumes much smaller than the corresponding brownian radius of gyration would allow .",
    "in contrast , the cube s periodic boundary conditions allow the vortex lines to have extent greater than the cube side length , although the brownian scaling of loop sizes gives way at some @xmath22 to the lines with nontrivial homology , which do not contribute to the knot count .",
    "figure  2b , c shows that the minimal complexity of knots in the confined regime also scales with @xmath12 ; long vortices are always knotted in these systems , and the knot is usually very complex .",
    "by contrast , under periodic boundary conditions ( figure  2a ) even the longest vortex loops can be topologically trivial . in all of these cases ,",
    "the scaling depends weakly on the energy of the eigenfunction , at least in the ranges of energy considered in the simulations .",
    "the total vortex length in random eigenfunctions is proportional to their energy @xmath1 ( see supplementary note 1 ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect knotted vortex lines to occur more frequently in higher - energy eigenfunctions .",
    "this probability of knotting with energy is shown in figure  3 for eigenfunctions of the 3-sphere and 3dho . in the 3-sphere , where all vortex loops must be closed , this probability reaches 99% when @xmath23 , which is surprisingly small to guarantee such a degree of topological complexity ( as illustrated in the insets ) .",
    "the energies simulated in the 3dho are insufficient to guarantee that a random eigenfunction will contain a knotted vortex ( figure  3a ) , as the distribution of vortex lengths in the classically allowed region prefers a greater number of shorter curves .",
    "the knotting probability of a 3dho eigenfunction also strongly depends on whether the principal quantum number @xmath2 is odd or even , since 3dho energy eigenstates , and hence the zeroes ( i.e.  the vortex tangle ) , must be parity - symmetric with respect to spatial inversion through the origin ; in fact , the nodal system of vortex curves is required to be strongly negatively amphicheiral@xcite ( i.e.  the tangents at parity - opposite vortex points must be parallel ) .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath2 is odd , exactly one open vortex line must pass through the origin , such as the low - energy example in figure  4a . since strongly negatively amphicheiral knots must be open ( see supplementary note 4 and supplementary figure 6 ) , this line can take such a configuration and is commonly knotted , contributing to a larger knotting probability when @xmath2 is odd ( other knots can occur when @xmath2 is odd or even , but only in antipodal pairs , as in figure  4b ) .",
    "this symmetry constraint applies to all energies considered in the simulations .",
    "eigenfunctions of the 3-sphere must also be symmetric under inversion between antipodal points , but here the curve system must be strongly positively amphicheiral ( opposite vortex points have antiparallel tangents ) .",
    "the simplest prime knot with this symmetry is in fact the 10-crossing knot @xmath24@xcite , and an example of a knotted vortex of this type is shown in figure  4c .",
    "based on computer experiments , we have shown that knotted vortex lines are common in random quantum wavefunctions , even at comparatively low energies .",
    "these results complement previous rigorous mathematical studies where small knots ( of any type ) have been proven to occur with nonzero probability in random eigenfunctions of the 3dho@xcite and hydrogen atom@xcite at high energies",
    ". these knots would be quite different from those studied in the present work , as they occupy limited volumes and , in the 3dho , occur with exponentially small probabilities .",
    "as such , those knots may be thought of as highly structured superoscillatory phenomena@xcite , known to be very rare . on the other hand ,",
    "the knotted vortices emphasised here can extend throughout the entire wavefunction , and are rather common except at the lowest energies ; in fact , the very smallest knots we find in the 3dho are an order of magnitude larger than the bounds on the size of superoscillatory examples",
    ". preliminary numerical studies of vortex knots in random eigenfunctions of hydrogen indicate similar behaviour to the 3dho described here , where eigenfunctions containing knotted vortices are typical beyond a certain energy ( and comparable mode count ) , although unlike the 3dho and 3-sphere , the nodal sets are not constrained by an amphicheiral symmetry .",
    "although our computer experiments have been limited to modes of fixed energy , we do not anticipate major differences in systems of random waves with different power spectra , such as a turbulent bose - einstein condensate@xcite with characteristic power law spectrum , especially when sizes of system are similar to or greater than those considered here .",
    "knotting of vortices in chaotic complex 3d eigenfunctions is a complex counterpart to chladni s original observation of the structure of cavity modes , and we anticipate that generic 3d complex cavity modes@xcite will contain knotted vortices .",
    "our results lead us to expect that almost every random quantum eigenfunction at sufficiently high energy contains at least one knotted vortex line and , at least in the systems considered here , this is common even at the relatively low energies currently accessible to numerical experiment",
    ". knotted nodal lines with characteristic complexity scalings may therefore be a complex , 3-dimensional counterpart to the nodal statistics proposed to signify quantum chaos@xcite for real - valued chaotic eigenfunctions in two dimensions . based on the mode counts@xcite of the energies in figure  3",
    ", we expect knotted vortices to occur with 50% probability from somewhere between the 500th ( 3-sphere ) to th ( 3dho ) mode of a chaotic cavity",
    ".      * sampling random eigenfunctions . *",
    "we generate random eigenfunctions of model systems via standard random superpositions of their degenerate eigenfunctions .",
    "further details and comparisons of these systems , especially their eigenfunctions , are included in supplementary note 2 .    *",
    "tracking vortices ( nodal lines ) .",
    "* within each random eigenfunction , phase vortices are numerically tracked by sampling the wavefunction on a cubic lattice ( initial voxel size approximately @xmath25 ) and checking around each numerical grid plaquette for the circulation of phase indicating the passage of a vortex line through the face of the grid cell .",
    "the phase is only guaranteed to circulate in this way when the amplitude is zero but the complex scalar gradient is non - zero ( i.e.  the vortices occur as transverse intersections of real and imaginary nodal surfaces ) , but this is generically the case in random eigenfunctions ; the algorithm would otherwise fail to converge on the vortex line but , as anticipated , we have never observed this to happen .",
    "this core procedure does not always fully capture the geometry of the vortex curve ( especially where two vortex lines approach closely ) , and so the above procedure is augmented with a recursive resampling of the numerical grid , at successively higher resolutions , in any location where the vortex line tracking is ambiguous ; we call this the rrcg algorithm ( see supplementary note 2 ) .",
    "since vortex lines must be continuous , the result of the algorithm is a piecewise - linear representation of each vortex in the entire large scale tangle .",
    "the vortex topology is retained , and geometry well recovered , even with a relatively poor initial sampling resolution .",
    "the algorithm generalises to each of periodic boundary conditions , the 3-sphere and the 3dho via an appropriate choice of lattice boundary conditions , and in the case of the 3-sphere by sampling on multiple cartesian lattices and joining appropriate boundaries to reproduce the geometry of the sphere .    * detecting and classifying knots and links . *",
    "the topology of vortices is investigated using the standard knot invariants described in the main text , whose values depend only on the topology of a single curve and from which the knot type can be inferred .",
    "it is computationally expensive to use some invariants known to be more powerful ( e.g.  the jones or homfly - pt polynomials ) , or to identify the exact knot type of every curve .",
    "when necessary ( figure 1 , figure 4 ) we are able to do so unambiguously using the alexander polynomial ( evaluated at certain roots of unity ) , hyperbolic volume , and vassiliev invariants or degree 2 and 3 .",
    "we further use the knot determinant to measure the topological complexity of vortex curves even without identifying their specific knot types .",

    "the ensemble of random functions is statistically isotropic , homogeneous and ergodic , and the ( non - normalizable ) basis states @xmath36 can be taken to be plane waves with the same spatial frequency @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "unlike the rwm , our numerical realisations are systems involving superpositions over a finite number of degenerate energy eigenfunctions ( indexed by principal quantum number @xmath2 ) , whose spatial complexity only occupies a finite spatial volume yet whose spatial configuration ( including the vortex lines ) is statistically similar to the rwm .",

    "vortices can be located in this 2d problem either via their intensity ( which must be zero ) or the circulation of their phase ( which must be @xmath88 in a path around the edge of a penetrated plaquette ) .",
    "it is standard to make use of this latter property , as zeros of the intensity are difficult to pinpoint numerically whereas the integrated total change of the phase can be detected even with relatively few sample points situated far from the vortex core ; in fact , it is possible to detect most vortex penetrations with just the four sample points at the corners of grid plaquettes with side length around @xmath25 .",
    "a vortex line is additionally _ oriented _ by the right - handed sense of its quantised phase circulation , and according to this orientation must both enter and leave any grid cell that it passes through ( it can not simply terminate ) . the above procedure",
    "therefore normally detects the passage of a vortex through two different faces of each 3d grid cell .",
    "the vortex curve is recovered by joining these points and connecting each line segment with those in neighbouring cells to build up a piecewise - linear approximation to the three - dimensional vortex tangle .",
    "this basic procedure does not perfectly detect vortex curves ; vortex penetration of a 2d plaquette may not be detected if the local phase change is too anisotropic on the scale of the lattice spacing .",
    "this occurs especially when the lattice spacing is large , or if vortices approach closely , since in this case the @xmath88 integrated phase about multiple vortices can not be distinguished from the zero phase change which would mean a vortex is not present .",
    "such problems give apparently discontinuous vortex lines , and the numerical procedure _",
    "resamples _ the complex wavefield in the cells around these apparent discontinuities , generating a new local grid with higher resolution and repeating the search for vortices using this new lattice .",
    "if a vortex is discontinuous on the new grid , the resampling procedure is repeated recursively , and is guaranteed to terminate eventually since at very small lengthscales the smoothness of the field limits large phase fluctuations . by matching the different numerical lattices with one another and joining vortices where they pass between them , the recovered vortex curves are continuous within the full numerically sampled region , forming locally - closed loops or terminating on its boundaries .",
    "a primary advantage of this method is that it correctly resolves the local topology of vortex lines without requiring a prohibitively high resolution sampling over the entire field .",
    "this issue has alternatively been addressed in previous studies using physical arguments  @xcite , an extra random choice  @xcite or a different grid shape  @xcite , but none of these options is so numerically convenient while guaranteeing robust results .",
    "the resampling procedure can also be used to enhance the recovery of local vortex geometry , as described in  @xcite , but this is not important to the topological results described here .",
    "the rrcg algorithm must further be modified in each of the three different systems of wave chaos we consider . with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the finite numerical grid is itself made periodic along each cartesian axis of the periodic cell , but the rrcg procedure is otherwise unaffected .",
    "vortex loops are recovered by ` unwrapping ' vortex segments through the periodic boundaries , equivalent to tiling space with periodic cells and following each loop continuously until its starting point , so the net vortex loop can ( and often does ) pass through several periodic cell .    in the harmonic oscillator",
    ", vortices may extend to infinity and we only consider vortex length within a finite radius of the origin .",
    "as distance from the origin increases beyond the classical radius , vortex curves tend to radial lines without further tangling ( clearly visible in supplementary figure  [ fig : qho_classical_region ] , or figure 1 of the main text ) , and we take the cutoff at twice the classical radius @xmath89 .    tracking vortices in the 3-sphere is more complicated since it must be projected to flat real space to make it accessible to our 3d cartesian grid based numerical method .",
    "standard methods such as stereographic projection are numerically inefficient because they greatly distort distances and therefore vortex densities , such that an initial numerical resolution sufficient to detect vortices in the densest regions will be far higher than necessary in other areas where the vortex densities are lower .",
    "we instead divide the 3-sphere into a net of eight cubes , with each taken to be a cartesian grid covering one of the eight octants of the 3-sphere .",
    "the rrcg algorithm is run on each octant grid , with overall topology recovered by identification of faces in the overall net .",
    "this process is illustrated in supplementary figure [ fig : sphere_projections ] , where [ fig : sphere_projections]a shows vortices in each of the cubic octants of the net , discontinuous where they meet the octant faces , while [ fig : sphere_projections]b - c show the same vortices in two continuous projections to @xmath90 ; these are respectively stereographic projection and the projection used in the main text . although the spatial round metric of the 3-sphere does vary over each octant , the length variation is in fact relatively small ( by no more than a factor of @xmath91 ) and does not significantly impede vortex tracking efficiency .",
    "the analysis of topology in wave chaos requires that the topological _ knot type _ of each vortex curve can be distinguished . it is standard to accomplish this through the calculation of _ knot invariants _ , which are mathematical objects ( integers , polynomials , ... ) that can be computed from the geometric conformation but are the same for all representations of the same topological knot ( i.e.  under ambient isotopy )",
    ". mathematical knot theory provides many such invariants , which have been used to develop a taxonomy summarised in _ knot tables _ , although no invariant is known to distinguish all knots .",
    "the values of invariants associated with the _ unknot _ ( i.e.  a loop which is not knotted ) are usually trivial , whereas the invariants of proper knots usually take other values .",
    "knot tables are usually ordered by the invariant _ minimal crossing number _ ,",
    "i.e.  according to the smallest number of _ crossings _ the knot admits on projection into a 2-dimensional plane ; the first few prime knots are written @xmath92 ( the only knot with minimal crossing number 3 , i.e.  the trefoil knot ) , @xmath93 ( the only knot with minimal crossing number 4 , i.e.  the figure-8 knot ) , then @xmath94 , and so on .",
    "supplementary figure [ fig : knot_table ] shows the 35 non - trivial prime knots with 8 or fewer minimal crossings . _ composite knots _ , those which can be separated into distinct prime knot components each with smaller minimal crossing number such as figure 1e in the main text , are not included in this table .",
    "composite knots are referred to as combinations of prime knots joined by @xmath95 , or by exponents for a repeated component ; for instance , @xmath96 for the double trefoil knot or @xmath97 for the join of the first two non - trivial knots .",
    "invariants of composite knots can usually be factorised in some sense into those of the component knots , and they are denoted by adjoining the notation of their prime components . whether a given vortex curve is knotted is found by calculating one or more knot invariants , and then looking these up in the knot table .",
    "the values of invariants can also give information about different families and classes of which a given knot is a member  @xcite .    our primary requirement is to distinguish lines that are knotted from those that are not , and to be able to sort knotted curves by some simple knot invariant which measures their complexity . for this",
    "we employ the _ alexander polynomial _",
    "@xcite @xmath98 , which is straightforward to calculate up to an unknown factor of @xmath99  @xcite ( e.g.  the unknot has alexander polynomial @xmath100 , the trefoil knot @xmath92 has @xmath101 ) as the determinant of a matrix with dimension @xmath102 for projection of the knot with @xmath103 crossings .",
    "some knotted curves have alexander polynomial @xmath100 , like the unknot , but such knots are comparatively rare ; the simplest examples are two knots with minimal crossing number 11 , already complex enough to be highly uncommon in eigenfunction vortex tangle .",
    "supplementary figure [ fig : knot_table ] demonstrates this trend ; each knot is coloured by the frequency of its occurrence across all eigenfunction data in all different systems , with most knots by frequency having low minimal crossing numbers , and those with @xmath104 crossings already being up to times less common .",
    "since the projections of curves in our numerical tangle may have several thousand crossings ( even after algorithmic simplification ) , it can be impractical to calculate the full alexander polynomial symbolically .",
    "thus we evaluate the alexander polynomial at specific values , conveniently the first three nontrivial roots of unity , @xmath105 ( giving the _ knot determinant _",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the absolute value @xmath3 is invariant under this substitution regardless of the unknown factor of @xmath4 , and this combination of integer values discriminates the tabulated knots almost as well as the symbolic alexander polynomial itself ; for instance , they are equally discriminatory when distinguishing the 802 prime knots with 11 or fewer crossings .",
    "the determinant is a commonly used tool for identifying knots in numerical studies  @xcite , although we have not found @xmath108 at other roots of unity used elsewhere in numerical knot identification .",
    "the knot determinant is also convenient on its own as a measure of knot complexity ; it takes its minimum value on the unknot , @xmath109 , and tends to increase with crossing number ( we find it appears on average linearly related to the exponential of the minimal crossing number , consistent with known bounds  @xcite ) , and for a composite knot is the product of determinants of its prime components  @xcite .",
    "many other invariants fulfil these conditions , but the determinant is convenient due to its ease of calculation , the same reason that it is used already in knot detection .",
    "supplementary figure [ fig : knot_table ] includes this complexity trend for each of the non - trivial knots with 8 or fewer minimal crossings , taking values from @xmath110 ( for the simple trefoil knot @xmath92 ) to @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 ) .    where it is necessary to distinguish the knot type beyond the discriminatory ability of the alexander polynomial , such as in figure 1 of the main text , further invariants are used .",
    "modern knot theory supplies many powerful options , but most of these are impractical to calculate rapidly for large numbers of geometrically complex projections ( being calculable only in exponential time ) , and we instead use more efficient options that are nevertheless sufficient .",
    "first , the _ vassiliev invariants _ of order two and three are also integer invariants of knots , practically calculable in square or cubic time respectively in the number of crossings of a given diagram , but adding further discriminatory power beyond that of the alexander polynomial  @xcite .",
    "these invariants have been used previously in numerical knot identification  @xcite .",
    "we also use the _ hyperbolic volume _ , which takes values in the real numbers and is nonzero only for the so - called _ hyperbolic knots _ , but is highly discriminatory among this class , and for this reason has seen major use in knot tabulation  @xcite .",
    "most tabulated prime knots are hyperbolic ( of the the 1.7 million prime knots with 16 or fewer crossings , only 32 are not  @xcite ) , but composite knots always have volume zero and so are also readily separated from prime knots in this way .",
    "the hyperbolic volume is calculated using the standard topological manifold routines in snappy  @xcite , which return only an approximation but are reliable over the range of complexities we address .",
    "neither these vassiliev invariants nor the hyperbolic volume are perfect knot invariants , but combined with the alexander polynomial they are sufficiently discriminatory to unambiguously identify most simple knots where necessary , such as those in figures 1 and 4 of the main text .",
    "they also further verify that in practice the alexander polynomial rarely fails to detect knotting among the vortex lines of our eigenfunction systems , as those prime knots with @xmath108 indistinguishable from the unknot are generally easily detected to be hyperbolic .",
    "some aspects of knotting in eigenfunctions are dominated by the _ symmetry _ of the system .",
    "such symmetries have already been removed in our analysis of wave chaos under periodic boundary conditions , but remain in the eigenfunctions of both the 3-sphere and 3dho .    in the 3-sphere ,",
    "all eigenfunctions satisfy the condition @xmath113 and , since , vortices are nodal lines , a vortex at a given position is always paired with a vortex at its 3-sphere antipode .",
    "if these points are on different vortex lines then both lines are identical up to a rotation of the 3-sphere by @xmath0 through some plane in four dimensions , and so they have the same knot type . if two antipodal points are positions on the same vortex line then the entire vortex curve must be symmetric ( carried to itself ) under this rotation .",
    "not all knot types can meet this geometric constraint ; those that can do so are a subclass of knots that are _ strongly amphicheiral_.    strong amphicheirality is an extension of the more commonly considered chirality of knots ; a knot is chiral if it is not equivalent to its mirror image ( i.e.  with the overstrand and understrand at each crossing switched ) , and otherwise is called amphicheiral ( or equivalently achiral ) . both types are common , e.g.  the trefoil knot is chiral ( shown in supplementary figure [ fig : symmetric_knots]a ) , but the next non - trivial knot , @xmath93 , is amphicheiral  @xcite ( evident in the projection of supplementary figure [ fig : symmetric_knots]c , equal to its mirror image under a rotatation by @xmath0 about the marked point , discussed further below ) .",
    "strong amphicheirality additionally demands that the knot be equivalent to its mirror not just in its knot type , but under a specific involution of the 3-sphere , i.e.  a geometric transformation that is its own inverse  @xcite .",
    "supplementary figure [ fig : symmetric_knots]b - d shows three example diagrams of strongly amphicheiral knots in which the involution is rotation in two dimensions by @xmath0 about the marked point , which in each case takes the knot diagram to its mirror image ; b gives an example of how any composite of a knot with its mirror image admits a strongly amphicheiral conformation  @xcite , c shows strong amphicheirality of the knot @xmath93 , and d the same for the more complicated @xmath24 .",
    "strongly amphicheiral knots are additionally split into two classes depending on how the involution affects the orientation of the curve , which for an arbitrary curve may not matter but in vortex lines is fixed by the orientation of the phase .",
    "a knot is _ strongly negatively amphicheiral _ if this orientation is preserved under the involution , or _",
    "strongly positively amphicheiral _ if its orientation is reversed .",
    "supplementary figure [ fig : symmetric_knots]b and [ fig : symmetric_knots]c show strongly negatively amphicheiral examples ( note the reversal of the marked orientation under rotation about the marked point ) , and this is additionally the reason for these diagrams being drawn as open curves closing at infinity ; under the involution of rotation , the origin of rotation is privileged such that the curve must pass through this point and close at infinity ( equivalent to the antipode considered on the 3-sphere ) .",
    "no other conformation would be able to meet the strong negative amphicheiral symmetry .",
    "in contrast , supplementary figure [ fig : symmetric_knots]d shows a strong positive amphicheiral conformation of the knot @xmath24 . in fact , @xmath24 is the simplest knot with strong positive amphicheiral symmetry , and ( with a different conformation ) also supports strong negative amphicheirality .    in eigenfunctions of the 3-sphere , the symmetry under rotation reverses the local vortex line orientation according to its phase circulation .",
    "this means that such vortices passing through antipodal points can only form strong positive amphicheiral knots , of which the simplest example is the unknot but the first non - trivial prime example is @xmath24 .",
    "although not discussed in the main text , this knot and others with the same symmetry occur with disproportionate frequency in 3-sphere eigenfunctions , with simpler knots occurring only as symmetric antipodal pairs ( under the eigenfunction symmetry ) or as strong positive amphicheiral composite knots .",
    "this symmetry also has an equivalent effect at all @xmath2 , and so does not lead to significant patterns in knotting probability with energy , as can be seen in figure 3a of the main text .",
    "eigenfunctions of the 3dho have a similar symmetry under inversion through the origin , @xmath114 , but with the difference now that this supports only strong negative amphicheiral symmetry ; the vortex tangent direction is preserved under the inversion . as with the 3-sphere ,",
    "any vortex line passing through @xmath115 is paired with one at @xmath116 , and if these points are on different vortices then the entire vortex line appears twice .",
    "if the points are on the same vortex line then it must take up a strongly negatively amphicheiral conformation . under inversion ,",
    "the only way to do so while meeting the symmetry of the eigenfunction is to pass through the origin and to close at infinity , taking a conformation such as those in supplementary figure [ fig : symmetric_knots]b and [ fig : symmetric_knots]c . unlike in the 3-sphere , only one vortex line in a given eigenfunction can do so , and at most one strongly amphicheiral knot can appear . since the 3dho naturally supports vortex lines which eventually extend to infinity in straight lines outside the classical radius , it is possible for the privileged origin vortex line to do so and to be knotted .",
    "the probability of a vortex passing through the origin depends directly on @xmath2 ; when @xmath2 is even , random degenerate eigenfunctions are non - zero at the origin , whereas when @xmath2 is odd the origin is always a nodal point and sits on a vortex line .",
    "this is the reason for the observed odd - even discrepancy in knotting probability with energy in figure 3 of the main text ; when @xmath2 is even there is no strongly negatively amphicheral vortex line and all knots occur in pairs of antipodal mirrors .",
    "when @xmath2 is odd , such a vortex line always exists and can form a strongly negatively amphicheiral conformation of a knot .",
    "this is relatively common , as the total arclength required to form such a knot is often lower than for the two symmetric copies otherwise required .",
    "this knot is frequently prime ( unlike with strong positive amphicheirality , there are several strongly negatively amphicheiral knots with fewer than 10 crossings ) , but can also be a composite of a knot with its mirror image .",
    "compatible knots are thus overrepresented in the statistics of knot type within the system , but now only when @xmath2 is odd explaining the strong parity dependence of knotting in the 3dho .",
    "the effect is also strong enough to persist even at @xmath2 high enough that there is a 50% or higher chance for one or more pairs of the other vortex lines in a given eigenfunction to form knots ."
