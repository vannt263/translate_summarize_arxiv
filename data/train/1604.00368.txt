    "@xcite if for all @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath6 , the probability that the first @xmath17 digits of a real number are @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 while benford variables have logarithmic distributions in all of their digits , often times , in benford literature the focus has only been on the distribution of the first digit .",
    "such a limitation may obscure the true nature of the quantity investigated .",
    "there are data sets which exhibit a perfect `` benford '' distribution in the first digit , but fail to do so in the second .",
    "nigrini @xcite provided such an example , and consequently recommended the use of the first two digit test in order to improve the recognition of the benford datasets , and thus to identify financial fraud .",
    "he also recommended this approach for other accounting related analysis .",
    "such cases were generalized in @xcite , where a new class of random variables , called _",
    "@xmath0-digit benford variables _ , was introduced .",
    "these variables exhibit a logarithmic digit distribution only in their first @xmath0 digits , but are not guaranteed to be logarithmically distributed beyond the @xmath0-th digit . unlike benford variables whose decimal logarithm is uniformly distributed , the decimal logarithm of n - digit benford random variables has less stringent constraints ; it must only satisfy prescribed areas over a given partition of the unit interval .",
    "this provides us with a collection of random variables that contains the benford variables as a subset .",
    "it is intuitive to assume that when @xmath0 goes to infinity , a @xmath0-digit benford variable converges to benford .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to prove that this is indeed the case .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in the next section we introduce the @xmath0-digit benford variables together with some of their properties . in section [ sed : si ] we briefly discuss sum invariance , which is fundamental for our main result . finally , using sum invariance , in section [ sec - main ] we show that an @xmath0-digit benford variable converges to benford , as @xmath20 .",

    "however , @xmath13 is not a @xmath33-digit benford variable , since for example @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 as required by ( [ eq : nben ] ) .",
    "to define sum invariance , we first define the significand function , also known as the mantissa function .    the significand function @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the floor of @xmath39 .",
    "let us consider a finite collection of positive real numbers @xmath40 , and define @xmath41 to be the sum of the significands of the numbers starting with the sequence of digits @xmath42 .",
    "sum invariance means that @xmath41 is digit independent .",
    "for instance , consider the fibonacci sequence which is known to be benford @xcite .",

    "nigrini was the first to notice sum invariance in some large collections of data @xcite .",
    "@xcite refined this concept , by defining it in connection with continuous random variables .",
    "specifically , a distribution is sum invariant if the expected value of the significands of all entries starting with a fixed @xmath0-tuple of leading significant digits is the same as for any other @xmath0-tuple : @xmath46=     { \\mathbb e}\\left [ s_{d_1'\\cdots d_n ' } y\\right]$ ] .",
