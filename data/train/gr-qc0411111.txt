    "there are two fundamental physical parameters namely the gravitational coupling @xmath0 and the cosmological term @xmath1 , in the einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "usually these parameters are assumed to be constants .",
    "but recent experimental and ( or ) observational evidences suggest that it is not unlikely to have small variations [ 1 ] of these fundamental parameters .",
    "however , alternative ideas about the variability of these parameters have been started long ago .",
    "the idea of variable @xmath0 was first introduced by dirac [ 2 ] in cosmological consideration and then subsequently by sciama [ 3 ] , jordan [ 4 ] and others .",
    "later , brans and dicke [ 5 ] proposed an extension ( or modification ) of einstein s theory of gravity by introducing a scalar field @xmath5 . in this theory ,",
    "the newton s gravitational constant @xmath0 is a variable and is related to the scalar field @xmath6 .",
    "+ the cosmological term @xmath1 on the otherhand , was originally suggested by einstein himself to obtain static solution of his field equations .",
    "but after his realization that the universe is expanding , he discarded the cosmological term .",
    "afterwards , the cosmological term has been introduced and subsequently rejected several times for various reasons . but recent measurements of the cmb anisotropy and the observations from type ia supernovae demand a significant and positive cosmological constant [ 6 , 7 ] .",
    "also observations of gravitational lensing indicate the presence of a non - zero @xmath1 .",
    "however , to resolve the cosmological constant problem ( i.e. , its observed value is about 120 orders of magnitude below the value for the vacuum energy density predicted by quantum field theory ) a phenomenological solution namely a dynamical @xmath7 has been suggested by several authors [ 8 ] , arguing that @xmath1 relaxes its present estimate due to the expansion of the universe . also due to these recent observational predictions the vacuum energy density @xmath8 has played an important role and the cosmological constant problem has been shifted to the _ coincidence problem _ namely why @xmath9 and @xmath10 happen to be of the same order of magnitude precisely at this very moment . to resolve this naturalness several quintessence models [ 9 ] have been proposed where the cosmological constant becomes a time dependent quantity .",
    "recently bonanno et al [ 10 ] ( see also shapiro et al [ 11 ] ) have formulated a general frame work for cosmologies in which both newton s constant and the cosmological constant are time dependent and have shown that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are approximately equal in the late universe .",
    "they have assumed that there exists an infrared attractive fixed point for the renormalization group flow of the ( dimensionless ) newton s constant and cosmological constant respectively .",
    "vishwakarma [ 12 ] has proposed a variable @xmath1 proportional to @xmath11 ( @xmath12 hubble parameter ) and has showed a good agreement with recent supernovae observations .",
    "also this choice provides expected large age of the universe .",
    "+ in this paper , we analyse a 5d brane world model with a time dependent brane tension @xmath13 and constant 5d cosmological constant @xmath4 .",
    "we shall show that this will lead to a 4d effective theory with time dependent @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "although the fundamental theory is not yet known , the time dependent of the self - energy of the brane @xmath13 can be the result of some higher dimensional effect , such as a particular bulk - brane interaction , or the response of the brane to the change in the inter - brane distance in a 2-brane world model .",
    "thus here we attempt to make a  phenomenological \" study of the implications of such a time - dependence of @xmath13 on observable 4-dimensional parameters , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and its consistency with current observational constraints .",
    "the idea of brane world scenario was proposed by randall and sandrum [ 13 ] .",
    "they have shown that in a five dimensional space - time ( called _ bulk _ ) it is possible to confine the matter fields in a four dimensional hypersurface ( called _ 3-brane _ ) .",
    "the effective action in the bulk is [ 14 ]    @xmath14    here any quantity in the bulk is marked with subscript ` 5 ' with @xmath15 as the 5d gravitational coupling constant .",
    "the co - ordinates on the bulk are denoted by @xmath16 while those on the brane as @xmath17  .",
    "so @xmath18 the four dimensional hypersurface , is defined as the brane world .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 stands for the brane tension which is assumed to be positive to recover the conventional gravity on the brane .",
    "the other parameter @xmath4 is the negative vacuum energy and is the only source of gravitational field on the bulk while @xmath19 are the intrinsic curvature on either side of the brane ( characterized by @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) .",
    "now the effective einstein equations on the bulk are [ 15 , 16 ]    @xmath22    where @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) is the total energy - momentum tensor ( vacuum+matter ) on the brane i.e. ,    @xmath25=\\delta ( \\chi)\\delta^{\\mu}_{a}\\delta^{\\nu}_{b}\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}~~.\\ ] ]    here @xmath26 is usual matter energy tensor and the dirac delta function indicates the fact that matter is confined in the space - like hypersurface @xmath27 ( the 3-brane ) with induced metric @xmath28 .",

    "+ the above einstein equation has two correction terms to the energy - momentum tensor namely the local correction term @xmath36 with expression    @xmath37    while the other correction term is the non - local effects from the free gravitational field in the bulk with expression    @xmath38    here @xmath39 is the usual weyl tensor in the bulk ,",
    "@xmath40 the unit normal to the hypersurface @xmath27 and the four dimensional cosmological constant @xmath1 has the expression @xmath41 with @xmath42    as the four dimensional gravitational constant . now using the conservation of the total matter energy - momentum tensor on the brane namely @xmath43 into the modified einstein equations on the brane we have a constraint on @xmath44 and @xmath45 as @xmath46 maartens has shown that @xmath45 can be decomposed as [ 16 , 17 ] @xmath47\\ ] ] where the prefactor @xmath48 ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) is introduced for dimensional reasons ( note that @xmath50 gives the general relativistic limit ) and the energy flux @xmath51 and energy stresses @xmath52 has the following properties : + ( i ) @xmath51 is a spatial vector ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) + ( ii)@xmath54 is a spatial ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) , symmetric @xmath56 and trace - free ( @xmath57 ) tensor .",
    "+ the scalar term @xmath58 is called dark energy density as it has the same form as the energy momentum tensor of a radiation perfect fluid .",
    "also @xmath59 is the 4-velocity on the brane with @xmath60 , the projection tensor orthogonal to @xmath59 on the brane .",
    "further , using the constraint equation ( 11 ) between @xmath61 and @xmath44 , it is possible to have evolution equations for @xmath58 and @xmath51 but not for @xmath52 .",
    "so the system of equations on the brane is not , in general closed .",
    "+ as we are considering bianchi models which have a simple transitive three dimensional group of isometries @xmath62 on the space - like hypersurfaces , so the cosmological models are spatially homogeneous with proper time as the only dynamical variables .",
    "thus the metric on the brane can be written as [ 18 ] @xmath63    further , the physical parameters which are of observational interest in cosmology are the following : + expansion scalar :  @xmath64 + shear scalar : @xmath65 + deceleration parameter :  @xmath66 + where the mean anisotropy parameter @xmath67 has the expression @xmath68    and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the directional hubble parameters and mean hubble parameters respectively .",
    "+ lastly , for bianchi i and v model we get @xmath71 but @xmath72 remains unrestricted . as there is no way of fixing the dynamics of this tensor , we shall study the particular case @xmath73 .",
    "then from the constraint equation ( 11 ) the dark energy density @xmath58 is a function of the proper time alone i.e. , @xmath74 and the evolution equation for @xmath58 takes the form @xmath75 which on integration gives @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the volume scale factor and @xmath78 is an integration constant .",
    "the line element of a bianchi i space - times generalizes flat frlw metric to the anisotropic case as    @xmath79    we have taken perfect fluid as the matter on the brane with expression @xmath80    where the energy density @xmath9 and thermodynamic pressure @xmath81 satisfy the isothermal equation of state namely @xmath82    the combinations of the non - vanishing components of the einstein field equations on the brane ( i.e.(5 ) ) are [ 18 ] @xmath83 and @xmath84    it is to be noted that so far we have not considered any variation of the 4d physical parameters namely @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 shows a time variation of brane tension @xmath13 ( see equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) ) , keeping 5d quantities as invariant . from observational point of view",
    "it is generally assumed that the time variation of @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath70 as [ 19 , 20 ] @xmath85    where the dimensionless parameter @xmath86 has present observational bound @xmath87 .and @xmath88 is constant of integration . + as from equation ( 9 ) @xmath89 so the differential equation in @xmath13 has the same form namely , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is integration constant .",
