    "while the experiments at rhic @xcite advanced the empirical knowledge of the hot qcd matter dramatically , the understanding of the state of matter that has been formed is still lacking .",
    "for example , the star collaboration s assessment @xcite of the evidence from rhic experiments depicts a very intricate , difficult - to - understand picture of the hot qcd matter . among the issues pointed out as important was the need to clarify the role of quark - antiquark ( @xmath5 ) bound states continuing existence above the critical temperature @xmath6 , as well as the role of the chiral phase transition .",
    "both of these issues are consistently treated within the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) approach to quark - hadron physics .",
    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dchsb ) as the crucial low - energy qcd phenomenon is well - understood in the rainbow - ladder approximation ( rla ) , a symmetry preserving truncation of the hierarchy of ds equations .",
    "thanks to this , the qcd low energy theorems are fulfilled and the behavior of the chiral condensate and pion mass and decay constant are in accord with the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation , i.e. the goldstone theorem .    for recent reviews of the ds approach , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , of which the first @xcite also reviews the studies of qcd ds equations at finite temperature , started in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the extension of ds calculations to non - vanishing temperatures is technically quite difficult .",
    "this usage of separable model interactions greatly simplifies ds calculations at finite temperatures , while yielding equivalent results on a given level of truncation @xcite .",
    "a recent update of this covariant separable approach with application to the scalar @xmath7 meson at finite temperature can be found in @xcite . here , we present results for the quark mass spectrum at zero and finite temperature , extending previous work by including the strange flavor .",
    "the dressed quark propagator @xmath8 is the solution of its ds equation @xcite , @xmath9 while the @xmath10 meson bethe - salpeter ( bs ) bound - state vertex @xmath11 is the solution of the bs equation ( bse ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an effective gluon propagator modeling the nonperturbative qcd effects , @xmath14 is the current quark mass , the index @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) stands for the quark flavor ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is the total momentum , and @xmath20 .",

    "the extension of the separable model studies to the finite temperature case , @xmath36 , is systematically accomplished by a transcription of the euclidean quark 4-momentum via @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the discrete matsubara frequencies . in the matsubara formalism , the number of coupled equations represented by ( [ sde ] ) and ( [ bse ] ) scales up with the number of fermion matsubara modes included . for studies near and above the transition ,",
    "mev , using only 10 such modes appears adequate .",
    "nevertheless , the appropriate number can be more than @xmath41 if the continuity with results is to be verified .",

    "if there are no poles in the quark propagator @xmath8 for real timelike @xmath55 then there is no physical quark mass shell .",
    "this entails that quarks can not propagate freely , and the description of hadronic processes will not be hindered by unphysical quark production thresholds .",
    "this sufficient condition is a viable possibility for realizing quark confinement  @xcite .",
    "a nontrivial solution for @xmath32 in the chiral limit ( @xmath56 ) signals dchsb .",
    "there is a connection between quark confinement realized as the lack of a quark mass shell and the existence of a strong quark mass function in the infrared through dchsb .",
    "the propagator is confining if for real @xmath55 , where the quark mass function is . in the present separable model , the strength , which is generated by solving eqs .",
    "( [ gap1 ] ) and ( [ gap2 ] ) , controls both confinement and dchsb . at finite temperature ,",
    "the strength @xmath57 for the quark mass function will decrease with @xmath0 , until the denominator ( [ sdenominator ] ) of the quark propagator can vanish for some timelike momentum , and the quark can come on the free mass shell .",
    "the connection between deconfinement and disappearance of dchsb is thus clear in the ds approach .",
    "also the present model is therefore expected to have a deconfinement transition at or a little before the chiral restoration transition associated with .",
    "the following simple choice of the separable interaction form factors , @xmath58 f_1(p^2)=  , @xmath59 is used to obtain numerical solutions which reproduce very well the phenomenology of the light pseudoscalar mesons and generate an acceptable value for the chiral condensate .",
    "the resulting quark propagator is found to be confining and the infrared strength and shape of quark amplitudes @xmath31 and @xmath32 are in quantitative agreement with the typical ds studies .",
    "gaussian - type form factors are used as a minimal way to preserve these properties while realizing that the ultraviolet suppression is much stronger than the asymptotic fall off ( with logarithmic corrections ) known from perturbative qcd and numerical studies on the lattice @xcite .",
    "parameters of the model are completely fixed by meson phenomenology calculated from the model as discussed in @xcite . in the nonstrange sector , we work in the isosymmetric limit and adopt bare quark masses @xmath60 mev and in strange sector we adopt @xmath61 mev . then the parameter values @xmath62 @xmath63 lead , through the gap equation , to @xmath64 , @xmath65 mev , @xmath66 and @xmath67 mev i.e. , to the dynamically generated momentum - dependent mass functions @xmath68 shown in fig .",

    "obtaining such dynamically generated constituent quark masses , as previous experience with the ds approach shows ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "such as @xcite ) , is essential for reproducing the static and other low - energy properties of hadrons , including decays .",
