    "the possibility of a perfect lens @xcite whose resolution is not limited by the classical diffraction limit has been subject to intense debate by the scientific community during the past two years .",
    "this perfect lens could be realised by using a slab of material with @xmath4 where @xmath3 is the dielectric constant and the @xmath2 is the magnetic permeability .",
    "veselago had observed@xcite that such a material would have a negative refractive index of @xmath5 ( the negative sign of the square root needs to be chosen by requirements of causality ) , and a slab of such a material would act as a lens in that it would refocus incident rays from a point source on one side into a point on the other side of the slab ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . due to the unavailability of materials with simultaneously negative @xmath3 and @xmath2",
    ", negative refractive index remained an academic curiosity until recently when it became possible to fabricate structured meta - materials that have negative @xmath6 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "most of the negative refractive materials(nrm ) , so far , consist of interleaving arrays of thin metallic wires ( that provide negative @xmath3 @xcite ) and metallic split - ring resonators ( that provide negative @xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "although some initial concerns were expressed @xcite that the observed effects in these experiments were dominated by absorption , the recent experiments of refs.@xcite have confirmed that negative refractive materials are today s reality .     and",
    "@xmath7 is refocussed into a point on the other side .",
    "the rays representing propagating waves are bent on to the other side of the normal at the interfaces due to the negative refractive index of the slab .",
    ", width=302 ]    it was demonstrated by one of us that the nrm slab acts a lens not only for the propagating waves ( for which the ray analysis of veselago is valid ) but also for the evanescent near - field radiation @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon of perfect lensing becomes possible due to the surface plasmon states @xcite that reside on the surfaces of the nrm slab which restore the amplitudes of the decaying evanescent waves @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been confirmed by numerical ( fdtd ) simulations that an incident pulse is temporarily trapped at the interfaces for a considerable time @xcite . for a detailed description of the perfect slab lens ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "the ` perfectness ' of the perfect lens is limited only by the extent to which the constituent nrm are perfect with the specified material parameters .",
    "absorption in the nrm and deviations of the material parameters from the resonant surface plasmon conditions of the perfect lens causes significant degradation of the subwavelength resolution possible @xcite .",
    "we have suggested some possible measures to ameliorate this degradation of the lens resolution by stratifying the lens medium @xcite and introducing optical gain into the system @xcite .",
    "the image formed by the nrm slab lens is identical to the object and hence there is no magnification in the image .",
    "lenses are mostly used to produce magnified or demagnified images and the lack of any magnification is a great restriction on the slab lens on which most of the attention in the literature has been focussed .",
    "the slab lens is invariant in the transverse directions and conserves the parallel component of the wave - vector . to cause magnification",
    "this tranverse invariance will have to be broken and curved surfaces necessarily have to be involved .",
    "the perfect lens effect is dependent on the near - degeneracy of the surface plasmon resonances to amplify the near - field , and curved surfaces in general have completely different surface plasmon spectrum @xcite .",
    "it was recently pointed out by us that a family of near - field lenses ( in the quasi - static approximation ) in two - dimensions can be generated by a conformal mapping of the slab lens @xcite .",
    "thus a cylinderical annulus with dielectric constant @xmath8 was shown to have a lens - like property of projecting in and out images of charge distributions .",
    "similiarly in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , it was shown how a general method of co - ordinate transformations could be used to map the perfect slab lens solution for the maxwell s equations into a variety of situations including the cylinderical and spherical geometries respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we elaborate on the perfect lens solutions in the spherical geometry and show that media with spatially dispersive dielectric constant @xmath9 and magnetic permeability @xmath10 can be used to fabricate a spherical perfect lens that can magnify the near - field images as well . in section-2 of this paper",
    ", we will present these perfect lens solutions of the maxwell s equations for the spherical geometry . in section-3",
    ", we will examine the solutions in the extreme near - field limit or the quasi - static limit which is useful when the lengthscales in the problem are all much smaller than a wavelength .",
    "then the requirements for tm and te polarizations depend only on @xmath11 or @xmath12 respectively .",
    "this is useful at frequencies where we are able to generate structures with only one of @xmath3 or @xmath2 negative .",
    "we will investigate the effects of dissipation in the nrm and point out the connections to the 1-d slab lens solutions .",
    "we will present our concluding remarks in section-4 .",
    "consider a spherically symmetric system shown in fig .",
    "2 consisting of a spherical shell of nrm with the dielectric constant @xmath13 and @xmath14 imbedded in a positive refractive material with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "first of all we will find the general solutions to the field equations with spatially inhomogeneous material parameters : @xmath17     and @xmath18 images a source located inside the shell into the external region .",
    "the media outside have postive refractive index , but @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the amplification inside the spherical shell of the otherwise decaying field is schematically shown.,width=302 ]    under these circumstances of spherical symmetry , it is sufficient to specify the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 which will constitute a full solution to the problem .",
    "let us now look at the tm polarised modes @xmath23 , implying that only the electric fields have a radial component @xmath24 .",
    "operating on eqn .",
    "( 1 ) by @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 , \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2 } \\mu(\\mathbf{r } ) \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r } ) \\mathbf{e } + i \\omega \\frac{\\nabla \\mu(\\mathbf{r})}{\\mu(\\mathbf{r } ) } \\times \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{e}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eqns.(2 ) and ( 3 ) we have @xmath27 =   \\nabla\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r } ) \\cdot \\mathbf{e } + \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r})~ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{e } = 0,\\ ] ] and if we assume @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 we note the following identities for later use : @xmath31 @xmath32 and using eqn . (",
    "6 ) we also note that @xmath33 we now take a dot product of @xmath34 with eqn . ( 4 ) , and use the eqns .",
    "( 6),(7 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) to get an equation for @xmath35 as : @xmath36   + \\frac{\\varepsilon'(r)}{r \\varepsilon(r ) } ( re_r ) + \\varepsilon(r )",
    "\\mu(r ) \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2 } ( re_r ) = 0 .\\ ] ] this equation is separable and the spherical harmonics are a solution to the angular part . hence the solution is @xmath37 where the radial part @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 + \\frac{\\varepsilon'(r)}{r \\varepsilon(r ) } u + \\varepsilon(r ) \\mu(r ) \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2 } u = 0.\\ ] ] if we choose @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we can have a solution @xmath42 and we get @xmath43 r^{n-2 } +   \\alpha\\beta\\omega^2/c^2 r^{p+q+n } = 0,\\ ] ] implying @xmath44 and @xmath45.\\ ] ] hence the general solution can be written as @xmath46 y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi),\\ ] ] and @xmath47 \\mathbf{x}_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi),\\ ] ] where the vector spherical harmonic @xmath48 a similiar solution can be obtained for the te modes with @xmath49 .",
    "let us note a couple of points about the above perfect lens solutions in the spherical geometry .",
    "first , for @xmath64 , i.e. points outside the image surface the fields appear as if the source were located on the spherical image surface ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "however , this is not true for points @xmath66 within the image surface .",
    "second , given that @xmath67 , we have the perfect lens solutions if and only if @xmath68 which implies that @xmath54 in eqn . ( 13 ) .",
    "although the solutions given by eqn .",
    "( 14 ) occur in any medium with @xmath69 , the perfect lens solutions only occurs for @xmath70 . here",
    "we have written down the solutions for the tm modes .",
    "the solutions for the te modes can be similiarly obtained .",
    "as it has been pointed out in the previous section , the ` power ' solutions are good for any @xmath71 and @xmath72 such that @xmath73 .",
    "however the perfect lens solutions for the maxwell s equations result only for the single case of @xmath74 . in the quasi - static limit of @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    ", we can relax this condition .",
    "in particular , by setting @xmath77 and @xmath78 constant , we can have a perfect lens for the tm modes alone .",
    "similiarly , we can have a perfect lens for the te polarization by having @xmath12 and @xmath79 constant .",
    "this extreme near - field limit is both important and valid for situations when all lengthscales in the problem are much smaller than a wavelength of the radiation .",
    "this becomes useful at frequencies where we can only generate media with either negative @xmath3 and positive @xmath2 , or , negative @xmath2 and positive @xmath3 .",
    "examples are the silver slab lens at optical frequencies @xcite , the imeta - materials ( swiss rolls ) used for mri at radio - frequencies@xcite . particularly at radio- and microwave frequencies",
    ", we currently can practically engineer the required meta - materials with spatially dispersive characteristics at the corresponding length scales .",
    "further it also lifts the restriction that the system has to have a spatially dispersive material parameters even outside the spherical shell of nrm . in this section",
    "we will work in this extreme near field limit .",
    "then it is sufficient to solve the laplace equation and we present lens - like solutions to the laplace equation below .",
    "consider the spherical shell in fig.2 to be filled with a material with @xmath80 with the inner and outer regions filled with constant dielectrics of @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "let @xmath83 everywhere .",
    "now place a charge @xmath84 at the centre of the concentric spheres and a charge @xmath85 at a distance @xmath86 from the centre inside region-1 .",
    "we will consider the z - axis to be along the dipole axis and make use of the azimuthal symmetry here , although it is clear that our results do not depend on any such assumption of azimuthal symmetry .",
    "thus all our charge and their images will now lie along the z - axis .",
    "now we will calculate the potentials in the three regions that satisfies the laplace equation and the continuity conditions at the interfaces .",
    "the potential in region-1(@xmath87 ) can be calculated to be ( using the azimuthal symmetry ) : @xmath88\\ ] ] note that the second term in the above expansion arises due to the dipole within the sphere .",
    "it can be shown ( see appendix-1 ) , that the general form of the potential in region-2 ( @xmath89 ) , where the dielectric constant varies as @xmath90 is @xmath91.\\ ] ] in region-3(@xmath92 ) , the potential is given by : @xmath93.\\ ] ] now we must match the potentials at the interfaces at @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( put @xmath96 ) to determine the @xmath97 and @xmath98 coefficients .",
    "the conditions of continuity of the potential and the normal component of @xmath99 at the interfaces are @xmath100 we determine the coefficients from these conditions to be : @xmath101[\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2(a_1 ) ]   - [ \\epsilon_2(a_2)+\\epsilon_3 ] [ ( l+1)\\epsilon_1-l\\epsilon_2(a_1 ) ] \\frac{a_2^{2l+1}}{a_1^{2l+1}}\\ } } { l(l+1)[\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2(a_1)][\\epsilon_2(a_2)+\\epsilon_3 ] a_2^{2l+1}+   [ l\\epsilon_1 - ( l+1 ) \\epsilon_2(a_1)][l \\epsilon_2(a_2 ) - ( l+1)\\epsilon_3 ]   a_1^{2l+1}},\\\\   a_{2l } & = & \\frac{(2l+1)[l \\epsilon_2(a_2 ) - ( l+1)\\epsilon_3]a_0^l a_1^{-1 } }   { l(l+1)[\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2(a_1)][\\epsilon_2(a_2)+\\epsilon_3 ] a_2^{2l+1}+ [ l\\epsilon_1 - ( l+1 ) \\epsilon_2(a_1)][l \\epsilon_2(a_2 ) - ( l+1)\\epsilon_3 ]   a_1^{2l+1 } } ,   \\\\ b_{2l } & = & \\frac{(2l+1)(l+1 ) [ \\epsilon_2(a_2 ) + \\epsilon_3 ] a_2^l a_0^l   a_1^{-(l+2 ) } }   { l(l+1)[\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2(a_1)][\\epsilon_2(a_2)+\\epsilon_3 ] a_2^{2l+1}+   [ l\\epsilon_1 - ( l+1 ) \\epsilon_2(a_1)][l \\epsilon_2(a_2 ) - ( l+1)\\epsilon_3 ]   a_1^{2l+1 } } , \\\\   b_{3l } & = & \\frac{(2l+1)^2 \\epsilon_3\\epsilon_2(a_2 ) a_0^l a_2^{2(l+1 ) } a_1^{-1 } }   { l(l+1)[\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2(a_1)][\\epsilon_2(a_2)+\\epsilon_3 ] a_2^{2l+1}+   [ l\\epsilon_1 - ( l+1 ) \\epsilon_2(a_1)][l \\epsilon_2(a_2 ) - ( l+1)\\epsilon_3 ]   a_1^{2l+1}}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the perfect lens conditions @xmath102 we have : @xmath103 hence the potential outside the spherical shell for @xmath92 is @xmath104 which is the potential of a dipole with the positive charge at the origin and the negative charge at @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and of strength @xmath107 as @xmath108 .",
    "thus , on one side of the image ( the region @xmath109 ) the fields of a point charge located at @xmath105 are reproduced .",
    "however it should be pointed out that there is no physical charge in the image location and , the fields on the other side of the image ( i.e. in the region @xmath110 ) do not converge to the fields of the object and can not do so in the absence of a charge in the image . further there is no change in the strength of the charge either .",
    "there is a magnification in the image formed by a factor of @xmath111 .",
    "let us point out the similiarities to the planar slab lens . in both cases ,",
    "the electromagnetic field grows in amplitude across the negative medium when the perfect lens conditions are satisfied at the interfaces : as an exponential(@xmath123 $ ] ) in the planar lens and as a power of the radial distance @xmath124 in the spherical lens .",
    "the decaying solution away from the source is absent in the negative medium in both cases .",
    "further , when the perfect lens conditions are matched at both the interfaces , there is no reflected wave in both the planar slab as well as the spherical lens : i.e. the impedance matching is perfect as well .",
    "in addition this mapping preserves the strength of the charge .",
    "the key differences , however , are the different dielectric constants on either sides of the spherical shell of the negative medium .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the spatial @xmath90 dependence of the negative dielectric constant which relates the two positive dielectric constants to be @xmath125 . but",
    "this need not be a particular restriction as we can use the ideas of the asymmetric lens to terminate the different positive media at some radii beyond@xcite .",
    "the net result is that the image can now be magnified ( or demagnified ) when the image of the charge ( source ) is projected out of ( or into ) the spherical shell , which is true in the 2d cylinderical lens as well @xcite .      in the case of a planar slab , it was possible to have the perfect lens effect by satisfying the required conditions at any one interface - not necessarily at both interfaces@xcite .",
    "particularly , in the limit of very large parallel wave vectors the lensing is indeed perfect , although the image intensity differed from the source by a constant factor .",
    "similiarly let us now investigate the effects of having the perfect lens conditions in the case of the spherical lens at only one of the interfaces .",
    "let us consider first , the case of projecting out the image of a point source from inside the spherical shell to outside and enable the perfect lens conditions only at the outer interface @xmath126 and have an arbitrary @xmath127 .",
    "now the @xmath97 and @xmath98 coefficients come out to be @xmath128 } { l\\varepsilon_1 - ( l+1)\\varepsilon_2(a_1 ) } \\\\ a_{2l } & = & \\frac{(2l+1 ) a_0^l}{l\\varepsilon_1 -   ( l+1)\\varepsilon_2(a_1 ) a_1^{2l+2 } } \\\\ b_{2l } & = & 0 \\\\ b_{3l } & = & \\frac{(2l+1 ) \\varepsilon_3",
    "a_0^{l}}{l \\varepsilon_1(a_1/a_2)^2 + ( l+1)\\varepsilon_3 } \\left ( \\frac{a_2}{a_1 } \\right)^{2l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] only the growing solution within the negative spherical shell remains . the coefficient of the decaying solution ( @xmath129 ) remains strictly zero .",
    "thus , amplification of the decaying field at least is possible in this case as well .",
    "but there is a finite reflectivity in this case .",
    "however , the solution outside for @xmath92 is not the exact image field of the point source as the coefficient @xmath130 has an extra dependence on @xmath131 through the dependence on the dielectric constants .",
    "moreover , the process does not preserve the strength of the charge due to the different dielectric constants involved .",
    "this should be compared to the solution of the planar asymmetric slab lens where , at least in the electrostastic limit , the system behaved as a perfect lens .",
    "in this case , the system behaves as a spherical asymmetric perfect lens only in the limit of large @xmath132 .",
    "the solution outside the spherical shell is the same when we meet the perfect lens condition on the inner interface  just as in the case of the planar slab lens .",
    "however , the reflection coefficient is again non - zero , but different to the earlier case . in either case ,",
    "the fields are largest at the interface where one meets the perfect lens conditions or the interface on which the surface plasmons are excited .      media with negative real part of the dielectric constant",
    "are absorptive ( as all metals are ) , and hence we can write the dielectric constant @xmath133 ( note that @xmath134 as well for us to be able to write the solution in the following form ) . consider the first case of projecting out the image of a dipole located within the spherical shell where the potential outside the shell is given by equation ( 27 ) and @xmath130 is given by equation ( 33 ) .",
    "when we have a dissipative negative medium and have the perfect lens conditions at the interfaces on the real parts of the dielectric constant alone , @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in parallel with the case of the planar lens",
    ", we note that the denominator of @xmath130 consists of two terms , one containing a power of the ( smaller ) radius @xmath137 and the other containing a power of the ( larger ) radius @xmath138 .",
    "crucially the amplification of the evanescent fields depends on the possibility that the smaller power dominates by making the coefficient of the larger term as close as possible to zero .",
    "the presence of the imaginary part of the dielectric constant would not allow the coefficient to be zero and the image restoration is good only as long as the term containing @xmath137 dominates in the denominator of @xmath130 , i.e. , @xmath139[-(2l+1)\\varepsilon_3+i\\varepsilon_i(a_2)]a_1^{2l+1}\\ ] ] hence a useful estimate of the extent of image resolution can be obtained by noting the multipole @xmath131 for which the two terms in the denominator are approximately equal@xcite .",
    "we obtain for this value : @xmath140 \\right\\}}{2 \\ln \\left ( a_2/a_1 \\right ) } .\\ ] ] higher order multipoles are essentially unresolved in the image . we can similiarly obtain the same criterion by considering the second case of tranferring the image of a charge located outside the spherical shell into the inner region .",
    "again , we can consider the effects of deviating from the perfect lens conditions on the real part of the dielectric constant as well and obtain a similiar limit for the image resolution due to those deviations .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a spherical perfect lens which enables magnification of the near - field images .",
    "the perfect lens solution requires media with @xmath0 and @xmath141 and the conditions @xmath142 and @xmath143 at the interfaces of the spherical shell of the nrm .",
    "we have shown that in the quasi - static limit of small frequencies ( @xmath144 ) and high - order multipoles @xmath145 , this condition can be relaxed and the two polarizations ( te and tm modes ) decouple .",
    "thus a shell with negative dielectric constant @xmath146 with @xmath147 can act as a near - field lens for the tm polarization while @xmath148 with @xmath149 acts as a near - field lens for the te modes .",
    "we have shown that dissipation in the lens material , however , prevents good resolution of higher order multipoles .",
    "thus while the near - field lenses work best for the higher order multipoles , dissipation cuts - off the higher order multipoles .",
    "further the spherical lens works in the asymmetric mode only in the limit of high order multipoles .",
    "thus one has to find an intermediate regime where dissipation does not wipe out the near - field image information and yet the meta - materials work .",
    "this is the design challenge involving these near - field lenses .",
    "we have to solve the maxwell s equations in material media @xmath150 using @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the electrostatic potential we have : @xmath153 if @xmath154 has only a radial dependence ( as in our case @xmath155 ) , then @xmath156 and we can separate the solution as @xmath157 where the @xmath158 is the spherical harmonic and the radial part @xmath38 satisfies : @xmath159 = 0\\ ] ] to have a solution as a single power of @xmath160 , the only choices possible for the dielectric constant are either @xmath161 , a constant  the usual case , or @xmath162 . in the latter case",
    "the solution is @xmath163 or @xmath164 .",
    "the full solution can then be written as @xmath165 y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi).\\ ] ]    99 j.b .",

    "<S> it has been recently proved that a slab of negative refractive index material acts as a perfect lens in that it makes accessible the sub - wavelength image information contained in the evanescent modes of a source . here </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate on perfect lens solutions to spherical shells of negative refractive material where magnification of the near - field images becomes possible . </S>",
    "<S> the negative refractive materials then need to be spatially dispersive with @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on lens - like solutions for the extreme near - field limit . </S>",
    "<S> then the conditions for the tm and te polarized modes become independent of @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . </S>"
