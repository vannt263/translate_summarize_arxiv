    "low frequency @xmath0 noise @xcite is found in a wide variety of conducting systems such as metals , semiconductors , tunnel junctions @xcite , and even superconducting squids @xcite .",
    "yet the microscopic mechanisms are still not well understood .",
    "one example is an electron glass which is an insulator where electrons are localized by a strong random potential .",
    "a special case of this is a coulomb glass in which the electrons interact with one another via a long range coulomb potential .",
    "doped semiconductors and strongly disordered metals provide examples of electron glasses .",
    "experimental studies on doped silicon inversion layers have shown that low frequency @xmath0 noise is produced by hopping conduction @xcite . because the systems are glassy , electron hopping can occur on very long time scales which can produce low frequency noise . in this paper",
    "we show that the resulting noise spectrum goes as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is frequency and the temperature dependent exponent @xmath7 .",
    "shklovskii has suggested that @xmath0 noise is caused by fluctuations in the number of electrons in an infinite percolating cluster @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are caused by the slow exchange of electrons between the infinite conducting cluster and small isolated donor clusters . subsequently",
    "kogan and shklovskii combined a more rigorous calculation with numerical simulations and found a noise spectrum where @xmath2 was considerably lower than 1 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , below a minimum frequency of order 1100 hz , the noise spectral density saturated and became a constant independent of frequency .",
    "their calculations were valid only in the high temperature regime where the impurity band was assumed to be occupied uniformly and long - range coulomb correlations were essentially neglected . since then",
    "there have been attempts to include the effects of correlations .",
    "in particular , kozub suggested a model @xcite in which electron hops within isolated pairs of impurities produce fluctuations in the potential seen by other hopping electrons that contribute to the current .",
    "while leading to @xmath0type noise within some frequency range , this model also shows low frequency noise saturation due to the exponentially small probability of finding an _ isolated _ pair of sites with a long tunneling time .",
    "moreover , the noise magnitude is predicted to increase as the temperature @xmath8 in contradiction with the recent experimental findings of massey and lee @xcite .",
    "this , in part , led massey and lee to the conclusion that the single particle picture is inconsistent with the observed noise behavior .",
    "a different approach was proposed by kogan @xcite who considered intervalley transitions as the source of the hopping conduction noise .",
    "unfortunately this approach does not seem to be analytically tractable and is not easily generalizable .    in this paper",
    "we extend kogan and shklovskii s approach @xcite by including the energy dependence of the hopping as well as the effects of electron  electron interactions on the single particle density of states @xmath9 .",
    "this is essentially a mean field approximation : we assume that charge is carried by electron - like quasiparticles whose interaction with the other charges is taken into account via the single particle density of states .",
    "later we will present some justification for why we believe this approach works for low frequency noise . for comparison",
    "we also consider the case of noninteracting electrons with a flat density of states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section iia , we describe our calculation of the noise spectral density . in section iib , we present the density of states that includes the coulomb gap and that models the decrease in the gap with increasing temperature . we show that this form of the density of states yields the usual value of the hopping exponent @xmath10 0.5 for small values of the coulomb gap width @xmath11 . however , for large values of @xmath11 , @xmath10 0.75 .",
    "both values have been seen experimentally @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we present our results .",
    "we start with a model of the coulomb glass in which electrons occupy half of the impurity sites .",
    "each site can have at most 1 electron due to a large onsite repulsion .",
    "the sites are randomly placed according to a uniform spatial distribution , and each has a random onsite energy @xmath12 chosen from a uniform distribution extending from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "thus , @xmath15 , the density of states without interactions , is flat . at @xmath16",
    "such a system is a perfect insulator while at low but finite temperatures it will be able to conduct via variable range hopping @xcite . in this picture",
    "the dc conductivity is dominated by particles hopping along the percolating network , which is constructed as follows .",
    "the resistance @xmath17 associated with a transition between sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 grows exponentially with both their separation @xmath20 and energy difference @xmath21 : @xmath22 where the prefactor @xmath23 with @xmath24 being given by @xcite @xmath25^{2}\\frac{r_{ij}^{2}}{\\xi^2 }    \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\delta^{j}_{i}\\xi}{2\\hbar          s}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{-4 }    \\label{eq : gamma0}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the deformation potential , @xmath27 is the speed of sound , @xmath28 is the mass density , @xmath29 is the localization length and @xmath30 is the dielectric constant .",

    "as we increase @xmath36 , more such pairs appear and small clusters start coalescing into bigger ones until an infinite cluster  the critical percolating network  is formed at some @xmath38 . at this point",
    "we can neglect the contribution of the remaining impurity sites to the dc conductivity since it is exponentially small compared to that of the sites already in the percolating network ( although the former sites are important for understanding both ac conductivity and noise ) . in the same spirit , the resistance of the critical percolating network is dominated by a few pairs with @xmath39  these are the pairs that bridge the gaps between large finite clusters enabling the formation of the infinite cluster . hence , the resistance of the entire sample is well approximated by @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the average value of @xmath24 given by eq .",

    ", there is no exact mapping of transport onto a percolation picture .",
    "we nevertheless assume that upon diagonalizing the interacting hamiltonian one finds that charge carrying excitations are of a local nature , and so they can be treated within the percolation picture as noninteracting quasiparticles .",
    "the coulomb interactions renormalize the single - particle density of states which acquires a soft gap .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in the section on the density of states .",

    "this is shown in figure [ fig : egvaries ] which also shows that saturation occurs in the absence of a coulomb gap when @xmath210 is increased by a factor of 20 .",
    "this saturation of the noise power occurs because the probability @xmath99 of finding a site with no neighbors closer than @xmath36 ( see eq .",
