    "those are , in any case , well known results , but analysing them in detail , in particular how the use of @xmath2 unitarity and the dominance of the top quark contribution in @xmath28 are central in the sm suppressed expectation , paves the way to understand the changes to the picture which one encounters when moving beyond the sm .",
    "in order to move beyond the sm , a general model independent analysis of np in the flavour sector could start by considering the effective hamiltonians describing a set of relevant weak transitions .",
    "model independence would be achieved by allowing all independent wilson coefficients to depart from sm values .",
    "this task would not only be daunting , but would also be very difficult to extract meaningful information from it , since the np parameters controlling the generalized wilson coefficients would typically show a high degree of degeneracy ( not to mention the experimental accuracy required to single out any interesting feature in such a scenario ) .",
    "one can consider simpler , yet interesting alternatives , by focusing on a few relevant operators that enter multiple observables .",
    "in addition , since the sm flavour picture is essentially correct , it is legitimate to circumscribe np deviations to the wilson coefficients of operators that do not arise at tree level in the sm .",
    "an approach that has been rather popular in recent times @xcite focuses on meson mixings . since the dispersive amplitudes @xmath28 arise at the loop level in the sm , they are appropriate candidates to be polluted by new physics ; the effect of having new contributions may be parameterised in the following manner ( with @xmath127 , @xmath128 , new , independent parameters ) : @xmath129_{\\text{sm}}\\,r_q^2\\,e^{-i\\,2\\phi_q}\\ .\\label{eq:33np : mix01}\\ ] ] deviations from @xmath130 describe new physics in the mixing of @xmath17 mesons . equation ( [ eq:33np : mix01 ] ) has several advantages . since @xmath131",

    "this `` factorization '' of the effects of new physics is quite convenient and @xmath137 with @xmath138 , where this separation of np is less straightforward .",

    "+ in the sm , @xmath28 is controlled by a single dimension six @xmath109 effective operator ; in eq.([eq:33np : mix01 ] ) , @xmath139 can be interpreted as the factor modifying the corresponding wilson coefficient in the presence of np .",
    "however , notice that for specific models where @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 are not independent , the situation may be more involved . + the very first question one should address when considering eq.([eq:33np : mix01 ] ) is whether this kind of modification could bring something _ really _ new to the sm picture presented in section [ sec : mix ] .",

    "@xmath101 , @xmath207 and the effective phases @xmath102 ( through @xmath84 ) and @xmath208 ( through @xmath175 ) . an important question one can ask is the following : with those ingredients , to what extent could we distinguish the two np scenarios ?",
    "that is , could we uncover eventual deviations from @xmath2 unitarity if they are indeed originating some discrepancy with respect to sm expectations ? + in figures [ fig : utmixbd:01a ] , [ fig : utmixbd:02a ] and [ fig : utmixbd:03a ] , the tree level measurements `` fix '' the @xmath209 and @xmath210 sides , together with their relative orientation given by @xmath106 .",

    "while this may seem straightforward , as soon as one concedes that only sm tree level dominated quantities are `` safe '' ( not polluted by eventual np contributions ) , none of these is useful : for the first , @xmath101 arises at one loop in the sm , invalidating the indirect obtention of @xmath211 from it , and not very constraining ones of @xmath213 ( see table [ ap : tab : data ] ) . ] ; for the second and third , the phases that are in fact measured are not @xmath155 and @xmath214 but the effective @xmath88 and @xmath215 , which may deviate from @xmath155 , @xmath214 through new contributions to @xmath143 .",
    "+ one can establish a tension with respect to the sm expectations , but this mismatch involves both the structure of the mixing matrix ( the unitarity triangle ) _ and _ the @xmath143 prediction : as soon as np introduces new parameters that break the sm connection between both , the minimal set of observables that we are considering can not indicate whether we have deviations from @xmath2 unitarity or not @xcite .",
    "the previous discussion concerns the @xmath156 sector , but the situation in the @xmath195 sector is not conceptually different .",
    "this does not mean that unitarity deviations can not be established , it only means that the rather restricted set of observables that we are considering for this general analysis is not sufficient for that task , and the following roads have to be explored .    1 .",
    "as soon as a specific model that incorporates mixings beyond the @xmath2 unitary case is considered , a specific pattern of deviations with respect to sm expectations in flavour changing processes like @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218  and others outside @xmath13 mesons systems like @xmath219 , @xmath220 or @xmath221@xmath222  and @xmath223@xmath224  oscillations  will emerge , and use made of a much larger set of experimental measurements .",

    "within the sm , the cp - violating asymmetries @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the neutral @xmath5@xmath6  and @xmath7@xmath8  mixings are expected to be naturally small .",
