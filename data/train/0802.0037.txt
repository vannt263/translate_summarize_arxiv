    "one of the most intriguing questions in the study of the formation of planets , and of terrestrial planets in particular , is how water is transported to their surfaces , and whether or not water is a common ingredient during their formation and early evolution .",
    "spatially and spectrally resolved observations of water in extrasolar planetary systems and protoplanetary disks would be instrumental in resolving these questions . unfortunately",
    ", detecting water in extrasolar planetary systems remains difficult @xcite and water in protoplanetary disks has been elusive , with only a few definitive ice @xcite and vapor @xcite detections .",
    "recently , however , the spitzer infrared spectrograph ( irs ) has begun to reveal warm water vapor emission lines from disks around classical t tauri stars ( ctts , carr & najita 2008 ) .    in this letter , we present high - resolution spectroscopy of numerous water vapor emission lines from protoplanetary disks around two ctts : dr tau and as 205a .",
    "spectra were obtained using both the spitzer - irs and nirspec @xcite at the keck ii telescope .",
    "accretion rates onto these stars are high , which causes the inner disks to be significantly hotter than in more quiescent systems .",
    "dr tau is known to have variable mass accretion , with measured rates between @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . as 205a has an accretion rate of @xmath9 and is the primary component of a 1.3  triple system , with the secondary being a spectroscopic binary @xcite .",
    "however , it is likely that the physical separation of as 205a and b is significantly larger than the projected separation and that , therefore , as 205b does not affect the ( inner ) disk of as 205a @xcite .",
    "the spitzer irs short - high ( sh ) module spectrum of as 205a was taken as part of the `` cores to disks '' ( c2d ) legacy program @xcite , while the spectrum of dr tau , observed as part of the guaranteed time observations @xcite , was obtained from the spitzer archive .",
    "the 2d basic calibrated data images were reduced using the c2d pipeline as described in @xcite .    to confirm the detections as well as measure the gas emission line profiles",
    ", we obtained high resolution ( @xmath10=@xmath11 ) l - band spectra using nirspec in a single grating setting , of which two orders , centered at 2.92@xmath0 m and 3.16@xmath0 m , respectively , have identifiable h@xmath1o and oh emission features .",
    "we also collected co @xmath4=1@xmath50 m - band spectra ( @xmath65@xmath0 m ) as part of an on - going survey ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way .",
    "division by the spectra of standard stars ( hr 1620 ( a7v ) for dr tau ; hr 5993 ( b1v ) for as 205a ) was used to correct for telluric absorption , which can be poor when the absorption is high .",
    "thus , regions of the spectrum with @xmath1270% atmospheric transmission were removed .",
    "fluxes were calibrated using the photometry and spectral types of the standards , and are generally accurate to 20% .",
    "the nirspec lines are narrow ( fwhm@xmath13 35 km s@xmath14 ) , spatially unresolved , and centered at the stellar @xmath15 @xcite to within our uncertainty ( a few km s@xmath14 )  all consistent with disk emission . because the disks are optically thick and heated from above , the line emission likely arises from the upper disk atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the irs spectra of as 205a and dr tau show a large number of water emission lines ( see figure [ irs_h2o ] ) , the vast majority pure rotational transitions with quantum numbers in the range 2050 .",
    "the @xmath16=600 resolution of the sh module results in unresolved , and significantly blended , lines .",
    "consequently , the identification with water is achieved via a simple , isothermal lte ring model computed using the hitran 2004 database @xcite .",
    "the ring model consists of a single temperature ( @xmath17 ) and column density ( @xmath18 ) gas in keplerian rotation .",
    "model parameters include @xmath17 , @xmath18 , solid angle ( @xmath19 ) , stellar mass ( @xmath20 ) , inclination ( @xmath21 ) and characteristic radius ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "in addition , the local line broadening is assumed to be gaussian , with specified width ( @xmath23 ) . @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 were fixed to values taken from the literature @xcite .",
    "the spectrally unresolved irs data can not completely constrain the remaining model parameters , but do require high @xmath17 ( @xmath24 k ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath25 @xmath26 for @xmath23@xmath62 km s@xmath14 ) .",
    "figure [ irs_h2o ] compares the irs spectra with a model in which @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constrained using the nirspec data described below , but where @xmath19 has been increased by a factor of 2 .",
    "the addition of co@xmath1 ( and , for as 205a , oh ) improves our fits , as shown by the as 205a model in fig .",
    "[ irs_h2o ] . with",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath19 fixed , we find h@xmath1o : co@xmath1=40 for dr tau and 20 for as 205 .",
    "detections of these and other molecules will be discussed in detail elsewhere .      while tropospheric water vapor blocks significant portions of incoming radiation near 3@xmath0 m , there are a handful of rovibrational lines that are optically thin in the atmosphere but readily excited at temperatures typical of the inner @xmath61 au of circumstellar disks .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ nirspec ] , in which spectral regions with @xmath1270% atmospheric transmission have been removed , yet many prominent ( line - to - continuum@xmath6510% ) h@xmath1o emission features remain .",
    "these are primarily @xmath27 lines , with upper level energies of @xmath65,00010,000 k. a few weaker ( line - to - continuum@xmath61% ) features are nominally detected from 3.133.18 @xmath0 m and are used as model constraints .",
    "we also detect the p4.5 ( 2.9344@xmath0 m ; @xmath28@xmath6@xmath29 k ) and p9.5 ( 3.1788@xmath0 m ; @xmath28@xmath6@xmath30 k ) oh doublets .",
    "the m - band spectra include portions of the @xmath2co/@xmath3co @xmath4=1@xmath50 and @xmath2co v=2@xmath51 p- and r - branches ( figure [ rotfit ] ) .",
    "we fit all spectra with the ring models described in  [ sec : spitzer ] .",
    "because the co lines span a large range of excitation energies , across which they transition from optically thick to optically thin , @xmath18 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 can be determined uniquely .",
    "also , a constraint on @xmath31 is provided by the @xmath3co lines ( assuming a @xmath2co:@xmath3co ratio , here fixed at 77 , c.f .",
    "thus , we began by fitting the co emission by comparison with an excitation diagram of the @xmath4=1@xmath50 transitions ( fig .",
    "[ rotfit ] ) , as described in @xcite . for our nominal h@xmath1o and",
    "oh fits , we then fixed @xmath19 and @xmath17 to the co - derived values to determine @xmath18  a reasonable , though not ideal , assumption , given the similarity in line shapes ( see fig .",
    "[ rotfit ] ) .    our nominal ring model is shown in figure [ nirspec ] , with best - fit parameters in table [ fit_parameters ] , and uncertainties of order @xmath32@xmath6@xmath33 , @xmath34@xmath6@xmath35 and @xmath36@xmath6@xmath37 .",
    "we have fixed @xmath38 au to roughly match the emission profiles since the lineshape does not affect the integrated flux ; we discuss lineshapes below .",
    "@xmath19 corresponds to areas of 0.2 and 0.4 au@xmath39 for dr tau and as 205 , respectively , at distances of 140 and 120 pc .",
    "uncertainties in the nominal h@xmath1o and oh fits are linked to co uncertainties , but if @xmath17 is instead allowed to vary , the h@xmath1o spectra are consistent with @xmath17@xmath69001200/9001100 k for dr tau / as 205a and ranges in @xmath18 of about 1 order of magnitude . for oh",
    ", we can only constrain @xmath17 900 k.    the model results depend crucially on the assumed local line width ( @xmath23 ) , which is unknown . for our nominal model ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath40 km s@xmath14  the sound speed for h@xmath1 at 1000 k. however , we have also tested values between @xmath60.3 and 10 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we find that the opacity needs to remain similar from fit to fit , so that a change in @xmath41 requires a proportional change in @xmath18 . to maintain the flux level ,",
    "the total number of molecules must remain similar , so an increase in @xmath23 implies a decrease in @xmath19 .",
    "accordingly , the co : h@xmath1o ratio changes by no more than a factor of @xmath6 2 between models .",
    "( if @xmath42 is not fixed , however , this ratio may change ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath17 is only weakly affected by @xmath23 , since it is set by the overall shape of the spectrum , rather than by the absolute flux levels .",
    "nirspec spectrally resolves the molecular emission , allowing an investigation of the disk gas kinematics . in fig .",
    "[ rotfit ] we compare the unblended h@xmath1o transition at 2.931 @xmath0 m with a co line composite constructed from an average of all @xmath4=1@xmath50 lines . in general , keplerian disks should produce double - peaked emission profiles , with peak separation set by the inner and outer emission radii ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , as well as the temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "the co and h@xmath1o line profiles , however , are more gaussian , or even lorentzian in shape , with relatively wide wings and a narrow peak .",
    "the narrow core could be produced by a ring with a very large @xmath43 ( @xmath4510 au ) if the peak - to - peak separation is equal to the nirspec resolution ( given the @xmath20 and @xmath21 in table [ fit_parameters ] ) .",
    "however , this is difficult to reconcile with the high @xmath17 derived from the model fits and the observed line wings .",
    "another way to produce a single peak would be to have the line emission extend to significant radii ( @xmath44 of order 7 au , for a temperature profile that is constant with radius ) , such that the contribution from low - velocity portions of the disk infills the center of the line profile .",
    "however , this model produces too much flux to match observations .",
    "additionally , passive disk models predict a steep temperature decline with radius .",
    "a more promising solution may be that some flux is produced via fluorescence , in which molecules in the flared outer disk ( typically out to @xmath65 au ) intercept and re - radiate inner disk ir continuum , thus filling in the line profiles at low velocity @xcite . with canonical disk flaring and temperature structure , we find that a resonance fluorescence model with 100% scattering efficiency can indeed produce fluxes comparable to those of thermal emission ; a more thorough investigation is left as future work",
    ".    in any case , the amount of flux in the line profile wings is consistent with emission arising in a keplerian disk with a small inner radius . with this assumption",
    ", the line wing velocity can be used to estimate @xmath43 . because turbulent motion and disk structure can both have non - negligible effects on the line shapes , we adopt here the velocity , @xmath46 , at 2.2 times the half width at half maximum  a value found to be appropriate for the moderate - inclination disk around gm aur @xcite . to compute @xmath46 we use gaussian fits to the co and h@xmath1o lines discussed above , as well as the average of two - gaussian fits to the oh emission doublets , deconvolved with the nirspec instrument response function .",
    "if turbulent velocities are low , radii associated with @xmath46 will be overestimates , and so we also compute @xmath4 at 3@xmath23 , which should represent a lower limit to @xmath43 ( see table [ fit_parameters ] ) .",
    "we have convincingly detected h@xmath1o emission in the 1020 @xmath0 m region with spitzer - irs as well as h@xmath1o and oh emission near 3 @xmath0 m with nirspec , arising from the disk atmospheres surrounding two ctts . by combining these data with constraints from spectrally resolved co @xmath4=1@xmath50 emission , we find that the excitation temperatures are typical of terrestrial planet forming regions ( @xmath61000 k ) . additionally , line wing velocities imply inner emission radii no larger than 1 au for all molecules . therefore , further observations and analyses of these species may provide a new window into terrestrial planet forming regions .",
    "observations of h@xmath1o in disks may also provide constraints on disk evolution and water transport . in a disk in which water vapor transport",
    "is controlled by diffusion , the presence of a condensation front ( ` snow line ' ) can potentially dry out an inner disk in as little as @xmath47 yr , for typical disk viscosities @xcite .",
    "the snow line for the early solar system is estimated to be near 3 au , but would be further out for these high accretion rate stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the presence of significant water vapor inside 1 au may be evidence for inward radial migration , or upward mixing , of icy solids , followed by evaporation . with both solid migration and diffusion controlling water transport ,",
    "water vapor concentrations become sensitive to an array of parameters , including disk viscosity and planetesimal growth rates , and water concentrations may trace disk evolution @xcite .",
    "the detection of strong oh emission is also interesting , for oh is known to be an important ingredient to the chemistry in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks .",
    "it also acts as a coolant near the disk surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and photolysis of oh to o(@xmath48d ) has been invoked to explain the observed strengths of the 6300  o i line @xcite .",
    "detections of oh in these and other disks will be discussed in greater detail in mandell et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    "an understanding of the local line broadening in disks will be crucial for obtaining accurate absolute column densities of molecular species , as smaller local line widths require lower column densities and vice versa .",
    "nevertheless , we find that molecular ratios are more robust , and remain similar when utilizing different disk models with the nominal fits having co : h@xmath1o@xmath61015 and h@xmath1o : oh@xmath634 , provided @xmath49 .",
    "stronger constraints on both @xmath17 and @xmath18 will require high line - to - continuum observations across a wider wavelength range , but the available data reveal that h@xmath1o : co is similar to , or slightly higher than that in the dense clouds out of which disks form @xcite .",
    "vertically integrated h@xmath1o : oh ratios have been predicted to be much higher ( @xmath50 ) near 1 au @xcite , but significant oh abundances are expected near the c@xmath51/c / co transition zone at large scale heights @xcite . also , it is important to keep in mind that disk transport is not included in current chemical models .",
    "our analysis of the l- and m - band spectra thus far has assumed thermal excitation of the vibrationally excited states , but this need not be the case",
    ". @xmath52=1 emission can also be driven by the stellar uv output or by the absorption of ir photons from the star or disk , followed by fluorescence @xcite . for oh",
    ", vibrationally excited emission can also result from the ( photo)dissociation of h@xmath1o followed by prompt emission @xcite .",
    "in fact , fluorescence may be necessary to explain observed line profile shapes ( see  [ sec : nirspec ] ) , and could explain the surprisingly strong oh emission .",
    "a better understanding of these processes may therefore prove essential for relating observed line fluxes to disk column densities .",
    "if emission in the line wings truly represents emission from the disk inner radius , relatively large inner emission radii are implied for co , oh , and h@xmath1o . both dr tau and as 205a",
    "have had their dust inner rim sizes measured with the keck interferometer . at @xmath53 and @xmath54 au , respectively , they are consistent with the location of dust sublimation @xcite , while the inner emission radii we derive are at least 3 times larger .",
    "perhaps these high accretion - rate stars can stir up the inner disk enough to erase the vertical temperature gradients necessary for formation of emission lines .",
    "another possibility may be that replenishment rates can not keep up with photo - dissociation at the disk surface .",
    "the ease with which h@xmath1o and oh are now detected in the terrestrial planet - forming zones of certain disks holds the promise of more extensive and detailed studies .",
    "although the ground based echelle observations presented here probe only the inner disk atmospheres , future high spectral resolution follow - up studies of spitzer - detected water emission from protoplanetary disks will provide constraints at a variety of disk radii and vertical depths . additionally , spectro - astrometric observations are being used to directly constrain emitting location and structure of the molecular gas @xcite .",
    "eventually , a suite of constraints combined with non - lte radiative transfer models will allow us to rigorously address such far - reaching questions as : how does the water vapor abundance vary within and between disks ?",
    "what constraints can be put on models for the chemistry and transport of volatiles in disks , and what implications will these have for the early evolution of the solar system ?",
