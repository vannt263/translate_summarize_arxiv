    "+ due to the different wavebands required for detections at different redshifts and the strong evolution of the lyman forest , a variety of different techniques and observational strategies have to be applied for finding and identifying absorbers .",
    "detection of the 1032/1038 doublet from ground based telescopes is only possible beyond redshifts of @xmath72.0 due to the 3000  atmospheric cutoff , and thus studies of the absorber statistics below this threshold need to rely on space - based instruments .",
    "@xcite conducted the first systematic survey of absorbers at z @xmath8 1.0 , employing fos on hst to study a sample of 11 qsos , and found 12 suitable candidates of which 9 were expected to be real , thus establishing that the number density per redshift interval of these absorbers is similar to , if not greater than , that for and absorbers at the same redshift .",

    "what type of absorbers do we expect to detect via such a direct search without a priori selecting on other transitions ? if a sightline passes through a galaxy , and if there are analogues to local examples surveyed early by @xcite and @xcite for highly ionised metals in absorption , we anticipate to detect in such cases mixed with in the gas phase inside that galaxy , like in the disk of our galaxy . furthermore , a recent , thorough examination of fuse spectra @xcite revealed the occurence of local absorbers in almost all of the more than 100 sightlines probed by extragalactic background objects , indicating a large covering fraction when a sightline passes the galaxy . while the majority of these absorbers are probably located within the galaxy @xcite , especially the high - velocity ( relative to the local standard of rest )",
    "traces a variety of different environments and phenomena , most likely including warm / hot gas interaction in an extended galactic corona and even truly intergalactic gas within the local group @xcite . as an aside , the gas residing in the background agn host galaxy is subject to a strong uv radiation field by the central engine itself , and thus might contain more than normal galaxies . and while we are per se not interested in such absorbers for the study of intergalactic gas , we have included intrinsic absorbers , as they are being found with our algorithm as well .",
    "+ from hydrodynamic simulations @xcite assert , however , that the majority of detectable lines with rest frame equivalent widths ew@xmath26 do _ not _ reside in virialised regions like galaxies , groups and clusters , but trace intergalactic gas at only moderate overdensities ( @xmath810 - 40 ) .",
    "although their estimated redshift path density of about 5 such absorbers per redshift of unity drops rapidly by a factor of at least ten when increasing the equivalent width limit to 0.35  , even that lower rate of incidence allows us to detect an appreciable number of such strong intergalactic absorbers , owing to the large redshift path length probed by the collective sdss agn sample .",
    "+ to summarise , we expect to detect the signals of absorbers in a variety of environments . while this first step of finding rests upon a blind doublet search plus an alignment with lyman @xmath0 and @xmath27 lines , in order to ensure high purity of the candidate sample , we may then , in a future effort , use independent line detections of different ions to better characterise the physical stae and potentially the nature of the absorbers found here .",
    "because there are a variety of possible origins of the ovi gas , including outflows , intervening galaxies , and the contribution of the agn host galaxy , this next step is needed to arrive at a sample of igm absorbers .",
    "there is evidence for a population of absorbers that contain little , if any detectable hydrogen , as pointed out by @xcite , and it is clear that our search algorithm presented here can not detect those .",
    "however , as we anticipate the need for high - resolution follow - up of our candidates in order to confirm their nature , we might then be able to learn about this oxygen - rich subset ( type 0 of @xcite ) of absorbers as well .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : section [ prelim ] details our preliminary analyses of whether the signal - to - noise ratio of the sdss spectra and the density of the lyman forest enables our search program .",
    "in section [ agn_sample ] we present our sdss qso sample selection , and section [ search_strategy ] gives an overview of the search algorithms we applied . before we summarise and conclude in section [ summary ] , we present the results of our search in section [ candidate_list ] .",
    "the search method developed here can be easly tailored to a variety of different ionic species .",
    "we stress that follow - up observations of the candidates we retrieve with high s / n and high resolution is neccessary to determine the reliability of our search algorithm by determining the nature of the features we detect .",
    "+ throughout this study we use a cosmology with h@xmath28=71 km s@xmath29mpc@xmath29 , @xmath30 = 0.27 and @xmath31=0.73 .",
    "abundances are given by number relative to hydrogen , and vacuum wavelength are being used , if not otherwise noted .",
    "with rest - frame wavelengths below the lyman @xmath0 wavelength of 1215.67  , the 1032/1038 doublet absorption lines inevitably fall into the lyman alpha forest of systems located along the same sightline with slightly lower redshifts .",
    "thus , two effects may prohibit our attempts to find such absorbers : first , the ubiquity of the ly@xmath0 forest lines , especially at higher redshifts , can lead to blending of the oxygen lines with lines , thus rendering a correct identification of the doublet impossible .",
    "second , two different ly @xmath0 lines at different redshifts and the accidental occurence of optical depth ratios expected for can mimic an doublet , leading to a false identification .      in order to estimate the severity of the latter effect , we have created mock catalogues of lyman forests lines , using the line density estimate of @xcite and the column density distribution function of @xcite : @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the number of lyman @xmath0 lines per redshift interval dz , and f(n@xmath35 ) is the probability distribution of obtaining a line with column density of neutral hydrogen n@xmath35 within the interval n@xmath35 , n@xmath35+dn@xmath35 .",
    "we then analysed these catalogs , and retrieved all line pairs that exhibit the correct wavelength ratio ( within a given tolerance ) as well as the correct ratio of optical depths at the line center : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 is independent of redshift since both lines get shifted by the same factor ( 1+z ) , and the result for @xmath39 follows from atomic physics : @xmath40 where n is the column density , @xmath41 the wavelength of the transition , c the speed of light , a@xmath42 the einstein - coefficient for the transition from the upper ( k ) to the lower ( j ) level , b@xmath43 the line broadening factor .",
    "the statistical weights @xmath44 of the two transitions is equal to two .",
    "+ with the given resolution of sdss spectra ( r@xmath81800 ) and the conservative assumption that line centroids can be determined to about 1/3 of the resolution element , we expect a tolerance level for the wavelength ratio of @xmath45 = 3.0@xmath4610@xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , we can rule out all pairs that do not exhibit the range of flux decrements , expected from the ratios of the two line strengths convolved with the instrument capabilities .",
    "the efficiency of this procedure depends crucially on the ability to precisely measure the equivalent width ( ew ) of lines , but even a conservative estimate of a 20% accuracy on a single pixel flux measurement , corresponding to a low signal - to - noise ratio of about 5 , leads to a reduction of the number of false detections of roughly a factor of eight at all redshifts . +",
    "an analysis of the mock data sets spanning the complete redshift range available to us ( 2.7 @xmath48(sdss ) ) and varying the thresholds on the desired precision for @xmath38 and @xmath39 yields for the number of expected interlopers : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the absorber redshift , and @xmath51 is the number of expected absorbers per spectrum .",
    "n@xmath52 is a strongly increasing function of the redshift : @xmath53 note that the coefficients and exponents in equations [ interlopers ] and [ g_z ] are derived from analysing the mock data set , without taking additional absorption from metal lines into account . nor",
    "did we analyse the contribution of random noise features mimicking doublets . the latter problem , however , is obviated by the fact that we are going to focus on lines that are clearly above the noise limit , as we will explain in section 3 .",
    "+ we focus on absorbers accompanied by strong lyman absorption [ o / h ] @xmath54 0 ) .",
    "such absorbers , classified by bergeron & herbert - fort as type 0 , could potentially slip through our search criterion as they need not be accompanied by strong absorption . a priori we can not determine which fraction of these absorbers we might lose , some of them exhibit strong enough absorption to pass our criteria ( right panel fig . 2 of bergeron & herbert - fort ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "] . therefore , we rule out all lines that do not show accompanying transitions .",
    "given the line density estimate of @xcite , the lower limit for the average velocity separation of two lyman @xmath0 absorbers is @xmath55 where we used the relation @xmath56 to obtain the lower limit in the last step , and equated @xmath57 .",
    "+ the velocity separation of one pixel in sdss spectra , however , amounts to @xmath58 thus , the probability to have at least one line fall right onto the pixel corresponding to the redshift of an `` pixel '' is @xmath59 note that the @xcite line density includes lyman @xmath0 absorbers with column densities as low as log n@xmath35 = 13.64 . restricting ourselves to absorbers that show at least an optical depth at line centre for the lyman @xmath27 line of @xmath60(lyman @xmath27 ) = 1.0 , leads to another factor of f@xmath61 0.4 in the exclusion of spurious interlopers",
    "therefore , we can further reduce the number of spurious interlopers by @xmath62 , at least , by requiring the candidate feature to be accompanied by strong lyman @xmath0 and @xmath27 absorption . since higher order series lines become rather weak , adding additional components",
    "probably does not follow the same simple multiplicative propagation of probabilities , and so we have considered in this feasibility study only the first two terms of the lyman series . +     of the absorber . the rapid increase for the lines up to log ( 1+z@xmath63 ( = z@xmath6 3.4 ) can mainly be attributed to the nearly linearly growing redshift pathlength , whereas the rapid increase of interlopers is due to the redshift evolution of the line density .",
    "we assume an [ o / h ] = -2.0 to calculate the number of absorbers by integrating over the column density distribution by hu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , after assessing a correction factor for the fraction of lines retrievable ( for details see section 2.2 ) . the red , dashed curve represents the expected number of interlopers that exhibit less than a fiducial value for the deviations in both line position and line strength ( for details see text ) , whereas the dotted line takes the additional requirement into account that the interlopers have to show associated , strong absorption .",
    "it is obvious that our search efficiency peaks around a redshift of z@xmath6 3.2 , and rapidly deteriorates for redshifts z@xmath64 .",
    "thus , we expect our  window of opportunity  to be between 2.8 @xmath65 4.0 , where the ratio of detections of real systems to spurious interlopers is greater than unity.,title=\"fig:\"][expected_lines ]    figure 1 shows in red the number of expected interlopers without ( dashed ) or with ( dotted ) the additional requirement of accompanying lyman @xmath0 and @xmath27 absorption . for these calculations",
    "we have used the fiducial values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 . introducing the additional requirement",
    "significantly reduces the number of false positives , as figure 1 demonstrates .",
    "+ finally , we can also disqualify a potential candidate as belonging to an doublet if it is clear that it is part of a lyman series itself , i.e. we can check whether there are lower ( or also higher ) lyman transitions at the same redshift with similar velocity structures .",
    "this cut becomes possible for all lines above 4500  when the lyman @xmath27 line redshifts into the lower wavelength regime of sdss .",
    "thus , we expect to even further reduce the number of falsely classified absorbers beyond a redshift of z@xmath68 3.37 by a large fraction .",
    "another criterion that can be used to correctly identify a metal line doublet is the shape of the lines : both are expected to have the same velocity structure and should be rather narrow , in stark contrast to the lyman lines that tend to be broader than 20 km / s . due to the low resolution of sdss spectra ,",
    "however , this criterion can not be implemented here unless the line is so strong that its width exceeds one resolution element . such strongly saturated or even damped lines are rare , and",
    "would have been picked up by other automatic search algorithms already , as we describe later .",
    "+ we will discuss the implementation and success of these and various other criteria to distinguish real lines from features mimicking metal lines in section 3 .      in order to estimate whether blending and/or noise renders the identification of existing doublets in the lyman forest impossible , we have created 100 mock spectra of a typical lyman forest , following the number and column density distributions from above , and adjusting the spectral resolution and pixel size to the sdss fiducial value . for the doppler broadening parameter , we have assumed a gaussian distribution of width 8 km / s around a mean of @xmath69 , the exact values for the distribution are , however , not important at this stage of modelling , as the instrumental resolution broadens the line profiles over more than the average velocity width . in this forest",
    "we placed doublets at a redshift of about 3.5 , added noise according to the appropriate ( worst - case ) sdss scenario ( i.e. we have chosen a value of s / n = 3 here , which is below the nominal s / n @xmath70 4 sdss limit , see section 3.3 for details of the sdss sample s s / n ) , and checked carefully how often we could reliably retrieve the doublet , when varying the strength of the absorption feature ( until it completely vanished in the noise ) .",
    "figure 2 shows two examples : in the first , both components are clearly identified , whereas in the second , both are severely blended .",
    "of course , stronger lines can be identified more easily . from this analyis",
    ", we conclude that at least 15% of systems with an ew = log ( ew@xmath71 can be unambigiously identified at a redshift of z @xmath8 3.5 , and hence higher fractions at lower z or greater strength . because the modelling at this stage is only suppposed to render an initial estimate of the line detectability , we have not included second - order effects like line clustering , or a detailed description of the effects of continuum placement errors .",

    "therefore , we had to develop our own algorithms to construct a complete list of absorbers at intervening redshifts . after completing our search with this method",
    ", we performed a cross - check with the qsoals database to see if the putative candidates also show transitions of other ions at the same redshift .",
    "the results of these checks are summarised in section 5.1 .      for a median doppler broadening parameter @xmath91 = 16 km / s , obtained by simcoe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , it is obvious that nearly all of the lines that we expect to be present in sdss spectra will not be resolved , as 1  ( i.e. the rough pixel size ) represents about 70 km / s in velocity space at 4000  , where we expect to have the best search efficiency .",
    "nonetheless , we implemented a simple pixel by pixel comparison for all spectra , characterising each single pixel within the wavelength range from the blue sdss limit of 3800  up to the maximum wavelength allowed for the 1032 component @xmath92  by its normalised flux and thus optical depth . for each pixel",
    ", we derive its hypothetical absorption redshift z@xmath24 as if it were the 1032 component .",
    "then we identify the corresponding pixels in the spectra that would belong to the second 1038 component as well as the lyman @xmath0,@xmath27 and , if possible , @xmath93 lines for that same redshift . naturally , the overlap between the redshifted wavelength range of the 1032 component pixel and the actual wavelength range of the pixel containing the corresponding 1038 component is not perfect . and thus , the absorption structure of the 1038 transition corresponding to its 1032  counterpart can span in principle two pixels , and hence the _ ratio _ of the absorption measured in such pairs of 1032/1038 pixels may not be a reliable quantity for identifying anymore .",
    "the estimates of the line widths above , however , demonstrate that the velocity width of a line is most likely going to be only a small fraction of the width of a single pixel - and so this scenario will occur only in a small number of cases .",
    "furthermore , by coincidence , the wavelength separation of the pixels in sdss spectra and wavelength ratio specific to the doublet create an overlap at the level of 0.94 for all spectra and all pixels .",
    "we did , additionally , check for potential candidates in the pixel pairs that do overlap by only 6% , but the number of candidates retrieved in this way agreed well with just the expectations from random interlopers .",
    "we therefore estimate that the loss of valid detections due to this complication is minimal .      in order to assess whether an absorption feature exhibits the correct ratio of optical depths while not being able to fully resolve the structure of the absorption lines , we need to derive a quantitative measure of that ratio from the observed normalised fluxes per pixel .",
    "assume that a ) the complete profile of an transition fits into one resolution element , and b ) that this line is the only absorption line within that element ( i.e. no blending with lyman lines ) .",
    "then , it is possible to extract the equivalent width of the in that pixel from the measured normalised flux as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the equivalent width of the line in that pixel in the observer s frame , @xmath96 is the pixel size in wavelength units , and @xmath97 is the normalised flux of the pixel assumed to contain the 1032 transition . from this estimate of the equivalent width @xmath95 , we can in turn derive the expected flux @xmath98 at the corresponding pixel : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the ratio of equivalent widths of the two transitions .",
    "this ratio depends on the strength and velocity width of the absorber .",
    "for unsaturated lines it remains fairly close to 2 , and drops to unity for saturated lines .",
    "we have modelled the 1032 and 1038  transitions with voigt profiles of various doppler parameters @xmath101 , and are thus able to compute : @xmath102 as a function of the estimated equivalent width ew@xmath103 .",
    "this introduces a model dependence into our derivation as we need to assume a value for the doppler parameter @xmath101 .",
    "we find , however , that even large variations of the doppler parameter , @xmath104 , only affect @xmath105 on the 30% level . here",
    "we take @xmath106 as fiducial value for the doppler parameter .",
    "+ the following criteria were used to classify pixels as candidates belonging to an doublet .    1 .   both pixels of the doublet candidate",
    "need to exhibit normalised fluxes lower than 1.0 .",
    "this simply ensures that absorption features rather than pixels whose noise pushed them over the flux level of unity are selected .",
    "2 .   the expected flux @xmath98 is allowed to deviate from the actually measured flux @xmath107 less than a certain threshold @xmath108 where @xmath86 is the standard deviation of this flux difference , estimated from the signal - to - noise ratio of each pixel and the uncertainty on the line width mentioned above .",
    "the effects of varying @xmath109 will be described in the next section .",
    "the inferred equivalent width of the stronger 1032 component has to be above a minimum limit @xmath110 this enables us to clear our candidate lists from very weak features , i.e. spurious lyman @xmath0 forest lines with low column densities which we expect to be the main contaminant at high redshifts .",
    "note that this criterion is usually automatically fulfilled for candidates in spectra with low signal - to - noise ratio passing criterion 4 mentioned below , and thus is mostly useful for cases where the signal - to - noise ratio is significantly above the 4.0 threshold for entering the sample .",

    "requiring a high significance for each pixel allows us to focus on absorption lines with a high likelihood of being real , rather than noise artifacts .",
    "in contrast to criterion 3 , this cut proves most useful in spectra with low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "note that this criterion introduces a lower threshold for the equivalent width that is signal - to - noise ratio - dependent : at a fiducial average signal - to - noise ratio of 5.0 ( 8.0 ) and a significance level of 4.0 @xmath86 ( 2.0 @xmath86 ) , it corresponds to a rest - frame equivalent width limit for the sdss set - up of ew@xmath113 = 0.195  ( 0.06  ) .",
    "since we expect to be accompanied by lyman features , we require @xmath114 where the x represents either lyman @xmath115 or - if applicable - @xmath93 . due to a lack of information regarding the metallicity and the physical state of the absorbing gas",
    ", there is , a priori , no straight forward way of calculating the absorption expected for a given value of @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , we introduce these hard cuts on the flux for the associated lyman series transitions , and resort to this simple , yet efficient method of checking for accompanying absorption .",
    "we reject all candidates that show signs of being part of lyman series absorption , i.e. we check ( by eye ) whether the feature in question could be a lyman line , accompanied by higher ( or lower ) series members elsewhere in the spectrum with a similar velocity structure .",
    "this turns out not to be a severe cut : only 4 of altogether 1760 candidates passing all other tests had to be eliminated by this procedure .",
    "thus , we find it unnecessary to apply a more rigorous test than this check by eye .",
    "it is clear that the efficiency of detecting candidates and filtering out spurious lyman series absorbers is a complicated function of redshift and signal - to - noise ratio of each spectrum .",
    "thus , a more flexible approach , tailored to each object , could result in a higher overall yield .",
    "we have , nevertheless , applied the aforementioned rigorous , yet simple strategy to the complete sample regardless of redshift and signal - to - noise ratio of each source .",
    "this allows for a more straightforward comparison of the results with expectations based upon our initial feasibility study , and certainly facilitates quantitative analyses like completeness estimates . and",
    "it is certainly the conservative approach .",
    "+ we note that possible blends of the two 1032/1038  transitions with other lines at very similar rest - wavelengths constitute an additional complication .",
    "specifically , the presence of strong lines of might have the 1036  line of overlapping with 1038  , and potentialy shift this blend to a lower wavelength .",
    "also , any system that contains appreciable amounts of molecular hydrogen , h2 , will also produce a blend with the 1038  transition , but leave the 1032  component untainted . at the redshift range of interest for us , however , the separation between the and 1038  line centres amounts to at least 6 (observed frame ) , too much to seriously affect our search criteria .",
    "hence , we have not implemented any correction factors due to the presence of these features into our search algorithms .",

    ", we compare the pros and cons of the two possible approaches , and explain why we have chosen to use the single pixel search method .",

    "hence we need to try both to maximise the number of absorbers found and the cleanliness of the sample .",
    "it is immediately obvious that increasing the s / n of the basic search bin ( pixel vs. resolution element ) could indeed be very helpful to increase the number of absorbers we can hope to find , given the often very low quality of the spectra with s / n per pixel of the order of a few . on the other hand ,",
    "smoothing over a larger bin size increases the probability of hi interlopers falling within the bin distorting the flux measurement in a good candidate , or creating new bad candidates by mimicking an ovi doublet .",
    "therefore , it is a priori not clear which method is favourable .",
    "+ in order to decide upon a quantitative argument , we have indeed smoothed all 3702 spectra to the nominal resolution of the sdss spectrograph by running a gaussian filter with the appropriate fwhm over each spectrum .",
    "the oversampling factor is about 2.5 , and hence we gain roughly a factor of @xmath141 in s / n for each pixel .",

    "it is this latter point that clearly favours the implementation of the one - pixel search strategy , given the goal of a candidate list that is as clean as possible under the given noise and resolution constraints of sdss .",
    "note that the number of detected candidates and random interloper estimates depends strongly on the cut criteria introduced in section 4.1.1 .",
    "the specific values we have adopted were chosen to achieve an optimal result for the single - pixel method .",
    "is it possible to change those parameters for the new search in order to achieve a lower fraction of interlopers ? we have tested this by varying the cut values over a wide range of the parameter space , just like we did for the original one - pixel search as detailed in section 4.1.2 . , but could not find any combination of them that had the interloper fraction drop below 75% .",
    "this is highlighted in figure 10 , that can directly be compared to figure 4 : it is evident that the number of detections rises by a factor of about 5 - 8 for all cut criteria , but the fraction of random interlopers increases even more dramatically all across the board ( red lines in the figure ) .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising given that the initial feasibility analysis showed that by increasing the s / n the ratio of real - to - random candidates should also increase",
    ". a potential complication may be the clustering of ( stronger ) lyman forest features , that could increase the number of interlopers .",
    "the overlap fraction between candidates found in both the single - pixel approach and the search after smoothing may appear on first glance low .",
    "specifically , of the 1756 candidate systems from the former method only 543 remain after smoothing ( 31 % ) , while our estimate of the fraction of real absorbers vs. spurious interlopers and noise artifacts indicates that 69 percent of the the candidates should show a true ovi profile and hence extend over more than one pixel , i.e. are suitable for a successful resolution detection . in the following ,",
    "we investigate how these two seemingly contradicting numbers can be reconciled .    while binning the spectra to the instrumental resolution of sdss , i.e. combining the flux from 2 - 3 adjacent pixels , certainly reduces the noise , but since the absorption in neighbouring pixels is typically weaker one may actually lower the signal - to - noise ratio of the candidate . a priori , it is difficult to assess how the detectability of lines is affected by this modification of the search routine .",
    "hence , we have resorted to a monte - carlo analysis , creating new data sets of mock absorbers in resolution space based upon the candidates specifications obtained in the single pixel search .",
    "these new sets of candidates were scrutinised by the same algorithm we used to search for absorbers in the real , smoothed spectra .",
    "the recipe for creating one such new data set is as follows : we begin by extracting for each candidate the relevant flux and noise value at each pixel in question for the search criteria ( i.e. ovi 1032 & 1038 , ly @xmath115 , and @xmath93 ( when possible ) ) . in order to estimate the expected flux values in adjacent pixels",
    ", we simply create a voigt profile which needs to reproduce the flux in the central pixel and has an appropriate doppler parameter ( fixed to b @xmath8 14 km / s for the ovi , and b @xmath8 35 km / s for hi ) . to these expected fluxes in the 2 adjacent pixels ,",
    "we add noise at the level found for that central pixel .",
    "then we combine the information of the new set of pixels according to the method used for the smoothing of the data , i.e. adding and averaging the fluxes while adding the noise in quadrature only .",
    "hence , we derive for each candidate of the one pixel search a new set of flux and noise values in the relevant transitions . in this way , we construct a new sample of artificially created potential resolution candidates , based upon the assumption that the one - pixel flux values found in our search represent the depression of flux in the centre of the line . the new sample",
    "is then subjected to the same search algorithm we used for the real rebinned spectra , and the fraction of candidates passing the search criteria is noted .",
    "we repeat this procedure for 10,000 versions of such mock lists , in order to estimate the expectation value and its scatter for the number of candidates remaining . from this simple procedure ,",
    "we derive an average `` retention rate '' of 38 @xmath142 3 percent , only slightly higher than the value for the overlap percentage in the real data sets .",
    "it seems plausible that allowing for more complicated scenarios ( line centres not exactly at central pixel , correlated noise , range of doppler parameters for underlying profiles , etc ... ) the fraction could be pushed even lower , and hence we conclude that it is not a sign of our search algorithms being unreliable when finding a low overlap percentage ."
