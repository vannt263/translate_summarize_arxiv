    "an analogy would be a spectroscopic measurement where one instrument scans over few energy spots to represent the whole spectrum using empirical function , while the another instrument scans the whole energy landscape to describe the system .",
    "then the former is the conventional nonlinear fitting methods and the latter is the method presented here . since the whole frequency region and the complex permittivity have been employed without a base function ( _ e.g. _ havriliak - negami@xcite , stretch exponential@xcite , etc . ) , the data analyzed by two different analysts would be the same ; no initial guess for the fit parameters are needed that would be different for the analysts .",
