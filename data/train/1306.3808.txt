    "let @xmath0 be a connected undirected graph consisting of @xmath1 nodes and @xmath2 edges , and denote by @xmath3 the adjacency matrix of @xmath4 , whose entry @xmath5 if there is an edge between node @xmath6 and node @xmath7 , while @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "let us consider a random walk on @xmath4 described by a time - invariant transition matrix @xmath9 .",
    "at each time step , a walker moves from the current node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 with a probability @xmath10 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath11 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath12 .    according to this definition ,",
    "a walk on @xmath4 corresponds to a discrete time - invariant markov chain defined by the transition matrix @xmath13 on the state space @xmath14 .",
    "let us now consider an instance @xmath15 of the walk defined by @xmath13 on @xmath4 , and a real - valued property of node @xmath6 , @xmath16 .",
    "if we indicate as @xmath17 the sequence of nodes visited by @xmath15 , we can construct the time series @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath19 , we get the time series @xmath20 of the degrees of the visited nodes .",
    "( sf ) , the internet at the level of autonomous systems ( internet ) and the collaboration network of scientists in condensed matter ( scn ) .",
    "panel ( c ) : the dfa of the time series reveals two distinct scaling regimes in the internet and in scn , while the fluctuations in er and sf networks are compatible with gaussian noise . the plots in ( b ) and ( c ) have been vertically displaced to improve readability . , width=288 ]    we denote such time series as @xmath21 , because it depends on the node property @xmath22 , and on the specific order in which the nodes are visited by the walk .",
    "however , if the walk defined by the transition matrix @xmath13 on @xmath4 is irreducible , then the topology of @xmath4 completely determines which sequences of values can be produced by the walk and with which frequency  @xcite .",
    "hence , any two time series @xmath23 and @xmath24 constructed from two walkers @xmath25 and @xmath26 on @xmath4 corresponding to the same walk rule @xmath13 and the same node property @xmath22 will have , for @xmath27 , the same statistical properties , and will carry the same information about the structure of @xmath4 .",
    "we can therefore indicate any time series produced by a transition matrix @xmath13 and by node property @xmath22 as @xmath28 .",
    "we will now show that the analysis of the time series produced by different node properties @xmath22 can provide useful insights on the microscopic structure of a complex network and about its overall organization .",
    "we focus on the case of classical random walks , i.e. we set @xmath29 .",
    "notice that with this rule the walkers visit each edge of a connected graph @xmath4 with uniform probability , so that the time series constructed from random walks on @xmath4 contain information about the distribution and correlations of the chosen node property @xmath22 throughout the network .",
    "we consider three possible choices of @xmath22 , namely the node degree , @xmath30 , the average degree of first neighbours of a node , @xmath31 , and the node clustering coefficient , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of closed triads centered on @xmath6 divided by the total possible number @xmath34 of such triads .",
    "we decided to focus on these three node properties because broad - tailed degree distributions ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , the presence of non - trivial degree correlations ( @xmath37 ) and the abundance of triangles ( @xmath38 ) are the basic features of most complex networks  @xcite .     , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and six networks , namely the us airports network  @xcite , the co - authorship network from papers published in physical review e , the budding yeast protein interaction network  @xcite , the us power grid  @xcite , a citation network in high - energy physics  @xcite and the world wide web  @xcite .",
    "the plots have been vertically displaced to enhance readability .",
    "we observe two scaling regimes , with the actual values of the two characteristic exponents @xmath41 and @xmath42 varying across different networks . the dashed blue line in each panel is the dfa of the time series of the corresponding randomized networks ( @xmath43 ) , averaged over 1000 realizations.,width=288 ]",
    "in fig .  [ fig : fig1](a ) and [ fig : fig1](b ) we respectively report the autocorrelation function ( acf ) and the power spectrum ( ps ) of the degree - based time series ( @xmath44 ) obtained in an -renyi random graph ( er ) , a scale - free graph ( sf ) constructed by the configuration model @xcite , and two real - world complex networks , namely the internet at the level of autonomous systems ( internet )  @xcite and the network of co - authorship in condensed matter ( scn )  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the acf of er and sf decays pretty fast and the corresponding ps is almost flat , indicating the absence of degree correlations .",
    "conversely , the degree - based time series obtained from real - world networks exhibit broad tails both in the acf and the in the ps , a clear indication of the presence of long - range degree correlations .",
    "the peaks at even values of @xmath45 in the acf of internet are due to the presence of disassortative degree correlations  @xcite .",
    "an iterative surrogate analysis  @xcite has also confirmed that these time series are highly non - linear . a non - parametric statistical test  @xcite , not depending on delay embedding reconstruction , suggested that such time series are non - linear or non - stationary with high confidence level .    in the following",
    "we report the results of the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa )  @xcite , a standard non - linear analysis technique which allows to detect the presence of long - range correlations and to quantify the self - affinity of a time series , even if generated by a non - stationary process . given a time series @xmath46 we consider @xmath47 time - windows of length @xmath48 ; then , we remove the local linear trend in each time - window to obtain the detrended time series @xmath49 and we compute the local variance @xmath50 of the detrended fluctuations .",
    "we evaluate the structure function @xmath51 by averaging @xmath50 over all time - windows whose length is equal to @xmath48 , and we plot @xmath51 as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "the procedure can be generalized to build a set of structure functions depending on a parameter @xmath52  @xcite , but here we focus on @xmath53 , allowing a physical interpretation of the results in term of diffusivity .",
    "if the graph @xmath4 is @xmath22-uncorrelated , i.e. if the probability to find the edge @xmath54 connecting node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 does not depend on the values @xmath16 and @xmath55 , then the fluctuations of the corresponding time series @xmath28 obtained from a random walk on @xmath4 will be indistinguishable from an uncorrelated gaussian noise , for which we have @xmath56 .",
    "conversely , a scaling behaviour @xmath57 with @xmath58 is a clear signal of the existence of @xmath22-correlations in the original graph @xmath4 , and the value of @xmath59 is a proxy for the magnitude of such correlations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) we report the results of the dfa of @xmath60 for the same four networks considered in panel ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "as expected , degree fluctuations in er and sf are compatible with gaussian noise ( @xmath61 ) , since the node degrees in these networks are uncorrelated .",
    "conversely , @xmath51 plots corresponding to time series generated by walkers on the internet and on the scn appreciably deviate from gaussian noise and are characterized by two different regimes   nodes we suggest to generate time - series of length at least equal to @xmath62 , or better @xmath63 , in order to guarantee that each edge of the graph has been traversed a sufficiently high number of times . ] . in the first regime , corresponding to small values of @xmath48 , both time series are super - diffusive , i.e. @xmath64 with @xmath65 ( @xmath66 for internet and @xmath67 for scn ) , while for large values of @xmath48 their behaviour is almost gaussian ( @xmath68 with @xmath69 for internet and @xmath70 for scn ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we report the results of the dfa of time series generated by @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 in six real - world networks of different nature  @xcite . the same two - regime behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for degree - based time series , is also found for the time series generated by @xmath39 and @xmath33 .",
    "the two scaling regimes are a signature that the networks look different , with respect to degree , degree correlations and clustering , when observed at a local or at a global scale . on the one hand ,",
    "the super - diffusive behaviour observed for small values of @xmath48 ( @xmath74 ) indicates that a walker which explores the network for relatively short time intervals will observe correlated fluctuations in the properties of the nodes it visits , a clear signal of the presence of @xmath22-correlations . on the other hand , the almost - gaussian behaviour corresponding to large values of @xmath48 ( @xmath75 ) suggests that at a larger scale ( i.e. , if the walk continues for a sufficiently long time ) , the network appears uncorrelated .",
    "the transition point @xmath76 that separates the two regimes corresponds to the typical scale of @xmath22correlations , i.e. the typical walk length above which local heterogeneities and correlations in the values of @xmath22 become less important and all the walks on the network can be considered a homogeneous representation of the typical @xmath22-fluctuations of the graph .",
    "we notice that in some cases the exponent @xmath42 can be substantially larger than @xmath77 , like in the case of the us power grid  @xcite , for which we have @xmath78 for all the three time series . in this particular case ,",
    "the super - diffusive behavior for large values of @xmath48 is due to the fact that the network is embedded in a 2d space and has a strongly self - similar structure  @xcite .",
    "although the presence of two scaling regimes seems to be a ubiquitous feature of different real - world networks , independently of their origin and nature , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] indicates that the actual values of the two exponents @xmath41 and @xmath42 may vary a lot for different node properties of the same network and , more importantly , for the same node property across different networks . in the following",
    "we show that these scaling exponents capture some key properties of a graph and can be employed to construct a taxonomy of networks  @xcite .",
    "we considered a data set of 39 medium - to - large sized ( @xmath79 to @xmath80 ) real - world networks representing different social , biological and technological systems .",
    "we assigned to each graph @xmath4 a point @xmath81 identified by the values of the six scaling exponents obtained from the dfa of time series of degree , clustering coefficient and average degree of first neighbours .",
    "then , we performed a hierarchical clustering on the resulting set of points , subsequently merging together at each step the two clusters whose points were separated by the smallest distance in @xmath82 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) we report the resulting dendrogram , where the six large clusters identified ( highlighted with different colors ) correspond to networks with different functions . from left to right : the green cluster contains all the co - authorship ( @xcite ) , trust ( pgp  @xcite ) and collaboration networks ( imdb co - starring network  @xcite ) ; the blue cluster includes spatial networks ( us power grid  @xcite and the pennsylvania road network  @xcite ) ; the bright - cyan cluster contains information networks , such as the www  @xcite , citation networks  @xcite , and email communication networks  @xcite ; the dark - cyan cluster includes online social networks  @xcite and proteomes  @xcite ; the purple cluster contains technological networks , including snapshot of the internet sampled at different times by different institutions  @xcite and the gnutella peer - to - peer file - sharing network  @xcite .",
    "finally , the networks of us airports at two different times  @xcite are put together in the yellow cluster .",
    "the accuracy of characteristic exponents in classifying networks of different nature is quite remarkable   corresponding to the scaling of @xmath51 for small values of @xmath48 .",
    "however , the resulting classification is not as neat and as clear as the one reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . ] , and becomes evident by comparing the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) with those of hierarchical clustering based on the mean and standard deviations of @xmath83 , @xmath39 and @xmath33 , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) . while in the former case clusters represent homogeneous groups of networks , in the latter case each cluster always contains networks of different nature .    the results shown in fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] suggest that the scaling exponents of the time series produced by random walkers visiting a complex network are indeed a key feature to characterize the network .",
    "hence , we name them _ characteristic exponents _ of the network ( table  [ table : table1 ] reports the characteristic exponents of all the complex networks considered in this study ) .     and @xmath39 decrease over time , while the exponents for @xmath33 remain constant . in the internet , all the characteristic exponents are constant .",
    "panel ( c ) and panel ( d ) report the detail of the dfa for degree time series , respectively for pre and internet .",
    "the plots have been vertically displaced to enhance readability , with the topmost curve corresponding to the most recent network.,width=297 ]    it is also interesting to investigate how the characteristic exponents of growing graphs change over time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) and [ fig : fig4](b ) we show the temporal evolution of the characteristic exponents of @xmath83 , @xmath39 and @xmath33 respectively for the collaboration network of authors in aps physical review e ( pre ) and for the internet .",
    "both networks have grown by a factor @xmath84 in the considered time intervals . however , while in pre the characteristic exponent @xmath41 for @xmath83 and @xmath39 exhibits a clear decrease over time , the characteristic exponents of the internet have remained constant in the considered 10-years interval .",
    "the different temporal behaviour of the characteristic exponents is probably due to the peculiar dynamics of edge formation in the two networks .",
    "in fact , in a co - authorship network a node continues to accumulate edges over time , even if the majority of these edges correspond to collaborations which are not active any more .",
    "evidently , the continuous addition of edges drives the network towards a homogenization of degree and clustering correlations .",
    "conversely , the number of neighbours of a node in the internet can not increase indefinitely , due to technological and economical constraints .",
    "in fact , connecting to more peers usually implies handling more internet traffic , which in turn requires more bandwidth and new hardware , and translates into an economical investment .",
    "these constraints are mostly independent from network size , thus having the same impact on the network growth at different times .",
    "this might explain why the structure of correlations has remained stable over time .",
    "at which the scaling of the structure function @xmath51 changes , respectively for ( a ) pre and ( b ) internet , as a function of time . despite @xmath85",
    "can slightly increase or decrease over time , its value remains of the same order of magnitude and corresponds , in both cases , to the visit of just a few hundred nodes.,width=288 ]    .the two characteristic exponents @xmath41 and @xmath42 of time series constructed from node degree ( @xmath83 ) , average degree of first neighbours ( @xmath39 ) and node clustering coefficient ( @xmath33 ) of real - world complex networks .",
    "the color correspond to the class to which a network belongs , i.e. coauthorship , collaboration and trust networks ( green ) , spatial networks ( blue ) , information and citation networks ( bright cyan ) , social networks and proteomes ( dark cyan ) , technological networks ( purple ) and air transportation networks ( yellow ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we check whether the position @xmath76 of the cut - off of the structure function does depend on the size of the graph , and to which extent . to this aim , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] the approximate value of @xmath85 for the pre and internet networks , as a function of time .",
    "notice that as the networks grow the corresponding values of @xmath85 change slightly for all the time - series , but we observe opposite trends in the two cases .",
    "in particular , @xmath85 usually decreases for pre and increases in internet .",
    "this means that @xmath85 is not simply determined by the size of the network ( otherwise we should have observed a similar behaviour in both networks ) , but is instead intimately related to the local organization of the graph .",
    "it is also worth noticing that , despite the presence of these trends , @xmath85 usually remains of the same order while both networks have grown by an order of magnitude in the considered time intervals .",
    "for instance , in the time - series of degrees of pre [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) ] @xmath85 remains in the range @xmath86 $ ] , while for the time - series of @xmath39 it is in the range @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "if we take into account the fact that a random walk on any of the snapshots of the pre collaboration network typically requires @xmath88 time - steps in order to visit all the nodes at least once , and that this network has strong communities and a high value of clustering coefficient ( and both these factors contribute to keep a walker confined on a small set of nodes ) , then we realise that @xmath89 corresponds indeed to the exploration of a relatively small region of the graph , which usually includes no more than a few hundred nodes .",
    "similarly , in the internet network [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) ] @xmath85 is in the interval @xmath90 $ ] for @xmath83 and in @xmath91 $ ] for @xmath39 and @xmath33 , which again correspond to visiting a relatively small portion of the graph .",
    "these results suggest that the values of the cut - off in the scaling of the structure functions tend to remain practically stable over time , even when the network undergoes substantial expansion .",
    "summing up , in this work we reported on the discovery of an intimate connection between the structure of a network , the properties of time - series extracted from it , and the capability of such time - series to carry useful information about the overall organization of the network .",
    "we have shown that the characteristic exponents corresponding to degree , node clustering coefficient and average degree of first neighbours can be used to cluster networks , and to distinguish social , collaboration , biological , information , transportation and spatial networks only by looking at their structure .",
    "the procedure described in this work is quite general , and can be used to extract characteristic exponents corresponding to any desired node or link property , thus allowing for a finer and more accurate classification of complex networks .",

    "the degree of the neighbours of a hub tend to be small , while the degree of the neighbours of small - degree nodes tends to be large .",
    "thus , the degrees of nodes which are at distance multiple of two tend to be positively correlated .                for each of the @xmath92 networks and for each node property we constructed @xmath93 time - series of length @xmath94 .",
