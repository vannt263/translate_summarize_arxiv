    "alkali atoms become a superfluid upon bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "the superfluid properties of the system were considered to be essentially the same as those of superfluid @xmath0he , in spite of the fact that the former is a weakly - coupled system while the latter is coupled strongly .",
    "in contrast with @xmath0he , however , alkali atoms have internal degrees of freedom attributed to the hyperfine spin @xmath1 and , accordingly , the order parameter has @xmath2 components [ 3 , 4 ] .",
    "the atoms @xmath3na and @xmath4rb have @xmath5 , for example , and their order parameters have three components , similarly to the orbital or the spin part of the superfluid @xmath6he .",
    "these degrees of freedom bring about remarkable differences between the bec of alkali atoms and that of @xmath0he .",
    "the hyperfine spin freezes along the direction of the local magnetic field when a bec is magnetically trapped .",
    "if a bec is trapped optically , on the other hand , these degrees of freedom manifest themselves and various new phenomena , such as the phase separation between the different spin states that have never been seen in superfluid @xmath0he , may be observed .",
    "it was suggested in [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] that a totally new process for formation of a vortex in a bec of alkali atoms is possible by making use of the hyperfine degrees of freedom to `` control '' the bec .",
    "suppose a bec is confined in a ioffe - pritchard trap .",
    "then a vortex state with two units of circulation can be continuously created from the vortex free superfluid state by simply reversing the axial magnetic field @xmath7 , parallel to the ioffe bars .",
    "this field is created by a set of pinch coils and can be easily controlled .",
    "four groups have already reported the formation of vortices with three independent methods [ 7 - 11 ] .",
    "our method is totally different from the previous ones in that the hyperfine spin degrees of freedom have been fully utilized .",
    "the present paper is a sequel to [ 6 ] . here",
    ", we conduct further investigations on the formation of a vortex by reversing the axial field @xmath7 .",
    "an optical plug along the axis was introduced in [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] to avoid possible majorana flips near the axis , that may take place when @xmath7 passes through zero .",
    "it is expected , however , that trap loss due to majorana flips may not be very significant if the `` dangerous point '' @xmath8 is passed fast enough and that considerable amount of the bec remains in the trap as the result .",
    "this process should not be too fast , however , such that the adiabatic condition is still satisfied .",
    "it is a very difficult task to introduce a sharply forcused optical plug along the center of the condensate whose radius is of the order of a few microns .",
    "accordingly we expect that experimental realization of our scenario will be much easier without the optical plug . in the present paper , therefore , we analyze our scenario by numerically integrating the multi - component gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we outline the order parameter and the gross - pitaevskii equation for an @xmath5 bec . in sec .",
    "iii , the gross - pitaevskii equation is integrated numerically to analyze the time dependence of the order parameter .",
    "it will be shown that merely half of the condensate is lost from the trap if the time dependence of the external magnetic field is chosen properly .",
    "iv is devoted to conclusions and discussions . in the appendix",
    ", it is shown that the formation of a vortex in the present scenario may be understood in terms of the berry phase .",
    "let us briefly summarize the order parameter and the gross - pitaevskii equation for a bec with the hyperfine spin @xmath9 to make this paper self - contained .",
    "the readers should be referred to [ 3 ] and [ 6 ] for further details .",
    "the order parameter of a bec with @xmath5 has three components @xmath10 with respect to the basis vectors @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath13 is then expanded as @xmath14 it turns out , however , that another set of basis vectors @xmath15 , defined by @xmath16 , is more convenient for certain purposes .",
    "the order parameter is now expressed as @xmath17 the transformation matrix from @xmath18 to @xmath19 is found in [ 6 ] .",
    "the most general form of the hamiltonian for @xmath5 atoms , that is rotationally invariant except for the zeeman term , is @xmath20 d^3{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the gyromagnetic ratio of the atom .",
    "the coupling constants are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 [ 12 ] .",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion derived from the above hamiltonian is @xmath26 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m } \\nabla^2-\\mu \\right ) \\psi_{a } + g_1 ( \\psi^{\\dagger}_{b } \\psi_{b } ) \\psi_{a}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + g_2 ( \\psi_{b } \\psi_{b } ) \\psi_{a}^{\\dagger } +   i \\varepsilon_{a b c } \\omega_{l c } \\psi_{b}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by taking the expectation value of the above equation in the mean - field approximation , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , we obtain @xmath29 this is the fundamental equation which we will use in the rest of this paper .",
    "suppose we confine a bec in a ioffe - pritchard trap with a quadrupole magnetic field @xmath30 and a uniform axial field @xmath31 here @xmath32 are the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the magnitude @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 near the axis @xmath35 ; @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being a constant .",
    "the system is assumed to be uniform along the @xmath38 direction for calculational simplicity .",
    "our analysis should apply to a cigar - shaped system as well .",
    "suppose we reverse the @xmath39 field slowly , while keeping @xmath40 fixed as shown in fig .",
    "it was shown in [ 5 , 6 ] that a vortex with two units of circulation will be formed if we start with a vortex - free bec . in these papers ,",
    "an optical plug was introduced along the vortex axis to prevent the atoms from escaping from the trap when @xmath41 vanishes at @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly , the order parameter remains within the weak - field seeking state ( wfss ) throughout the scenario . +    .",
    "the field @xmath7 reverses the sign in an interval of time @xmath43 , while the quadrupole field @xmath44 remains fixed .",
    "the field @xmath45 is fixed at the value @xmath46 for @xmath47 for further evolution.,width=188 ]    we suspect , however , that the bec may be stable even without the optical plug since @xmath48 vanishes only in @xmath49 at the time @xmath50 .",
    "this will be justified by solving the gross - pitaevskii equation numerically below .",
    "in contrast with the previous work , we have to take the full degrees of freedom of the order parameter into account since the energies of the three hyperfine states ( the strong - field seeking state , the weak - field seeking state and the neutral state ) are degenerate when @xmath51 .",
    "we first solve the gross - pitaevskii equation in the stationary state to find the initial order parameter configuration and the corresponding chemical potential .",
    "there is a sufficient gap between the weak - field seeking state and the other states at @xmath52 and the bec may be assumed to be purely in the weak - field seeking state .",

    "thus we conclude that a vortex can be created , even in the absence of an optical plug , by simply reversing the axial field @xmath7 .",

    "the spinor degrees of freedom have been fully utilized which renders our scheme much simpler compared with other methods .    since the vortex thus created has a higher winding number , it is metastable and eventually breaks up to two singly quantized vortices .",
