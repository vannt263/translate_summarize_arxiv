    "<S> we consider perturbations of the complex quadratic map @xmath0 and corresponding changes in their quasi - mandelbrot sets . depending on particular perturbation , visual forms of quasi - mandelbrot set changes either sharply ( when the perturbation reaches some critical value ) or continuously . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> we have a smooth transition from the classical form of the set to some forms , constructed from mostly linear structures , as it is typical for two - dimensional real number dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> two examples of continuous evolution of the quasi - mandelbrot set are described .    </S>",
    "<S> complex dynamics is a well - known source of beautiful images which bring this branch of pure mathematics into attention of wide groups of non - mathematicians , and provide interesting connections between math and art ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the situation with real two - dimensional dynamics is more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> there are many examples of artistic interest ( @xcite ) , however , they may be considered as an `` island '' in a wide `` sea '' of other systems without any esthetic value .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also remarkable that visual patterns given by complex and real dynamics are quite different . </S>",
    "<S> mostly based on round structures , typical julia sets of complex maps are sometimes compared with `` baroque architecture '' , while analogs of julia sets and basins of attraction in the case of real maps usually consist of quasi - parallel bands , long tongues , and other linear structures .    </S>",
    "<S> however , from the mathematical viewpoint one - dimensional complex- and two - dimensional real maps are not completely different entities : each 1-dim complex map can be considered as 2-dim real map by , for example , separating real and imaginary parts . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the simplest nonlinear complex map ( and the most famous one ) @xmath1 is equivalent to a real map @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the real and imaginary parts of complex parameter @xmath6 .    in general complex analytic maps </S>",
    "<S> form a particular subset of two - dimensional real maps which satisfy the cauchy - riemann conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of our study is to understand what happens in a zone located in some sense `` near '' this subset . </S>",
    "<S> we consider one - parameter family of maps having a complex analytic structure for a particular value of the parameter , and then study properties of the map when the parameter is close , but is not equal to this particular value . </S>",
    "<S> pure mathematical aspects of this problem have been studied in a number of papers @xcite , though a general picture is still far from being well understood . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we address more informal question of visual appearance of sets created by such maps , and try to see a transition from pure complex visual forms to those typical to a real dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the quadratic map ( 1 ) . instead of fixing @xmath6 to consider a sequence of corresponding julia sets we have chosen the mandelbrot set as the pattern to perturb . </S>",
    "<S> there are two reason for this . </S>",
    "<S> one is technical simplicity of this set to calculate , the second is the wide - spread popularity of the mandelbrot set and its role in bringing mathematical achievements to a more general public .    </S>",
    "<S> there two definition of the mandelbrot set which are equivalent for complex analytic maps . </S>",
    "<S> first , in is the set of @xmath6 for which the julia set of the map ( 1 ) is connected . </S>",
    "<S> second , it is the set of @xmath6 for which the orbit of the zero - point of the map ( 1 ) does not escape to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> we take the second definition to calculate the ( quasi)-mandelbrot set for real maps , using the name `` connectedness locus '' for the set created according to the first definition . </S>",
    "<S> we leave studies of the connectedness loci as well as julia sets for real perturbations of complex maps for a future work .    </S>",
    "<S> to start our investigations we should fix the perturbations imposed on the quadratic map . </S>",
    "<S> some maps do not show continuous transitions to visual patterns of real dynamics , as it can be seen by close look on the map @xmath7 @xmath8 studied in @xcite . for @xmath9 this system is equivalent to the map ( 1 ) with the following redefinition of variables : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . in order to understand what happens for other values of the parameter @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> we remind a reader some simple facts from general theory of two - dimensional real algebras ( see , for example , @xcite ) . to define a particular algebra of this type </S>",
    "<S> it is enough to fix the square of imaginary unit : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real numbers . </S>",
    "<S> there are three qualitatively different possibilities :    * if @xmath18 the resulting algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of complex numbers with the imaginary unit @xmath19 , and the isomorphism has the form @xmath20 . * </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath21 the resulting algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of dual numbers with the condition @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> * if @xmath23 the resulting algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of perplex numbers with the condition @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> sometimes the perplex numbers are called as double numbers , split - complex numbers or hyperbolic numbers ( in the latter case two other number systems are correspondingly elliptic and parabolic numbers ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the map ( 4 - 5 ) is specially constructed so that it coincides with the initial quadratic map ( 1 ) for perturbed two - dimensional algebra . if @xmath25 this algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of complex numbers , and the mandelbrot set for the map ( 4 - 5 ) is nothing else but the `` classical '' mandelbrot set transformed according to corresponding linear transformation . for @xmath26 an abrupt transition occurs , and we obtain and infinite band  an analog of the mandelbrot set for dual numbers . for smaller @xmath6 the result is a rectangular representing this set for the algebra of perplex numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the abrupt nature of transition for @xmath26 makes the map ( 4 - 5 ) useless for our present study .    </S>",
    "<S> the map ( 4 - 5 ) represents a rather peculiar example , and the other known map , studied by peckhman in @xcite gives us a success . </S>",
    "<S> this map conserves the meaning of @xmath27 as a complex variable with real part @xmath28 and imaginary part @xmath29 , however , it violates the cauchy - riemann conditions by adding a linear term depending on @xmath30-conjugate : @xmath31 or , in real variables @xmath32 @xmath33    in figs . 1  6 we present several pictures of a part of quasi - mandelbrot set boundary in the lower - right quadrant for @xmath16 from @xmath34 to @xmath35 with the step equal to @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see clearly how the deviation from the famous structure of the mandelbrot set , touching the set at it outer range for @xmath36 , then goes deep inside and transform it into the structure typical for real maps . </S>",
    "<S> at @xmath37 almost all structure remaining from complex origin of the map under investigation is washed out .    </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively similar patterns appear for negative @xmath16 in the same range of @xmath38 , so we do not present corresponding pictures here .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 : a part of the `` original '' mandelbrot set boundary with no perturbation .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 : a fragment of quasi - mandelbrot set boundary with @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion have touched an outer part of a bulb .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 : the same boundary for @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> linear structures have been formed in the outer part of the bulb .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 : the same boundary for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the bulb have been almost completely destroyed .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 5 : the same boundary for @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> only remnants of the non - perturbed structures are visible .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 6 : the same boundary for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> almost all complex analytic structure have been washed out .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider a family of maps which , to our knowledge , is not studied previously . </S>",
    "<S> it is possibly the simplest way to disturb the map ( 2 - 3 ) , though from the viewpoint of complex dynamics it looks crazy . </S>",
    "<S> this map has the form @xmath42 @xmath43 and represents a complex analytic map for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the first equation of the real decomposition of the complex quadratic map ( 2 ) remains unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with an auxiliary map which has the same equation ( 9 ) for the @xmath28-component and represent the quadratic map for a disturbed algebra with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it has the following equation for @xmath29 @xmath46    the properties of the map ( 9,11 ) is similar to those for ( 4,5 ) , and the algebra becomes isomorphic to perplex numbers for @xmath47 showing a sharp change of its quasi - mandelbrot set for @xmath48 . on the other side , positive @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> keep the considered algebra within the class of complex numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the map ( 9,10 ) is not equivalent to ( 9,11 ) , though , as the fate of a particular trajectory is typically determined by its behavior at the range of variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the order of unity , we may expect that it should be a remarkable change of dynamics for @xmath49 being somewhere in the interval @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical experiment confirms these considerations . </S>",
    "<S> we find qualitative changes in the shape of the quasi - mandelbrot set for @xmath49 less than unity . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 7  10 some of `` snapshots '' of the boundary are presented . at the final picture created for @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> we can see a typical pattern of a real number dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is also remarkable that unlike previous case of the map ( 6 ) , the real - like features of the map(9,10 ) do not propagate from the outer part of the set , but steadily develop in the whole range of the boundary structure , which becomes more and more elongated with decreasing @xmath49 .    on the other hand , for @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> the change is rather slow and not so interesting from the viewpoint of visual impression . </S>",
    "<S> even for @xmath53 some structure remaining from the original mandelbrot set still survives , though linear structures are well developed for this value of @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 7 : a part of quasi - mandelbrot set boundary for the map ( 9 )  ( 10 ) with @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the whole structure is slightly disturbed .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 8 : the same boundary for @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> bulbs have been deformed , but not destroyed .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 9 : the same boundary for @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> bulbs have been deformed into quasi - linear structures .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 10 : the same boundary for @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> bulbs became elements of linear structures .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present paper we have studied visual appearance of quasi - mandelbrot sets for perturbed quadratic complex map . </S>",
    "<S> two different cases can be distinguished . in a particular case when a perturbed map is equivalent to the initial one for a perturbed two - dimensional real algebra , the form of the quasi - mandelbrot set change sharply reflecting change in the isomorphic class of the algebra . </S>",
    "<S> for general perturbations , however , we expect a smooth transition from complex to real visual patterns . </S>",
    "<S> two studied in the present paper maps show this transition clearly .    our present work can be pushed further in several ways </S>",
    "<S> . continuous nature of transition can be used in constructing `` movies '' showing how one fractal structure is replaced by another , which may make the beauty of fractals dynamical . </S>",
    "<S> another possible application of the transition range of parameters found in the present paper is creation of generalized julia sets , which can provide interesting changes in their visual patterns . </S>",
    "<S> other possible directions include non - polynomial perturbations of complex analytical maps which have already been studied in mathematical literature @xcite . </S>"
