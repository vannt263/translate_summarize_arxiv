    "ss433 has been discovered as a source of strong h@xmath3 lines , and as a variable radio and x - ray source @xcite .",
    "it is an x - ray binary with a @xmath4 days period , producing bipolar relativistic ( 0.26c ) jets undergoing a precession movement in so covering a cone with an opening angle of 19.8@xmath5 and an axis of @xmath6 with the line of sight .",
    "this precession has indeed been observed in radio , at arcsec @xcite and milliarcsec scales @xcite .",
    "so ss433 was actually the first microquasar discovered . in spite of intensive studies",
    ", no line has been associated to the companion star yet .",
    "it is generally accepted but has never been proved that ss433 is a neutron star + massive star binary system .",
    "ss433 has been observed with isophot , in the spectral mode at 2.5 - 5 @xmath0 m ( @xmath70.04@xmath0 m resolution ) and 6 - 12 @xmath0 m ( @xmath70.1@xmath0 m resolution ) , and in the photometric mode at 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath0 m , in november 1996 and april 1997 .",
    "we looked for wolf - rayet ( wr ) star observations in the iso archives , as it was the suspected type for ss433 companion star .",
    "several wrs were observed with isosws , and so we rebined the sws spectra to the spectral resolution of isophot . + as a lot of hydrogen is seen in ss433 optical spectra , we chose to compare it to wrs of nitrogen type ( wn ) which are in the first stage of wr evolution . figure  [ figwr ] ( left ) shows the observed spectra of the four corresponding wrs , classified from the not very evolved ( late type wnl ) to the evolved ( early type wne ) ones : wr147 @xmath8 wn8+b0.5 ( wnl ) , wr78 @xmath8 wn7h ( wnl ) , wr136 @xmath8 wn6b ( wne ) and wr134 @xmath8 wn6 ( wne ) . comparing on figure  1 these spectra to the one of ss433 ,",
    "it is clear that ss433 is closest to wr147 , a late type wr .",
    "figure  [ figwr ] ( right ) also shows the comparison of wr147 spectrum with that of ss433 taken at different phases . ss433 and wr147 spectra were dereddened with a@xmath9 = 8 and 11.2 mag respectively , using the lutz et al .",
    "@xcite law .",
    "the lines , identified according to@xcite , are strong and weak h+hei blended lines ( because of isophot spectral resolution ) and weak heii lines .",
    "no metallic line was observed .",
    "the ss433 line spectrum is clearly wr - like .",
    "we note that wr147 is known as a colliding wind binary system which may explain its resemblance to ss433 .",
    "+      figure  [ figcont ] shows the continuum spectra of ss433 , which flux density ( f@xmath10 ) is well fitted by power laws in the 2 - 12 @xmath0 m range , corresponding to free - free emission : optically thin for f@xmath11 , and in the intermediate regime between optically thin and thick for f@xmath12 . in far - ir , an additional component , as a black - body due to dust surrounding the system ,",
    "is needed .",
    "the 0.6 spectral index is characteristic of an ionized homogeneous wind with a spherical expansion at a constant velocity @xcite , although it is also valid for a more complex geometry as long as it stays thick @xcite .",
    "so ss433 continuum spectrum corresponds to the one emitted by a standard o or wr wind .",
    "+      we calculated the mass loss rate of this free - free emitting wind , following the wright & barlow@xcite formula(8 ) . with a distance d=3.5kpc , a gaunt factor g@xmath71 , a flux at 4@xmath0 m ( @xmath13hz ) , and for a wn - type wind where the mean atomic weight per nucleon @xmath14 , the number of free electrons per nucleon @xmath15 , the mean ionic charge z=1 and the velocity @xmath16km.s@xmath2 , we find : m @xmath17 m@xmath18.yr@xmath2 .",
    "however , the recent wn mass - loss rate estimates @xcite show that this value has to be lowered by a factor 2 or 3 due to clumping in the wind .",
    "this is in good agreement with the mass transfer rate estimated by van den heuvel et al.@xcite assuming a normal homogeneous wr wind , or with the recent mass transfer values obtained from simulations of ss433 evolution by king et al.@xcite . for wr147 ,",
    "m @xmath19 m@xmath18.yr@xmath2 and the wn mean is so our @xmath20 m@xmath18.yr@xmath2 mass loss evaluation for ss433 is compatible with a strong wnl wind .",
    "+    what happens to the material contained in this wind is unknown since only is ejected into the jets @xcite .",
    "it may be accreted then ejected via the l@xmath21 point @xcite , or close to the compact object @xcite .",
    "it may then form dust seen in far - ir at a distance @xmath22a.u .",
    "this material is probably responsible for the equatorial outflows observed with the vlba @xcite@xcite at @xmath23a.u . from ss433 .",
    "cygnusx-3 is a microquasar for which wr - like features have been detected in near - ir spectra @xcite@xcite .",
    "we also observed it with isophot - s during its quiescent state , but with much more difficulties as it is a weak ir source .",
    "its spectrum was also compared to the four wr spectra as shown in figure  [ figcygx3 ] .",
    "only one line was found in cygnusx-3 spectrum , at 4.3@xmath0 m with a confidence level of more than 4.3@xmath24 , corresponding to an hei line only visible in wr147 spectrum .",
    "+    the spectral fitting of cygnusx-3 dereddened ( a@xmath9=20mag ) spectra is obtained with a unique power law f@xmath10@xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 in the 2.4 - 12@xmath0 m range when dereddened with the lutz et al.@xcite law ( figure[figcont ] upper right ) , and with the sum of a power law with slope @xmath26@xmath28 and a black body , a hint for the presence of circumstellar dust , when using the draine law@xcite ( figure[figcont ] lower right ) .",
    "we can not choose between these two laws since the molecular composition of the absorbing material on the line of sight to cygnusx-3 is unknown .",
    "as for ss433 , the power law part of the continuum spectrum can be explained by free - free emission of an expanding wind in the intermediate case between optically thick and optically thin regimes .",
    "the corresponding mass loss evaluation , with 63mjy at 6.75@xmath0 m and @xmath29=1500km.s@xmath2@xcite , gives m @xmath30m@xmath18.yr@xmath2 .",
    "we conclude @xcite that our results are consistent with a wolf - rayet companion to the compact object in cygnusx-3 of wn8 type , a later type than suggested by previous works @xcite@xcite .",
    "ss433 shows a wn8-like spectrum , which continuum is due to free - free emission corresponding to a standard o or wr wind or a geometrically complex thick wind .",
    "the inferred mass loss of @xmath20 m@xmath18.yr@xmath2 is compatible with a wnl wind .",
    "so either ss433 is the second wolf - rayet x - ray binary known in our galaxy after cygnus x-3 , or it shows wr - like conditions , and at that point we can not distinguish between these two cases .",
