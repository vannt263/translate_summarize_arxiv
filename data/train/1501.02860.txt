[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in order to describe a method that allows us to construct a zero - separating surface for @xmath13 , let us revisit the construction of a zero - separating surface for @xmath14 in the previous section , to emphasize some key ideas .",
    "if we look again at fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we can interpret it as follows . on the left - side boundary of the domain",
    "@xmath15 we had two types of curve patches , i.e. , the _ 1d - flat patches _ shown in fig .  [ fig:4 ] . the proximity of the vertices impose that these curve patches are straight line segments . ] , and the _ 0d - flat patches _ shown in fig .",
    ". some of these patches may actually be flat ( i.e. , straight line segments ) , but there is nothing in our construction that requires them to be flat . ] .",
    "then , if the 1d - flat patches are short enough , and if the whole left - side boundary curve is faithful , then the construction described in the previous section is possible .",
    "we can think of this construction systematically as follows .",
    "for each 1d - flat patch we have constructed a _ polygonal line of 1d - flat patches _ , then builds a surface patch by advancing along straight parallel lines until we reach another curve @xmath16 at the intersection with some surface , then builds another surface patch by advancing along another set of straight parallel lines , and so on .",
    "] , which is the image through the function @xmath17 of the corresponding shaded layer in the partition of @xmath15 shown in fig .  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "similarly , for each 0d - flat patch we have constructed a _ polygonal line of 0d - flat patches_. for both types of polygonal lines of patches the construction is similar : the patches are continued from left to right in the attracting direction of a surface represented by a solid line segment , and they  turn \" in a different direction along the surface represented by a dotted line segment .    a key property that makes this construction work is the fact that the two different types of polygonal lines of patches match perfectly along their common boundaries . on the other hand , we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] that the polygonal line of 0d - flat patches  turns \" ( i.e. , encounters dotted lines ) more times than the polygonal line of 1d - flat patches .",
    "the reason their boundaries still match is the following : even though the polygonal line of 1d - flat patches does not turn as many times ( e.g. , does not turn in the neighborhoods of points where solid lines intersect ) , its _ boundary curves _ do turn .",
    "note that all we needed in the previous section in order to construct the polygonal lines of patches described above were the two different kinds of dotted lines .",
    "one way to think about our choice of a configuration of dotted lines as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] is the following .",
    "we can first choose  midpoints \" for all the horizontal solid line segments , and decide that the thick dotted lines will pass through these midpoints .",
    "once we have the thick dotted lines , we can also construct the intersections between them and the thin horizontal dotted lines .",
    "these intersection points are important , since the only other remaining dotted lines ( the non - horizontal ones ) pass through these points .",
    "we can construct these lines for example by connecting the intersection points with the triangle vertex that lies on the opposite side .",
    "we now construct a zero - separating surface for @xmath13 based on the idea of polygonal lines of patches .",
    "we need to describe  dotted surfaces \" ( i.e. , surfaces that sub - partition @xmath18 , and play the role that the dotted lines have played for sub - partitioning @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) for the tetrahedral partition of the three - dimensional domain @xmath18 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tunnels_4d ] and fig .  [ fig:19.5 ] .",
    "we construct the dotted surfaces as follows .",
    "first , like in the 3d case , we choose _ midpoints _ for all the horizontal line segments in the tetrahedral subdivision of @xmath18 . for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig:19.5 ] ( where we show just two representative tunnels within @xmath18 ) there will be one such midpoint on each line segment along the six horizontal half - lines shown there .",
    "note that , in order to make this figure more clear , we have omitted many other tetrahedra that are also inside these same two tunnels ( since , according to our construction , @xmath18 is partitioned by tunnels , and each tunnel is partitioned by tetrahedra ) .",
    "then , once we have the midpoints , we also construct _ mid - curves _ along the @xmath19-direction tetrahedral faces - direction tetrahedral faces are faces that contain the direction of the @xmath19-axis .",
    "each tetrahedron contains exactly two such faces , and they are adjacent to a common horizontal edge , so they both have an adjacent midpoint that we constructed previously .",
    "the other two faces are called _ back face _ and _ front face _ , as seen in the direction of the construction , i.e , in the @xmath19-direction . the back face and the front face intersect in an edge which is called the _ hinge edge _ of the tetrahedron . ] .",
    "each mid - curve connects a point on the boundary of its adjacent _ midpoint turning patch_-direction tetrahedral face intersects exactly one midpoint turning patch . ] with the opposite vertex of the @xmath19-direction tetrahedral face that contains the mid - curve .",
    "once we have specified the midpoints and the mid - curves as described above , there is a unique way to build the polygonal lines of 2d - flat patches and the polygonal lines of 1d - flat patches .",
    "finally , we construct a _ mid - surface _ within each tetrahedron , and it gives us a unique way to build the polygonal lines of 0d - flat patches , and therefore finish the construction of a zero - separating surface for the toric differential inclusion @xmath13 .    as a final remark , let us also notice that there is another way to describe the above construction , as follows .",
    "for each tetrahedron in the subdivision of @xmath18 , we choose a midpoint of its _ advance edge_-axis ) .",
    "] and then construct two  dotted lines \" that start at this midpoint and go into the two faces of the tetrahedron that contain the advance edge . then the  dotted surface \" of the tetrahedron",
    "is a triangular surface   that partitions the tetrahedron into two parts .",
    "two edges of the dotted surface are the dotted lines we mentioned above , and the third edge is the hinge edge of the tetrahedron .",
    "the dotted surface fills in the space in between its three edges according to the following rules : @xmath20 the _ midpoint _ must be contained in the _ midpoint turning patch _ of the polygonal lines of 2d - flat patches , and the part of the midpoint turning patch that is contained in this tetrahedron must be contained in the dotted surface , @xmath21 the _ mid - curve _ must be contained in the _ mid - curve turning patch _ of the polygonal lines of 1d - flat patches , and the part of the mid - curve turning patch that is contained in this tetrahedron must be contained in the dotted surface , and @xmath22 the dotted surface is  vertical enough \" , in the sense that approximately horizontal line segments intersect it in at most one point .",
    "condition @xmath20 is trivial to enforce . to enforce condition",
    "@xmath21 we have to make sure that we do not allow the two mid - curve turning patches to intersect near the hinge edge . finally , notice that ( by moving the construction of the zero - separating surface close enough to the origin ) we can assume that the turning patches as as thin as we wish , so the fitted surface is as close to the half - distance triangle between the back face and the front face",
    ". therefore condition @xmath22 can also be satisfied .",
    "our next focus will be to construct a _",
    "zero - separating surface , in the next section . ] for the 4d toric differential inclusion @xmath13 .",
    "recall that we have constructed a faithful zero - separating surface for the 3d toric differential inclusion @xmath14 in the previous section , essentially by building a slightly smaller triangle inside each triangle of the subdivision of @xmath15 , in a special way that makes all of the vertices of these smaller triangles align with each - other along turning patches and along some attracting directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:19.5 ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , although this simple approach worked well in @xmath23 , _ it fails to work_. ] in @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we need a new way of constructing a _ faithful _ zero - separating surface for @xmath13 , which will also generalize to higher dimensions .    a method that accomplishes this is the following .",
    "after we have subdivided the domain @xmath18 of @xmath13 into tetrahedra , we _ further subdivide _ each tetrahedron by choosing several points along its advance edge and connecting them with its hinge edge , and making sure that the first such point is very close to the back face , the last such point is very close to the front face , and there is at least one more point between them .",
    "denote this new polygonal fan by @xmath25 , and its associated toric differential inclusion by @xmath26 , and consider a zero - separating surface for @xmath26 constructed close enough to the origin .",
    "then , for each tetrahedron of @xmath13 , the normals to this zero - separating surface for @xmath26 at points that are not in any uncertainty region of @xmath13 belongs to the _ interior _ of the attracting cone of that tetrahedron of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , this zero - separating surface for @xmath26 is a _ faithful _ zero - separating surface for @xmath13 .",
    "the constructions we have described in the previous sections can be carried on analogously in higher dimensions . to build a zero - separating surface for an @xmath27-dimensional toric differential inclusion @xmath28",
    ", we first subdivide the simplicial domain @xmath29 into @xmath27 !",
    "subdomains given by specific orderings of the logarithmic coordinates @xmath30",
    ". then we take the representative subdomain @xmath31 and map it to the unbounded simplicial domain @xmath32",
    ".    then we subdivide @xmath33 into @xmath34-dimensional simplices ( similar to our decomposition of @xmath15 into triangles and of @xmath18 into tetrahedra ) and assume that we have already constructed a  left - side boundary condition \" for a zero separating surface on @xmath33 into half - lines in the direction of the @xmath35-axis , then the  left - side boundary \" of @xmath33 is the set of boundary points of these half - lines .",
    "the left - side boundary of @xmath33 is essentially a copy of @xmath36 , and the zero - separating surface constructed along it is based on previously constructed _ faithful _",
    "zero - separating surface for a @xmath34-dimensional toric differential inclusion . ] .",
    "the simplices of @xmath33 can be organized along  tunnels \" that start at simplices on the left - side boundary of @xmath33 and go in the @xmath35-direction .",
    "this provides a lexicographic - type _ ordering _ of all the simplices of @xmath33 , based on the ordering of simplices of @xmath36 and the order of increasing @xmath35 values in simplices within the same tunnel in @xmath33 .",
    "then , we build a zero - separating surface for @xmath28 by constructing one piece of the surface for each simplex of @xmath33 , in the order described above .",
    "the construction is based on _ polygonal lines of patches _ , like in the previous section .",
    "the turning sets for the polygonal lines of patches are given by a ",
    "dotted surface \" constructed like in the previous section : for each simplex of @xmath33 , we first choose a midpoint of its advance edge , then we construct boundary patches of the dotted surface on all the facets - dimensional case ] of the simplex that contain the advance edge , and then connect these boundary patches with the codimension - two face that is opposite the advance edge .",
    "finally , we can also obtain _ faithful _ zero - separating surfaces for @xmath37 , by subdividing each simplex of @xmath33 into several simplices , given by a choice of at least three points along the advance edge of the simplex , as explained in the previous section .",

    "@xmath39 in @xmath40 , and fix some @xmath41 . from the work of horn and jackson",
    "@xcite we know that @xmath39 has a globally defined strict lyapunov function within any linear invariant subspace .",
