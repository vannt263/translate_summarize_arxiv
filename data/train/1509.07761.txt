    "the lexicon was constructed from over 1.6 million tweets in 13 european languages , annotated for sentiment by human annotators . in the corpus ,",
    "probably the largest set of manually annotated tweets , 4% of the tweets contained emojis .",

    ", the use of emoticons had spread , and the set of emoticons was extended with hugs and kisses , by using characters found on a typical keyboard .",
    "a decade later , emoticons had found their way into everyday digital communications and have now become a paralanguage of the web @xcite .",
    "the word ` emoji ' literally means ` picture character ' in japanese .",
    "emojis emerged in japan at the end of the 20@xmath0 century to facilitate digital communication . a number of japanese carriers ( softbank , kddi , docomo ) provided their own implementations , with incompatible encoding schemes .",
    "emojis were first standardized in unicode 6.0 @xcite  the core emoji set consisted of 722 characters .",
    "however , apple s support for emojis on the iphone , in 2010 , led to global popularity .",

    "the growing importance of sentiment analysis coincides with the growth of social media , such as twitter , facebook , book reviews , forum discussions , blogs , etc .",

    "sentiwordnet extends the well - known wordnet @xcite by associating each synset with three numerical scores , describing how ` objective ' , ` positive ' , and ` negative ' the terms in the synset are .",
    "emoticons have proved crucial in the automated sentiment classification of informal texts @xcite . in an early work @xcite , a basic distinction between positive and negative emoticons",
    "was used to automatically generate positive and negative samples of texts .",

    "the sentiment of emojis is computed from the sentiment of tweets .",
    "a large pool of tweets , in 13 european languages , was labeled for sentiment by 83 native speakers .",
    "sentiment labels can take one of three ordered values : _ negative _ @xmath1 _ neutral _ @xmath1 _ positive_. a sentiment label , @xmath2 , is formally a discrete , 3-valued variable @xmath3 .",
    "an emoji is assigned a sentiment from all the tweets in which it occurs .",
    "first , for each emoji , we form a discrete probability distribution ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the sentiment score @xmath7 of the emoji is then computed as the mean of the distribution .",
    "the components of the distribution , i.e. , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denote the negativity , neutrality , and positivity of the emoji , respectively . the probability @xmath8 is estimated from the number of occurrences , @xmath9 , of the emoji in tweets with the label @xmath2 .",
    "note that an emoji can occur multiple times in a single tweet , and we count all the occurrences .",
    "a more detailed formalization of the sentiment representation can be found in the methods section .",

    "we successively shorten our list of emojis by cutting off the least - frequent emojis .",
    "the results for two thresholds , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with the highest correlation coefficients , are shown in table  [ tab : emojitracker ] .",
    "both correlation coefficients are high , significant at the 1% level , thus confirming that our list of emojis is indeed representative of their general use on twitter . between the two options",
    ", we decided to select the list of emojis with at least @xmath12 occurrences , resulting in the lexicon of 751 emojis .",

    "a common , and the simplest , measure of the performance of the model is @xmath13 , which measures the agreement between the model and the test data . here , we use the same measure to estimate the agreement between the pairs of annotators .",
    "@xmath13 is defined in terms of the observed disagreement @xmath14 : @xmath15 @xmath13 is simply the fraction of the diagonal elements of the coincidence matrix .",
    "note that it does not account for the ( dis)agreement by chance , nor for the ordering between the sentiment values .",
    "another , more sophisticated measure of performance , specifically designed for 3-class sentiment classifiers @xcite , is @xmath16(@xmath17 ) : @xmath18 @xmath16(@xmath17 ) implicitly takes into account the ordering of the sentiment values by considering only the _ negative _ @xmath19 and _ positive _ @xmath20 labels , and ignoring the middle , _ neutral _ label . in general , @xmath21 ( known as the f - score ) is a harmonic mean of precision and recall for class @xmath2 . in the case of a coincidence matrix , which is symmetric ,",
    "the ` precision ' and ` recall ' are equal , and thus @xmath21 degenerates into : @xmath22 in terms of the annotator agreement , @xmath21 is the fraction of equally labeled tweets out of all the tweets with label @xmath2 .",
