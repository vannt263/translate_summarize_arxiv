    "the spin hall effect ( she ) has been attracting a great deal of interest due to its fundamental as well as technological importance . the intrinsic she originates from the berry phase of the multiband bloch function , so that the spin hall conductivity ( shc ) takes a material - specific value that is independent of impurity scattering in the low resistivity regime @xcite . in transition metals ,",
    "the intrinsic shc takes a considerably large value @xcite , because of the  effective aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phase \" induced by @xmath6-orbital degrees of freedom and the atomic spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) @xcite .",
    "intrinsic she in sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 had been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the @xmath9 tight - binding model . by the same mechanism , she in transition metals had been studied based on the realistic multiorbital tight - binding model in ref . @xcite and the first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "the obtained shcs agree well with recent experimental observations , in both the magnitude and sign @xcite .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic mechanism , she is also induced by impurity scattering with the aid of soi ; this phenomenon is known as the extrinsic she @xcite .",
    "it consists of a skew scattering term ( @xmath10 ) and a side jump term ( @xmath11 ) ; this fact suggests that considerable large shc can be realized due to the skew scattering term in the very low resistivity metals , beyond the material - specific intrinsic shc .",
    "for this reason , study of the extrinsic she is significant for realizing excellent spintronics device to produce or detect the spin current .",
    "the extrinsic she due to nonmagnetic impurities or vacancies had been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , by developing the theory of the extrinsic anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) @xcite .",
    "the obtained shc is , however , very small unless the enhancement factor for the soi due to the multiband effect is taken into consideration .",
    "for this reason , it is not easy to estimate the magnitudes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 due to nonmagnetic impurities . in transition metals",
    ", there is no apparent experimental evidence for a large extrinsic she due to natural randomness .",
    "dilute magnetic impurities such as fe and ce have been found to induce a large extrinsic ahe in simple metals @xcite .",
    "the hall angles in aufe @xcite and rare - earth doped metals @xcite reach 0.01@xmath140.001 under high magnetic fields .",
    "since the she has a similar mechanism to that of the ahe , one might expect that a giant she can be realized by magnetic impurities .",
    "however , theoretical analysis of the extrinsic she in a simple @xmath15-electron metal due to magnetic impurities has not been performed previously .    in this paper , we study the extrinsic she based on a single - impurity anderson model for ce and yb atoms , both of which are typical magnetic impurities .",
    "nonperturbative effect of the large soi for @xmath16-electrons ( @xmath17 k ) is correctly accounted for .",
    "due to skew scattering , the obtained spin hall angle @xmath18 , which is the ratio between the transverse spin hall current and the longitudinal electric current , exceeds @xmath19 for @xmath5{$\\;\\stackrel{>}{\\sim}\\;$}}0.03 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the phase shift for @xmath3 partial wave ; it is more than 10 times greater than that in nonmagnetic metals such as pt @xcite .",
    "since the spin hall angle represents the efficiency of the creating spin current , giant spin hall current is expected to emerge in simple metals by introducing dilute magnetic impurities .",
    "moreover , the extrinsic shc can take a large value well above the kondo temperature @xmath20 , in contrast to the anomalous hall conductivity ( ahc ) .",
    "the origin of the giant she is found to be the large soi and angular momentum in the rare - earth impurities , which had not been treated appropriately in previous studies of the extrinsic she .",
    "in this study , we use the single - impurity anderson model for ce and yb atoms . in a ce@xmath21 ion with a @xmath22 configuration ,",
    "the @xmath23 level is about 3000 k higher than the @xmath24 level due to the strong atomic soi @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider only @xmath24 states for the ce - impurity . in the same way",
    ", we consider only @xmath23 states in yb@xmath21 ion with @xmath25 configuration . here",
    ", we introduce the following single - impurity anderson model for ce@xmath26yb atoms with both @xmath6- and @xmath16-orbitals @xcite : @xmath27 where we have employed the electron ( hole ) picture for the ce ( yb ) impurity .",
