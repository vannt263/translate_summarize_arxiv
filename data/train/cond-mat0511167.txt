    "the freezing of a disordered fluid into an ordered crystalline solid undoubtedly represents one of the most spectacular examples of thermodynamics in action . but despite its ubiquity and familiarity , key aspects of the phenomenon remain poorly understood across a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "principal among the reasons for this is the difficulty of obtaining accurate simulation estimates for fluid - solid phase coexistence properties . in this section",
    "we outline the most commonly used contemporary approaches for tracing freezing boundaries , identify their key strengths and weaknesses , and highlight recent developments in the search for improvements .",
    "the staple method for locating fluid - solid coexistence is thermodynamic integration ( ti ) @xcite . here , the free energy of each phase ( fluid ( f ) and crystalline solid ( cs ) ) is computed for states covering a range of densities , using integration methods which connect their thermodynamic properties with those of reference states of known free energy .",
    "the two branches of the free - energy are then matched to determine the freezing parameters . while there is much to commend ti ( principally its simplicity ) it turns out to be less than ideal in a number of respects @xcite .",
    "these have been documented in detail elsewhere ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) ; but briefly , the main difficulty is one of identifying a suitable reference state together with a reversible phase space pathway by which it can be reached ; a poor choice of integration path may encounter singularities both real and artificial @xcite which compromise the calculation .",
    "additionally , corrections may be required to allow for the fact that the path does not quite reach the idealized reference state @xcite . moreover , the method focuses on the absolute free energies of the phases @xcite , rather than the quantity of interest their free energy _",
    "difference_. finally , there currently exists no reliable and comprehensive method for estimating errors on phase boundaries computed via ti .",
    "obtaining a whole f - cs phase boundary using ti is a computationally challenging task .",
    "however , knowledge of one point on the f - cs coexistence boundary ( obtained , for instance , by using ti ) can be used to bootstrap a gibbs - duhem integration ( gdi ) scheme to trace the entire curve without further calculation of free energies . the gdi method @xcite exploits the generalized clausius - clapeyron equation to express the slope of the phase boundary entirely in terms of single - phase averages .",
    "this is clearly a virtue since it avoids the need for two - phase sampling .",
    "however , _ without _ any ` reconnection ' of the two configuration - spaces at subsequent simulation state points , the gdi approach offers no feedback on integration errors . since there",
    "will generally exist a _",
    "band _ of metastable states on each side of the phase boundary , it is possible for the integration to wander significantly from the true boundary with no indication that anything is wrong . as a result , the calculation of meaningful uncertainties is problematic .",
    "gdi has been used in a number of studies , most notably in the context of freezing of hard and soft spheres @xcite .",
    "more recently , attention has shifted to developing methods for tackling the problem of locating f - cs coexistence via _ direct _ measurements of free energy differences .",
    "to do so , one must construct a reversible sampling path between the phases .",
    "the obvious `` physical '' path , traversing the region where both phases coexist whilst practicable when the two phases share the same symmetry ( see eg . ref .",
    "@xcite ) turns out to be computationally problematic in the f - cs context .",
    "the main reasons for this are the large degree of metastability of the two phases , the extended timescale for the crystallization process , and the tendency of any crystal formed to exhibit vacancies , interstitials and other defects .",
    "accordingly , recent effort has focussed on trying to identify alternative inter - phase routes for the f - cs problem .",
    "one such alternative route , called constrained fluid-@xmath0 integration has been proposed by grochla@xcite and extended by elke et al @xcite .",
    "it involves the controlled transformation of the fluid phase to the solid phase in a series of stages . during the initial stage the fluid",
    "is gradually changed to a weakly interacting fluid by reducing the strength of interparticle interactions . at the next stage , a set of gaussian potential wells of prescribed width",
    "are switched on at the sites of a crystalline lattice of the appropriate symmetry .",
    "simultaneously , the volume of the system is gradually changed from a value typical of the fluid to one typical of the solid .",
    "the particles of the weakly interacting fluid are then allowed to diffuse to the lattice sites , where they are captured by the gaussian wells .",
    "the final stage involves gradually restoring the particle interactions to full strength , whilst simultaneously switching off the gaussian potential wells .",
    "integration of free energy derivatives is used to estimate the free energy difference along the path .",
    "the constrained fluid-@xmath0 integration method was tested by application to the lennard - jones fluid where it was used to determine two coexistence state points .",
    "this test led the author to conclude that the method `` can not be said to be computationally efficient '' @xcite , at least in its present form .",
    "this finding presumably reflects the rather long and fragmented nature of the inter - phase path . although each of the stages of the path was initially reported to be reversible @xcite , further application of the method @xcite found this to be contingent on the correct tuning ( via trial and error ) of four separate constants relating to the characteristics of the gaussian potential wells .",
    "indeed , it is not clear to us that one can generally expect _ a - priori _ that the stated path will be trouble - free ; for example , it seems hard to rule out that the transformation of the original fluid to a weakly interacting fluid might intersect a first order ( pseudo ) liquid - vapor transition .",
    "furthermore we speculate that for large systems the reliance on particle diffusion to translate particles to unoccupied lattice sites may become problematic .",
    "very recently , mastny and de pablo @xcite have proposed a method based on measurements of the density of states , which aims to directly estimate the free energy difference of f and cs phases .",
    "the rationale for the method is its authors assertion that : `` to connect the free energy of the solid and liquid phases , there must exist a portion of energy and volume space that can be simultaneously sampled by both solid and liquid phases '' . to exploit this premise ,",
    "a series of simulations of the lennard - jones system were performed , each restricted to and sampling the configuration space of one of a set of overlapping `` windows '' in the space of the total energy @xmath1 and volume @xmath2 .",
    "successive windows were positioned appropriately such as to form a path linking the two well - separated regions of @xmath3 associated with the typical configurations of the respective phases . along this path , a central range of @xmath3 was indeed reported to be found for which both liquid and solid phase configurations could be sampled .",
    "a simple average @xcite of the solid phase and liquid phase density of states was accumulated in the central range and joined for continuity to the measured forms of the liquid and solid density of states on either side .    in our opinion ,",
    "the existence of a range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 that can be sampled by both liquid and solid phases is insufficient to connect the respective branches of the density of states because these are ( like their underlying sets of characteristic configurations ) , fundamentally _ distinct_. instead , for a proper connection",
    ", the phases must be linked via a continuous ( and reversible ) path through configuration space . in the context of the method of mastny and de pablo ,",
    "this necessitates repeated ( back and forth ) _ transitions _ between the two pure phases . since no mention is made in ref .",
    "@xcite of any such transitions , the validity of the method would appear to be questionable @xcite .",
    "another very recent approach to the f - cs problem , which bears some resemblance to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , is the `` multi - nph '' method of escobedo @xcite . here",
    "a path is constructed in the _ enthalpy _ of the system , spanning the range of values between those typical of the respective equilibrium phases at some prescribed pressure .",
    "the system temperature is ascertained at each point along the path , and exhibits a discontinuity at some value of the enthalpy as the favored phase of the system changes .",
    "ti with respect to the temperature variations along the path yields the free energy difference .",
    "the problem reported with this method was that it was apparently necessary for equilibration purposes to initialize the system in the cs phase at all points along the enthalpy path .",
    "however , it was difficult to be sure whether , for a given enthalpy value , the system had relaxed to the phase of minimum free energy , and hence whether the ti result was unbiased .",
    "this seems to us to be a manifestation of the familiar drawback of ti , namely the difficulty of finding a reversible integration path .",
    "phase switch monte carlo ( psmc ) @xcite is a further relatively recent method designed to directly link f and cs phases via a reversible sampling path .",
    "the method builds on previous work @xcite in which it was demonstrated that the configuration spaces associated with two phases of a many - body system can both be visited in a single monte carlo simulation , by harnessing extended sampling methods to facilitate a direct switch from one phase to the other .",
    "the method , which is quite generally applicable , was initially deployed in a study of hard sphere freezing @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was applied to soft potentials by errington @xcite , who used it to calculate two points on the freezing line of the lennard - jones system for a number of system sizes .",
    "the present paper complements and extends errington s psmc study of the lj system .",
    "it is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : statmech ] we review some of the key results in the statistical mechanical formulation of f and cs phase configurational weights , and show how to construct , on this basis , a theoretical framework for computational estimation of free energy differences . sec  [ sec : method ] describes how this framework is exploited in principle , and realized in practice , by the psmc method .",
    "an application of the method to the lennard - jones system is reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] where we present estimates of large portions of the freezing curve for a number of system sizes .",
    "these we compare with the results of a previous gdi study , bootstrapped using ti at a single coexistence point .",

    "[ sec : concs ] details our conclusions and the prospects for further applications .",
    "within the framework of statistical mechanics , the free energy of a given phase is expressible in terms of its _",
    "configurational weight_. information regarding this weight can be accumulated via a simulation in the course of an exploration ( sampling ) of the microstates of the phase . while for fluid phases such an exploration encounters no great obstacles , a complication arises in the case of crystalline solids .",
    "specifically , it transpires that the relevant phase space of the solid is effectively fragmented into a number of mutually inaccessible regions .",
    "each fragment corresponds to a distinct permutation of the particles with respect to the lattice sites .",
    "the solid phase configurational weight can only be estimated for the single fragment in which it is initiated . since on symmetry grounds",
    "the weight contribution of every fragment is identical , the overall configurational weight of the solid is obtained by multiplying the measured weight of one fragment by the number of fragments . in this section we first show how to correctly count this fragment number .",
    "we then proceed to describe how the ratio of configurational weights of two phases is related to the ratio of their _ a priori _ probabilities ( a quantity directly accessible to simulation ) and thence to the free energy difference .",
    "consider a periodic system of @xmath4 classical particles confined to a volume @xmath2 , variable under a prescribed constant external pressure @xmath5 , and in equilibrium with a heat bath at prescribed constant temperature @xmath6 . within this constant-@xmath7 ensemble",
    "the configurational weight of a phase may be written as    @xmath8    here , @xmath9 labels the phase , while @xmath10 with @xmath11 the configurational energy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-label on the integral stands for some _ configurational constraint _ that picks out configurations @xmath12 that ` belong ' to phase @xmath9 . in the present work",
    "we shall be concerned with phases which are either fluid ( @xmath13 ) or crystalline solid ( @xmath14 ) in character , and choose to formulate the constraint in a form which reflects the situation actually encountered in monte carlo simulations of single phases .",
    "specifically , let @xmath15 denote some representative configuration of phase @xmath9 .",
    "then the constraint may be regarded as picking out those configurations which can be reached from @xmath16 on the simulation timescale .",
    "the timescale is presumed to be sufficiently long to explore ` one phase ' but still short compared to ( unaided ) inter - phase traverses .",
    "it is convenient to use the sites defined by @xmath16 as the origins of the particle coordinates .",
    "thus we define a set of displacement vectors @xmath17 where    @xmath18    and write @xmath19 . in the case of the fluid phase ,",
    "particles have the run of the entire system and hence _ all _ contributing configurations are reachable from any one ; we may write simply    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is some specific but arbitrary fluid configuration , which can be selected at random in the course of mc exploration of the fluid phase .    for the crystalline phase it is natural to choose @xmath22 to define the sites of a lattice of the appropriate symmetry and scale .",
    "but here one must recognize that the complete cs configuration space actually comprises a number of distinct mutually inaccessible _ fragments _ @xcite corresponding essentially to the different permutations of particles amongst lattice sites . by symmetry",
    "each fragment should contribute equally to the configurational weight .",
    "but in general , the typical timescale for particle interchanges between lattice sites greatly exceeds the accessible simulation timescale . in these circumstances",
    "mc simulation will visit ( and thus count ) only the states within the fragment in which it is initiated .",
    "the total configurational weight of the cs phase must therefore be obtained by multiplying the measured contribution of one fragment by the total number of fragments . since global translation ( permitted by the boundary conditions ) ensures that _ one _ fragment includes _ all _ possible locations of any chosen particle , the number of fragments is the number of ways of assigning the other @xmath23 particles to @xmath23 wigner - seitz cells of some underlying notional fixed lattice @xcite .",
    "this number is @xmath24 .",
    "thus    @xmath25    in order to make contact with the simulation methodology to be described below , it is expedient to define the total _ a priori _ probability of phase @xmath9 .",
    "this is given by the ratio of the configurational weight of phase @xmath9 to the total weight of the two phases @xcite :    @xmath26    combining this last equation with eqs .",
    "[ eq : zcaldef ] , [ eq : zsimpf ] and [ eq : zsimpcs ] , allows the ratio of the configurational weights of the two phases to be expressed in terms of the ratio of their _ a priori _ probabilities @xcite :    @xmath27    the link between the configurational weight of a phase and its gibbs free energy is forged by the definition :    @xmath28    inserting this into eq .",
    "[ eq : zrat ] , the gibbs free - energy - density difference between the phases can be written in the ( strategically suggestive ) form :    @xmath29    eqs .",
    "[ eq : zrat ] and  [ eq : gibbs ] provide a foundation for mc studies of fluid - solid phase coexistence .",
    "their formal promise is as follows : given an inter - phase sampling scheme that visits both the f and cs phases , @xmath30 ( and hence @xmath31 ) may be obtained as the ratio of the _ a priori _ probabilities of the phases .",
    "the latter quantity can be estimated simply as the ratio of the number of visits to each phase recorded in the course of a simulation . in order to exploit this framework , however , one must first design a singularity - free phase space path linking the f and cs phases , and then formulate a sampling strategy to traverse it .",
    "phase switch monte carlo is one realization of such a scheme .",
    "the relative stability of the f and cs phases is determined by the ratio of the associated configurational weights @xmath32 ( eq .  [ eq : zrat ] ) . to measure that ratio one needs a mc procedure which visits both solid and fluid regions of configuration space in the course of a single simulation run .",
    "the phase switch mc method is a general approach that facilitates such two - phase sampling .",
    "its principal feature is a phase space ` leap ' @xcite that directly maps a pure phase configuration of one phase onto a pure phase configuration of the other .",
    "the motivation for choosing such an inter - phase route for the f - cs problem is that it circumvents interfacial ( mixed - phase ) configurations and their attendant sampling difficulties ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : intro ] ) . in this section",
    "we describe how to apply the phase switch method in this context .     in each phase ; the displacement vectors @xmath33 connect the centers of the distinguishable ( numbered ) particles to these sites .",
    "the switch operation shown swaps the representative sites of one phase for those of the other phase , whilst maintaining @xmath33 constant .",
    "more generally , any desired transformation of @xmath33 ( eg . a scaling see text ) can be incorporated in the switch @xcite .",
    "the particular configuration @xmath33 shown is a `` gateway '' state ( see text ) because the magnitude of the effective energy change under the switch is small.,width=340 ]    the key to implementing the phase switch is the representation ( eq .  [ eq : origin ] ) of particle coordinates in term of displacements with respect to a representative configuration @xmath34 . by construction , the system may be transformed between the cs and f phase representative configurations simply by switching the vectors ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus by continuity , _ any _  cs ( f ) configuration ` sufficiently close ' to the representative one will also transform to a f ( cs ) state under this operation @xcite .",
    "this phase switch can itself be realized as an mc step , so that the phase label @xmath9 becomes a stochastic variable . by ` sufficiently close ' here , we mean that the energy change associated with the phase switch is such as to afford a reasonable chance of acceptance . fig .",
    "[ fig : psschem ] provides an illustration of the mechanism .",
    "we term the set of configurations for which the mc phase switch will be _ accepted _ the ` gateway ' states . in general , however , these gateway states constitute only a small fraction of the total respective configuration spaces of the phases , and consequently will rarely ( if ever ) be visited on simulation timescales . to ensure effective two - phase sampling ,",
    "the probabilities with which the gateway states are visited must be _",
    "enhanced_. this can be achieved by appeal to extended ( biased ) sampling methods .",
    "[ fig : blobs ] shows a schematic representation of the procedure .",
    "cs phase space replica fragments ( see text).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    the bias necessary to promote sampling of the gateway states is administered with respect to an ` order parameter ' some suitably chosen macrovariable of the system .",
    "the freedom in selecting this order parameter is circumscribed by the requirement that the associated microstates form a contiguous path through phase space linking the large number of equilibrium ( typical ) microstates to the relatively small number of gateway states . in the next subsection , we describe one choice of order parameter which has proved itself successful in this regard .",
    "one can devise a variety of order parameters that serve to form a suitable path leading from the equilibrium states to the gateway states .",
    "a definition that we have found to be effective is a variant of one originally employed by one of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , and which closely resembles a recent proposal by errington @xcite . here",
    "the order parameter comes in two parts ( or modes ) : ` tether ' and ` energy ' .",
    "the tether mode serves to draw particles close to the representative sites to which they are nominally associated .",
    "then , once all particles are within a prescribed distance of these sites , tether mode switches off and an energy mode order parameter takes over to guide particle to the gateway states for which the phase switch energy cost is sufficiently small to be accepted .    to elaborate , let @xmath36 denote the order parameter in mode @xmath37 and phase @xmath9 .",
    "then for tether mode we write @xmath38 and define an associated order parameter    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the distance of particle @xmath41 from its lattice site measured in units of the box length , and @xmath42 is a prescribed dimensionless threshold radius . only particles whose displacement @xmath43 exceeds this threshold contribute to @xmath44 .",

    "more generally , it would be interesting to attempt to apply the psmc method to molecular systems . here , however , the order parameter would probably need to be augmented in order to not only draw molecules to their representative sites , but also to align them appropriately .",
    "the authors thank jeff errington for providing numerical data from ref .  @xcite .",
    "here we derive the monte carlo acceptance probabilities used in the psmc method .    as described in the sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we choose to fix one particle at its representative site . the effect of this is to reduce the configurational weight of each phase by a factor of the system volume @xmath2 .",
    "thus for the fluid phase , eq .",
    "[ eq : zsimpf ] becomes                                            we note that the acceptance formula eq .",
    "[ eq : moveacc ] is actually no different to that pertaining to a fully unconstrained constant-@xmath7 ensemble @xcite . indeed",
    "a little thought reveals that the act of fixing one particle is simply equivalent to viewing the unconstrained system from the reference frame of that particle .",
    "such a change of reference frame has no consequences for acceptance criteria .",
    "consider next the inter - phase switch .",
    "this replaces one set of representative vectors , @xmath34 say , by the other , @xmath84 , while at the same time scaling the system volume and particle displacements by a constant factor chosen such that a ` typical ' volume @xmath85 of phase @xmath9 is matched to a ` typical ' volume @xmath86 of phase @xmath76 . for a volume update which _ scales _ the current value , one has @xmath168 , and referring back to the detailed balance relation eq .",
    "[ eq : db ] one finds                            eg the singular behaviour in the single - occupancy - cell ( soc ) model : h. ogura , m matsuda , t. ogawa , n. ogita and a. ueda , prog .",
    "* 58 * , 419 ( 1977 ) . for anything but hard spheres , in traversing the fluid phase",
    "there is also a liquid - vapor binodal to be circumnavigated .",
    "the actual implementation swaps replicas between the overlapping windows .",
    "these swaps are accepted with probability unity whenever two adjacent replicas are in the overlap region , and are rejected otherwise . in the central region , which has two exactly overlapping windows one for liquid and one for solid trail swaps are accepted with unit probability , yielding a ` density of states ' which is the simple average of those for the solid and liquid branches .                at our starting point",
    "( eq .  [ eq : zsimpdef ] ) the indices @xmath177 on the coordinates @xmath178 are _ particle _ labels which confer distinguishability .",
    "any ` correction for indistinguishability ' is made _",
    "post hoc_. with this perspective the ` fragments ' are ` distinct ' .    essentially , the global translation mode can be regarded as allowing the system to access @xmath4 permutations of the particles with respect to the underlying notional _ fixed _ lattice .",
    "doing so reduces the actual number of permutations from @xmath179 to @xmath24 . this point ( first emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite ) appears to have been neglected in previous studies of cs phase free energies .          in this work ,",
    "the scaling at the switch is applied to the box size , the representative configuration vectors and the displacement vectors .",
    "previous work @xcite chose to keep the displacement vectors constant at the switch .",
    "both methods are legitimate provided that the consequences for the switch acceptance probability ( see appendix .  [ sec : append1 ] ) are accommodated .      to ensure that no two sites of @xmath67 are atypically close to one another ( which might otherwise impede access to the gateway states ) , we ` anneal ' this configuration before adopting it .",
    "this entails quenching the system ( at constant volume ) , while suppressing crystallization by constraining particles to remain within a maximum displacement @xmath180 from their starting point .",
    "coexistence parameters are determined inherently more accurately by the psmc method than the number and energy densities of the respective phases ( cf .",
    ".  [ eq : error ] ) .",
    "one could therefore reduce ( at relatively little cost ) the uncertainties associated with the densities simply by performing additional single phase simulations at the stated coexistence parameters ."
