    "the phase diagrams of the solid solutions of the ferroelectric perovskite na@xmath6bi@xmath0tio@xmath3 ( nbt ) with other tetrahedral perovskites are actively studied , mainly with the intent of obtaining compositions close to a morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) between rhombohedral ( r ) and tetragonal ( t )  phases , with easily reorientable ferroelectric domains and high electromechanical coupling .",
    "in fact , nbt based perovskites are among the possible lead - free piezoelectric materials that would substitute the widely used pbzr@xmath7ti@xmath2o@xmath3 , when new environmental legislations will limit the use of pb containing materials .    the phase diagram of ( na@xmath0bi@xmath1ba@xmath2tio@xmath3 ( here abbreviated as nbt - bt or bnbt-@xmath8 )  is still uncertain in the interesting region @xmath9 including the mpb , particularly regarding the nature and extension of the presumably almost antiferroelectric ( afe ) phase that becomes ferroelectric ( fe ) on further cooling .",
    "also the temperature evolution of the structure of undoped nbt is the object of contradictory interpretations.@xcite the main difficulties in determining the structure of nbt by neutron or x - ray diffraction are due to the very low distortion in both the tetragonal and rhombohedral phases , with a cell distortion from cubic of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively,@xcite and to the structural disorder in the na / bi sublattice , which is averaged out and compensated by anomalously large thermal factors in the analysis.@xcite in addition , x - ray diffraction is little sensitive to the rotations of the o octahedra involved in the various structural transformations , due to the low atomic number of o. cation disorder is enhanced in the solid solutions with other perovskites ; it is responsible for the diffuse nature of the lower temperature transitions in the dielectric measurements , sometimes considered of the relaxor type , and possibly for the very broad temperature range of coexistence between t and r phases , with characteristics that vary from study to study .",
    "there is also scarce reproducibility of the transition temperatures and of the associated anomalies in the dielectric and other physical properties , which generally exhibit very broad anomalies with large hysteresis between heating and cooling.@xcite these uncertainties may also be connected with differences from sample to sample in the local cation ordering and non perfect stoichiometry in the na / bi sublattice , due to preferential loss of bi during sintering .",
    "the elastic constants should provide clear information on the occurrence of transformations between c , t and r phases , which are of ferroelastic nature , but to our knowledge only few studies of the acoustic properties of nbt exist,@xcite which have not an obvious connection with the known phase transitions . here",

    "the powders were isostatically pressed at 300  mpa and sintered at 1150  @xmath16c for 2  h. in order to avoid the loss of na and bi , which is significant at temperatures over 1000  @xmath16c , most of the sintering processes were carried out with the samples placed on a zro@xmath14 disc , covered with an al@xmath14o@xmath3 crucible and sealed with nbt pack .",
    "the x - ray diffraction analysis evidenced the pure perovskitic phase in all the samples investigated .",
    "the microstructure of the sintered samples was observed on polished and etched surfaces by means of scanning electron microscopy ( leica cambridge stereoscan 360 ) .",
    "depending on the composition ( at the same sintering conditions ) the microstructures result more or less homogeneous , with some large , squared grains in a matrix of smaller grains ; among those sintered in the nbt pack powder , pure nbt showed the largest grain size ( @xmath17  @xmath18 m ) , which reduced upon addition of barium , the lowest mean size being found with @xmath19 ( 0.5  @xmath18 m ) .",
    "we prepared discs ( diameter 22  mm , thickness 2  mm ) for the dielectric measurements and blocks ( @xmath20  mm@xmath21 ) subsequently cut into bars ( @xmath22  mm@xmath21 ) for both anelastic and dielectric experiments .",
    "the faces of the discs were ground , silver electroded and poled with an electric field of 3  kv / mm in a silicon oil bath at 120  @xmath16c for 30 min , while the bars were tested unpoled .",

    "such a value is affected by an error that may easily be of the order of 10% , due to uncertainties in the sample dimensions , porosity ( the density was always @xmath33 of the theoretical one ) and above all due to the ag electrode , which was applied to one or two faces and whose thickness and young s modulus could not be controlled .",
    "the anelastic spectra are displayed in terms of the real part of the reciprocal young s modulus or compliance , @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 , and of the elastic energy loss coefficient @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "since the anelastic spectroscopy experiments were made in vacuum , some oxygen loss occurred when 800  k were exceeded , and the sample became darker . in most cases , however , we did not note any effect on the anelastic and even dielectric spectra ; major changes occurred if 1000  k were exceeded with samples prepared without precautions against bi loss during sintering .",

    "this means that the anomalies in @xmath41 are not due to relaxation of domain walls or defects , but they reflect the intrinsic elastic constants plus the fast relaxation of the order parameters involved in the structural transformations , which can instantaneously follow the sample vibration .",

    "[ fig ov ] and the above discussion we can identify the temperatures @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the peaks in the elastic compliance with the onsets of the t - c and r - t transformations .",

    "[ fig ov]c ) causing the tetragonal distortion .",
    "the fact that the t - c transformation is evident in the elastic but absent in the dielectric susceptibility@xcite confirms that it is triggered by the non - polar rotational mode of the octahedra , as already discussed in connection with optical and high - frequency dielectric measurements.pkf04 the small hysteresis of 3  k between heating and cooling indicates that the transition is almost 2nd order .",
    "according to the landau theory of phase transitions without fluctuations , the expected effect on the elastic constants involved in the resulting tetragonal distortion is a negative step when passing from cubic to tetragonal at @xmath44,@xcite or equivalently a positive step in the compliances .",
    "the elastic anomaly at @xmath44 has a consistent peaked component besides the step , but clearly corresponds to the almost 2nd order t - c transition .",

    "these compliance curves @xmath41 and particularly the acoustic losses are sharply peaked at a temperature @xmath45 with only 13  k of hysteresis between heating and cooling and allow us to define a precise temperature for the r - t transition ( note the sharpness of the losses at higher frequency at @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in the light of the most recent experiments ,",
    "bkn06,dtb08,dtb09 the temperature @xmath45 can be identified with the onset of the appearance of the r  structure , which however appears gradually as a modulation between the m - type in - phase tilts of the octahedra about the @xmath57 axis in the t phase and the r - type antiphase tilts of the r phase , bkn06 or as finely twinned r phase.@xcite again , the fact that the anomaly is sharp and pronounced in the elastic compliance and less defined in the dielectric susceptibility suggests that the primary order parameter is the r - type tilting of the octahedra , which in turn induces a change in the direction and amplitude of the cation shifts .",
    "conversely , there is no trace of the ferroelectric transition at @xmath51 in the elastic compliance .",
    "this may also be due to the fact that the ferroelectric transition does not seem to involve a change in the structure , but only in the size and correlation length of the domains .",
    "the present measurements do not allow yet to unify the different pictures of the r phase obtained from various techniques into a coherent one , but indicate that , in spite of the various indications of extreme heterogeneity on the local scale , short correlation lengths and relaxor - like behavior , the r - type instability responsible for the r phase produces an elastic anomaly comparable to those of other crystalline perovskites with normal structural transitions occurring at a well defined temperature .    the above data can be compared with @xmath73 measured on a nbt crystal with the ultrasonic pulse echo technique,@xcite where a shallow minimum is found near 580  k , with @xmath74  k of hysteresis between heating and cooling .",
    "_ _  _ _ the minimum has been attributed to relaxation of the polar regions rather that to the phase transition itself , and , although its temperature is close to @xmath45 , it is much shallower than the peak in the reciprocal young s modulus @xmath39 . considering that the phase transition at @xmath45 involves the rhombohedral distortion , it is possible that the sharper response of the young s modulus is mainly due to the shear elastic constants of @xmath75symmetry .",
    "two brillouin scattering experiments , which probe the acoustic properties at much higher frequencies , yield still different results . in one case@xcite a dip in sound velocity and a peak in damping are found near 700  k , which , instead of coinciding with one of the temperatures of the t - c and r - t  transitions , is between the two .",
    "the observation has been explained in terms of strong fluctuations of the two coupled order parameters for the two t and r  phases , plus disorder in the na / bi sublattice and has been put in parallel to relaxor ferroelectrics . in a more recent experiment,@xcite the intensity of the quasi - elastic light scattering and a distortion of the phonon peaks from a lorentzian shape are found to be peaked at 550  k , which is about @xmath45 .",
    "it is true that different techniques may produce different pictures of a same system ; for example local probes like the nmr or exafs spectroscopies indicate larger and more disordered cation displacements than diffraction techniques.@xcite yet , the quality of samples is important for nbt , since different samples may give different results from the same technique , notably in the dielectric and ferroelectric properties .",
    "the main issues are cation ordering , stoichiometry and related defects providing ionized electronic charges .",
    "regarding cation ordering , there are ferroelectric perovskites like pb(sc@xmath0ta@xmath0)o@xmath3 ( pst ) , where the level of sc / ta ordering can be controlled and produces marked effects on the temperature and diffuseness of the ferroelectric transition.@xcite in nbt , in some case superlattice @xmath76 peaks have been observed by x - ray diffraction @xcite or tem@xcite and attributed to an alternation of bi and na along the three directions , but usually cation order is found to be very weak and localized@xcite or absent,@xcite so that a random distribution is assumed.@xcite the level of cation ordering in nbt and its solid solutions with other perovskites is not controllable as in pst , and prolonged annealings in order to improve ordering might rather cause loss of bi,@xcite so that a spread of the nbt properties from sample to sample is not surprising .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to check whether the sharp elastic anomalies of nbt in fig .",
    "fig1 are the result of a sample of exceptional quality .",
    "figure [ fig nbtsamples ] shows the anelastic spectra of three samples of nbt prepared in different ways .",

    "elastic energy loss @xmath46 measured on heating ( thick lines ) and cooling ( thin lines ) at @xmath77  khz on three samples of nbt prepared as described in the text.,width=8 ]    it is apparent that the bi / na stoichiometry is an issue , since in sample 3 only a reminiscence of the t - c transition at @xmath44 remains with the sign of the step in the compliance even reversed , and also the transition at @xmath45 is smeared ; in addition , strong irreversible relaxation phenomena occur above 750  k , which are absent in the stoichiometric samples .",
    "such relaxation processes appear as an elastic energy loss two orders of magnitude larger than in the cubic phase of stoichiometric samples , and are presumably due to the migration of the light na ion by a vacancy mechanism in the cation deficient na / bi sublattice .",
    "the effect is absent in a perfectly stoichiometric lattice .",
    "the dielectric susceptibilities of two samples prepared as sample 1 and 3 ( not shown here ) demonstrate that the less stoichiometric samples of type 3 are indeed of extremely bad quality also from the dielectric point of view , with enormous losses due to mobile charges , which totally conceal the transition at @xmath51 .",
    "on the other hand , samples of type 1 present @xmath78 curves entirely comparable to those of `` good '' samples in the literature ; therefore , the sharp elastic anomalies at @xmath45 should not be ascribed to an exceptional quality of those samples , but are a general property of nbt .",
    "in addition , the elastic anomaly at @xmath45 clearly persists , although broadened , also in less stoichiometric samples of type 3 , where the other transitions are washed out .",
    "this demonstrates that the rotational instability leading to the r - t transformation is also robust against lattice disorder .",

    "notice that the anomalies of both permittivity and compliance are evident during heating but disappear during cooling , indicating that in the highly disordered nbt - bt there is a slow structural evolution in the r phase , presumably domain coarsening .",

    "the secondary maximum has been associated with an incommensurate modulation between fe and afe state,@xcite as found in the highly ordered ferroelectric perovskite pb(yb@xmath0ta@xmath0)o@xmath3.@xcite incommensurate modulation of the r phase along the @xmath57 axis of the parent t phase has indeed been found by neutron diffraction@xcite and its persistence after the disappearance of the t phase has been suggested to be due to some type of ordering in the na / bi sublattice .",
    "also tem experiments indicate a r phase modulated by twins,@xcite but at @xmath96 .",
    "our dielectric and anelastic spectra do not show features necessarily ascribable to incommensurate modulations ; the anelastic losses remain high also below @xmath45 and @xmath51 , but this might also be due to generic domain wall motion .",
    "apparently , such walls may give rise to incommensurate modulations , whose morphology likely depends on the sample quality .",
    "in this respect , we recall that the dielectric hump that is presumed to accompany incommensurate modulations is enhanced by introducing cation vacancies through la doping@xcite or in solid solution with k@xmath0bi@xmath0tio@xmath3@xcite or batio@xmath3.@xcite it is therefore likely that the exact stoichiometry and degree of ordering of cations determine the detailed structural distortions , their correlation lengths and domain morphologies , and the scarce consistency between the results of various experiments is not only due to differences in the properties that are probed but also in the quality of the samples .",

    "the latter is mainly based on dielectric measurements and therefore does not include the border between t and c phases .",
    "it is sometimes assumed that the paraelectric phase above @xmath55 is cubic , but this can not be the case at low enough @xmath89 , since the neutron diffraction data show that nbt is tetragonal above @xmath64 and becomes cubic only at @xmath97  k.

    "the three open circles at @xmath102 refer to three different samples where the anomaly at @xmath44 is extremely shallow and broadened .",
    "the region of the phase diagram defined by @xmath101 and @xmath103 is of uncertain nature . in ( nbt)@xmath7(bt)@xmath2 co -",
    "doped with zr , with a particularly evident relaxor - like frequency dispersion in @xmath87 near @xmath51 , such a region has been defined as a frustrated region with coexistence of  `` multiple domain states''.@xcite the fading away of the anelastic anomaly at @xmath44 with increasing @xmath89 suggests that for @xmath101 and @xmath104 @xmath51 the phase is pseudocubic with local tetragonal distortions whose correlation length must be very small .",
    "the temperature @xmath64 of the broad maximum of @xmath105 is somewhat lower than in ref . , while the temperature @xmath83 of the maximum of the compliance is up to 60  k lower than @xmath64 .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in the relaxor ferroelectrics pb(mg@xmath106nb@xmath107)@xmath7ti@xmath2o@xmath3 and ( pb / la)(zr / ti)o@xmath3 , where the dielectric maximum is at a temperature higher than the maximum of the elastic compliance but also of the susceptibility deduced from nmr relaxation@xcite ( but , unlike dielectric and anelastic spectroscopies , nmr probes also excitations with @xmath108 , see ref . ) .",
    "this has been explained as the result of the different sensitivity of the three techniques to the polar on one hand and non - polar rotational degrees of freedom on the other hand , all exhibiting a relaxational dynamics which is faster for the rotational ones.@xcite indeed , also the dielectric maximum in nbt - bt acquires a dispersion in frequency with ba doping . in nbt - bt , however , the r - type rotational degrees of freedom undergo a phase transformation at @xmath45 ; therefore , the elastic maximum at @xmath83 should involve other rotational degrees of freedom , possibly also m - type rotations , which are coupled to the polar modes and hence yield dielectric and elastic susceptibility maxima at similar temperatures .    the @xmath109 line separating the r from the t phases joins @xmath110 very soon , at @xmath84 according to hiruma _ _ et al.__@xcite and already at @xmath92 after our measurements .",
    "there is some variability in the values of @xmath45 determined from the dielectric curves , depending on the polarization state , but overall there is good agreement with @xmath45 determined from the anelastic spectra on unpoled samples . at @xmath111",
    "the @xmath112 line starts rising , while @xmath109 continues to decrease , determining the mpb .",
    "as noted in the previous paragraphs , the dielectric anomaly at @xmath45 may be not very sharp , especially in unpoled samples , and the marked anomalies measured at @xmath113 may mainly reflect the ferroelectric transition .",
    "the compliance , however , is almost unaffected by the ferroelectric transition , and always presents a sharp step at @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the rotational instability of r type has a clear onset at a well defined temperature @xmath45 also at compositions where ( nbt)@xmath7(bt)@xmath114 displays properties typical of highly disordered or relaxor systems .",
    "notably , the sharp step in @xmath41 coexist with the broad maximum at @xmath115 and a t - c transition that is almost completely faded away at @xmath116 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig anelvsx ] and [ fig bnbt6 ] ) .",
    "it turns out , therefore , that the polar modes are strongly affected by disorder , characterized by short correlation lengths and undergo a diffuse or relaxor transition ; on the other hand , the r - type modes undergo a phase transition which is well - behaved from the elastic point of view , presumably with a long correlation length .",
    "the composition - temperature phase diagrams of various solid solutions between a perovskite which is rhombohedral at low temperature and one which is tetrahedral , have an almost vertical line that separates the two phases and is called morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) . among the most studied ferroelectric systems of this type are pzt@xcite and pmn - pt.@xcite after decades of studies on pzt , it has been found that an intermediate monoclinic phase exists in a narrow region at the mpb.@xcite the identification of such a monoclinic phase , where the direction of the polarization may continuously vary between those in the r and t phases , was possible from high - resolution synchrotron x - ray diffraction experiments and careful analysis of the neutron diffraction data .",
    "the possibility for the polarization to continuously rotate between the t and r phases through the monoclinic one is still debated,@xcite  but is generally considered as the key factor that yields an easy change of polarization under stress and therefore high electromechanical coupling at the mpb compositions.@xcite    the solid solution nbt - bt at room temperature passes from r to t at the composition @xmath117 , which is generally identified with the mpb , and where the electromechanical coupling is maximum .",
    "actually , there are few studies aimed at defining the mpb line @xmath109,tms91,hwn07 which , to our knowledge , is defined by only two points at @xmath118 and 0.07 .",
    "other tetragonal perovskites that give rise to a mpb with nbt are pbtio@xmath3@xcite and k@xmath0bi@xmath0tio@xmath3 , but in the latter the composition of kbt at the border between r and t at room temperature has been reported to range between 0.17 and 0.8.@xcite    besides better defining the mpb line , it would be interesting to investigate whether also nbt - bt has an intermediate monoclinic phase that allows continuous rotation of the polarization between the pseudocubic @xmath119 $ ] and @xmath63 $ ] directions .",
    "the identification of a monoclinic phase by diffraction would certainly be more difficult for ( nbt)@xmath93(bt)@xmath2 than for pzt , due to the larger disorder caused by the coexistence of ions with different charges , na@xmath120 , bi@xmath121 and ba@xmath122 in the a sublattice with respect to zr@xmath123 and ti@xmath123 , which have the same charge",
    ". the signature of the m  phase should be more evident in the elastic compliance versus temperature : in fact , the reciprocal young s modulus of pzt has a large peak in correspondence with the mpb,@xcite that may be simply explained in terms of the usual landau free energy expansion with a coupling term linear in strain and quadratic in the polarization , if the polarization may rotate in a monoclinic phase instead of switching between r and t phases.@xcite    the case of ( nbt)@xmath7(bt)@xmath2 is more complicated than pzt , since there is no single transformation between t  and m , but two distinct processes : a r - t  transformation at @xmath45 and a diffuse transformation around @xmath83 and @xmath64 .",
    "the first is well behaved from the elastic point of view , with the expected sharp step in the compliance at the r - type rotational instability.@xcite if monoclinic distortions exist , they must be connected with the diffuse process .",
    "the fact that it is the main feature in the dielectric susceptibility indicates that it is due to polar modes , while the strong peaked response in the elastic compliance recalls the behavior of the monoclinic phase of pzt . at variance with pzt",
    ", however , there should not be a monoclinic phase , but only local monoclinic distortions with short correlation lengths , thereby producing a diffuse response .",
    "this is in agreement with recent nmr@xcite and diffuse x - ray scattering experiments,@xcite both revealing additional displacements of the na / bi ions away from the rhombohedral @xmath124 direction along @xmath125 , producing a local monoclinic symmetry .",
    "the existence of monoclinic regions is also supported by a diffuse scattering experiment,@xcite from which it can be deduced that they are shaped as platelets one or two cell thick and 20  nm wide .",
    "we measured the complex dielectric permittivity and elastic compliance of ( nbt)@xmath7(bt)@xmath2 with @xmath4 .",
    "the anelastic spectra contain anomalies at both the temperatures @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the tetragonal - cubic and tetragonal - rhombohedral transitions , plus a broad maximum at a temperature @xmath83 , which is up to 60  k lower then @xmath64 of the the diffuse dielectric maximum .",
    "the @xmath126 line in the @xmath127 phase diagram drops rapidly with @xmath89 and can be followed up to @xmath128 , where the transition becomes so diffuse and weak to be hardly recognizable . at higher ba substitution ,",
    "the high temperature structure should be pseudocubic with short range tetragonal distortions . instead , the elastic anomaly at @xmath45 is extremely sharp in pure nbt and remains distinct up to @xmath5 , demonstrating that there is a well defined onset of the r - type octahedral rotations producing the r structure , in spite of the numerous indications of extremely diffuse transition and structural heterogeneity .",
    "the dielectric permittivity in our samples does not have a secondary maximum with frequency dispersion around the ferroelectric transition at @xmath51 , as often reported ; instead , we observe steps both at @xmath129 and @xmath45 ( which however coincide for @xmath130 ) , whose exact temperature and sharpness depend on the sample state and polarization .",
    "these features are common to samples prepared under different temperature and time schedules , if precautions are taken in order to avoid bi loss during sintering ; otherwise , the anelastic and dielectric spectra indicate extremely blurred structural transformations and defective material , especially above 800  k , where na diffusion becomes possible through the vacancy mechanism .",
    "the anelastic and dielectric anomalies should be connected to the non - polar rotational modes of the octahedra and polar cation displacement as follows .",
    "the m - type rotations giving rise to the t  phase becomes unstable at @xmath44 , but the correlation length of such modes rapidly decreases with ba substitution , so that at @xmath101 no long range t order exists any more .",
    "the r - type rotations giving rise to the r distortion are unstable at @xmath45 , and maintain long range correlations up to @xmath5 , which is the ba composition of the morphotropic phase boundary .",
    "the diffuse dielectric maximum at @xmath64 and elastic maximum at @xmath83 should be due to polar modes , whose correlation length remains short unless an external poling field is applied or aging of the order of several days at room temperature is allowed .    with ba substitution ,",
    "the broad peak in the elastic compliance becomes preponderant over the r - t  transition and , by analogy with the behavior of pzt with monoclinic structure at the mpb , the possibility is discussed that on the local scale the polarization may have an intermediate direction between r and t.      the authors sincerely thank mr .",
