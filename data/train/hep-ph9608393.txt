    "there is a widespread general consensus , much grown in the last years and based both on surprising experimental results and intense theoretical activity , that the spin structure and the spin dynamical properties of nucleons and hadrons in general are far from being understood ; a satisfactory knowledge of hadronic structure and dynamics and their correct description in terms of constituents can not ignore the spin subtleties and more experimental information is badly required .",
    "+ an experiment ( ` _ hera@xmath12 _ '",
    "@xcite ) utilising an internal polarized nucleon target in the 820  gev hera proton beam would constitute a natural extension of the studies of the nucleon spin structure in progress at desy with the _ hermes _ experiment @xcite .",
    "conceivably , this would be the only place where to study high energy nucleon ",
    "nucleon spin physics besides the dedicated rhic spin program at bnl @xcite supposed to start early in the next decade . + an internal polarized nucleon target offering unique features such as polarization above 80% and no or small dilution , can be safely operated in a proton ring at high densities up to @xmath13 atoms/@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "as long as the polarized target is used in conjunction with an unpolarized proton beam , the physics scope of _",
    "hera@xmath12 _ would be focused to ` phase  i ' , i.e. measurements of single spin asymmetries .",
    "once later polarized protons should become available , the same set - up would be readily available to measure a variety of double spin asymmetries .",
    "these ` phase  ii ' measurements would constitute an alternative   fixed target   approach to similar physics which will be accessible to the collider experiments _ star _ and _ phenix _ at the low end of the rhic energy scale ( @xmath15  gev ) @xcite .",
    "we shall briefly discuss here the physics motivations to measure single and double spin asymmetries in several @xmath16 inclusive and exclusive processes ; more details and further discussions , together with a complete list of references , which we can not give here for lack of space , can be found in ref .",
    "we recall that the integrated luminosity calculation is based upon realistic figures . for the average beam and target polarisation @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "are assumed , respectively .",
    "a combined trigger and reconstruction efficiency of @xmath19 is anticipated .",
    "using @xmath20 for the average hera proton beam current ( 50% of the design value ) and a rather conservative polarized target density of @xmath21 atoms/@xmath14 the projected integrated luminosity becomes @xmath22 when for the total running time @xmath23 an equivalent of @xmath24 at 100  % efficiency is assumed .",
    "this corresponds to about 3 real years under present hera conditions .",
    "however , proton currents much higher than the original hera design value of 160 ma are envisaged in the hera luminosity upgrade program .",
    "in addition , experience from ua6 running at cern shows that after having gained some practical running experience it presumably becomes feasible to operate the polarized gas target at about 3 times higher density without seriously affecting the proton beam lifetime .",
    "hence in a few years 500 pb@xmath0 _ per year _ will presumably become a realistic figure .",
    "+ we note that , except in the case of single spin asymmetries , we took into account major acceptance limitations and jet detection efficiencies .",
    "hence it can be anticipated that the sensitivities shown in the rest of the paper are realistic for an about one year s running of a future polarized nucleon ",
    "nucleon scattering experiment at hera .",
    "any better estimate requires considerably intensified efforts to be invested along many different directions , like machine and target limitations , detector capabilities versus rate , acceptance , costs etc .",
    "single spin asymmetries in large @xmath2 inclusive production , both in proton - nucleon and lepton - nucleon interactions , have recently received much attention ( for references see @xcite ) . the naive expectation that they should be zero in perturbative qcd",
    "has been proven to be false , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "it is now clear that higher twist effects are responsible for these asymmetries , which should be zero only in leading twist-2 perturbative qcd .",
    "+ several models and theoretical analyses suggest possible higher twist effects : there might be twist-3 dynamical contributions , which we shall denote as hard scattering higher twists ; there might also be intrinsic @xmath25 effects , both in the quark fragmentation process and in the quark distribution functions .",
    "the latter are not by themselves higher twist contributions - they are rather non - perturbative universal nucleon properties - but give rise to twist-3 contributions when convoluted with the hard scattering cross sections .",
    "the dynamical contributions result from a short distance part calculable in perturbative qcd with slightly modified feynman rules , combined with a long distance part related to quark - gluon correlations .",
    "+ an intrinsic @xmath25 effect in the quark fragmentation is known as collins or sheared jet effect ; it simply amounts to say that the number of hadrons @xmath26 ( say , pions ) resulting from the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark , with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath27 and transverse momentum @xmath28 , depends on the quark spin orientation .",
    "that is , one expects the _ quark fragmentation analysing power _",
    "@xmath29 to be different from zero : @xmath30 where , by parity invariance , the quark spin should be orthogonal to the @xmath31 plane .",
    "notice also that time reversal invariance does not forbid such quantity to be @xmath32 because of the ( necessary ) soft interactions of the fragmenting quark with external strong fields , i.e. because of final state interactions .",
    "this idea has been applied to the computation of the single spin asymmetries observed in @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "+ a similar idea applies to the distribution functions , provided soft gluon interactions between initial state partons are present and taken into account , which most certainly is the case for hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "that is , one can expect that the number of quarks with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath34 and transverse intrinsic motion @xmath28 depends on the transerve spin direction of the parent nucleon , so that the _ quark distribution analysing power _ @xmath35 can be different from zero : @xmath36 this effect also has been used to explain the single spin asymmetries observed in @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "note that both @xmath29 and @xmath35 are leading twist quantities which , when convoluted with the elementary cross - sections and integrated over @xmath28 , give twist-3 contributions to the single spin asymmetries .",
    "+    each of the above mechanisms might be present and might be important in understanding twist-3 contributions ; in particular the quark fragmentation or distribution analysing powers look like new non - perturbative universal quantities , crucial in clarifying the spin structure of nucleons .",
    "it is then of great importance to study possible ways of disentangling these different contributions in order to be able to assess the importance of each of them .",
    "we propose here to measure the single spin asymmetry @xmath37 in several different processes @xmath38 which should allow to fulfil such a task . to obtain a complete picture",
    "we need to consider nucleon - nucleon interactions together with other processes , like lepton - nucleon scattering , which might add valuable information .",
    "for each of them we discuss the possible sources of higher twist contributions , distinguishing , according to the above discussion , between those originating from the hard scattering and those originating either from the quark fragmentation or distribution analysing power .",
    "@xmath39 + in this process all kinds of higher twist contributions may be present ; this asymmetry _ alone _ could not help in evaluating the relative importance of the different terms .",
    "@xmath40 + here there is no fragmentation process , and we remain with possible sources of non - zero single spin asymmetries in the hard scattering or the quark distribution analysing power .",
    "@xmath41 + in such a process the single spin asymmetry can originate either from hard scattering or from @xmath25 effects in the fragmentation function , but not in the distribution functions , as soft initial state interactions are suppressed by powers of @xmath42 . moreover , this process allows , in principle , a direct measurement of the collins effect , i.e. of the quark fragmentation analysing power , via a measurement of the leading - twist difference of cross sections for the production of two identical particles inside the same jet , with opposite @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath43 + each of these processes yields a single spin asymmetry which can not originate from distribution or fragmentation @xmath44 effects ; it may only be due to higher - twist hard scattering effects , which would thus be isolated .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that a careful and complete study of single spin asymmetries in several processes might be a unique way of understanding the origin and importance of higher twist contributions in inclusive hadronic interactions ; not only , but it might also allow a determination of fundamental non - perturbative properties of quarks inside polarized nucleons and of polarized quark fragmentations .",
    "such properties should be of universal value and applicability and their knowledge might be as important as the knowledge of unpolarized distribution and fragmentation functions .",
    "+ in the following we discuss the capability of hera-@xmath45 to investigate some of these processes . +    * inclusive pion production * @xmath46 at 200 gev exhibits surprisingly large single spin asymmetries , as it was measured a few years ago by the e704 collaboration using a transversely polarized beam @xcite . for any kind of pions the asymmetry @xmath47 shows a considerable rise above @xmath48 , i.e. in the fragmentation region of the polarized nucleon .",
    "it is positive for both @xmath49 and @xmath50 mesons , while it has the opposite sign for @xmath51 mesons .",
    "the charged pion data taken in the @xmath52  gev range were split into two samples at @xmath2  =  0.7   gev / c ; the observed rise is stronger for the high @xmath2 sample , as can be seen from fig .",

    "note that in the large @xmath2 region the contours calculated with big @xmath57 bins are appropriate , since usually a larger bin size is chosen where the statistics starts to decrease .",
    "we can conclude that the accessible @xmath2 values are significantly larger than those e704 had ; the combined @xmath2 dependence of all involved higher - twist effects can be measured with good accuracy ( @xmath58 ) up to transverse momenta of about 10  gev / c in the central region @xmath59 and up to 6  gev / c in the target fragmentation region .",
    "this corresponds to an almost one order of magnitude extension in the @xmath2 range in comparison to e704 .",
    "the capability of hera-@xmath12 to really prove a predicted @xmath2 dependence is shown in fig .",

    "+    * inclusive direct photon production * , @xmath60 , proceeds without fragmentation , i.e. the photon carries directly the information from the hard scattering process .",
    "hence this process measures a combination of initial @xmath28 effects and hard scattering twist3 processes .",
    "the first and only results up to now were obtained by e704 collaboration @xcite showing an asymmetry compatible with zero within large errors for @xmath61  gev / c in the central region @xmath62 .",
    "+ the experimental sensitivity of hera-@xmath45 was determined using pythia  5.7 by simultaneous simulation of the two dominant hard subprocesses contributing to direct photon production , i.e. gluon",
    " compton scattering ( @xmath63 ) and quark  antiquark annihilation ( @xmath64 ) , and of background photons that originate mainly from @xmath50 and @xmath65 decays .",
    "it turns out that a good sensitivity ( about 0.05 ) can be maintained up to @xmath66 8 gev / c . for increasing transverse momentum the annihilation subprocess and",

    "our calculations at hera-@xmath45 energies @xcite show an asymmetry less than 0.01 in the region @xmath68 , i.e. the effect is practically unobservable .",
    "perturbative qcd allows sizeable lowest order double spin asymmetries for various 2@xmath692 partonic subprocesses . relying on the factorization theorem a rich spectrum of asymmetries at the hadronic level",
    "can be predicted which constitute the backbone of the rhic spin physics program . when both incoming particles are longitudinally polarized , the insufficient knowledge of the polarized gluon distribution makes the predictions for double spin asymmetries @xmath70 to some extent uncertain .",
    "conversely , the measurement of @xmath70 in certain final states seems to be one of the most valuable tools to measure the polarized gluon distribution function in the nucleon .",
    "the presently most accurate way to do so is the study of those processes which can be calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd , i.e. for which the involved production cross sections and subprocess asymmetries can be predicted . both _ direct photon ( plus jet ) _ and _ j/@xmath3 ( plus jet ) _ production are most suited because there are only small uncertainties due to fragmentation .",

    "* inclusive photon production * with hera@xmath12 was the subject of a very recent study @xcite .",

    "+ at this point we note that the hera@xmath12 fixed target kinematics causes additional problems for the jet reconstruction when compared to a collider experiment . as obtained from rather preliminary investigations @xcite , the number of photon events accompanied by a successfully reconstructed jet decreases considerably when approaching lower values of @xmath2 and , correspondingly , of @xmath78 . to have a more realistic statistical significance than that shown in ref .",

    "+    * @xmath81 production . *",
    "compared to direct photon production the production of quarkonium states below the open charm threshold is a similarly clean tool to measure the polarized gluon distribution .",
    "hence many statements made in the previous section apply here , as well , and the principle of analysis is very similar . because of the relatively large quark mass the @xmath82 production cross section and the expected asymmetry are supposed to be calculable perturbatively .",
    "+ quarkonium production has traditionally been calculated in the color - singlet model ( csm ) @xcite where the quark - antiquark pair is produced in a color - singlet state with the quantum numbers of the corresponding hadron .",
    "this heavy mass pair then creates the hadronic state with a probability determined by the appropriate quarkonium wave function at the origin .",
    "it is assumed that for heavy quarks soft gluon emission is negligible , as also other non - perturbative effects like higher twist contributions .",
    "while this model gives a reasonable description of @xmath81 production cross section shapes over @xmath2 and @xmath76 , it completely fails in the explanation of the integrated cross section ; a k factor of @xmath83 is needed to explain the data .",
    "the anomalously large cross section @xcite for @xmath81 production at large transverse momenta found at the tevatron reveals another bad feature of the csm ; it is not able to explain the large @xmath84 and direct @xmath81 production rates at cdf .",
    "all these observations led to the understanding that fragmentation and hadronization of color - octet @xcite _ @xmath85 _ pairs are essential in the heavy quarkonium production process .",
    "+ within the framework of the color - octet mechanism the quarkonium production process can be separated , according to the factorization hypothesis , into a short and a long distance part .",
    "the former describes the quark - antiquark pair production at small distances and can be computed perturbatively .",
    "the latter is responsible for the creation of a particular hadronic state from the quark - antiquark pair ; its matrix elements can not be calculated perturbatively .",
    "+ the shapes of the @xmath2 distribution of short distance matrix elements calculated within the color - octet model indicate that the new mechanism seems to be able to explain the tevatron data for direct @xmath81 and @xmath84 production at large @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we note that unlike color - singlet matrix elements being connected to the subsequent hadronic non - relativistic wave functions at the origin , color - octet long distance matrix elements are unknown and have to be extracted from the experiment .",
    "as it was shown recently @xcite the color - octet mechanism gives the dominant contribution in @xmath81-production at hera@xmath12 energies .",
    "this concerns not only the total cross section @xcite , but also @xmath81 production at non - zero @xmath2 , i.e. at those values of transverse momenta which are not due to internal motion of partons inside the colliding hadrons , @xmath86 gev / c @xcite .",
    "+ * for inclusive @xmath81 production * we calculated the double spin - asymmetry within the framework of the color - octet model using the value of the color - octet matrix elements from @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the magnitude of the asymmetry does almost not depend on the choice of the color - octet matrix elements , if one assumes that the transition matrix elements of octet @xmath87-states into @xmath81 are negligible compared to those of the @xmath88 state .",
    "this is the most likely scenario since only in this case it is possible to establish a consistence between different combinations of the above two matrix elements , as extracted from cdf data @xcite and photo- @xcite or hadroproduction @xcite data .",
    "we underline that the measurement of the double spin asymmetry in @xmath81 production would allow to extract information about the color - octet matrix elements _ separately _ , whereas from unpolarized experiments it is only possible to extract combinations of them .    in fig .",
    "[ figavto]a we present the expected asymmetry versus @xmath2 for two different sets of polarized gluon distributions taken from @xcite ; the solid curve corresponds to set  a and the dashed one to set  c. for set  a the asymmetry appears sufficiently large to be observed and its measurement would allow to extract information about the polarized gluon distribution function in the nucleon . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figavto]b , a very good discrimination between set  a and set  c is possible over the whole hera-@xmath45 pseudorapidity interval .",

    "we found that unlike the @xmath81 production cross section the asymmetry does practically not depend on the charm quark mass ; if we vary the charm quark mass from 1.35 to 1.7 gev / c@xmath90 the magnitude of the asymmetry changes by about @xmath91 over the whole considered @xmath2 region .",
    "+ * in @xmath81 plus jet production * the study of the double spin asymmetry would allow to access directly the polarized gluon distribution function , similar to the case of _ photon plus jet _ production .",
