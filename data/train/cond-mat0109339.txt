    "schulz and shastry @xcite have introduced a new class of gauge coupled one - dimensional ( 1d ) fermi systems that are non fermi liquid in the sense that the momentum distribution function has a cusp at the fermi momentum @xmath0 rather than a jump as in a fermi liquid.@xcite this behavior is of the sort first found by luttinger in the context of his study of a one dimensional model that is popularly known as the luttinger model.@xcite the model introduced by schulz and shastry ( ss ) is in fact intimately connected to the luttinger model , and is best viewed as a reinterpretation of luttinger s original model as a gauge theory .",
    "particles of different species exert a mutual gauge potential on each other , and this is sufficient to destroy the fermi liquid .",
    "this model has the added property that the charge and spin correlations are unaffected by the interaction , owing to the `` gauge '' nature of interaction .",
    "the fermionic green s functions , however , are non trivial , and have characteristic singularities that are popularly known as the tomonaga - luttinger liquid behavior.@xcite the asymptotic long distance behavior of the one electron correlation function is known ( see below ) by one of several arguments , including luttinger s original one .",
    "our motivation in the present work is to compute the exact one electron green s function for the ss  model , utilizing our knowledge of the complete spectrum of the same , and using techniques familiar from anderson s treatment of the orthogonality catastrophe issue in the x - ray edge problem.@xcite this is of great interest since usually one does not have access to the exact green s function even in 1d , and one has to be content with the asymptotic behavior . for interpreting experiments , such as those on photoemission ,",
    "one wants to know more than just the asymptotics , and this possibility is realized here for the particular model of ss .",
    "we first write down the basic lattice fermi model in 1d , outline the pseudo unitary transformation that eliminates the gauge interactions in favor of a twisted boundary condition . using this transformation we formulate the problem of calculating the one electron green s function .",
    "let us write the model for two component electrons hopping and interacting via the hamiltonian @xmath1 )    c^\\dagger_{j,\\sigma } c^{\\phantom{\\dagger}}_{j+1,\\sigma } + { \\rm h.c . } \\",

    "( [ eq : hss ] ) into a simple hopping hamiltonian with twisted boundary conditions.@xcite to regain a translational invariant hamiltonian we apply a second unitary transformation @xmath3 the combined transformation @xmath4 commutes with @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is the translational operator which shifts one site to the right ( e.g. @xmath6 ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath7 on the fermion operators is @xmath8 while the density operators are invariant , @xmath9 , and the transformed hamiltonian @xmath10 reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density of @xmath13 spin fermions .",
    "thus we see that the transformed hopping has a `` dynamically generated '' gauge field . in the eigenvalue problem",
    "@xmath14 the eigenstates @xmath15 are products of noninteracting one - particle states with momenta @xmath16 created with @xmath17 operator , @xmath18 .",
    "the momenta are quantized as @xmath19 with @xmath20 integers .",
    "the total energy and momentum of the states is @xmath21 and the one - particle energy is @xmath22 thus we must have the eigenstates of @xmath23 @xmath24 with the energy and momentum given also by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ep ] ) . in the ground state",
    "the @xmath16 states between the fermi momenta @xmath25 and @xmath26 are filled ( @xmath27 ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the energy @xmath28 does not depend on @xmath29 and is equal with the energy of the noninteracting @xmath30 case . for finite size systems",
    "@xmath29 enters only through the @xmath31 corrections .",
    "our goal is to calculate the spectral functions , which we define as @xmath32 the local ( @xmath16 averaged ) spectral functions are defined as @xmath33 we concentrate on @xmath34 , since @xmath35 is calculated analogously .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , 1d interacting fermions behave as luttinger - liquids , which is characterized , among others , by the power - law behavior of correlation function for small energies . in our case , as we will see later , the main contribution for @xmath36 comes from @xmath37^{(\\alpha/\\pi)^2 } }     {   \\omega-\\varepsilon_f - u(k - k^{(-1)}_{\\uparrow } ) } +   c_1     \\frac {       \\left [          ( \\omega-\\varepsilon_f)^2-u^2(k - k^{(1)}_{\\uparrow})^2       \\right]^{(\\alpha/\\pi)^2 } }    {   \\omega-\\varepsilon_f+u(k - k^{(1)}_{\\uparrow } ) }    \\nonumber\\\\    & & +   c_2     \\frac{\\left[(\\omega-\\varepsilon_f)^2-u^2(k - k^{(1)}_{\\uparrow})^2\\right]^{(\\alpha/\\pi-1)^2 } } {   \\omega-\\varepsilon_f - u(k - k^{(1)}_{\\uparrow } ) }    + c_2     \\frac{\\left [       ( \\omega-\\varepsilon_f)^2-u^2(k - k^{(3)}_{\\uparrow})^2     \\right]^{(\\alpha/\\pi-1)^2 } }     { \\omega-\\varepsilon_f+u(k - k^{(3)}_{\\uparrow})}\\ , ,   \\label{eq : powakw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 are the ( fermi ) momenta of the singularities , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants and @xmath41 is the velocity of the excitations .",
    "usually in luttinger - liquids the velocities of the spin and charge excitations are different and they both appear in spectral functions . in our case , however , due to the gauge origin of the interaction , the spin and charge velocities are equal to the fermi velocity @xmath42 .",
    "the spectral function has a nonanalytical , branch cut structure near the fermi momenta , and finite weight appears for higher multiples of the fermi momenta ( @xmath43 ) . the local density of states near fermi energy reads @xmath44 which for the noninteracting @xmath30 reproduces the fermi - liquid step function .",
    "we now consider the exact evaluation of the spectral functions . as a preliminary to the discussion for general @xmath29 , let us note the special cases of @xmath30 and @xmath45 , where the spectral functions can be calculated more or less trivially .",
    "\\(i ) the @xmath30 case is nothing else but the usual tight binding hamiltonian @xmath46 of noninteracting electrons , as @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hss ] ) . for the spectral functions we recover the familiar @xmath48 i.e. a dirac - delta peak following the cosine - like dispersion of the free fermions .",
    "\\(ii ) when @xmath45 , the model actually corresponds to the electron - hole symmetric correlated hopping model@xcite with @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( the hopping amplitudes @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined in ref .  ):",
    "@xmath54 the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamcorrhop ] ) can be diagonalized with the help of a unitary transformation @xmath55 which is simpler than @xmath56 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u1 ] ) and ( [ eq : u2 ] ) , and it transforms the fermionic operators as @xmath57 so the transformed fermi operators remain `` local '' .",
    "furthermore , this transformation is not any more restricted to the 1d case .",
    "the evaluation of the matrix elements is now convenient for operators in site representation , and the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq : akw ] ) becomes @xmath58 where the @xmath59 creates fermion on site @xmath60 .",
    "next , we apply the canonical transformation to formulate the problem using the transformed wave function [ the analog of eq .",
    "( [ eq : canpsi ] ) ] , and for the spectral function we get @xmath61 the wave functions are product of the spin - up and spin - down part , the evaluation is straightforward and leads to @xmath62 and a similar equation gives @xmath63 . in the spectral",
    "function we can identify the following two distinct features : ( a ) a dirac - delta contribution following the cosine - like dispersion , which is the reminder of the noninteracting spectral function [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : akw0 ] ) ] suppressed by a factor of @xmath64 ; ( b ) a broader continuum coming from the propagator dressed with a single loop",
    ". as we increase the filling , the weight of the fermi jump for zero magnetization ( @xmath65 ) decreases as @xmath66 , and will disappear at half filling , leaving us with an @xmath67 density of states [ the @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aw_le ] ) for @xmath69 . to illustrate this behavior , we present the evolution of the local spectral functions with density in fig .",
    "( [ fig : abwpi ] ) .",
    "\\(iii ) general case : like in the previous case , in evaluating the matrix elements we use the site representation , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mesite ] ) .",
    "next , we apply the canonical transformation to formulate the problem using the transformed wave functions : @xmath70 where @xmath71 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : uu ] ) ] . as in the transformed basis",
    "the wave functions are product of the spin up and down free fermion wave functions , @xmath72 in the equation above the @xmath59 creates a fermion with energy @xmath73 and momentum @xmath74 , in which case the matrix element is @xmath75 .",
    "this allows us to write the spectral function as a convolution @xmath76 with @xmath77 the interesting and nontrivial part of the calculation comes from the @xmath78 .",
    "this can be easily accomplished after the observation that translating the operator @xmath79 a similar factor appears : @xmath80 .",
    "so @xmath81 next , we note that @xmath82 , and we end up with @xmath83 to evaluate @xmath84 , we replace @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    ". then we move @xmath79 to the right across @xmath87 s so that it acts to the vacuum , @xmath88 .",
    "however , as @xmath89 , the @xmath16 momenta are shifted by @xmath90 ( this is equivalent to twisting the boundary conditions ) : @xmath91 here we have to calculate overlap of free fermion wave functions with different phase shifts due to the removal of a @xmath92-spin fermion .",
    "this problem arises e.g. in the x - ray edge problem ( andersons s orthogonality catastrophe@xcite ) , and the one - dimensional analog was discussed in ref .  .",
    "for the reader s convenience , we repeat here the main points .",
    "the anticommutation relation between the operators with different phase shifts reads @xmath93 the overlap of the wave functions can be further calculated as @xmath94 : @xmath95 this determinant is actually a cauchy determinant and can be expressed as a product , so we end up with @xmath96 for the special @xmath30 [ where @xmath97 and @xmath45 cases , taking the suitable limits , we recover the the results of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : akw0 ] ) and ( [ eq : abpi ] ) , respectively . in the @xmath45 case",
    "the phase shift equals @xmath98 , which is exactly the spacing between two adjacent @xmath16 value .",
    "thus the orthogonality catastrophe is absent .",
    "following the same approach , for the photoemission part we get @xmath99 with @xmath100    the product in eq .",
    "( [ eq : product ] ) can be evaluated numerically and spectral functions for relatively large system can be obtained .",
    "the numerical result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : abwkevol ] for some large size systems . starting from @xmath30",
    ", we observe that there is an overall shift in momentum proportional to @xmath101 ( which we compensated for in the figure ) , and that apart of the main contribution , which follows the cosine - like dispersion , additional continuum - like features appear .",
    "finally , for even larger values of @xmath29 another cosine - like feature appears with a considerable weight .    alternatively",
    ", for the low energy part further analytical considerations can be applied.@xcite starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : product ] ) , the weights of the peaks can be expressed via @xmath102 functions in the @xmath103 limit , leading to the power - law behavior of the luttinger liquid spectral function , and the exponents can be associated with the phase shift .",
    "we find singularities where the momenta of the final state are closely packed .",
    "these happen at @xmath104 with @xmath105 an odd integer .",
    "the most important ones for small @xmath29 are with @xmath106 , which coincides with the fermi momenta @xmath107 . as we can follow in fig .",

    "( [ eq : powakw ] ) .",
    "the values of the exponents are tabulated for some selected @xmath29 in table .",
    "[ tbl : exp ] .    the weight transfer can be quantified by observing the sum rules .",
    "while the zeroth momentum is constant , @xmath114 the first already shows the large weight transferred to energies far from the fermi energy : @xmath115     | {",

    "we have presented the exact one electron green s function for a model fermi system in 1d with a non fermi liquid behavior for essentially any value of the interaction strength .",
    "a few exact analytical calculations of the spectral function for model systems , such as the @xmath116 exchange t - j model , with a projection to single occupancy are available in literature.@xcite the green s function for this system obtained here does require some numerics , and is not totally analytical .",
    "however unlike the situation in projected models , such as the t - j model , it satisfies the sum rules familiar from text books for weakly interacting fermi liquids ( e.g. the complete electron sum rule with large @xmath117 behavior of @xmath118 as 1/ @xmath117 ) .",
