    "since the discovery @xcite in 1970s , the surprisingly large transverse polarization of hyperons in unpolarized high energy hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus collisions has been a standing hot topic in high energy spin physics ( see e.g , @xcite , and the references cited therein . ) .",
    "experimentally , there are a large number of similar experiments that have been performed at different energies and/or using different projectiles and/or targets and for the production of different hyperons @xcite .",
    "theoretically , different models have been proposed @xcite , the aim of which is to understand the origin(s ) of this striking spin effect in high energy reactions .",
    "clearly such studies should provide us with useful information on the spin structure of the hadron and the spin dependence of strong interactions .",
    "inspired by the similarities of the corresponding data @xcite , we proposed a new approach in a recent letter @xcite to understand the origin(s ) of the transverse hyperon polarization in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions by relating them to the left - right asymmetries observed @xcite in singly polarized @xmath0 collisions .",
    "we pointed out that these two striking spin phenomena should be closely related to each other and have the same origin(s ) .",
    "we showed that using the spin correlation deduced from the single - spin left - right asymmetries for inclusive @xmath4 production as input , we can naturally understand the transverse polarization for a hyperon which has one valence quark in common with the projectile , such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 in @xmath0 collisions , or @xmath8 in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "we showed also that , to understand the puzzling transverse polarization of @xmath8 in @xmath0 collisions , which have two valence quarks in common with the projectile , we need to assume that the @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which combine respectively with the valence-(@xmath11 ) diquark and the remaining @xmath12-valence quark to form the produced @xmath8 and the associatively produced @xmath13 in the fragmentation region , should have opposite spins . under this assumption",
    ", we obtained a good quantitative fit to the @xmath14 dependence of @xmath8 polarization in @xmath0 collisions ( where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the longitudinal component of the momentum of the produced hyperon , and @xmath17 is the total center of mass energy of the @xmath0 system ) .",
    "the obtained qualitative features for the polarizations of other hyperons are all in good agreement with the available data .",
    "there are two main points in the picture that need to be further tested , i.e. , ( i ) the @xmath9 and @xmath10 that combine respectively with the valence-(@xmath11 ) diquark and the remaining @xmath12-valence quark of the projectile proton to form the produced @xmath8 and the associatively produced @xmath13 in the fragmentation region have opposite spins , and ( ii ) the su(6 ) wave function can be used to describe the relation between the spin of the fragmenting quark and that of the hadron produced in the fragmentation process .",
    "developments have been made since the publication of ref .",
    "we found out that exclusive reactions such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 are best suitable to test point ( i ) .",
    "we therefore applied the picture to these processes and presented the obtained results in refs . @xcite and",
    "it is encouraging to see that these results are all in agreement with the available data @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out @xcite that the longitudinal polarization of @xmath8 in @xmath20 annihilation at @xmath21 pole provides a special test to point ( ii ) , i.e. , whether su(6 ) wave function can be used in relating the spin of the fragmenting quark to that of the produced hadron .",
    "calculations have been made @xcite and the obtained results are consistent with the data @xcite . since neither the accuracy nor the abundance of the data is high enough to give a conclusive judgment",
    ", we made a systematic study @xcite of hyperon polarization in other reactions which can be used to test this point .",
    "the results are in agreement with the available data @xcite and future experiments are under way .    encouraged by these developments , in this paper , we apply the proposed picture to study the polarizations of different hyperons in different unpolarized hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus reactions .",
    "we summarize the different ingredients of the picture and their developments in detail in sec . [",
    "sec : picture ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we give the calculation method of hyperon polarization in different processes using the picture . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we apply the method to calculate the polarizations of different hyperons produced in unpolarized @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath22 , and @xmath3 collisions . we present the results obtained and compare them with the available data .",
    "finally , a short summary and outlook is given in sec .",
    "in this section , we summarize the key points of the picture proposed in ref .",
    "the basic idea of the picture is that there should be a close relation between hyperon polarization ( @xmath23 ) in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions and the left - right asymmetry ( @xmath24 ) in single - spin hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "hence , if we extract the essential information encoded in the @xmath24 data , we can study @xmath23 based on such information .",
    "there are three key points in this physical picture which are summarized as the following .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the existence of @xmath24 in singly polarized hadron - hadron collision implies the existence of a spin correlation between the spin of the fragmenting quark and the direction of momentum of the produced hadron , i.e. , @xmath25 type of spin correlation in the reaction .",
    "[ here , @xmath26 is the spin of the quark ; @xmath27 is the unit vector in the normal direction of the production plane , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the momentum of the incident hadron and that of the produced hadron . ]",
    "one of the major ingredients of the picture proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is that both the existence of @xmath24 and that of @xmath23 are different manifestations of this spin correlation @xmath25 .",
    "hence we can use the experimental results for @xmath24 as input to determine the strength of this spin correlation , then apply it to unpolarized hadron - hadron collision to study @xmath23 .",
    "we recall that @xcite , in the language commonly used in describing @xmath24 , the polarization direction of the incident proton is called upward , and the incident direction is forward .",
    "the single - spin left - right asymmetry @xmath24 is just the difference between the cross section where @xmath29 points to the left and that to the right , which corresponds to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the data @xcite on @xmath24 show that if a hadron is produced by an upward polarized valence quark of the projectile , it has a large probability to have a transverse momentum pointing to the left .",
    "@xmath24 measures the excess of hadrons produced to the left over those produced to the right .",
    "the difference of the probability for the hadron to go left and that to go right is denoted @xcite by @xmath32 if the hadron is produced by an upward polarized quark .",
    "@xmath32 is a constant in the range of @xmath33 .",
    "it has been shown that @xcite , to fit the @xmath24 data @xcite in the transverse momentum interval @xmath34 gev/@xmath35 , @xmath32 should be taken as @xmath36 .    in terms of the spin correlation",
    "discussed above , the cross section should be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are independent of @xmath26 .",
    "the second term just denotes the existence of the @xmath25 type of spin correlation .",
    "@xmath32 is just the difference between the cross section where @xmath30 and that where @xmath31 divided by the sum of them , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "now , we assume the same strength for the spin correlation in hyperon production in the same collisions .",
    "it follows that the quark which fragments into the hyperon should be polarized , and the polarization @xmath41 can be determined by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "since both the left - right asymmetry in singly polarized collision and hyperon polarization in unpolarized collision exist mainly in large @xmath14 region , we assume that the spin correlation exists only for valence quarks of the incident hadrons . for a hyperon produced with momentum @xmath29 , @xmath42 is given .",
    "the cross section that this hyperon is produced in the fragmentation of a valence quark with spin satisfying @xmath30 is @xmath43 , and that with spin satisfying @xmath31 is @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the polarization of the valence quarks which lead to the production of the hyperons with that @xmath42 is given by , @xmath45    it should be emphasized that @xmath46 just means that the strength of the spin correlation of the form @xmath25 is nonzero in the reaction .",
    "it means that , due to some spin - dependent interactions , the quarks which have spins along the same direction as the normal of the production plane have a large probability to combine with suitable sea quarks to form the specified hyperons than those which have spins in the opposite direction .",
    "it does not imply that the quarks in the unpolarized incident hadrons were polarized in a given direction , which would contradict the general requirement of space rotation invariance .",
    "in fact , in an unpolarized reaction , the normal of the production plane of the specified hyperons is uniformly distributed in the transverse directions .",
    "hence , averaging over all the normal directions , the quarks are unpolarized .",
    "we would like also to mention that similar idea has been applied @xcite to spin alignments of vector mesons in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "it has been shown that the existence of the spin alignment of vector mesons in unpolarized hadron - hadron collision is another manifestation of the existence of the @xmath47 type of spin correlation .",
    "the obtained result are in agreement with the available data @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the above - mentioned subsection , the existence of the @xmath25 type of spin correlation in hadron - hadron collision implies a polarization of the quark @xmath48 transverse to the production plane of the hyperon .",
    "( here , we use the superscript @xmath49 to denote the quark before fragmentation . ) to study the polarization of the produced hyperon from this point , we need to know the relation between the spin of the quark and that of the hadron produced in the fragmentation of this quark . the question of the relation between the spin of the fragmenting quark @xmath48 and that of the hadron created in the fragmentation of @xmath48 is usually referred to as `` spin transfer in high energy fragmentation process '' .",
    "it contains two parts : will @xmath48 keep its polarization in the fragmentation ?",
    "what is the relation between the spin of @xmath48 and that of the hadron which contains @xmath48 ?",
    "the answers to these questions depend on the spin structure of hadron and the hadronization mechanism .",
    "they can even be different in the longitudinally polarized case from those for the transversely polarized case .",
    "since neither of them can be solved using perturbative calculations , presently , phenomenological studies are need to search the answers to them .",
    "currently , there exist two distinct pictures for the spin structure of nucleon , i.e. , the su(6 ) picture based on the su(6 ) wave function of the baryon , and the dis picture based on the polarized deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering data and other inputs such as symmetry assumptions and data from other experiments .",
    "it is of particular interest to know which one is suitable here .",
    "it is clear that to study these questions , one needs to know the polarization of the quark before fragmentation and measure the polarization of the hadron produced in the fragmentation .",
    "hence , we have the following two possibilities : one is to study hyperon polarization in @xmath20 annihilation at @xmath21 pole , in polarized @xmath50 deeply inelastic scattering or in high @xmath51 polarized @xmath0 collision .",
    "the other is to study the vector meson polarization in these processes .",
    "it has been pointed out that the @xmath8 polarization in @xmath20 annihilation at the @xmath21 pole provides a very special test to the applicability of the su(6 ) picture in the longitudinally polarized case .",
    "this is because , for @xmath52 , the @xmath53 created at the @xmath20 annihilation vertex is almost completely longitudinally polarized . in this case , if we assume that the quark keeps its polarization in the fragmentation and use the su(6 ) wave function to connect the spin of the quark and that of the hyperon that contains this quark , we should obtain a maximum for the magnitude of @xmath8 polarization since in this picture the spin of the @xmath9-quark is completely transferred to @xmath8 .",
    "experimental data were obtained @xcite for @xmath54 by the aleph and opal collaborations at lep .",
    "we showed @xcite that if we assume that the @xmath48 keeps its polarization in fragmentation and the su(6 ) wave function can be used in relating the polarization of @xmath48 and that of the produced hyperon which contains @xmath48 , we obtain the results which are in agreement with the data .",
    "this result is rather encouraging .",
    "but , the accuracy and abundance of the data are not enough to make a conclusive judgment .",
    "in particular , there is no direct measurement available at all in the transversely polarized case .",
    "we therefore made a systematic calculation for hyperon polarizations in all the different reactions @xcite .",
    "there are also data for @xmath8 polarization in deeply inelastic scattering @xcite , they are also consistent with the results obtained using the su(6 ) picture",
    ".    there are also data that provide information on vector meson polarization in high energy reactions .",
    "the @xmath55-elements of the helicity density matrices for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , etc in @xmath58 have been measured @xcite by the aleph , delphi and opal collaborations at lep .",
    "we showed @xcite that these data can also be understood using the su(6 ) picture .",
    "further tests , not only in the longitudinally polarized case but also in the transversely polarized case , are under way . in this paper , we assume it is the same in longitudinally and transversely polarized cases and use it in studying hyperon polarization in unpolarized high energy hadron - hadron collisions .    having the two points discussed in the last and this subsections , we can already obtain the polarizations for those hyperons which have one valence quark of the same flavor as that of the projectile , e.g. , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . some of the qualitative features of the results are given in ref .",
    "it is encouraging to see that all of them are in good agreement with the data @xcite .      to study",
    "the polarization of hyperons such as @xmath8 in @xmath66 , i.e. , those which have two valence quarks that have the same flavors as those of the projectile , we encounter the following question : if a hadron is produced by two valence quarks ( valence diquark ) @xmath67 of the projectile , the remaining valence quark @xmath65 produces an associated hadron .",
    "what are the spin states of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 that combine with the @xmath67 and the remaining @xmath65 to form the produced hyperon and the associatively produced meson in the fragmentation region , respectively ?    theoretically , it is quite difficult to derive it since we are in the very small @xmath68 region ; the production of such pairs is also of soft nature in general and can not be calculated using perturbative theory .",
    "to get some clue to this problem , we still start from the single - spin left - right asymmetry @xmath24 .",
    "the existing data @xcite clearly show that @xmath24 in @xmath69 is large in magnitude and negative in sign in the fragmentation region .",
    "we note that the @xmath8 in this region is mainly produced by the valence-@xmath70-diquark of the projectile and is associated with the production of a @xmath13 produced by the remaining @xmath71 . from the su(6 ) wave function we learn that the @xmath70 has to be in the spin zero state and the spin of the proton is carried by the remaining @xmath71 .",
    "according to the @xmath25 spin correlation discussed in subsection [ subsec : a ] , @xmath24 for the associatively produced @xmath13 is positive .",
    "hence , to understand the data on @xmath24 for @xmath8 , we simply need to assume @xcite that @xmath8 produced by @xmath70 and @xmath13 that is associatively produced by the remaining @xmath71 move in the opposite transverse directions , which is just a direct consequence of transverse momentum conservation .",
    "now , we apply this to unpolarized @xmath0 collision and consider the case that a @xmath8 is produced by @xmath70 together with a @xmath9-quark and a @xmath13 is associatively produced by the remaining @xmath71 together with the @xmath10 . according to the @xmath25 spin correlation mentioned in subsection [ subsec : a ]",
    ", the remaining @xmath71 should have a large probability to be polarized in @xmath72 direction since the normal of the production plane for the @xmath13 is opposite to the normal @xmath42 of the production plane of @xmath8 .",
    "the polarization is @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath13 is a spin zero object , the @xmath10 should have a polarization of @xmath74 ( in the @xmath42 direction ) .",
    "the data for @xmath8 polarization show that @xmath75 is large and negative .",
    "this means that the @xmath9-quark has a negative polarization .",
    "we thus reach the conclusion that , to understand the polarization of @xmath8 in @xmath76 , we need to assume that the @xmath9 and @xmath10 have opposite spins . under this assumption , together with the two points mentioned in the last two subsections , we obtained @xcite a good fit to the data on @xmath8 polarization .",
    "this point needs of course to be further studied and tested experimentally .",
    "we found out that the simple exclusive process are most suitable for this purpose .",
    "hyperon polarizations in the exclusive processes such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 are very sensitive to the spin states of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 pairs .",
    "if the @xmath9 and @xmath10 have opposite spins , the obtained results for @xmath8 polarization in @xmath18 should take the maximum among the different channels for @xmath66 .",
    "this is because that here we have a situation that the @xmath8 is definitely produced by the @xmath70 valence diquark and is definitely associated with a @xmath13 that is definitely produced by the remaining @xmath71 of the incident @xmath77 .",
    "hence , we obtain that in this case , @xmath78 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the data obtained @xcite by the r608 collaboration at cern which show that @xmath79 .",
    "we also calculated @xcite @xmath8 polarization in @xmath19 in all three cases in which the spin states of @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be , i.e. , opposite , same or uncorrelated .",
    "we found out that the results in the three cases are quite different from each other .",
    "now , experimental data are obtained @xcite for @xmath8 polarization in @xmath19 by the clas collaboration at jefferson laboratory . comparing to the data",
    ", we see that the results obtained in the case that the spins of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are opposite are favored .",
    "further tests are also under way .",
    "we now assume that this is in general true , i.e. , the @xmath62 that combines with the @xmath64 of the projectile to form the hyperon and the @xmath63 that combines with the remaining @xmath65 to form the associatively produced meson have opposite spins .",
    "under this assumption , we obtain the result that the @xmath62 should be polarized in the @xmath80 direction and the polarization is @xmath73 .",
    "we apply this to the production of different hyperons to calculate the hyperon polarizations in unpolarized high energy hadron - hadron or hadron - nucleus collisions in next sections .",
    "we emphasize that the above mentioned result is true for the production of hyperons associated with the production of pseudo - scalar mesons .",
    "the situation should be different if the associatively produced meson is a vector meson .",
    "this influence will be further investigated in a separate paper @xcite and here we consider only the former case .",
    "having the picture discussed in last section , we can calculate the hyperon polarization in different hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "we now present the formulas used in these calculations .",
    "we consider the process @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote respectively the projectile and target hadron , and @xmath84 denotes the @xmath85th kind of the hyperons .",
    "the hyperon polarization @xmath86 is defined as , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number density of @xmath84 s polarized in the same ( @xmath89 ) or opposite ( @xmath90 ) direction as the normal ( @xmath42 ) of the production plane at a given @xmath17 ; @xmath91 , @xmath16 is the longitudinal momentum of @xmath84 with respect to the incident direction of @xmath82 , and @xmath17 is the total c.m .",
    "energy of the colliding hadron system .",
    "it is clear that the denominator is nothing else but the number density of @xmath84 without specifying the polarization .    to calculate @xmath92 , we divide the final hyperons @xmath84 s into the following four groups according to the different origins for the production : ( a ) those directly produced and contain a valence diquark ( two valence quarks ) @xmath93 of the projectile ; ( b ) those directly produced and contain a valence quark @xmath94 of the projectile ; ( c ) those from the decay of the directly produced heavier hyperons @xmath95 s that contain a @xmath93 or a @xmath94 ; and ( d ) the others . in this way",
    ", we have , @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 denote the contributions from groups ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ; the superscript @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote the flavor of @xmath65 and the type of @xmath95 , respectively ; @xmath102 is the contribution from ( d ) .",
    "according to the picture discussed in last section , hyperons from groups ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) can be polarized , while those from ( d ) are not .",
    "this means that those from ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) contribute to the numerator @xmath103 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) , i.e. , we have , @xmath104    since valence quarks usually carry large fractions of the momenta of the incident hadrons , we expect that , for very large @xmath14 , @xmath97 dominates . for small @xmath14 , @xmath102 dominates , while for moderate @xmath14 , @xmath105 plays the dominant role . hence ,",
    "if we neglect the decay contributions , we expect from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : define][eq : deltan ] ) that @xmath106 has the following general properties . for @xmath14 increasing from 0 to 1 , it starts from 0 , increases to @xmath107 , and finally tends to @xmath108 at @xmath109 .",
    "we will come to this point in next section for particular hyperon in the specified reaction .",
    "we now first discuss the calculations of all these @xmath110 s , @xmath111 s and @xmath102 in the following .",
    "the contributions of hyperons from the different groups discussed above are entirely determined by the hadronization mechanisms in unpolarized case .",
    "they are independent of the polarization of the hadrons .",
    "we can calculate them using a hadronization model that gives a good description of the unpolarized data . for this purpose , the simple model used in refs .",
    "@xcite is a very practical choice . in this model ,",
    "hyperons from groups ( a ) and ( b ) are described as the products of the following `` direct - formation '' or `` direct - fusion '' process . for ( a ) , it is , @xmath112 and for ( b ) , it is , @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 denote a sea quark or a sea diquark from the target .",
    "the number densities of the hyperons produced in these processes are determined by the number densities of the initial partons .",

    "since most of the decay process @xmath126 that we consider are two body decay , @xmath99 can be calculated from a convolution of @xmath127 or @xmath128 with the distribution describing the decay process .",
    "the calculations are in principle straightforward , but in practice a little bit complicated and detailed information of the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath95 is needed .",
    "since the influence is not very large , we , for simplicity , use the following approximation .",
    "we neglect the distribution caused by the decay process and take the average value for @xmath14 instead .",
    "more precisely , we take @xmath129 as an example ( where @xmath130 denotes a meson ) . for a @xmath95 with a given longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath131 , the resulting @xmath14 of",
    "the produced @xmath84 can take different values .",
    "the distribution of @xmath14 at a fixed @xmath131 can be obtained from the isotropic distribution of the momenta of the decay products in the rest frame of @xmath95 .",
    "this can be calculated if the transverse momentum of @xmath95 is also given .",
    "the average value of the resulting @xmath14 has a simple expression , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the energy of @xmath84 in the rest frame of @xmath95 .",
    "we see that @xmath134 is independent of the transverse momentum of @xmath95 . in our calculations",

    "@xcite , this mechanism plays the dominating role in large @xmath14 region such as @xmath140 .",
    "it is clear that nobody knows _ a priori _ whether the quark distribution functions can be used in describing the quark - fusion process which leads to the hadrons in the fragmentation region with moderately large @xmath51 .",
    "the applicability follows from the empirical facts pointed out by ochs @xcite , and the phenomenological works by das and hwa @xcite long time ago .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that various experiments have shown that the longitudinal momentum distributions of the produced hadrons in the fragmentation region are very much similar to those of the corresponding valence quarks in the colliding hadrons .",
    "the model follows directly from this observation .",
    "it is interesting to note that this simple model not only is consistent with the observation @xcite of ochs already in 1977 and the theoretical works @xcite by das and hwa , but also has experienced a number of tests such as isospin invariance of @xmath102 etc ( for a summary , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore",
    ", the energy dependence that is contained in @xmath110 due to the energy dependence of @xmath141 leads @xcite naturally the energy dependence of the single - spin left - right asymmetry @xmath24 observed @xcite by the bnl e925 collaboration compared with those by the fermilab e704 collaboration .",

    "the quark distributions are taken from the parametrization at low @xmath142 such as @xmath143 gev/@xmath35 .",

    "another very important aspect is the transverse momentum dependence of the hyperon polarization .",

    "[ sec : method ] can be extended to include the @xmath51-dependence .",
    "we can use them to calculate the @xmath51-dependence of @xmath23 in the model .",
    "this is also a very important aspect in the existing data and should be taken as a further challenge to the model . as can be seen from the formulae in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , the @xmath51-dependence of @xmath23 should come from the @xmath51-dependence of @xmath32 , and the interplay of the @xmath51-dependent @xmath102 and @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath51-dependance of the direct formation contribution @xmath110 comes mainly from those of the quark distributions .",
    "the @xmath102 part can be parameterized from the data on unpolarized cross sections .",
    "but , to get the @xmath51-dependence of @xmath32 , we need the data on the @xmath51-dependence of @xmath24 .",
    "presently , there is no such data available .",
    "we get only an average @xmath32 in the @xmath51 interval @xmath34 gev/@xmath35 .",
    "this is the largest difficulty to calculate the @xmath51-dependence of @xmath23 at the present stage .",
    "nevertheless , a phenomenological analysis can and should be made .",
    "such studies are under way .",
    "the results we obtained in sec . [ sec : results ] should be taken as the average results in the corresponding @xmath51-region .",
    "since many of the data are from fixed angle experiments , the comparison of our results with the data can only be regarded as qualitative .",
