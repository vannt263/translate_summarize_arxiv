    "the precision of 3d stereovision applications is intimately related to the precision of the camera calibration , and especially of the camera distortion correction .",
    "an imprecise distortion model produces residual distortion that will be directly back - projected to the reconstructed 3d scene .",
    "such imprecision can be a serious hindrance in remote sensing applications such as the early warnings of geology disasters , or in the construction of topographic maps from stereographic pairs of aerial photographs .",
    "the fast growing resolution of digital cameras and of their optical quality is transforming them into ( potential ) high precision measurement tools .",
    "thus , it becomes important to measure the calibration precision with ever higher precision .    a first step toward high - precision distortion corrections is to perform precise distortion measurements .",
    "this basic tool can then be used to evaluate the precision of a correction method , or can become part of the correction method itself .    camera and lens distortion measurement methods usually require a flat pattern containing aligned elements .",
    "the pattern is photographed using the target lens , and the distortion is measured by how much the observed elements deviate from the straight alignment on the pattern .",
    "for example the classic dxo - labs software , a good representative of camera maker practice , ( http://www.dxo.com/ ) uses a pattern with a grid of aligned dots .",
    "distortion is measured by the positional errors associated with the maximal deviation in a row , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dxo_distortion ] . similar methods are proposed by the smia , ebu , ie , and i3a standards .",
    "these measurements are generally manual and require a perfectly flat pattern .",
    "every lens distortion correction method includes , implicitly , a lens distortion measurement .",
    "these methods can be roughly classified into four groups :    * re - projection error minimization methods ; * pattern matching methods ; * enlarged epipolar geometry based methods ; * plumb - line methods .    re - projection methods usually rely on a planar pattern containing simple geometric shapes . in these methods",
    ", the lens distortion is estimated together with the camera internal and external parameters @xcite , by minimizing the re - projection error between the observed control points on the pattern and the re - projected control points simulated by the pattern model and camera model .",
    "the distortion is measured in terms of re - projection error once all the parameters have been estimated .",
    "both the internal parameter errors and the external parameter errors contribute to the re - projection error .",
    "unfortunately , these errors can compensate each other .",
    "thus , a small re - projection error may be observed while the internal and external parameters are not well estimated .",
    "this compensation effect reduces the precision of the estimation of the lens distortion parameters @xcite .",
    "it hinders accurate distortion estimation from the re - projection error .",
    "notice that this high precision is not always required . in some applications ,",
    "the distortion estimated in these bundle adjustment based re - projection methods , which makes the 3d geometry consistent with the pin - hole model , is precise enough for human observer .    a quite different kind of method proceeds by matching a photograph of a flat pattern to its digital model .",
    "these methods estimate the distortion field by interpolating a continuous distortion field from a set of matching points .",
    "several variants exist depending on the kind of pattern , matching and interpolation technique .",
    "a common and crucial assumption for these methods is that the pattern is flat . in practice , however , it is difficult to produce a very flat pattern , and the consequences of a tiny flatness flaw are considerable .",
    "for example it is reported in @xcite that a flatness error of about 100  @xmath1 m for a 40 centimeters broad pattern can lead to an error of about @xmath2 pixels in the distortion field computation for a canon eos 30d camera of focal length @xmath3  mm with the distance between the camera and the object about @xmath4  cm . the only physical method to assess a pattern flatness at a high precision is interferometry , but it requires the pattern to be a mirror , which is not adequate for photography .",
    "furthermore , camera calibration requires large patterns , which are therefore flexible .",
    "deformations of the order of 100  @xmath1 m or more can be caused by temperature changes , and by a mere position change of the pattern , which deforms under its own weight .",
    "recently , more attention has been paid to pattern - free methods ( or self - calibration methods ) where the distortion estimation is obtained without using any specific pattern .",
    "the distortion is estimated from the correspondences between two or several images in absence of any camera information .",
    "the main tool is the so - called enlarged epipolar constraint , which incorporates lens distortion into the epipolar geometry .",
    "some iterative @xcite or non - iterative methods @xcite are used to estimate the distortion and correct it by minimizing an algebraic error .",
    "the estimated distortion can be used as the initialization in bundle adjustment methods to improve the camera calibration precision @xcite .",
    "the so called `` plumb - line '' methods , which correct the distortion by rectifying distorted images of 3d straight lines , date back to the 1970s ( see brown s seminal paper in 1971 @xcite ) .",
    "since then , this idea has been applied to many distortion models : the radial model @xcite , the fov ( field of view ) model @xcite , or the rational function model @xcite .",
    "these methods minimize the straightness error of the corrected lines . according to the fundamental theorem to be introduced in section  [ sec : theorem ]",
    ", the plumb - line methods minimize an error directly related to the distortion , without suffering from the above mentioned drawback , namely a numerical error compensation .",
    "on the other hand , in spite of their name , current digital plumb - line methods usually involve flat patterns with alignments on them and not the plumb lines that were originally proposed in analog photogrammetry .",
    "taken literally , these methods should use photographs of 3d straight lines .",
    "when a high precision is required , this setup becomes much easier to build than a flat pattern .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to show that very accurate distortion evaluation and correction can be obtained with a basic plumb line tool which we called `` calibration harp '' .",
    "the calibration harp is nothing but a frame supporting tightly stretched strings .",
    "nevertheless , the photographs of a calibration harp require a new numerical treatment to exploit them .",
    "the strings will have to be detected at high sub - pixel accuracy and their distortion converted into an invariant measurement .",
    "distortion measurements can be used to evaluate the distortion of a camera , but also its residual distortion after correction .",
    "two aspects of the measurement should be clarified here . in this paper",
    "we discuss distortion measurements that apply to the camera conceived as a whole : it is impossible to tell which part the relative position and deformation of the ccd , and the lens distortion itself play in the global camera distortion .",
    "the distortion measurement is therefore not a pure optical lens distortion measurement , but the distortion measurement of the full acquisition system of camera+lens in a given state .",
    "different lenses on different cameras can be compared only when the camera calibration matrix is known . on the other hand ,",
    "the residual error due to different correction algorithms can be compared objectively after applying an appropriate normalization on the corrected images .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the fundamental theorem characterizing undistorted cameras is introduced in section  [ sec : theorem ] .",
    "section  [ sec : harp_building ] uncovers the simple fabrication secrets of calibration harps .",
    "the image processing algorithms needed for an automatic measurement are presented in section  [ sec : edge_detection ] and section  [ sec : measurements ] introduces the two most relevant measures .",
    "section  [ sec : applications ] demonstrates two applications , to the measurement of residual distortion after applying a calibration method , and to the transformation of existing manual distortion correction methods into automatic and far more precise ones .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in multiple - view geometry , the pinhole camera is the ideal model that all techniques tend to approximate at best by calibrating the real cameras .",
    "this model corresponds to the ideal geometric perspective projection .",
    "the next theorem characterizes perspective projections by the fact that they preserve alignments . instead of restating the simplified version in @xcite",
    ", we prefer to make it more precise .",
    "the proof of the theorem can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ theo : fundamental_prop ] _ let @xmath5 be a continuous map from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ( from 3d projective space to 2d projective plane ) .",
    "if there is a point @xmath8 such that : _    1 .",
    "the images of any three point belonging to a line in @xmath6 not containing @xmath8 , are aligned points in @xmath7 ; 2 .",
    "the images of any two points belonging to a line in @xmath6 containing @xmath8 , are the same point in @xmath7 ; 3 .",
    "there are at least four points belonging to a plane not containing @xmath8 , such that any group of three of them are non aligned , and their images are non aligned either ;    then @xmath5 is a pinhole camera with center @xmath8 .",
    "this theorem provides us with a fundamental tool to verify that a camera follows the pinhole model .",
    "nevertheless , _ rectifying straight lines does not define a unique distortion correction _ : two corrections can differ by any 2d homography that preserves all alignments . more concretely ,",
    "assume that the real camera model is @xmath9 $ ] with @xmath8 the coordinate of camera optic center in a given 3d world frame , @xmath10 the camera @xmath11 orientation matrix , @xmath12 the camera @xmath11 calibration matrix and @xmath13 the camera lens non - linear distortion .",
    "the estimated distortion can be written as @xmath14 with @xmath15 the unknown homography introduced in the distortion correction and can be different from one correction algorithm to another . by applying the inverse of the estimated distortion , the recovered pinhole camera is @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the homography @xmath17 can enlarge or reduce the straightness error , which makes the comparison of different correction algorithms unfair .",
    "this effect can be compensated by two strategies .",
    "to arrive at a universal measurement , a first strategy that we will consider is to normalize the homography :    1 .",
    "select four points @xmath18 in the distorted image in general position ( not three of them aligned ) .",
    "for example , they can be the four corners of the distorted image .",
    "2 .   find their corresponding points @xmath19 in the corrected image , according to the correction model : @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath17 is different from one correction algorithm to another .",
    "3 .   compute the normalization homography @xmath21 which maps @xmath19 to @xmath22 : @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath21 is different from one correction algorithm to another .",
    "4 .   apply the normalization homography @xmath21 on the corrected image .    with this normalization ,",
    "the final correction model is @xmath24 .",
    "a second possible strategy would be to fix specific parameters in the correction model .",
    "for example , since the zoom factor in the distortion correction is mainly determined by the order-@xmath25 parameters in the correction model , it is sufficient to set all the order-@xmath25 parameters to be @xmath25 to obtain a unique distortion measurement",
    ". unfortunately , this will not be possible for some non - parametric distortion correction methods .",
    "the first strategy therefore is more general .",
    "theorem [ theo : fundamental_prop ] suggests to take a set of physical straight lines , as a calibration pattern .",
    "however , a common practice actually contradicts the plumb - line basic idea : line patterns are printed and pasted over a flat plate .",
    "there are many sources of imprecision in this setup : the printer quality is not perfect ; the paper thickness is not perfectly uniform ; the pasting process can add bubbles or a non uniform glue layer ; the supporting surface is not perfectly flat either .",
    "notwithstanding these defects , if only a pixel precision is required , this setup is quite sufficient . nonetheless ,",
    "when high sub - pixel precision is involved , the flatness errors can not be neglected . for current camera precision , a flatness error of 100  @xmath1 m ( the thickness of current writing paper ) for a @xmath26  cm pattern can lead to errors in the observed image coordinates of about @xmath2 pixels @xcite .",
    "high precision aims at final 3d reconstructions far more precise than this .",
    "so the measuring tool error should be also far smaller , if only possible .",
    "the obvious advantage of `` real '' plumb lines on 2d patterns with straight lines on them , is that it is much easier to ensure a very precise physical straightness for lines than a very precise physical flatness for a physical pattern plate . yet",
    ", the precision of the resulting measurement or correction depends on the straightness of the physical lines . in @xcite , to achieve a high precision , plumb lines were made of very fine white thread and stabilized by immersion of the plumb bobs in oil containers .",
    "illumination was provided by a pair of vertically mounted fluorescent fixtures .",
    "a dead black background was provided for the plumb - line array to highlight the contrast .",
    "the points on the lines were measured with a microscope .",
    "the measuring process required from 5 to 6 hours for generating 324 points .",
    "the digital procedure proposed here will be automatic and faster .    for the applications where the precision is not a crucial point , straight lines present in the natural scene can be used . in @xcite ,",
    "the straight lines are obtained by photographing the architectural scenes and points on the lines are detected by canny edge detector .     +    in order to keep the high precision and simplify the fabrication procedure , we built a simple calibration pattern by tightly stretching strings on a frame as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : harp1 ] .",
    "the pattern looks like the musical instrument , hence its name .",
    "the setup warrants the physical straightness of the lines .",
    "its construction does not require any experimental skill , but only good quality strings .",
    "indeed twisted strings show local width oscillations ; other strings do not have a round section , and a little torsion also results in width variations that can have a large spatial period .",
    "rigid strings may have a remanent curvature .",
    "finally , a ( tiny ) gravity effect can be avoided by using well stretched vertical lines .    in our experiments",
    "three different strings were tested : a sewing string , a smooth tennis racket string , and an opaque fishing string , all shown in fig .  [ fig : three_types_lines1 ] .",
    "sewing strings have a braid pattern and their thickness oscillates .",
    "tennis racket strings are rigid and require a very strong tension to become straight .",
    "fishing strings are both smooth and flexible , and can therefore be easily tightened and become very straight . the transparent ones , however , behave like a cylindrical lens , producing multiple complex edges . opaque fishing strings",
    "end up being the best choice to build a calibration harp .",
    "[ fig : string_high_freq1 ] shows an evaluation of the obtained straightness .",
    "we took photos of the three types of strings , and corrected their distortion .",
    "the green curves show the signed distance from edge points of a corrected line to its regression line .",
    "the red curve shows the high frequency component of the corresponding distorted line .",
    "the high frequency is computed as follows :    * transform the edge points extracted from the distorted line into the intrinsic coordinate system , which is determined by the direction of the regression line computed from these points . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the @xmath27-coordinate is the distance between the edge points and a reference edge point along the regression line and the @xmath28-coordinate is the signed distance from the edge points to the regression line .",
    "this produces a one - dimensional signal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : intrinsic_coord ] ) . *",
    "apply a big gaussian convolution of standard deviation @xmath29 pixels on this one - dimensional signal to keep only the low frequency component .",
    "* the difference between this convolved signal and the original signal in the intrinsic coordinate system is considered as the high frequency .",
    "the red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : string_high_freq1 ] show the high frequency ( due to the border effect of gaussian convolution , there is a sharp increase of magnitude at the border ) .",
    "direction is determined by the direction of the regression line .",
    "the @xmath27-coordinate is the distance to the reference point along the regression line and the @xmath28-coordinate is the signed distance from the edge points to the regression line.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    to ensure the precision of the edge detection in the string images , a uniform background whose color contrasts well with the string color must be preferred .",
    "using an opaque background is not a good idea because this requires a direct lighting and the strings project shadows on the background ( fig .",
    "[ fig : harp_opaque_bg1 ] and [ fig : closeup_harp_opaque_bg1 ] ) .",
    "the sky itself is hardly usable : a large open space is needed to avoid buildings and trees entering the camera field of view , and clouds render it inhomogeneous , see fig .",
    "[ fig : background1 ] .",
    "the simplest solution is to place a translucent homogeneous paper or plastic sheet behind the harp and to use back illumination , preferably natural light to make it more uniform ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : harp_translucent_bg1 ] and [ fig : closeup_harp_translucent_bg1 ] ) .",
    "the acquisition aspects are also important for producing high quality measurements : lens blur , motion blur , aliasing , noise , must be as reduced as physically possible . to that aim a tripod and timer",
    "were used to reduce camera motions , but also to avoid out of focus strings while taking photos at different orientations .",
    "of course , changing focus changes the distortion .",
    "thus each distortion calibration must be done for a fixed focus , and is associated with this focus .",
    "in this section we describe the procedure to extract accurately and smooth the aligned edge points , which will be used to measure the distortion .    devernay s algorithm @xcite is the classic sub - pixel accurate edge detector .",
    "the implementation of devernay s detector is very simple since it is derived from the well - known non - maxima suppression method @xcite . on good quality images ( snr larger than 100 ) , devernay s detector can attain a precision of about @xmath30 pixels .",
    "straightness measurements require the detection of groups of edge points that belong to the same physical straight line , and the rejection of points that do not belong to any line . to this aim ,",
    "line segments are detected on the image using the lsd algorithm @xcite . when applied to photographs of the calibration harp",
    ", the detection essentially corresponds to the strings . in case of a strong distortion",
    ", one string edge could be cut into several line segments .",
    "lsd works by grouping connected pixels into _ line support regions _ , see fig .",
    "[ fig : line - support - regions ] ; for more details we refer to @xcite .",
    "these regions are then approximated by a rectangle and validated .",
    "the _ line support region _ links a line segment to its support pixels .",
    "thus , devernay s edge points that belong to the same _ line support region _ can be grouped as aligned ; points belonging to none are ignored .    for photos of strings ,",
    "almost every pixel along each side of one string is detected as an edge point at sub - pixel precision .",
    "so there are about @xmath31 edge points detected for a line of length of about @xmath31 pixels .",
    "this large number of edge points opens the possibility to further reduce the detection and aliasing noise left by sub - sampling the edge points .",
    "the sub - sampling step must be done carefully .",
    "first the edge points are re - sampled to warrant a uniform sampling step along the edge ; this will facilitate the following steps .",
    "the re - sampling uses a step of @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the length of a line and @xmath34 is the number of extracted edge points on the line .",
    "the interpolation of an edge point @xmath35 between two adjacent edge points @xmath36 and @xmath37 is expressed by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the distances between the points , see fig .",
    "[ fig : resampling ] .",
    "then , a gaussian blur with @xmath41 is needed before a sub - sampling of factor @xmath42 to avoid aliasing @xcite .",
    "we have two one - dimensional signals ( @xmath27-coordinate and @xmath28-coordinate of edge points ) along the length of the line .",
    "the gaussian convolution is performed on both one - dimension signals , parameterized by the length along the edge .",
    "finally , the sub - sampling of integer factor @xmath42 keeps one edge point out of @xmath42 .",
    ", @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the edge points extracted by devernay s detector .",
    "they are irregularly sampled along the line . the re - sampling ( in white dots )",
    "is made along the line with the uniform length step @xmath45 .",
    "linear interpolation is used to compute the re - sampled points.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "this section examines two natural distortion measurements that are somewhat complementary .      according to theorem  [ theo : fundamental_prop ] , the most direct measure should be the straightness error , defined as the root - mean - square ( rms ) distance from a set of distorted edge points that correspond to the same physical line , to their global linear regression line , see fig .",
    "[ fig : straightness ] .",
    "given @xmath34 edge points @xmath46 of a distorted line , the regression line @xmath47 is computed by @xmath48 where @xmath49 since @xmath50 is a unit vector , the signed distance from point @xmath51 to the line is given by @xmath52 given @xmath33 lines , with @xmath53 points in line @xmath54 , the total sum of squared signed distance is given by @xmath55 thus , the rms straightness error is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total number of points .",
    "an alternative measure is the average maximal error defined by @xmath58 in the classic camera maker practice , the maximal error is defined by @xmath59 which would become instable with the calibration harp , some of the strings being potentially distorted by blur or wrong detection .",
    "this measure is traditionally used in manual settings , for example see fig .",
    "[ fig : dxo_distortion ] . while traditionally the measures are made",
    "relatively to the line joining the extremities of the distorted edge , see fig .",
    "[ fig : arc ] , here we use the signed distance to the regression line to make it more comparable to the previous measure .",
    "the use of a signed distance and the difference between the maximal and minimal value is needed to handle correctly the fact that there are values on both sides of the regression line , see fig .  [",
    "fig : arc ] .",
    "in this section , real photographs of the calibration harp will be used to evaluate the residual camera distortion when this distortion has been corrected with three state - of - the - art correction methods or two popular software .",
    "in addition , we can feed any plumb - line method with the precise edge points detected on the harp images to improve the correction precision .",
    "the efficient alvarez et  al .",
    "algorithm thus becomes an automatic parametric distortion correction method .",
    "our lens distortion measurement algorithm can be tested on the online demo version available at http://bit.ly/lens-distortion .",
    "it is reported in @xcite that devernay edge points have a precision better than @xmath30 pixel under zero - noise condition . as proposed in section  [ sec : edge_detection ] , the precision of devernay edge points can be further improved by applying gaussian convolution of standard deviation @xmath60 , followed by a sub - sampling of factor @xmath42 . the only parameter to adjust here is the factor @xmath42 , which corresponds to the assumed regularity of the lens distortion .",
    "we are only interested in realistic lens distortion , which makes a straight line globally convex or concave .",
    "thus local edge oscillations due to noise can be harmlessly removed . in the experiments ,",
    "the value of @xmath61 was chosen , which is enough to remove the local oscillation while keeping the global distortion .      as a first main application",
