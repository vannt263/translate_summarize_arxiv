    "a variety of the @xmath1 cluster structure are known to exist in light stable nuclei .",
    "the most famous example is the hoyle state ( the @xmath3 state of @xmath4 ) whose dilute gas - like 3@xmath1 cluster structure has been studied in detail @xcite and identified well today .",
    "the linear - chain configuration of 3@xmath1 clusters in which @xmath1 particles are linearly aligned is an other example of famous and exotic cluster structure .",
    "it was firstly suggested by morinaga @xcite to explain the structure of the hoyle state .",
    "however , as mentioned above , it turned out that the hoyle state does not have the linear - chain configuration but has the dilute gas - like nature .",
    "in addition to this , the instability of the linear - chain configuration against the bending motion ( deviation from the linear alignment ) was pointed out by the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite and fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) calculations @xcite .",
    "thus , the formation of perfectly linear - aligned configuration in @xmath5 looks negative despite of the many years of research .",
    "the interest in the linear - chain configuration is reinforced by the unstable nuclear physics , because the valence neutrons may stabilize it by their glue - like role . such glue - like role of valence neutron is well known for be isotopes in which 2@xmath1 cluster core is assisted by the valence neutrons occupying the molecular - orbits @xcite . as a natural consequence , we expect that the linear - chain configuration can be realized in neutron - rich c isotopes , and this expectation have been motivating many theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "recently , rather promising candidates of linear - chain configuration in @xmath6 were independently reported by two groups @xcite .",
    "both groups observed the @xmath7 resonances above the @xmath1 threshold energy in both of positive- and negative - parity .",
    "the reported energies of the positive - parity resonances measured from the @xmath1 threshold are in reasonable agreement with the excitation energies of the linear - chain states predicted by suhara _",
    "@xcite on the basis of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculation .",
    "thus , rather promising evidence of the linear - chain formation has been found .    however , there are still several gaps between theory and experiment which must be resolved to confirm the linear - chain formation in @xmath6 .",
    "first , when measured from the ground state energy , theoretically predicted and experimentally observed excitation energies of the positive - parity resonances disagree .",
    "this may be because the effective interaction used in the calculation @xcite do not reproduce the @xmath1 threshold energy .",
    "second , the experiments report the negative - parity resonances , while the negative - parity linear - chain states were not clearly identified in ref .",
    "finally , the experiment @xcite reported the @xmath1 decay width of the resonances which is a strong evidence of the @xmath1 clustering and must be verified by the theoretical calculation .",
    "thus , further theoretical studies are in need to identify the linear - chain states in @xmath6 .    for this purpose , we investigated the linear - chain states in @xmath6 . for the sake of the quantitative comparison of the excitation energy , we performed amd calculation employing gogny d1s effective interaction @xcite which reproduces threshold energies in @xmath6 . from the amd wave function , we estimated the @xmath1 decay widths of the linear - chain states as well as those of other cluster and non - cluster states .",
    "it is found that the calculated excitation energies of the positive - parity linear - chain states are in good agreement with the observation , and only the linear - chain states have large @xmath1 decay widths comparable with the observed data .",
    "hence , we consider that the linear - chain formation in the positive - parity state is rather plausible . on the other hand , in the negative - parity state , the linear - chain configuration is fragmented into many states and do not form a single rotational band . as a further evidence of the linear - chain formation , we focus on the @xmath1 decay pattern .",
    "it is shown that the linear - chain states decay to the excited states of @xmath8be as well as the @xmath9 ground state , while other cluster states dominantly decay to the @xmath9 ground state .",
    "this characteristic decay pattern is , if it is observed , a strong signature of the linear - chain formation .",

    "we see that the energy of the ideal linear - chain is too high to be assigned to the observed resonances .",

    "the dominance of the @xmath91-bond configuration in the @xmath9 was confirmed by the observations @xcite .",
    "there are two prominent features to be noted in these results .",
    "the first is the magnitude of the reduced widths .",
    "the @xmath91-bond linear - chain band ( the @xmath109 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 states ) have large reduced widths compared to the triangular bands and the ground state .",
    "it is also noted that the @xmath1 reduced widths of other excited states are also smaller than the @xmath91-bond linear - chain band , and even smaller than or comparable with the triangular bands .",
    "hence , in the calculated energy region , the @xmath91-bond linear chain band has the largest reduced width . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rwa+](b)-(d ) , the observed reduced widths of the linear - chain candidates @xcite are also shown for @xmath107 , @xmath117 and @xmath125 states .",
    "since the decay to the @xmath126 ground state was _ assumed _ in the r - matrix analysis made in ref .",
    "@xcite , those values may be compared with the calculated results for the @xmath127 $ ] channel , and we see that only the @xmath91-bond linear - chain band can explain the magnitude of the observed reduced widths . thus , both of the observed excitation energies and reduced widths are reasonably explained by the @xmath91-bond linear - chain band , and we consider that the linear - chain formation in the positive - parity looks plausible .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the other linear - chain band , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath92-bond linear - chain band , has suppressed reduced widths despite of their prominent @xmath1 clustering .",
    "the reason is simple . because the @xmath92-bond linear - chain band does not have valence neutron in @xmath91-orbit",
    ", it is orthogonal to the decay channels to the @xmath9 ground state that has @xmath91-orbit neutron .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rwa+ ] ( e ) where the reduced widths for the decays to the @xmath9 with @xmath92-bond ( the excited rotational band of @xmath9 ) are shown .",
    "since other bands do not have valence neutrons in @xmath92-orbit , their reduced widths are suppressed , and only the @xmath92-bond linear - chain band has large widths .    another point to be noted is the decay pattern of the @xmath91-bond linear - chain band .",
    "the reduced widths in the [ @xmath8be@xmath128 channels are as large as or even larger than those in the [ @xmath8be@xmath129 channel .",
    "this dominance of the @xmath130 component in the @xmath91-bond linear - chain band is owe to its unique structure .",
    "when three @xmath1 particles are linearly aligned , because of the strong angular correlation between @xmath1 particles , the @xmath130 and @xmath131 components become large .",
    "this property is in contrast to the hoyle state where @xmath1 particles are mutually orbiting with @xmath132 , and hence , the @xmath133 component dominates @xcite .",
    "similar property of the linear - chain configuration were also discussed in @xmath4@xcite .",
    "therefore , if the large contamination of the @xmath130 component is confirmed , it will be a strong evidence for the linear - chain formation .",
    "quantum number and the angular momentum of @xmath9 . ]    the @xmath130 component in the triangular bands also show an interesting feature .",
    "there are two triangular bands with @xmath106 and @xmath134 .",
    "the @xmath3 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 states are the member of the @xmath106 band , while the @xmath105 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are member of the @xmath134 band . here",
    ", we clearly see that the @xmath139 component is dominant in the @xmath106 band , while the @xmath130 component is dominant in the @xmath134 band .",
    "this feature is explained by fig .",
    "[ fig : tri_illust ] . in the triangular bands , @xmath140he and @xmath8be are placed in a triangular shape and the intrinsic @xmath141-axis is chosen to be perpendicular to the deformation axis of @xmath9 . since the @xmath108 quantum number is the angular momentum directed to the intrinsic @xmath141-axis , @xmath108 must be equal to the angular momentum of @xmath9 .",
    "this makes the difference in the amount of the @xmath130 component in the @xmath106 and @xmath107 bands .",
    "for the negative parity , we show the states which have the reduced widths larger than 0.1 mev@xmath142 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rwa+ ] ( f)-(h ) .",
    "we can see that there are many states which have non - negligible @xmath1 reduced widths , and not able to identify the linear - chain band . as already mentioned , the linear - chain configurations are coupled with the non - cluster configurations and fragmented into many states as found in ref .",
    "we also see that none of the calculated state can explain the observed reduced widths that are twice larger than the present results .",
    "this requires further theoretical study of the negative - parity states , although the current result looks negative to the linear - chain formation in the negative - parity .",
    "in order to investigate the existence of the linear - chain state , we have studied the excited states of @xmath0c based on the amd calculations .    in the positive - parity states",
    ", we found that three different configurations appear depending on the magnitude of the deformation and the valence neutron configurations . at oblate deformed region , the triangular configuration of 3@xmath1 cluster was obtained , while at strong deformed prolate region , two different linear - chain configurations with valence neutrons in @xmath91-orbit and @xmath92-orbit were obtained .",
    "these cluster configurations generate clear rotational bands .",
    "the @xmath91-bond linear chain generates a rotational band around the @xmath1 threshold energy , while triangular and @xmath92-bond linear chain generate rotational bands well below and well above the threshold .",
    "the energy of the @xmath91-bond linear chain is in reasonable agreement with the resonances observed by the @xmath7 , while the triangular band is close to the excited states observed by the @xmath114be(@xmath115li , d)@xmath0c reaction .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath1 reduced width confirms the assignment of the @xmath91-bond linear chain to the observed resonances , because the calculated and measured widths showed reasonable agreement .",
    "thus , the positive - parity linear - chain formation in @xmath6 looks plausible .",
    "furthermore , the calculation predicts that the @xmath91-bond linear - chain will also decay to the @xmath130 as well as to the @xmath139 .",
    "this characteristic decay pattern will be , if measured , another evidence of the linear - chain formation .    in the negative - parity states , the negative - parity partners of the cluster states were also obtained by the energy variation .",
    "however , because of the mixing with the non - cluster configurations , these cluster configurations are fragmented into many excited states . as a result , many excited states that have sizable @xmath1 reduced width are obtained , and it makes the correspondence between the theory and experiment ambiguous .",

    "<S> the linear - chain states of @xmath0c are theoretically investigated by using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics . the calculated excitation energies and the @xmath1 decay widths of the linear - chain states </S>",

    "<S> the properties of the positive - parity linear - chain states reasonably agree with the observation , that convinces us of the linear - chain formation in the positive - parity states . on the other hand , in the negative - parity states </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the linear - chain configuration is fragmented into many states and do not form a single rotational band . as a further evidence of the linear - chain formation , we focus on the @xmath1 decay pattern . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the linear - chain states decay to the excited states of daughter nucleus @xmath2 as well as to the ground state , while other cluster states dominantly decay into the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we regard that this characteristic decay pattern is a strong signature of the linear - chain formation . </S>"
