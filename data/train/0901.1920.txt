    "in the independent particle model ( ipm ) of atomic nuclei , protons and neutrons move freely in a common mean - field potential .",
    "obviously , this is an approximate picture since the residual interaction smears the fermi surface and leads to partial occupation of each orbit . for states close to the fermi level ,",
    "this effect is observed through a reduction of the experimental knockout and pickup cross sections . experimental spectroscopic factors ( sfs )",
    "are defined as the quenching of the observed reaction rate with respect to that calculated assuming full occupancy .",
    "hence , they are interpreted as the occupation of a given orbit . however , from a strict theoretical point of view sfs are not occupation numbers .",
    "instead , they give a `` measure '' of what fraction of the _ final _ wave function can be factorized into a ( correlated ) core plus an independent particle or hole state .",
    "strong deviations from unity signal the onset of substantial correlation effects and imply the existence of non trivial many - body dynamics .    as far as stable nuclei are concerned",
    ", a large body of data has been accumulated from ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) experiments yielding the best estimates of absolute spectroscopic factors .",
    "these studies showed that proton sfs for isotopes all across the nuclear chart are uniformly quenched to 60 - 70% of the ipm value  @xcite .",
    "this information is however limited to protons and stable isotopes .",
    "more recently , experimental information on sfs of dripline isotopes has been obtained by means of nucleon knockout using intermediate energy heavy - ion beams  @xcite .",
    "these results also include neutron data , and suggest a strong dependence of sfs on the n / z ratio .    in nuclear structure studies , one usually distinguishes between short - range ( src ) and long - range and correlations ( lrc ) .",
    "the former are induced by the strong repulsive core and the tensor component of the nuclear force at small distances .",
    "these remove strength from the fermi sea to very high energies and momenta and have long been proposed as one possible mechanism for the quenching of sfs .",
    "however , different theoretical evaluations predicted that src can account for at most a 10 - 15% reduction ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath5o ) .",

    "the ( dressed ) solution @xmath19 is then taken as a new input and the whole calculation is iterated until convergence is reached .      the polarization propagator @xmath21 can be expanded in terms of simpler green s functions that involve the propagation of one quasiparticle [ eq .",

    "this expansion also serves as a guideline for systematic improvements of the method .    in the following we are interested in describing the coupling of sp motion to particle - hole ( ph ) and particle - particle ( hole - hole ) [ pp(hh ) ] collective excitations of the system . following refs .",

    "[ fig : p+sd_hsf ] , height=278 ]    failures to fully reproduce the observed removal strength can be traced to the difficulties of the rpa to describe the low - energy spectrum . to clarify this point we repeated the above calculations of the sp propagator by shifting , at each iteration , the first rpa @xmath37 eigenstate in @xmath2 .",

    "this change leads to the appearance of satellite @xmath30 fragments around -26.3  mev , which might be identified with the fragments seen experimentally at slightly higher energy .",
