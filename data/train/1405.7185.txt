    "free energy is a significant physical property for estimating thermodynamic stability .",
    "it is desirable to estimate free energy as accurately as possible .",
    "such free energy estimation is becoming important in a variety of research fields ; in particular , biological molecules including proteins or interfaces of nano - scale materials have been raised as a target for free energy calculations .",
    "it is thus desirable to develop methods that improve the accuracy and efficiency in free energy calculations using molecular simulation .",
    "the free energy in molecular systems has often been evaluated for a given constraint ( reaction pass).@xcite such a constraint is usually specified by using a set of reaction coordinates,@xcite for example , distances between molecules , bond angles , and dihedral angles , etc .    in order to get free energy landscapes , various techniques [ thermodynamic integration ( ti)@xcite , free energy perturbation,@xcite umbrella sampling,@xcite and so on ] have been developed so far .",
    "although ti is derived from the statistical mechanics faithfully , some difficulties have been pointed out ; poor sampling which could come from a breakdown of the ergodicity and numerical integration as postprocessing .    to overcome",
    "these difficulties , free energy calculation methods based on mean force dynamics ( mfd ) have been proposed.@xcite in mfd , a set of @xmath0 reaction coordinates ( collective variables ) , @xmath1 , is regarded as a set of fictitious dynamical variables , and their trajectories are designed to be generated by hypothetical dynamical equations .",
    "et al._@xcite have recently introduced a logarithmic form of the free energy along @xmath2 [ @xmath3 to enable us to easily sample rare events in mfd calculations .",
    "this method is called logarithmic mean force dynamics ( logmfd ) , in which the free energy can be estimated on - the - fly .",
    "the evaluation of mean force ( mf ) , i.e. , slope of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath2 , in such a method based on mfd can be improved by incorporating first - principles ( fp ) molecular dynamics ( md),@xcite replacing the classical md using empirical force fields .",
    "fpmd allows us to include effects of the electronic state explicitly ; for example , bond - formation or bond - breaking , which may considerably influence the free energy profiles in molecular systems .    in this paper , we have developed first - principles mfd in the framework of logmfd , namely , first - principles logmfd ( fp - logmfd ) .",
    "we reconstruct the free energy landscape for a molecular system of glycine dipeptide using fp - logmfd .",
    "this demonstration indicates that fpmd can be incorporated into logmfd of multi - dimensional @xmath2-systems and that the scheme developed here is found to be promising for the free energy reconstruction using _ ab initio _ techniques .",
    "the successful combination of logmfd and fpmd is indebted to the efficiency for sampling rare events in logmfd .",
    "the logarithmic form introduced in logmfd suppresses the effective energy barriers for the dynamical variables @xmath2 .",
    "this makes it possible to sample configurations with higher energy , as frequently as those with much lower energy .",
    "this feature also makes it possible to improve the accuracy of the mf by increasing the number of statistical samples ( fpmd steps ) .    in the next section",
    ", we review the logmfd method briefly and demonstrate how to incorporate fpmd into logmfd . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the free energy profile with respect to the dihedral angles in glycine dipeptide molecule . in sec .",
    "iv , we will discuss the entropic contribution and numerical accuracy in the present results by comparing it with the result previously obtained using an empirical force field .",

    "v summarizes this paper .",
    "we present a brief review for logmfd . this review would be a good introduction to our new scheme which employs a non - empirical approach .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath5 atoms with a given temperature @xmath6 , and aim to reconstruct the free energy profile @xmath4 with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "each reaction coordinate @xmath7 is generally a function of the atomic coordinates @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 specify the @xmath9th reaction coordinate and the @xmath10th atom , respectively . in mfd , however , @xmath2 are regarded as dynamical variables , being independent of @xmath8 .",
    "we now consider the following postulated hamiltonian for @xmath2 ;    @xmath11    where the first and second terms on the right - hand - side are the kinetic and potential energies , respectively , for @xmath12 ( @xmath13 means the velocity @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 is the fictitious mass for @xmath12 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath16 is thus obtained as ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the mf .",
    "the solution for this equation of motion fulfills the conservation law , i.e. , @xmath19 can be seen as a constant of motion , as long as the mf is accurately evaluated .",
    "several methods based on mfd have been proposed thus far , which provide us free energy profiles with respect to reaction coordinates and allow us to discuss many kinds of physics involving the reaction coordinates .",
    "metadynamics@xcite has been introduced utilizing the concept of mfd , and has been applied to a variety of systems including biosystems to sample rare events and to reconstruct free energy profiles .",
    "et al._@xcite have proposed logmfd in which @xmath4 in eq .",

    "the heights of the energy barriers on @xmath32 are much lower than those on @xmath4 .",
    "this reduction of the barrier height enables the coordinate @xmath12 to easily cross the barriers at a moderate temperature of @xmath31 , allowing us to evaluate the free energy associated with rare events .",
    "@xmath33 is obtained as an ensemble average and , practically , can be estimated as a time - averaged quantity from a thermostatted md or monte carlo ( mc ) simulation at a given temperature @xmath6 with a given potential @xmath34 for the @xmath5-atom system and a set of fixed reaction coordinates @xmath2 ; @xmath35_{\\bf x }   e^{-\\phi({\\bf r})/k_{\\rm b}t_{\\rm ext } } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\simeq &   \\frac{1}{\\tau } \\int^{\\tau}_{0 } dt         \\left [               \\frac{\\partial \\phi({\\bf r}(t ) ) } { \\partial x_{p } }         \\right]_{\\bf x } , \\label{canonical}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the simulation time period , and the @xmath38_{\\bf x}$ ] represents the ensemble average under the set of constraints . in the mf estimation , it is expected that the canonical md or mc simulation provides the canonical distribution under the constraint on @xmath2 .",
    "the mf is , in our approach , evaluated using thermostatted fpmd .",

    "it has been confirmed that the substantial reduction of the free energy barriers , thanks to the logarithmic form , enables us to efficiently reconstruct the free energy profile , which was found to agree well with that obtained by the ti method .",
    "the free energy profile from the first - principles approach indicates that the empirical force field for the glycine dipeptide molecule is sufficient to obtain the overall profile of the free energy landscape .",
    "the logmfd method allows us not only to easily sample rare events , but also to reconstruct the free energy profile  _ on - the - fly _ \" without suffering from the problems such as how to arrange the grid points or how to perform the numerical integration ( as postprocessing ) in ti .",
    "it has been demonstrated in the present study that free energy profiles using _ ab initio _ force field can be reconstructed with less computational cost than is needed in the ti method .",
    "the fp - logmfd method developed here is thus a promising tool for reconstructing free energy profiles , especially those in which accurate descriptions for interatomic interactions are required .",
