    "the collisional model that we consider consists of a system ( @xmath1 ) interacting with an ensemble of environmental particles , @xmath2 , one at a time .",
    "each @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is a _ subenvironment _ , and @xmath5 is the number of elements constituting the environment . throughout this work",
    "we will take each @xmath3 to be a two - level system . in our model , a given subenvironment interacts with the system only once and is then discarded .      in the case of",
    "identical non - interacting subenvironments , one gets a dynamical process called quantum homogenization @xcite .",
    "as the system qubit collides with the environmental ones , its state will gradually change , and after a sufficient number of collisions it will eventually become identical to the initial state of the subenvironments .",
    "clearly , this is a microscopic model of markovian decoherence .",
    "however , adding @xmath14-@xmath14 collisions to the model , the reduced dynamical evolution of @xmath1 becomes non - markovian : some of the information that the system has lost to a subenvironment propagates within the environment due to @xmath14-@xmath14 interactions , and is fed back to the system at a later collision .",
    "the form of @xmath12 strongly affects the degree of non - markovianity of the dynamics .",
    "for example , a swap - like interaction between neighbouring subenvironments results in a non - markovian time evolution whose degree is determined by whether a partial or full swap operation is used @xcite .",
    "nearest - neighbour , while the right column depicts the collective interaction scenario with qubits upto @xmath21 nearest - neighbour .",
    "generalization to longer - range interactions follows from the picture presented here .",
    "[ fig : model ] ]    in this work , our aim is to construct a simple collisional model which allows for demonstration and control of non - markovian features .",
    "we model the @xmath1-@xmath14 and @xmath14-@xmath14 couplings as spin - spin interactions , which may be implemented in systems like quantum dot spin - valve type devices ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) or molecular nano - magnets . in order to model the @xmath1-@xmath14 interaction ,",
    "we choose the hamiltonian governing the dynamics as ( we take units such that @xmath22 throughout the manuscript ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the pauli matrices . for the case of @xmath14-@xmath14 coupling , we want to extend the length of the interaction beyond nearest - neighbour ( @xmath25 ) and see if and how the amount of non - markovianty depends on such a modification .",
    "we introduce the long - range interactions in two ways , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] . on one hand",
    ", we consider separate interactions with @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 @xmath25 subenvironments , for which the @xmath14-@xmath14 hamiltonians can be written as the heisenberg - like couplings @xmath29 with @xmath30 . on the other hand",
    ", we introduce subenvironment interactions as an equally weighted linear combination of the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , such as @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this scenario can be seen as the collective interaction of the environmental qubit which has interacted with the system , with the remaining environmental qubits .",
    "interactions between subenvironments are designed to be only in the forward direction , i.e. @xmath36 interacts with @xmath37 particle(s ) only if @xmath38 as the environmental particles with @xmath39 have already been discarded .    in order to quantify and discuss the non - markovian behaviour in our models",
    ", it is now appropriate to introduce the measure of non - markovianity which will be utilized in this manuscript .",
    "it is known as the blp measure @xcite and based on the trace distance between two quantum states @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the trace norm .",
    "the trace distance is zero for indistinguishable ( identical ) quantum states , while it is unity for completely distinguishable ( orthogonal ) quantum states , thus it can be thought as measure of distinguishability .",
    "consider two completely distinguishable initial states which are then exposed to same markovian environment .",
    "both of the initial states will eventually lose all their initial information into the environmental degrees of freedom , and become identical . due to the markovian nature of the dynamical process",
    ", the loss of their distinguishability , as quantified by the trace distance , will be monotonic in time .",
    "in other words , the rate of change of the trace distance will always be negative , @xmath42 .",
    "however , if there is a deviation from this behavior , such that @xmath43 , we can conclude that the dynamical evolution under consideration is non - markovian in nature .",
    "intuitively , we can interpret the increase in the trace distance as a backflow of the information that the subject system has lost into the environment .",
    "based on this , it is possible to define a measure of non - markovianity as follows @xcite @xmath44 where the maximization is made over all possible pairs of initial states @xmath45 and @xmath46 . since in the collision model considered in this work",
    "the time evolution takes place in discrete steps , we will use the discretized version of the above measure , expressed as @xcite @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the index that denotes the collision number .",
    "it is important to note that , while observing a temporary increase in the trace distance is sufficient to conclude that the dynamical map is non - markovian , the converse statement is not always true : there may be a non - markovian time evolution in which the trace distance decreases monotonically . in this sense ,",
    "the condition @xmath43 is only a witness for non - markovianity .",
    "we start by presenting our findings on separate @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath25 subenvironment interactions and compare them to the case of @xmath25 coupling . to begin with , assume weak system - environment coupling ( @xmath49 ) and set the interaction strength @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the interaction time .",
    "considering the interactions between the subenvironments , it is known that for the @xmath25 interaction the maximum degree of non - markovianity is obtained when @xmath52 , which upto a global phase , corresponds to the full swap operation between the neighbour environmental systems   @xcite .",
    "this is a rather expected result , as by completely swapping the two subenvironments one actually makes the system interact with the same environmental state at every @xmath1-@xmath14 collision .",
    "decreasing the value of @xmath53 below @xmath54 will result in the gradual degradation and eventual loss of the non - markovian features of the model .",
    "the same line of thought also applies in the case of distant @xmath14-@xmath14 couplings : to obtain the highest degree of non - markovianity we again set @xmath52 .",
    "the initial system states that maximize the blp measure are @xmath55 and the initial state of each subenvironment is set to be @xmath56 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : separate ] that , as the distance between the two interacting subenvironments increases up to the @xmath28 @xmath25 , the degree of non - markovianity monotonically increases too .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the number of collisions needed for the saturation of @xmath57 is affected by the choice of the environmental interaction : the system qubit needs to go through a higher number of collisions as compared to the @xmath25 @xmath14-@xmath14 interaction case , before settling to a final state which is the same as the environment initial state .",
    "it is also important to note that , as the distance between two interacting subenvironments increases , we observe a shift towards higher values in the number of collisions needed , to have a non - zero degree of non - markovianity .",
    "the reason behind this is that in the cases of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath25 interactions , the system qubit has to interact respectively with one , two and three subenvironments , which are all in their initial state , before it comes in contact with the subenvironment that has a partial information about its past state .    as an extension to the single separate interaction , it is possible to consider two or more consecutive separate interactions of the environmental qubits with different or same coupling strengths .",
    "however , these scenarios do not increase the non - markovianity due to the swap - like form of the interaction that we choose in our model .",
    "for example , considering a @xmath25 interaction followed by a @xmath26 @xmath25 interaction with @xmath52 will result in the same value of @xmath57 as the sole @xmath25 interaction : when the interaction with the @xmath26 @xmath25 takes place , the environmental qubit that has interacted with the system has already been swapped with the @xmath25 subenvironment , which is in its initial state .",
    "therefore the @xmath26 @xmath25 interaction does not produce any difference in the dynamics .",
    "one can naturally ask what happens if we relax the full swap condition and freely change the interaction strengths of various consecutive separate interactions . even though the answer is not quite definitive",
    ", one can still observe , following the example above , that the degree of non - markovianity changes from zero to the maximum obtained in the sole @xmath26 @xmath25 interaction .",
    "therefore , we can tune the amount of non - markovianity of the dynamical evolution in our model .",
    "this example can be generalized to any combination of consecutive interactions considered in this work , given that the interactions are ordered by the increasing distance between environmental qubits .    , @xmath26 @xmath25 , @xmath27 @xmath25 , @xmath28 @xmath25 interactions .",
    "the initial system states that maximize @xmath57 are @xmath58 and @xmath52 for all cases .",
    "[ fig : separate ] ]      we would like now to turn our focus on the collective long - range interaction model , and again see whether it is possible to enhance the degree of non - markovianity , as quantified by the trace distance .",
    "we again assume weak system - environment coupling @xmath50 . comparing with the previous case , we see that the value of @xmath52 which yields the strongest non - markovianity for the separate interaction scenario , is no longer the best choice if we change the environmental interaction hamiltonian to a collective one .",
    "in fact , we find that the maximum degree of non - markovianity is obtained for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "moreover , apart from these specific @xmath53 values , @xmath57 is always zero , which implies that either the time evolution is markovian , or that its non - markovian character can not be detected by the blp measure .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : collective ] , we present @xmath57 versus the number of @xmath1-@xmath14 collisions .",
    "it is clear that extending the @xmath14-@xmath14 interactions and considering collective interactions significantly increases the degree of non - markovianity as compared to just the @xmath25 coupling .",
    "however , this increase is not monotonic in the number of interacting environmental qubits : the time evolution governed by @xmath63 settles to a lower @xmath57 value than that given by @xmath62 , but still greater than that obtained by @xmath65 . including the @xmath28 @xmath25 interaction further decreases @xmath57 , which however remains significantly higher than in the case of just @xmath25 interaction .",
    "the mechanism behind this decrease may be the dilution of the system information that has leaked to the environment . at every @xmath14-@xmath14 interaction ,",
    "some information about the original state of the first environmental qubit is transferred to the forthcoming subenvironments , together with some information from the system .",
    "increasing the interaction length when such collective interactions are considered , results in increasing the number of times that an environmental qubit receives information from the system , before it interacts directly with the system qubit . as a result , in comparison with the separate interaction case ,",
    "in the collective interaction case it is possible to reach higher values of non - markovianity ( cf .",
    "the y - axis ranges in figs .",
    "[ fig : separate ] and [ fig : collective ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as the range of the @xmath14-@xmath14 interaction increases , the values at which @xmath57 is saturated get closer and closer .",
    "one way to understand this result is that , as the number of collectively interacting subenvironments increases , we gradually approach the spin - boson model limit in the @xmath14-@xmath14 interactions , therefore the final values of @xmath57 converge to the same number .",
    "interactions , @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath25 interactions , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath25 interactions , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath25 interactions , with the interaction strengths @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively . the initial states that maximize @xmath57 are @xmath58 for all cases . [",
    "fig : collective ] ]      another important fact observed when considering collective @xmath14-@xmath14 interactions is that the number of collisions needed to reach the maximum amount of non - markovianity increases almost by an order of magnitude , with respect to the @xmath25 interaction case .",
    "the `` time '' it takes to reach the final configuration is also considerably higher as compared to the separate interaction case ( cf . the x - axis ranges in figs .",
    "[ fig : separate ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : collective ] ) .",
    "-norm of coherence against the number of collisions , for @xmath25 ( at the top ) , separate ( left column ) and collective ( right column ) interactions . from top",
    "to bottom the range of the @xmath14-@xmath14 interactions increases .",
    "we can see that the the number of @xmath1-@xmath14 collisions required for the coherence to vanish increases with longest living coherence being the one having the highest degree of non - markovianity in both environment models .",
    "the frequency of oscillations in the collective interaction case is much higher than that of the separate interaction case .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] ]    the reason why the saturation of @xmath57 happens later in the long - range separate and collective interaction cases , compared to the case with just @xmath25 interaction , is that the revivals in the trace distance continue for a higher number of collisions , resulting in a more pronounced non - markovianity of the dynamics .",
    "since we interpret these revivals as the backflow of information from the environment to the system , we also looked for the effects of this information regain on the coherence contained in our system , which is initially in the fully coherent @xmath66 or @xmath67 state .",
    "indeed , we observe a connection between the degree of non - markovianity and the coherence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] : prolonged oscillations in the trace distance , and therefore increased @xmath57 , are accompanied by prolonged oscillations in the coherence possessed by the system .",
    "we quantify the coherence with a recently introduced coherence measure , the @xmath68-norm of coherence @xmath69 which is nothing but the sum of the absolute values of the off - diagonal elements in the density matrix @xcite .",
    "@xmath70 satisfies all the criteria introduced in @xcite to be a valid measure of quantum coherence .",
    "therefore , we have shown that the stronger the non - markovianity in our system , the longer the time for which the coherence content will remain finite . in other words , by increasing the range of the interaction between subenvironments , we increase the number of collisions required for the complete decoherence of the system qubit , which is quite desirable in most practical cases . comparing the separate interaction scenario with the collective one , we can conclude that in terms of coherence life - time the latter is much more advantageous than the former .",
    "such a correlation between the non - markovianity of a dynamical evolution and prolonged oscillations in the coherence have also been reported in a model constructed to understand the mechanism behind the long - lived coherence in photosynthetic complexes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite the interplay between coherence and non - markovianity was examined in a refined spin - boson model , and it was shown that non - markovianity causes revivals in the dynamics of coherence . a more detailed analysis in these lines of work can be found in @xcite .",
    "we also investigated whether the trend of the non - markovianity can be connected with the behaviour of the correlations created between the system and the subenvironment with whom it has just interacted . in order to quantify these correlations , we chose to look at the mutual information ( mi ) between @xmath1 and @xmath14 after they have interacted with each other : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "( at the top ) , separate ( left column ) and collective ( right column ) interactions . from top",
    "to bottom the range of the @xmath14-@xmath14 interactions increases .",
    "[ fig : mi ] ]    we present our findings on the relation between the mi and @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mi ] .",
    "first , one can immediately notice that the mi is significantly different from zero only around the first few hundred collisions , and approaches zero long before the non - markovianity measure saturates to its final value .",
    "furthermore , we can see that in the separate interaction case , as the interaction length is increased , the mi becomes more delocalized , and remains finite for a higher number of collisions .",
    "such a behaviour of the mi seems correlated with the degree of non - markovianity : the more the mi delocalizes ( spreads ) over the number of collisions , the higher is the increase between two plateaus of @xmath57 , which results directly in a higher degree of non - markovianity .",
    "as the mi tends to zero , the increase of the non - markovianity measure also slows down .",
    "another correlation between the behaviours of mi and @xmath57 is that the increases and plateaus of @xmath57 occur in coincidence with the odd and even revivals of the mi respectively .",
    "mutual information is not the only tool available to investigate the connection between quantum non - markovianity and system - environment correlations .",
    "@xcite provides a link between the behaviour of the trace distance derivative @xmath73 and system - environment correlations , which are quantified using the matrix @xmath74 as explained below ; such matrix is identically zero when system and environment are completely uncorrelated . in ref .",
    "@xcite the trace distance derivative is upper bounded by a quantity dependent explicitly on @xmath75 .",
    "the result is obtained in the weak coupling limit , under the assumptions of a system - environment interaction generated by the propagator @xmath76 for any initial time @xmath77 , and of an initially uncorrelated system - environment state : let @xmath78 be two arbitrary initial system states , and @xmath79 be identical initial environment states , than the joint initial states are @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",

    "note that with our choice of initial conditions , at the beginning both @xmath92 and @xmath93 are zero , and so @xmath94 .",
    "the application of this bound to our dynamical model requires some care : in our implementation , after each iteration ( @xmath1-@xmath14 followed by @xmath14-@xmath14 interaction ) , in order to prepare the states for the following step , system and environment are traced apart assigning to each of them the respective marginal state .",
    "this operation erases at every step all the @xmath1-@xmath14 correlations that may have been created , and causes the ( discretized ) term @xmath95 to be identically 0 at each step @xmath48 .",

    "moreover , it is possible to tune the degree of non - markovianity by considering a scenario in which we consecutively apply separate @xmath14-@xmath14 interactions of different length and tunable strength .",
    "however , for collectively interacting environments , the interaction strength must be set to a very specific value in order to observe a non - markovian dynamics . in both scenarios , the blp measure of non - markovianity saturates after a certain number of collisions between the system and the subenvironments .",

    "<S> we consider a model that describes the system - environment interaction through a series of sequential `` collisions '' between the system and the environmental particles . </S>",
    "<S> such `` collisional '' model is capable of simulating both markovian and non - markovian dynamics depending on the interaction and/or correlation between the environmental degrees of freedom @xcite . </S>",
