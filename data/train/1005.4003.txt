    "it is undeniable that ultra - peripheral collisions ( i.e. , collisions dominated by the electromagnetic interaction ) between relativistic heavy ions allows interesting physics to be probed . as far back as 1989 it was noticed that even the higgs boson could be produced at comparable rates as in central collisions between relativistic heavy ions @xcite , the advantage being that ultra - peripheral collisions are cleaner in the sense that nothing else than the higgs boson would be observed . by now ,",
    "ultra - peripheral collisions are known as and excellent tool for several interesting phenomena and have been discussed in numerous publications , reviews , and popular articles ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a process of interest in ultra - peripheral collisions with relativistic heavy ions is the production of pairs in which one of the particles is captured in an orbit around one of the ions in the collider (  bound - free \" pair production ) .",
    "in particular the process of pair - production with capture was used as a tool to generate the first artificial anti - hydrogen atom in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the pioneer cern experiment was followed by another experiment at fermilab @xcite . the number of anti - atoms produced was shown to be in good agreement with detailed theoretical predictions @xcite .    in this article",

    "the energy levels and transition rates from excited states to the ground state of muonic atoms also provide experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics .",

    "protonium has been studied theoretically mainly by using non - relativistic quantum mechanics , which yields predictions for its binding energy and lifetime .",
    "the lifetimes are predicted in the range of 0.1 - 10 microseconds .",
    "while protonium production has a very small cross section in pp collisions at cern , the cross section is appreciable for heavy ions , e.g. for pb - pb collisions . in this case , the anti - proton will be captured in an orbit around one of the pb nuclei .",
