    "the resonance does become narrower , so at finite temperatures thermal smearing will still lead to a suppression with increasing barrier height and this might not be the most effective strategy to distinguish the two effects . * the disappearance of the conductance peak when the magnetic field is rotated ( in the plane of the substrate ) towards a direction perpendicular to the wire , the technique used in refs .",
    ", can identify the majorana zero - mode  but only if the ratio @xmath129 is sufficiently large that the wire is in class d rather than bdi . in class bdi the zeeman energy in the rotated field commutes with the rashba energy , precluding the weak antilocalization effect as well as the majorana resonance . both refs .",

    "measuring the conductance through a single - mode point contact is a very effective strategy : for @xmath130 the zero - temperature conductance @xmath131 directly measures the topological quantum number even without any tunnel barrier @xcite , and this signature of a majorana zero - mode is quite robust against finite temperatures .",
    "( the chararacteristic energy scale is the induced superconducting gap in the region between the point contact and the superconductor . )",
    "the single mode in the point contact should be spin resolved for this to work : if instead the point contact transmits both spins in one orbital mode ( @xmath132 ) , then the ambiguity between weak antilocalization and the majorana resonance remains ( see fig .",
