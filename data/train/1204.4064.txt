    "in the fermi liquid theory ( flt ) @xcite a system of interacting bosons or fermions is described as a gas of quasiparticles .",
    "the population of the quasiparticle states has the expression of the ideal bose or fermi population ( depending on the type of particles that are in the system ) if the quasiparticle energy , @xmath0 , is defined as the variation of the total energy of the system with respect to the population of the quasiparticle state . if the system is not trivial , the sum of the energies of the quasiparticles is not equal to the total energy of the system and since the quasiparticle energies also depend on the occupation of the quasiparticle states , the thermodynamic properties of the quasiparticle gas may neither be similar to those of an ideal particle gas , nor to the thermodynamic properties of the original system .",
    "in such a case , the ideal gas characteristics of the interacting particle system , conjectured based on an idealized quasiparticle model ( e.g. the textbook result that @xmath1 in the low temperature limit @xcite ) is not rigorously justified .    in this paper",
    "i propose a method to describe the flt system as an ideal gas of fractional exclusion statistics ( fes ) particles @xcite .",
    "for this i redefine the quasiparticle energies such that the total energy of the system equals the energy of the quasiparticle gas , ensuring in this way that the thermodynamic properties of the system are identical to the thermodynamic properties of the quasiparticle gas .",
    "moreover , in this method the quasiparticle energies do not depend on the occupations of the quasiparticle states and therefore _ the gas is ideal _ , unlike landau s quasiparticle gas .    the fes has been applied before to flt type of systems , but with equally spaced free - particle energy levels , @xmath2 , and the particle - particle interaction described in the mean field approximation ",
    "i.e. @xmath3 @xcite . other types of closely related systems to",
    "which fes has been applied are the bose and fermi gases described in the thermodynamic bethe ansatz @xcite and spin chains @xcite    the systems of equal and constant dos ( i.e. equally spaced free - particle energy levels ) described in the mean - field approximation are all thermodynamically equivalent ( i.e. they all have the same heat capacity and entropy for any temperature and particle number ) , no matter if the particles are bosons , fermions , or obey fes of constant , diagonal fes parameters @xcite .",
    "therefore the fes is not a necessary tool for such systems .",
    "the fes has been applied to systems of any dos and general type of interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite and this provides the method for describing systems of interacting particles as ideal gases that i shall use in this paper .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ basics ]",

    "i show the limitations of the landau s quasiparticle model in the description of the interacting particle system . in section [ section_fes ]",

    "i discuss only fermions .",
    "then the grandcanonical partition function is @xmath10 \\nonumber \\\\     & & - \\beta[e(\\{n_{{\\bf i}}\\})-\\mu n ] \\label{cz_fermi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the ( average ) populations , denoted by @xmath11 , are obtained by imposing the maximization condition , @xmath12 .",
