    "the brans - dicke theory , the paradigma of scalar - tensor theories , is considered as an important alternative to the theory of general relativity ( gr ) [ brans&dicke , 1962 ] . in this theory",
    "the gravitational coupling @xmath0 is considered as a dynamical quantity represented by the field @xmath1 which is introduced in the gravitational action through a kinetic term and a non - minimal coupling with the usual ricci scalar .",
    "a new parameter @xmath2 quantifies the interaction of the scalar field and the gravitational term , such that as @xmath3 the general relativity theory is recovered .",
    "recent estimates using the planck data indicates a value @xmath4 [ avilez&skordis , 2013 ] . in spite of those observational constraints , small  or even negative  values of the parameter @xmath2",
    "may be very interesting .",
    "they arise , for example , in the string theories in their low - energy limit [ lidsey et al , 2000 ] .",
    "when negative values of @xmath2 are allowed , primordial singularity - free solutions emerge naturally from the brans - dicke theory [ gurevich et al , 1973 ] .",
    "late time accelerated solution can also be achieved , but at the price of a negative gravitational coupling [ batista et al , 2001 ] .",
    "some generalisations of gr evoke the gravitational anomaly effect , viz .",
    "rastall s theory .",
    "[ rastall , 1972 ; 1976 ] these generalisations touch one of the cornerstones of gravity theories : the conservation laws encoded in the null divergence of the energy - momentum tensor . since the concept of energy in gr is an object of discussion , the possibility that the energy - momentum tensor has a non - zero divergence should be considered in some situations .",
    "the idea of violation of the conventional conservation laws in the context of brans - dicke theory has been considered by smalley [ smalley , 1974 ] . in this approach ,",
    "the klein - gordon type equation for the scalar field was kept as in the brans - dicke theory while the einstein equations were changed accordingly . here",
    ", we would like to revisit this proposal following a different path : we try to write down the field equations in such a way that the brans - dicke , gr as well as the ordinary the rastall s theory are recovered : we keep the violation of the energy - momentum tensor in a spirit very close to the original formulation of the rastall s theory , and the klein - gordon type equation as well as the einstein s equations are modified accordingly .",
    "we investigate the resulting theory in two situations : spherically symmetrical and cosmological configuration . in the former case",
    ", we obtain that the only non - trivial solution is represented by the robinson - bertotti metric [ bertotti , 1959 ; robinson , 1959 ] ( its interpretation , however , differs from the conventional one ) . a solution that represents",
    "a star - like configuration is the `` trivial '' schwarzschild one . at cosmological level , we show that accelerated solutions are possible in the dust phase of the cosmic evolution without introducing dark energy .",
    "we display a particular case where a decelerated / accelerated transition in the recent universe is achieved with a positive effective gravitational coupling .",
    "the main idea of rastall s theory [ rastall , 1972 ] is the assumption that in curved space - time the usual conservation laws used in gr are violated .",
    "hence , there must be a connection between the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor and the curvature of the space - time . according to this program",
    ", the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor may be written as @xmath5 in equation ( [ r1a ] ) @xmath6 is a free parameter codifying the deviation from the conservation . when @xmath7 the traditional conservation laws are recovered .",
    "equation ( [ r1a ] ) is a phenomenological way to implement the gravitational anomaly due to quantum effects .    in the context of the brans - dicke theory ,",
    "we can make the identification @xmath8 .",
    "hence , @xmath9 let us generalize rastall s version of the field equations to the brans - dicke case .",
    "following the original rastall s formulation in the context of gr ,",
    "we write , @xmath10 combining the hypothesis ( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) , and using the bianchi s identities , we obtain that the scalar field @xmath1 must obey the equation : @xmath11 equations ( [ h1],[h2],[h3 ] ) form our complete system in this new formulation . when @xmath7 , the usual brans - dicke theory is recovered .",
    "the effective gravitational coupling today reads : @xmath12}{3\\lambda - 2(1 - 2\\lambda)\\omega}\\frac{1}{\\phi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath7 we obtain the corresponding expression for the brans - dicke theory .",
    "the classical tests of theory of gravity are based on the motion of test particles in the geometry of a spherically symmetric object like a star or a planet . hence , to verify the viability of the theory proposed , it is crucial to look for a spherically symmetric solution . as a first step , the ( exterior ) solution representing the space - time of a star - like object",
    "is considered .    in the vacuum case ,",
    "the equations reduce to @xmath13 the first of these equations leads to @xmath14 . hence ,",
    "in vacuum the ricci scalar is necessarily constant .",
    "the case @xmath15 corresponds to the schwarzschild solution of gr .",
    "let us consider a metric in the form : @xmath16 the functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend on the radial coordinate @xmath20 only .",
    "first we find that the constant @xmath21 is given by : @xmath22 now , the dalambertian reads : @xmath23\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 .",
    "let us choose the radial coordinate such that @xmath25 .",
    "writting the einsteinian equations as @xmath26 we obtain , in the extended form : @xmath27    equations ( [ v - e3],[curva ] ) lead to two supplementary equations : @xmath28    the only self - consistent solution for the above equations are : @xmath29 hence , the metric is @xmath30 if the scale  @xmath31 is chosen such that @xmath32 , making redefinitions @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , we arrive at : @xmath36 which is the so - called robinson - bertotti solution that is obtained , in the context of gr , by considering an electromagnetic field . hence , no black hole solution is possible .",
    "this solution appears as the only non - trivial ( non - schwarzschild solution ) vacuum solution .    a ppn analysis reveal that the classical tests of a gravitation theory are equally satisfied as in genera relativity if @xmath37 [ carams et al , 2014 ]",
    "this makes this theory quite competitive .",
    "let us consider an isotropic and homogeneous space - time described by the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , @xmath38 and an equation of state of the type @xmath39 , with @xmath40 constant .",

    "the power - law solutions constitute a very restrictive case , but they can indicate the kind of cosmological solution we can expect from the bdr theory . hence , suppose the solutions have the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constants .",
