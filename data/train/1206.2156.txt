    "<S> with the advent of high analysis technology in detecting the gamow - teller ( gt ) excited states beyond one nucleon emission threshold , the quenching of the gt strength to the ikeda sum rule seems to be recovered by the high - lying gt states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in some nuclei , the stronger gt peaks than any other peaks appear explicitly in the high - lying excited states . </S>",
    "<S> we address that these high - lying gt excited states stems from the smearing of the fermi surface by the increase of the chemical potential owing to the deformation within a framework of the deformed quasi - particle random phase approximation ( dqrpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> detailed mechanism leading to the smearing is discussed , and comparisons to the available experimental data are shown to explain the strong peaks on the high - lying gt excited states in a satisfactory manner .    </S>",
    "<S> the deformation in nuclei becomes more important than last decades with the recent development of rare isotope ( ri ) accelerator facilities , from which one may perform lots of challenging experiments related to the ri nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> most of them are thought to be deformed more or less . </S>",
    "<S> they are usually produced in the successive nuclear capture reactions in the cosmos , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ slow- and rapid- process , presumed to be occurred , respectively , at the initial and explosive stage of stellar evolution , such as supernovae ( sne ) explosion . </S>",
    "<S> although they decay fractions of a second , they imprint their existence on the nuclear abundances of stars @xcite .    another interesting nuclear process is the neutrino ( @xmath0)-process in the sne explosion which is treated as one of important nuclear processes for the nucleosynthesis , in particular , of the neutron - deficient nuclei , such as @xmath1la and @xmath2ta @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2ta is a well known deformed nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> since the neutrinos emitted from a proto - neutron star may have tens of mev energy high enough to excite the deformed nuclei , one needs to understand more precisely the high - lying excited states beyond one nucleon threshold . among them , </S>",
    "<S> the gt excitations are of great importance because most of the charge exchange reactions are dominated by the gt transition . </S>",
    "<S> these high - lying gt excited states are also closely related to the nuclear structure . for example </S>",
    "<S> , the gt quenching problem says that the difference of total running sums @xmath3 for empirical gt ( @xmath4 ) transitions , @xmath5 , is usually quenched compared to the ikeda sum rule ( isr ) , @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , recent experimental gt data on the high - lying states deduced by the more energetic projectiles shed a new light on the gt states located above one nucleon threshold , whose contributions are thought to enable us to explain the quenching problem with the high - lying gt excited states through the multi - particle and multi - hole configuration mixing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the contributions from the @xmath7 excitation and from the two - body current may be still effective for the quenching problem .    conventional approach to understand the nuclear structure </S>",
    "<S> is based on the spherical symmetry . in order to describe neutron - rich nuclei and </S>",
    "<S> their relevant nuclear reactions occurred in the nuclear processes , one needs to develop theoretical formalism including explicitly the deformation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite exploited the nilsson basis to the deformed quasi - particle random phase approximation ( dqrpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> but the two - body interaction was derived from the effective separable force . </S>",
    "<S> the realistic two - body interaction is firstly considered at ref . @xcite only with neutron - neutron ( nn ) and proton - proton ( pp ) pairing correlations which have only isospin t = 1 and j = 0 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> but , to properly describe the deformed nuclei , the t= 0 and j = 1 pairing should be also taken into account because it may easily lead to the deformation by the j = 1 pairing .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we extend our previous qrpa based on the spherical symmetry @xcite , which has been exploited as a useful framework for describing the nuclear reactions sensitive on the nuclear structure of medium - heavy and heavy nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since our dqrpa formalism is fully discussed at ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we briefly summarize the dqrpa used in this work . starting from the deformed wood saxon potential @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we transform a physical state given by the diagonalization of total hamiltonian in the nilsson basis into the spherical basis , in which one may perform more easily theoretical calculations .    in a cylindrical coordinate , </S>",

    "<S> @xmath17 is the projection of the orbital ( total ) angular momentum onto the nuclear symmetric axis @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath18 are obtained by the eigenvalue equation of the total hamiltonian in the nilsson basis .    the deformed harmonic oscillator wave function , @xmath19 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : nil ] ) can be expanded in terms of the spherical harmonic oscillator wave function @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 and the spatial overlap integral @xmath22 numerically calculated in the spherical coordinate system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the expansion can be simply written as @xmath23 with the expansion coefficient summarized as @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> the deformed bcs equation is solved by using _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ brueckner g - matrix calculated from the realistic bonn cd potential for the nucleon - nucleon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the pairing potentials @xmath25 is calculated as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is designed for the transformation to the deformed basis of the g - matrix . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 , which is a projection number of the total angular momentum @xmath29 onto the @xmath15 axis , is selected @xmath30 at the bcs stage because we consider the pairings of the quasi - particles at @xmath8 and @xmath31 states . in order to renormalize the g - matrix , strength parameters , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 </S>",

    "<S> the isr i and ii in the last column are given as @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the particle - particle ( particle - hole ) strength parameters are taken as @xmath52 for two nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> empirical pairing gaps , @xmath53 ( @xmath54)=1.561 ( 1.535 ) and 1.409 ( 1.544 ) mev , are exploited for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : result1 ]    the single particle states are used up to @xmath57 for two nuclei , in the spherical limit . </S>",
    "<S> since the gt strength distribution turns out to rely on the deformation parameter , @xmath48 @xcite , we exploited the deformation parameter , @xmath58 , as the default values . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding values of the deformation parameter @xmath48 , the renormalized strengths @xmath33 and @xmath32 , and theoretical and empirical pairing gaps are tabulated in table i. the isr i and ii , which are deviated 8% maximally from the isr , seems to be reasonable more or less , if we remind that the particle model spaces spanned by the deformed basis are finite less than 4 @xmath59 and two - body currents including @xmath7-excitation are not taken into account in this work .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting and important point to be noticed is that the @xmath60 values are abnormally deviated from 1 for some prolate @xmath48 values . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to results from the wide smearing of the fermi surface in deformed nuclei , which makes the @xmath61 coefficients for the paring gaps in eq.(3 ) small around the fermi surface and enlarges the @xmath62 to fit the empirical pairing gap . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency is explicitly revealed in the occupation probabilities of @xmath63se in fig.1 , which shows a wide smearing , _ i.e. _ significant change of the occupation probabilities of the particles around the fermi surface by the increase of the deformation parameter @xmath48 . since </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the prolate deformation usually raises the fermi surface energy , some states above the fermi surface burrowed below or around the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> for example , ( 4 3 1 1/2 ) , ( 4 2 2 3/2 ) and ( 4 1 1 3/2 ) states in @xmath56 are such cases . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to the wide smearing . </S>",
    "<S> such wide smearing of the fermi surface is also found for the protons and neutrons in @xmath44ge , as shown in fig.2 .    </S>",
    "<S> se as a function of the single particle energy given by nilsson basis for two deformation parameters @xmath48 . with the increase of @xmath48 from 0.1 to 0.2 , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy @xmath64 is increased with the wider smearing of the fermi surface . ]    </S>",
    "<S> ge . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> results for protons are shown in the left panel . ]    </S>",
    "<S> detailed changes of single particle states by the @xmath48 deformation leading to the smearing are presented in figs.3 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> some states above the fermi surface are reallocated below or around the surface , because the single particle state energies adopted from the deformed woods saxon potential depend on the parameter @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation of nuclei may be conjectured to come from macroscopic phenomena , for example , the core polarization , the high spin states and so on . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic reasons may be traced to the tensor force in the nucleon - nucleon interaction , which is known to account for the shell evolution according to the recent shell model calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , t = 0 , j = 1 pairing , which is associated with the @xmath65 tensor force , may lead to the deformation compared to the t = 1 , j = 0 pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the deformation parameter adopted in this work may include implicitly and effectively such effects , because the single particle states from the deformed wood saxon potential show strong dependence on the @xmath48 , as shown in figs . </S>",

    "<S> red dotted lines denote the fermi energy . ]    </S>",
    "<S> ge ]    we have taken @xmath67 for the particle - hole ( particle - particle ) strength parameters for the two nuclei . since the nuclei considered here are expected to have large energy gaps between proton and neutron spaces , in this work , we considered only the @xmath68 and @xmath69 pairing correlation although the formalism is presented generally . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the neutron - rich nuclei of importance in the r - process , the _ np _ pairing may not contribute so much . </S>",
    "<S> but for the p - process , the _ np _ pairing could be more important than the neutron - rich nuclei because of the adjacent energy gaps of protons and neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations for the neutron - deficient nuclei in p - process are in progress .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we show the gt strength distributions in terms of the @xmath48 parameter , as a function of excited energy of parent nuclei . </S>",

    "<S> the gt strength distributions are widely scattered due to deformation similarly to fig.5 . in particular , results for the @xmath48 = 0.35 , in which the isr i and ii are almost satisfied , nicely reproduce the peak on the high - lying excited states . </S>",
    "<S> the value calculated by rmf is 0.157 @xcite .    </S>",
