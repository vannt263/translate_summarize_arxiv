    "the beijing spectrometer ( bes ) is a general purpose solenoidal detector at the beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) storage ring , which operates at center - of - mass energies from 2 to 5 gev .",
    "the bes detector ( besii ) is described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper , we focus on studies of the @xmath0 leptonic decay , @xmath0 radiative decays",
    ", @xmath0 hadronic decays , @xmath3 decays , and @xmath1 decays based on 14 million @xmath4 and 58 million @xmath5 events collected by the besii detector .",
    "the @xmath4 provides an opportunity to compare the three lepton generations by studying the leptonic decays @xmath7 , and @xmath2 . the leptonic decay widths are approximately described by the relation @xmath8 , which is in good agreement with the besi @xmath9 measurement  @xcite .",
    "based on 14 million @xmath4 events , the branching fraction for @xmath10 is remeasured  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 pairs are reconstructed from @xmath12 and @xmath13 . at the @xmath4 resonance ,",
    "1015 signal events are observed , while 516 events are estimated to be from @xmath14 , determined using a data sample taken at @xmath15  gev .",
    "the branching fraction is calculated to be @xmath16 , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "compared with the besi result , the number of events is much bigger and the qed contribution and the efficiency and background estimations are improved .      besides the conventional meson and baryon states , qcd also predicts a rich spectrum of glueballs , meson hybrids , and multi - quark states in the 1.0 to 2.5  @xmath17 mass region .",
    "therefore , searches for evidence of these exotic states play an important role to test qcd",
    ". such studies of these states have been performed in @xmath18 radiative decays for a long time  @xcite , while studies in @xmath0 radiative decays have been limited due to low statistics in previous experiments  @xcite .",
    "the radiative decays of @xmath0 to hadrons are expected to contribute about 1% to the total @xmath0 decay width  @xcite .",
    "however , the measured channels only sum up to about 0.05%  @xcite .",
    "recently besii measured the decays of @xmath0 into @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , with the invariant mass of the hadrons ( @xmath29 ) less than 2.9 @xmath17 for each decay mode @xcite .",

    "there is a wide peak in the @xmath36 distribution located at @xmath37 @xmath17 , but its structure can not be resolved due to the low statistics .",
    "no obvious structure is observed in the other final states .",
    "the branching fractions below @xmath38 @xmath39 are given in table [ tot - nev ] , and they sum up to @xmath40 of the total @xmath0 decay width .",
