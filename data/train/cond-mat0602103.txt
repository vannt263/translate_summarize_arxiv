    "an ideal double - well lattice would allow for atoms in neighboring pairs of sites to be brought together into the same site , requiring topological control of the lattice structure .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a d - dimensional optical lattice created with no more than d+1 independent light beams is topologically stable to arbitrary changes of the relative phases of the d+1 beams .",
    "this geometry is usually preferred since phase noise ( e.g. that imparted by vibrational noise on mirrors ) will merely cause a global translation of the interference pattern . to allow for topological control , a general double - well lattice will necessarily have more than d+1 beams , but it would be desirable to preserve the topological insensitivity due to mirror - induced phase noise . to achieve vibrational phase stability in a d - dimensional lattice made with more than d+1 beams , one can actively stabilize the relative time phase between standing waves @xcite @xcite . alternatively the lattice can be constructed from a folded , retroreflected standing wave , which forces the relative time phase between standing waves to be a constant  @xcite .",

    "the beam is then retroreflected by m3 , returning a third time with wave vector @xmath5 , having traveled an additional effective distance @xmath6 . finally , it makes a fourth passage with @xmath7 , traveling again the distance @xmath3 .",
    "the total electric field for this 2d 4-beam lattice is given by re[@xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the wavelength of the lattice light ) , and @xmath15 is the polarization vector of the @xmath16 beam . in the absence of polarization rotating elements and ignoring polarization dependent phase shifts from mirrors , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "since the beam retraces the same path , there are only two independent relative phases between the four beams . as a result , the lattice is topologically stable to vibrational motion of m1 , m2 , and m3 ; variations in @xmath3 and @xmath19 result in a simple translation of the interference pattern  @xcite .",

    "in the previous section we considered idealized lattices , making assumptions about the amplitudes , wave - vectors and polarizations of the beams in the lattice . in this section",
    "we discuss considerations needed to experimentally realize the lattices described above .      for certain applications , such as the realization of the mott - insulator state @xcite , we need a nearly perfect in - plane lattice , namely a square 2d lattice with little or no energy offsets between neighboring sites .",
    "there are three primary sources of imperfections that affect the performance of the in - plane lattice : imperfect control of the input polarization ( @xmath79 ) , imperfect alignment causing the beams to be nonorthogonal , ( @xmath80 ) , and imperfect intensity balance among all four beams ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "when trying to make a perfect in - plane lattice , if the input polarization is tilted by an angle @xmath82 with respect to the @xmath83-plane , then there is a @xmath57 component to the light .",

    "the solid line is the cross section of the intensity lattice ; the dashed line is the cross section of the state dependent lattice resulting from unbalanced beam intensities .",
    "atoms in the ground state of each well are shown schematically . ]",
    "the more stringent demand for minimizing site - to - site offsets of the in - plane lattice is the orthogonality of the two standing waves . if @xmath89 , standing waves @xmath90 and @xmath91 have nonorthogonal polarization and give rise to an interference term in the total intensity , thus causing an energy offset between neighboring sites given by @xmath92 for small @xmath93 ( fig . [ imperfections]a ) .",
    "this imperfection has the same effect as imperfect input polarization , but is harder to minimize since it scales linearly with @xmath93 .",
    "for example , a misalignment of 10 mrad will cause a 4% modulation of the trap depth .",
    "we describe below how to control both imperfections .",
    "the third source of imperfections for the in - plane lattice is the intensity imbalance between the four beams .",
    "experimentally , intensity imbalance can arise from reflection and transmission losses along the beam path as well as from unequal beam waists at the intersection .",
    "in general , light imbalance breaks the symmetry between the @xmath94 and @xmath95 direction , which removes the degeneracy between the vibrational excitations along @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "typically , this does not adversely affect the lattice .",
    "we also note that since the beam experiences the same losses while traversing @xmath3 each time , then for equal beam waists @xmath96 , and the losses do not produce well asymmetries .",
    "a more important consequence of intensity imbalance is that the total field is not everywhere linearly polarized , but rather has some ellipticity , @xmath97 \\hat{z}.       \\label{pol_diff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this causes a state dependent spatially varying vector light shift with period @xmath14 , even in the absence of the out - of - plane lattice . as evident from eq .",
    "[ pol_diff ] , for perfect intensity balance the ellipticity will vanish , resulting in purely linear polarization . comparing eq .",
    "[ ixy ] with eq .",
    "[ pol_diff ] one can see that the phase of the polarization lattice is spatially out of phase with the intensity lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ imperfections]b ) resulting in a state dependent barrier height between lattice sites , with relatively little modification of the potential near the minima .      in general ,",
    "the structure of the out - of - plane lattice is fairly robust against the three imperfections mentioned above .",
    "a minor consequence of field imbalance is the possible disappearance of perfect nodal lines .",
    "one finds , for example , that at the position of the nodal line intersection , the intensity becomes @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the electric constant ( permittivity of free space ) , and @xmath100 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "there are exact nodes when @xmath101 , and this condition is trivially satisfied when the light fields are balanced .",
    "as with the in - plane lattice , degeneracies of vibrational excitations are lifted when the intensities are imbalanced .      a composite in - plane and out - of - plane lattice can be made by adjusting the angle @xmath82 to control the admixture of the two components .",
    "for the combined lattice , the consequences and control of imperfections are similar to the in - plane lattice . with the added flexibility to control intensity and relative phase , we can in fact use @xmath82 and @xmath102 to compensate for @xmath103 ( at least for a given magnetic sub - level ) .",
    "the vector light shift for an intensity imbalanced double - well lattice is somewhat more complicated ( yet easily calculable ) , having position dependent ellipticity along @xmath2 , @xmath43 and @xmath57 .",
    "many experiments are carried out in the presence of a spatially uniform bias field @xmath30 , so that the total field seen by the atoms is given by the vector sum @xmath104 . for @xmath105 ,",
    "the direction of the quantization axis remains nearly constant along @xmath30 throughout the lattice .",
    "the magnitude of the state dependent shift in this limit is proportional to @xmath106 and only the component of @xmath107 along @xmath30 contributes to the potential .",
    "the ability to adjust the direction of @xmath30 provides significant flexibility in designing state - dependent potentials , and allows for state dependent motion of atoms between the two sites of the double - well .",

    "[ band_map ] .",
    "as expected the bands are different for the different lattices .",
    "this is clear evidence that we have two distinct lattices with distinct momentum components .",
    "as an example of the dynamic control of the double well lattice , we demonstrate coherent splitting of atoms from single wells into double wells . initially , we load into the ground band of the out - of - plane lattice .",
    "the time scale for loading ( 100 ms ) is sufficiently slow to ensure dephasing of atoms in neighboring sites .",
    "if at this point in time we suddenly turn off the lattice and allow 13 ms tof , we observe a single , broad momentum distribution , shown in fig .",
    "[ fringes]a .",
    "since atoms on separate sites have random relative phases , this distribution is an incoherent sum of `` single - slit '' diffraction patterns from each of the localized ground state wavefunctions in the out - of - plane lattice .",

    "we start with the ground - loaded out - of - plane lattice , then dynamically raise the barrier to transfer the atoms into the symmetric double well lattice .",
    "the barrier is raised in 200 @xmath123s by increasing the ratio of @xmath70 with eom@xmath82 , while eom@xmath124 is set to @xmath176 . by observing the double slit diffraction pattern ( fig . [ fringes]b ) and adjusting @xmath69 until the diffraction pattern is symmetric . for @xmath177 the diffraction pattern would be shifted to the right or left . ]",
    "this timescale is chosen to be slow enough to avoid vibrational excitations but fast enough to maintain phase coherence within a double well .",
    "since there is no phase coherence from one double well to another , the resulting momentum distribution is an incoherent sum of essentially identical double - slit diffraction patterns ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fringes]b ) from each of the wavefunctions localized in individual double wells .",
    "the ability to isolate individual atoms in controllable double well potentials is essential for testing a variety of neutral atom based quantum gate proposals .",
    "two - qubit gate ideas typically involve state dependent motion @xcite or controlled state dependent interaction @xcite , but nearly all require the ability to move atoms into very near proximity ( e.g. into the same site ) and subsequently to separate them .",
    "the flexibility and dynamic control of the double well lattice can be used to demonstrate and test motion of atoms between wells .",
    "furthermore , state dependence of the barrier height can be used for state dependent motion between wells , allowing for the possibility of 2-atom gates .    in conclusion",
    "we have demonstrated a dynamically controllable double - well lattice .",
    "the geometry of this lattice is topologically phase stable against vibrational noise , yet allows topological control of the lattice structure .",
    "the design of the double well lattice allows for flexible real - time control of its properties : the tilt and the tunnel barrier between sites within the double well .",
