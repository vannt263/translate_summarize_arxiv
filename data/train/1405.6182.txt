    "in the presence of extraordinarily strong gauge fields , we encounter essentially new phenomena that are not observed in the vacuum .",
    "such phenomena are collectively called  strong - field physics , \" which has been attracting the attention of many researchers in various fields in physics @xcite .",
    "there are intense laser facilities planned around the world ; in addition , compact stars and relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions offer unique opportunities to study the strong - field phenomena . even for a system with a small coupling constant ,",
    "the physics becomes nonperturbative because the smallness of the coupling constant is compensated by the strong background field strength , which requires some sort of resummations of higher - order contributions .",
    "such nonperturbative nature of interactions between particles and fields is one of the outstanding properties of strong - field physics . at the same time",
    ", it is an important issue to understand the transition from the perturbative to the nonperturbative regime with increasing the strength of the fields and/or with changing other parameters .",
    "this is relevant also to experiments for realizing the setups for strong - field physics .",
    "the present paper is devoted to clarifying the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of the phenomena under strong fields .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider a system described by qed in a very strong electric field @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electron mass @xcite .",
    "in such a system , propagation of an electron significantly differs from that of the bare one because it receives large corrections from the strong field . from a naive dimensional argument",
    ", the propagation of an electron acquires corrections of the order of @xmath16^n)$ ] if it receives @xmath17 kicks from the strong field .",
    "therefore , for @xmath14 , the higher - order interactions are not suppressed and the propagation of an electron bears nonperturbative nature .",
    "typical examples of the nonperturbative phenomena include the schwinger mechanism @xcite , i.e. , spontaneous production of @xmath18 pairs from the vacuum ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "intuitively it is understood as the process where a virtual @xmath18 pair produced as a vacuum fluctuation is kicked many times by the strong field so that they obtain enough energy to become a real pair .",
    "formally , an imaginary part appears in the effective action of the background fields ( the euler - heisenberg action @xcite ) only after summing up the electron s one - loop diagrams with infinitely many insertions of the external fields .",
    "the total number of created electrons in case of a constant electric background field with infinite duration is given by @xmath19 whose dependence on @xmath20 clearly indicates nonperturbative nature of the schwinger mechanism @xcite .",
    "another aspect of strong fields which becomes important in actual physical situations is the temporal dependence of the fields . as far as a strong electric field",
    "is concerned , it is not realistic to keep it for a long time compared to the typical time scale of the system .",
    "for example , electric fields produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions decay quite fast .",
    "those in intense lasers are also time dependent . based on the intuitive picture that charged particles receive quantum corrections by kicks from the strong fields",
    ", one may expect that the number of kicks from the fields depends on the field lifetime .",
    "indeed , perturbative calculation may be justified for a short - lived pulse field like a shock wave or a spike .",
    "thus , we need to study carefully whether the process should be described in a perturbative or nonperturbative way for the pair creation in the presence of time - dependent strong fields .",
    "this is the problem we are going to address in the present paper .    before going into the details ,",
    "let us briefly explain here how the finite duration of the fields modifies our intuitive picture for the pair creation in the background field . in a static and homogeneous electric field ,",
    "the system has only two dimensionful parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath15 . as mentioned above ,",
    "a criterion for pair creation from the vacuum is then given by @xmath21 .",
    "this is also understood in the following way .",
    "pair creation will become possible if the work , @xmath22 , done by the field on a virtual electron / positron for a distance @xmath23 is at least of the same order as the electron mass . since this must happen within the lifetime of pair fluctuation , the distance @xmath23 is identified with the compton length @xmath24 .",
    "however , when the external electric field is time dependent , we have another dimensionful parameter @xmath2 , namely , a typical duration of the field . in the static field case ,",
    "we care only the lifetime of the fluctuation , but now we need to deal with the two time scales : @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",
    "we will find that two dimensionless parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are relevant for this time dependent case , and can discuss the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative physics with the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , we can study the interplay in detail by using the sauter - type electric field @xmath30 which allows analytic calculation for the schwinger mechanism .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we provide perturbative and nonperturbative formulations for the @xmath7 pair creation in a time - dependent electric field without specifying any temporal profile . in section 3 , we take the sauter - type field as an example of pulsed electric fields and compute the number densities of produced electrons in both formulations .",
    "then , we compare the two results .",
    "a summary is given in the last section .",
    "the purpose of this section is to present a general expression for the number of electrons created from the vacuum in the presence of a time - dependent electric field . to this aim , we consider the following qed lagrangian : @xmath31\\psi    - e\\bar{\\psi}{{\\ooalign{\\hfil/\\hfil\\crcr$\\bar{a}$ } } } \\psi       \\equiv { \\mathcal l}_0 + { \\mathcal l}_{\\rm bg } \\ , .",

    "notice that this is a nonperturbative calculation because we include the interaction of electrons or positrons with the electric fields up to infinite order .",

    "one may simply understand this fact ( [ 2bog ] ) in analogy with an one - dimensional barrier scattering problem where we always have a mixture of in - coming wave and its reflection on one side of the barrier , but the other side consists of out - going wave only .",

    "notice that we have not specified the time dependence of the background field @xmath70 so far and thus eq .  ( [ eq26 ] ) is a general formula .",

    "notice first that the perturbative result always approaches 0 in the long pulse limit @xmath144 because the typical energies of a ( virtual ) photon which forms the sauter - type field @xmath145 for large @xmath2 and thus not enough to create a pair . on the other hand",
    ", schwinger s formula valid in the long pulse region says that pair creation for subcritical field strength is exponentially suppressed @xmath146 .",

    "figure  [ fig3_taudep ] also shows an interesting behavior .",
    "for relatively short pulses @xmath147 with subcritical field strength @xmath148 ( left panel ) , the results of the sauter - type field are enhanced as compared to schwinger s value ( horizontal lines ) .",
    "since the pair creation in this region is dominated by the perturbative contribution , this enhancement should be understood as a purely perturbative effect .",
    "it shows up because schwinger s nonperturbative result @xmath146 is exponentially small for subcritical field strength @xmath139 , while the perturbative result is only power - suppressed as @xmath149 ( see eq .",

[ fig7 ] as a function of the field strength @xmath138 , together with schwinger s value and the peak value of the perturbative contribution . the extrapolation of schwinger s value to the weak field case @xmath139 underestimates the pair creation in the sauter - type pulsed field ; the pair creation from the vacuum in the region @xmath157 is actually more abundant than schwinger s value , owing to the perturbative contribution with a single photon .",

    "it is interesting to compare our discussion with ref .",
    "@xcite , which claims that the keldysh parameter @xmath177 , where @xmath65 is the typical frequency of the background field , discriminates whether the system is perturbative or nonperturbative .",
    "note that their discussion is limited to the case where ( i ) an oscillating electric field background @xmath178 , ( ii ) @xmath65 is sufficiently small compared to the electron mass @xmath179 , and ( iii ) the background field is sufficiently weak @xmath180 .",
    "if we assume that the typical frequency @xmath65 of a pulsed background field is given by the inverse of the pulse duration @xmath113 , we find that our discussion obtained in a pulsed background field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) agrees with ref .  @xcite",
    "as long as the limitation ( iii ) is satisfied . in such a condition",
    ", @xmath28 determines the  perturbativeness \" of the system in our discussion and is equivalent to the keldysh parameter because @xmath181 .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated that , by using the sauter - type electric field , an interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative effects for the @xmath7 pair creation from the time - dependent electric field is controlled by two dimensionless parameters @xmath182 and @xmath27 .",
    "perturbative pair creation occurs when @xmath183 is satisfied , while nonperturbative pair creation ( the schwinger mechanism ) occurs when @xmath184 is satisfied . in particular ,",
    "an enhancement of the electron number density seen when the pulse duration and the field strength is relatively short @xmath147 and weak @xmath139 , respectively , can be understood as the lowest order perturbative process with a single photon .    throughout this paper",
    ", we considered the case where the background field is described by the sauter - type pulse in order to explicitly perform an analytic calculation .",
    "however , we stress that our qualitative discussion should be valid for more general pulse fields smoothly characterized by its height @xmath1 and width @xmath2 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , though we focused on the pulse in _ time _ in this paper , our analysis implies that the finite _ space _ extension would also affect the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of the phenomena under strong fields .",
    "our analysis is instructive when we consider the effects of time - dependent strong fields in actual physical situations .",
    "let us briefly discuss the case in high - energy heavy - ion collisions as an example .",
    "it is estimated that a very strong field @xmath185 is generated in heavy - ion collisions operated in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "( a ) in noncentral collisions such that two nuclei can touch each other , numerical simulations@xcite have shown that its strength is of the order of @xmath186 for rhic and @xmath187 for lhc , where @xmath188 is the pion mass .",
    "( b ) in the ultraperipheral collisions where two nuclei do not touch each other , the electric field is still very strong and is estimated as @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the impact parameter and @xmath191 is the lorentz factor . with modest parameters , the strength of the field reaches @xmath192 for rhic ( @xmath193 ) and @xmath194 for lhc ( @xmath195 ) . at first sight",
    ", it might be natural to expect there exists nonperturbative strong field effects such as the schwinger mechanism because the field is extremely strong @xmath196 .",
    "however , from the analysis of the present paper , we have learned that we need to be careful about the finite lifetime of the strong fields .",
    "indeed , the duration @xmath2 of the strong field is extremely short when compared to the typical energy scale of the system @xmath15 : @xmath197 .",
    "for instance , a rough estimate yields @xmath198 ( rhic , lhc ) for case ( a ) and @xmath199 ( rhic ; @xmath200 ) and @xmath201 ( lhc ; @xmath202 ) for case ( b ) . with such short durations ,",
    "the important parameter @xmath28 can be large @xmath203 ; however , @xmath29 is always so small @xmath204 that the pair creation in these processes is no longer nonperturbative and the perturbative treatment would be sufficient . however , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for case ( a ) , the matter created in the collisions could let the electric field survive longer than the naive estimation .",
    "if this is the case , there is a possibility that pair creation could be nonperturbative .",
    "this work was supported in part by the center for the promotion of integrated sciences ( cpis ) of sokendai and grants - in - aid for scientific research of mext [ ( c)24540255 ] .",
    "let us find an asymptotic expression of @xmath205 ( [ eq222 ] ) for @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
