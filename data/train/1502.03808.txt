    "at a summer school in les houches france in summer 1972 , james bardeen @xcite , building on earlier work of brandon carter @xcite , initiated research on gravitational lensing by spinning black holes .",
    "bardeen gave a thorough analytical analysis of null geodesics ( light - ray propagation ) around a spinning black hole ; and , as part of his analysis , he computed how a black hole s spin affects the shape of the shadow that the hole casts on light from a distant star field .",
    "the shadow bulges out on the side of the hole moving away from the observer , and squeezes inward and flattens on the side moving toward the observer .",
    "the result , for a maximally spinning hole viewed from afar , is a d - shaped shadow ; cf .",
    "figure [ fig4:kerrlens ] below .",
    "( when viewed up close , the shadow s flat edge has a shallow notch cut out of it , as hinted by figure [ fig8:nofingerprint ] below . )    despite this early work , gravitational lensing by black holes remained a backwater of physics research until decades later , when the prospect for actual observations brought it to the fore .",
    "there were , we think , two especially memorable accomplishments in the backwater era .",
    "the first was a 1978 simulation of what a camera sees as it orbits a non - spinning black hole , with a star field in the background .",
    "this simulation was carried out by leigh palmer , maurice pryce and bill unruh @xcite on an evans and sutherland vector graphics display at simon fraser university .",
    "palmer , pryce and unruh did not publish their simulation , but they showed a film clip from it in a number of lectures in that era .",
    "the nicest modern - era film clip of this same sort that we know of is by alain riazuelo ( contained in his dvd @xcite and available on the web at @xcite ) ; see figure [ fig3:schrays ] and associated discussion below . and see @xcite for an online application by thomas mller and daniel weiskopf for generating similar film clips . also of much interest in our modern era are film clips by andrew hamilton @xcite of what a camera sees when falling into a nonspinning black hole ; these have been shown at many planetariums , and elsewhere .",
    "the other most memorable backwater - era accomplishment was a black and white simulation by jean - pierre luminet @xcite of what a thin accretion disk , gravitationally lensed by a nonspinning black hole , would look like as seen from far away but close enough to resolve the image . in figure",
    "[ fig15:disk]c below , we show a modern - era colour version of this , with the camera close to a fast - spinning black hole .    gravitational lensing by black holes began to be observationally important in the 1990s .",
    "kevin rauch and roger blandford @xcite recognised that , when a hot spot , in a black hole s accretion disk or jet , passes through caustics of the earth s past light cone ( caustics produced by the hole s spacetime curvature ) , the brightness of the hot spot s x - rays will undergo sharp oscillations with informative shapes .",
    "this has motivated a number of quantitative studies of the kerr metric s caustics ; see , especially @xcite and references therein .",
    "these papers caustics are relevant for a source near the black hole and an observer far away , on earth  in effect , on the black hole s `` celestial sphere '' at radius @xmath0 . in our paper , by contrast , we are interested in light sources that are usually on the celestial sphere and an observer or camera near the black hole . for this reversed case , we shall discuss the relevant caustics in sections [ subsec : kerrouter ] and [ subsec : fingerprint ] .",
    "this case has been little studied , as it is of primarily cultural interest (  everyone \" wants to know what it would look like to live near a black hole , but nobody expects to make such observations in his or her lifetime ) , and of science - fiction interest .",
    "our paper initiates the detailed study of this culturally interesting case ; but we leave a full , systematic study to future research .",
    "most importantly , we keep our camera outside the ergosphere  by contrast with alain riazuelo s @xcite and hamilton s @xcite recent simulations with cameras deep inside the ergosphere and even plunging through the horizon .    in the 1990s",
    "astrophysicists began to envision an era in which very long baseline interferometry would make possible the imaging of black holes  specifically , their shadows and their accretion disks .",
    "this motivated visualizations , with ever increasing sophistication , of accretion disks around black holes : modern variants of luminet s @xcite pioneering work .",
    "see , especially , fukue and yokoyama @xcite , who added colours to the disk ; viergutz @xcite , who made his black hole spin , treated thick disks , and produced particularly nice and interesting coloured images and included the disk s secondary image which wraps under the black hole ; marck @xcite , who laid the foundations for a lovely movie now available on the web @xcite with the camera moving around close to the disk , and who also included higher - order images , as did fanton et .",
    "@xcite and beckwith and done @xcite .",
    "see also papers cited in these articles .    in the 2000s astrophysicists",
    "have focused on perfecting the mm - interferometer imaging of black - hole shadows and disks , particularly the black hole at the centre of our own milky way galaxy ( sgr a * ) .",
    "see , e.g. , the 2000 feasibility study by falcke , melia and agol @xcite . see also references on the development and exploitation of grmhd ( general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical ) simulation codes for modelling accretion disks like that in sgr a * @xcite ; and references on detailed grmhd models of sgr a * and the models comparison with observations @xcite .",
    "this is culminating in a mm interferometric system called the _ event horizon telescope _",
    "@xcite , which is beginning to yield interesting observational results though not yet full images of the shadow and disk in sgr a*.    all the astrophysical visualizations of gravitational lensing and accretion disks described above , and all others that we are aware of , are based on tracing huge numbers of light rays through curved spacetime . a primary goal of today s state - of - the - art , astrophysical ray - tracing codes ( e.g. , the chan , psaltis and zel s massively parallel , gpu - based code gray @xcite ) is very fast throughput , measured , e.g. , in integration steps per second ; the spatial smoothness of images has been only a secondary concern . for our _ interstellar _ work , by contrast",
    ", a primary goal is smoothness of the images , so flickering is minimised when objects move rapidly across an imax screen ; fast throughput has been only a secondary concern .    with these different primary goals , in our own code ,",
    "called dngr , we have been driven to employ a different set of visualization techniques from those of the astrophysics community  techniques based on propagation of ray bundles ( light beams ) instead of discrete light rays , and on carefully designed spatial filtering to smooth the overlaps of neighbouring beams ; see section [ sec : dngr ] and [ sec : app ] .",
    "although , at double negative , we have many gpu - based workstations , the bulk of our computational work is done on a large compute cluster ( the double negative render - farm ) that does not employ gpus .    in [ app : comparecodes ] we shall give additional comparisons of our dngr code with astrophysical codes and with other film - industry cgi codes .      our work on gravitational lensing by black holes",
    "began in may 2013 , when christopher nolan asked us to collaborate on building realistic images of a spinning black hole and its disk , with imax resolution , for his science fiction movie _ interstellar_. we saw this not only as an opportunity to bring realistic black holes into the hollywood arena , but also an opportunity to create a simulation code capable of exploring a black hole s lensing with a level of image smoothness and dynamics not previously available .    to achieve imax quality ( with 23 million pixels per image and adequately smooth transitions between pixels ) , our code needed to integrate not only rays ( photon trajectories ) from the light source to the simulated camera , but also bundles of rays ( light beams ) with filtering to smooth the beams overlap ; see section [ sec : dngr ] , [ subsec : app - raybundle ] , and [ subsec : app - filtering ] . and because the camera would sometimes be moving with speeds that are a substantial fraction of the speed of light , our code needed to incorporate relativistic aberration as well as doppler shifts and gravitational redshifts .",
    "thorne , having had a bit of experience with this kind of stuff , put together a step - by - step prescription for how to map a light ray and ray bundle from the light source ( the celestial sphere or an accretion disk ) to the camera s local sky ; see [ subsec : app - raytrace ] and [ subsec : app - raybundle ] .",
    "he implemented his prescription in mathematica to be sure it produced images in accord with others prior simulations and his own intuition .",
    "he then turned his prescription over to our double negative team , who created the fast , high - resolution code dngr that we describe in section [ sec : dngr ] and [ sec : app ] , and created the images to be lensed : fields of stars and in some cases also dust clouds , nebulae , and the accretion disk around _",
    "interstellar _ s black hole , gargantua .    in section [ sec : starfield ]",
    ", we use this code to explore a few interesting aspects of the lensing of a star field as viewed by a camera that moves around a fast - spinning black hole ( 0.999 of maximal  a value beyond which natural spin - down processes become strong @xcite ) .",
    "we compute the intersection of the celestial sphere @xmath1 ) with the primary , secondary , and tertiary caustics of the camera s past light cone and explore how the sizes and shapes of the resulting caustic curves change as the camera moves closer to the hole and as we go from the primary caustic to higher - order caustics .",
    "we compute the images of the first three caustics on the camera s local sky ( the first three critical curves ) , and we explore in detail the creation and annihilation of stellar - image pairs , on the secondary critical curve , when a star passes twice through the secondary caustic . we examine the tracks of stellar images on the camera s local sky as the camera orbits the black hole in its equatorial plane .",
    "and we discover and explain why , as seen by a camera orbiting a fast spinning black hole in our galaxy , there is just one image of the galactic plane between adjacent critical curves near the poles of the black hole s shadow , but there are multiple images between critical curves near the flat , equatorial shadow edge .",
    "the key to this from one viewpoint is the fact that higher - order caustics wrap around the celestial sphere multiple times , and from another viewpoint the key is light rays temporarily trapped in prograde , almost circular orbits around the black hole . by placing a checkerboard of paint swatches on the celestial sphere ,",
    "we explore in detail the overall gravitational lensing patterns seen by a camera near a fast - spinning black hole and the influence of aberration due to the camera s motion .    whereas most of section [ sec : starfield ] on lensing of stellar images is new , in the context of a camera near the hole and stars far away , our section [ sec : disk ] , on lensing of an accretion disk , retreads largely known ground .",
    "but it does so in the context of the movie _ interstellar _ , to help readers understand the movie s black - hole images , and does so in a manner that may be pedagogically interesting .",
    "we begin with a picture of a gravitationally lensed disk made of equally spaced paint swatches .",
    "this picture is useful for understanding the multiple images of the disk that wrap over and under and in front of the hole s shadow .",
    "we then replace the paint - swatch disk by a fairly realistic and rather thin disk ( though one constructed by double negative artists instead of by solving astrophysicists equations for thin accretion disks @xcite ) .",
    "we first compute the lensing of our semi - realistic disk but ignore doppler shifts and gravitational redshifts , which we then turn on pedagogically in two steps : the colour shifts and then the intensity shifts .",
    "we discuss why christopher nolan and paul franklin chose to omit the doppler shifts in the movie , and chose to slow the black hole s spin from that , @xmath2 , required to explain the huge time losses in _ interstellar _ , to @xmath3 .",
    "and we then discuss and add simulated lens flare ( light scattering and diffraction in the camera s lenses ) for an imax camera that observes the disk  something an astrophysicist would not want to do because it hides the physics of the disk and the lensed galaxy beyond it , but that is standard in movies , so computer generated images will have continuity with images shot by real cameras .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we summarise and we point to our use of dngr to produce images of gravitational lensing by wormholes .    throughout",
    "we use geometrized units in which @xmath4 ( newton s gravitation constant ) and @xmath5 ( the speed of light ) are set to unity , and we use the mtw sign conventions @xcite .",
    "our computer code for making images of what a camera would see in the vicinity of a black hole or wormhole is called the double negative gravitational renderer , or dngr  which obviously can also be interpreted as the double negative general relativistic code .     onto the celestial sphere @xmath6 via",
    "a backward directed light ray ; and the evolution of a ray bundle , that is circular at the camera , backward along the ray to its origin , an ellipse on the celestial sphere . ]",
    "the ray tracing part of dngr produces a map from the celestial sphere ( or the surface of an accretion disk ) to the camera s local sky .",
    "more specifically ( see [ subsec : app - raytrace ] for details and figure [ fig1:skymapa ] for the ray - tracing geometry ) :    1 .   in dngr",
    ", we adopt boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath7 for the black hole s kerr spacetime . at each event",
    "we introduce the locally non - rotating observer , also called the fiducial observer or fido in the membrane paradigm @xcite : the observer whose 4-velocity is orthogonal to the surfaces of constant @xmath8 , the kerr metric s space slices .",
    "we regard the fido as _ at rest _ in space , and give the fido orthonormal basis vectors , @xmath9 , that point along the spatial coordinate lines . 2 .",
    "we specify the camera s coordinate location @xmath10 ; its direction of motion relative to the fido there , a unit vector @xmath11 in the camera s reference frame ; and the camera s speed @xmath12 relative to the fido .",
    "3 .   in the camera s reference frame",
    ", we set up a right - handed set of three orthonormal basis vectors @xmath13 , with @xmath14 along the direction of the camera s motion , @xmath15 perpendicular to @xmath16 and in the plane spanned by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 orthogonal to @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "see figure [ fig1:skymapa ] .",
    "and we then set up a spherical polar coordinate system @xmath20 for the camera s local sky ( i.e.  for the directions of incoming light rays ) in the usual manner dictated by the camera s cartesian basis vectors @xmath13 .",
    "4 .   for a ray that originates on the celestial sphere ( at @xmath0 )",
    ", we denote the boyer - lindquist angular location at which it originates by @xmath21 .",
    "we integrate the null geodesic equation to propagate the ray from the camera to the celestial sphere , thereby obtaining the map @xmath22 of points on the camera s local sky to points on the celestial sphere .",
    "if the ray originates on the surface of an accretion disk , we integrate the null geodesic equation backward from the camera until it hits the disk s surface , and thereby deduce the map from a point on the disk s surface to one on the camera s sky . for more details on this case ,",
    "see [ subsec : dngrdisks ] . 7 .",
    "we also compute , using the relevant doppler shift and gravitational redshift , the net frequency shift from the ray s source to the camera , and the corresponding net change in light intensity .",
    "dngr achieves its imax - quality images by integrating a bundle of light rays ( a light beam ) backward along the null geodesic from the camera to the celestial sphere using a slightly modified variant of a procedure formulated in the 1970s by serge pineault and robert roeder @xcite .",
    "this procedure is based on the equation of geodesic deviation and is equivalent to the optical scalar equations @xcite that have been widely used by astrophysicists in analytical ( but not numerical ) studies of gravitational lensing ; see references in section 2.3 of @xcite .",
    "our procedure , in brief outline , is this ( see figure [ fig1:skymapa ] ) ; for full details , see [ subsec : app - raybundle ] .    1 .   in dngr , we begin with an initially circular ( or sometimes initially elliptical ) bundle of rays , with very small opening angle , centred on a pixel on the camera s sky .",
    "2 .   we integrate the equation of geodesic deviation backward in time along the bundle s central ray to deduce the ellipse on the celestial sphere from which the ray bundle comes . more specifically , we compute the angle @xmath23 that the ellipse s major axis makes with the celestial sphere s @xmath24 direction , and the ellipse s major and minor angular diameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the celestial sphere .",
    "3 .   we then add up the spectrum and intensity of all the light emitted from within that ellipse ; and thence , using the frequency and intensity shifts that were computed by ray tracing , we deduce the spectrum and intensity of the light arriving in the chosen camera pixel .",
    "novel types of filtering are key to generating our imax - quality images for movies . in dngr",
    "we use spatial filtering to smooth the interfaces between beams ( ray bundles ) , and temporal filtering to make dynamical images look like they were filmed with a movie camera . for details , see [ subsec : app - filtering ] .    in [ subsec :",
    "app - implementation ] we describe some details of our dngr implementation of the ray - tracing , ray - bundle , and filtering equations ; in [ subsec : app - codefarm ] we describe some characteristics of our code and of double negative s linux - based render - farm on which we do our computations ; in [ subsec : dngrdisks ] we describe our dngr modelling of accretion disks ; and in [ app : comparecodes ] we briefly compare dngr with other film - industry cgi codes and state - of - the - art astrophysical simulation codes .",
    "in this subsection we review well known features of gravitational lensing by a nonspinning ( schwarzschild ) black hole , in preparation for discussing the same things for a fast - spinning hole .",
    "we begin , pedagogically , with a still from a film clip by alain riazuelo @xcite , figure [ fig2:schlens ] .",
    "the camera , at radius @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the black hole s mass ) is moving in a circular geodesic orbit around the black hole , with a star field on the celestial sphere .",
    "we focus on two stars , which each produce two images on the camera s sky .",
    "we place red circles around the images of the brighter star and yellow diamonds around those of the dimmer star . as the camera orbits the hole , the images move around the camera s sky along the red and yellow curves .    .",
    "picture courtesy alain riazuelo , from his film clip @xcite ; coloured markings by us . ]",
    "images outside the einstein ring ( the violet circle ) move rightward and deflect away from the ring .",
    "these are called _",
    "primary images_. images inside the einstein ring ( _ secondary images _ ) appear , in the film clip , to emerge from the edge of the black hole s shadow , loop leftward around the hole , and descend back into the shadow .",
    "however , closer inspection with higher resolution reveals that their tracks actually close up along the shadow s edge as shown in the figure ; the close - up is not seen in the film clip because the images are so very dim along the inner leg of their tracks . at all times ,",
    "each star s two images are on opposite sides of the shadow s centre .",
    "this behaviour is generic .",
    "every star ( if idealised as a point source of light ) , except a set of measure zero , has two images that behave in the same manner as the red and yellow ones .",
    "outside the einstein ring , the entire primary star field flows rightward , deflecting around the ring ; inside the ring , the entire secondary star field loops leftward , confined by the ring then back rightward along the shadow s edge .",
    "( there actually are more , unseen , images of the star field , even closer to the shadow s edge , that we shall discuss in section [ subsec : kerrstarfield ] . )    . ]    as is well known , this behaviour is easily understood by tracing light rays from the camera to the celestial sphere ; see figure [ fig3:schrays ] .",
    "the einstein ring is the image , on the camera s sky , of a point source that is on the celestial sphere , diametrically opposite the camera ; i.e. , at the location indicated by the red dot and labeled  caustic \" in figure [ fig3:schrays ] .",
    "light rays from that caustic point generate the purple ray surface that converges on the camera , and the einstein ring is the intersection of that ray surface with the camera s local sky .",
    "[ the caustic point ( red dot ) is actually the intersection of the celestial sphere with a caustic line ( a one - dimensional sharp edge ) on the camera s past light cone .",
    "this caustic line extends radially from the black hole s horizon to the caustic point . ]",
    "the figure shows a single star ( black dot ) on the celestial sphere and two light rays that travel from that star to the camera , gravitationally deflecting around opposite sides of the black hole .",
    "one of these rays , the primary one , arrives at the camera outside the einstein ring ; the other , secondary ray , arrives inside the einstein ring .    because the caustic point and the star on the celestial sphere both have dimension zero , as the camera moves , causing the caustic point to move relative to the star , there is zero probability for it to pass through the star .",
    "therefore , the star s two images will never cross the einstein ring ; one will remain forever outside it and the other inside  and similarly for all other stars in the star field .",
    "however , if a star with finite size passes close to the ring , the gravitational lensing will momentarily stretch its two images into lenticular shapes that hug the einstein ring and will produce a great , temporary increase in each image s energy flux at the camera due to the temporary increase in the total solid angle subtended by each lenticular image .",
    "this increase in flux still occurs when the star s actual size is too small for its images to be resolved , and also in the limit of a point star . for examples ,",
    "see riazuelo s film clip @xcite .",
    "( large amplifications of extended images are actually seen in nature , for example in the gravitational lensing of distant galaxies by more nearby galaxies or galaxy clusters ; see , e.g. , @xcite . )      , as seen by a camera in a circular , equatorial geodesic orbit at radius @xmath29 .",
    "the red curves are the trajectories of primary images , on the camera s sky , for stars at celestial - sphere latitudes @xmath30 .",
    "the yellow curves are the trajectories of secondary images for stars at @xmath31 .",

    "we show a few film clips from these simulations at @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig4:kerrlens ] is a still from one of those film clips , in which the hole has spin @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the hole s spin angular momentum per unit mass and @xmath28 is its mass ) , and the camera moves along a circular , equatorial , geodesic orbit at radius @xmath29 .    in the figure we show in violet two critical curves ",
    "analogs of the einstein ring for a nonspinning black hole .",
    "these are images , on the camera sky , of two caustic curves that reside on the celestial sphere ; see discussion below .",
    "we shall discuss in turn the region outside the secondary ( inner ) critical curve , and then the region inside .",
    "as the camera moves through one full orbit around the hole , the stellar images in the outer region make one full circuit along the red and yellow curves and other curves like them , largely avoiding the two critical curves of figure [ fig4:kerrlens]particularly the outer ( primary ) one .",
    "we denote by five - pointed symbols four images of two very special stars : stars that reside where the hole s spin axis intersects the celestial sphere , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "these are analogs of the earth s star polaris . by symmetry",
    ", these pole - star images must remain fixed on the camera s sky as the camera moves along its circular equatorial orbit . outside the _ primary ( outer ) critical curve _ ,",
    "all northern - hemisphere stellar images ( images with @xmath38 ) circulate clockwise around the lower red pole - star image , and southern - hemisphere stellar images , counterclockwise around the upper red pole - star image . between the primary and secondary ( inner ) critical curves ,",
    "the circulations are reversed , so at the primary critical curve there is a divergent shear in the image flow .",
    "[ for a nonspinning black hole ( figure [ fig2:schlens ] above ) there are also two critical curves , with the stellar - image motions confined by them : the einstein ring , and a circular inner critical curve very close to the black hole s shadow , that prevents the inner star tracks from plunging into the shadow and deflects them around the shadow so they close up . ]      after seeing these stellar - image motions in our simulations , we explored the nature of the critical curves and caustics for a camera near a fast - spinning black hole , and their influence .",
    "our exploration , conceptually , is a rather straightforward generalisation of ideas laid out by rauch and blandford @xcite and by bozza @xcite .",
    "they studied a camera or observer on the celestial sphere and light sources orbiting a black hole ; our case is the inverse : a camera orbiting the hole and light sources on the celestial sphere .    just as the einstein ring , for a nonspinning black hole , is the image of a caustic point on the celestial sphere  the intersection of the celestial sphere with a caustic line on the camera s past light cone ",
    "so the critical curves for our spinning black hole are also images of the intersection of the celestial sphere with light - cone caustics . but the spinning hole s light - cone caustics generically are 2-dimensional surfaces ( folds ) in the three - dimensional light cone , so their intersections with the celestial sphere are one - dimensional : they are closed _",
    "caustic curves _ in the celestial sphere , rather than caustic points .",
    "the hole s rotation breaks spherical symmetry and converts non - generic caustic points into generic caustic curves .",
    "( for this reason , theorems about caustics in the schwarzschild spacetime , which are rather easy to prove , are of minor importance compared to results about generic caustics in the kerr spacetime . )",
    "we have computed the caustic curves , for a camera near a spinning black hole , by propagating ray bundles backward from a fine grid of points on the camera s local sky , and searching for points on the celestial sphere where the arriving ray bundle s minor angular diameter @xmath26 passes through zero .",
    "all such points lie on a caustic , and the locations on the camera sky where their ray bundles originate lie on critical curves .     around a black hole with spin parameter @xmath39 .",
    "as the camera moves , in the camera s reference frame a star at @xmath40 travels along the dashed - line path . ]    for a camera in the equatorial plane at radius @xmath29 , figure [ fig5:astroid603 ] shows the primary and secondary caustic curves .",
    "these are images , in the celestial sphere , of the primary and secondary critical curves shown in figure [ fig4:kerrlens ] .",
    "the primary caustic is a very small astroid ( a four - sided figure whose sides are fold caustics and meet in cusps ) .",
    "it spans just @xmath41 in both the @xmath42 and @xmath43 directions .",
    "the secondary caustic , by contrast , is a large astroid : it extends over @xmath44 in @xmath42 and @xmath45 in @xmath43 .",
    "all stars within @xmath46 of the equator encounter it as the camera , at @xmath47 , orbits the black hole .",
    "this is similar to the case of a source near the black hole and a camera on the celestial sphere ( far from the hole , e.g.  on earth ) @xcite . there",
    ", also , the primary caustic is small and the secondary large . in both cases",
    "the dragging of inertial frames stretches the secondary caustic out in the @xmath48 direction .",
    "because the spinning hole s caustics have finite cross sections on the celestial sphere , by contrast with the point caustics of a nonspinning black hole , stars , generically , can cross through them ; see , e.g. , the dashed stellar path in figure [ fig5:astroid603 ] . as is well known from the elementary theory of fold caustics (",
    "see , e.g. , section 7.5 of @xcite ) , at each crossing two stellar images , on opposite sides of the caustic s critical curve , merge and annihilate ; or two are created . and",
    "at the moment of creation or annihilation , the images are very bright .     of figure [ fig5:astroid603]a . in the right still , images 1 and 2 are about to annihilate as their star passes through caustic point @xmath49 . ]",
    "figure [ fig6:createannihilate ] ( two stills from a film clip at @xcite ) is an example of this . as the star in figure [ fig5:astroid603]a , at polar angle @xmath40 , travels around the celestial sphere relative to the camera , a subset of its stellar images travels around the red track of figure [ fig6:createannihilate ] , just below the black hole s shadow .",
    "( these are called the star s `` secondary images '' because the light rays that bring them to the camera have the same number of poloidal turning points , one  and equatorial crossings , one  as the light rays that map the secondary caustic onto the secondary critical curve ; similarly these images red track is called the star s `` secondary track '' . ) at the moment of the left still , the star has just barely crossed the secondary caustic at point @xmath50 of figure [ fig5:astroid603]a , and its two secondary stellar images , # 2 ( inside the secondary critical curve ) and # 3 ( outside it ) have just been created at the point half way between # 2 and # 3 , where their red secondary track crosses the secondary critical curve ( figure [ fig6:createannihilate]a ) . in the meantime",

    "however , near the fast - spinning hole s left shadow edge , the pattern is very different : three galactic - plane images between the primary and secondary critical curves , and eight between the secondary and tertiary critical curves .",
    "these multiple galactic - plane images are caused by the large sizes of the caustics  particularly their wrapping around the celestial sphere  and the resulting ease with which stars cross them , producing multiple stellar images .",

    "when it moves downward through the six sky - wrapped upper left branches of the tertiary caustic ( figure [ fig9:astroid]b ) , it creates twelve tertiary images , six on each side of the tertiary caustic . and because the upper left branches of all three caustics map onto the left sides of their corresponding critical curves , all the created images will wind up on the left sides of the critical curves and thence the left side of the black hole s shadow . and by symmetry , with the camera and the star both in the equatorial plane , all these images will wind up in the equatorial plane .",
    "so now we can count . in the equatorial plane to the left of the primary critical curve ,",

    "* when sampling images of accretion discs or extended structures such as interstellar dust clouds , we minimise moir artefacts by adapting the resampling filter according to the shape of the beam @xcite .",
    "another consequence is that each star contributes intensity to several pixels .",
    "the eye is sensitive to the sum of these and as a single star crosses this grid , this sum can vary depending on the phase of the geometric image of the star on the grid . ]",
    "this can cause distracting flickering of stars as they traverse the virtual camera s image plane .",
    "we mitigate this effect by modulating the star s intensity across the beam with a truncated gaussian filter and by setting the beam s initial radius to twice the pixel separation .    with this filter ,",
    "the sum is brightest when the geometric image of the star falls exactly on a pixel and dimmest when centred between four pixels .",
    "the shape and width of the filter are designed to give a maximum 2% difference between these extremes , which we found , empirically , was not noticeable in fast changing _ interstellar _ scenes .",
    "this result assumes the final size of the ellipse is small and the shape of the beam does not change significantly between adjacent pixels . in extreme cases",
    "these assumptions can break down , leading to a distortion in the shape of a star s image , flickering , and aliasing artefacts . in these cases",
    "we can trace multiple beams per pixel and resample ( see e.g. chapter 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , _ interstellar _ s black hole , gargantua , when visualized , has a moderate spin @xmath83 , which gives rise to few areas of extreme distortion , so we did not observe these problems in images created for the movie .      for moving images , we need to filter over time as well as space .",
    "a traditional film camera typically exposes the film for half the time between individual frames of film , so for a typical 24 fps ( frame per second ) film , the exposure time will be 1/48 s. ( this fraction is directly related to the camera s `` shutter angle '' : the shutters in film cameras are rotating discs with a slice cut out .",
    "the film is exposed when the slice is over the emulsion , and the film moves onto the next frame when covered .",
    "the most common shape is a semicircular disk which is a `` 180 degree shutter '' . )",
    "any movement of the object or camera during the exposure leads to motion blur . in our case , if the camera is orbiting a black hole , stellar images close to a critical curve appear to zip around in frantic arcs and would appear as streaks of light on a 1/48 s photograph .",
    "we aim to reproduce that effect when creating synthetic images for films .",
    "this motion blur in computer graphics is typically simulated with monte carlo methods , computing multiple rays per pixel over the shutter duration . in order to cleanly depict these streaks with monte carlo methods",
    ", we would need to compute the paths of many additional rays and the computational cost of calculating each ray is very high . instead ,",
    "in dngr we take an analytic approach to motion blur ( cf .",
    "figure [ figa1:motionblur ] ) by calculating how the motion of the camera influences the motion of the deflected beam :        the camera s instantaneous position influences the beam s momentary state , and likewise the camera s motion affects the time derivatives of the beam s state .",
    "we augment our ray and ray bundle equations ( [ eq : rays2 ] ) and ( [ eq : bundleevolution ] ) to track these derivatives throughout the beam s trajectory and end up with a description of an elliptical beam being swept through space during the exposure .",
    "the beam takes the form of a swept ellipse when it reaches the celestial sphere , and we integrate the contributions of all stars within this to create the motion - blurred image .. ] these additional calculations approximately double the computation time , but this is considerably faster than a naive monte carlo implementation of comparable quality .",
    "we can put our analytic method into a more formal setting , using the mathematical description of motion blurred rendering of sung _",
    "@xcite , as follows .",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath237 which represents the resulting intensity of a sample located at coordinates @xmath238 on the virtual image plane of the camera , corresponding to a ray direction @xmath239 , and subtending a solid angle , @xmath80 .",
    "the sum is over each object , @xmath240 , in the scene , @xmath241 is the time the shutter is open , and @xmath242 represents the radiance of the object directed back towards the camera along @xmath239 from object @xmath240 .",
    "the shutter and optics may filter the incident radiance ( specific intensity ) and this is accounted for by the term @xmath243 .",
    "the term @xmath244 is a geometric term that takes the value 1 if object @xmath240 is visible or 0 if occluded .",
    "considering just the distortion of the celestial sphere to start with , we start with a ray in the direction @xmath245 at time @xmath246 , in the middle of the exposure .",
    "we determine whether this ray gets swallowed up by the black hole or continues to the celestial sphere using equations ( [ eq : b1b2 ] ) and ( [ eq : qob ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath247 .",
    "we evolve the initial direction @xmath239 and solid angle @xmath80 subtended by the sample into a new direction at the celestial sphere , @xmath248 , and ellipse @xmath249 , using the method described in [ subsec : app - raytrace ] and [ subsec : app - raybundle ] .",
    "when the ray strikes the celestial sphere , we integrate over the area @xmath249 , weighting the integration with our truncated gaussian filter , corresponding to @xmath250 .",
    "( we assume there is no time - dependent aspect to this filter and ignore the @xmath8 term .",
    "we also assume the celestial sphere is static . )",
    "our motion blur method approximates @xmath251 with the following expression : @xmath252 where the partial derivative is evaluated at the centre of the beam @xmath245 and at @xmath246 .",
    "this represents a ray that can be swept over an arc in the celestial sphere by varying the value of @xmath8 .",
    "this is convolved with the beam shape @xmath249 and filter and occlusion terms to give : @xmath253    in this form , the consequences of our approximations become clearer : by evaluating @xmath188 only at the beam centre @xmath245 and shutter - centre @xmath246 , a sample that crosses the black hole s shadow during the exposure would be given a constant value of @xmath188 ( either 0 or 1 ) instead of the correct expression that transitions during the exposure . this would lead to a hard edge at the shadow if the camera performed a fast pan .",
    "luckily , in _",
    "interstellar _ , the design of the shots meant this rarely happened : the main source of motion blur was the movement of the spaceship around the black hole , and not local camera motion .    to handle any cases where this approximation might cause a problem , we also implemented a hybrid method where we launch a small number of monte carlo rays over the shutter duration and each ray sweeps a correspondingly shorter analytic path .",
    "we used a very similar technique for the accretion disk .",
    "dngr was written in c++ as a command - line application .",
    "it takes as input the camera s position , velocity , and field of view , as well as the black hole s location , mass and spin , plus details of any accretion disk , star maps and nebulae .",
    "each of the 23 million pixels in an imax image defines a beam that is evolved as described in [ subsec : app - raybundle ] .",
    "the beam s evolution is described by the set of coupled first and second order differential equations ( [ eq : rays2 ] ) and ( [ eq : bundleevolution ] ) that we put into fully first order form and then numerically integrate backwards in time using a custom implementation of the runge - kutta - fehlberg method ( see , e.g. , chapter 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "this method gives an estimate of the truncation error at every integration step so we can adapt the step size during integration : we take small steps when the beam is bending sharply relative to our coordinates , and large steps when it is bending least .",
    "we use empirically determined tolerances to control this behaviour . evolving the beam along with its central ray triples",
    "the time per integration step , on average , compared to evolving only the central ray .",
    "the beam either travels near the black hole and then heads off to the celestial sphere ; or it goes into the black hole and is never seen again ; or it strikes the accretion disk , in which case it gets attenuated by the disk s optical thickness to extinction or continues through and beyond the disk to pick up additional data from other light sources , but with attenuated amplitude .",
    "we use automatic differentiation @xcite to track the derivatives of the camera motion through the ray equations .",
    "each pixel can be calculated independently , so we run the calculations in parallel over multiple cpu cores and over multiple computers on our render - farm .",
    "we use the openvdb library @xcite to store and navigate volumetric data and autodesk s maya @xcite to design the motion of the camera .",
    "( the motion is chosen to fit the film s narrative . ) a custom plug - in running within maya creates the command line parameters for each frame .",
    "these commands are queued up on our render - farm for off - line processing .",
    "a typical imax image has 23 million pixels , and for _ interstellar _ we had to generate many thousand images , so dngr had to be very efficient .",
    "it has 40,000 lines of c++ code and runs across double negative s linux - based render - farm .",
    "depending on the degree of gravitational lensing in an image , it typically takes from 30 minutes to several hours running on 10 cpu cores to create a single imax image .",
    "the longest renders were those of the close - up accretion disk when we shoe - horned dngr into mantra .",
    "for _ interstellar _ , render times were never a serious enough issue to influence shot composition or action .",
    "our london render - farm comprises 1633 dell - m620 blade servers ; each blade has two 10-core e5 - 2680 intel xeon cpus with 156 gb ram . during production of _",
    "interstellar _ , several hundred of these were typically being used by our dngr code .",
    "our code dngr includes three different implementations of an accretion disk :    _ thin disk _ : for this , we adapted our dngr ray - bundle code so it detects intersections of the beam with the disk . at each intersection",
    ", we sample the artist s image in the manner described in section [ subsec : raybundle ] and [ subsec : app - filtering ] above , to determine the colour and intensity of the bundle s light and we attenuate the beam by the optical thickness ( cf .  [ subsec : app - implementation ] ) .",
    "_ volumetric disk _ : the volumetric accretion disk was built by an artist using sidefx houdini software and stored in a volumetric data structure containing roughly 17 million voxels ( a fairly typical number ) .",
    "each voxel describes the optical density and colour of the disk in that region .",
    "we used extinction - based sampling @xcite to build a mipmap volume representation of this data .",
    "the length of the ray bundle was split into short piecewise - linear segments which , in turn , were traced through the voxels .",
    "we used the length of the major axis of the beam s cross section to select the closest two levels in the mipmap volume ; and in each level we sampled the volume data at steps the length of a voxel , picking up contributions from the colour at each voxel and attenuating the beam by the optical thickness .",
    "the results from the two mipmap levels were interpolated before moving on to the next line segment .    _ close - up disk with procedural textures _ : side effects software s renderer , mantra , has a plug - in architecture that lets you modify its operation .",
    "we embedded the dngr ray - tracing code into a plug - in and used it to generate piecewise - linear ray segments which were evaluated through mantra .",
    "this let us take advantage of mantra s procedural textures and shading language to create a model of the accretion disk with much more detail than was possible with the limited resolution of a voxelised representation .",
    "however this method was much slower so was only used when absolutely necessary .",
    "_ disk layers close to the camera _ the accretion - disk images in _ interstellar _ were generated in layers that were blended together to form the final images .",
    "occasionally a layer only occupied space in the immediate vicinity of the camera , so close that the infuences of spacetime curvature and gravitational redshifts were negligible .",
    "these nearby layers were rendered as if they were in flat spacetime , to reduce computation time .",
    "_ frequency shifts .",
    "_ in our visualizations that included doppler and gravitational frequency shifts , we modelled the accretion disk as a constant - temperature blackbody emitter and we estimated the star temperatures from published nasa data @xcite .",
    "the doppler and gravitational frequency shifts correspond to a temperature shift in the blackbody spectra on arrival at the camera .",
    "we convolve those temperature - shifted black body spectra with the published spectral sensitivity curves of a typical motion picture film @xcite to generate separate red , green and blue radiance values , @xmath254 , @xmath4 and @xmath255 . for the volumetric disk ,",
    "these are calculated at each step and used in place of artist - created radiance values . in figure",
    "[ fig15:disk]b we removed the doppler - induced intensity change by dividing figure [ fig15:disk]d s rgb triplet of radiance values by a weighted mean that , empirically , leaves the eye - perceived colours unchanged : @xmath256 .",

    "we set the white balance of our virtual camera to render a 6500 k blackbody spectrum with equal red , green and blue pixel values by applying a simple gain to each colour channel .",
    "we did not model the complex , nonlinear interaction between the colour - sensitive layers that occurs in real film .      near the end of section [ subsec : previous ] , we compared our code dngr with the state - of - the - art astrophysical visualization code gray . the most important differences ",
    "dngr s use of light - beam mappings vs.  gray s use of individual - ray mappings , and dngr s use of ordinary processors vs.  gray s use of gpus  were motivated by our different goals : smoothness of images in movies vs.  fast throughput in astrophysics .",
    "so far as we are aware , our code is unique in using light - beam - based mappings .",
    "no other code , astrophysical or film cgi , uses them . however , some film cgi codes use flat - spacetime mappings from the camera s image plane to the source plane that are mathematically equivalent to our light beams .",
    "specifically , they use _ ray differential _ techniques described by igehy @xcite , which track , along a ray , the transverse derivatives of the locations of nearby rays , thereby producing the matrix @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is a ray s source - plane location as a function of its image - plane location . tracking these differentials in flat spacetime is moderately easy because they are constant along straight paths between reflections , refractions , etc ; and they change via simple matrix transformation laws at interaction locations . tracking them through curved spacetime would entail the same geodesic - deviation technique as underlies our ray - bundle mappings .",
    "in [ sec : pointstars ] we have described our methods of imaging star fields , using stars that are point sources of light : we feed each star s light into every light beam that intersects the star s location , with an appropriate weighting .",
    "other gravitational - lensing codes deal with star fields differently .",
    "for example , mller and frauendiener @xcite calculate where each point - star ends up in the camera s image plane , effectively producing the inverse of the traditional ray - tracing algorithm .",
    "they do this for lensing by a non - spinning black hole ( schwarzchild metric ) which has a high degree of symmetry , making this calculation tractable . doing so for a spinning black hole would be much more challenging .",
    "a common method for rendering a star - field is to create a 2d source picture ( environment map ) that records the stars positions as finite - sized dots in the source plane ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this source picture is then sampled using the evolved rays from the camera .",
    "this has the disadvantage that stars can get stretched in an unrealistic way in areas of extreme magnification , such as near the critical curves described in section [ subsec : kerrcaustics ] of this paper . as we discussed in [ sec : pointstars ] , our dngr light - beam technique with point stars circumvents this problem  as does the mller - frauendiener technique with point stars .",
