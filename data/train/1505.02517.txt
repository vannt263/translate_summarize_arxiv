    "in recent years the field of opto - mechanics has broadened from quantum - opto - mechanical research undertaken in high - q resonators  @xcite to include the interaction of light with vibrations in high index - contrast optical waveguides  @xcite . the dominant opto - mechanical effect to occur in waveguiding geometries",
    "is stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) , which is the scattering of light from the travelling grating that is formed by an acoustic wave in the optical medium  @xcite .",
    "sbs was first proposed by brillouin  @xcite and subsequently observed in various systems , ranging from first experiments with quartz  @xcite , over the field of fibre optics , where it is well - known as a strong third - order nonlinearity  @xcite to more recent studies in on - ship waveguide such as chalcogenide rib waveguides  @xcite . this evolution has led naturally to the most recent investigation of sbs in silicon nanowires  @xcite based on exciting theoretical work  @xcite in the past few years .",
    "the very strong acousto - optical interaction that can be achieved in this system provides the potential to implement a number of established sbs - applications in on - chip platforms ; this includes novel light sources  @xcite , non - reciprocal light propagation  @xcite , slow light  @xcite , and signal processing in the context of microwave photonics  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the description of sbs is based on the approximation that sbs is by far the dominating nonlinear effect .",
    "a consequence of this approximation is that the total amplification of the stokes wave along the waveguide s full length should be proportional to the power of the injected pump beam .",
    "the stokes wave should then initially exhibit exponential growth until it starts to deplete the pump ; additional stokes power can be gained by using a longer waveguide or by increasing the pump power . however , nonlinear loss is known to have relevant impact on the related effect of stimulated raman - scattering  @xcite ( especially in silicon photonics ) and recent experiments in silicon waveguides at telecom wavelengths have also strongly suggested that nonlinear loss has an appreciable impact on the overall dynamic of the sbs process  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "third - order loss  two - photon absorption ( 2pa )  can be expected to have a qualitatively different effect on the sbs gain compared to fifth - order processes such as three - photon absorption ( 3pa ) and 2pa - induced free carrier absorption ( fca ) .",
    "the latter is of considerable importance for semiconductor waveguides , which are the best candidates for affordable highly integrated optical circuits . evaluating the impact of nonlinear loss terms on the sbs gain is critical for the design of future sbs - based devices .    in this paper",
    "we study the impact of 2pa and 2pa - induced fca on the performance of sbs . to this end",
    ", we derive nonlinear loss coefficients and solve the sbs - equations analytically within a small - signal approximation .",
    "we thereby deviate from the raman literature  @xcite , which is necessary because sbs ( in contrast to raman scattering ) is not always a forward - process , which would lead to directly integrable differential equations .",
    "our analytical solutions provide strict upper bounds for key quantities such as output powers and amplification , which we express in terms of figures of merit for sbs in the presence of different types of nonlinear loss . for the case of negligible fifth - order losses ( i.e. where fca can be neglected ) , we find @xmath0 whereas the appropriate figure of merit for the case of dominant 2pa - induced fca with a weak 2pa - perturbation is @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the effective linear loss coefficient , effective 2pa - parameter , effective fifth - order loss ( 2pa - induced fca ) parameter and the sbs - gain , respectively .",
    "these figures of merit must be greater than @xmath6 in order for the stokes wave to be amplified .",
    "the application of these figures of merit can result in upper bounds for the stokes amplification ; an investigation of the specific limits resulting from the presence of free carriers has been submitted separately as a rapid communication  @xcite .",
    "the layout of the manuscript is as follows : in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , we state the preliminaries of our analysis , we introduce the relevant equations of motion , define and apply the small - signal approximation for the stokes wave and state the expressions for the effective nonlinear loss coefficients for the case of intra - mode forward and backward sbs . in section  [ sec : solutions ] , we solve the small - signal equations analytically for systems that exhibit 2pa and linear loss , for systems with 2pa - induced fca with and without linear loss and we discuss the leading order perturbative expression for case of linear loss and fca with additional weak 2pa . based on these analytical solutions",
    "we proceed in section  [ sec : design ] to derive figures of merit and present design guidelines for maximising sbs gain in arbitrary waveguide geometries .",
    "conclusions and implications are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "finally , we include three appendices , in which we state the nonlinear coefficients for the more general case of inter - mode sbs as well as their derivations .",
    "we consider the interaction between optical and acoustic fields in waveguides with a material cross section that is invariant along the @xmath7-axis and supports both optical and acoustic guided modes .",
    "for the materials we assume the absence of magnetic response ( @xmath8 ) , of material dispersion , of even - order nonlinearities ( in particular piezoelectricity ) and of the kerr effect . we explicitly include weak linear and odd - order nonlinear optical loss .",

    "however , it can be motivated as follows : first , the approximation leads to a distribution of the stokes power along the waveguide that is strictly proportional to the injected stokes power .",
    "this means that the sbs - active waveguide acts as a linear amplifier for the stokes signal and only in this situation can the waveguide be expressed by an amplification factor that does not explicitly depend on the stokes power .",
    "more importantly , this provides an upper bound for the amplification that is realisable for a certain set of parameters @xmath36 and @xmath5 , because every term we neglect in the small - signal approximation introduces further loss .",
    "in other words , the stokes amplification predicted within this approximation is a upper bound for the amplification that can be observed in reality with a finite stokes input power .",
    "stokes amplification can be observable in an experiment if and only if the small - signal approximation predicts it .",
    "the expressions derived thus far apply to both inter - mode and intra - mode sbs , both in forward and backward configuration determined by the sign of the modal normalisation power @xmath37 of the stokes wave ( positive for forward scattering , negative for backward scattering ) .",

    "although this effect can be reduced by extracting free carriers via an externally applied electric field , the loss due to 2pa - induced fca will still surpass the 2pa itself in many situations and the results from section  [ sec : ss_fca_lin_and_weak_tpa ] can be applied .",
    "in contrast to the previous section , the total stokes amplification of a waveguide that experiences fca is non - monotonic with power and is in fact bounded with respect to both the injected pump power and its length . for each set of sbs gain and loss parameters , there is exactly one choice of length and pump power that leads to the maximal gain , as can be seen in fig .",

    "unlike the situation without fca ( see section  [ sec : design_tpa ] ) , @xmath131 merit also implies an absolute maximum for the stokes amplification that can be obtained with a given waveguide design .",

    "in the case of fsbs , we employed a simple 4-th order runge - kutta integrator . in the case of bsbs",
    ", we used the shooting method based on a variable order runge - kutta that is optimised for stiff differential equations .",
    "it is clearly visible how the small - signal solution provides an upper bound for the realisable stokes amplification .",
    "the difference can be attributed to energy transfer from the pump to the stokes ( known as pump depletion in sbs without loss ) and additional carrier generation due to the relatively high stokes intensity .",
    "finally , we note that the optimal operating conditions ( waveguide length and pump power ) shift as the input stokes level is increased and that this affects forward sbs and backward sbs quite differently .",
    "this is because the small - signal approximation no longer applies over the full range of @xmath131 and input stokes powers . in the case of bsbs ,",
    "the amplification maximum as a function of waveguide length and pump power remains very flat , which means that the analytical prediction is very viable .",
    "however , in the case of fsbs the amplification maximum becomes fairly sharp and the waveguide has to be shortened to obtain performance that is comparable to the bsbs amplification shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : design_fca_comp ] .",
    "in other words : a forward sbs amplifier has a smaller dynamic range than an amplifier based on backward sbs .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the impact of nonlinear optical loss on the process of sbs within a small - signal approximation . based on analytical solutions to this problem , we have derived figures of merit that describe the suitability of a material or a waveguide design for the case that fifth - order nonlinear loss effects such as 2pa - induced fca can be neglected and the case that they can not . in the former case , we find that , although third - order loss reduces the total stokes wave amplification along the waveguide , the amplification is not fundamentally restricted and can be increased indefinitely by increasing pump power until the weakest component in the optical circuit is permanently damaged . in the latter case , however , the stokes amplification due to sbs is overcome by fca once some optimal pump power is exceeded .",
    "thus , the total amplification is bounded to a value that is ultimately given by the figure of merit @xmath135 .",
    "this opens basically three possible routes to effective sbs - circuits in semiconductor ( especially silicon ) photonics platforms .",
    "first , the upper amplification bound can be increased by reducing the linear loss @xmath2 .",
    "this often is a challenging task .",
    "second , the impact of fca could be drastically reduced by removing the free carriers by means of an externally applied electric field .",
    "the resulting increase in linear loss would be tolerable as long as the product @xmath136 is reduced .",
    "the third , and on a short time scale potentially most viable , solution would be to design future silicon photonic circuits for sbs to operate at wavelengths below the 2pa - threshold , around @xmath137 for the case of silicon .",
    "this would eliminate not only 2pa ( which itself is not problematic ) , but in particular the induced fca and lead to higher acoustic quality factors due to the reduced acoustic frequency .",
