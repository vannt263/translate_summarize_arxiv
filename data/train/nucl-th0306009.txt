    "the evaluation of the saturation properties of nuclear matter from realistic models of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is one of the challenging testing grounds for many - body theories of quantum systems@xcite .",
    "the strong short range and tensor components , which are required in realistic nn interactions to fit the nn scattering data lead to corresponding correlations in the nuclear wave function .",
    "the importance of these correlations is indicated by the observation that a simple hartree - fock or mean field calculation for nuclear matter at the empirical saturation density using such realistic nn interactions typically yields positive energies rather than the empirical value of -16 mev per nucleon@xcite .",
    "while this argument on the importance of correlation effects in the nuclear wave function is based on a theoretical calculation only , more empirical evidence on these short range correlations can be deduced from the analysis of nucleon knock - out reactions@xcite .",
    "a recent analysis of the @xmath0 reaction on @xmath1pb covering a wide range of missing energies indicates that the occupation numbers for the deeply bound proton states are depleted by the same amount of about 15 to 20 percent@xcite .",
    "this depletion of the deeply bound hole states can be identified with the corresponding depletion of hole states in nuclear matter with momenta well below the fermi momentum@xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic factors for these deep lying hole states should be determined by the tensor and short - range correlations mentioned above .",
    "long - range correlations , on the other hand , lead to an additional reduction of the spectroscopic factors for states close to the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "since these long - range correlations are sensitive to the collective excitation modes of the system , they should be different in finite nuclei as compared to the infinite system of nuclear matter .",
    "various tools have been employed to account for correlations in the nuclear many - body wave function .",
    "these include the traditional approach , the brueckner hole - line expansion@xcite , and variational approaches using correlated basis functions@xcite .",
    "attempts have also been made to employ the technique of a self - consistent evaluation of green s functions@xcite to the solution of the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "this method offers various advantages : ( i ) the single - particle green s function contains detailed information about the spectral function , i.e. the distribution of single - particle strength , to be observed in nucleon knock - out experiments , as a function of missing energy and momentum .",
    "( ii ) the method can be extended to finite temperatures , a feature which is of interest for the study of the nuclear properties in astrophysical environments .",
    "( iii ) the brueckner hartree fock ( bhf ) approximation , the approximation to the hole - line expansion which is commonly used , can be considered as a specific approximation within this scheme .",
    "attempts have been made to start from the bhf approximation and include the effects of the hole - hole scattering terms in a perturbative way@xcite . for a consistent treatment ,",
    "however , one should treat the propagation of particle - particle and hole - hole states in the in - medium scattering equation on the same footing .",
    "this turned out to be a rather ambitious aim .",

    "these pairing effects can be taken into account by means of the bcs approach@xcite . at the empirical saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter",
    "the solution of the gap equation in the @xmath4 partial wave leads to an energy gap of around 10 mev .",
    "another approach is to consider an evaluation of the generalized ladder diagrams with `` dressed '' single - particle propagators .",
    "this means that the single - particle green s functions are not approximated by one pole term but one tries to account for the complete spectral distribution .",
    "attempts have been made to represent the spectral distribution in terms of three discrete poles@xcite or in terms of four gaussians@xcite .",
    "indeed it turns out that such an improved representation of the single - particle green s function leads to stable solutions .",
    "this finding is supported by the investigations of boek and czerski@xcite employing separable interaction models .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same instabilities also occur in studies of finite nuclei@xcite , leading to divergent contributions to the binding energy from the generalized ring diagrams .",
    "these contributions remain finite if the single - particle propagators are dressed in a self - consistent way .    in the present paper",
    "we want to present a method in which the equations for the one - body and two - body green s functions for nucleons in nuclear matter are solved in a self - consistent way , keeping track of the complete spectral distribution in the single - particle green s function .",
    "it turns out that the consideration of finite temperature helps to stabilize the numerical representation of the spectral distribution .",

    "while this width is almost independent on the temperature for the low - lying states ( @xmath125 ) , it increases strongly with @xmath27 for the states close to the fermi surface with a momentum ( @xmath144 , see eq.([density ] ) ) .",
    "the density dependence of the spectral width is shown in table  [ table_width ] . the density of the system and the fermi momentum @xmath145 of a filled sphere corresponding to that density are also reported . while the on - shell width for @xmath125 increases with density , the width at @xmath144 decreases . as we have seen already in table  [ table_temp ]",
    ", the width for the low - lying states is mainly determined by the phase space of the occupied states , which does not depend on the temperature , but on the density . in contrary , at the fermi surface , the width is determined by the temperature deformation of the fermi surface . since this deformation is more drastic at lower densities , the width there is larger .    in fig .",
    "[ eda ] , the binding energy per particle @xmath132 ( solid line with squares ) and the chemical potential @xmath13 ( dashed line with squares ) are plotted versus the density of the system at @xmath118 . for a comparison we also present corresponding results of bhf calculations ( continuous choice for the single - particle spectrum ) for @xmath118 ( thick lines ) and for zero temperature ( thin lines ) .",
    "we find a repulsive effect in the full @xmath27  matrix calculation compared to the bhf calculation at the same temperature .",
    "this repulsive effect increases with density , therefore the saturation density obtained in the full @xmath27-matrix calculation is smaller than the one obtained in the bhf approach .",
    "the resulting density , @xmath146 , however , is still almost twice as large as the ` empirical value ' , @xmath147 .",
    "this repulsive effect relative to the bhf calculations is consistent with the observations of ref .",
    "@xcite , both with respect to the density dependence but also with respect to the size of the repulsion .",
    "the so - called hugenholtz - van hove theorem states that , at zero temperature , the chemical potential should be equal to the binding energy at the saturation point  @xcite .",
    "the theorem is clearly violated by about @xmath123 in the bhf approach , while it should be fulfilled in the self - consistent @xmath27 matrix approach .",
    "this was first shown to be the case by boek and czerski for a self - consistent @xmath27 matrix approach using separable potentials  @xcite .",
    "although a zero temperature treatment is not really feasible in our approach , we can conclude a reasonable thermodynamic consistency in our calculation from the fact that the intersection point of @xmath148 with the binding curve at @xmath118 is located slightly above the saturation density . while the binding energy will increase as @xmath27 approaches zero , the chemical potential will become less attractive for a given density , such that the intersection point moves closer to the expected region .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a method for a self - consistent evaluation of the one- and two - body greens function of nuclear matter in the ladder approximation .",
    "in contrast to previous works , no parameterizations of the single - particle spectral functions were used and and the full structure of a realistic nn interaction ( cdbonn ) was taken into account .",
    "this requires evaluation of the in - medium nn @xmath27  matrix , the self - energy and the spectral functions of the nucleons for a wide range of energies and momenta .",
    "the equations describing these quantities were solved in an iterative scheme , for a given temperature and chemical potential .",
    "self - consistency could be established after several iterations so that calculation of observables from these greens functions converged to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "this computational scheme works rather well for temperatures above @xmath27 = 5 mev .",
    "the spectral functions for lower temperatures exhibit sharp structures , which requires a large number of meshpoints for a reliable representation .",
    "this inhibits direct calculations at very low temperatures .",
    "therefore we introduce an extrapolation procedure , which is based on the smooth behavior of the nucleon self - energy , to deduce results also for lower temperatures .    for the range of densities and temperatures we considered ,",
    "no signals of a pairing instability have been observed in the full calculation .",
    "the distribution of strength in the self - consistent spectral function shields the system against this instability , which is observed in the quasi - particle approximation .",
    "this supports the findings of investigations using separable nn interactions or parameterizations of the spectral distribution@xcite .    comparing the total energies per nucleon calculated with the self - consistent @xmath27-matrix approach with the corresponding results obtained in bhf calculations we observe a repulsive effect of around 5 mev per nucleon .",
    "as this repulsion increases with density , the saturation density of the self - consistent greens function calculation is shifted to lower densities . the resulting saturation density , however , is still too large as compared to the empirical value .",
    "the consistent treatment of hole - hole and particle - particle scattering terms in the full @xmath27-matrix calculation leads to results , which are consistent from the thermodynamic point of view .",
    "therefore , the hugenholtz - van hove theorem , which is violated in the bhf approach , is respected in the self - consistent greens function approach ( see also @xcite ) .",
