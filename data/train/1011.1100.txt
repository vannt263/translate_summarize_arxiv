    "blazars are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) dominated by a relativistic jet pointing to the observer .",
    "the relativistic beaming enhances the continuum , and therefore the equivalent widths of spectral lines produced by photoionization of cold gas clouds around the nucleus may be modest , comparing with other agn classes . in bl lac objects ,",
    "line weakness is extreme ( equivalent width @xmath4   ) .    in order to relate dimensions and time scales in the jet comoving frame to what is directly observed ,",
    "one should go through lorentz transformations , which are characterized by the doppler factor defined as @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the lorentz factor and @xmath7 is the angle of sight .",
    "when the relevant dimensions are much smaller than the spatial angular resolution , which is the usual case for the inner jet , the properties of the jet can be effectively constrained by the study of the variability of the emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ blazars are generally observed in a large frequency range , which , in some cases , covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the radio band to the tev gamma rays ( e.g. fossati et al .",
    "1998 , donato et al .",
    "2001 , ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) . the basic model for explaining the spectrum of blazars is in terms of synchrotron radiation , plus an inverse - compton ( ic ) component , which may be due to scattering off the electrons of the synchrotron photons , or those coming from the accretion disk , broad - line region or infrared torus .",
    "in practice , spectra are well constrained if the source size can be obtained though variability studies .",
    "the ideal situation would be to obtain the time dependence of the spectral energy distribution in the entire band of observation , and this has been done for very few objects ( e.g. hartmann et al .",
    "2001 , ballo et al .",
    "2002 , acciari et al .",
    "2009 , fuhrmann et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the systematic study of blazar variability in the optical and infrared bands has greatly profited of the development of robotic telescopes , which ensure long observing campaigns , with relatively little intervention from the observer .",
    "the large observing time can yield information complementing that of multifrequency campaigns , which obviously can cover at most few days .    here",
    "we report on 2004@xmath02009 six filters photometry of the blazar pks 0537 - 441 , which is unprecedented for the observing time dedicated to the source .",
    "pks 0537 - 441 is a @xmath8 bright ( v@xmath313 ) blazar , which was studied from radio to gev @xmath9 rays .",
    "the main characteristics of the broad - band spectrum are the synchrotron peak in the ir , the ic hump with a maximum in the @xmath9 rays , the x - ray spectrum sampling the tail of the synchrotron and the rise of the ic , and the presence of emission lines in the optical spectrum .",
    "therefore , the object belongs to the low - frequency peaked subclass of blazars ( pian et al .",
    "2002 , 2007 ) .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the observational procedures , data reduction and analysis .",
    "the results are given distinguishing between long- and short - term variability ( sections 3 and 4 ) .",
    "in the discussion section in particular we focus on the relevance of short time scales of variability in constraining the beaming of the source .",
    "the rapid eye mount ( rem ) telescope is a 60 cm fully robotic instrument located at the eso cerro la silla observatory ( chile ) .",
    "the telescope has a ritchey - chretien configuration with a 60 cm f /2.2 primary and an overall f /8 focal ratio in a fast moving alt - azimuth mount providing two stable nasmyth focal stations . at one of the two foci , the telescope simultaneously feeds , by means of a dichroic , two cameras : remir for the near - infrared ( nir ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ross ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the optical .",
    "both the cameras have a field of view of @xmath10 and imaging capabilities with the usual nir ( @xmath11 , j , h , and k ) and johnson - cousins vri filters .",
    "the telescope was originally designed for follow - up of _ swift _ gamma - ray bursts , but for most of the time it is used for standard observational programs .",
    "more information about the rem project and capabilities can be found in zerbi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , chincarini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , covino et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "both remir and ross instruments were used in order to obtain nearly simultaneous data and to study the spectral behavior of pks0537 - 441 at different levels of flux .",
    "the rem telescope has systematically observed this source for 5 years between december 2004 and march 2009 .",
    "data analysis has been carried out following standard recipes .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were obtained via aperture photometry by means of an automatic pipeline which aligns and rotates frames to a common reference , derives and calibrates photometry comparing to standard stars in the field from the 2mass catalogue in the nir and from sequences reported by @xcite in the optical .",
    "results were controlled manually using the graphical astronomy and image analysis ( gaia)pdraper / gaia / gaia.html ] tool : we selected only frames with reliable photometry and absolute calibration based on the presence of the calibration stars , on their consistency , stable background , correct centering , etc .",
    "in particular , for all frames , we required that at least three out four calibration stars were detected .",
    "the reference stars , the same in the optical and in the nir , are stars nr . 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 as labeled in hamuy & maza ( 1989 ) corresponding to the 2mass stars @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the agreement between the automatic pipeline and the manual analysis is typically better than 10% in flux .    in the following ,",
    "fluxes are corrected with @xmath16 ( kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) and the extinction laws of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , while magnitudes are the observed ones .",
    "the quoted errors are at 1@xmath17 and they include photometric and calibration uncertainties .",

    "the light curves of 2004@xmath02009 ( figs . [ fig : opticalnir ] and [ fig : zoomonir ] ) correspond to rather irregular exposures and are interrupted by large gaps , partly due to the visibility conditions of the source . nonetheless , this is the largest collection of published data on pks 0537 - 441 in terms of overall exposure ( @xmath18 s ) and number of photometric points in all bands ( about 4000 points ) .    a visual inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig : opticalnir ] and [ fig : zoomonir ] indicates very structured light curves , with grossly similar shapes in all bands . a number of rapid brightenings and fadings , which may suggest flare like episodes , are apparent .",
    "typical durations are months and the amplitudes are of several magnitudes ( see also table  [ tab : maxmin ] ) .",
    "the event described by @xcite and @xcite is that of jan 2005 ( days 41@xmath071 in vri bands , see fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalnir ] ) . that of february@xmath0march 2008 ( days 1189@xmath01216 in vrijhk bands , see fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalnir ] ) is the one considered by @xcite .",
    "a double flare structure is present in the period 21/02/2006@xmath031/12/2006 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : zoomonir ] ) .",
    "probably the event of 1971 , reported by @xcite , 4 mag in v in 8 months , is analogous to those examined here .",
    "we compared the spectral shapes at three epochs where all six filters are available and the intensity states are significantly different .",
    "an interesting case is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : sed ] , where it is apparent that the sed can be satisfactorily described by power laws .",
    "it is noticeable that the higher and lower states , which are separated by two weeks , exhibit an intensity variation by a factor @xmath19 and the spectral index changed only slightly ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "therefore , in both the low and high state the emission appears dominated by the jet , and no evidence of a thermal component is apparent .",
    "some deviations from a power law may appear in the low - state 2004 december 21 ( fig .",
    "3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the thermal component mentioned by @xcite is probably a consequence of the extreme variability of the source .",
    "we now concentrate on the short time scale variability , and in particular on the event of 2006 october 30 ( mjd  54038 ) .",
    "this is rather rapid : comparable to what observed by villata et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the notorious highly variable bllac object s5  0716 + 714 , about 0.002 mag / min in v. a time scale @xmath21  min corresponds to a size in the source frame @xmath22  cm , having considered @xmath23 , typical of blazars ( e.g. ghisellini et al 2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "this can be compared with other constraints on the size of the source . indeed ,",
    "as shown in table 4 of @xcite , the mass estimates of pks 0537 - 441 range from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "they are based on the measurements of line widths and the continuum intensity , which enable one to deduce the velocity of the clouds emitting the broad lines and their distance .",
    "the mass then follows from the virial theorem .",
    "the problem is that the continuum is dominated by the jet and one should use relativistically corrected values .",
    "such a correction is introduced , but in a somewhat gross formulation , only by @xcite , who favors the lowest value of mass .",
    "the gravitational radius @xmath26 for masses in the @xmath27 is @xmath28 cm .",
    "taking a jet basis at 6 gravitational radii one has typical dimensions in the range @xmath29 cm .",
    "these results confirm that the blazar duty cycle is able of extremely rapid changes in flux both at @xmath9 rays and optical frequencies and can have strong impact in the evaluation of the cosmic high - energy background ( giommi et al .",
    "2006 , draper & ballantyne 2009 ) .",
    "variability on time scale of minutes in the optical band appears a rather accessible probe of the relativistic jet structure . in future observations of pks 0537 - 441 and similar sources",
    "one should take into account that rapid variability of the type reported here appears a rare event and therefore very long monitoring should be scheduled .",
    "an important improvement with respect to our photometry would be the actual simultaneity in all bands , which can be obtained by beam splitting , since one could probe the color of the short events .",
