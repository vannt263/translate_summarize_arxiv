    "the discoveries of massive neutron stars , with @xmath2 , @xcite represent a challenge for nuclear and hadron physics : the central densities of these stellar objects are in the range from three to seven times nuclear saturation density , depending on the model adopted for calculating the nucleonic equation of state , see @xcite . at such large densities ,",
    "new hadrons are likely to form , such as hyperons and delta isobars , which however strongly soften the equation of state leading to a maximum mass smaller than the measured masses .",
    "the softening of the equation of state allows however to obtain stellar configurations which can be very compact and thus compatible with the results of recent analyses of the thermal emission of quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries suggesting the existence of stars with radii smaller than @xmath1 km @xcite .",
    "although these analyses are still under debate , we investigate here what would they imply for the composition of matter at high densities .",
    "0.5 cm    presently , none of the proposed equations of state for dense matter allows to fulfill at the same time the astrophysical constraints , i.e. maximum mass of at least @xmath0 and radii @xmath3 km , and the hadronic physics constraints of the appearance , at large baryon chemical potentials , of new degrees of freedom of the baryon octet and decuplet . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we argue that a possible way out to this problem is that actually two families of compact stars exist : hadronic stars which can be very compact ( radii could be smaller than @xmath4 km ) and have maximum masses up to @xmath5 and quark stars which have larger radii and can reach masses up to @xmath6 , as resulting from pqcd calculations @xcite . for this scenario to be feasible ,",
    "the formation in the stellar matter of delta isobars is crucial and , as we will show in the following , the recent constraints on the symmetry energy of nuclear matter at saturation favor an early appearance of delta isobars .    0.5 cm",
    "we adopt a walecka - type relativistic mean field model for the hadronic equation of state introduced in ref.@xcite . in this model ,",
    "additional non - linear terms are added ( in the vector mesons sector ) to the original glendenning model @xcite which allow to better constrain the equation of state at saturation by use of new experimental information on symmetry energy @xmath7 , giant monopole resonances and finite nuclei properties . in particular",
    ", we use the recent parametrization proposed in @xcite , sfho , but including also delta isobars and hyperons .",
    "let us first discuss the results obtained for @xmath7 as a function of the baryon density @xmath8 . in fig .",
    "1 we show @xmath7 for the gm3 @xcite and the sfho models . notice the splitting of the two results as the density exceeds the saturation density , with the sfho result lying below the gm3 result .",
    "we remark that in the gm3 model no constraint is imposed in particular on the derivative with respect to density of the symmetry energy at saturation , the parameter @xmath9 @xcite and which turns out to be of about @xmath10mev . on the other hand , in the sfho model",
    ", the additional parameters introduced in the lagrangian , allow to fix @xmath9 to @xmath11 mev , a value compatible with the analyses of ref.@xcite , where a window of values of @xmath9 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 mev has been obtained by use of laboratory and astrophysical constraints .",
    "the term of the symmetry energy related to the interaction , as obtained in the sfho model , reads @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the baryon-@xmath17 meson coupling and the mass of the @xmath17 meson respectively and @xmath18 is a polynomial function of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 fields . in the gm3 model , @xmath21 and @xmath7 increases linearly with the density .",
    "a more complicated dependence on the density arises in the sfho model which however can be mapped into a gm3-like model by use of a density dependent coupling @xmath22 which decreases as a function of the density .",
    "this parameter is crucial for computing the thresholds of appearance of the different baryons : depending on its value , delta isobars could appear after or before the hyperons as the density increases . as discussed in @xcite , among the four isobars ,",
    "the @xmath23 is likely to appear first because it is `` electric charge favored '' ( the @xmath24 chemical potential does not get a contribution from the electric charge chemical potential and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are electric charge unfavored ) .",
    "however it is `` isospin unfavoured '' due to its isospin charge @xmath27 .",
    "the coupling with the @xmath17 meson thus affects more the threshold of the @xmath23 rather than the thresholds of the hyperons . in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite delta isobars appear after the hyperons and at densities which are too high to be reached in compact stars . of course",
    "the crucial inputs for calculating the thresholds are the baryon - meson couplings expressed as the ratios with the nucleon - meson couplings : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 runs over the hyperons and the delta isobars . for calculating the beta stable equation of state needed for compact stars ,",
    "the couplings of the hyperons are fixed as in @xcite while for the delta isobars we set : @xmath32 and @xmath33 is varied in the interval @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "2 we display the ratio between pressure and energy density ( which provides a measurement of the stiffness of the equation of state ) for the gm3 and sfho models with @xmath35 . for the sake of discussion also the case @xmath36 is included ( here the hyperons degrees of freedom are artificially switched off ) . notice that for @xmath37 , which is the standard choice @xcite , the delta isobars appear at a density slightly above @xmath38 @xmath39 in gm3 and slightly below @xmath40 @xmath39 in sfho . in turn",
    "this implies that in the gm3 model hyperons appear before the delta isobars , as found in @xcite , shifting their threshold to very large densities . on the other hand , in sfho",
    "it is the opposite , delta isobars appear first and they shift to large densities the hyperons . as explained before this different behavior is due to the coupling with the @xmath17 meson : while in the gm3 model this coupling is constant , in the sfho model , effectively , it decreases with the density thus favoring states , as the @xmath23 , with negative isospin charge .",
    "this is also clear when looking at the curves obtained for @xmath36 : in gm3 a strong reduction of the threshold density is obtained ( of about @xmath41 @xmath39 with respect to the case @xmath37 ) while in sfho it is reduced of only @xmath42 @xmath39 .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show the mass - radius relations of compact stars , including pure nucleonic stars ( black line ) , hadronic stars with only delta isobars ( green dashed line ) , hadronic stars with hyperons and delta isobars ( red lines ) and finally pure quark stars ( blue line , same as in @xcite ) . the stellar configuration at which the green dashed line and the black line separate has a central density corresponding to the threshold for the formation of delta isobars . similarly , for the formation of hyperons ( continuous red line and green dashed line ) which in the sfho model appear after the delta isobars .",
    "we also display the two solar mass limit and the recent interval of radii indicated by the analyses of refs .",
    "the two solar mass limit can be reached only by quark stars ( nucleonic stars also reach the limit but only if hyperons and delta degrees of freedom are artificially switched off when computing the equation of state ) . on the other hand , configurations with small radii and masses close to the canonical @xmath43 are obtained with the hadronic equation of state that includes both hyperons and delta isobars ( see also @xcite ) but only if the coupling of the delta with the @xmath19 meson is slightly larger than the coupling of the nucleon with the same meson , i.e. @xmath44 ( similar effects are obtained by reducing @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) . arguments in favor of values of @xmath33 larger than one can be found in @xcite . as we have proposed in @xcite , if small radii stars do really exist together with massive stars , the scenario of coexistence of two families of compact stars is strongly favored . in this scenario ,",
    "most of the stars are actually hadronic stars and only very massive stars are composed by pure quark matter . the mechanism which allows to populate the quark star branch and the observational consequences of such a conversion process",
    "have been discussed in several papers @xcite .",
    "notice that the early appearance of delta isobars is crucial for this scenario to be viable : they indeed delay the appearance of hyperons which , once formed , are responsible for the seeding of stable strange quark matter and for the subsequent conversion process .    0.5 cm",
    "the new constraints on the symmetry energy at saturation , in particular the @xmath9 parameter , seem to favor an early appearance of delta isobars in dense matter .",
    "these degrees of freedom , together with hyperons , must be included in every calculation aiming at understating the structure of compact stars .",
    "the necessary softening of the equation of state allow for the existence of very compact stars although not very massive .",
    "however , the tension between the existence of massive neutron stars ( with candidates with masses even larger then @xmath0 ) and the recent indications of existence of very compact stars could be relieved within a scenario of coexistence of two families of compact stars . in particular",
    "heavier stars are , in our proposal , quark stars .",
    "these stellar objects , a part from their masses and radii larger than the one of hadronic stars , should show anomalous cooling histories and spinning frequency distributions . moreover ,",
    "in basically all the processes of merger of neutron stars we expect that the remnant , before collapsing to a black hole , is a quark star .",
