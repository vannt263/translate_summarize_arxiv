    "this study is based on a sample of 3 million hadronic @xmath9 decays selected as described in  @xcite from the data accumulated between 1992 and 1995 at centre - of - mass energy of 91.2 gev .",
    "we required that the central detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter were fully operational .",
    "a signal event is defined as an @xmath10 event with an initial or final state photon with energy greater than 10  gev .",
    "the selected photon candidate is required to be well contained within the detector .",
    "in addition the candidate cluster is required to be well isolated from other clusters and tracks .",
    "the angle of the candidate cluster with respect to the axis of any jet , @xmath11 , has to to be larger than @xmath12 .",
    "isolated photon candidates are selected by using a likelihood ratio method with four input variables .",

    "+ the observed likelihood distributions in the data in bins of photon energy were fitted with a linear combination of the monte carlo distributions for signal and background events which pass the isolation cuts and likelihood preselection requirements .",
    "the overall normalization of the monte carlo distribution is fixed to the number of data events .",
    "the fit is a binned maximum likelihood with the fraction of background events as a free parameter . + alternatively the fraction of background from isolated neutral hadrons was estimated from the rates of isolated charged hadrons .",
