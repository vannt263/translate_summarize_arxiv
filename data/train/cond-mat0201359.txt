    "in this paper , we are trying to study the nature of zero temperature quantum phase transition from d - wave superconductor at @xmath3 to the underdoped regime at @xmath4 of the high temperature superconductors ( fig.1 ) .     the temperature ( t ) versus doping ( @xmath5 ) diagram of high @xmath6 cuprates .",
    "it is well known that inside the superconductor phase @xmath7 , there are low energy quasi - particle excitations near the four nodes of the fermi surface , the quantum phase fluctuation of the cooper pair condensates are suppressed , the positive and negative vortices are bound together .",
    "as the doping decreases from the right to @xmath8 , the phase fluctuation increases . at the underdoped regime @xmath4 ,",
    "the quantum phase fluctuations are so strong that they generate free @xmath9 vortices , destroy the long range phase coherence of the d - wave superconductor , therefore the superconducting ground state .",
    "however , the local short - range pairing still exists , the low energy quasi - particles at the four nodes remain .",
    "this quantum phase transition is driven by the condensation of @xmath9 vortices . starting from this physical picture , balents , fisher and",
    "nayak discussed quantum phase transitions from @xmath10-wave superconductor to underdoped regime and to the anti - ferromagnet regime with focus on the condensation of @xmath11 vortices in @xcite .",
    "earlier discussions on the stability of @xmath11 vortex starting from mott insulating phase were given in ref.@xcite . the present paper focus on the condensation of @xmath9 vortices .",
    "mathematically , we can describe the transition by starting from the @xmath12 wave bcs hamiltonian inside the superconducting state @xmath3 in the presence of external magnetic field",
    "@xmath13 @xcite : @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 is random chemical potential due to _ non - magnetic _ impurities which will be set to be zero in the following .",
    "based on the earlier work on @xmath10-wave superconductor by simon and lee @xcite and on @xmath17 model by ye and sachdev @xcite , the author derived the gauge - invariant form in ref.@xcite : @xmath18 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the phase of the order parameter @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the momenta relative to the origin .    because high @xmath6 cuprates are strongly type ii superconductors ( @xmath23 ) , we assume the gap amplitude to be a constant @xmath24 across the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the phase @xmath25 can be set to be zero inside the superconducting state @xmath3 because its fluctuation is suppressed .",
    "however in the underdoped regime @xmath4 , there are strong phase fluctuation which leads to the free @xmath9 vortices located at @xmath26 with parity @xmath27 , then the phase @xmath25 satisfies @xmath28 .",
    "a lot of work has been done on a closely related problem where quasi - particles are coupled to the vortices generated by external magnetic field inside the superconducting state @xcite . employing semi - classical approximation , volovik pointed out that the circulating supercurrents around vortices induce doppler energy shift to the quasi - particle spectrum , which leads to a finite density of states at the nodes @xcite .",
    "this effect ( volovik effect ) has been employed to attempt to explain the experimental observations @xcite of longitudinal thermal conductivity @xmath29 in @xcite .",
    "starting from bcs hamiltonian , wang and macdonald performed a first numerical calculation on quasi - particle spectrum in vortex lattice state @xcite . by phenomenological scaling arguments , simon and lee ( sl ) proposed the approximate scaling forms for longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivities for _ dirty _ @xmath12 wave superconductors in the mixed state @xcite .",
    "anderson @xcite employed the first single - valued singular gauge transformation to study quasi - particle dynamics in the mixed state .",
    "unfortunately , anderson made an incorrect mean field approximation which violates the `` time - reversal '' symmetry @xcite , therefore leads to the incorrect conclusion that there is landau level quantization of energy levels of the quasi - particle .",
    "franz and tesanovic employed a different single - valued singular gauge transformation and studied the quasi - particle spectrum numerically @xcite .",
    "they did not see the signature of landau level quantization in their numerical calculations .",
    "more detailed studies in various kinds of vortex lattice states were conducted in refs.@xcite .",
    "the quasi - particle spectrum around a single vortex , paying special attention to the strong anisotropy of fermi and gap velocities , was given in @xcite .",
    "in the vortex lattice state , the vector potential only provides a periodic potential instead of scattering quasi - particles , its effect on the energy spectrum and other physical quantities is not transparent . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the author studied the quasi - particle transport in the disordered vortex state where the random ab phase scattering may show its important effects .",
    "i observed that because infinite thin @xmath30 vortices do _ not _ break the t reversal symmetry @xcite , there is no landau level quantization , any correct mean field theory should respect this t symmetry ( the other way around need not be necessarily true , for example , in @xmath31 fractional quantum hall system@xcite , the mean field state is a fermi surface of composite fermion which respects t symmetry even the original electron system breaks the t symmetry due to the external magnetic field ) .",
    "i applied the anderson singular transformation eqn.[first ] to _ disordered _ vortex state and found that the long - range logarithmic interaction between vortices suppresses the fluctuation of superfluid velocity ( scalar potential ) , but does _ not _ affect the fluctuation of the internal gauge field .",
    "therefore the scalar field acquires a `` mass '' determined by the vortex density , but the gauge field remains `` massless '' .",
    "the quasi - particle scattering from the `` massless '' internal gauge field dominates over those from the well - known `` massive '' volovik effect and the non - magnetic scattering at sufficient high magnetic field .",
    "this dominant scattering mechanism is a purely quantum mechanical effects which was overlooked by all the previous semi - classical treatments @xcite .",
    "in fact . it is responsible for the behaviors of both @xmath29 and @xmath32 in high magnetic field observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "when the vortices are generated by quantum fluctuations themselves are moving around , new physics may arise .",
    "for example , moving @xmath9 vortices does break t reversal symmetry and leads to hall voltage drop , a moving @xmath9 vortex is different from a moving @xmath33 vortex .",
    "this in - equivalence renders ft gauge in ref.@xcite useless for moving vortices although it is equivalent to anderson s gauge for static vortices .",
    "anderson gauge has to be employed to study moving vortices .",
    "intuitively , from newton s third law , the vortices must also feel the counter - acting ab phase coming from the quasi - particles .",
    "therefore there is a mutual ab phase scattering between vortices and quasi - particles .",
    "the dynamic doppler shift term on the quasi - particles can also be equivalently viewed as an effective gauge field coupled to the phase fluctuation ( see eqn.[act ] ) . in this paper , we enlarge anderson singular gauge transformation to _ two _ mutual flux - attaching singular gauge transformations .",
    "we then apply them to study the physics of quasi - particles coupled to moving vortices near the zero temperature quantum critical point .",
    "in canonical quantization and in coulomb gauge , we perform the two singular transformations ( which are dual to each other ) to quasi - particles(which are spinons ) and moving vortices(which are holons ) respectively to satisfy all the possible commutation relations . just like",
    "a conventional singular gauge transformation leads to a conventional chern - simon ( cs ) term , the two mutual singular gauge transformations lead to a mutual cs term .",
    "this elegant mutual cs term describe the mutual ab phase scattering between vortices and quasi - particles .",
    "alternatively , in path - integral presentation , the effective action describes the quasi - particle moving in both vector and scalar potentials due to the phase fluctuations of quantum generated vortices . by a duality transformation presented in refs .",
    "@xcite to a vortex representation , the quantum fluctuation generated vortices couple to quasi - particles by a mutual cs term , the vortices are also interacting with each other by long range logarithmic interactions due to charge fluctuation described by a maxwell term . neglecting the charge fluctuation and its associated dynamic doppler shift term first , we find a fixed line characterized by the mutual statistical angle @xmath34 and calculate the universal spinon , vortex and mutual hall drag conductivities which continuously depend on @xmath34 .",
    "this transition can also be viewed as a simple example of confinement and deconfinement transition . in the disordered phase ,",
    "the quasi - particles are described by @xmath35 dimensional qed . in the superconducting side , they are essentially free .",
    "we stressed explicitly the lack of periodicity of @xmath36 mutual cs gauge theory . when the @xmath36 charge fluctuation is taken into account",
    ", we treat both @xmath36 gauge fluctuations on the same footing and find the @xmath36 charge fluctuation turns the fixed line into a fixed point separating the d - wave superconductor and some unknown charge ordered state .",
    "both the dynamic doppler shift term and the mutual statistical interaction become irrelevant short - ranged interactions on both sides of the qcp .",
    "the spinon and holons are confined into electrons and cooper pairs in the condensation of @xmath9 vortices , in contrast to the condensation of double strength @xmath11 vortices discussed in @xcite and reviewed in most general form in appendix b. there are _ no _ gapless gauge field fluctuations in the final theory , in contrast to @xmath36 and @xmath37 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the properties of the two stable phases : disorder and superconducting phases around the critical point .",
    "as stressed in ref.@xcite , in weakly type - ii limit @xmath38 , the superfluid velocity vanishes in the interior of the superconductor , the doppler shift effect is completely absent , the ab phase scattering effect becomes the sole scattering mechanism @xcite . in this case , the interaction between vortices become short - ranged .",
    "the discussions in @xcite on high @xmath39 cuprates are limited to @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "except @xmath42 is extremely close to @xmath43 , we can safely take @xmath44 limit .",
    "the interaction between vortices become long - ranged logarithmic interaction and played leading roles as demonstrated in @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the quantum or thermal fluctuation generated free vortex density scales as @xmath45 ( here @xmath46 is the correlation length rather than the coherence length @xmath47 ) .",
    "for high @xmath6 cuprates , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , then @xmath50 , so as long as @xmath51 , namely except we get extremely close to the phase boundary , we can safely set @xmath44",
    ". then we have to consider the long - range interaction between the vortices which is mediated by charge gauge field , its important role will be demonstrated explicitly in sec .",
    "all the present experimental situations lie in the regime @xmath52 .",
    "the paper is organized as the following . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the effective action with both the mutual c - s interaction and the charge fluctuation , first in the path integral language , and then in canonical quantization representation .",
    "we stress the importance of the dual singular gauge transformation on the moving vortices to keep the mutual statistics invariant and derive the important expression of _ real _ electron operator in terms of spinon and holon ( eqn.[tough ] ) . in sec .",
    "iii , neglecting the charge fluctuation , we concentrate on the effect of the mutual c - s interaction and calculate the critical exponents and universal conductivities for general statistical angle @xmath34 . implications for double layers quantum hall system are given .",
    "some technical details are relegated to appendix a. in appendix b , we study double strength @xmath11 vortices in the most general form by assuming moving @xmath11 vortices also scatter quasi - particles by a mutual c - s term with any _ integer _ statistical angle . in sec iv , we discuss the combined effect of mutual c - s interaction and charge fluctuation , we show how the long - range charge fluctuation change the physical picture in sec .",
    "iii dramatically .",
    "there are only electrons and cooper pairs in the spectrum ; the fixed line is replaced by a quantum critical point ( qcp ) separating d - wave superconductor and some still unknown charge -ordered state ; there are no spin - charge separation and no gapless gauge field fluctuations in the final theory , in contrast to @xmath36 or @xmath53 gauge theories investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also discuss the properties of the two phases around the qcp . in section",
    "v , we apply the formalism developed for quantum generated vortices to study thermally generated vortices and random static vortex array in an external magnetic field inside @xmath10-wave superconductor and recovered the results established previously in ref.@xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss the connection and differences of our present approach to the @xmath54 gauge theory and point out some open problems .",
