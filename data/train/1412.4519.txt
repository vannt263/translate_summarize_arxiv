    "quantum control is aimed at designing external pulses in order to achieve efficient transfers between the states of the quantum system under study @xcite .",
    "this task is crucial in atomic and molecular physics , and has many applications extending from photochemistry to quantum computation .",
    "quantum control has attracted attention among the physics and chemistry communities @xcite , but also in applied mathematics for the development of new theoretical methods . in this context ,",
    "optimal control theory ( oct ) can be viewed as the most accomplished way of designing control fields @xcite .",
    "several modifications of the standard optimal control algorithms have been brought forward to account for experimental constraints @xcite , such as the non linear interaction of the system with the field @xcite , the question of spectral constraints @xcite and the robustness with respect to one or several model parameters @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown how optimal control strategies can be extended to enforce the constraint of time - integrated zero - area on the control field @xcite .",
    "this constraint is a fundamental requirement in laser physics , as shown in different experimental and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "basically this effect can be related to the fact that the dc component of the control field is not a solution of maxwell s equation .",
    "we refer the reader to the first part of the paper for a complete discussion .",
    "note that this point is particularly crucial in the thz regime , or with laser pulses accommodating only few optical cycles @xcite .",
    "the corresponding laser sources are by now commonly used in quantum control @xcite . up to now",
    ", the majority of the theoretical papers on quantum control does not consider this zero - area requirement @xcite , which may lead to non - physical electromagnetic control fields and is problematic in view of experimental implementations .",
    "in addition , imposing such a constraint to the control scheme may force the optimization algorithm to reach more efficient external fields achieving better transfer .",
    "these arguments show the importance of the methods and of the results presented in this work , in particular to fill the existing gap between theory and experiment .",
    "our preliminary study on the subject @xcite is a methodology - oriented paper , focusing mainly on the technical aspects of the optimization algorithms ( local and optimal approaches ) as briefly illustrated on two typical molecular processes ( orientation and dissociation ) .",
    "the present paper thoroughly expands this initial work @xcite by providing an extended numerical investigation and a detailed physical analysis of the dynamics of two specific molecular systems .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "the physical origin of the time - integrated zero - area constraint is presented in sec.[sec2 ] .",
    "for completeness the principles of the optimization algorithms are also briefly outlined , full technical details being referred to ref.@xcite .",
    "section [ sec3 ] focuses on the control of molecular orientation , with the co molecule as an illustrative example .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the dissociation of heh@xmath0 involving the control of a given fragmentation channel .",
    "conclusions and prospective views are given in a final section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the zero - area constraint for laser pulses although well - known , is rarely given a thorough and clear argumentation . for completeness and pedagogical purposes ,",
    "this section is devoted to the presentation of such a proof .",
    "the body of the proof is made of two parts : the calculation of the time integrated electromagnetic field and the physical interpretation of the result .",
    "we refer to the spatio - temporal electric field amplitude @xmath1 and its fourier transform @xmath2 , where the corresponding fourier conjugate variables are time @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 , on the one hand , and space @xmath5 and momentum @xmath6 vectors , on the other hand .",
    "these quantities are related through : @xmath7 together with the usual relation between the frequency and the wave vector : @xmath8 using these notations , the time integrated field area is given by : @xmath9 which , upon the inversion of the integration order , leads to : @xmath10 the last summation on the right - hand - side is nothing but the dirac function : @xmath11 equation ( [ a.4 ] ) can then be simplified after integration over time and frequency as : @xmath12 it is clear from eq.([a.2 ] ) that a null frequency @xmath13 has as a consequence a null momentum ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath15 the physical interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ a.7 ] ) is as follows .",
    "the term @xmath16 actually represents a non - oscillating ( @xmath17 ) , non - propagating ( @xmath18 ) dc stark field . assuming a non - zero value for such a field requires , from the corresponding maxwell equation , the necessary existence of a spatial electronic charge distribution .",
    "in particular , finite charges placed at finite distances may create the dc stark field in consideration .",
    "one may also invoke a charge distribution set at infinite distance , as limiting asymptotic conditions .",
    "but , of course , within this hypothesis , a non - zero stark field would necessitate an overall distributed infinite electric charge .",
    "ultimately , in systems where electric charges are not introduced on purpose , a dc stark field can not be created , and @xmath19      the goal of this section is to show how zero - area control fields can be designed .",
    "the three proposed methods are based on the optimization of the parameters of a functional form associated with the control problem .",
    "we consider a quantum system interacting with an electromagnetic field whose dynamics is described by the following time - dependent schrdinger equation : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the field - free hamiltonian and the interaction term , respectively , and @xmath23 the control field .",
    "the units used throughout this paper are atomic units .",
    "let @xmath24 be the initial state and @xmath25 the total duration of the control .",
    "the goal of the control problem is to maximize the expectation value @xmath26 of a given observable @xmath27 at time @xmath28 .",
    "the first approach consists in introducing a closed - form expression for the control field depending on a finite number of parameters denoted @xmath29 : @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the ensemble @xmath32 is chosen such that the constraint on the time - integrated area , @xmath33 , is satisfied .",
    "the optimal values of the parameters @xmath29 are determined in a second step by using gradient @xcite or global optimization procedures such as genetic algorithms @xcite .",
    "this approach , which can be very efficient in some cases , is however highly dependent on the parametrization used to describe the control field .",
    "a more general method is based on an extension of the optimal and local optimization algorithms , which enforces the zero - area constraint through the introduction of a lagrange multiplier .",
    "such algorithms are proposed and investigated in ref .",
    "for the sake of completeness of the paper , we briefly outline below the principles of the different optimization procedures and we refer the interested reader to our preceding work for technical details on the numerical algorithms @xcite .    the optimal control problem is defined through a cost functional @xmath34 : @xmath35 ^ 2.\\ ] ] which allows us to maximize the expectation value @xmath26 at time @xmath28 of a given observable @xmath27 , while penalizing the total energy of the control field and enforcing the zero - area constraint .",
    "the novelty of the computational scheme resides in the introduction of a new lagrangian multiplier @xmath36 to account for the zero - area constraint . in eq .",
    "( [ cost ] ) , the positive parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , expressed in a.u . ,",
    "weight the different parts of @xmath38 with respect to the expectation value of @xmath27 , and penalize the area of the field ( @xmath36- term ) and its energy ( @xmath37- term ) .",
    "larger is @xmath36 and closer is the time - area of the control field to zero . in eq .",
    "( [ cost ] ) , @xmath39 is a reference pulse and @xmath40 an envelope shape , which can be chosen as @xmath41 . as usual , note that the function @xmath40 is introduced in the cost functional in order to ensure the smooth switch on and off of the field at the beginning and at end of the control . starting from this new cost functional , it is straightforward to derive a standard iterative algorithm based on krotov ( as used in this work ) @xcite or gradient procedure @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient of the optimization procedure is the definition , at each step , of a new control field . at step @xmath42 ,",
    "we get : @xmath43}{2\\lambda}-\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda}s(t)a_k , \\label{eq : newfield}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the state of the system at the @xmath42th iteration , @xmath45 the adjoint state obtained from backward propagation of the target @xmath46 taken as an initial state for eq .",

    "( [ eq : newfield ] ) is different from a standard procedure .",
    "the local control theory ( lct ) @xcite can also be extended along the same lines by considering the following lyapunov function which accounts for the zero - area constraint : @xmath51 where @xmath27 is any operator such that @xmath52 .",

    "we will also use in the following the parameter @xmath57 .",
    "finally , note that the two proposed optimization procedures can only reduce the time - integrated area without completely removing it .",
    "a filtering process can further be used to accurately design a zero - area field .",

    "we also recall that , due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem , the projection @xmath70 of the total angular momentum on the field polarization axis is a good quantum number , so that @xmath71 does not depend on the angle @xmath66 . when the laser is switched on at @xmath72 , the initial condition is given by @xmath73 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath74 is usually taken as a quantitative measure of orientation .    in the non - zero temperature case ,",
    "the time evolution of the molecular system is described by the density operator @xmath75 solution of the von neumann equation : @xmath76.\\ ] ] the initial condition is a boltzmann distribution at temperature @xmath77 and the degree of orientation is given by the expectation value expressed in terms of @xmath75 : @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "numerical values of the molecular parameters are taken as @xmath79 @xmath80 and @xmath81 a.u .",
    "the rotational period , @xmath82 , is of the order of 8.64 ps or @xmath83 a.u . in the numerical computations ,",
    "the maximum number of @xmath84- levels populated is of the order of 12 .",
    "we first consider a class of pulses characterized by a closed - from expression in order to maximize the molecular orientation of the co molecule at zero temperature .",

    "as could be expected , the optimized fields show similar features . in this example , the area of the optimized field with the zero - area constraint is two orders of magnitude smaller than the one obtained without the zero - area constraint .",
    "this is a remarkable result since the time - integrated area is largely reduced while preserving a satisfactory orientation of the order of 0.2 .",
    "the price to pay for increasing the final degree of orientation can be seen in the fourier transform of the optimized pulses , which have a much more complicated structure with an oscillatory behavior at low frequency .",
    "these additional low frequencies found by the algorithm correspond to the slow oscillations of the optimized fields which appear after @xmath114 . by filtering out such oscillations , we have checked that this oscillatory behavior is essential to produce a high degree of orientation .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe that the low frequency distribution of the optimized field coincides with the rotational resonance frequencies .",
    "this suggests an interpretation for the origin of the oscillatory behavior and a possible control mechanism based on the excitation of these different frequencies .",
    "another important application of local and optimal control strategies is illustrated on molecular photodissociation .",

    "the oct field first uses a low frequency component centered at about 0.8 a.u .",
