    "spiral structures of galaxies have been studied for a long time in order to understand how these structures are formed ( e.g. , roberts , roberts & shu 1975 ; rohlfs 1977 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "one of the proposed models to explain spiral arms is that they are just material arms , where the stars originally making up a spiral arm remains in the arm even at the later time .",
    "however this simple model holds a wellknown problem which is called `` winding problem '' : the differential rotation in galactic disks winds up the arm in a short time compared with the age of galaxies , so that the spiral pattern would be too tightly wound compared with the observed spiral structures . in contrast , the currently most popular model , which is free from the winding problem , is the density wave theory ( lin & shu 1964 ) , where a spiral arm is regarded as a wave and wavelike oscillation of stellar motions propagates through galactic disks . in this picture , the global spiral pattern is sustained independently of individual stars moving at different angular velocities . for a comprehensive review of the density wave theory ,",
    "see , e.g. , rohlfs ( 1977 ) and binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) .",
    "the density wave theory has been suggested by various observational aspects in spiral galaxies , including the relative distributions of dust lane , interstellar gas , and h ii regions across the arms ( fujimoto 1968 ; roberts 1969 ; rohlfs 1977 ) , intensity distribution of radio continuum radiation ( mathewson , van der kruit , & brouw 1972 ) , and systematic variation of gaseous velocity fields near the arms ( e.g. , visser 1980 ) . in particular , recent high - resolution observations using co emission have revealed detailed streaming motions of molecular gas , which are generally in agreement with predictions of the density wave models ( e.g. , kuno & nakai 1997 ; aalto et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , we note that these observational results provide only an outcome of nonlinear interaction between interstellar matter and background stellar arms , and it is yet unknown whether the motions of stars _ themselves _ , which make up spiral pattern , actually follow those predicted by the density wave theory . in this regard ,",
    "the direct access to detailed stellar kinematics in disks is possible only in our galaxy .    here",
    ", we present a method to clarify this issue , based on the analysis of local kinematics of disk stars .",
    "we then apply the method to 78 cepheids in the solar neighborhood , for which the precise data of proper motions are available from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "also , the distances to these sample stars can be accurately estimated from the period - luminosity relation , so that combined with the radial velocity data , the full three - dimensional velocities are available .",
    "we note here that although we focus on the local kinematics of spiral arms in this work , the method we develop here can be applied to the motions of more remote stars distributed over a whole disk , for which precise astrometric data will be provided by the next - generation satellites such as _ fame _ and _ gaia_.    our paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the method to determine whether or not the motions of stars agree with those expected in the density wave theory . in  3 , we show the detail of the sample stars and the fundamental parameters of our galaxy adopted in this work .",
    "the application of our method to the sample stars is shown in  4 . finally ,  5",
    "is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "all orbits of the disk stars in our galaxy are not perfectly circular .",
    "the discrepancy between the motion of a star and its reference circular orbit , called orbit of the guiding center , can be represented by an epicyclic motion of the star ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "we describe here a method to compare the epicyclic motions of the stars observed near the sun with those expected in the density wave theory .",
    "first , we define the `` position phase '' , @xmath0 , as a function of the position of a star in the galactic plane , by assuming that the shape of the spiral arm is logarithmic as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the distance between the star and the galactic center ( gc ) , @xmath3 is the distance between the sun and gc , @xmath4 is the pitch angle of the spiral arm , @xmath5 is the angle between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is the angular velocity of the spiral pattern in the azimuthal direction .",
    "we note that all the stars on the same arm have the same value of @xmath0 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "second , we define the phase of the epicyclic motion of a star , @xmath7 , which is the angle between the velocity vector of the epicyclic motion and the direction perpendicular to a spiral arm ( figure 1 )",
    ". then , if the stellar motions in the arm obey the density wave theory , all the stars on the same arm have the same value of @xmath7 as well as the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "also , when the number of arms is @xmath8 , the epicyclic frequency @xmath9 of the stellar motions is equal to @xmath8 times as large as the angular frequency @xmath10 [ @xmath11 .",
    "if so , since @xmath12 , and @xmath13 from equation ( [ 1 ] ) , we obtain the following linear relation between @xmath7 and @xmath0 , @xmath14 if the stellar motions obey the density wave theory .",
    "thus , by assessing this linear relation between observed @xmath7 and @xmath0 , it is possible to investigate whether or not the observed stellar motions follow those predicted by the density way theory .",
    "we can also derive the number of the arms , @xmath8 , from the slope in the @xmath15 relation . in figure 3",
    ", we show the case @xmath16 ( solid lines ) as an example .",
    "we adopt the galactic cepheids as the tracers of stellar motions in spiral arms , because these bright stars can be seen from a long distance and so we can investigate a wide region around the sun .",
    "also , these young populations show only a small deviation from circular rotation , thereby allowing us to analyze the internal kinematics of spiral arms alone ; relatively old stars , such as dwarf stars , have too large velocity dispersions , possibly due to repeated gravitational interactions with massive clouds ( spitzer & schwarzschild 1953 ) in addition to the effect of spiral arms .",
    "furthermore we can obtain accurate distances for cepheids , based on the relation between pulsation period and absolute magnitude .",
    "we do not use the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes , which have generally large errors for many cepheids beyond @xmath17 pc from the sun .",
    "we adopt the cepheid catalog compiled by mishurov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for distances and radial velocities , and the _ hipparcos _ catalogue for proper motions , to calculate the individual motions of the cepheids in the galactic plane .    in the mishurov et al .",
    "catalog , cepheids in the region of @xmath18 kpc and those in a binary system are excluded .",
    "also , nearby cepheids in the region of @xmath19 kpc are excluded in order to reduce the local effects like gould s belt .",
    "furthermore , cepheids whose pulsation periods exceed 9 days are also excluded , because they are supposed to be extremely young objects .",
    "in addition , we further exclude the cepheids within 1 kpc for the following reason .",
    "when we compare the observed distribution of cepheids in the @xmath15 plane with the theoretical prediction in a quantitative manner , as will be described later , we assign larger statistical weights to the cepheids having a smaller observational error [ eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) ] .",
    "this leads to larger weights to the cepheids located close to the sun , say @xmath20 kpc , so that the result of the analysis will be largely determined by only small number of cepheids in a small region near the sun .",
    "we also exclude two cepheids whose peculiar velocity is exceptionally large , over 50 km s@xmath21 , compared to other ones . as a consequence ,",
    "we adopt 78 cepheids in this work , and their spatial distribution is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we adopt @xmath22 kpc in our analysis , which is approximately an average of observed values ranging from 8.1 kpc to 8.5 kpc ( kerr & lynden - bell 1986 ; hanson 1987 ; pont , mayor & burk 1994 ; feast & whitelock 1997 ) . as for the pitch angle of spiral arms , @xmath4 ,",
    "in our galaxy , several authors investigated one of the conspicuous spiral arms near the sun , the sagittarius arm , based on the spatial distributions of open clusters , co emissions , or o - b2 clusters , and arrived at several to about @xmath23 ( pavlovskaya & suchkov 1984 ; dame et al .",
    "1986 ; grabelsky et al .",
    "1988 ; alfaro , cabrera - cano & delgado 1992 ) . in this work ,",
    "we adopt @xmath24 in the solar neighborhood , where the negative value for @xmath4 denotes a trailing arm .",
    "we have found that even if we change the values of these parameters over a likely range , the result shown below remains essentially unchanged .    in order to analyze the epicyclic motion of the cepheids ,",
    "we require to subtract both the local solar motion with respect to the local standard of rest and the effect of the galactic differential rotation from the observed motions . as the local solar motion",
    ", we adopt 15.5 km s@xmath21 in the direction to @xmath25=45@xmath26 and @xmath27 ( kulikovskij 1985 ) .",
    "to estimate the effect of the galactic differential rotation , we assume that in the concerned region within about @xmath28 kpc from the sun , the galactic rotation is monotonously changing with distance from the sun , where the oort constant @xmath29 is assumed to be @xmath30 km s@xmath21kpc@xmath21 .",
    "we again note that the result shown in  4 is essentially independent of the value of @xmath29 or the assumption for differential rotation .",
    "we present the relation between the phases of the epicyclic motions of the cepheids @xmath7 and their position phases @xmath0 in figure 3 .",
    "we also show the case for the 4-armed galaxy which obeys the density wave theory ( solid lines ) .",
    "if the motions of the cepheids in the solar neighborhood are in accordance with those expected in the density wave theory , we expect the similar linear relation between @xmath7 and @xmath0 . however , such a linear relation is not apparent for the cepheids , which may imply that these objects in the region we investigate do not obey the density wave theory .    to be more quantitative ,",
    "we analyze the motions of the cepheids by using the sum of squares of the deviations for the observed @xmath7 s from the theoretically expected ones .",
    "we define this deviation , @xmath31 , as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is defined as , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the error in the phase @xmath36 of the star @xmath4 , and @xmath37 is the phase when the motion of the star @xmath4 obeys the density wave theory . here",
    "we note that the error @xmath35 includes both the observational error and the velocity dispersion of the cepheids .",
    "we adopt 13 km s@xmath21 for the velocity dispersion . the quantity @xmath33 denotes the discrepancy between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for which we take the smaller value of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , because @xmath36 has a period of @xmath40 .",
    "the phase @xmath37 is determined by minimizing the deviation @xmath31 for each value of the arm number @xmath8 .    if the motions of stars are in accordance with those expected in the density wave theory , the expected value of the deviation @xmath31 is about the same as the number of the sample stars ( 78 in this work ) , because the distribution of @xmath41 is normalized by its standard dispersion @xmath42 .",
    "thus , in this case , we will obtain a minimum of @xmath31 with @xmath43 at a specific arm number @xmath44 , whereas at other @xmath8 s , the value of @xmath31 will be systematically larger than 80 ; the larger ratio of @xmath45 implies more likely the observed stellar motions match the density wave theory . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath31 is always larger than 80 at all @xmath8 s , we may conclude that the stellar motions are totally inconsistent with those expected in the theory .",
    "we plot the deviation @xmath31 as a function of @xmath8 in figure 4 .",
    "solid line shows the result for our cepheid sample .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath31 is around @xmath46 for all values of the parameter @xmath8 , without showing a noticeable minimum with @xmath47 .    in order to examine the significance of this result ,",
    "we investigate three hypothetical models for comparison . as the first model , we randomly select @xmath7 , independently of @xmath0 , so that there is no correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "we then assign the same errors @xmath35 as those for the cepheids to each @xmath7 .",
    "thick dashed line in figure 4 shows @xmath31 vs. @xmath8 derived from this `` random model '' .",
    "it follows that the properties of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath8 are basically the same as for the cepheids , thereby implying that the phase @xmath7 of the cepheids is random in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the second model , as shown by thin dashed line , follows the density wave theory with @xmath16 .",
    "we assign the same errors @xmath35 as those for the cepheids .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is around @xmath46 , except for the case of @xmath16 at the minimum of @xmath31 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this behavior of @xmath31 is in sharp contrast to the case of the cepheids .",
    "the last model ( dotted line ) is similar to the second one , except for the assignment of larger errors @xmath35 : 1.4 times as much as those of the cepheids , in order to see the effect of @xmath35 on the result . in this case , the value @xmath31 is smaller than other cases : @xmath49 except for the case of @xmath16 at the minimum of @xmath31 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "thus , even if the errors @xmath35 are large , which gives rise to small @xmath50 , @xmath31 has a noticeable minimum at a specific value of @xmath8 , in sharp contrast to the case of the cepheids .    therefore , these results suggest us that the motions of the cepheids in the solar neighborhood are inconsistent with those expected in the density wave theory , whereas the random model , in which the phases @xmath7 and @xmath0 are randomly selected , reproduces the observation in a reasonable manner .",
    "we have presented a method , based on the analysis of local kinematics of disk stars , to clarify whether the motions of the stars , which make up the spiral arms , follow those expected in the density wave theory .",
    "the method utilizes the comparison with the expected linear relation between the `` position phases '' of the stars @xmath0 and those of their epicyclic motions @xmath7 , as given in equation ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the application of the method to the 78 galactic cepheids within 4 kpc from the sun , for which accurate proper motions are available from _ hipparcos _ , has revealed that the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 for the cepheids does not show the expected linear relation .",
    "based on the quantitative analysis using the deviation @xmath31 , we conclude that the observed motions of the cepheids are well reproduced by the random model having no correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "there are a couple of possibilities to explain the current results , even if the spiral arms follow the density wave theory .",
    "first , the spiral structure around the sun may not be simple as given in equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , many of our sample cepheids belong to the local spiral structure called the orion arm , for which the definite conclusion on its spatial structure is yet to be reached .",
    "it is frequently expressed as `` orion spur '' , having a rather irregular pattern compared to other large - scale arms , sagittarius and perseus arm ( see , e.g. , gilmore , king , & van der kruit 1989 ) .",
    "the existence of the orion arm may give disturbances on the density wave motions of stars induced by these large - scale arms .",
    "second , the cepheids we have adopted here may still convey systematic velocities of dens gas clouds from which these stars were formed , in the form of the streaming motions .",
    "if there still exist some individual streaming motions among the sample stars , such motions may violate the ideal linear relation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 expected for the density wave motions .",
    "third , the cepheids we have adopted here may have already experienced some scattering by dens gas clouds , thus having large velocity dispersions ( spitzer & schwarzschild 1953 ) .",
    "however , our experiment in  4 ( dotted line in figure 4 ) implies that the effect of velocity dispersions of our sample on the result appears to be minor .    in order to settle the last issue described above",
    "more clearly , we have repeated our analysis using younger populations with smaller velocity dispersions than the cepheids . as such young stars",
    ", we have adopted the o - b5 stars , although due to their fainter luminosities than cepheids , the sample with available proper motions is confined to the narrower region near the sun .",
    "these sample stars are taken from the nasa sky2000 master star catalog ver .  2 ( sande et al . 1998 ) which provides almost 300,000 stars brighter than 8 mag .",
    "the catalog contains many basic quantities , such as mk classification , luminosity class , apparent magnitude , color , radial velocity , and so on .",
    "we have then calibrated distances using _ hipparcos _ parallaxes or spectroscopic distances using the program kindly supplied by drs . m.  sma and m.  yoshizawa , and also obtained accurate proper motions by the cross - identification with the _ hipparcos _ and act reference catalogs ( urban , corbin , & wycoff 1998 ) . after removing binaries and multiples , we have selected 773 o - b5 stars for which full three - dimensional velocities are available . then , the application of the method we have developed here has revealed that the deviation @xmath31 as a function of @xmath8 remains essentially constant of the order of 3000 , without showing any noticeable minimum at a specific value of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , even the motions of such young populations with small velocity dispersions are in contradiction with the density wave theory .",
    "we note here that most of these o - b5 stars are located within @xmath51 kpc from the sun , so the effect of the local irregular spiral on the result can not be negligible .",
    "more definite conclusions on the issue we have addressed here require the assembly and analysis of much larger numbers of stars with accurate distances and proper motions , so that the statistical fluctuation in the result can be significantly reduced . also , it is necessary to assemble the data of more remote stars over a large fraction of the disk , thereby diminishing effects of local irregular spiral structures on the kinematic analysis .",
    "indeed , next - generation satellites such as _ fame _ and _ gaia _ will provide very precise astrometric data for huge numbers of the galactic stars , and will thus offer us an opportunity to assess detailed motions of disk stars in conjunction with the density wave theory .",
    "we are grateful to m. sma and m. yoshizawa for providing us the program for calculating spectroscopic distances .",
    "t.y . would like to thank k. okoshi and s. bouquillon for useful discussion .",
