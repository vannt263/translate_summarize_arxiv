    "su(3 ) flavor symmetry , fs , is a feature of qcd in the limit of vanishing quark masses .",
    "it implies many spectacular relations in baryon spectroscopy .",
    "for instance , it relates @xmath6 to @xmath7 and @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "it also relates the width of flavor - symmetric states , such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "fs implies that , for every three - quark @xmath12 resonance , there exists its flavor - symmetric @xmath13 state , which should have the same spin and parity as the @xmath12 and have the flavor structure of su(3 ) octet members .",
    "the mass of the @xmath13 resonance should be larger than that of the @xmath12 by the constituent @xmath14 quark - mass difference , which is about 140  mev .",
    "furthermore , there could exist also a @xmath13 that is a su(3 ) flavor singlet .",
    "however , the @xmath13 singlet does not exist because it is not allowed as a consequence of color symmetry .",
    "fs also predicts that a triplet of @xmath15 states should exist for every @xmath12 octet and @xmath16 decuplet .",
    "the review of particle properties  @xcite lists several candidates for @xmath15 states in the energy range between 1.5 and 1.7  gev , the parameters of which are not well - established , and their status is still controversial .",
    "three of these states , the one - star @xmath17 and the two - star @xmath18 with unknown @xmath19 and the one - star @xmath20 , can not fulfill the requirements of fs and are therefore candidates for being either exotic states , such as five - quark states , or a hybrid state with an important gluon component in the wave function .",
    "this situation is a consequence of the lack of reliable data on @xmath3 interactions  @xcite , especially for the reactions that have several neutral particles in the final state .",
    "the experimental study of the reactions @xmath21 was performed with the crystal ball ( cb ) multiphoton spectrometer at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) , aiming at a substantial improvement of the hyperon - spectroscopy field .",
    "the major interest was in the production of the @xmath22 , @xmath0 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 final states . in these reactions ,",
    "the experimental situation was especially poor for the @xmath27 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 production .",
    "these final states have more than one neutral particle and could not be measured in the old bubble - chamber experiments .",
    "our results on the @xmath22 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 production in @xmath3 interactions at eight incident @xmath4 momenta between 514 and 750  mev/@xmath5 have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . an analysis of our @xmath28 data in the c.m .",
    "energy range 1565 to 1600  mev to test the existence of the @xmath20 state has been presented in ref .",
    "an independent analysis of the @xmath29 reaction , using the same data set , was recently presented in ref .",
    "another independent analysis of the @xmath30 and @xmath28 reactions was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we report the experimental results on @xmath0 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 production in @xmath3 interactions at eight incident @xmath4 momenta between 514 and 750  mev/@xmath5 . compared to the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite , our analysis uses kinematic fitting as a part of the event reconstruction .",
    "the subtraction of background reactions is based on our own measurement of them .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the full fiducial volume of the cb spectrometer , which provides us with much larger statistics and non - zero acceptance for the forward production angles . a new partial wave analysis ( pwa ) , involving our results on the differential cross sections for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 production in @xmath3 interactions and the polarizations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , is planned .",
    "this pwa is expected to improve the parameters of the low - mass @xmath13 and @xmath15 states .",
    "the crystal ball multiphoton spectrometer was installed in the c6 beam line of the ags at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "the cb spectrometer is a highly - segmented sphere of 672 nai(tl ) crystals ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cball ] ) .",
    "the sphere has an entrance and exit tunnel for the beam and a 50-cm - diameter spherical cavity in the center .",
    "the solid angle covered by the cb is 93% of @xmath33 steradian .",
    "the cb crystals are packed in two hermetically sealed and evacuated hemispheres .",
    "the crystals have the shape of truncated triangular pyramid ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cbcrystal ] ) , all pointed towards the center of the cb .",
    "the crystal length is 40.6  cm , which corresponds to 15.7 radiation lengths .",
    "the pulse height in every crystal was measured with individual adcs ( analog - to - digital converter ) . for registering the timing information , one tdc ( time - to - digital converter )",
    "was used for every minor triangle , which is a group of nine neighboring crystals . the typical energy resolution for electromagnetic showers in the cb was @xmath34)^{0.36}$ ] .",
    "the directions of the photon showers were measured with a resolution in @xmath35 ( the polar angle with respect to the beam axis ) of @xmath36 , under the assumption that the photons are produced in the center of the cb .",
    "the resolution in azimuthal angle @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "the angular resolutions are mainly defined by the granularity of the cb and do not depend on the energy resolution of the cb crystals .",
    "the situation is slightly different when a photon is produced not in the center of the cb . in this case",
    ", the real angles of the photon must be calculated from an interaction point ( which can be either the primary vertex of the event in the target or the secondary vertex of the outgoing particles decaying in flight ) to the point inside the cb that is determined by the depth of the electromagnetic shower in the nai(tl ) material .",
    "also , the energy and angular resolution of the cb becomes somewhat worse when a photon hits the crystals close to the cb beam tunnels . in this case ,",
    "part of the electromagnetic shower can leak through the side surface of the so - called `` guard '' crystals ( i.e. , the crystals that form the inner surface of the tunnels ) .",
    "the c6 line provided a beam of negative kaons and pions with the @xmath39 ratio enhanced to about 0.1 by two electrostatic separators .",
    "beam particles were incident on a 10-cm - long liquid - hydrogen ( lh@xmath40 ) target located in the center of the crystal ball .",
    "the beam divergences on the target were @xmath41  cm and @xmath42  cm .",
    "the diameter of the target was 10  cm .",
    "the determination of the beam momentum was done with a dipole magnet and a set of four multiwire drift chambers .",
    "one of the chambers was located upstream and the other three downstream of the magnet .",
    "the coordinate resolution of the chambers was @xmath43  mm .",
    "the momentum resolution @xmath44 for an individual incident kaon varied from 0.6% to 1.% , depending on the momentum value .",
    "the largest contribution to the uncertainty in the incident - particle momentum comes from the kaon multiple scattering and energy losses in the beam counters and the lh@xmath40 target .",
    "the mean value @xmath45 for the incident - momentum spectra and the momentum spread @xmath46 , which were determined at the target center , are listed in table  [ tab : events ] .",
    "the uncertainty in determining the mean beam momentum is 23  mev/@xmath5 .",
    "this uncertainty is mainly caused by the precision of the calculation of the magnetic field in the dipole magnet and the energy loss of the incident kaons before they interact in the target .    to monitor the beam particles ,",
    "a system of plastic scintillation counters was used .",
    "this system included the @xmath47 hodoscope upstream and the @xmath48 counter downstream of the dipole magnet , and the @xmath49 counter located 162  cm upstream of the lh@xmath40 target .",
    "the coincidence of signals from @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 served as the beam trigger . the time - of - flight of beam particles between @xmath47 and @xmath49",
    "was used in the trigger and also in the off - line analysis to suppress the background from pion interactions in the target .",
    "the lh@xmath40 target was surrounded by a 16-cm - diameter `` barrel '' made of four plastic scintillation counters that functioned as a veto for the beam interactions with charged particles in the final state .",
    "the 120-cm length of the veto - barrel counters ensured almost 100% rejection of those events .",
    "the 5-mm thickness of the counters implied both a good efficiency of the veto barrel for the charged - particle detection and a low probability for photon conversion .",
    "the cb event trigger was the beam trigger in coincidence with a cb energy trigger , which required the total energy deposited in the crystals to exceed a certain threshold .",
    "the first two layers of the crystals in the cb tunnels ( i.e. , closest to the beam line ) , which had a high occupancy from beam - halo interactions , were excluded from the cb energy trigger .",
    "the cb neutral - event trigger required the anti - coincidence of the cb event trigger with signals from the veto - barrel counters .",
    "more details about the cb setup at the ags and its @xmath3-data analyses can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "since the crystal ball detector is designed as a multiphoton spectrometer , @xmath3 interactions were studied by measuring the photons and the neutron in the final state .",
    "the @xmath50 meson and the @xmath31 and @xmath32 hyperons were measured in the cb by the decay chains @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "as the final - state photons produce electromagnetic showers in the nai(tl ) crystals , they can be recognized as so - called `` clusters '' in the density of the energy deposited in the cb .",
    "the outgoing neutrons can also be detected if the products of their interactions in the nai(tl ) material produce the ionization that is enough to form a cluster .",
    "in general , a cluster in the cb is defined as a group of neighboring crystals in which energy is deposited from the interaction of a photon , a charged particle , or a neutron produced in the final state .",
    "clusters produced by different particle types have different features .",
    "since our analysis involves mainly multi - photon final states , the cluster algorithm was optimized to reconstruct parameters of a photon from its electromagnetic shower with good energy and angular resolution and with a reasonable separation between shower split - offs and overlapping showers .",
    "the software threshold for the cluster energy was chosen to be 20  mev ; this value optimizes the yield of the reconstructed events for the @xmath21 processes under study .",
    "the size of one cluster was limited to a configuration of 22 crystals ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cbclsdraw ] ) , which is large enough to contain the full spread of a photon shower at our energies .",
    "cluster directions were measured as the weighted average of the directions of all crystals forming the cluster .",
    "the weight factor of each crystal in this average was taken as the square root of the crystal energy , @xmath54 .",
    "as the decay time of nai(tl ) is about 250  ns , the high intensity of the incident beam causes good events to be contaminated by so - called pile - up clusters ( i.e. , the clusters remaining from other events ) . since the pile - up clusters change the proper number of the clusters expected in the cb from good events , such events can be lost from consideration unless the pile - up clusters are eliminated .",
    "elimination of the pile - up clusters was based on the tdc information of the crystals forming the clusters . since our good events cause the cb trigger , their clusters have times that are peaked in a restricted timing window .",
    "all clusters that occur outside this window were eliminated from further consideration .",
    "the loss of good events due to the pile - up clusters inside the window were estimated by varying the window width .",
    "the kinematic - fitting technique was used to select candidates for the reactions that were studied . in the present analysis ,",
    "every event with the proper cluster multiplicity was fitted to the following three hypotheses : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 the incident kaon was parameterized in the kinematic fit by five measured variables : momentum , angles @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and position coordinates @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the target .",
    "a photon cluster was parameterized by three measured variables : energy and angles @xmath35 and @xmath37 . as the data were taken with a 10-cm - long lh@xmath40 target , the @xmath62 coordinate of the vertex was a free variable of the kinematic fit .",
    "including @xmath62 into the fit improves the angular resolution of the photons .",
    "the cluster angles @xmath35 and @xmath37 , which were used in the minimization procedure , were calculated with respect to the cb center .",
    "the photon angles , used in the calculation of the kinematic constraints , were defined by the directions from the vertex coordinates to the point determined by the cluster angles and the effective depth of the photon shower in the nai material . in our analysis ,",
    "the effective depth of the electromagnetic shower was defined as the depth where a photon has likely deposited half its initial energy .",
    "for the neutron cluster , the effective depth was taken to be half the length of the crystals .",
    "when the final - state neutron was not detected , its energy and two angles were free variables of the kinematic fit . for the neutron detected in the cb",
    ", the angles of its cluster were used as the measured variables and the neutron energy as a free variable . in our analysis of reactions  ( [ eqn : k0sn ] ) , ( [ eqn : lpi0 ] ) , and ( [ eqn : spi0 ] ) , the detection efficiency for the final - state neutron increases from 21% for our lowest beam momenta to 28% for the highest .",
    "since the major ionization from the neutron passage in the crystals occurs due to recoil protons , the energy of the neutron cluster is very uncertain and can not be used to reconstruct the kinetic energy of the neutron .",
    "many neutrons , especially low - energy ones , produce a signal in the cb that is below the 20-mev - energy threshold used in the cluster reconstruction .",
    "the angular resolution of the cb for neutron clusters is slightly worse than for photon clusters .    since all reactions in our analysis have a particle decaying in flight , the decay length of this particle was also a free variable of the kinematic fit .",
    "the corresponding secondary vertex was then determined from the primary - vertex coordinates , the direction of the decaying particle , and the decay length .",
    "the calculation of the angles of the final - state photons and neutron from the cluster angles , if they were produced from the secondary vertex , is the same as for the primary vertex .        the invariant - mass resolution of the cb after applying the kinematic - fitting technique",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_resl ] .",
    "three invariant - mass spectra are shown for our data at the beam momentum of 750  mev/@xmath5 after testing events for the following hypotheses : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , where the @xmath31 hyperon was identified by its decay into @xmath66 .",
    "the invariant - mass resolution for the @xmath67 peak from @xmath68 decays has @xmath69  mev/@xmath70 , which is comparable to @xmath71  mev/@xmath70 from @xmath72 decays .",
    "the @xmath73 resolution for @xmath74 decays is about 13  mev/@xmath70 .",
    "we can not illustrate the @xmath75 resolution for @xmath76 decays as a constraint on the @xmath31-hyperon mass is used in the kinematic fit for the secondary - vertex determination .",
    "instead , we show the @xmath77 peak from @xmath32 decays , for which @xmath78  mev/@xmath70 .    the candidates for reactions  ( [ eqn : k0sn ] ) and ( [ eqn : lpi0 ] ) were searched for in four - cluster and five - cluster events since these processes have the same final state , including four photons and the neutron .",
    "the four - cluster events were tested for the case when only the four photons were detected in the cb .",
    "the five - cluster events were tested for the case when all five final - state particles were detected .",
    "similarly , the candidates for reaction  ( [ eqn : spi0 ] ) , which have five photons and the neutron in the final state , were searched for in five - cluster and six - cluster events .",
    "the test of each hypothesis involves all possible permutations of assigning the detected clusters to the particles in the reaction chain .",
    "the events for which at least one permutation satisfied the tested hypothesis at the 2% confidence level , c.l .",
    ", ( i.e. , with a probability larger than 2% ) were accepted as the reaction candidates .",
    "the permutation with the largest c.l . was used to reconstruct the kinematics of the reaction .",
    "the candidates selected for our three reactions are contaminated with backgrounds that must be subtracted in the analysis .",
    "the first source of background is from misidentification of events from different @xmath79 reactions . the second source is from processes that are not kaon interactions in the lh@xmath40 target .",
    "the major fraction of these interactions are @xmath4 decays in the beam .",
    "this background was investigated using data samples when the target was empty .",
    "the absolute contribution of this background was determined from the ratio of totals of the beam kaons incident on the full and empty target .",
    "the fraction of the so - called `` empty - target '' background , which left in the reaction candidates after all selection cuts , varies slightly depending on the beam momentum , the reaction itself , and the cuts applied . for our typical selection cuts , which are discussed later on in the text , the remaining empty - target background comprises 6% to 9% for the @xmath80 and @xmath23 candidates and",
    "4% to 6% for the @xmath24 candidates .",
    "this background was subtracted from our experimental production - angle distributions .",
    "a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of reactions  ( [ eqn : k0sn ] ) , ( [ eqn : lpi0 ] ) , and ( [ eqn : spi0 ] ) was used to determine the experimental acceptance and to estimate the fraction of the background coming from misidentification of events from different reactions .",
    "first , all reactions were simulated with an isotropic production - angle distribution . to reproduce the beam structure correctly ,",
    "the information from the experimental beam - trigger events was used as the input for simulating the incident kaons .",
    "the mc events for each beam momentum were then propagated through a full geant ( version 3.21 ) simulation of the cb detector , folded with the cb resolutions and trigger conditions , and analyzed the same way as the experimental data . the small difference between the experimental data and the mc simulation for the neutron response in",
    "the cb was not important , as we summed the events with and without the neutron detected .",
    "the analysis of the mc simulation showed that the largest misidentification of events from different reactions is between processes  ( [ eqn : k0sn ] ) and ( [ eqn : lpi0 ] ) , which have the same final state of four photons .",
    "however , for the events that satisfied both the hypotheses , the c.l . for the `` true '' one was typically larger than for the `` false '' .",
    "therefore , to decrease the background of these reactions from each other to the level of 4% or less , we accepted only the hypothesis with the largest c.l .",
    ", also requiring it to be at least twice as large as the c.l .",
    "for the second hypothesis .",
    "for further suppression of other backgrounds , tightening the cut on the c.l . of the reaction hypothesis",
    "itself can be applied . if the events of each the reaction are selected at the 5% c.l . , the background from process  ( [ eqn : spi0 ] ) was found to be less than 1% for @xmath80 events and less than 2% for @xmath23 events .",
    "the @xmath24 events were contaminated by a background from process  ( [ eqn : lpi0 ] ) to the level less than 2% , and from processes  ( [ eqn : k0sn ] ) and @xmath81 to the level less than 1% .",
    "the low levels of the background contamination were achieved in part by applying a cut on the @xmath62 coordinate of the primary vertex of the event and on the decay length of the @xmath82 meson and the @xmath31 hyperon .",
    "the @xmath62-coordinate and decay - length distributions together with the cuts are illustrated for the experimental data and the mc simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig : zvrt_dlen_kn_lp ] .",
    "the small difference between the experimental data and mc simulation is due to the remaining background that is not subtracted from the experimental distributions .",
    "the deviation of the @xmath62 distributions from the target shape is determined by the resolution of the kinematic fit in @xmath62 , which is about 2  cm .",
    "similarly , the actual decay - length distributions are smeared with the resolution of 3  cm .",
    "the acceptance for reactions @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 was determined as a function of @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the production angle of the final - state meson ( i.e. , the angle between the direction of the outgoing meson and the incident @xmath4 meson ) in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) system .",

    "these acceptances include the effects of all our standard cuts used for the event selection .",
    "a poorer @xmath86 acceptance of the forward @xmath87 angles for a higher beam momentum is mostly due to the larger threshold on the cb total energy in the event trigger .",
