    "entanglement is not only one of the most fascinating features of quantum theory that has puzzled generations of physicists , but also an essential resource in quantum information @xcite .",

    "a number of measures have been proposed to quantify entanglement , such as concurrence @xcite , negativity @xcite and tangle @xcite .",

    "original methods of experimentally detecting entanglement are entanglement witnesses ( ews ) @xcite which , however , require some a priori knowledge on the state to be detected . on the other hand , quantum state tomography needs rapidly growing experimental resources as the dimensionality of the system increases . to overcome shortcoming of ews and the tomography , mintert _ et al .",

    "the convex roof construction for mixed state concurrence indicates that any direct decomposition of the state @xmath3 into pure states will yield an upper bound of the entanglement of @xmath3 .",
    "however , for arbitrary experimental _ unknown _ mixed states , the observable upper bound is non - trivial since it also provides an estimation of entanglement as well as the lower bound in experiments .    in this paper , we present observable upper bounds of squared concurrence which , together with the observable lower bounds introduced by mintert _",

    "@xcite , @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the universal state inverter @xmath78 is a semi - positive definite operator , since each term in the sum @xmath83 is semi - positive definite .",

    "@xcite has proved the subadditivity of the linear entropy .",
    "furthermore , the triangle inequality of the linear entropy can be proved from the subadditivity @xcite .",
    "compared with this earlier proof , roughly speaking , our proof is a little simpler .",
    "the main purpose of this section is that these properties of the linear entropy are the natural results from the positive semidefiniteness of the universal state inverter and the upper and lower bounds , and they also indicate the validity of these bounds .",
    "actually , for two - qubit states , @xmath89 is a tighter upper bound of squared concurrence than @xmath90 . because the equation @xmath91 holds for arbitrary two - qubit states , where @xmath92 .",
    "( [ pminus ] ) has also been proved in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , notice that @xmath93 , where @xmath94 are squared roots of eigenvalues of @xmath95 in the decreasing order . therefore , it is easily concluded that @xmath96 .",
    "however , the new upper bound @xmath97 is hard to generalize to arbitrary finite - dimensional bipartite states .",
    "we give a brief discussion on the experimental measurement of our upper bound . as only the projector @xmath35 on one of the subsystems , rather than a complete set of observables ,",
    "is required , our upper bound could be easily measured .",
    "in particular , for two - dimensional systems , @xmath35 is simply the projector onto the singlet state .",
    "let us take the photonic system for example .",
    "the simplest way to project two photons onto the singlet state is using a hong - ou - mandel interferometer @xcite .",
    "this method has been widely used since the teleportation @xcite experiment .",
    "another method , employed in @xcite , is distinguishing the bell states with a controlled - not gate , which can transform the bell states to separable states @xcite .    in conclusion , we present observable upper bounds of squared concurrence , which are the dual bound of the observable lower bounds introduced by mintert _",
    "et al._. these bounds can estimate entanglement for arbitrary finite - dimensional experimental unknown states by few experimental measurements on a twofold copy @xmath0 of the mixed states . furthermore , the degree of mixing for a mixed state and some properties of the linear entropy also have certain relations with its upper and lower bounds of squared concurrence .",
    "last but not least , we discuss a tighter upper bound for two - qubit states only , and it remains an open question to generalize it to arbitrary finite - dimensional bipartite systems .",
