    "galactic globular clusters are among the largest and oldest stellar systems in the milky way .",
    "they contain thousands to millions of stars at approximately the same distance from the sun : their cluster half - light radii are @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while their distances are larger than @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the stars forming the globular clusters are considered excellent laboratories to study stellar evolution .",
    "they are assumed to be part of a simple stellar population , meaning that all stars have been formed at essentially the same time , from the same cloud and have the same initial chemical composition @xcite .",
    "more precise investigations have shown that most of the globular clusters are not composed of a simple stellar population ; instantaneous star formation and complete chemical homogeneity of the original cloud should not be expected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an extreme case is that of @xmath3 centauri , which clearly has multiple main sequences @xcite and a double white dwarf cooling sequence @xcite .",
    "however , such features are not so extreme .",
    "nevertheless , globular clusters remain excellent laboratories , composed of stars from the central hydrogen - burning limit in the main sequence to cool white dwarf stars .",
    "the white dwarf phase is the evolutionary endpoint of stars with initial masses lower than roughly 10@xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus they represent the collective fate of @xmath597% of the stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue that white dwarf stars in clusters offer an advantage over field white dwarf stars in that they provide the opportunity to constrain the initial - to - final mass relation . besides , most of the globular clusters are mono - metallic systems with respect to iron , with a minimum spread in age .",
    "moreover , the local densities of the halo , thick , and thin disk white dwarf populations are lower than their local density in a globular cluster , making it possible to observe large samples of white dwarfs without the need for wide - field surveys .",
    "there are several substantial obstacles in the study of white dwarf stars in globular clusters : they are more distant than the neighbouring stars , the effect of crowding is significant and white dwarf stars are very faint , requiring deep photometric observations with high quality . in that context , @xcite pointed out that only when it were possible to examine the faint white dwarf stars in globular clusters it would be possible to empirically test the effects of advanced age and low - metallicity progenitors .",
    "the globular clusters ngc6397 , 47tuc and m4 are the first ones that have data reaching the red end of the white dwarf cooling sequence , thus providing the means to study stellar evolution and the coolest observable white dwarf stars in globular clusters in an unprecedented way .",
    "the pioneering results achieved by @xcite with deep hst / acs of ngc6397 showed , for the first time , the colour - magnitude diagram of a globular cluster down to the main sequence hydrogen - burning limit , and pointed the existence of a red cut - off in the white dwarf cooling sequence at @xmath6=27.8 . using artificial star tests and star - galaxy separation , @xcite demonstrated that the cut - off represents a real truncation of the white dwarf stars luminosity function and estimated the age of ngc6397 to be @xmath7gyr .",
    "more recently , with the same method , @xcite determined the age of the metal rich globular cluster 47tuc as being @xmath8gyr , finding that this cluster is approximately 2gyr younger than ngc6397 .",
    "however , @xcite determined an age of @xmath9gyr for 47tuc , also using the cooling sequence method but with different models .",
    "this brought up questions about the reliability of ages determined through the white dwarf cooling sequence @xcite and the importance of the theoretical evolutionary models used .",
    "when @xcite compared their best fit model to the data , they noticed that the only features of the observations that were not well reproduced by their best fit models were the blue colours at magnitudes around f814w=27.25 , indicating a mismatch between theoretical and true colours at the faintest temperatures ( t@xmath10 ) .",
    "they argued that the mismatch between models and data indicated either residual deficiencies in the models or that the atmospheres could be composed of a mixture of hydrogen and helium .",
    "they also proposed that the blue turn in the colours was driven by collision - induced absorption of molecular hydrogen , a significant effect on environments composed of molecules or dense , neutral and non - polar atoms @xcite . for non - polar molecules ,",
    "collision - induced absorption may become the dominant source of opacity over a wide range of the infrared part of the spectrum .",
    "hydrogen and helium are the most abundant atoms in stellar atmospheres but helium does not form molecules and @xmath11 is non - polar ; therefore , both collision - induced absorption involving h and he ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , and molecules composed of less abundant elements ( c , n , o , ti , and others ) , if present , dominate the opacity in cool stars .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that the blue hook seen in white dwarf cooling sequences of clusters is mainly caused by a spread in mass . in a star cluster ,",
    "the massive white dwarf stars form first from the most massive progenitors and , as time goes by , the less massive white dwarf stars only get to the top of the cooling sequence . also , the more massive the white dwarf star is , the smaller it is and the slower it cools - until crystallisation .",
    "so , in a star cluster , as the star evolves , the white dwarf cooling sequence becomes redder in the colour - magnitude diagram , and the less massive white dwarf stars reach the luminosity of the more massive ones , causing the blue turn at the bottom of the cooling sequence .    with hst photometry",
    ", @xcite reached the end of the white dwarf cooling sequence of the open clusters ngc6791 , ngc2158 and ngc6819 , that also presented the blue turn feature",
    ". for ngc6791 , they determined a discrepancy between the age from the white dwarf stars ( 6gyr ) and that from the main sequence turnoff ( 8gyr ) .",
    "@xcite argued that , if only the carbon - oxygen phase separation is taken into account , the age of ngc6791 , determined by white dwarf cooling sequence would increase to only @xmath14gyr , in disagreement with the age determinations by the main sequence turn - off ( @xmath15gyr , @xcite ) .",
    "but , if they considered a combination of @xmath16ne sedimentation and carbon - oxygen phase separation @xcite , the white dwarf age corresponded to @xmath17gyr @xcite .",
    "they also argued that the blue turn in the white dwarf cooling sequence is caused by the most massive white dwarf stars of the cluster , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the blue turn feature observed in ngc6397 , and also detected in the globular clusters m4 and 47tuc @xcite , has been discussed by @xcite , in terms of collision induced absorption , instead of a mass effect .",
    "the truncation of the white dwarf cooling sequence is a very sensitive age indicator as it is the limit at which most white dwarfs can have cooled in the lifetime of a cluster @xcite , demanding an accurate description of this feature in order to obtain precise determinations of the ages of the clusters through the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "our main goal is to investigate the white dwarf cooling sequences of globular clusters .",
    "we use our isochrone models of the white dwarf cooling sequences calculated with metallicities consistent with the ones from each cluster and fix the initial - to - final mass function to the metallicity dependent ones from @xcite .",
    "thus , we determine the distance modulus , reddening , age and the parameter @xmath18 from the present day local mass function for ngc6397 and 47tuc .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sect .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we perform our analysis based on the photometric data of the white dwarf stars belonging to the globular clusters ngc6397 , 47tucanae and m4 ( fig . [ 3clus ] ) , obtained with the _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( acs ) of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "these clusters are the only globulars to date with available data reaching the red end of the white dwarf cooling sequence , showing the turn towards bluer colours for the coolest white dwarf stars .",
    "the deep photometry of ngc6397 was obtained by @xcite as part of a large observation program in _ hst _ cycle 13 ( go-10424 , pi : h. richer ) totalling 126 orbits .",
    "the data consists of 252 exposures ( 179.7ks ) in the f814w filter and 126 exposures ( 93.4ks ) in f606w .",
    "after they obtained the photometry , @xcite applied image spread tests to determine which sources were stellar ( star - galaxy separation ) . to obtain the proper motion cleaned colour - magnitude diagram , @xcite determined the displacements between the 2005 acs data and the wfpc2 images taken in 1994 and 1997 , centred at the same coordinates , with respect to member stars , and with this , the zero point of motion of the cluster .",
    "all stars lying below the 2@xmath19 error box in the proper motion distribution in each magnitude were considered cluster members @xcite .      for 47tuc",
    "our analysis was based on the photometric data obtained with 121 orbits in _ hst _ cycle 17 ( go-11677 , pi : h. richer ) .",
    "@xcite describe the observations as 117 long exposures in f606w ( 163.7ks ) and 125 in f814w ( 172.8ks ) .",
    "the observations were centred at about 6.7arcmin west of the cluster centre which had previous data observed with acs , making it possible to obtain the proper motion separation , in a similar way to the study made by @xcite for ngc6397 .",
    "[ [ m4 ] ] m4 ~~    @xcite were able to reach the end of the white dwarf cooling sequence , at m@xmath200.1 , with 14 _ hst _ orbits .",
    "the m4 data was obtained in different programs , consisting of 20 exposures in the f606w filter ( 10 orbits ) and 4 exposures in f775w ( 2 _ hst _ orbits ) as part of the program go-10146 ( pi : l. bedin ) in _ hst _ cycle 13 , and f775w filter data from _ hst _ cycle 11 ( go-9578 , pi : j. rhodes ) , consisting of 10 exposures of 360 s ( 2 _ hst _ orbits ) .",
    "the program go-10146 also obtained short exposures in both f606w and f814w filters , and f606w archival material from program go-10775 ( pi : sarajedini ) .",
    "proper motions were measured with a technique similar to that described in @xcite , also considering the zero point of the motion of the cluster .",
    "white dwarf evolutionary models used in our analysis are those computed by @xcite for different metallicities .",
    "these models are the result of computations employing the lpcode evolutionary code , the same code used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they computed the evolution from the zero age main sequence , through the hydrogen and helium central burning stages , the full thermally pulsing and mass loss stages on the asymptotic giant branch , and finally through the white dwarf cooling curve .",
    "the models also incorporate the effects of possible residual hydrogen burning present in low - metallicity progenitors , for which the mass loss is less efficient and as a result , the thickness of the hydrogen layer left on the white dwarf model increases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "then , the larger the hydrogen mass on the envelope of the white dwarf the more efficient the residual burning at high effective temperatures on the cooling sequence @xcite .    here",
    ", we briefly mention some of the main input physics relevant for this work .",
    "a detailed description can be found in @xcite and @xcite . during the white dwarf cooling ,",
    "the code considers element diffusion due to gravitational settling , chemical and thermal diffusion @xcite . at effective temperatures below @xmath21k on the cooling curve ,",
    "the outer boundary conditions are derived from non - grey atmosphere models from @xcite which include the tail of ly@xmath18 in the optical @xcite .",
    "the release of latent heat and gravitational energy due to carbon - oxygen phase separation is included following the @xcite phase diagram , consistent with the observations by @xcite and the massive pulsating white dwarf stars studied in @xcite .",
    "we consider main sequence masses from @xmath50.8 to @xmath56.0 @xmath4 , where the low mass limit depends on metallicity .",
    "the resulting white dwarf models show stellar mass values from @xmath50.50 to @xmath51.00@xmath22 .",
    "note that this mass interval corresponds to carbon - oxygen core stars .",
    "we consider the mass of the white dwarf as the actual final mass in the cooling curve , not the approximation of the mass of the hydrogen free core at the first thermal pulse . at the end of the agb stage ,",
    "when the star becomes a thermally pulsing tp - agb star , the mass of the hydrogen free core will increase with each thermal pulse .",
    "@xcite estimated a growth of the core mass between 10% to 30% for a progenitor of 1.6 - 2.0@xmath4 .",
    "therefore the mass at the cooling curve is larger than the core mass at the first thermal pulse , leading to a different initial - to - final mass prescription .",
    "figure [ masstwd ] shows the initial - to - final mass relation resulting from @xcite computations for z=0.0001 and z=0.004 . with filled circles we depict the initial - to - final mass with a white dwarf",
    "mass correspond to the mass of the model at the cooling curve , while hollow circles shows the mass of the hydrogen free core at the first thermal pulse . at the low mass end ,",
    "the increase of the core mass during the tp - agb is small , because of the small number of thermal pulses .",
    "however , as the initial mass increases , the number of thermal pulses also increases and so will the mass of the hydrogen free core .",
    "@xcite compare their results with those obtained by other authors .",
    "they found that , at the low mass end the initial - to - final mass agrees with that of @xcite , especially for high metallicity progenitors , while for high masses and low metallicities the differences became more important .",
    "the white dwarf masses from @xcite are smaller than those from @xcite , because @xcite calculations allow overshooting during the tp - agb , limiting the growth of the hydrogen - free core .",
    "in fact , the initial - to - final from @xcite resembles the initial - to - final mass of @xcite for the core mass at the first thermal pulse .",
    "note that pre - white dwarf ages for high mass progenitors , where the effects of overshooting during the tp - agb are more important , do not change considerably with initial mass ( see tab . 1 from @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also compared sequences with initial mass 1@xmath22 and metallicity of z=0.0001 and z=0.02 using mesa @xcite including similar mass loss . as a result",
    ", they found that lpcode lifetimes were consistent with those computed with mesa , resulting in differences smaller than @xmath23myr at @xmath525000k on the white dwarf cooling curve .    in order to extend our mass range ,",
    "we included additional white dwarf sequences with stellar masses up to @xmath24 , corresponding to progenitor masses up to @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "we adopt the initial - to - final mass from @xcite for carbon - oxygen white dwarf remnants with the metallicities of @xmath26 and @xmath28 . to compute the white dwarf evolution",
    ", we took a white dwarf model at high effective temperatures at the beginning of the cooling curve for the highest stellar mass evolutionary model available in our original grid , and artificially scaled the stellar mass from @xcite .",
    "we also changed the carbon / oxygen central composition to match that from @xcite for each stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "the pre - wd ages were taken from @xcite computations .",
    "further evolution on the white dwarf cooling sequence was computed employing the lpcode , including all physical ingredients considered in white dwarf computations from full evolution .",
    "figure [ massifkalsal ] shows the initial - to - final mass extended to progenitor masses of @xmath29 .",
    "filled circles corresponds to full evolutionary computations ( same as figure [ masstwd ] ) while hollow circles correspond to @xcite results .",
    "we also compare with the semi - empirical initial - to - final mass from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that semi - empirical determinations of the initial - to - final mass relations do not take different metallicities into account .",
    "we use the colours of the white dwarf cooling models consistent with those from recent results by @xcite that include the lyman-@xmath18 red wing calculations from @xcite . the @xmath30 molecule in the equation of state , which becomes very important at @xmath31 ,",
    "is also included @xcite .",
    "we also explored the possibility of white dwarf atmospheric models composed by a mixture of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the colours of the atmosphere models with hydrogen and helium mixed consider thick hydrogen layers ( @xmath32 ) for low he / h ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "for higher he / h values , thin hydrogen layers ( @xmath34 ) were considered .",
    "those models were calculated ranging from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite argued that the difficulty in age determination through the main sequence turn - off lies in the fact that the differences between two or more clusters can be due to metallicity and/or age differences .",
    "they compared the white dwarf cooling sequences of 47tuc , ngc6397 and m4 , considering the properties , distance modulus and reddening .",
    "they demonstrated that the white dwarf cooling sequences of those three clusters almost align perfectly in the colour - magnitude diagram , as seen in fig .",
    "[ 3clus ] , even though they have different metallicities .",
    "this is consistent with the timescales of diffusion processes in the white dwarf atmospheres @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that white dwarf spectra and location on the colour - magnitude diagram do not depend on the cluster metal abundance , unless there is a possible dependence of the white dwarf mass on metallicity through the initial - to - final mass relation @xcite .",
    "our first step was comparing our pure hydrogen isochrone models ( sect .",
    "[ models ] ) , with the ages determined by @xcite , to the white dwarf cooling sequences of ngc6397 ( 11.7gyr ) and 47tuc ( 9.9gyr ) . in fig .",
    "[ puremodels ] we can see that , especially for 47tuc , the `` blue branch '' of the model happens at a brighter magnitude than the one from the data . also , if we compare the mean ridge line of the data ( blue dot - dashed line ) to the isocrhone models , for both clusters , fig .",
    "[ puremodels ] also highlights a change in the slope of the white dwarf cooling sequence after f606w@xmath514.5 , showing a trend for the models to be bluer ( brighter ) than the data , that is , a red offset of the data .    such trend could be caused by problems in the photometric calibration , so , before we began our analysis , we calculated the mean ridge line of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) that is present in the non proper motion - corrected data of 47tuc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in an attempt to test this hypothesis .",
    "the mean ridge line of the smc does not present the same trend towards redder colours as the one from the white dwarf cooling sequence of 47tuc , indicating that poor photometric calibration is , apparently , not causing this slope change .",
    "this mismatch between models and data in the white dwarf cooling sequence is in the same line of problems found in the comparison of main sequence models to the data .",
    "for example , @xcite has shown that for low mass main sequence stars  the coolest stars in the main sequence ",
    "the data is redder than the models , even after they adopt better bolometric correction tables and new @xmath37 relations .",
    "they also mention that this problem seems to extend to other sets of models in the literature .    clearly , there are aspects of the construction of the models of white dwarf stars that need further investigation .",
    "we estimate that @xmath38% of the total number of observed white dwarf stars lie on the red offset portion .",
    "one possible explanation for the red offset of the white dwarf stars could be a fraction of pure helium atmosphere white dwarf stars that would move the models to bluer colours .",
    "white dwarf masses would have to be @xmath50.55m@xmath39 at the bottom of the cooling sequence for the models to deviate as much as the data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite included the fraction of helium atmosphere in their analysis of the white dwarf population of m4 .",
    "@xcite treated it as a free parameter and estimated an upper limit of 40% , while @xcite fixed the fraction at 30% , the typical value for the db / da ratio in the disk population .",
    "however , @xcite analysed the spectra of 24 bright white dwarf stars in the line of sight of m4 and determined that all had hydrogen atmospheres .",
    "they argued that if all the 24 white dwarf stars were members of the cluster , the probability of observing helium atmosphere white dwarf stars is @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite thoroughly discussed the probability of finding helium atmosphere white dwarf stars in globular clusters , including results from other authors .",
    "they concluded that it is clear that the hydrogen / helium white dwarf stars atmosphere ratio in globular clusters is lower than in the field and that even though it is not impossible to form a non - hydrogen atmosphere in the cluster environment , the formation mechanism is clearly strongly suppressed .",
    "so , it is very unlikely that a fraction of 30 to 40% of helium atmosphere white dwarf stars are observed in globular clusters .",
    "@xcite only used the spectra of hot white dwarf stars in globular clusters .",
    "however , there is little spectra information on white dwarf stars with effective temperatures lower than @xmath5 5000k .",
    "@xcite performed a census of white dwarf stars within 40pc of the sun and found that probably most white dwarf stars with t@xmath41 5000k have pure hydrogen atmospheres .",
    "however , they pointed out that the results below t@xmath42 = 5000k should be considered with caution . depending on the resolution ,",
    "the spectra of ultra cool white dwarf stars do not show hydrogen or helium lines , thus providing no information on their surface gravities .",
    "so , inferences on the composition of the atmosphere can only be modelled with an analysis of the energy distribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite independently proposed the existence of a convective mixing between the massive helium layer and the thin hydrogen layer above it for cool white dwarf stars .",
    "when in the mixing process , the convection zone of a hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf star eventually reaches the underlying helium layer , helium will be brought to the surface through convective motion , resulting in the mixing of hydrogen and helium layers .",
    "@xcite showed that the surface gravities , inferred from spectroscopy of a sample containing 37 cool white dwarf stars ( @xmath43 ) , were significantly larger than the canonical value expected for these stars ( @xmath44 ) , and that was interpreted as an evidence of the convective mixing between the hydrogen and helium layers .",
    "however , with high signal - to - noise , high - resolution spectroscopic observations for six cool da white dwarf stars ( @xmath45 ) , obtained with the keck i telescope , @xcite detected no helium in the spectra of any of the target stars , concluding that their helium abundance allowed to rule out the incomplete convective mixing scenario as the source of the high - log@xmath46 problem .",
    "later , @xcite found that the the imprecise convection calculation was suppressing the convective mixing scenario .",
    "the results from @xcite do not rule out the hypothesis of mixed atmosphere for ultra - cool white dwarf stars ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "calculations by @xcite indicate that the effective temperature at which the mixing would occur depends on the thickness of the hydrogen envelope , meaning that , the thicker the envelope , the lower the mixing temperature .",
    "@xcite showed that the mixing should not occur if the mass of the hydrogen layer is larger than @xmath48 .",
    "@xcite presented a theoretical analysis of white dwarf stars with the hydrogen layer mass between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "they showed that a white dwarf star , upon convective mixing , always decreases the amount of hydrogen on the surface , but the spectral outcome and the change in the effective temperature depends on the mass of the hydrogen layer .",
    "the existence of white dwarfs with the thickness of the hydrogen layer between @xmath51 was shown by @xcite and @xcite , through asterosismological studies .",
    "@xcite argue that this indicates that white dwarfs with an atmosphere of h , even if their total masses are close to the most probable value , may have formed with a h mass several orders of magnitude smaller than the value predicted by theory , i.e. , it is likely that the mass loss during its evolution was actually more efficient than assumed by evolutionary models including mass loss of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most probable scenario is that the star might have experienced a late thermal pulse that consumed most of its hydrogen layer leaving a very thin ( @xmath52 ) hydrogen layer .",
    "preliminary tests with our models show that , for the mixing of hydrogen and helium to occur at temperatures consistent with the change in slope of the models ( @xmath53 ) , the mass of the hydrogen layer should be between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and the atmosphere would not be turned into pure helium .",
    "instead , the atmosphere would be composed by hydrogen with traces of helium .",
    "when this mixing occurs , the atmosphere becomes more transparent and appears slightly hotter , causing a shift to a brighter magnitude ; after that , the star continues to cool , but not as a pure hydrogen atmosphere anymore .",
    "this effect could be the reason of the observed slope change of the white dwarf cooling sequence from the globular clusters ; however , this requires further investigation and proper modelling of the convective processes .    also , to perform an analysis of such cold white dwarf stars with mixed atmospheres",
    ", we should consider that , bellow 16000k , line broadening by neutral particles becomes important at helium rich atmospheres @xcite .",
    "however , only some he transitions have so - called self broadening theories , and they were tested for very low temperatures ( 300k ) . how calculations for appropriate temperatures would affect the models is still unknown .    assuming that mixing of hydrogen and helium occurs in the atmosphere of the very cool white dwarf stars ( @xmath56 ) , @xcite studied the near - uv absorption in white dwarf stars with models containing the revised calculations of @xmath57 collision - induced absorption opacity from @xcite .",
    "we compared our single mass white dwarf model for 0.60@xmath4 with log(he / h)=0 to the one by @xcite with the newest opacity , with the same parameters , and we found no difference between models with the new and old @xmath13 collision induced absorptions for @xmath585000k .",
    "@xcite mention the fact that @xmath12 calculations are still in progress , so if they will help to solve the red offset problem is an important open question .",
    "@xcite pointed that an important part of modelling monte carlo simulations is the need to have the same observational scatter and incompleteness as the data .",
    "this is even more important for white dwarf stars , as even the brightest ones could be lost if they are close to a bright main sequence star . to take that into account , @xcite performed artificial star tests so they could measure the recovery fraction and determine the association between input and observed magnitude .    to obtain the cluster parameters we used our isochrone models to generate monte carlo realisations of the white dwarf populations and compared them with the observed cooling sequences .",
    "our monte carlo simulations follow an inverse transform sampling @xcite . for the mass interval represented in the observed luminosity function",
    ", we are assuming a single burst star formation and a @xcite distribution ( dn / dm@xmath59 ) for the present day local mass function .",
    "we allowed @xmath18 to vary from 1.6 to 4.0 .",
    "as we are not considering any dynamical effects in our models , we are only obtaining the present day local mass function .",
    "as the mass of the progenitor star represented in the observed luminosity function from the white dwarf stars is only from 0.85 to @xmath56.00 , we assumed a single burst star formation .",
    "we also adopt the metallicity dependent initial - to - final mass relation from @xcite and generate models with a range of distance modulus and reddening appropriate to each cluster .    to account for the size of the photometric errors , for each model white dwarf star",
    "we add a photometric uncertainty that was determined through artificial star tests consistent with ngc6397 and 47tuc @xcite .",
    "the artificial star tests provide not only the degree of correlation between the input and observed magnitudes , but also the recovery fraction , i.e. , the photometric completeness of the data , which is also taken into account in our simulations .",
    "this process was applied for both f606w and f814w filters .",
    "thus , each realisation includes realistic photometric scatter and the correct level of completeness .",
    "our monte carlo simulations do not account for the effect of multiple star formation bursts , unresolved binaries or multiple populations .    to reduce model uncertainties we generated simulations with 20000 stars . observed and model luminosity functions are built with bins of 0.20mag ; hess diagrams",
    "are binned with a grid width of 0.1 mag in f606w - f814w and 0.25mag in f606w , a grid similar to that used in previous analysis of the same data @xcite , as shown in fig",
    ". [ grid ] .",
    "simulations are normalised to have the same number of stars as the corresponding cluster .    to compare the hess diagrams of the models and the observations we used the reduced @xmath60 which is the sum of the residuals taking the density of the observed and model of each grid cell into account , according to : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of events expected according to the model @xmath63 is the number observed in the ith bin and , as we assume our data follow a poisson distribution , @xmath64 is the uncertainty in the number of observed stars ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we compute independent @xmath66 tests for the luminosity function and for the hess diagram .",
    "the @xmath66 tests for the colour functions is not computed because the red offset masks the information .",

    "it is noticeable that the model reproduces the blue turn very well , even though the blue branch of our model is shorter than the data because the photometric scatter for these data is very high and currently the highest progenitor mass we have in our model , for the metallicity of m4 , is 2.25@xmath4 .",
    "this model shows that the range of masses of the white dwarf stars is between @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "again , the mass at the top of the white dwarf cooling sequence is consistent with the results from spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we also over - plotted a 11.6gyr white dwarf isochrone obtained by @xcite ( dashed blue line ) to compare with our model .",
    "although @xcite models have a wider blue branch , because the highest progenitor mass in their model is @xmath82 , the shape of their model is completely consistent with ours and , also , @xcite models show that the blue turn is due the increasing masses .",
    "our age determinations are consistent with those obtained by @xcite using what they call the improved version of the @xmath83 method .",
    "they found13.00@xmath680.25gyr for ngc6397 and 11.75@xmath680.25gyr for 47tuc that , within the uncertainties , agree with our values .",
    "in addition , our age value for 47tuc is consistent , within the uncertainties , with the @xmath84gyr determined by @xcite also using the cooling sequence method . and",
    "our determination for ngc6397 also agrees with the 12.8@xmath85gyr determined by @xcite using the white dwarf cooling sequence .    to demonstrate the effect of our age determinations on the age - metallicity relation , we show in fig .",
    "[ agemet ] the age , determined through white dwarf cooling sequence , versus the metallicity for galactic population , similar to what was done by @xcite .",
    "it is possible to see that m4 has an intermediate metallicity when compared to 47tuc and ngc6397 , and , apparently , also an intermediate age .",
    "this reinforces the age - metallicity relation stating that the metal - poor formed earlier than the metal - rich globular clusters .    the comparison between the white dwarf cooling data and the monte carlo model that best fits the data presents an excellent agreement , as can be seen in figs .

    "however , the scattering in the model of 47tuc seems to be higher than the one from the data , indicating that the scatter of the artificial star tests could be overestimated .",
    "also , the red offset problem is not corrected even when we include the photometric scatter in the models .",
    "our monte carlo simulations do not include multiple star formation bursts , unresolved binaries or multiple populations .",
    "thus , the small discrepancies between our models and the data may be related to the lack of those effects.we discuss more in the following paragraphs .",
    "@xcite found a low value ( @xmath86 ) for the binary fraction in ngc6397 , which is very similar to the @xmath87 fraction found for the main sequence stars by @xcite .",
    "the latter authors also determined the binary fraction for 47tuc as being @xmath88 , arguing that , for globular clusters , the binary fraction slowly decreases with dynamical age , i.e. , above 10 relaxation times , there should be no clusters with binary fractions above 6% .",
    "@xcite find that a burst of star formation for 47tuc occurred between 0.7@xmath680.5gyr and 1.0@xmath680.5gyr , depending on the distribution employed .",
    "@xcite also attempted to determine the burst of star formation for ngc6397 .",
    "however , their best fit obtained the duration of the burst of star formation as being @xmath89=3.3gyr .",
    "they argued that , with the high accuracy photometric data obtained with hubble space telescope , such an extended episode of star formation would be detectable in the colour - magnitude diagram of main sequence stars , which is not the case .",
    "so , they conclude that the photometric data available for the white dwarf stars of ngc6397 is not appropriate for this kind of analysis and they adopt a initial burst of star formation as being 1.0gyr .    in fig .",
    "[ burst ] we show a comparison between the observed luminosity function from ngc6397 to a simulated one with two bursts of star formation with 1gyr difference ( 11.93gyr and 12.93gyr ) . we notice that this model does not present a feature that is clearly present in the data : the crystallization peak .",
    "this feature is present in our single burst star formation model presented in fig .",
    "[ lfourricher08 ] . that could be an indication that the age difference between two bursts , if present , should be smaller than 1gyr for ngc6397 .",
    "@xcite found that for certain filters , the photometry of 47tuc splits not only the main sequence in two branches , but also the sub - giant , red - giant regions and on the horizontal branch .",
    "their results indicated that the differences between the two main sequences could be explained in terms of two stellar generations , one of them being formed by the primordial he , and o - rich / n - poor stars , and the other corresponding to a second generation population that was enriched in he and n but depleted in o. the he content would be y=0.256 for the primordial population and y=0.272 for the second generation .",
    "@xcite accounted for he enrichment consistent with the one obtained by @xcite , but they concluded that the resulting differences in the models do not lead to significant changes in the cooling age .",
    "when we determine the distance modulus and reddening with the white dwarf stars hotter than 5500k , our reddening determinations are systematically smaller than the ones determined with the main sequence fitting , with a @xmath900.07 .",
    "this could indicate that the white dwarf stars hotter than 5500k are somehow slightly redder than the main sequence stars .    for ngc6397 and 47tuc clusters our monte carlo simulations present a strong turn to the blue at the faint magnitudes , caused by increasing masses , and the temperature at this point is @xmath54300k . the collision - induced absorption , as it is currently described ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , would only be noticeable in infra - red colours ( @xmath91 ) , taking place at much lower temperatures , causing the second turn , but now to red colours as argued by @xcite .",
    "they claim that , at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath92 ) , the white dwarf isochrone becomes populated by more massive white dwarf stars , and those are less blue because of the different cooling speed and onset of the collision - induced absorption , causing a red turn in the white dwarf cooling sequence for near infra - red isochrone models .",
    "when we focus on the slope of the present day local mass function , we find that @xmath18=2.17@xmath93 for ngc6397 , that is slightly different from the canonical @xmath18=2.35 from @xcite , and consistent with a top - heavy type , as has already been suggested by @xcite and references therein .",
    "in contrast , the value of @xmath18=3.42@xmath77 obtained as the best fit to 47tuc data is very different from the canonical .",
    "however , it must be noted that we are analysing data from a single region of the cluster .",
    "the very high alpha determined for 47tuc indicates a bottom heavy present day local mass function in that portion of the cluster , i.e. , the present day local mass function of 47tuc is deficient in more massive white dwarf stars .",
    "such a lack of massive white dwarf stars could be related to the diffusion due to gravitational relaxation that was detected for 47tuc by @xcite . by analysing the data from the core of 47tuc",
    ", @xcite detected that the spatial distribution of young ( less massive ) white dwarf stars is significantly more centrally concentrated than the older ( more massive ) ones , indicating that the white dwarf distribution seems to be more radially diffuse with increasing age @xcite .",
    "as the data we are using in our analysis is very close to the centre ( r@xmath5=8.8pc ) , while the tidal radius is r@xmath9452.0pc , a bottom heavy present day local mass function is another indicator of the lack of massive white dwarf stars near the centre of 47tuc .    a feature highlighted in fig .",
    "[ ngc6397mc ] and fig .",
    "[ 47tucmc ] is that the models , built with the initial - to - final mass relation of @xcite , show a spread in mass ranging from @xmath50.525m@xmath39 , at the top of the cooling sequence , to @xmath50.875m@xmath39 , for ngc6397 , and @xmath50.520m@xmath39 to @xmath50.817m@xmath39 , for 47tuc .",
    "the mass at the truncation for ngc6397 is significantly larger than the @xmath95 estimated by @xcite for the same data .",
    "the models @xcite used to determine the pre - white dwarf times attempted to take the effect of the metallicity into account . however , they considered as the white dwarf mass that at the first thermal pulse in the agb .",
    "this approach , by not taking all the thermal pulses into account causes the major difference between the values of the final masses ( fig .",
    "[ masstwd ] ) .",
    "another point that should be emphasised is that our models that best fit the data lead to masses at the top of the white dwarf cooling sequence of @xmath96 for ngc6397 and @xmath97 for 47tuc , that are consistent with the values found with spectroscopy of the brightest white dwarf stars in ngc6397 , ngc6752 and m4 ( @xmath98 , @xcite ; @xmath99 , @xcite ) .",
    "the first colour - magnitude diagrams of globular clusters down to the cutoff in the white dwarf cooling sequence exposed unprecedented features .",
    "one of these is the blue turn at magnitudes around m@xmath100 which was not well reproduced by single mass white dwarf models .",
    "the effect of different model assumptions on the mass spread of the white dwarf stars and the importance of a consistent and detailed computation of their cooling evolution becomes clear when we compare the ages of ngc6397 and 47tuc determined by @xcite ( 11.70gyr and 9.90gyr ) , with those obtained from our best - fit isochrone models ( 12.93gyr and 10.95gyr ) .",
    "our absolute ages for both clusters are higher and , the age difference between ngc6397 and 47tuc is 1.98@xmath0gyr . this difference is consistent with that determined by @xcite of 2.0@xmath680.5gyr . however ,",
    "if we wanted to consider the distance modulus and reddening of the main sequence , the absolute age of each cluster would change to 12.48gyr ( ngc6397 ) and 11.31gyr ( 47tuc ) , and the age deficit ( 1.17@xmath101gyr ) would be different than that by @xcite .    also , the absolute ages we determined are consistent with the formation epochs of metal - poor and metal - rich globular clusters determined by @xcite .",
    "they inferred a mean formation epoch of globular clusters of 11.5@xmath102gyr for the metal - rich and , 12.2@xmath103gyr , for the metal - poor , if they all accreted from satellites , and 12.8@xmath104gyr , if they are all formed within the main host galaxy . when they apply a similar method to the milky way they find 10.7gyr for the metal - rich and 12.5 - 12.8gyr for the metal - poor depending on whether they formed in accreted satellites or within the main host galaxy .",
    "additionally , @xcite derived an average of old globular clusters as 13.00@xmath680.2gyr through cosmological simulations , which , again , is consistent with the age we determine for ngc6397 .    even though the red offset problem does not interfere in the fitting  because we keep the reddening as a fixed parameter",
    " the models that best fit the data still face the red offset problem , i.e. , change in the slope of white dwarf cooling sequence after m@xmath105 , that shows a trend for the models to be bluer than the data , indicating that the construction of models of white dwarf stars still have significant aspects that must be addressed in the future .",
    "the red offset problem is possibly related to partial mixing of h and he in the atmosphere of white dwarf stars and/or the lack of a better physical description of the collision - induced absorption . by running some tests in our models",
    ", we notice that the effect of a very small mixing of hydrogen and helium in the atmosphere of the ultra - cool white dwarf stars correct the slope of the models .",
    "however this still is an ongoing investigation .",
    "also , the red offset is in the same direction as that of mismatches observed when isochrone models are compared to the coolest main sequence stars , indicating that this might be a common problem for stars with very low temperatures , i. e. , opacities for the coolest stars . also , there are no models calculated with the newest collision - induced absorption opacities @xcite , so it is still and open question if they will help to solve the red offset problem .    we determined a very high value of @xmath18 for 47tuc , i.e. , a bottom heavy present day local mass function in that portion of the cluster .",
    "@xcite explained the lack of massive white dwarf stars near the centre of 47tuc by the diffusion due to gravitational relaxation .",

    "we find an @xmath18 consistent with a top - heavy type , in line with the analysis by @xcite and references therein .",
    "another important feature highlighted in our analysis is the crystallisation peak , that is clearly visible in both , the data and the model , for ngc6397 at f606w@xmath528 , is not prominent for 47tuc . for this cluster , neither the models nor the data present a clear crystallisation peak .",
