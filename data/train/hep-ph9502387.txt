    "the nature of the finite temperature electroweak phase transition remains an important and elusive problem in particle physics .",
    "the possibility of electroweak scale baryogenesis , which has helped generate new interest in this subject @xcite , requires the transition to be strongly first order ; only then does the universe depart from thermal equilibrium , satisfying the third of sakharov s requirements for baryogenesis and avoiding the washing out of any generated baryon asymmetry .",
    "this paper investigates the electroweak phase transition when the symmetry - breaking sector involves strong interactions , such as technicolor .",
    "we use an effective scalar theory to describe these interactions , and find that the transition is first order if this sector exhibits a @xmath0 global symmetry .",
    "when the interactions are relatively strong , the transition is strongly first order : the discontinuity in the order parameter at the critical temperature is of the order of the zero temperature expectation value @xmath1 .    to set the stage , we briefly review what is known about the electroweak phase transition in the minimal standard model .",
    "a variety of studies of the finite temperature effective potential have addressed this problem , using methods including the @xmath2 expansion , wilson - effective - action and `` average action '' renormalization group techniques , or graphical summation schemes with names such as daisy and superdaisy @xcite .",
    "they allow improved treatments of the infrared problems @xcite that can arise near phase transitions .",
    "the transition appears to be first order when the higgs boson is lighter than the @xmath3 and @xmath4 , but at most rather weakly so for an experimentally acceptable higgs boson mass . as that mass increases",
    ", corresponding to stronger scalar coupling , the strength of the transition decreases @xcite .",
    "when the higgs boson is much heavier than the @xmath3 and @xmath4 , it is reasonable to neglect the gauge and yukawa interactions when studying the transition . in that approximation",
    "the minimal standard model is the @xmath5 linear sigma model , and the chiral transition in @xmath6 models seems to be second order or at most weakly first order @xcite .    beyond the minimal standard model , less",
    "is known about the nature of the electroweak phase transition , especially if the symmetry - breaking sector is strongly interacting , as in a technicolor theory .",
    "lattice studies @xcite of qcd - like gauge theories indicate that with two light fermions , corresponding to an @xmath7 global symmetry , the transition is second order , whereas with more light fermions and a larger global symmetry , the transition is first order .",
    "this suggests that technicolor theories , which often do have more than two technifermions , might lead to a first order transition . to complement the lattice results , we analyze the strongly coupled symmetry - breaking problem using an effective scalar theory , which is partly amenable to analytic treatment and avoids some of the uncertainties associated with lattice techniques",
    "the properties of the phase transition depend on the dynamics of the electroweak order parameter .",
    "we assign it to transform under a global @xmath0 chiral symmetry , motivated by technicolor theories , in which the order parameter is a condensate of fermion bilinears .",
    "a one family technicolor model for example corresponds to @xmath8 flavors , large enough to suggest utility of the large @xmath9 expansion in the analysis .",
    "the most economical effective scalar theory of electroweak interactions is of course the nonlinear chiral lagrangian . to allow for the existence of a phase transition above which the order parameter vanishes , however",
    ", we must go beyond the nonlinear theory @xcite . accordingly",

    "since effective three - dimensional theories apply to finite temperature only by assuming decoupling of nonstatic modes ( discussed below ) , they are limited to the second order or very weakly first order cases . the same is true of analyses of the transition strength using renormalization group flow `` time '' @xcite .",

    "we can obtain the finite temperature effective potential as the sum of one - particle - irreducible vacuum graphs in a background field @xcite .",
    "for the linear sigma model of interest here , the calculation is conveniently implemented using the auxiliary field method @xcite to eliminate the @xmath47 interaction in favor of a nonpropagating dimension - two field @xmath60 .",
    "the auxiliary field facilitates resummation to all orders in @xmath47 , at each order in @xmath35 .",
    "it consists of adding to the lagrangian a perfect square , which yields an irrelevant constant factor upon path integration over the auxiliary field : @xmath61    before presenting results for the full theory , it is useful to review the nature of the phase transition in the @xmath42 theory ( @xmath44 symmetry ) .",
    "analyses using the @xmath35 expansion show that the high temperature phase transition here is second order @xcite .",

    "( [ sigmalagrangian ] ) with @xmath42 gives a first order result @xcite .",

    "( [ sigmalagrangian ] ) and solving a momentum - independent schwinger  dyson equation for the nambu ",
    "goldstone boson effective mass , whose solution is inserted into the single loop of nambu  goldstone bosons .",
    "the effective potential computed in this way becomes complex for @xmath66 between the symmetry - breaking minimum ( where the nambu  goldstone boson mass vanishes ) and the origin .",
    "this occurs for @xmath68 as well ; in either case , the imaginary part may be interpreted @xcite as the transition amplitude for leaving an unstable configuration , into which a classical external source can not force the system .",
    "one may define a real quantity by a maxwell construction : the `` convex effective potential '' ( the convex envelope of the real part of the above effective potential ) @xcite .",
    "although the convex effective potential approximately describes the lowest energy quantum state for a given @xmath66 , if a local minimum remains at the origin then the system is likely to supercool , remaining in the quantum state peaked at @xmath69 even below the temperature @xmath70 where the symmetry - breaking minimum falls to a lower energy than the symmetric one @xcite .",
    "the phase transition is thus controlled by the appearance and location of minima in the nonconvex potential as computed here .",
    "turning now to the general case with @xmath68 , the computation is complicated by the fact that planar graphs to all orders in @xmath24 contribute at leading order in the @xmath35 expansion .",
    "auxiliary fields could also be introduced to replace the @xmath24 interaction , but not very usefully since an infinite class of graphs would still contribute at each order in @xmath35 .",
