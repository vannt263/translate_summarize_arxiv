    "the superscaling behavior of the nuclear inclusive semi - leptonic electroweak response in the quasielastic ( qe ) region has been seen to be a useful concept , as illustrated and discussed in recent work  @xcite .",
    "superscaling stands for scaling both in the three - momentum @xmath0 transferred from the probe to the nucleus ( scaling of the first kind , often referred to as @xmath1-scaling ) and in a momentum that is characteristic of a given nucleus ( scaling of the second kind ) .",
    "the latter characteristic parameter is often taken for simplicity to be the fermi momentum @xmath2 , and hence equivalently scaling of the second kind is related to the density ( @xmath3 ) of a given nuclear species .",
    "of course , the choice of @xmath2 as a scaling variable arises naturally in the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model which was used initially in ref .",
    "@xcite to motivate the introduction of the concept of superscaling .    in particular , in studies of scaling the inclusive cross sections ( or , if available ,",
    "the individual separated responses ) are first divided by an appropriate single - nucleon cross section .",
    "for example , in electron scattering from a nucleus with charge and neutron numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , the dividing factor has the form @xmath6 . for scaling of the first kind",
    "one displays this reduced cross section against an appropriately chosen scaling variable , such as the familiar @xmath1 variable or a dimensionless analog called @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 if a phenomenological energy shift is included ; see the discussions in the next section for details ) , and in some kinematic regimes observes a universality of the results with respect to the choice of momentum transfer .",
    "that is , the result scales .",
    "specifically one finds that this behavior occurs when the momentum transfer is sufficiently large ( typically larger than about 500 - 700 mev / c ) and only when the energy transfer is lower than the value that characterizes the position of the quasielastic peak ( qep ) , the so - called scaling region . in contrast , as emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite and also in refs .",
    "@xcite , scaling of the second kind proceeds from the same reduced cross section , but now ( 1 ) makes the reduced cross section or scaling function dimensionless by multiplying it by the characteristic nuclear momentum scale ( called @xmath2 henceforth ) and ( 2 ) displays this as a function of a dimensionless scaling variable , again scaled by division by @xmath2 . in the scaling region one finds universality for different nuclear species at given kinematics . when both types of scaling occur",
    "one says that the response superscales .",
    "in fact , only the longitudinal part of the response appears to superscale ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and also @xcite ) , and even in the scaling region one finds some degree of scaling violation which appears to arise in the transverse part of the response .",
    "thus the longitudinal contributions , apparently being essentially impulsive at high energies , are usually used to determine the basic nuclear physics of quasielastic scattering .",
    "this leaves us with the transverse contributions to explain . in the region above the qep it is natural to have scaling violations , since the reaction mechanism there is not solely impulsive knockout of protons and neutrons , but may proceed via meson production including via baryon resonances such as the @xmath9 .",
    "one knows that these contributions are much more prominent in the tranverse response that in the longitudinal contributions and hence it is reasonable to expect some of the scaling violations to arise this way . but",
    "this is not the entire story : even below meson production threshold there are scaling violations in the transverse response .",
    "one source for this is expected to be the role played by the meson - exchange current ( mec ) contributions , which again are predominantly transverse ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and this has motivated the present study .",
    "the correlation and mec contributions to quasielastic and @xmath9-region electron scattering have been the subject of many studies ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . in this work",
    "we shall present a first exploration of the impact of the two  particle  two  hole ( 2p-2h ) excitations induced by the mec on the superscaling behavior of the transverse rfg response . in the present work we limit the scope to mec contributions mediated by pion exchange and include contributions both from intermediate nucleons and also @xmath9 isobars .",
    "our results are compared with the relevant data to assess the role of such mec effects in explaining the scale breaking .    in carrying out this task",
    "we take advantage of a very recent calculation of the 2p-2h mec contribution to the rfg transverse response performed fully respecting lorentz and translational invariance @xcite .",
    "the same type of analysis of the rfg response has also been carried out in the 1p-1h sector , for both the longitudinal and transverse channels , in a scheme that is not only lorentz and translational , but gauge invariant as well @xcite . in order to fulfill gauge invariance also in the 2p-2h sector of the rfg hilbert space , an extension to include 2p-2h excitations induced by correlations , in addition to the mec ,",
    "is required .",
    "this topic is currently under investigation .    in the present paper",
    "we start by briefly outlining in sect .",
    "[ sec : form ] the formalism that lies at the basis of our study .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "[ sec : psi<0 ] , we explore the kinematical domain to the left of the qep ( that is , @xmath10 ) , which is dominated , for @xmath11 , by 1p-1h excitations .",
    "past investigations  @xcite have convincingly demonstrated that for @xmath10 second - kind scaling is quite well satisfied : indeed , the data scale almost perfectly in @xmath2 if the latter is appropriately chosen . also , at least at sufficiently large values of @xmath12 , scaling of the first kind appears quite well obeyed by nature for @xmath10 , although not as well as scaling of the second kind .    in this work",
    "we observe an important contribution of 2p-2h mec in the kinematical region lying below @xmath13 , where the rfg 1p-1h processes are forbidden . in the region nearer the qep where the rfg 1p-1h contributions enter for the transverse scaling function one has , on the one hand , both the 1p-1h mec and correlation contributions  @xcite which conspire and interfere with the impulsive contributions ( the basic rfg responses ) to yield a net transverse response that is reduced with respect to the rfg . on the other hand ,",
    "the 2p-2h mec contributions add incoherently and tend to compensate the above reduction .",
    "see also refs .",
    "note that both classes of contributions provide scaling violations .",
    "after exploring the scaling region and the region of the qep , in sect .",
    "[ sec : psi>0 ] we extend our study to the domain @xmath14 , focusing on the impact of the 2p-2h excitations on scaling in the resonance region . here",
    "first - kind scaling is well - known to be very badly violated , owing to the role now played by nucleon excitations and meson production , which , as stated above , are largely transverse . on the other hand , in ref .  @xcite it is shown that violations of the transverse second - kind scaling behavior are not so large , although they can be as large as 20% in the resonance region .",
    "again we emphasize that in the present work longitudinal scaling is always assumed to be perfect .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : delta ] we explore the role of the @xmath9 in the 2p-2h mec contributions relative to effects arising from two - body currents that contain only nucleons and pions .",
    "some flexibility exists in modeling the former via the effective lagrangian used in the present work and we present results displaying the impact of changing the parameters in the model .",
    "clearly , part of the story is contained in the present work where the 2p-2h mec and their impact on the two kinds of scaling is explored ; however , naturally the complete story will have to await the ultimate extensions to larger classes of mec and correlation effects which are presently being pursued . in the conclusions we address this issue of what is still missing in our analysis of superscaling and",
    "indicate what is being done to complete the ( highly non - trivial ) study .",
    "we also briefly summarize our present findings and comment on their significance and on future perspectives .",
    "in this section we summarize the basic formulas needed in our analysis of the superscaling physics , closely following refs .",
    "as is well - known , the inclusive cross section for the scattering of electrons from nuclei in the one - photon exchange approximation reads @xmath15 , \\label{xsec}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the mott cross section and @xmath17 is the four - momentum transferred by the virtual photon , with @xmath18 its energy transfer , @xmath19 its three - momentum transfer and @xmath20 .",
    "equivalently we may use the dimensionless variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the nucleon mass .",

    "any independent pair of quantities may be used as kinematics variables , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc .",
    ", as these are all functionally related . in studies of qe scaling the last choice proves useful and in this work we continue to employ this pair . moreover , one finds that a small phenomenological energy shift improves the modeling and accordingly we shift @xmath42 and correspondingly @xmath43 and , by substitution of @xmath44 for @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) , likewise a shifted scaling variable @xmath8 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 . also in the same model a small correction ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49,\\ ] ] expresses ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : glt ] ) ) the impact of the medium on the single - nucleon electromagnetic cross section  @xcite",
    ". as far as the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton and the neutron @xmath50,@xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are concerned , we adopt the hhler parametrization of ref .  @xcite .    the scaling variables @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath54 have been discussed in detail in previous work . in particular ,",
    "the familiar @xmath1 variable has been motivated using the impulsive knockout of nucleons from the nucleus as a starting point ( see , for example , ref .",
    "one identifies the allowed region of missing energy and missing momentum for given @xmath12 and @xmath18 , finding that in the so - called scaling region the lowest possible value of the missing momentum , where the knockout cross section is expected to peak , occurs at @xmath55 .",
    "one then argues that at large momentum transfers the integral of the nuclear spectral function over this kinematic region ( _ i.e. , _ the inclusive cross section insofar as it is dominated by nucleon knockout ) asymptotes to a function that depends only on @xmath1 , but not on @xmath12 , and hence contains scaling of the first kind .",
    "alternatively , the rfg model naturally yields a scaling variable , as discussed above .",
    "in fact , in this latter case it not only naturally leads to scaling of the first kind , but , as stated above , also produces a result that is independent of nuclear species , namely , scaling of the second kind .",
    "this was first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite where the concept of superscaling was introduced . in fact , for typical circumstances involving all but the lightest nuclei , the various scaling variables are closely related ; the inter - relationships have been explored in depth in ref .",
    "@xcite and the reader is directed to that paper for more detail .    to summarize , scaling of the first kind means that the function @xmath29 loses its dependence upon @xmath56 for large enough values of @xmath56 and naturally occurs in several models .",
    "to get rid as well of the dependence upon the momentum scale set by the nuclear structure itself , namely the fermi momentum @xmath2 , it is convenient to do as discussed in the introduction and introduce a new dimensionless scaling function @xmath57 according to @xmath58 for the rfg one gets @xmath59 namely , perfect superscaling .",

    "@xcite the net effect on the scaling behavior of these contributions was explored ( see especially fig .",
    "7 of that reference ) and , as here , scaling violations of both first and second kinds were predicted .",
    "the interference between the one - body rfg contributions and these additional 1p-1h contributions reduces the cross section , typically by 1015% in the qep region for momentum transfers in the few gev / c range , although there is a tendency towards restoration of scaling as @xmath12 exceeds values around 2 gev / c or so . at the values of @xmath12 of interest in the present work",
    "scaling of the second - kind is broken roughly proportionally to @xmath105 and hence is relatively unimportant for very light nuclei , if not for medium - weight ones . for example , in going from carbon to gold ( see below ) at @xmath106 gev / c one finds a second - kind scale breaking of about 8% ( see  @xcite ) .    in fig .",

    "]    let us next discuss the _ second - kind scaling _",
    "behavior seen at large negative @xmath8 . in fact , as the above figures show , the only cases where both carbon and gold data extend down to this region are those for @xmath127 and @xmath114 .",
    "accordingly , in fig .  [ fig : caujlab2330le0 ] the jlab data for @xmath127 ( panel a ) and @xmath114 ( panel b ) are separated out from fig .",
    "[ fig : caujlable0 ] and again compared with @xmath95 , but now simultaneously for carbon ( crosses and solid curve ) and gold ( circles and dashed curve ) .",
    "starting with the @xmath113 case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : caujlab2330le0]a , one observes the following : at the qep @xmath140 one finds that @xmath95 is about 13% of the experimental @xmath99 and that the second - kind scaling violation implied by the difference between the curves for carbon and gold amounts to about 4% .",
    "as already noted above , the results shown here do not take into account the 1p-1h mec + correlation contributions which decrease the overall non - impulse - approximation effect , making these numbers over - estimates .",
    "both classes of contributions go roughly as @xmath105 at high @xmath12 and so the partial cancellation is relatively independent of the actual species of nuclei being examined .",
    "in contrast , at large negative @xmath8 the only scale - breaking contributions in the present model are those provided by the 2p-2h mec terms and , in fact , on the one hand we see that they can have relatively large effects when compared with the full experimental scaling function  for instance , at @xmath100 one finds that @xmath95 is about 16% of the experimental @xmath99 . on the other hand , the second - kind scaling violation implied by the difference between the curves for carbon and gold amounts to about 7% for these kinematics , interestingly with the gold curve lying below that for carbon , in contrast to the behavior above @xmath141 where the reverse is true .",
    "thus , for the high-@xmath12 , large - negative-@xmath8 region covered by the @xmath113 data for carbon and gold one sees some violation of scaling of the second kind , although such mec effects alone appear not to destroy the excellent scaling seen in the existing data .",
    "indeed , slight adjustments in the choices of @xmath2 and @xmath142 can be made ( these are , after all , empirically determined  @xcite ) and thereby can also provide changes of this size . however , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : caujlab2330le0]b where results at @xmath114 and hence large @xmath12 are shown , it does not take too much for the mec effects , including the amount of second - kind scale breaking they provide , to become significant .",
    "unfortunately , as noted above , the gold data do not extend down to very low values of @xmath8 for these conditions and so it is not presently possible to see clear evidence for such contributions .",
    "finally , we note that for intermediate negative values of @xmath8 the net degree of second - kind scale - breaking is expected to be only a few percent and clearly compatible with what is seen in the data .",
    "in the region @xmath143 at sufficiently high @xmath12 baryon resonances , meson production and eventually deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) make significant , even dominant , contributions to the total response .",
    "this regime has recently been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite in which an _",
    "inelastic _ version of the basic rfg approach , together with an extension called the erfg , were studied ( the reader is directed to the cited reference for details ) .",
    "additionally , here we also have contributions from @xmath95 .     as for fig .",
    "[ fig : psikfle0 ] , but now for the region above the qep . ]    to explore how @xmath95 may or may not violate second - kind scaling in the domain @xmath143 , as in the previous section we begin by showing results versus @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : psikfgt0 ] at @xmath144 and 2 . here",
    "it is quite apparent that the 2p-2h mec excitations alone substantially break the second - kind scaling .",
    "for example , at @xmath144 in going from @xmath110c to @xmath111au there is roughly a 20% increase in @xmath95 at @xmath145  gev / c and a 35% increase at @xmath146  gev / c .     as for fig .",

    "when @xmath8 is positive , we display @xmath95 together with @xmath148 in fig .",
    "[ fig : causlacgt0 ] ( where the slac data are also shown ) and in fig .",
    "[ fig : caujlabgt0 ] ( where the jlab data are displayed ) , again for @xmath110c and @xmath111au . in the figures",
    "it is seen that @xmath95 is significant around @xmath144 , accounting for roughly 1020% of the data for @xmath12 below 2  gev / c , down to a few percent at the highest momenta .",
    "note that the trend is in the right direction : the heavier nucleus ( larger @xmath2 ) has a larger 2p-2h mec contribution than does the lighter one , in concert with what is observed in the data .",
    "putting these two pieces of information together we see that the degree of second - kind scaling violation that arises from the 2p-2h mec contributions obtained in the present work is a few percent at modest @xmath12 , dropping to the sub - one - percent level at higher @xmath12 .",
    "this is smaller than the amount found in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely that in the domain @xmath143 second - kind scaling in the total scaling function @xmath99 is violated at about the 20% level .",
    "there it was observed that the inelasticity mentioned above itself violates scaling of the second kind and clearly dominates the total inclusive cross section . the follow - up study in ref .",
    "@xcite makes this point even clearer ( see , for example , fig .",
    "12 in that reference where the @xmath132 slac data also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : causlacgt0 ] are compared with the inelastic rfg and erfg model results ) .",
    "thus , at least at the point reached in addressing the nature of the inclusive cross section in the region above the qep , we find that , while the 2p-2h mec effects can be important at modest values of @xmath12 , they do not apparently break the second - kind scaling behavior by more than a few percent and that the actual scale - breaking observed comes from other effects .",
    "a final thing to note is that the 2p-2h mec contributions violate first - kind scaling in the opposite direction to the trend displayed by the data , since one observes a decreasing of @xmath95 with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "this is also opposite to the behavior seen in the scale - breaking seen in the inelastic modeling reported in ref .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively . as we shall see",
    ", this comes about through a rather delicate cancellation , and accordingly we shall explore in a bit more depth two aspects of these issues . on the one hand , we wish to investigate the sensitivity of the contributions made by the @xmath9-current to the 2p-2h excitations with respect to variations of the poorest - known parameter entering into the definition of the @xmath9-current itself , namely , the cutoff in the hadronic form factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffd ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we wish to gauge the relative role played by the @xmath9 via comparisons of the 2p-2h mec contribution computed using the whole set of mec in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jmec ] ) with those arising from the @xmath9 alone .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cslacd ] the basic rfg scaling function and @xmath95 are displayed , together with the slac data taken at @xmath132 ( panel a ) and @xmath130 ( panel b ) , versus @xmath8 for @xmath110c .",
    "the 2p-2h mec scaling function is computed in the full model and with the @xmath9 alone , in the latter case in three different versions , corresponding to three values of the cutoff in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffd ] ) , namely @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159  mev .",
    "the same analysis is carried out for @xmath111au and presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : aujlabd ] , now with the jlab data at @xmath112 ( panel a ) and @xmath160 ( panel b ) .",
    "interesting features emerge from the two figures .",
    "first , concerning @xmath110c , we recall the discussions of kinematics made earlier : in panel ( a ) one has @xmath161  gev / c , whereas in panel ( b ) one has @xmath162  gev / c . for these ranges of three - momentum transfer",
    "it is observed that within the fermi cone the non-@xmath9 terms ( those arising from diagrams having only nucleons and pions ) play quite a minor role , almost insignificant at small @xmath12 , and that the harder the @xmath149 vertex , the larger the @xmath9 contribution .",
    "in contrast , in the scaling region ( @xmath163 ) , it turns out that the @xmath9 by itself yields a contribution that is substantially larger than the one found with the full mec and that this becomes more pronounced as @xmath12 grows .",
    "this behavior , in fact , stems from the interferences between the @xmath9 and non-@xmath9 contributions which are of opposite sign  @xcite .",
    "that is , we see that the non-@xmath9 currents , while giving rise to small contributions in themselves , actually open the door to significant interference effects .",
    "this is emphasized in fig .",
    "[ fig : aujlabd ] , where the mec are probed at substantially larger momenta , namely @xmath164  gev / c in panel ( b ) .",
    "the concept of scaling is based on having some basic `` elementary '' cross section for scattering from the constituents in a system which can reasonably be factored out , leaving a reduced cross section whose nature is determined essentially by the distribution of the constituents . given that a decomposition of this sort is indeed reasonable , that is , that a factorization of this type occurs at least for the dominant contributions in the cross section ( coherent scatterings , for example , would not tend to have such a property ) , it is often the case that the reduced cross section is in fact a relatively universal function of one or more scaling variables , namely , that the results scale and one has a very compact representation of the cross section @xcite .",
    "this is certainly true when the constituents of the system are `` simple '' or behave as such , as happens for the partons in the nucleon ( asymptotic freedom ) or for the electrons in an atom at appropriate energies .",
    "however , it can remain true even when the constituents are complex , as for atoms in solids and , as the studies discussed in the present work indicate , for nuclei at high @xmath12 and excitations spanning a wide range from below the quasielastic peak through the resonance region and into the regime where dis is beginning to become applicable . on the other hand",
    ", it is certainly not a valid way to proceed in all circumstances ; for instance , very near threshold in electroexcitation one has collectivity and the factorization is clearly broken .    even in the kinematical region where the dominant contribution appears to scale",
    ", one knows that other processes can also play some role and therefore that several questions arise .",
    "do such additional contributions show either first- or second - kind scaling behaviors or not ? if not , are they sizable contributions relative to the dominant ( scaling ) processes , and therefore , if they do not scale , is the modeling in conflict with observation or not ? or , said another way , how much scaling violation is to be expected from these additional contributions ?    in the present context , where we are focusing on the scaling , qep and resonance regions for inclusive electron scattering at high @xmath12 , one can think of several physical processes of this type that might provide some degree of scale - breaking beyond the basic impulsive process ( the rfg model in the present work ) which does have the scaling properties .",
    "in particular , we know from work already done  @xcite that mec effects and correlations in the 1p-1h sector do not in general have scaling of either the first or second kind , although the degree of scale - breaking is relatively small under most circumstances . moreover , in the resonance region and beyond we know that inelastic , but impulsive scattering from nucleons in the nucleus also breaks both kinds of scaling  @xcite , and in a way that tends to improve the agreement with the data ( which also do not scale in that region ) .    still other effects remain to be explored . in particular",
    ", it would be highly desirable to have relativistic treatments of correlation effects not just for the 1p-1h sector alluded to above , but also in the 2p-2h sector , since these are known to be sizable at least in non - relativistic calculations at low momenta  @xcite ; one would like relativistic modeling of short - range nn correlations as well , as they are expected to contribute especially in the large - negative-@xmath8 region  @xcite ; furthermore , additional many - body interaction effects ( such as via rpa correlations ) may play a role ; and nuclear binding effects arising , for example , in a relativized shell model approach should also be explored .",
    "most of these are presently being revisited in a relativistic context in other on - going work .    in the present work we have considered one other specific process which naturally does not scale , namely , the effects arising from 2p-2h mec contributions .",
    "we employ currents arising both from diagrams containing the @xmath9 and those built only from nucleons and pions ( non-@xmath9 terms ) , and in a brief section present results to show the delicate interplay between these two classes of diagrams and to indicate the cutoff - dependence in the former .",
    "our present studies are based on recent work  @xcite where these pieces of the cross section were derived and comparisons were made with other existing studies .",
    "our motivation for the present work is a specific one : here we have focused on the scaling properties of the 2p-2h mec contributions .",
    "results are presented for kinematics ranging from far below the qep ( at large negative @xmath8 ) , in the region of the qep ( near @xmath102 ) and beyond ( at positive @xmath8 ) where resonances and dis can both play significant roles .",
    "we have found that scaling of both the first and second kinds is generally broken by these contributions .    at negative @xmath8",
    "we find potentially large contributions from 2p-2h mec effects  these may be comparable to the total response at very large negative @xmath8 and amount typically to about 10% at @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath8 is very negative we have seen a stabilization with increasing @xmath12 at fixed @xmath8 set in , so that at very high values of @xmath12 the first - kind scaling behavior appears to be recovered . on the other hand , also at large negative @xmath8 , we see violations of second - kind scaling that are compatible with the existing data in this region ; however , the results obtained here suggest that , were data on several nuclei to become available at still higher values of @xmath12 , one might begin to see significant second - kind scaling violations .    in the vicinity of the qep ( @xmath165 ) we have continued to see a delicate interplay between the mec+correlation effects in the 1p-1h sector and the present 2p-2h mec effects  the former interfere with the impulsive rfg response and lead to a decrease in the net 1p-1h result , typically by about 10% , whereas the 2p-2h mec effects go in the opposite direction by roughly the same amount .",
    "the net result , at least when 1-body , 1p-1h ( mec+correlation ) and 2p-2h ( mec only ) contributions are taken into account , is a tendency to restore the final total answer back to where one began .",
    "one should be cautious , however , in drawing conclusions that are too strong at this point , since relativistic 2p-2h correlation contributions are as yet not available .    in the large - positive-@xmath8 region",
    "we find that the second - kind scaling is again violated , but not by very much compared with the data .",
    "indeed , it is clear from previous work that the main scaling violations in this regime stem from the inelastic , but impulsive excitations .",
    "this is not to say that the 2p-2h mec contributions are insignificant  they account for perhaps 1020% of the total strength in the resonance region  just that they appear to provide only few percent violations of second - kind scaling .",
    "interestingly , in this region the first - kind scaling is also violated by the 2p-2h mec contributions , but with a trend that is opposite to what is observed in the data and also in the inelastic modeling . in summary , in the resonance region we find that the net result is typically about 8090% from inelastic 1-body contributions ( _ i.e. , _ in the extended rfg model of @xcite ) , to which must be added the roughly 1020% from 2p-2h mec effects .",
