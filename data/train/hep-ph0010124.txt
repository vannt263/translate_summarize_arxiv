    "recent superkamiokande experiments on atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite have presented very convincing evidence for the oscillation of @xmath2 to @xmath3 with a mass difference @xmath4  ev@xmath5 .",
    "if neutrinos are indeed massive , the seesaw mechanism  @xcite is the most natural framework to account for the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "we point out , in this paper , that the seesaw - induced mass terms for neutrinos generate instability of the vacuum in the supersymmetric(susy ) standard model , if the anomaly mediation  @xcite of susy breaking provides the dominant contribution to all the susy - standard - model fields .",
    "the transition of our false vacuum to the true vacuum is strongly suppressed at zero temperature , since the true minimum is separated far away from our false vacuum .",
    "however , the thermal transition seems to be effective at high temperatures because of the thermal excitations , which may lead to horrible universes .",
    "we find , contrary to the above thought , that the thermal transition is also strongly suppressed and hence the anomaly mediation models are perfectly consistent with the present observation .",
    "therefore , the reheating temperature after inflation would not be constrained from above in anomaly mediation models with the seesaw - induced mass terms for neutrinos .",
    "this our observation makes the anomaly mediation models very attractive , since most of baryo & lepto - genesis models need sufficiently high temperature @xmath6  gev  @xcite .",
    "notice that the anomaly mediation models predict the large gravitino mass @xmath7  tev avoiding the `` gravitino problem '' , which is a serious problem in gravity - mediation models  @xcite .",
    "in the anomaly mediation models the susy breaking in the hidden sector is transmitted to the observed sector by super - weyl anomaly effects  @xcite . in particular , the anomaly effects provide the dominant contribution to gaugino masses as @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the gauge coupling constants for @xmath10 and @xmath11 gauge groups , and @xmath12 are @xmath13-function coefficients of the corresponding gauge coupling constants .",
    "@xmath14 is the supergravity auxiliary supermultiplet whose @xmath15 component s vacuum - expectation value ( vev ) is of order the gravitino mass @xmath16 .",
    "it is very crucial in the present analysis that the gaugino masses are one - loop suppressed relative to the gravitino mass and hence the gravitino is extremely heavy . for the gluino mass @xmath17",
    "tev we see the gravitino mass @xmath18  tev .",
    "the susy - breaking ( mass)@xmath5 for scalar bosons are induced at the two - loop level . however , pure anomaly mediation predicts slepton ( mass)@xmath5 to be negative , requiring additional contributions to the slepton masses . in the present analysis",
    "we employ the simple phenomenological solution  @xcite to this problem that merely adds a universal mass term @xmath19 of order the electroweak scale ( 100  gev  1  tev)@xmath5 to all of the scalar masses , leaving the gaugino and gravitino masses unchanged .",
    "we assume , in this paper , the gravitino mass @xmath20  tev .",
    "let us now discuss the seesaw - induced mass terms for neutrinos .",
    "the integration of heavy right - handed neutrinos generates the following non - renormalizable operator in the low - energy superpotential : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are chiral supermultiplets for lepton and higgs doublets and @xmath24 denotes family index .",
    "@xmath25 represent the effective majorana masses for right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we take , in the present analysis , @xmath26  gev , reproducing @xmath27  ev suggested from the superkamiokande experiments on the atmospheric neutrino oscillation  @xcite .",
    "we suppress the family indices in the following discussion .",
    "we consider the following @xmath28-term flat direction : @xmath29 and others @xmath30 .",
    "then , the superpotential is written as @xmath31 the scalar potential is given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the soft susy breaking mass for @xmath34 .",
    "note that we have assumed our desired vacuum @xmath35 to have an ( almost ) vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "we easily see that the desired minimum @xmath36 is no longer the absolute minimum in the theory of anomaly mediation with @xmath37 much larger than @xmath38 .",
    "the true vacuum appears at  gev there . ] @xmath39 and it has a negative cosmological constant given by    @xmath40    since the potential energy @xmath41 of the present universe is much higher than @xmath42 , we live in the false vacuum now flat direction is lifted up in some extended models by introducing new particles at intermediate energy scales . in those cases ,",
    "the true vacuum with a large negative cosmological constant may not appear . ] .",
    "this false vacuum is in principle unstable against tunneling into the true vacuum .",
    "if the anomaly mediated susy breaking models really describe our world , the tunneling rate should be very small in order that the present false vacuum survives at least longer than the age of the present universe .",
    "furthermore , we must have had some certain cosmological history that has safely led us to this false vacuum .",
    "let us estimate the tunneling rate of our false vacuum . at zero temperature we must estimate four dimensional euclidean action @xmath43 evaluated with the bounce solution for the potential ( [ eq : potential ] )  @xcite . since the potential at the true minimum is deep in comparison with the height of the potential barrier [ @xmath44 ( _ i.e. _ the thick wall approximation ) [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ] . then @xmath43 is given by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48    by redefining @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being dimensionless",
    ", we can easily see that @xmath43 is rewritten as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "then we obtain the tunneling rate @xmath55 as    @xmath56    since @xmath57 , the tunneling rate @xmath55 is negligibly small and hence the vacuum transition into the true vacuum is sufficiently suppressed at zero temperature .",
    "we can see that this stability against the tunneling comes from the smallness of the coefficient @xmath58 of the quartic term ( @xmath59 ) in the potential ( [ eq : def - lambda ] ) .",
    "indeed the exponent is roughly estimated as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and hence @xmath62 the small coefficient has led to the large expectation value @xmath63 and the large potential barrier compared with the mass @xmath64 .",
    "we have found that once the @xmath65 vacuum ( which we call @xmath66-vacuum hereafter ) was chosen and the temperature has dropped down almost to zero , the quantum tunneling to the @xmath67 vacuum ( which we call @xmath68-vacuum ) is sufficiently suppressed .",
    "now let us examine whether or not this @xmath66-vacuum is chosen naturally in the cosmological history .",
    "what can be plausibly taken to be the initial condition of the cosmological history ?",
    "we have many evidences which suggest that there exists an inflationary epoch before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "this inflationary epoch is followed by reheating process .",
    "the energy density of the universe which was initially carried by the inflaton potential energy is gradually but completely converted into thermal plasma energy through inflaton decay .    during this reheating process , the temperature of the thermal plasma changes as a function of time as@xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is hubble parameter during the reheating process , @xmath71 decay rate of the inflaton and @xmath72  gev the reduced planck mass .",
    "the universe takes the maximum temperature @xmath73 soon after inflation and this temperature is much higher than that at the end of the reheating process ( the reheating temperature @xmath74 ) . in this thermal plasma with high temperature , the @xmath34 field feels finite temperature effective potential which is drastically different from the zero temperature potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
    "now let us see this thermal effective potential in detail .",
    "particles which have interactions with the @xmath34 field give contributions to the thermal potential of the @xmath34 field .",
    "these contributions exist as long as those particles are in thermal equilibrium and therefore as long as masses of those particles are less than the temperature .",
    "the @xmath34 field expectation value @xmath75 gives masses to those particles through the superpotential , @xmath76 where @xmath77 denote up - type yukawa couplings , @xmath78 denote charged - lepton yukawa couplings , @xmath79 denote lepton - flavor mixing matrix elements , and @xmath80 is higgs supermultiplet couple to down - type quarks . @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "are given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "masses of @xmath83 and @xmath84 supermultiplet particles are @xmath85 and those of @xmath86 and @xmath87 particles are @xmath88 . hence the range of the field value in which the thermal potentials arise from those particle loops",
    "are roughly limited to @xmath89 .",
    "the contribution to the thermal potential ( @xmath90 free energy ) from each chiral multiplet is given by @xmath91 .",
    "we now assume , for example , @xmath92 . in this case , while the temperature is higher than @xmath93 , the top quark multiplet does not decouple from the thermal equilibrium even for @xmath94 ( since @xmath95 ) . and @xmath96 . ] then for all @xmath97 , the thermal mass term @xmath98 arising from top ( s)quark multiplet , where @xmath99 , is dominant over the negative quartic term which originally exists .",
    "there is no local minimum anywhere except for @xmath100 and the universe sits around the origin @xmath101 .    when the temperature drops below @xmath93 , the top ( s)quark multiplet decouples from the equilibrium for @xmath102 and this multiplet contributes to the thermal potential only for @xmath103 . while the temperature is larger than @xmath104 ( and less than @xmath93 ) , the effective mass term for @xmath105 comes from the thermal contribution of lepton , higgs and charm ( s)quark multiplets .",
    "this thermal mass term is also large enough to dominate the negative quartic term ( since @xmath106 ) and hence the @xmath101 minimum is still the only and absolute minimum .. assumption of @xmath107 is sufficient . ] after the temperature gets down below @xmath108 , lepton , higgs and charm ( s)quark supermultiplets no longer give thermal potential for @xmath109 , since the temperature is not enough to thermalize those particles with masses @xmath110 .",
    "the thermal potential by now comes only from up ( s)quark supermultiplet , which is so tiny ( since @xmath111 ) that the effective potential of the field @xmath34 begins to show a dip around the would - be true minimum @xmath112(fig.[fig : pot - ft ] ) .",
    "as the temperature falls further , this dip gets larger .",
    "the local minimum newly appeared there will become the true minimum before the temperature drops down to @xmath113(fig.[fig : pot - ft ] ) .",
    "this change in the shape of effective thermal potential is exactly the same as that in the standard first order phase transition .",
    "naive guess will tell us that the phase transition to the @xmath68-vacuum occurred in the history of the universe as usual .",
    "we study in the following whether the phase transition really occurs or not .",
    "first order phase transitions are known to take place through following two mechanisms .",
    "one mechanism is through equilibrium between @xmath66- and @xmath68-vacua  @xcite , and the other is the conventional bubble nucleation process  @xcite .    at first we study the phase transition through the thermal equilibrium between @xmath66-vacuum(@xmath114 ) and @xmath68-vacuum ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "key idea of this mechanism is as follows .",
    "once the dip in the potential is formed then domains of @xmath66-vacua and @xmath68-vacua appear .",
    "the size of each domain is roughly the correlation length ( @xmath116 curvature inverse ) of the scalar field .",
    "these two types of domains are in the thermal equilibrium via thermal transition of vacua beyond the potential barrier .",
    "the transition rate from @xmath66-vacuum to @xmath68-vacuum and vice versa are given by  @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath118 are curvature of the effective potential at each vacua , @xmath119 are free energy barrier of transition in each direction .",
    "the ratio of number of @xmath66- and @xmath68- vacua is determined by detailed balance condition if the system is in the equilibrium : @xmath120 if the system keeps equilibrium until the @xmath68-vacuum really becomes true vacuum and until the domain size becomes larger than the critical radius , then the true ( @xmath68-)vacuum domains begin to expand and percolate , and the phase transition is completed .",
    "now let us examine if the equilibrium is maintained for the case of our interest .",
    "we are going to make an estimate of the transition rate from the @xmath66- to the @xmath68-vacuum .",
    "when the dip in the potential was formed(@xmath121 ) , the barrier height of the free energy density in this transition is roughly given by @xmath122 since the typical volume of each domain is roughly @xmath123 , the barrier of the free energy is written as @xmath124 then , we obtain the transition rate as @xmath125 this transition rate is extremely small compared with the expansion rate of the universe @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that the transition between the @xmath66-vacuum and the @xmath68-vacuum is already frozen out , and hence no @xmath68-vacuum domain is created .",
    "the phase transition through the equilibrium between @xmath66- and @xmath68-vacuum does not take place in the case of our interest .",
    "even if the thermal equilibrium of two vacua are not formed , the false(@xmath66-)vacuum can decay into true ( @xmath68-)one , after the potential energy of the @xmath68-vacuum becomes lower than that of the @xmath66-one , through the thermal bubble nucleation .",
    "we estimate the thermal transition rate below . in the case of finite temperature ,",
    "the transition rate is determined by three dimensional euclidean action @xmath127@xcite which is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the finite temperature potential and @xmath47 satisfies @xmath130    in the same way as @xmath43 , @xmath127 is calculated with use of the dimensionless quantities [ @xmath131 as @xmath132 where @xmath133 @xmath134  @xcite .",
    "then the transition rate with temperature @xmath135 is estimated as @xmath136 as mentioned before , the @xmath68-vacuum becomes really true vacuum after the temperature cools down to @xmath137  gev . at that time",
    ", @xmath138 is already @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , the exponent is bounded from below as @xmath140 for @xmath141  gev .",
    "now let us calculate the fraction @xmath142 in the present universe which remains in the @xmath66-vacuum state .",
    "assuming that the @xmath68-vacuum bubble produced in the transition expands at the light velocity , we obtain @xmath142  @xcite , @xmath143,\\ ] ] where @xmath144 is the initial time .",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that the critical temperature below which the @xmath68-bubbles are formed is lower than the reheating temperature , or in other words , the thermal bubble nucleation occurs in the radiation dominated universe .",
    "then , @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the temperature and hubble parameter in the present universe , respectively .",
    "since the transition rate @xmath148 decreases rapidly as the temperature falls , the time integration in the eq.([eq : fraction ] ) can be replaced by @xmath149 where the @xmath150 is the initial temperature @xmath151 .",
    "the total expression of the eq.([eq : fraction ] ) is @xmath152   \\nonumber \\\\          & \\sim & \\exp \\left [ - 10^{87 } \\frac{m_g}{s_3 }                      \\left(\\frac{s_3}{2 \\pi t_i}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2 } }                              \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{s_3}{t_i } \\right )            \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath142 is almost 1 if the exponent @xmath153 is larger than 200 .",
    "therefore the condition that the most of our universe is in the @xmath66-vacuum today ( _ i.e. _ @xmath154 ) requires @xmath155 , which is satisfied in the present case ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "we have studied the vacuum stability in the anomaly mediated susy breaking models with massive neutrinos .",
    "if the small masses of neutrinos are generated by the seesaw mechanism , the seesaw - induced mass terms make the present vacuum ( @xmath66-vacuum ) with an ( almost ) vanishing cosmological constant unstable and the true vacuum ( @xmath68-vacuum ) has a disastrously large negative cosmological constant .",
    "although our false vacuum has quite high energy density compared with the true vacuum , the quantum transition into the true vacuum is highly suppressed .",
    "high temperature(more than @xmath108 ) thermal plasma that is created after inflation gives effective potential of the field @xmath34 with a unique vacuum at the origin @xmath114(@xmath66-vacuum ) .",
    "as the temperature decreases the effective potential shows a new local minimum(@xmath68-vacuum ) which turns into the true minimum at @xmath157 .",
    "the phase transition to the @xmath68-vacuum is also highly suppressed both through the thermal equilibrium domain formation of both vacua and through thermal tunneling decay process .",
    "thus , we can live on a supercooled false vacuum state .",
    "since the thermal transition from the @xmath66-vacuum to the @xmath68-vacuum is negligible , it does not give any constraint on the reheating temperature after inflation .",
    "furthermore , the gravitino mass is so heavy ( @xmath158  tev ) in anomaly mediation models that gravitinos decay much earlier than the bbn and hence the model avoids the `` gravitino problem '' , which is a serious problem in gravity - mediation models .",
    "thus , the reheating temperature is not constrained from above , which is very favored by many baryogenesis scenarios .",
    "we have discussed only on the heaviest neutrino direction . for lighter neutrino directions",
    "the analyses are the same .",
    "we easily see that the potential barrier between the true minimum and our false vacuum is much higher and the tunneling into the true vacuum is much more suppressed .",
