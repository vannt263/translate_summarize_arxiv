    "with the accumulation of observational data from cosmic microwave background measurements ( cmb ) , large scale structure surveys ( lss ) , and type ia supernovae observations ( snia ) and the improvements of the data quality , the cosmological observations play a crucial role in our understanding of the universe and also in constraining the cosmological parameters .",
    "recently , the planck collaboration has released the first cosmological papers providing the highest resolution , full sky , maps of the cmb temperature anisotropies @xcite .",
    "the corresponding numerical analysis of cosmological parameters indicates the concordance cosmology in which our universe is flat and currently dominated by dark matter and dark energy @xcite .    due to the improved precision , this new planck data",
    "has constrained several cosmological parameters at few percent level .",
    "it is crucial to compare these constraints from different combinations of cosmological datasets and check whether they are in agreement with each other . in the standard flat @xmath0cdm framework ,",
    "the constraint on the hubble constant @xmath1 is significantly improved by the new planck data , namely @xmath12 @xmath7 at @xmath8 confidence level @xcite . however",
    ", this result is obviously in tension with that measured by various lower - redshift methods , such as the direct @xmath1 probe from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations of cepheid variables with @xmath13 @xmath7 @xcite or @xmath14 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "if this difference is not induced by the unknown systematics in measurements , the tension between measurements of @xmath1 could imply that the concordance cosmological model ( the flat @xmath0cdm model ) is in fact incomplete .",
    "therefore , it is very important to perform the global analysis again and extend the simple assumption to some more general cosmological models to see whether this tension could be resolved @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the @xmath0cdm to the dynamical dark energy models and explore the cosmological constraints on the equation of state of dark energy and the hubble constant from the latest cosmological data sets , including the planck and also the wmap9 data for comparison , the bao measurements from several lss surveys , the `` snls '' compilation which includes 473 supernovae reprocessed by ref.@xcite and the hst gaussian prior on the hubble constant @xmath1 given by ref.@xcite .",
    "firstly , we consider the dark energy model with a constant equation of state ( eos ) @xmath3 and find that the current data favor the model with @xmath15 at about @xmath5 confidence level .",
    "due to the strong anti - correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 , the constraint on @xmath1 is now consistent with the hst direct probe and the @xmath1 tension disappears .",
    "then we focus on the time - evolving eos ( @xmath16 ) dark energy model .",
    "we compare our numerical method provided in refs.@xcite to treat the dark energy perturbations consistently in the whole parameter space with the method given by ref.@xcite and find that the constraints on dark energy parameters with these two methods are almost identical .",
    "finally , based on our method we constrain the time - evolving eos dark energy model and find that current data still slightly favor the quintom dark energy scenario whose eos can cross the cosmological constant boundary @xmath11 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ data ] we describe the method and the latest observational data sets used in the numerical analyses ; section [ tension ] and section [ quintom ] contains our main global constraints on the eos of dark energy models and the hubble constant from the current observations .",
    "the last section [ sum ] is the conclusions .",
    "we perform a global fitting of cosmological parameters using the cosmomc package @xcite , a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) code .",
    "we assume purely adiabatic initial conditions and neglect the primordial tensor fluctuations .",
    "the basic six cosmological parameters are allowed to vary with top - hat priors : the cold dark matter energy density parameter @xmath17 $ ] , the baryon energy density parameter @xmath18 $ ] , the scalar spectral index @xmath19 $ ] , the primordial amplitude @xmath20 \\in [ 2.7 , 4.0]$ ] , the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon at decoupling to the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface @xmath21 $ ] , and the optical depth to reionization @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the pivot scale is set at @xmath23 @xmath24 .    for dark energy models with a general w(z )",
    ", we choose the popular parametrization of eos given by refs.@xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the scale factor and @xmath27 characterizes the `` running '' of eos , and set the top - hat priors @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] . for the standard @xmath0cdm model it corresponds to @xmath30 and @xmath31 . and for the model with a constant eos ( @xmath3cdm ) , it equals to taking @xmath31 .",
    "when using the global fitting strategy to constrain the cosmological parameters , it is crucial to include dark energy perturbations @xcite . in section [ perturbation ]",
    "we will discuss the method provided in refs.@xcite in detail .",
    "therefore , the most general parameter space in our analyses is : @xmath32      in our analysis , we consider the following cosmological probes : i ) power spectra of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies ; ii ) the baryon acoustic oscillation in the galaxy power spectra ; iii ) measurement of the current hubble constant ; iv ) luminosity distances of type ia supernovae .    for the planck data from the 1-year data release @xcite",
    ", we use the low-@xmath33 and high-@xmath33 cmb temperature power spectrum data from planck with the low-@xmath33 wmap9 polarization data ( planck+wp ) .",
    "we marginalize over the nuisance parameters that model the unresolved foregrounds with wide priors @xcite , and do not include the cmb lensing data from planck @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we also use the wmap9 cmb temperature and polarization power spectra @xcite in our calculations .",
    "baryon acoustic oscillations provides an efficient method for measuring the expansion history by using features in the clustering of galaxies within large scale surveys as a ruler with which to measure the distance - redshift relation .",
    "it provides a particularly robust quantity to measure @xcite .",
    "it measures not only the angular diameter distance , @xmath34 , but also the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath35 , which is powerful for studying dark energy @xcite . since the current bao data are not accurate enough for extracting the information of @xmath34 and @xmath35 separately @xcite , one can only determine an effective distance @xcite : @xmath36^{1/3}~.\\ ] ] following the planck analysis @xcite , in this paper we use the bao measurement from the 6df galaxy redshift survey ( 6dfgrs ) at a low redshift ( @xmath37 ) @xcite , and the measurement of the bao scale based on a re - analysis of the luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) sample from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 at the median redshift ( @xmath38 ) @xcite , and the bao signal from boss cmass dr9 data at ( @xmath39 ) @xcite .    in our analysis , we add a gaussian prior on the current hubble constant given by ref.@xcite ; @xmath40 @xmath7 ( 68% c.l . ) .",
    "the quoted error includes both statistical and systematic errors .",
    "this measurement of @xmath1 is obtained from the magnitude - redshift relation of 240 low - z type ia supernovae at @xmath41 by the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) camera 2 of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "this is a significant improvement over the previous prior , @xmath42 @xmath7 , which is from the hubble key project final result .",
    "in addition , we impose a weak top - hat prior on the hubble parameter : @xmath43 $ ] @xmath7 .    finally , we include data from type ia supernovae , which consists of luminosity distance measurements as a function of redshift , @xmath44 . in this paper",
    "we use the supernovae data set , `` snls '' compilation , which includes 473 supernovae reprocessed by ref.@xcite .",
    "when calculating the likelihood , we marginalize the nuisance parameters , like the absolute magnitude @xmath45 and the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , as explained by ref .",
    "in this section we re - examine the possible tension between constraints on @xmath1 from planck and the local direct @xmath1 probes in the @xmath0cdm and @xmath3cdm models and list the constraints on some related cosmological parameters from different data combinations in table [ wcdmtable ] .",
    "firstly , we consider the flat @xmath0cdm model .",
    "when using the cmb data alone , we obtain @xmath8 c.l .",
    "constraints on the hubble constant : @xmath48 @xmath7 and @xmath49 @xmath7 from wmap9 and planck+wp , respectively . in order to quantify the difference of constraints on parameter @xmath50 obtained from two probes @xmath51 and @xmath52 , here we simply define a variable @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the median value and the standard error bar of parameter @xmath50 , respectively . in this case , the difference variable @xmath57 , which means the median value of @xmath1 from planck+wp departs from that obtained from wmap9 at about @xmath58 confidence level .",
    "this @xmath59 @xmath7 shift in @xmath1 between planck+wp and wmap9 is mainly due to the slightly higher matter density determined by planck+wp ( @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) ) compared to wmap9 ( @xmath62 ( @xmath61 ) ) .",
    "since the hubble constant is strongly anti - correlated with the current matter density fraction @xmath63 , we obtain the @xmath8 c.l .",
    "limits on the current matter density fraction of @xmath64 and @xmath65 from wmap9 and planck+wp data , separately , namely the difference @xmath66 which is similar with that of the hubble constant .",
    "besides the wmap9 data , we also compare the constraints of @xmath1 from planck+wp and the hst prior .",
    "due to small error bars and the large discrepancy between their median values , the tension becomes larger , @xmath67 , which is found by the planck data @xcite .",
    "this huge discrepancy can not be easily resolved by varying the parameters of the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "then , we move to the @xmath3cdm framework to see whether the tension between constraints on @xmath1 would be relaxed .",
    "the cmb anisotropies mainly contain the information about the high - redshift universe , but it is not directly sensitive to phenomena which affect the lower redshift universe , such as the nature of dark energy .",
    "there are very strong degeneracies among @xmath3 , @xmath63 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cmb data alone now can not able to constrain them very well , namely their @xmath68 limits of @xmath1 and @xmath3 are @xmath69 @xmath7 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 from wmap9 and planck+wp data alone , respectively .",
    "these constraints are also consistent with the hst prior , due to the large error bars . in order to break these degeneracies ,",
    "inferring @xmath3 or @xmath1 from cmb data requires the combination with lower redshift probes .",

    "however , the perturbation diverges when the w crosses the cosmological constant boundary .",
    "this can be seen explicitly from the following equations @xcite : @xmath75 mathematically it has been proved that the single - field dark energy models like quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite and k - essence @xcite can not give rise to w crossing -1 . to have the w across the cosmological constant boundary , it needs the quintom model @xcite where the extra degree of freedom have been introduced . in the literature , there have been many attempts to build models of this class and we refer to ref.@xcite for a recent review .    with the parametrization of the equation of state in eq.([eq_cpl ] )",
    ", the dark energy perturbation needs to be carefully treated . in 2005",
    ", we made a proposal @xcite based on the quintom theory .",
    "technically , we introduce a small positive constant @xmath76 to divide the full range of the allowed value of w into three parts : ( 1 ) @xmath77 ; ( 2 ) @xmath78 ; and ( 3 ) @xmath79 . neglecting the entropy perturbation contributions , for the regions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) the equation of state does not cross the @xmath11 boundary and perturbations are well defined by solving the above equations . for the region ( 2 )",
    ", we set @xmath80 and @xmath81 and match the perturbation in region ( 2 ) to those of the regions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) at the boundary . in the numerical calculations we limit the range to @xmath82 and find that this method is a very good approximation to the realistic model of dark energy which gives rise to w across -1 .",

    "[ cpl_check ] ]    in the planck analysis @xcite , they use the parameterized post - friedmann ( ppf ) method to handle the dark energy perturbations when w crosses @xmath85 , which was proposed by the ref.@xcite in the year of 2008 .",
    "we have checked the consistency between these two methods of treating the dark energy perturbation , which is shown in figure [ cpl_check ] .",
    "since the cmb data alone can not constrain the time - evolving dark energy model very well , here we use the planck+wp data and the snls data together to do the global analysis , in order to obtain the meaningful constraints .",
    "when using our own method , we obtain the constraints : @xmath9 and @xmath86 at @xmath8 confidence level .",
    "if we use the ppf method to handle the dark energy perturbations , the data sets yield the almost identical limits on dark energy parameters of @xmath9 and @xmath87 ( @xmath8 c.l . ) .",

    "clearly there is no tension on the hubble constant in the dynamical dark energy model .",
