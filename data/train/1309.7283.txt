    "there are several external mechanisms that undermine the quantum coherence of superconducting circuits being explored for quantum information processing @xcite . their influence has been reduced over the years by new designs that minimize the coupling with external degrees of freedom .",
    "however , a fundamental intrinsic decoherence process arises from the coupling of the qubit variables to superconducting quasiparticles tunneling through the josephson junctions of the circuits .",
    "although in principle the superconducting gap @xmath0 provides an inherent protection against low energy excitations at low temperatures , in practice there are residual nonequilibrium quasiparticles that can rule the behavior of the circuits @xcite . as shown in a recent experiment @xcite , this is particularly true for weak links containing channels of high transmission , where localized excitations occupying andreev levels of energy below @xmath0 become possible .",
    "this has important consequences for the corresponding proposed qubits designs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , single quasiparticle trapping in localized levels could be detrimental in experiments proposed to detect `` majorana bound states '' in condensed matter systems since their topological protection relies on parity conservation @xcite .",
    "understanding the dynamics of relaxation of quasiparticles in superconducting weak links is therefore an important present - day issue .",
    "we report here on a theory highlighting the role of the electromagnetic environment in this dynamics . in experiments , josephson junctions or weak links",
    "are very often embedded in electrical circuits having electromagnetic modes at frequencies lower than the superconducting gap .",
    "the environment can be a resonator intentionally coupled to the junction like in ref .  , or the plasma mode of another junction placed in parallel like in ref .",
    "we show that if the mode impedance is large enough , it rules the quasiparticle dynamics when the sum of the andreev level energy and of the energy of the mode exceed the superconducting gap .",
