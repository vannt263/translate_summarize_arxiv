    "distracted driving diverts driver s attention away from driving , which will endanger the safety of driver , passenger , and even pedestrian  @xcite .",
    "one recent study indicates that every year , at lease @xmath0 of all motor vehicle crashes or @xmath1 million crashes involve using cell phones and texting  @xcite . in united states , on a hand - held cell phone while driving is considered illegal in @xmath2 states and the district of columbia  @xcite , and over @xmath3 states and district of columbia forbid texting message while driving .",
    "the prevalence of cell phone and severe negative impact of driving and texting on safety have stirred numerous researches and innovations on detecting and preventing the behaviors of driving and texting .",
    "the majority effort has been on detecting this behavior using various technologies , such as mounting a camera to monitor the driver @xcite , relying on acoustic ranging through car speakers @xcite , or leveraging sensors and cloud computing to determine driver @xcite .",
    "another line of innovations is to prevent driver from using phones @xcite via signal jammer .",
    "recently , a number of apps have been developed to report driving and texting , , rode dog @xcite .",
    "these apps could not distinguish between the driver and passengers .",
    "these techniques have been shown to perform well under various circumstances and assumptions , but not without some limitations , , using extra infrastructures such as cameras or radio interceptor @xcite , requiring special vehicles ( bluetooth and special layout of speakers @xcite ) , or collaboration of multiple phones in the vehicle and cloud computing @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we address the fundamental and critical task of detecting the behavior of driving and texting by leveraging the smartphones carried by users .",
    "our system leverages various sensors ( , accelerometer , gyroscope , magnetometer sensor ) integrated in the smartphone and realizes our goal of distinguishing drivers and passengers and detecting texting using rich user micro - movements and irregularities that can be detected by these sensors _ before _ and _ during _ driving and texting .",
    "our system distinguishes the driver and passengers by performing the following tasks by fusing multiple evidences collected from accelerometer , magnetometer , and gyroscope sensors : 1)detecting whether a user is entering a vehicle or not , 2)inferring which side of the vehicle s / he is entering , 3)reasoning whether the user is siting in front or rear seats , and 4)discovering if a user is texting . without relying on external infrastructure , our system has an advantage of being readily implemented and adopted , while at the same time raising a number of challenges that need to be carefully addressed for achieving a successful detection with good _ sensitivity _ , _ specificity _ , _ accuracy _ , and _",
    "precision_. a common challenge is to minimize or even remove the negative impact of the inherent noise of the data collected by these sensors .",
    "another challenge is to increase the sensitivity , accuracy , and precision of detection , which is extremely difficult because of the potential pattern similarities among different user activities and the vast possibilities of how a user will drive and text ( , how a user will carry the phones , where the user will put the phone , how a user will enter the car , how will a user sit in the car ) .",
    "the third challenge is to design a real - time activity detection and recognition with high accuracy and energy efficiency .    to detect whether a user starts entering a vehicle as a driver , or is doing some other activities ( such as walking , siting , or entering a public transportation ) , we collected the data from accelerometer and magnetometer when users are performing various activities and observed some unique patterns ( by converting the signal to the frequency domain using dct and wavelet ) . to infer whether a user enters the vehicle from left side or right side of the vehicle , or sits in front or rear seats , we exploit the unique patterns in the accelerometer and magnetometer data observed from respective actions and",
    "make cognitive decision based on machine learning techniques .",
    "our system carefully exploits some unique external phenomena : 1 ) when vehicle engine is started , the data from magnetometer exhibits different patterns when users sit in front or back seats ; 2 ) the accelerometer data experiences different curves when the phone is placed in the front seats and back seats when the vehicle passes through a bump or pothole ; 3 ) the accelerometer data showed different and distinguishable patterns when user enters the vehicle from different sides even the user has the phone in different pockets . to validate our approaches , we conduct extensive experiments of our system with several kinds of vehicles and smartphones .",
    "our evaluation results show that our approach had a classification accuracy of 87.18% , and precision of 96.67% .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : related ] we briefly review the exiting work on distinguishing driver and passengers , and in general activity detection and recognition using inertial sensors .",
    "we present the system design in section  [ sec : design ] by discussing how we tackle several critical tasks for detecting texting by driver .",
    "section  [ sec : energy ] presents the energy consumption strategy of .",
    "we report our extensive evaluation in section  [ sec : evaluation ] and conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a number of innovative systems have been proposed and developed in the literature to distinguish between the driver and passenger , or prevent the driver from using the cellphone .",
    "the first line of work is to use some external devices to detect whether the driver is distracted or whether the driver is using a phone  @xcite .",
    "bergasa @xcite designed a feasible prototype to detect the driver distraction using special wearable equipment , a circuit equipped with a camera to monitor the driver s vigilance in real time .",
    "kutila @xcite developed another smart human - machine interface to measure the driver s momentary state by fusing stereo vision and lane tracking data  @xcite .",
    "although these two systems could detect the driver s distraction , they do not take the hand held devices into account , and the detection accuracy is approximately @xmath4 on average .",
    "salvucci @xcite built a cognitive architecture to predict the effects of in - car interface on driver s behavior based on cell phone . with the increasing number of accidents caused by using cell phone while driving , many efforts focus on reducing the dangerous driving distraction , but allowing drivers to deal with the devices with less effort , such as blind sight  @xcite , negotiator  @xcite , quiet calls  @xcite , and lindqvist  @xcite .",
    "most of the aforementioned designs require extra equipments or modifying cars to assist detecting the drivers activity , which will increase the system cost and coordination difficulty , or fail to take the presence of hand held smartphones into account .    other existing solutions for distinguishing driver and passenger rely on specific mechanisms to determine the location of the smartphones .",
    "for example , recently , yang @xcite present an innovative method by leveraging the high frequency beeps from smartphone over bluetooth connection through car s stereo system , and calculate the relative delay between the signal from speakers to estimate the location of smartphone  @xcite .",
    "however , a possible obstacle to this system is the requirement of using bluetooth , which may be not available in most old cars as well as new models either .",
    "even with bluetooth , because of the varying cabin sizes and stereo configurations , the accuracy may be compromised in some extent .",
    "chu @xcite presented a phone based sensing system to determine if a user in a moving vehicle is a driver or a passenger without relying on additional wearable sensors or custom instrumentation in the vehicle .",
    "they relied on collaboration of multiple phones to process in - car noise and used a back - end cloud service in differentiating the front seat driver from a back seat passenger . compared with these systems ,",
    "our system will only use the smartphone carried by the driver and does not require special devices in the car .",
    "our approaches involve a number of activity detection and recognition using inertial sensors integrated in smartphones , which has been studied for various different purposes  @xcite .",
    "bao @xcite performed activity recognition based on multiple accelerometer sensors , deployed on specific parts of human body , such as wrist , arm , ankle , or thigh .",
    "parkka @xcite proposed a system embedded with @xmath5 different wearable sensors to recognize activities .",
    "tapia @xcite presented a real - time algorithm to recognize not only physical activities , but also their intensities using five accelerometers and a wireless heart rate monitor .",
    "krishnan  @xcite demonstrated that putting accelerometers in certain parts is inadequate to identify activities , such as sitting , walking , or running .",
    "mannini @xcite introduced multiple machine learning methods to classify human body postures and activities , including lying , sitting , running , and climbing , based on accelerometers attached to certain positions on the body .",
    "lee @xcite introduced a novel system to identify user s location and activities through accelerometer and angular velocity sensor in the pocket , combined with a compass on the waist .",
    "ravi @xcite used hp ipaq to collect acceleration data from sensors wirelessly , and recognize the motion activities .",
    "a few studies perform activity detection and recognition using commercial mobile devices  @xcite , which are more practical and unobtrusive .",
    "unfortunately , these systems and approaches can not be used for distinguishing driver and passenger and detecting driving and texting activities .",
    "to address the driver - passenger challenge , we will leverage the existing inertial sensors integrated in smartphones and exploit some unique and distinguishable patterns observed from a sequence of sensory data . in this section ,",
    "we discuss in detail design goals , the approach to detect which side a user is entering the car , and which row the user is sitting , for location classification .",
    "the purpose of our system is to distinguish the driver and the passengers using smartphone only without any assistance of dedicated infrastructures or intrusive equipments in the vehicle .",
    "the key goal that led to our inertial sensor approach is to be able to determine various activities and classify the phone location from the observed unique and distinguishable micro - movements and sequential patterns .",
    "this pure phone software solution , however , leads to several technical challenges :    * robust to diversity and ambiguity of human activities : * the system requires a real - time activity recognition to identify the driver with high accuracy and low delay .",
    "for example , when we know that a user is walking towards the car , we should start the algorithm to determine if s / he enters the car or not , and determine if s / he is a driver or passenger .",
    "however , because of the difference of smartphone s orientation , position and location , same user activity may result multiple irregular sensory data .",
    "in addition , we need an effective method to detect the starting point and the duration of an activity for the purpose of increasing the accuracy while considering the randomness of action even by the same user .",
    "we assume that the behaviors between drivers and passengers are different , especially during the action of entering the vehicle and driving .",
    "we need to carefully identify the signal and patterns that can be used for accurate distinguishing .    * robust to data",
    "noise : * it is widely accepted and verified in our testing that the data collected by the inertial sensors in smartphones contain significant noise .",
    "if it is not carefully addressed , such noise may override the small changes caused by different human activities .    * computation and energy efficiency : * as smartphones have limited computation capability and limited energy supply , standard smartphone platforms should be able to execute the system in an online manner with running time of seconds or sub - second .",
    "the system will be running at background in carefully selected dynamic duty cycle .",
    "thus we need a careful tradeoffs between efficiency and detection accuracy .",
    "we now briefly describe the architecture of our system . in this work",
    "we propose a three - phase solution to accomplish the task : recognizing the action , locating the user in the vehicle , and determining the role of the user based on assembled information .",
    "figure  [ fig : process ] illustrates various components of our system that will be described in details .        *",
    "activity identification : * when driving or sitting in the vehicle , the behaviors are different from most of the other activities in our daily lives .",
    "empirically , such driving activities usually start from walking towards the vehicle , and are followed by entering the vehicle , fastening the seat belt , or even pressing the gear and brake .",
    "thus , walking will be detected periodically , and we looking for the action of entering the vehicle following the detection of the walking action . notice that our system does * not * require _ any _ interaction from the user , thus , it is critical to find when a user will enter the vehicle so that no driving and texting activity is missed .",
    "generally , most of users get used to carry smartphone for a whole day , the system will definitely record multiple kinds of behaviors throughout one day . a research task here is to identify related activities from a rich set of potential daily activities , including walking , sitting , standing or going upstairs .",
    "we observe that most time different activities will be reflected in different micro - movements and motion patterns , although sometimes different activities will have similar `` observed '' patterns .",
    "we will exploit some subtle differences ( , the different frequency distribution when converting the time - series data to the frequency domain , the variance of the amplitude of the time - series data ) between observed data from various sensors ( , accelerometer , magnetometer , and gyroscope ) for recognizing driving activity from other activities .    by collecting the daily activities , we study the distribution of activities and temporal and spatial relationship between different activities , and construct a hidden markov model ( hmm )  @xcite to analyze the behavior based on the observed sensory data .",
    "this model will then be used to further reduce the energy consumption by carefully adjusting the operating duty - cycle of the system .    *",
    "detecting left vs. right : * the second component of our system is to determine whether a user entered the vehicle from the left side of the vehicle or the right side of the vehicle .",
    "if the user is recognized to have entered the vehicle from the right side , taking us as an example , the user must be a passenger usually .",
    "but we still can not judge the role precisely if the user is from the left side .",
    "we found that the accelerometer data exhibits different patterns when a user entered the vehicle from different sides and having the smartphone at different pockets .",
    "* detecting front vs. back : * detecting the side can not uniquely identify the driver .",
    "thus , the third phase is proposed to determine whether the user is sitting in the front seats or back seats .",
    "together with the side information , we can determine the location of the phone in a vehicle .",
    "suppose there are one driver seat and three passenger seats in the vehicle .",
    "take us as an example , the user must be the driver if he is sitting in the left side of the front row .",
    "our approach relies on two separate signals .",
    "first _ signal is the change of magnetic field strength value .",
    "our extensive tests show that when the phone is in the front half of the car , we can see an obvious change in the collected magnetometer data when the vehicle engine is started .",
    "second _ signal is the change of the accelerometer value based on different road condition .",
    "we observed that when a car passing through a bump or a pothole , there are unique and distinguishable patterns when the phone is in the front seats or the back seats .",
    "the bump signal , although not guaranteed to happen , can always accurately determine whether the phone is in front seats or rear seats .",
    "* further improvement : * although these phases provide us some information of the behavior and location of the user in a vehicle , we can not neglect the issue regarding the identification accuracy . in this work we rely on machine learning process and evidence fusion to further improve the accuracy . for example , when driving , the driver may text in an abnormal patterns , while the passenger , on the other hand , may still follow regular patterns .    to further improve the robustness of our system , we consider the diversity of human activities , , considering the fact that users put their smartphone in different locations according to individual habit  @xcite .",
    "another issue worth mentioning is that the system will be running at background , and operating the entering - vehicle recognition and side detection in real time , rather than keep recording the sensory data into local buffer and detect the activities through rolling back which is most common way .",
    "the strategy is determined based on two main reasons , efficiency and reducing cost .",
    "suppose the system starts recording the sensory data at time @xmath6 , as shown in figure  [ fig : strategy1 ] . at time @xmath7",
    ", the user starts entering a car which lasts @xmath8 .",
    "he starts driving after a delay of @xmath9 sitting inside the car .",
    "it is common that a user may make a phone call before driving .",
    "once the system detects the driving behavior with detection delay @xmath10 , after users has driven for time @xmath11 .",
    "the whole duration of the sequence of actions will last @xmath12 .",
    "however , the exact duration of every @xmath13 is unknown and unpredictable , the amount of sensory data which have to be stored in the buffer will be extremely large if we do offline detection .",
    "while in our real - time detection system , we can distinguish driver at time @xmath14 without buffering data .",
    "suppose the smartphone is carried by the user and placed in a pocket , the motion of a human body is reflected on the motion of smartphone through three inertial sensors ( accelerometer , magnetometer , and gyroscope ) .",
    "in our system , the sampling rate is set as @xmath15 , and then a series of changing values on the sensor readings will represent the continuous human activity .    as a rigid body , the readings from sensors only apply to the coordinate of smartphone , which could be denoted as body frame coordinate ( bfc ) .",
    "since the motion condition of smartphone is irregular and unpredictable , without knowing the posture of the phone in the pocket , it is difficult to analyze the human behavior in detail . on the other hand , from the perspective of the earth , individual person may act by following some hidden regular pattern unconsciously , and the only difference may be the frequency , duration and the amplitude of the behavior . in this case , we extract the readings from the sensors , and convert the value into the earth frame coordinate ( efc ) to represent the activity .",
    "in addition , in order to reduce the noise coming from both intrinsic mechanical structure and measurement , we adopt a calibrated orientation method through extended kalman filter ( ekf ) .",
    "a key challenge of this system is to identify specific activities in real - time , especially determining whether a user will enter a vehicle or is just performing other activities , which have similar observable patterns as that of entering a vehicle . here",
    "we will mainly focus on the analysis of pattern recognition , including the walking and entering the vehicle .",
    "the system is running at the background and will capture sensory data from three inertial sensors according to sophisticated duty cycle strategy .",
    "then , the acquired data will be processed and classified into specific activities through specially designed activity recognition method .",
    "[ [ activity - recognition ] ] activity recognition + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as the sensors will collect data continuously , a critical step in activity recognition is to identify the starting time and ending time of an activity from a sequence of temporal data collected .",
    "the second critical step in activity recognition is an effective feature extraction , which will be the foundation for machine learning based activity recognition . in our system",
    ", we adopt discrete cosine transform ( dct )  @xcite to extract features from linear acceleration to represent the specific action .",
    "although the system mainly focuses on detecting driving activity , the system will also encounter many other activities as it is running in the background with a carefully selected adaptive duty - cycle .",
    "for the purpose of driving activity detection and establishing hmm , we classify activities into three categories _ walking _ , _ entering vehicle _ , and _ other activities _ ( including sitting , going upstairs , downstairs , or getting on the bus ) . both the walking behavior and going upstairs or downstairs involve repetitive motions , and the activity pattern could be reflected from the acceleration on the direction of ground , as shown in figure  [ fig : walk_jean]and  [ fig : stairs ] .",
    "sitting down is another activity which will be detected multiple times throughout a day , the pattern is illustrated in figure  [ fig : sit ] .",
    "the behavior of getting on the bus is more complicated than the rest , because it consists of multiple other activities and the duration is much longer than the others , as shown in figure  [ fig : get_on_bus ] .",
    "however , the patterns of these behaviors are different from each other , and it is not that difficult to distinguish each other . in order to evaluate the performance of the activity recognition , we monitor the behavior for one specific user for one week , and collect multiple cases of sensory data . in our initial test , we collect the activities of walking , sitting down , and going upstairs @xmath5 cases each , and @xmath16 other behaviors , including running , jumping , jogging . in this work , we choose naive bayesian classifiers  @xcite to detect and identify activities related to driving .",
    "naive bayesian classifier could distinguish activities from the other in an acceptable accuracy ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "our system is carefully designed to meet the requirement of online learning and real - time classifying .",
    "it collects the inertial sensory data while triggers the signal when specific activities are detected .",
    "it also adjusts the activity model in real - time as new training examples from users are collected .",
    "the protocol will adapt the new feature changes over time , train and reconstruct the model as the system being applied to other user .",
    "[ [ entering - vehicles-1 ] ] entering vehicles ?",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we first extract the feature of entering the vehicle by conducting extensive testing . typically , the activity of getting into the vehicle consists of following steps : walking towards the vehicle , opening the door , turning the body , entering , and sitting down .",
    "empirically , the duration of entering vehicle activity is relatively small . in our system",
    ", we set the window size of the sampled data for activity recognition as @xmath18 seconds , which is based on the extensive evaluation to be presented later .",
    "we then extract the feature regarding the linear acceleration in both the horizontal plane and ground direction in efc .    in addition",
    ", the behavior will consist of two different cases according to the entering side , and such activity patterns are different .",
    "although the user s behavior could be reflected through build - in inertial sensors in attached smartphone , we can not neglect the position where smartphones are put .",
    "a recent study  @xcite indicates that male users usually carry their phones in trouser pockets in most cases ( @xmath19 ) while only @xmath20 put in the upper body pocket .",
    "we first study the circumstance that the phone is in the pocket of trousers .",
    "we take a set of testing of entering the vehicle from both sides in the parking lot by a group of colleagues with smartphones under left and right trousers pocket respectively .",
    "we collect @xmath21 samples of the entering - vehicle activity from both sides . due to irregular and unpredictable orientations of the smartphone",
    ", we transform all the data from bfc to efc . since in efc , the _ x _ and _ y _ axes record the data along the magnetic north and east , with different orientation of the vehicle , the acceleration in time domain will also be different , which will lead to the mismatch in the following activity recognition process .",
    "on the other hand , no matter which orientation the vehicle directs , the activity , from the perspective of the head of vehicle , will still be the same .",
    "thus , we calculate the vector of joint linear acceleration in the horizontal plane by @xmath22 , and present the activity of entering the vehicle in both horizontal plane and ground direction in two cases in figure  [ fig : enter_2d ] , where the difference is much more obvious .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : res_bump ]    when it comes to the street test , the results are slightly different .",
    "the experiment is taken in a suburb at night , the total distance is approximately @xmath27 miles with local road and highway .",
    "both the driver and back seat passenger turn on the system to estimate its exact location in the car according to the sensory data while driving .",
    "the smartphone of driver detects @xmath28 samples of readings and @xmath29 of bumps and potholes , while the back seat passenger only detects @xmath30 samples but @xmath31 bumps and potholes . the sampling number is different because of the starting time of passenger is behind the driver . in addition , although the number of bumps and potholes being detected by both smartphones are different , both smartphones report they are in the right location with accuracy of @xmath32 .",
    "we then detect the regulation of texting to detect if the user is driving or not .",
    "we sample @xmath5 different cases with @xmath33 texting in normal condition and the rest in driving condition tested in the parking lot .",
    "each sentence is approximately @xmath5 to @xmath3 words , we collect the input time interval and calculate the average value in real time . in figure",
    "[ fig : eva_text2 ] , we draw two pink lines , identifying the average time interval of each scenario , and the green dash line in the middle as the standard classifier .",
    "all the dots should be separated by the standard classifier , with the blue ( normal texting ) below and red ( texting while driving ) in above .",
    "the two error classification are denoted in black circle .",
    "the evaluation in texting detecting is reliable and feasible , the accuracy is @xmath34 .",
    "the decision of driver detection is based on previous sub - processes through evidence fusion .",
    "when doing real time recognition , the system slides the window with step @xmath35 to match the stored behavior through naive bayes classifier .",
    "since the activity could be detected in multiple times because of the sliding window , we consider a continuous same activity recognition to be a successful recognition . and taking the acceleration into account as a filter , the recognition could provide high level of credit for current recognition .",
    "based on our experiment , we notice that the performance of mainly depends on the first two phases .",
    "we test the performance of driver detection based on the fusion of all the phases , the precision is @xmath36 and accuracy @xmath37 .",
    "meanwhile , according to the real evaluation in android smartphone , the recognition delay is only @xmath38 second .",
    "the energy consumption of the system is determined by the running duration of inertial sensors .",
    "besides , the android api provides four different level of sampling rates , with the energy consumption being largest ( @xmath39  @xcite ) in the fastest level , which the sensory data being delivered without any delay .",
    "the working strategy of the system is determined based on individual life pattern , more specifically , the behavior regulation .",
    "we take a group of experiments using galaxy s@xmath40 to test the energy consumption in high density sampling . without using any inertial sensors , the battery drop @xmath41 within half an hour , but @xmath42 when the inertial sensors are triggered .",
    "however , in this process , we reduce the detecting rate to @xmath43 in every one minute with the sensor sampling rate @xmath44 , which on the other hand , match the transition probability of transferring from walking to entering car . based on the test , the battery reduce only @xmath45 for half an hour .",
    "other existing works utilize gps to determine whether the user is in driving vehicle .",
    "although such solutions do not require sensors to monitor the behavior and adjust the user habit , the energy consumption from gps is much larger than sensors .",
    "in addition , the system has to open gps and store sensory data for a certain duration , depending on when the driving behavior is detected . in our experiment , the battery discharge from @xmath46 to @xmath47 for the same testing duration .",

    "our system leverages inertial sensors integrated in smartphone and accomplish the objective of driver - passenger distinguishing without relying any additional equipment .",
    "we evaluate each process of the detection , including activity recognition and show that our system achieves good sensitivity , specificity , accuracy and precision , which leads to the high classification accuracy . through evaluation ,",
