    "however , _ only _ gravitational interaction between the disk and planet might result in similar radial structures in three disk components ( the gas and the large and small dust grains ) , i.e. , no radial difference ; thus _ only _ disk - planet interaction would also be less likely in pds  70 .",
    "other scenarios mentioned in   [ sec : intro ] ( dust filtration and radiation pressure ) need planet(s ) in the gap . in this sub - section ,",
    "we briefly review and discuss the combinations of scenarios : disk - planet interaction with dust filtration and/or radiation pressure .",
    "dust filtration @xcite is induced at the outer edge of the gap .",
    "dust filtration has been originally suggested to explain apparently contradictory transitional disk properties : a t - tauri - star - like moderate mass accretion rate ( @xmath8410@xmath85 to 10@xmath86  @xmath10  yr@xmath11 ; @xcite ) with an optically thin or empty inner hole . since the disk - materials in the inner disk are resupplied from the outer disk through mass accretion , moderate mass accretion and an inner hole are apparently inconsistent . to interpret these transitional disk properties ,",
    "theorists make use of a physical consequence that dust particles are trapped at gas - pressure maxima .",
    "when a dust particle embeds in a gaseous disk where the pressure has a radially negative gradient , since the gas rotates with the sub - keplerian velocity , a dust particle feels a headwind and loses angular momentum . on the other hand ,",
    "when a gaseous disk s pressure has a radially positive gradient , for example , at the outer edge of the gap , since the gas rotates with the super - keplerian velocity , a dust particle feels a tailwind and gains angular momentum .",
    "eventually , dust particles are led into gas - pressure maxima .",
    "the gas can still accrete onto the central star through the gap @xcite even there are multiple planets in the gap @xcite .",
    "that is how large dust grains are distributed at gas - pressure maxima , whereas moderate mass accretion is still observable .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that though dust filtration with a single or multiple planets affects ( sub-)millimeter dust particles , which possibly accounts for ( sub-)millimeter observations of large gapped ( @xmath8720  au ) transitional disks with moderate mass accretion of @xmath610@xmath85 to 10@xmath86  @xmath10  yr@xmath11 , the filtration process hardly affects ( sub-)micron sized dust particles since small dust grains are generally coupled well with the gas .",
    "this can nicely explain the missing gaps in nir scattered light images of some transitional disks @xcite , such as sr  21 @xcite , sao  206462 @xcite , and mwc  758 @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies in dust filtration @xcite calculated the position of gas pressure maxima depends on disk viscosity , the planetary mass , and location ( e.g. , a gas pressure maximum at 30 and 50  au when 1 and 9  @xmath7 at 20  au , respectively , in fig .  1 in @xcite ) ; @xcite showed observed radii of the gap in the nir and sub - millimeter wavelengths could also depend on the planetary mass and location ( e.g , gap radii in the nir and sub - millimeter wavelengths are 20 and 30  au , respectively , when a planet with 1  @xmath7 at 20  au in fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the radius of the gap in the nir wavelengths could reflect the scattered position at the outer gap - edge of the disk in small dust grains carved by a planetary perturbation , while the radius in the ( sub)-millimeter wavelength reflects the peak position of the dust surface - density ( i.e. , gas pressure - maximum which slightly locates at the far side ; see fig .  7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of the dust - gas coupling on the size of the dust grains leads to different gap - radii at different wavelength , as seen in pds  70 .",
    "such disk systems have been reported in sao  206462 @xcite , hd  100546 @xcite , and sz  91 @xcite ; thus pds  70 is not unique .    as pointed out by @xcite , one problem in dust filtration",
    "is that it is difficult to account for the low nir excess generally seen in transitional disks .",
    "in addition to dust filtration , to reduce the nir excess generated from small dust grains , ` a planetary accretion luminosity ' was proposed by @xcite in which small dust grains are expected to push back by radiation pressure from an accreting planet , resulting in allowing the dust - free gas to accrete onto the central star @xcite .",
    "this scenario would be useful to explain the properties of general transitional disks with the reduced nir excess and moderate mass accretion .",
    "however , in contrast to general transitional disks , weak - line t  tauri star pds  70 should have low mass accretion ( a h@xmath57 equivalent width of 2.0   ; @xcite ) .      though we have discussed the possible scenarios to explain the asymmetries in pds  70 , all proposed scenarios except eccentricity",
    "are hardly excluded based on our single epoch and single wavelength observations with sma (   [ sec : morphology ] ) . on the other hand , we found disk - planet interaction @xmath88 dust filtration could account for different radial structures in small and large grains (   [ sec : structure ] ) . in this sub - section",
    ", we discuss whether disk - planet interaction @xmath88 dust filtration is potentially responsible for the complicated structures of the disk around pds  70 .",
    "planet(s ) in the gap could reduce mass accretion and might explain the low mass accretion of pds  70 . though mass accretion onto a planet is not conclusively understood , in general , a more massive planet ( e.g. , 10  @xmath7 ) or multiple planets ( e.g. , 1  @xmath7 ) could reduce mass accretion onto the central star .",
    "since the existence of such a single 10  @xmath7 planet was already ruled out in our previous studies @xcite , accreting multiple planets remain as a possible scenario .",
    "if a single planet with @xmath31  @xmath7 can be assumed to have sufficient mass accretion onto the planet itself and induce dust filtration , this planet might be responsible for the large - gapped disk - structure in the dust continuum @xcite and low accretion rate of pds  70 .",
    "however , a single planet would likely induce a relatively symmetric structure in the disk @xcite and thus be inconsistent with the asymmetries observed in pds  70 .",
    "meanwhile , a single planet with @xmath31  @xmath7 could create the asymmetries in the disk if vortices take place at the gap - edge sculpted by this single planet .",
    "however , a single planet is expected to create a narrow gap in the gas and small dust grains ( i.e. , @xmath8915  au ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; hence a single accreting planet inducing vortices would be ruled out as the origin of the large nir gap around pds  70 .",
    "remaining accreting multiple planets could explain both of low mass accretion and the asymmetries of the large gapped - disk in pds  70 .",
    "these combinations could also induce dust filtration at the gap - edge and are likely to account for the different gap - radii in the nir and millimeter wavelengths .    to summarize , accreting multiple planets inducing dust filtration at the outer gap - edge could explain all observed properties of pds  70 : different observed radii of the gap in the different wavelengths ; low mass accretion onto the central star ; a depletion of disk components inside the gap except the optically think inner disk ; no very massive planets in the gap .",
    "however , direct observational evidence of dust filtration has not been detected in any disk system .",
    "one conclusive observational proof of dust filtration would be ` a gap in the gas ' ( see , e.g. , fig .  7 in",
    "as mentioned , in the outside of the planetary orbit , a combination of positive and negative gas - pressure gradients is critical to trap large dust grains at gas - pressure maxima . inside the planetary orbit",
    ", gas - pressure would have only negative gradients , resulting in the depletion of large dust grains .",
    "future alma observations with high - resolution and high - sensitivity will enable the detection of a gas gap .",
    "furthermore , detecting any planets in the gap would be important to verify whether planets form gap structures in the dust grains and induce dust filtration . a hint to enhance the detectability of planets in the optical / nir wavelength",
    "may be the planetary accretion luminosity @xcite .",
    "though a low - mass binary , a companion in the gap of hd  142527 ( a mass of 2.2  @xmath10 ; a distance of 145  pc ; an age of 5  myr ; @xcite ) exhibit an accretion luminosity and was detected in the narrow band of h@xmath57 @xcite .",
    "therefore , integral field spectroscopy combined with angular differential imaging ( adi ; * ? ? ? * ) or spectral differential image ( sdi ; * ? ? ?",

    "m ) may increase the detectability and allow discovery of accreting planets in the gap .",
    "we present the dust continuum at 1.3  mm and @xmath1co  @xmath2 line emission of the pre - transitional disk around pds  70 obtained with sma , and compare these with nir ( 1.6  @xmath0 m ) polarized intensity image from our previous studies to investigate the radial distributions of the gas and the large ( millimeter size ) and small ( @xmath0 m size ) dust grains in the disk .",
    "the main observational results are as follows .    * three disk - components ( the gas and the large and small dust grains ) show the deficit of flux density in the central region of the disk , suggesting depletion of the materials except small dust grains .",
    "high - resolution observations using alma would give more stringent constraints on the gas and large dust grains in the inner disk .",
    "* both large and small dust grains show azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "the contrast ratio of the flux density at the peak position to that at the opposite side is 1.4 in the dust continuum . since other transitional disks around solar - mass stars have the contrast ratio is @xmath31.1 - 1.2 , the pds  70 s contrast ratio is slightly higher among solar - mass stars .",
    "* the results of monte carlo radiative transfer models suggest different radii for the gap edges : 80 and 65  au for large and small grains , respectively . *",
    "we observed a velocity gradient from the northwest to southeast in @xmath1co  @xmath2 line emission , suggesting a rotating disk around pds  70 .",
    "the position - velocity diagram of the co gas infers the dynamical mass of pds  70 of 0.6 - 0.8  @xmath10 , which is consistent with the spectral type of k5 .",
    "we have discussed the possible origin of the azimuthal asymmetries in the disk . though definite conclusions are not reached from our sma and previous subaru observations , we anticipate gravitational interaction between multiple planets and the disk , or azimuthal temperature and opacity variance , or anticyclonic vortex could be responsible for the observed asymmetries .",
    "future follow - up observations to test opacity distributions and azimuthal rotations of the asymmetries are expected to put further constraints .    finally , gap formation with different gap - radii in large and small grains around pds  70",
    "have also been discussed . as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , both grain growth and photoevaporation",
    "are unlikely because they require an inside - out process that directly contradicts the presence of optically thick inner disk around pds  70 .",
    "we argue that combinations of accreting multiple planets and dust filtration explain the observations of the gap structure , low mass accretion , and different radii in the outer gap - edge as well as the asymmetries of pds  70 .",
    "future observations to confirm the existence of multiple planets and dust filtration are desirable . in alma cycle  2",
    ", a spatial resolution will be comparable to 0.@xmath591 - 0.@xmath592 of nir observations .",
