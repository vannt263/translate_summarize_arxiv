    "isostructural and isovalent laofep and laofeas are layered conductors , the first being superconducting at t@xmath3=2.5 k@xcite while the second becomes antiferromagnetically ordered at t@xmath4 @xmath5 140 k@xcite and is not superconducting .",
    "the discovery of superconductivity at 26 k in carrier - doped laofeas@xcite , followed by rapid improvement now up to t@xmath3=55 k@xcite in this class , makes these superconductors second only to the cuprates in critical temperature .",
    "several dozen preprints appeared within the two months after the original publication , and many hundred since , making this the most active field of new materials study in recent years ( since the discovery in mgb@xmath6 , at least ) .    a host of models and ideas about the `` new physics '' that must be operating in this class of compounds is appearing , pointing out the need to establish a clear underpinning of the basic electronic ( and magnetic ) structure of the system .",
    "the materials are strongly layered , quasi - two - dimensional in their electronic structure , by consensus .",
    "the electronic structure of laofep was described by lebgue,@xcite with the electronic structure and its neighboring magnetic instabilities of laofeas being provided by singh and du@xcite .",
    "several illuminating papers have appeared since , outlining various aspects of the electronic and magnetic structure of laofeas .",
    "the extant electronic structure work has provided a great deal of necessary information , but still leaves many questions unanswered , and indeed some important questions are unaddressed so far . in this paper",
    "we address some of these questions more specifically .",
    "stoichiometric laofeas is afm ; then @xmath70.05 carriers / fe doping of either sign destroys magnetic order and impressive superconductivity arises , with @xmath8 seemingly depending little on the carrier concentration . another question is : with the nonmagnetic electronic structure of laofep and laofeas being so similar , why is the former superconducting while the latter is ( antiferro)magnetic ? surely this difference must be understood and built into bare - bones models , or else such models risk explaining nothing , or explaining anything .",
    "another question is the effect of the structure .",
    "unusual sensitivity to the as height @xmath0(as ) has been noted@xcite ; t@xmath3 is reported to increase with applied pressure@xcite ( reduction in volume ) for low values of doping ( up to @xmath9 in lao@xmath10f@xmath11feas , which is reported as the amount of f for optimal doping ) ; there are increases in t@xmath3 due to replacement of la with other rare earth ions , and the variation in size of the rare earth is often a dominant factor in the observed trends in their compounds . very important also is the magnetism in these materials , as magnetism is a central feature in the cuprate superconductors and in correlated electron superconductors .",
    "another important question is : what can be expected if other pnictide atoms can be incorporated into this system : sb ( or even bi ) on the large atom side , or n on the small atom end . in this paper",
    "we address these questions .",
    "the members of the family of the new fe - based superconductors crystallize in the zrcusias type structure@xcite ( space group p4/nmm , z = 2 ) .",
    "for instance , laofeas is made of alternating lao and feas layers , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .     ,",
    "scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the fe and o atoms lie in planes , while the as and la atoms are distributed on each side of these planes following a chessboard pattern .",
    "the crystal structure is fully described by the a and c lattice parameters , together with the internal coordinates of la and as .",
    "experimentally , @xmath12   and @xmath13  , while z(la ) = 0.14154 and z(as ) = 0.6512 .     magnetic structure of the fe - as substructure of laofeas , showing alternating chains of fe spin up ( red circles with black dots ) and fe spin down ( blue circles with black crosses ) .",
    "the as atoms above ( below ) the fe plane are represented as large ( small ) squares .",
    "the @xmath14 cell is represented in full lines , while the @xmath15 cell is in dashed lines .",
    "[ fig : afm ] , scaledwidth=28.0% ]    however to describe correctly the antiferromagnetic structure , a @xmath14 cell must be used , with four fe atoms per cell , as shown in full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : afm ]",
    ". we will refer to this antiferromagnetic order as the q@xmath16 afm order , or equivalently as ( @xmath17 ) , while the q@xmath18 afm order corresponds to an antiferromagnetic order of the original cell ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : afm ] ) with two fe atoms .",
    "also , fm will refer to a ferromagnetic arrangement of the spins , while nm means non - magnetic .",
    "to calculate the relevant quantities , we have used density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , as implemented in three different electronic structure codes .",
    "the full potential local orbital ( fplo ) code@xcite was mainly used , while we double checked some of the calculations with wien2k code @xcite . for most of the fplo and lapw calculations ,",
    "the perdew and wang 1992 ( pw92)@xcite exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional was used , but the effect of xc functional was checked using also lsda(pz)@xcite , the pbe ( perdew _ et al . _ 1996)@xcite , and another gga ( perdew _ et al . _",
    "1992)@xcite xc functionals . at each constant volume ,",
    "the crystal structure was fully relaxed , i.e. , @xmath19 , @xmath0(la ) and @xmath0(pn ) were relaxed , where pn is the pnictogen atom .",
    "the errors were estimated to be within 0.5@xmath20 for c / a , and 1.0@xmath20 for z(la ) and z(pn ) .",
    "the relaxation was performed in the q@xmath16 afm structure , with 132 irreducible k points in the bz .",
    "we double checked the total energy with a finer mesh with 320 irreducible k points in the bz , and the difference is very small .",
    "after relaxation , all calculations were performed using dense meshes , with 320 , 1027 , and 637 irreducible k points in the bz of the q@xmath16 afm , q@xmath18 afm and nm structure , respectively . in the q@xmath16 afm structure , we used 464 irreducible k points in the bz to double check the result , without any noticeable difference in the dos nor band structure . as for the results presented in sect .",
    "[ sect - pipipi ] , we used the paw ( projector augmented waves ) method @xcite as implemented in the code vasp ( vienna ab - initio simulation package)@xcite .",
    "the perdew burke ernzerhof@xcite variant of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) was used for the exchange - correlation potential . a cut - off of @xmath21 ev",
    "was used for the plane - wave expansion of the wave function to converge the relevant quantities .",
    "for brillouin zone integrations , a mesh of @xmath22 @xmath23-points@xcite was used within the modified tetrahedron method@xcite .",
    "this mesh was decreased to @xmath24 for the cell doubled along the @xmath25 axis .",
    "laofeas has a tetragonal structure ( as described in sect . [",
    "sec : two ] ) at room temperature@xcite .",
    "although it undergoes a structural phase transition at lower temperature@xcite ( see section [ sect - pipipi ] ) , the doped ( and superconducting ) material lao@xmath10f@xmath11feas remains in this structure down to low temperature , so the study of laofeas in the high symmetry structure is a necessary step towards the understanding of the electronic structure of the whole family of compounds .",
    "first , we studied the electronic structure of laofeas in the experimental ( tetragonal ) crystal structure for different magnetic states ( q@xmath16 afm , q@xmath18 afm , fm and nm ) using two different codes ( fplo@xmath26 and wien@xmath27k ) and different exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "this is necessary in view of the large number of theoretical papers@xcite which appeared recently and often contain strong disagreements .",
    "this was partly studied by mazin",
    "_ et al._.@xcite table [ as - mag - xc ] summarizes the results : the magnetic moment on the fe atom together with the total energy differences for each magnetic state studied here .",
    "independent of the code or the xc functional used , the q@xmath16 afm state is always found to be the ground state , which confirms our earlier report@xcite .",
    "the magnetic moment for both afm orders are considerably larger than the ordered moment reported from neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation experiments , while the one for the fm order is much smaller .",
    "for this last case , fplo7 gives zero which indicates no magnetism with both pz and pw92 xc functional ; wien2k gives about 0.36 @xmath28@xmath29 with gga and pbe and 0.13 @xmath28@xmath29 with pw92 .",
    "it appears therefore that the magnetic moment of fe for the same state with different xc functionals varies by up to 0.5 @xmath28@xmath29 , which is unexpectedly large , although gga is known to enhance magnetism.@xcite the difference between fplo7 and wien2k in predicting the fe magnetic moment for each state may explain the total energy differences among them .",
    "virtual doping ( see subsection b ) by 0.1 e@xmath30/fe enhances the fe magnetic moment in the q@xmath16 afm state but reduces it in the fm state for all the xc functionals used .    in the structural optimization ( performed in the q@xmath16 state ) , fplo7 with pw92 ( lda ) functional gives reasonable c / a and z(la ) in good agreement with experiment , but it predicted z(as ) @xmath7 0.139 , which is 0.011 off the experimental value , about 0.1   in length .",
    "however , wien2k with pbe(gga ) xc functional gives an optimized z(as ) @xmath7 0.149 , which agrees well with experimental z(as ) .",
    "similar results are found in the xfe@xmath6as@xmath6 family ( x = ba , sr , ca ) too .",
    "it suggests that , gga ( pbe ) xc functional optimizes the feas - based system much better than lda ( pw92 ) xc functional . and gga should have better performance in dealing with the structure ( including c / a , equilibrium volume and z(as ) ) under pressure of this feas family",
    "this is probably due to the layered structure of the feas family which results in large density gradient between layers , thus gga has better description of the potential .",
    "but in the meantime , gga ( pbe ) further overestimates the magnetic moment of fe , which is already overestimated by lda ( pw92 ) .",
    ".calculated magnetic moment of fe , the amounts of total energy per fe lie below nonmagnetic state of fm , q@xmath18 afm and q@xmath16 afm states from fplo7 and wien2k with different xc functionals of laofeas with experimental structure .",
    "positive @xmath31 ee means lower total energy than nm state . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have investigated in some detail the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the laofeas class of novel superconductors using ab - initio methods .",
    "the effects of the fe - as distance , of doping , and of pressure , as well as calculations of the efgs have been reported .",
    "it was found that ( approximate ) electron - hole symmetry versus doping , and strong magnetophonon coupling are primary characteristics of the laofeas system , and are two of the ingredients that need to be understood to proceed toward the discovery the mechanism of superconducting pairing .",
    "we studied effects of the structural distortion and of the ( @xmath32 ) magnetic order , finding that experiments can be reproduced fairly well by our calculations .",
    "finally , the related materials laofep , laofesb , and laofen were investigated and their properties compared to those of laofeas . from these comparisons , it appears that laofep is significantly different from the other materials studied here ; this difference might explain why , at stoichiometry , laofep is superconducting while laofeas is antiferromagnetic .",
    "also , in view of their similarities with laofeas , either pure or doped laofesb and laofen are potential candidates as superconductors .",
