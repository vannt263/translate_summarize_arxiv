    "ultracold fermionic gases have attracted considerable attention in theoretical and experimental physics recently .",
    "this has been intensified after the experimental successes in creating bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in fermionic clouds .",
    "an important step was the development of techniques using magnetically detuned feshbach resonances @xcite , which allow to tune the mutual interaction strength between the fermions over a wide range .",
    "this novel opportunity to look at a transition from a weakly attractive bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state to a strongly attractive bec in one and the same system makes it interesting from a many - body point of view ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "measurements of the interaction strength of a fermionic gas near a feshbach resonance were made by time - of - flight expansion experiments @xcite .",
    "the collective excitations showed a strong dependence on the coupling strength as was shown experimentally @xcite .",
    "other experiments observed condensation @xcite and the spatial correlations @xcite of the fermionic atom pairs in the full crossover regime . using a spectroscopic technique",
    "the pairing gap was measured directly @xcite .",
    "the remarkable result was that the gap values were found in good agreement with a simple bcs expression in the whole crossover regime .",
    "one way to access the nature of the many - body state is to consider its statistics . a number of works proposed to use noise and higher - order correlations to probe the many - body states of ultracold atoms @xcite . for the bec - bcs transition",
    "the density and spin structure factor was calculated @xcite .",
    "schemes to measure the spatial pairing order interferometrically were proposed based on correlations in different output channels @xcite .",
    "to look at pairing fluctuations of trapped fermi gases has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "experimentally in @xcite the spatial structure of an atomic cloud was observed directly .",
    "this enables to determine the density fluctuations for example by repeating the experiment many times or by extracting densities at different positions in a homogeneous system to obtain the statistics .",
    "the shot noise of an atomic beam has been experimentally investigated both in bosonic and fermionic systems @xcite .",
    "further aspects of full counting statistics in ultracold atomic systems are discussed in the experimental work in ref .   and the theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "recently , amico and coworkers have considered the exact solution of the bcs model in some systems using the algebraic bethe - ansatz @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for average occupations and the number correlators have been obtained .",
    "subsequent work has tackled the problem numerically and found the bethe - ansatz solution to be numerically expensive @xcite .",
    "the approach to the occupation number correlators through the richardson solution , which we develop below , can lead to a numerically less expensive method in some cases .",
    "a recent review of the limit of large particle numbers of the richardson solution can be found in .    in a previous publication ,",
    "we have calculated the full statistics of particle number fluctuations in ultracold fermionic gases using a grand - canonical approach @xcite .",
    "the idea was to consider a ` bin ' , i.e. , a small subsystem of a homogeneous gas which contains a macroscopic number of particles , such that the surrounding atomic gas serves as the particle reservoir .",
    "fluctuations can in principle be accessed experimentally by performing a series of measurements of the number of particles in the subsystem at a fixed interaction constant , or by considering different bins of the system .",
    "the statistics in the whole bcs - bec crossover is hence obtained if one sequentially performs such sets of measurements from small to large interaction constant .",
    "due to its effective single - particle form one can calculate correlation functions using the ( grand - canonical ) bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) ground state solution @xcite .",
    "it was found that the bcs - bec transition yields a crossover in the statistics of the particle number .",
    "fluctuations around the average particle number are strongly suppressed on the bcs side and the statistical distribution is binomial . on the bec side ,",
    "fluctuations are strongly enhanced and are described by a poissonian statistics .",
    "since real ultracold gases consist of a finite number of particles , the grand - canonical approach may be inappropriate . in this article",
    "we thus focus on particle - number correlations obtained from the exact ground state using the methods developed by richardson @xcite .",
    "the richardson ground state is an eigenstate of the total particle number operator @xmath0 and thus allows a canonical treatment of the system . due to the complexity of the richardson solution",
    ", we restrict our investigations to a simplified level distribution consisting of two multiply degenerate energy levels .",
    "this allows us to compare explicitly the thermodynamic limit of the exact ground state and the approximate bcs solution .",
    "some model - independent properties of the statistics can be obtained in the limiting cases of vanishing or very strong interaction .",
    "although this is a toy model , it is relevant for a number of experimental situations .",
    "first , we note that the large degree of control possible in ultra - cold atomic systems , e.g. by using optical lattices or atomic chips , will make it possible to produce few - level systems , which can be loaded with a fixed number of fermions in a controlled way .",
    "experiments on particle number correlations in such systems will be described bny the theory developed below .",
    "our results apply equally well to level configurations , in which only two groups of levels are relevant .",
    "the level spacing within each group has to be smaller than the interaction constant ; the transition from weak to strong coupling appears for interactions of the order of the energy spacing between the groups .",
    "we would also like to mention , that the results obtained below for the strongly interacting limit are valid for any level configuration , in which the maximal level spacing is smaller than the interaction constant .",
    "hence , we believe that systems corresponding to the model we study can be experimentally produced , or , at least , some predictions can be tested in the limiting case of a strong interaction in an arbitrary level configuration .",
    "we start by recalling the basic properties of the richardson solution to the reduced hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian in second quantization and momentum space has the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 are hard - core bosonic annihilation operators .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian captures only the scattering fermions which occur in time - reversed states .",
    "it is therefore possible to express the particle number operator totally in terms of @xmath3-operators : @xmath4 this is true only in the subspace of fully paired states , to which we will restrict ourselves here and in the following .",

    "the normalization constant @xmath15 can be determined applying a standard determinant method @xcite .",
    "the quasi - energies @xmath16 in eq .  ( [ varphi ] ) are the solutions of the set of coupled root equations @xmath17 in general , the @xmath16 are complex quantities , however they always appear in complex - conjugate pairs .",
    "the corresponding energy eigenvalue is given by @xmath18 and is thus real , as required .",

    ", we will use the level spacing @xmath33 as our energy scale .",
    "the only ( dimensionless ) parameter left to characterize the system is the ratio between the interaction constant @xmath34 and the level spacing .",
    "the model of two highly - degenerate levels is clearly an artificial model , which can not be mapped to generic many - particle systems .",
    "however , we believe the model is nonetheless relevant also for experimental realizations due to two reasons . first , we show below that deviations of the occupation number correlators from a simple bcs mean - field treatment are relevant and can be detected in not too large systems . in experimental realizations of interacting fermi systems in ultracold atomic gases",
    "an unprecedented variability of system parameters has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "we therefore hope that our investigation will stimulate experimental efforts to create few - particle strongly - interacting systems and study the effects we predict below .",
    "second , within the same reasoning we believe that the large variability of tailoring atom systems in ( magneto-)optical traps or via atomic chips will make it possible to create an artificial highly - degenerate two - level system and to use it to study in a controlled manner the transition to the thermodynamic limit in a particularly simple system , as we predict here .      we want to illustrate some characteristics of the richardson solution by means of a simple setup within the two - level model .",
    "we consider , therefore , a system of two hard - core bosons in two threefold degenerate levels ( @xmath35 ) of energy @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "obviously , in the non - interacting limit at @xmath39 , the energies reduce to the bare pair energies 0 , 2 and 4 , corresponding to the case that @xmath40 and @xmath41 particles respectively are in the upper level . with increasing interaction @xmath42 , the ground state and first excited state energies are lowered continuously , whereas",
