    "the weak decay of @xmath10 mesons has become an unexpected and most valuable source of information on hadron structure and in particular a powerful instrument to investigate the nature of the scalar mesons , which is a permanent source of debate .",
    "the starting point in this line came with the observation in lhcb @xcite that in the @xmath11 decay into @xmath12 and @xmath7 a pronounced peak for the @xmath3 was observed , while no signal was seen for the @xmath2 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this finding was corroborated by following experiments by the belle  @xcite , cdf  @xcite , and d0  @xcite collaborations .",
    "soon it was also observed that in the @xmath14 decay into @xmath12 and @xmath7 @xcite , a clear signal was seen for @xmath2 production while no signal , or a very small one , was seen for @xmath3 .",
    "the low lying scalar mesons have been the subject of study within the unitary extension of chiral perturbation theory , the so - called chiral unitary approach , and a coherent picture emerges where these states are generated from the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons provided by the chiral lagrangians  @xcite .",
    "some other approaches use different starting points , like assuming a seed of @xmath15 @xcite , or a tetraquark component  @xcite , but as soon as these original components are allowed to mix with the unavoidable meson - meson components , the large strength of this interaction `` eats up '' the original seed and the meson - meson cloud becomes the largest component of the states .",
    "the dynamical picture to generate the scalar mesons from the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar interaction has been tested successfully in a large number of reactions  @xcite ( see a recent update in ref .",
    "however , the findings of the @xmath10 decays have opened a new line of research on this topic , offering new and useful information on the structure of these scalar mesons . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the features and ratios obtained from the experiments on @xmath10 decays could be well reproduced by the dynamical generation picture of the scalars .",
    "it was shown there , that although addressing the full complexity of these and related problems can be rather complicated and require many free parameters  @xcite , the evaluation of ratios of decay modes for some of these channels is rather simple and , in particular , allows one to get an insight on the structure of the scalar resonances .",
    "we shall also mention that our approach is based on the use of the dominant cabibbo allowed decay mechanisms at the quark level .",
    "the approach does not contain subdominant amplitudes which are also considered , for instance , in studies of @xmath16 violation  @xcite , but this is not our purpose here .",
    "a related but different path is followed in ref .",
    "@xcite , looking at the scalars from the point of view of @xmath15 or tetraquarks , but no consideration of the final state interaction of these mesons is done there , while this is at the heart of the generation of the scalar mesons in the chiral unitary approach .    the work of ref .",
