    "the resulting final recoil depends on the masses , orbital parameters , and spins of the bhs , and in special configurations ( i.e. with spins anti - aligned with each other ) , it can reach velocities as high as @xmath9 ( gonzlez 2007b ) .",
    "much of the recent literature focused on the astrophysical implications of high  velocity kicks , which may displace or remove supermassive bhs from galactic centers ( e.g. merritt et al . 2004 ; madau & quataert 2004 ; loeb 2007 ) , and inhibit the growth of bhs at high redshifts ( @xmath10 ) , where the escape velocities from low  mass galactic halos is small ( @xmath11 ; haiman 2004 , yoo & miralda - escude 2004 , shapiro 2005 ; volonteri & perna 2005 ) .    another exciting implication of kicks is that they may help produce an electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart of gravitational wave sources detected by the future _ laser interferometric space antenna _",

    "the discovery of such a counterpart would constitute a milestone for fundamental physics and astrophysics ( e.g. kocsis et al .",
    "if the bhb is surrounded by a circumbinary gas disk , the disk will respond promptly ( on the local orbital timescale ) to such a kick .",
    "if this results in warps or shocks , the disturbed disk could produce a transient em signature ( milosavljevi & phinney 2005 ) .",
    "the sky localization uncertainty from the _ lisa _ instrument several weeks prior to merger is typically a few square degrees ( kocsis et al .",
    "2007a ; lang & hughes 2007 ) , and the kick can begin building up at the end of the inspiral phase , before the final coalescence ( schnittman et al .",
    "this will make it possible , in many cases , to monitor a few square  degree area on the sky prior to , during , as well as immediately following the coalescence of bhs in the mass range @xmath12@xmath13 at redshifts out to @xmath14 , and search for a prompt transient signature associated with the kick ( kocsis et al .",

    ", we expect that the _ direction _ , in addition to the magnitude of the kick , will be important .",
    "naively , one expects that a kick within the plane of any circumbinary disk will be more likely to cause density enhancements and `` light up '' the disk than a kick perpendicular to it",
    ". the kick direction can be clearly important on larger scales , as well , and affect phenomena that would occur on long timescales ( @xmath15 years ) after the merger .",
    "for example , the angle relative to a large  scale galactic disk can determine whether a kicked bhb ends up outside the galaxy or not , and perhaps also whether shocks are produced when a bhb plunges into such a large  scale disk .",
    "while these issues merit investigation , in this _ letter _ we focus on the smaller scales and shorter timescales ( @xmath16 months ) that are relevant to prompt _ lisa _ counterparts .",
    "schnittman & buonanno ( 2007 ; hereafter sb07 ) used the `` effective one  body approach '' and derived a scaling formula that yields the recoil velocity vector for arbitrary mass ratios and spin vectors . while their results have not been tested for generic spins , they agree well ( to within 20 - 30% ) with numerical results in those special configurations where they were tested ( including numerical calculations for configurations with the spins parallel or at intermediate angles with respect to the orbital plane",

    "_ letter _ , we investigate the response of a circumbinary disk to the kick , by following the perturbed , keplerian orbits of collisionless massless test particles around the recoiling bhb .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate that prompt shocks or strong density enhancements are likely to arise when the kick is aligned with the plane of the circumbinary disk , whereas they may be less likely for highly inclined kicks .",
    "we will then use the formula of sb07 for the dependence of the kick speed and direction on the mass ratio and spins of the bhs , to argue that a significant fraction ( @xmath6 few % ) of kicks may be both sufficiently large and well aligned with the orbital plane for strong shocks to be produced within a few weeks after coalescence .",
    "we begin with the assumption that the kicked bhb is surrounded by a rotationally supported , geometrically thin gaseous circumbinary disk . the idealized case of a smooth axisymmetric accretion disk , aligned with the binary s orbital plane",
    "( bardeen & peterson 1975 ) , with a simple vertical structure can be described by its density and temperature profiles ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , as well as the scale height @xmath19 .",
    "this minimal information is needed ( i ) to compute the angle extended by the disk as viewed from the center , and ( ii ) to examine whether the kick is supersonic ( @xmath20 ; a necessary condition for shocks to occur ) .",
    "in addition , we need to know the overall disk size ( necessary to assess what fraction of the disk gas remains bound to the recoiling bhb ) , and whether the disk mass is comparable to the bhb mass ( necessary to assess whether the bhb is slowed down by the disk ) .    unfortunately , fully self - consistent and stable accretion disk models around supermassive bhs are both difficult to produce , and require many ad  hoc assumptions ( see , e.g. , the review by blaes 2007 for a list ) . while variants of the parametric so  called @xmath21disk models ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) have been successfully calibrated against observations of stellar ",
    "mass objects , observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have not led to similarly robust constraints on disk models around supermassive bhs . nevertheless , several authors have discussed the possible behavior of a circumbinary @xmath21disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a key quantity is the critical orbital semi ",
    "major axis @xmath22 at which the time",
    " scale for the decay of the orbit due to gravitational radiation becomes shorter than the time ",
    "scale for viscous evolution ( begelman et al . 1980 ) .",
    "once the binary separation shrinks below this value at @xmath23 , the gas outside will not evolve significantly before the bhs coalesce .",
    "most of the `` kick '' momentum is accumulated during the final stages of coalescence , on a rapid time ",
    "scale @xcite , hence a snapshot of the disk at @xmath23 outside @xmath24 should still describe the disk around the kicked binary .",
    "prior to @xmath23 , the torques from the binary may create a central cavity nearly devoid of gas within the radius @xmath25 ( for a nearly equal  mass binary , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a narrower gap around the orbit of the lower  mass bh in the case of unequal masses @xmath26 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the lower  mass hole will `` usher '' the gas inward as its orbit decays , so by the time of coalescence , this gas may accrete onto the more massive bh , again leaving a nearly empty central cavity of radius @xmath22 .    in the inner regions of a disk around a supermassive bh",
    ", the dominant vertical support is expected to be radiation pressure ( as opposed to gas pressure ) , and electron scattering dominates the opacity over absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite presented an explicit model for a circumbinary disk with a central cavity , for the case of a nearly equal - mass binary at @xmath23 .",
    "they find , under the above conditions for the inner disk ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28^{0.42},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the total bhb mass @xmath30 in units of @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath33 is the effective @xmath21parameter relating the kinematic viscosity to the gas ( not total ) pressure , @xmath34 is the mass accretion rate at @xmath35 in units of the eddington rate @xmath36 ( i.e. the accretion rate that would produce the eddington luminosity with the radiative efficiency @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 is the mass ratio ( note that we neglect here the dependence on additional dimensionless coefficients of order unity ) .",

    "the expected radial profile of such a disk outside @xmath35 was discussed by @xcite . in the stable case considered by @xcite , when the viscosity is proportional to the gas ( rather than the total ) pressure , the mid  plane temperature and density , and surface density vary with radius as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the ratio of gas / total pressure varies as @xmath45 ( in the limit of @xmath46 ) . inside the transition radius where @xmath47 , @xmath48 the scale height @xmath49 is constant , or @xmath50 ( here @xmath51 relates the kinematic viscosity to the total pressure ) .",
    "this further assumes that the disk is optically thick . beyond @xmath52 ,",
    "gas pressure becomes dominant for vertical support , and the scale  height begins to rise as @xmath53 .",
    "somewhat farther out , beyond @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 ) , the disk will become self  gravitating and subject to toomre  instability .",
    "there are both theoretical and observational reasons to suspect that disks in real agn extend to larger radii ( goodman 2003 ; blaes 2007 ) .",
    "however , note that the orbital time ",
    "scale at this radius is @xmath562 years , so that in the context of prompt _ lisa _ counterparts , we are not interested in radii outside this annulus .    to summarize , based on the above , we adopt the following simplified picture for the disk around a fiducial @xmath57 binary .",
    "the disk has an inner edge at @xmath58 ( inside which it is empty ) and an outer edge at @xmath59 ( outside which there may still be gas , but it evolves slowly and we do not follow it ) . the scale  height and temperature at the inner edge is @xmath60 and @xmath61k , respectively . the scale  height remains constant with radius out to @xmath62 , beyond which it increases nearly linearly ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the temperature varies with radius as @xmath42 .",
    "the important features of such a disk ( as well as other proposed variants of @xmath21-disks ) are the following : ( i ) orbital motions in thin disks are supersonic ( pringle 1981 ) , so that the gas is susceptible to shocks if disturbed ; ( ii ) at the relevant radii outside @xmath63 the viscous time ",
    "scale is long , so that the orbits are near keplerian ; ( iii ) gas near the inner edge of disk is tightly bound to the kicked bhb ( @xmath64 km / s ) , but the outer edge ( @xmath65 km / s ) can be marginally bound , or even unbound , for large kicks ( the approximate condition for being bound is @xmath66 ) , and ( iv ) the total disk mass within @xmath59 is much less than the bhb mass , which justifies ignoring the inertia of the gas bound to the bhb .",
    "for a quantitative assessment of the disk s response to the kick , we employ the following approximation : the disk particles are assumed to be massless , collisionless , and initially on co - planar , circular orbits .",
    "the kick simply adds the velocity @xmath67 to the instantaneous orbital velocity of each particle ( in the inertial frame centered on the bhb ) .",
    "we used @xmath68 particles , distributed randomly and uniformly along the two  dimensional surface of the disk .",
    "the kick velocity was varied between @xmath69 , and directed either perpendicular or parallel to the initial disk plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : spirals ] shows , as an example , a face  on view of the surface density of the disk @xmath70 days after a kick with @xmath71 in the plane of the disk ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the sharp , tightly wound spiral features clearly seen in the figure trace the locus of points where particles cross each other , corresponding formally to a density caustic .",
    "the spiral caustic first forms at @xmath73days , and then propagates outward at a speed of @xmath74 . this behavior can be roughly understood as follows : at a given radius @xmath75 , the caustic forms at the time @xmath76 when the radial epicyclic motions from two neighboring annuli , separated by the epicyclic amplitude @xmath77 , overlap ( this predicts @xmath78 ) .",
    "we also found that as @xmath1 is increased , the spiral caustics spread farther out .",
    "eventually , for kicks strong enough so that a significant fraction of the disk is unbound , the caustics loose their coherent spiral patterns , and develop complex two  dimensional shapes .    figure  [ fig : sombrero ] shows a side view of the 3d particle density one week after a kick with the velocity @xmath79 perpendicular to the disk ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the density profile in this case remains azimuthally symmetric , but still develops concentric rings of density fluctuations .",
    "the important difference from the parallel kick case is that the density enhancements are much weaker ( at the ten percent level ) . by examining the time  evolving radial cross  sections , we have verified that sharp density enhancements , i.e. true caustics caused by the orbit  crossing of particles , first appear only after one year , and involve a smaller fraction of the disk particles .    more generally , kicks can be expected to occur in a direction intermediate between the two extremes shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : spirals ] and [ fig : sombrero ] . following a kick at an arbitrary inclination angle ,",
    "each particle still remains on a kepler orbit .",
    "each new orbit will follow an ellipse in a plane that is tilted by an angle of order between @xmath81 about the axis connecting the instantaneous position of the particle with the central bhb . hence ,",
    "after an orbital time , the particles of the disk will be smeared vertically , effectively thickening the original disk .",
    "the two  dimensional simulations we performed do not conclusive tell us a critical kick inclination angle for prompt density caustics to be produced  this would require three  dimensional simulations , following the orbits of particles in a 3d disk of finite thickness .",
    "however , since the prompt , strong density enhancements appear to develop in the plane of the kick , near the inner edge of the disk , one may conjecture that this critical inclination angle is given roughly by @xmath82 ( with @xmath60 evaluated at @xmath35 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : angles ] , we show the distribution of kick angles , taken from sb07 , assuming that both spins are randomly oriented . we require",
    "further that the component of @xmath1 within the orbital plane exceed @xmath83 ( @xmath84 the sound speed ; see justification in   [ sec : discuss ] below ) .",
    "a strong kick within the orbital plane is produced if the spins are large and parallel to the angular momentum , but anti  aligned with each other .    the main conclusion to draw from figure  [ fig : angles ]",
    "is that caustic ",
    "producing kicks are not rare  in the cases shown in the panels , they occur at least a few percent of the cases .",
    "this conclusion remains true unless ( i ) the spins of the bhs is significantly below the maximal kerr value ( @xmath85 ) , or ( ii ) the spins are significantly aligned with each other .",
    "the latter may be expected if the spin of both bhs results from accretion from the same disk @xcite .",
    "the criteria defined above for producing caustics may turn out very conservative .",
    "for example , prompt caustics could develop when particles from different layers of the disk cross along their orbits . a plausible weaker criterion for shocks",
    "is that the kick  induced tilts of the orbits do not thicken the disk beyond its original scale  height .",
    "apart from trigonometric factors of order unity that describe its azimuthal dependence , the tilt angle is given by @xmath86 ; requiring only @xmath87 , or @xmath88 , density caustics could arise even for nearly perpendicular kicks . in follow  up work , we will employ three  dimensional simulations , to clarify the relevant caustic formation criterion .",
    "the main result of this _ letter _ is that strong density enhancements can form promptly after a supersonic kick in the plane of the circumbinary disk , within a few weeks of the coalescence of a @xmath89 bhb . because the disk is cold , and caustics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spirals ] ) are formed when particles first cross each other along their orbits , this implies that corresponding shocks could occur in a gas disk . for hydrodynamical shocks to occur within a finite  pressure gas , the relative motions @xmath90 between the neighboring particles that produce",
    "the caustic must exceed the sound speed . at the outermost radius where the disk is marginally bound to the bhb , one expects @xmath91 ; relative motions will be slower further inside .",
    "the relative speed should roughly correspond to covering the epicyclic amplitude @xmath92 in the caustic  formation time @xmath93 , yielding @xmath94 . for @xmath95 ,",
    "this predicts @xmath96 ; we have verified in our simulations that particles cross the caustics with speeds at about @xmath97 above this predicted value .",
    "compared with the sound speed @xmath98 , this suggests that the density waves produced by the kick in the gas beyond @xmath99 will indeed steepen into shocks .",
    "we also found that the inclination of the kick may be important in determining the strength and timing of such shocks  perpendicular kicks would only produce weaker density enhancements , at least until a delay of about a year .",
    "a non  negligible fraction ( @xmath6 several % ) of kicks could , however , be sufficiently large and well aligned with the orbital plane for shocks to be produced within a few weeks after coalescence .",
    "the nature of the emission resulting from the shocks or density enhancements will have to be addressed in future work , by computing the heating rate at the spiral shocks , and modeling the overall disk structure and vertical radiation transport .",
    "however , the disk s luminosity resulting from the kick , @xmath100 could be a non  negligible fraction of the bhb s eddington luminosity , and therefore potentially observable ( kocsis et al .",
    "if @xmath101 is the mass of the shocked gas that is heated to temperatures corresponding to @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is the time ",
    "scale on which the corresponding thermal energy is converted to photons , then @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "we may also speculate on the spectral evolution of the `` kick after ",
    "glow '' . assuming @xmath106 ( with @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the epicyclic amplitude ) , and @xmath109",
    ", we find @xmath110 .",
    "this suggests that the luminosity may be dominated by the outermost shocked shells .",
    "the spectrum will then peak at the characteristic photon energy corresponding to @xmath111 .",
    "the shocks could therefore result in an afterglow , starting from @xmath112 days , first peaking in the uv band ( @xmath113ev ) , and then hardening to the soft x  ray ( @xmath8ev ) range after one year .",
    "the detection of such an afterglow would help identify em counterparts to gw sources discovered by _",
    "our results need to be verified in three ",
    "dimensional simulations that resolve the orbits within a finite disk thickness .",
    "a realistic disk model , incorporating gas dynamics , is needed to study the correspondence between collisionless caustics and gaseous shocks .",
    "finally , the sb07 formula needs to be confirmed for generic spin configurations .",
    "nevertheless , our results do suggest that kicks due to gravitational waves may produce a prompt em signal .",
