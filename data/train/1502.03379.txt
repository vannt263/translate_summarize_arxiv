    "although phylogenetic network models built in the study of viral and plant evolution are often nearly stable , it is interesting to know whether the tcp is polynomial time solvable or not for networks with other weak properties .    in particular , the problem remains open for binary networks with the visibility property , but the upper bound we have presented on the number of reticulation vertices of such networks , as well as our algorithm for nearly stable phylogenetic networks , provide definitely valuable ideas to solve the problem , exactly or heuristically , on phylogenetic networks with the reticulation visibility property .",
