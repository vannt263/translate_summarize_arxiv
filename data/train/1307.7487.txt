    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) , we first prove that @xmath129 , where @xmath130 denotes the concurrence of @xmath28 defined by @xmath131^{1/2}$ ] for pure states and convex roof for mixed states . </S>",
    "<S> consider an arbitrary pure state @xmath109 with @xmath110 being its schmidt coefficients , we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the minimal ensemble realization for @xmath130 is @xmath114 . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath148 $ ] , we have a lower bound of eof for the state , @xmath149 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussions and conclusions. _ some generalizations can be made for the above results . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the entanglement witness eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ew ] ) can be viewed as continuous - variable version of ew shown in ref . </S>",

    "<S> besides , it is worth noticing that the ew @xmath153 can be generalized as @xmath154 , where @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) are real ( imaginary ) parts of @xmath12 and @xmath159 , respectively , and @xmath160 is bijective a map @xmath161 . </S>",

    "<S> , the cvloos may have many other applications . </S>",
    "<S> for example , authors of ref . @xcite have proposed a necessary and sufficient condition of nonzero quantum discord using loos for discrete variables . </S>",
    "<S> using cvloos , one can also get a necessary and sufficient condition of nonzero quantum discord for continuous variables as well . </S>",
    "<S> luo has introduced a measure quantifying quantum uncertainty based on skew information and loos @xcite , the measure can probably be extended to continuous variables using cvloos . </S>",
    "<S> these potential applications will be of further research interest .    in conclusion , we present a family of entanglement witnesses based on loos for continuous - variable systems , which are used to detect entanglement of gaussian and non - gaussian states . </S>",
    "<S> we present the realignment criterion for gaussian states which is equivalent to our entanglement witness with optimal choice of cvloos . using the realignment criterion , </S>",
    "<S> we detect bound entanglement in a class of @xmath0 mode gaussian state . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , lower bounds of entanglement measures for arbitrary two - mode continuous - variable states are also proposed .    </S>",
