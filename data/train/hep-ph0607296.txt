    "to test a model of particle physics we must be able to describe the distribution of particles it predicts .",
    "only a fully exclusive distribution is truly useful , since in order to obtain a meaningful comparison between theory and experiment , the theory must undergo a detector simulation and be subjected to the same cuts as the experimental data .",
    "however , high energy colliders produce events with thousands of particles in each event .",
    "there is no easy way to describe even the phase space for such complicated final states , and therefore monte carlo simulations have become essential for the analysis of every high energy experiment .",
    "practically speaking , the current generation of monte carlo tools has been able to reproduce the standard model remarkably well .",
    "but with the onset of the lhc , new energy scales and new kinematical configurations , such as events with many high @xmath0 jets , may appear , and these tools will be pushed beyond their validity .",
    "so it is our task to help these simulations incorporate as much information from analytical calculations as possible , including loop corrections and the cancellation of infrared divergences when appropriate , while still having them produce exclusive events .",
    "the problem with current techniques is that a number of not necessarily good approximations are forced by practical considerations .",
    "for example , it is unreasonable to calculate the analytic expression for a thousand - particle amplitude , and so event generators resort to the parton shower approximation .",
    "this approximation starts with an event resulting in , say , two quarks .",
    "these quarks then branch into quarks and gluons , and evolve down in energy until they hadronize at some low infrared ( ir ) scale .",
    "the branching is treated as a classical markov process with emissions governed by splitting functions derived in the strict collinear limit ; thus any quantum mechanical interference effects are lost .",
    "a lot of work has gone into improving the results from monte carlo simulations .",
    "mostly , it has been directed towards incorporating higher order qcd effects to improve the distributions in regions where the parton shower can not be trusted . and ,",
    "generally , quite good agreement with data has been achieved .",
    "however , it remains an extremely important open question to estimate the errors in these techniques , and to be able to reduce those errors systematically .",
    "it goes without saying that comparing theoretical predictions to data , or comparing the output of different monte carlo schemes , is not the ideal method of estimating error when searching for new physics .",
    "part of the difficulty in simulating qcd is that it becomes strongly coupled at large distances .",
    "but even when qcd is weakly coupled , there is not an obvious perturbation expansion .",
    "of course , we can expand a differential cross section as @xmath1 but when there are multiple scales in the event , such as the relative momentum of pairs of final state partons , large logarithms may appear at any order . typically , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is some kinematical variable , and @xmath4 is a fixed reference scale , such as the center - of - mass energy of the collision .",
    "even if @xmath5 we may have @xmath6 and so the perturbation expansion breaks down . in this case , the large logarithms need to be resummed .",
    "parton showers do this resummation , but without the right framework , it is easy to lose track of which terms are accounted for and which are not .",
    "the right framework is an effective field theory which can sum the logarithms , incorporate finite @xmath7 corrections , and be extended with power corrections to fully reproduce qcd to any desired accuracy .",
    "such an effective theory description was introduced in  @xcite , and in this work we will give more details and expand on that approach .    an effective theory for",
    "event generation should not disturb the infrared properties of qcd , where strong dynamics and hadronization take place .",
    "infrared divergences in qcd , such as a logarithmic dependence on the jet resolution scale , can be physical and must be reproduced .",
    "these divergences are either soft , for example , when a gluon s energy goes to zero , or collinear , such as when a quark emits a possibly hard gluon in almost the same direction .",
    "the effective theory with all these properties is the soft collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite . in this paper , we show how scet can be implemented in an event generator so that the results are systematically improvable .",
    "we will demonstrate how at leading order , scet is equivalent to the traditional parton shower approach .",
    "parton showers write the probability for a branching as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a splitting function and @xmath10 a sudakov factor @xmath11 the splitting function represents the probability of a parton to split , and the sudakov factor accounts for the fact that if a parton splits at a scale @xmath12 , it should not have already split .",
    "we will see the splitting function derived from collinear emissions in scet and the sudakov factor reproduced from renormalization group ( rg ) evolution .",
    "one of the important facts of qcd , which gives rise to parton showers and which allows monte carlo techniques simulate multiple branchings , is that a given cross section factors into a product of probabilities , namely the probability to create an initial final state , multiplied by the probabilities to have subsequent splittings .",
    "this will rederived from scet .",
    "besides justifying the parton shower approach , scet can be used to improve it .",
    "the problem of how to properly combine qcd matrix elements with parton showers is first cast in the language of scale separation . when the logarithms appearing in the differential cross section are large , the scales are widely separated , and the effective theory can be matched at the higher energy scale , and run down to the lower scale .",
    "the splitting functions used in the parton shower describe the long distance behavior of qcd ( and of scet ) , while the short distance physics is different in the two theories .",
    "although the short distance physics of qcd is not fundamentally part of scet , it can be fully reproduced through a consistent matching procedure .",
    "thus scet is valid at all scales , in contrast to qcd or the parton shower separately .",
    "we would like this paper to be self - contained and generally readable by both scet and the monte carlo communities , as well as people familiar with neither field .",
    "so we attempt to incorporate a terse and incomplete review of event generators in section  [ sec : eventgenerators ] and of scet at the beginning of section  [ sec : details ] and in appendix  [ app : scet ] . section  [ sec : schematic ] gives a schematic presentation of the general idea of event generation in scet .",
    "as much as possible , we sequester the detailed calculations to section  [ sec : details ] , which is the heart of the paper .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : details ] are applied in various ways in section  [ sec : comp ] .",
    "we show first how sudakov factors are reproduced from the renormalization group in scet .",
    "a discussion is included of next - to - leading log resummation .",
    "we then discuss how the splitting functions and the factorization of successive branchings are understood from scet .",
    "next , we explore nlo effects , which include the cancellation of infrared divergences in physical observables .",
    "finally , we use the scet results to calculate some observables from parton - level results .",
    "we present the thrust distribution for 3-partons states , and the 2-jet fraction @xmath13 .",
    "section  [ sec : algorithm ] first summarizes how differential cross - sections are calculated , and then describes a simple algorithm that can use these cross section to distribute events in a monte carlo program .",
    "finally we present our conclusions and outlook .",
    "we also include in appendix  [ app : kin ] some kinematical relations and conventions that are used throughout the paper .",
    "in this section we review some aspects of how parton showers and event generators work , with an eye towards comparing to the scet approach .",
    "this section contains no new information , and readers familiar with the subject can safely skip this section .    an event is typically generated in three phases  @xcite .",
    "first a simple hard process is selected at the parton level , with a probability proportional to its production cross section calculated using standard feynman diagram methods .",
    "second , the partons , which are taken to be highly off - shell at the hard scale , radiate additional partons and `` evolve '' down until their off - shellness reaches a low scale , which is typically chosen to be of order 1 gev .",
    "finally , the partons hadronize using some confinement model .",
    "we will be concerned here mainly with the second stage , the parton shower , and its interplay with the other two .",
    "parton showers use classical evolution to describe the emissions of particles : they assign a probability for one particle to split in two .",
    "this probability depends on two kinematical variables .",
    "the first variable , @xmath12 , is chosen to be a measure of the virtuality of the initial particle , and tends to zero if the two final particles are collinear .",
    "the second variable , @xmath14 , measures the relative energy between the two final particles . using that the splitting is independent of azimuthal angle , and that the branching probability is linearly divergent as @xmath12 goes to zero , the probability is proportional to @xmath15 up to terms of order @xmath16",
    "here , @xmath9 is our notation , while @xmath17 is the traditional spin averaged splitting function , with @xmath18 indexing the final state particles .",
    "for example , the quark splitting function in qcd is @xmath19 where @xmath20 .    in order to calculate the classical probability of an initial particle with virtuality @xmath21 to branch at a particular value @xmath22 , one needs to include the probability that no branching has occurred at a larger value of @xmath12 .",
    "this is similar to the well known case of nuclear beta decay , where this no - branching probability is responsible for the exponential decay rate .",
    "the probability of no - emission from @xmath21 to @xmath22 is then given by an integral , known as a sudakov factor @xmath23)}{2 \\pi } p_{ab}(z)\\right )   \\label{sud}\\ ] ] here , the scale @xmath24 at which @xmath7 is evaluated can depend on both @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "as an example , consider a quark - antiquark pair with virtuality @xmath4 . the probability that a branching occurs at a scale @xmath12 is given by the probability that neither quark branched at a scale greater than @xmath12 , times the probability for either of the two to branch at that scale .",
    "thus the differential cross section to have three final state partons is given by the cross section for two final state particles , multiplied by a sudakov factor and the sum of the two splitting functions for quark and antiquark emission @xmath25\\ , .",
    "\\label{dsps}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the equivalent of @xmath27 for the antiquark emission .",
    "parton showers rely on two crucial assumptions .",
    "first , one neglects the interference between the emissions off the various particles , and second , the intermediate states are taken onshell when deriving the splitting functions .",
    "for example , in the emission of a gluon off a quark - antiquark pair , the square of the full matrix element in qcd is replaced by a sum of two independent emission graphs @xmath28 both of these assumptions can be justified in the limit @xmath29 , which implies that the virtuality of the branching particle is small compared to its energy . in that limit",
    "the branching particle becomes almost on - shell and the interference between the two qcd diagrams becomes subdominant .",
    "note that the two diagrams on the right hand side are not gauge invariant and thus not well - defined .",
    "the parton shower circumvents this problem by summing only over physical polarizations , which restores gauge invariance , _ ipso facto_. the splitting functions are well defined because the residue of the pole is gauge invariant and does not get a contribution from interference .",
    "but the @xmath16 and higher order pieces depend on conventions .",
    "for example , take the square of the relative transverse momentum between the two final state particles , @xmath30 , as the measure of the virtuality @xmath12 .",
    "the branching probability is then proportional to @xmath9 with @xmath31 .",
    "now consider the different choice @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the invariant mass of the two final state particles @xmath34 .",
    "these two variables are related by @xmath35 using this to change variables in @xmath36 , we reproduce the same pole terms as in @xmath37 , however the higher order terms differ",
    ". thus we can not define the higher order terms in splitting functions in a consistent way .    from the discussion",
    "so far we have learned that parton showers give simple expressions for the emission of partons .",
    "these can easily be turned into powerful computer algorithms using monte carlo techniques , which can be used to generate final states with many partons .",
    "one starts with a cross section for a process with a limited number of particles in the final state . in practice ,",
    "event generators often start with processes with only two final state partons .",
    "the virtuality of these two partons is chosen to be comparable to the hard scale of the interaction @xmath4 , and all additional partons in the final state are generated by the classical probabilities of particles to split into two particles with lower virtuality .",
    "this can be cast in a markov chain process , evolving the system from high to low virtuality , adding additional particles through the splitting functions .",
    "different parton shower algorithms all use the physics described above , but they differ in which next - to - leading order effects they incorporate .",
    "first , they use different choices for the evolution variable @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "second , they use different choices for the scale @xmath24 at which @xmath38 is evaluated in .",
    "finally , for each emission in a parton shower , @xmath14 and @xmath12 are distributed over phase space assuming that the partons are on shell .",
    "but subsequent branchings require the partons to be off shell , so there is an ambiguity in how to assign the kinematics  @xcite .",
    "all of these effects only contribute at next - to - leading order , but they can give rise to considerable differences between the different programs in certain cases .",
    "another aspect of qcd that has to be taken into account carefully arises for the emission of a soft parton  @xcite .",
    "the analog of the chudakov effect from qed is that , when integrated over azimuth , soft emissions at large angle are sensitive only to the aggregate color charge of all the contributing partons .",
    "the result is that large angle soft emissions are suppressed .",
    "this is generally incorporated into parton showers by either using an evolution variable which corresponds to angle ( as in herwig  @xcite ) or by explicitly vetoing emissions which are not angular ordered ( as in some versions of pythia  @xcite ) .",
    "the assumptions of parton showers restrict their validity to regions of phase space where each successive emission has to have virtuality much smaller than any previous one , @xmath39 regions of phase space with @xmath40 are only correctly described by the full qcd matrix elements .",
    "thus , only an event generator which combines both the full qcd matrix elements with the parton showers will yield predictions which are correct to a given fixed order in perturbation theory , while also summing the leading logarithms correctly and allowing for the additional production of partons with small transverse momenta .",
    "several techniques have been developed which allow such a combination of qcd matrix elements with parton showers , including original work which has been implemented in pythia and herwig  @xcite and some more recent developments  @xcite .",
    "one popular example is the ckkw procedure  @xcite , which provides a way to combine tree level qcd matrix elements with parton shower evolution .",
    "the idea is to compute the exact tree - level qcd matrix element for an event , including interference , but with a lower cutoff @xmath41 on the virtuality between any two particles .",
    "one then reconstructs the dominant diagram using the @xmath42 algorithm  @xcite and reweights the event by multiplying with appropriate sudakov factors .",
    "parton showers are then added to these matrix elements , vetoing all emissions with @xmath43 .",
    "this avoids double counting between the emissions contained in the qcd matrix elements and those generated by the parton showers .",
    "this algorithm has been tested against data , and overall the procedure seems to work very well  @xcite .",
    "a truly accurate next - to - leading order calculation would also incorporate loop diagrams . to obtain the matrix elements at nlo",
    "requires calculating the one loop correction to the lowest order matrix element and combining it with the matrix element which describes the radiation of one additional parton .",
    "the difficulty in going to nlo is that both the virtual contributions at one loop and the real emission have infrared divergences , which only cancel when both diagrams are combined to calculate an infrared safe observable  @xcite , and this cancellation is difficulty to encode numerically .",
    "mc@nlo  @xcite provides one solution ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it uses the fact that the first splitting in the parton shower reproduces the ir divergence of the real qcd emission , and can thus be used to devise a subtraction from both the real and virtual diagrams that render both these contributions finite .",
    "this yields two separate matrix elements , which are both finite and can be used as starting conditions for a traditional parton shower .",
    "the initial results appear promising  @xcite .",
    "one problem is that mc@nlo works at the level of cross sections , not matrix elements , so it runs up against the possibility of having negative weights .",
    "it is also not clear how to generalize the procedure to higher orders .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the traditional monte carlo method uses splitting functions and sudakov factors to generate a fully showered event .",
    "an event generator typically starts with an underlying hard process calculated using matrix elements of the full theory .",
    "the splitting functions then generate additional partons from these simple final states . the sudakov factor , which is the probability of no - branching , is included , and it resums the large logarithms at leading order .",
    "the traditional monte carlo method uses splitting functions and sudakov factors to generate a fully showered event .",
    "both splitting functions and sudakov factors can be derived in the limit of small transverse momentum , and parton showers are only correct in the limit where each successive branching has @xmath0 much smaller that any previous branching : @xmath44 thus , only events with widely separated momentum scales can be described using parton shower techniques .",
    "the occurrence of these widely separated scales makes it natural to reformulate the problem in the language of effective field theory .",
    "the appropriate effective theory for this problem is the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) , which is designed to reproduce exactly long distance physics in the limit of collinear or soft radiation .",
    "scet is a simplified version of qcd where only collinear and soft degrees of freedom are kept and all others have been integrated out .",
    "any calculation using effective field theories requires three steps .",
    "first , one needs to match the effective theory onto the underlying theory .",
    "matching determines coefficients in the effective theory such that at some short distance scale it exactly reproduces the underlying theory .",
    "this ensures that the effective theory below that scale contains the same information as the underlying theory .",
    "the scale for this matching calculation is typically chosen to coincide with the hard scale in the problem , for example the center of mass energy of the collision .",
    "this ensures that the resulting short distance coefficients do not contain any large logarithms .",
    "second , the effective theory is evolved to the lower scales arising in the process one wants to describe .",
    "this is achieved technically using renormalization group ( rg ) evolution , which sums logarithmic terms of the ratio of the low to the high scale .",
    "finally , the matrix elements of the operators in the effective theory are calculated at the low scale .    as we will show in this paper",
    ", these steps naturally correspond to the ingredients in traditional parton showers mentioned above .",
    "the matching calculation encodes the hard underlying process which we want to study .",
    "the solution to the rg evolution gives rise to evolution kernels , which are equivalent to appropriate combinations of sudakov factors .",
    "and the resulting matrix elements in scet have the property that in the collinear limit their squares simplify to squares of simpler operators , multiplied by the splitting functions of qcd .",
    "the first step is to match the full theory onto the effective theory at the hard scale @xmath4 . to match ,",
    "we introduce operators in scet and choose their coefficients such that the matrix elements in qcd and scet are the same",
    ". the matching can be done perturbatively in @xmath7 to any order .",
    "once we have matched at the hard scale , we no longer need qcd . to be more specific ,",
    "consider the process @xmath45 hadrons .",
    "in the standard model , this is mediated by a current @xmath46 where @xmath47 in the case of an intermediate photon or @xmath48 if the @xmath49 boson is included .",
    "the current has a non - vanishing matrix element in many final states , and we can compute @xmath50 for any number of partons . in scet ,",
    "the process is mediated by operators which are constructed out of the fundamental objects of scet : soft and collinear gluons , collinear quarks , and wilson lines .",
    "wilson lines are required to ensure gauge invariance of scet , and each collinear field needs to be multiplied with wilson lines in the appropriate su(3 ) representation .",
    "for example , collinear fermions and collinear gluons always come in the combinations @xmath51 w_n^\\dagger\\ , .",
    "\\label{cadef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the scet literature @xmath52 is commonly written as @xmath53 .    to reproduce the production of two collinear back - to - back partons",
    "one requires an operator in scet which contains two collinear fields , one for each of the directions : @xmath54 each operator comes with a set of labels , corresponding to the directions @xmath55 of its collinear fields .",
    "we write @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the label momenta .",
    "the labels identify the degrees of freedom which can not change  all the hard degrees of freedom which could have changed the collinear momentum in the full theory are integrated out of scet .",
    "note that there can be many operators with the same labels but different tensor structure ( for example , the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 we will define later on ) . for notational simplicity",
    ", we will often omit the labels @xmath60 when there is no ambiguity .",
    "the matching between qcd and scet implies that we want to choose coefficients @xmath61 for these operators such that the sum over all the operators reproduces the current of qcd @xmath62 since the wilson coefficients @xmath61 only encode short distance physics , they are independent of the choice of states used in the calculation of matrix elements .",
    "so , to satisfy this equation , we can take matrix elements in convenient states , and build up the @xmath61 systematically .",
    "first , we take matrix elements with two quarks in the final state , which gives the matching condition @xmath63 as no other higher order operators have matrix elements in a 2-quark state .",
    "this allows us to determine @xmath64 .",
    "next , we take matrix elements with two quarks and one gluon @xmath65 and allows us to determine @xmath66 .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath61 with @xmath67 are determined analogously . in order to correctly match qcd with up to",
    "@xmath68 well separated partons requires operators @xmath69 with @xmath70 in scet .",
    "the next step is running .",
    "the matching determines the wilson coefficients at the matching scale , @xmath71 and the running will allow us to obtain them at a lower scales .",
    "the wilson coefficients at these two scales are related by @xmath72 the calculation of the evolution kernel @xmath73 is a straightforward application of the renormalization group , and involves calculating the anomalous dimensions of the operators in scet . because the interactions in scet are simpler than in qcd , the anomalous dimensions are fairly easy to compute .",
    "in fact , we will compute a closed form , algebraic expression , for the ll anomalous dimension of any @xmath69 .",
    "the interactions in scet allow for collinear gluons to be radiated off collinear quarks and gluons , or collinear gluons to split into two collinear quarks .",
    "however , since scet only describes the collinear or soft limit of qcd , the transverse momentum between the resulting particles has to be small .",
    "how small depends on the renormalization scale at which the emission is calculated , and the requirement is typically @xmath74 . as an example consider the matrix element of @xmath75 in an three parton final state with specific momenta @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the transverse momentum of the gluon with respect to a quark .",
    "is scet notation for the perpendicular momentum label on a collinear field , while @xmath0 refers to the transverse momentum between two four - vectors . ]",
    "if the renormalization scale satisfies @xmath77 , then gluon emission in scet can give rise to a gluon in the final state , and a non - vanishing matrix element .",
    "if , however , @xmath78 , then the scet emission is not able to produce a gluon in the final state , and the matrix element of @xmath75 vanishes .    for theory to be continuous across @xmath0 , matrix elements at the scale @xmath79 must be equal to matrix elements at @xmath80 .",
    "more precisely , we require that @xmath81_{\\mu = p_t + \\epsilon } =   [ { { \\mathrm c } } _ 2 \\langle { { \\mathcal o}}_2 \\rangle + { { \\mathrm c } } _ 3 \\langle { { \\mathcal o}}_3 \\rangle + \\cdots ] _ { \\mu = p_t - \\epsilon}\\ ] ] to compensate for the discontinuity of @xmath82 at @xmath83 , we only need to change @xmath84 ; all other matrix elements are continuous across the threshold .",
    "so we derive the matching condition @xmath85_{\\mu = p_t+\\epsilon}= [ { { \\mathrm c } } _ 3 \\langle{{\\mathcal o}}_3^{(2 ) } \\rangle ] _ { \\mu = p_t-\\epsilon}\\,.\\ ] ] we call this matching threshold matching and it is done wholly within scet .",
    "note that the operator @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ thresholdmatching ] ) is different from the operator @xmath58 arising in the hard matching at @xmath86 . to distinguish these operators we add a superscript , which labels the number of partons present at the hard matching scale . for simplicity ,",
    "we omit the superscript for the operators matched at @xmath4 : @xmath87 .",

    "using the feynman rules in scet we will show later that emissions in scet factorize .",
    "in particular , @xmath93 where @xmath94 . the function @xmath95 is equivalent to a splitting function of qcd , up to power corrections , in the collinear limit .",
    "we can now show that scet agrees with qcd for large @xmath0 and the parton shower for small @xmath0 .",
    "first , consider the limit @xmath96 . then , @xmath97 up to higher order corrections .",
    "so eq .   reduces to eq .",
    "and we reproduce qcd .",
    "next , take the limit @xmath98 .",
    "then we are in the collinear limit , and so the matrix element of @xmath75 is very similar to that of qcd .",

    "there are several issues that have to be resolved before we can use the above results to determine the matching of the operator @xmath58 .",
    "first , note that the collinear emission from a wilson line gives a divergence if the large label momentum ( @xmath150 for @xmath151 and @xmath152 for @xmath153 ) becomes small . in scet ,",
    "the collinear phase space integration involves summing over the large momentum labels , as well as integrating over the residual part of the momentum . however , in the sum over collinear momenta the value @xmath154 and @xmath155 has to be omitted  @xcite .",
    "thus , the phase space integration will never reach a value for the label momentum such that the unphysical divergence is realized .",
    "however , keeping track of the condition @xmath156 in the phase space integration can be difficult , and we therefore propose a scheme which will allow us to integrate the phase space naively , without having to worry about small label momenta . in this scheme one",
    "neglects the emissions from the collinear wilson lines all together , and ensures gauge invariance by summing over only transverse polarizations when squaring the resulting matrix elements . by neglecting the @xmath157 contributions",
    ", we subtract the divergences at small @xmath158 .",
    "any appropriate prescription will modify the effective theory only at short distances , and therefore differences in prescription can be absorbed by appropriately adjusting the wilson coefficients in the matching condition . in practice , however , we have to evaluate matrix elements at finite momenta , which are neither exactly at the hard scale where the matching is done , nor in the strict collinear limit , where the different prescriptions coincide .",
    "therefore the physical results may differ . however , these differences are beyond leading order in the scet expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ they are power corrections .",
    "the second issue is that emissions in scet can not change the directions of the fermions .",
    "since the operators @xmath75 that were matched on in the two jet matching have the two fermions in back - to - back directions , the matrix element of @xmath75 can only give rise to final state with back - to - back fermions .",
    "but if momentum is to be conserved when we include the gluon , the directions of the quark and anti - quark momenta can never satisfy @xmath159 exactly .",
    "this implies that in order to insist on , we need to change the direction of at least one of @xmath160 or @xmath161 using , otherwise we could never get a non - vanishing matrix element with three partons in different directions .",
    "there are again various possibilities to deal with this , and all of them will lead to the same results up to power corrections .",
    "the choice we will adopt here is that directions of collinear fields which are not involved in the emission do not change .",
    "then we rotate the emitting field into the direction of its final state .",
    "in other words , we use @xmath162 \\to   \\overline{\\xi}_{n_q } \\frac{{{\\nslash}}_{{\\bar{q}}}{{\\bnslash}}_{{\\bar{q}}}}{4 }    { { \\omega}}[\\gamma \\xi_{n_{{\\bar{q } } } } ] ,   \\qquad [ \\overline{\\xi}_n \\gamma ]   { { \\omega}}\\xi_{{\\bar{n}}}\\to [ \\overline{\\xi}_{n_q}\\gamma ]   { { \\omega}}\\frac{{{\\bnslash}}_q{{\\nslash}}_q}{4 }   \\xi_{n_{{\\bar{q}}}}\\ , , \\label{jetproj}\\ ] ] where @xmath163 is some arbitrary operator .",
    "this equation shows how to replace a fermion in scet with a fermion in qcd , which is necessary to compare matrix elements in the same external states .",
    "we now see that two _ different _ operators @xmath164 and @xmath165 contribute to the same final state .",
    "pictorially , @xmath166 the first will turns @xmath75 into @xmath167 when the quark emits , and the second when the antiquark emits .",
    "we want to emphasize again that this is just a convention , and equivalent to any other convention up to power corrections .",
    "the transverse momenta are measured with respect to the directions @xmath118 and @xmath168 .",
    "this implies that when the quark emits , @xmath169 and when the antiquark emits , @xmath170 . using these results together with",
    ", the quark emission and antiquark emission contributions to the matrix element of @xmath75 can be simplified to @xmath171    using the results of the scet matrix elements given in eq .   and the qcd matrix elements given in eq .",
    ", their difference reduces to the simple form@xcite @xmath172    the final step in the matching is to choose a basis for the 3-jet operators @xmath173 .",
    "the standard convention is to have @xmath174 at tree level , so we take @xmath175 .",
    "thus , we arrive at @xmath176 where @xmath177 was defined in eq .  .",
    "note that @xmath58 is the difference between the qcd and scet emissions .",
    "since the operator @xmath75 , together with the scet emission of an additional gluon describes the infrared physics of qcd , the operator @xmath58 only has contributions for large values of the transverse momentum",
    ".    if the gluon is soft instead of collinear , there are two emission diagrams in scet .",
    "the matrix elements are @xmath178 this can be compared with the collinear results given our convention of dealing with label momenta going to zero . in that scheme",
    "we only keep the matrix elements @xmath179 and sum only over transverse polarizations of the gluons . taking the soft limit of @xmath180 ( by taking @xmath181 )",
    "we find @xmath182 thus , the soft limit of the collinear lagrangian emission is identical to the soft gluon emission .",
    "however , care has to be taken about the second part of the convention , namely the fact that we only sum over transverse polarizations .",
    "since for gauge invariant amplitudes the longitudinal polarizations do not contribute to physical processes , the soft gauge invariance of scet is enough to ensure that the sum over transverse polarizations is equivalent to the sum over all polarizations .",
    "scet is by construction gauge invariant , but one can also see the invariance trivially from eq .",
    ". replacing @xmath183 , the two contributions are equal and opposite in sign and thus cancel .",
    "thus , the amplitude satisfies the ward identity and is gauge invariant . with these two observations",
    "it is obvious that the collinear emission reproduces the soft emission properly .    in summary",
    ", we have chosen the conventions    * all fields appearing in operators have labels for collinear momenta only ; in our basis , all @xmath132 momentum components are zero .",
    "* emissions are calculated with the collinear emission from the scet lagrangian only .",
    "wilson line emission and soft emission are discarded .",

    "all other conventions are equivalent up to power corrections .",
    "we can outline the calculation for matching 4-jet operators @xmath186 .",
    "these will make up for the difference between what scet predicts when we have used only 3-parton qcd results , and the true 4-parton qcd prediction . starting from @xmath187 ,",
    "a 4-parton state can be either @xmath188 or @xmath189 .",
    "we need to solve @xmath190 let us take the @xmath191 state as an example .",
    "then there are two qcd diagrams which contribute @xmath192 on the scet side , the @xmath75 s can contribute @xmath193 as well as @xmath58 @xmath194 and of course @xmath186 : @xmath195 using the results for @xmath75 and @xmath58 obtained previously , we can determine @xmath196 and @xmath186 . in a similar way , the tree - level matching for @xmath118 jets can be worked out .",

    "the grey band is the nll uncertainty , as in figure  [ fig : thrust].,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the results for this observable are shown in figure  [ fig:2jet ] .",
    "the effect of the sudakov suppression can be seen on the left - side , at small @xmath425 . here",
    ", the tree - level qcd prediction drops below zero , showing that its estimate of @xmath13 is no longer trustworthy .",
    "both the ps and the scet curves are still positive at low energy , implying that they give a better estimate of the 2-jet cross section . for large @xmath425 , the 2-jet rate should be accurately given by qcd .",
    "the ps gets the rate wrong , because it is integrating over hard emission where it is not valid .",
    "the finite difference between the ps and scet curves comes from the integral over large @xmath0 , where the ps can not be trusted .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that scet reproduces parton showers , sudakov suppression , and nlo qcd results , and that it smoothly interpolates between the hard and soft regimes where qcd and parton showers are valid . in this section",
    "we will illustrate how the scet formalism is naturally suited to implementation in an event generator .",
    "it has the capacity to produce particle distributions with several high @xmath0 jets , while summing the leading logarithms . and",
    "it is at least as powerful as parton showers for recursively adding additional soft or collinear partons .",
    "what we are after is the differential cross section @xmath426 for events with an arbitrary number of final states . in an event generator",
    ", this amounts to computing the weight , or probability , of an event , given the kinematics of the particles in the event .",
    "we will review schematically the analytical expressions required and give a simple algorithm to obtain events distributed according to these distributions .      suppose we want the weight for an event with @xmath427 particles from a production process at center of mass energy @xmath4 . to calculate this",
    ", the scet approach requires a sequence of matching and running steps .",
    "first qcd is matched onto scet at the scale @xmath88 by requiring that matrix elements with a given number of particles are correctly reproduced by the effective theory . in practice , how many particles we include depends on the number of matrix elements that it is feasible to compute in full qcd ( and in scet ) .",
    "this will in general be much less than @xmath427 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the maximum number of partons which are matched .",
    "so the matching turns on operators @xmath75 through @xmath428 at @xmath227 .",
    "after the matching , each of the operators is evolved to lower scales using the renormalization group equations . to do this , we need the threshold matching scales , @xmath429 , which can be derived from the event s momenta , for example with the @xmath42 algorithm  @xcite .",
    "so we have @xmath430 . at @xmath431",
    "a threshold matching is performed where the operator @xmath75 is matched onto an operator @xmath59 .",
    "the set of operators is then evolved to the scale @xmath432 , at which scale the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 are matched onto @xmath433 and @xmath344 .",
    "this continues until the scale @xmath24 reaches the scale @xmath434 .",
    "the differential cross section is then ( up to phase space factors ) @xmath435{{\\mathcal o}}_r^{(2 ) } + [ { { \\mathrm c } } _ 3(q ) \\pi_3 \\cdots \\pi_r]{{\\mathcal",
    "o}}_r^{(3 ) } + \\cdots + [ { { \\mathrm c } } _ m(q ) \\pi_m \\cdots \\pi_r ] { { \\mathcal o}}_r^{(m)}\\right|^2\\,.{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that since only operators @xmath69 with @xmath436 were included in the matching onto scet , this expression will only reproduce the full qcd results exactly with up to @xmath68 partons in the final state .",
    "all additional partons are described by radiation in scet thus rely on an expansion in @xmath0 . as we have shown , after squaring the matrix elements , the scet radiation is equivalent to the splitting functions used in parton showers .",
    "so , @xmath437 this distribution will be valid if the @xmath0 satisfy @xmath438 so if we want the distribution for @xmath427 hard jets , we should aim for @xmath439 .",
    "now let us consider how to incorporate these results into an event generator .",
    "this means we need an algorithm for sampling the phase space and unweighting events .",
    "we do not intend to present a complete or ideal solution , but rather sketch one possibility .",
    "suppose that the we have qcd and scet matrix elements for up to @xmath68 partons , then an algorithm might look like    1 .",
    "start with a hadronic event at center - of - mass energy @xmath4 , according to as accurate calculations of total cross sections as are available .",
    "2 .   pick a configuration of @xmath68 partons with probability proportional to @xmath440 in eq .  .",
    "3 .   if the minimum @xmath0 of the configuration , @xmath441 is more than than ir cutoff @xmath442 , then we have an event with @xmath68 or more partons . * start a parton shower at @xmath443 , using the scet rg kernels as sudakov factors .",
    "otherwise , we have an event with less than @xmath68 partons .",
    "[ lessthanm ] 1 .",
    "pick momenta for @xmath444 partons with probability proportional to @xmath445 in eq .  .",
    "2 .   if the minimum @xmath0 of this configuration , @xmath446 is more than the ir cutoff @xmath442 , then we have an event with @xmath447 partons . * do not shower .",
    "go straight to hadronization with this kinematics . or , equivalently , shower starting at @xmath448 .",
    "otherwise , we have an event with less than @xmath447 partons .",
    "return to step ( a ) with @xmath449 .",
    "there are several points worth elaborating on here .",
    "first , note that the differential distributions in scet do not diverge as two partons become collinear or one becomes soft .",
    "this is because we are not using the qcd amplitude and correcting with sudakov factors later on , but using the scet amplitude which has the sudakov suppression built in .",
    "since the sudakov factor vanishes exponentially in either of these limits , it overcomes the linear power divergence present in the full qcd amplitude .",
    "second , although we need to use some type of jet definition to sort the @xmath0 in the kinematics , there will be only a very weak dependence on this definition in the final results .",
    "the strongest dependence on the jet definition should cancel from matching to the hadronization routine .",
    "the detailed sorting of @xmath0 only has an effect on momenta which are strongly ordered , in which case all infrared - safe jet definitions should agree .",
    "there may be a subleading effect , which amounts to power corrections , and is beyond the order we are working .",
    "also note that because the amplitude is finite even for small @xmath0 , we do not need to employ an intermediate jet cutoff scale in the theory , between @xmath4 and @xmath442 .",
    "we emphasize that this algorithm produces fully exclusive events , independent of jet definition . for observables with jets",
    ", the events can be combined using whatever algorithm is desired , and if the same algorithm is used on the data there should be good agreement .",
    "third , if we are working to a consistent order in @xmath7 , the distribution in step [ lessthanm ] should really be done at nlo for @xmath447 partons , and nnlo for @xmath450 partons , _ etc._. as we have shown , all the nlo information from qcd can be reproduced in scet , but one still needs to integrate over the regulated phase space for @xmath68 partons in the singular region to cancel the nlo divergences for the @xmath447 parton event .",
    "quantitatively , the nlo effects are small for the vast majority of observables , so this algorithm as presented should be good for most practical purposes .    finally , the reason we do not just skip step [ lessthanm ] is as follows .",
    "the distribution of @xmath68 partons , from steps 1 through 3 , is as accurate as possible with the information given .",
    "but because of the sudakov suppression , the amplitude to produce fewer than @xmath68 jets is probably very small .",
    "in fact , in steps 1 to 3 , we make a monte carlo estimate of the @xmath68-or - more parton cross section .",
    "the distribution at small @xmath0 is also sensitive to subleading logarithms , and so we probably can not trust it . therefore",
    ", step [ lessthanm ] recalculates the distribution from the hard scale , which should be a better estimate of the @xmath447 parton event shape .",
    "we have shown how to construct an event generator based on effective field theory .",
    "the correct effective theory reproducing all collinear and soft divergences of qcd is scet , and we have shown that scet at leading order it is equivalent to a conventional parton shower .",
    "the advantage over the parton shower is that an effective theory is systematically improvable order - by - order . in particular",
    ", we have shown that by matching scet onto qcd matrix elements with up to three partons allows to obtain cross sections which smoothly merge the parton shower approximation with more accurate matrix elements for events with large transverse momentum .    since we have a consistent effective field theory framework for the shower , we know precisely to what order we are working .",
    "we can therefore estimate errors , and then incorporate higher order corrections if necessary when comparing to data .",
    "there are five places where higher order corrections can be incorporated    1 .   matching to qcd for higher multiplicity matrix elements",
    ". 2 .   matching to qcd at higher loop order .",
    "3 .   higher loop running .",
    "matching within scet across the emission threshold , at higher order .",
    "power corrections from the scet expansion .",
    "the first three we have already discussed at length in this paper . of these the higher loop running may be the most important to work out and implement .",
    "we showed in figures  [ fig : sudaband ] and [ fig : thrust ] an estimate of nll resummation .",
    "it is clearly a large effect for small @xmath0 .",
    "is not necessarily worth doing .",
    "we know that leading order scet , like the parton shower , is best when @xmath451 .",
    "so if two successive emissions occur at similar @xmath0 s , the rate will be untrustworthy .",
    "however , a large @xmath0 emission will appear as another jet , and so we really should do the higher order matching to qcd , as in 1 . and 2 .",
    "to get the rate right . item 5 is certainly important , but it may be prohibitively difficult to implement .",
    "our results were collected in the last two sections , and we have indicated how scet might be used to construct an event generator . we have also investigated the uncertainties in traditional parton showers . for large values of @xmath0 , these uncertainties arise from higher order in @xmath324 , which are not included due to the approximations required to derive parton showers . for small values of @xmath0 on the other hand , the subleading logarithms which are not properly summed in the sudakov factors give rise to large uncertainties as well .",
    "so , parton showers have relatively large uncertainties in most regions of phase space .",
    "thus , while parton showers are very useful to populate phase space of events with many particles , it is very difficult to obtain results with small well defined theoretical uncertainties .",
    "since scet is able to improve the precision in all regions of phase space , we showed how scet might be used to produce events with controllable errors .",
    "our precscription was to produce an initial @xmath68-parton distribution at high accuracy , including resummation of large logarithms within scet , and then to use the parton shower and hadronization routines , which are constrained by unitary , to fill out the jets with particles .",
    "one can go further , for example by using the properties of scet , the accuracy of the shower routines could be improved , in principle , to any accuracy desired .",
    "since effective field theories resum logs and are systematically improvable they have the potential to greatly improve our theoretical understanding of particle distributions .",
    "scet is an effective theory containing only soft and collinear degrees of freedom , which can propagate over long distances . since all long distance physics in massless qcd",
    "is determined by either soft or collinear particles , scet is reproducing the long distance behavior of qcd , while all short distance physics can be encoded in short distance wilson coefficients .",
    "scet is essentially a simplified version of qcd in which all the ir degrees of freedom , that is , the soft and collinear fields , are the same , but the uv structure is simplified . in particular , fields which are neither",
    "soft nor collinear are integrated out .",
    "the notation used in scet emphasizes the nature of the scet fields .",
    "let @xmath452 be a lightlike direction @xmath453 , @xmath454 .",
    "any four - vector can be decomposed with respect to @xmath452 and @xmath455 as @xmath456 so we can define @xmath457 and derive useful identities , such as @xmath458 @xmath459 we also denote the normalized four - vector in the direction of @xmath460 by @xmath461 .",
    "an operator @xmath462 is often used to project out label momenta . for example , @xmath463    a field is colliner to @xmath118 if its momentum satisfies @xmath464 , where @xmath465 is a small number giving the expansion parameter in scet . the momentum of a collinear field scales like @xmath466 , where we have used with @xmath467 .",
    "a field is soft .",
    "these `` soft '' fields are not relevant for the current considerations as they can not interact with either collinear or ultrasoft fields . ]",
    "if its momentum scales like @xmath468 . note that the sum of two collinear momenta in the same direction is collinear , so collinear interactions are allowed .",
    "but if two fields are collinear to different directions , @xmath469 and @xmath470 , they scale differently and interactions are forbidden .",
    "a dirac fermion @xmath471 with momentum @xmath460 can be decomposed into collinear fermions @xmath472 and @xmath161 as @xmath473 the difference betwen @xmath471 and @xmath472 is that on - shell , @xmath471 satisfies @xmath474 while @xmath472 satisfies @xmath475 . when @xmath118 is aligned with @xmath460 , @xmath476 , but in general @xmath477 .",
    "the scet lagrangian is derived from the qcd lagrangian by integrating out the small components @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "then , using the scaling properties of the quarks and soft and collienar gluons , the feynman rules are worked out as an expansion in @xmath465 .",
    "they can be found in @xcite .",
    "scet has the curious property that no information is lost when @xmath161 is integrated out , even if only the first order terms in the @xmath465 expansion are kept .",
    "there are a few ways to see this .",
    "first , note that @xmath478 and @xmath479 are projectors , in that they are orthogonal and complete .",
    "however , we can regain @xmath471 from just @xmath472 or @xmath161 using the identity @xmath480 and that @xmath476 .",
    "one should keep in mind that scet is a boosted version of qcd  @xcite , and any interactions between collinear fiels in the same directions are thus given by full qcd .",
    "whenever there are fields collinear to different directions , however , their interactions will be different from in qcd .",
    "it is in this situation that scet is useful .",
    "since collinear fields in different directions do not interact with one another , there should be a separate collinear gauge invariance for each direction @xmath118 . to ensure this gauge invariance",
    ", however , requires that each collinear fermion is multiplied by a collinear wilson line , making the resulting field gauge invariant by itself @xmath481 each collinear fermion is therefore wrapped in collinear wilson lines , and it is these collinear `` jets '' which are the basic building blocks of operators in scet .",
    "for example , an operator with two jets would be @xmath482 where @xmath208 is some tensor structure .",
    "because @xmath469 and @xmath470 are different labels , no collinear fields can couple to both jets .",
    "collinear gluons can couple one jet to itself , and soft gluons can be exchanged between jets .",
    "diagrams in scet are usually computed in @xmath200 dimensional regularization .",
    "it is also helpful to regulate ir divergences by giving the quarks and gluons small virtualities .",
    "these virtualities must drop out of physical calculations , and it is a helpful check on the theory to show that they do .",
    "sample calculations can be found in  @xcite .",
    "physical quark masses can easily be accounted for in scet  @xcite , but for simplicity we take all fields to be massless .",
    "for the three parton final state , label the momenta of the quark , antiquark and gluon @xmath483 , @xmath484 and @xmath485 , repsectively .",
    "there are two independent invariants we can construct .",
    "however , it is convient to go between a number of kinematic variables .",
    "let @xmath4 be the center - of - mass ( com ) energy of @xmath391 .",
    "then , we have @xmath486 the invariants satisfy @xmath487 and @xmath488 . the @xmath489",
    "are half the energy of the corresponding particle , in the com frame .",
    "we also define the four light - like vectors pointing in the directions of the three particles as @xmath261 , @xmath490 and @xmath262 .",
    "so @xmath491 for each particle , we will also need the light - like vectors pointing in the opposite direction @xmath492 the scalar products between different @xmath55 can be obained from , and we also have @xmath493 we can also derive @xmath494 and its permutations .    in the com frame ,",
    "the transverse momentum of the @xmath495 or @xmath496 with respect to @xmath497 , @xmath497 or @xmath496 with respect to @xmath495 , and @xmath496 or @xmath495 with respect to @xmath496 are given , respectively , by @xmath498 we will also define @xmath0 as @xmath499 note that for @xmath98 , @xmath500 finally , it is helpful when discussing splitting functions , to use variables defined with respect to only two partons . if we are considering the quark and gluon , then we can use the invariant mass of the pair , and the energy fraction of the gluon @xmath501 some useful relations between these variables and the others are @xmath502      c.  w.  bauer and m.  d.  schwartz , arxiv : hep - ph/0604065 . c.  w.  bauer , s.  fleming and m.  e.  luke , phys .  rev .",

    "<S> we also show through scet that in the soft / collinear limit , successive branchings factorize , a fact which is essential to parton showers , and that the splitting functions of qcd are reproduced . finally , combining these results , we present a example of an algorithm that incorporates the scet results into an event generator which is systematically improvable . </S>"
