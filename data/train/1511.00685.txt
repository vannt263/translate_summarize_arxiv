    "magnetic fields play a crucial role in star formation . on the large ( cloud size )",
    "scale , they regulate collapse through both ambipolar diffusion  enabling collapse  and magnetic pressure support  hindering collapse @xcite .",
    "these magnetic fields are responsible for funneling material from large scale down to smaller ( disk size ) scales ( li et al . 2014 ) . at these smaller scales ,",
    "the magnetic field regulates disk accretion , wind launching , outflows and jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the magnetic field dictates whether proto - planetary disks can form and how they accrete .",
    "the small scale effects may have the most dramatic consequences for star formation and subsequently planet formation .",
    "in the ideal mhd limit , if the alignment of the field is parallel to the rotation axis of the infalling envelope , then magnetic braking occurs , hindering large disk growth at the earliest ( e.g. , class 0 object , * ? ? ? * ) protostellar stage ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , if the magnetic field is perpendicular , or misaligned , to the rotation axis of the envelope , then a large disk can grow in a class 0 object ( r @xmath0 100 au ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "simulations including non - ideal mhd effects show that small ( r @xmath0 10 au ) disks can indeed grow in class 0 objects , but do not reach larger radii until they are more evolved , class ii objects @xcite .",
    "this ambiguity in the importance of magnetic fields makes observations of the youngest sources vital to truly understanding the role magnetic fields play in star formation .",
    "recent high resolution observations of class 0 sources have provided important observational constraints for theory . the telescope array doing polarization ( tadpol )",
    "survey was a flux - limited , 1.3 mm polarization survey of 30 cores and 8 star forming regions to characterize their magnetic fields on 1000 au size scales @xcite .",
    "tadpol found that , on average , the inferred magnetic field is misaligned with the outflow direction ( used as a proxy for disk rotation axis ) , in contrast to the fact that they can appear aligned at the 10000 au scale @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that magnetic field morphology can change drastically from large to small scales and is potentially significant for understanding the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process .",
    "similarily , very high resolution observations have confirmed that for some of the keplerian class 0 disks that are known , the magnetic field orientations and disk planes are perpendicular to outflow directions consistent with misaligned fields , enabling disk formation ( vla 1623 , @xcite ; and l1527 , @xcite ) .",
    "we used the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) to conduct the vla nascent disk and multiplicity survey ( vandam)a high resolution survey of continuum emission at @xmath4 8.1 mm , 10.3 mm , 4.1 cm and 6.4 cm from all known protostars in the perseus region @xcite to determine structure , multiplicity and polarization properties of these young protostars .",
    "one of our sources , ngc1333 iras 4a ( hereafter iras 4a ) , has long been an ideal candidate for polarization observations at long wavelengths because of its high degree of polarization at millimeter wavelengths @xcite .    located in the perseus molecular cloud ( d @xmath0 230 pc , * ? ? ?",

    "multiple observations of iras 4a have shown a well - defined outflow arising from the binary system .",
    "@xcite resolves both outflows from the two sources .",
    "in addition to having multiple observations , iras 4a is incredibly bright in both the mm / sub - mm bands .    in this letter",
    ", we present unprecedented high - resolution polarization observations of iras 4a from the vla at 8.1 mm and 10.3 mm wavelengths .",
    "this is first ever polarization detection at these wavelengths in a protostar .",
    "we show the observed morphology of the inferred magnetic field and attempt to link it to the morphology seen at larger scales .",
    "we posit reasons why our data differ from earlier observations , and we use simple modeling to interpret observations .",
    "observations of iras 4a were taken as part of the vandam survey .",
    "iras 4a was observed in full stokes using the b - array of the vla in ka - band on 21 october 2013 with baselines ranging from 0.21 to 11.1 km .",
    "these observations of iras 4a included two other nearby science targets .",
    "all science scans were interleaved with scans of the complex gain calibrator j0336 + 3218 .",
    "we used 3c48 as our flux and polarization position angle calibrator , and 3c84 was used as our bandpass and leakage calibrator .",
    "we observed a second angle calibrator , 3c138 , to check measurement of the polarization angle .",
    "iras 4a was also observed in a - array in c - band ( @xmath2 = 4.1 and 6.4 cm ) on 16 march 2014 , using 3c48 as the bandpass and flux calibrator ( see for further details , * ? ? ?",
    "the correlator setup for ka - band had two basebands both with 4 ghz of bandwidth .",
    "each of these basebands was divided into 32 spectral windows , with each window consisting of 64 channels .",
    "the spectral windows had a bandwidth of 128 mhz .",
    "basebands were centered at @xmath2=8.1 mm and 10.3 mm .",
    "all four correlations were recorded to permit full stokes imaging .",
    "we first calibrated the data collected for iras 4a in ` casa ` for delay , bandpass and complex gain variations in the antennas .",
    "after the initial calibrations were done , we performed polarization calibrations that solved for leakage , cross - hand delay and r - l phase differences across the array .",
    "once these calibrations were done , the data were spectrally averaged into two data sets of 32 channels each , one for each of the two basebands .",
    "we then ` split ` out the science targets from the data set .",
    "the amplitude calibration for ka - band has @xmath010% uncertainty , and for c - band there is @xmath05% uncertainty . for the stokes calibration ,",
    "we only consider statistical uncertanties .",
    "once the calibration was done , we used ` clean ` to deconvolve the images .",
    "natural weighting was used to produce full stokes images of ka - band emission , maximizing sensitivity to polarization . as a cross - check we imaged the other two science targets and",

    "we found no polarization in the two science targets down to @xmath55.5% .",
    "our gain calibrator was found to be polarized at @xmath01% , as expected .",

    "to optimize the tradeoff between sensitivity and resolution , briggs weighting with a robust parameter equal to 0.25 was used to image the c - band emission .",
    "the c - band data had a synthesized beam of 0.42@xmath1 @xmath6 0.35@xmath1 with a position angle of 84.4@xmath7 for 6.4 cm and a beam size of 0.27@xmath1 @xmath6 0.23@xmath1 with a position angle of 85.5@xmath7 for 4.1 cm .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from our sed , we derived a value of @xmath8 @xmath0 2.2 which , when corrected for free - free contamination , corresponds to a dust spectral index @xmath9 @xmath0 3.2 and a @xmath3 value of 1.2 . because these fit values incorporate the relatively lower - resolution short wavelength data , they are upper limits , so @xmath9 @xmath5 3.2 and @xmath3 @xmath5 1.2 . since the free - free source is weak , we can infer that the centimeter emission is @xmath080% from dust emission",
    ". the polarization signal must be substantially due to dust emission as well .",
    "free - free emission is an unpolarized emission process ; other than dust emission from grains aligned in a magnetic field , the other potential process creating polarized emission could be synchrotron emission .",
    "however , the spectrum is inconsistent with synchrotron emission , which would be expected to have a negative spectral index at these frequencies .",
    "this flux level and @xmath3 value implies that large numbers of @xmath0 millimeter / centimeter - sized particles must have already grown and , also , survived in the 10 kyr age of iras 4a @xcite ; similarly low values of @xmath3 have been found for other class 0 sources , ( e.g. , l1448 irs 3 , l1157 * ? ? ?",

    "if our polarization signal does indeed trace a class 0 disk , this could have significant implications for models of grain - growth and evolution within proto - planetary disks and how quickly grains can form in such an environment .",
    "the combination of previous sma 850 @xmath10 m polarization observations @xcite and our vla 8.1 and 10.3 mm polarization observations provide insight into how the efficacy of grain alignment with magnetic field changes as a function of particle size .",
    "modeling by @xcite indicates that , at least for particles of size about a millimeter or smaller , the tendency of grains to align with the magnetic field decreases as a function of particle size .",
    "while this model has not been extrapolated to the @xmath11 millimeter - sized particles that we know are contributing to the dust emission that we observe , it is commonly accepted that the polarization fraction does not increase with particle size past 1 mm .",
    "the observational counterpart to this theoretical prediction is a decreasing polarization fraction with wavelength .",
    "however , the sma observations indicated a @xmath0few percent polarization towards the outskirts of the envelope and @xmath52 percent polarization towards the central protostar ( iras 4a1 ) .",
    "in contrast , we find a remarkably high average polarization of 15% at 8 mm and 18% at 10 mm , with a peak fractional polarization of @xmath020% .",
    "while we described above a few potential explanations for the relatively low fractional polarization of iras4a 1 at millimeter wavelengths , it is nonetheless striking that dust emission at this wavelength could be so highly polarized at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "figure 1 in @xcite , shows a fairly low ( @xmath52% ) polarization in the same spatial area where we observe @xmath010 - 20% . in lower resolution maps , we find that the beam averaging suppresses the polarization signal and at @xmath00.5@xmath1 we find a maximum polarization of @xmath04%",
    "this suggests that beam effects play a role in what the sma is seeing , although optical depth effects could also be at work  as the 850 @xmath10 m emission is likely to be much more optically thick than the 8.1 and 10.3 mm emission .",
    "this is the first time that polarization has been detected in a protostar at these wavelengths .",
    "our results suggest that large grains may grow at early times . on the small scale",
    ", we observe a very different magnetic field morphology than on the large scale , showing frozen - in field lines are likely dragged in by infalling material . with our results , we have demonstrated the versatility of the vla for detecting polarization on sub-100 au scales .",
