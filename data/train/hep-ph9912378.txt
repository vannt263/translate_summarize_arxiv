    "the presence of a flavor asymmetry in the light antiquark sea of the proton is now clearly established @xcite .",
    "it can be expressed either in terms of the difference , @xmath3 , or in terms of the ratio , @xmath4 .",
    "the fact that this difference is larger than zero ( or that the ratio is larger than one ) is usually referred to as @xmath5 flavor symmetry breaking in the proton sea .",
    "we will discuss in this paper the nonperturbative origin of the breaking of flavor symmetry , both at the @xmath5 and at the @xmath0 level . to this end , we will study the suppresion factor of @xmath6 antiquarks in the @xmath5 case , defined as    _ ( 2 ) = , [ kappa2 ] and the suppression factor of strangeness in the @xmath0 case : _ ( 3 ) = .",
    "[ kappa3 ] we notice that in the limit of exact @xmath5 ( @xmath0 ) flavor symmetry @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ccfr collaboration has measured @xcite @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) in a lo ( nlo ) qcd analysis .",
    "uncertainties apart , it is clear that there is a substantial violation of the @xmath0 flavor symmetry . in the nonstrange light antiquark sector , the use of the standard parametrizations leads to @xmath11 @xcite , indicating also a strong violation of the @xmath5 flavor symmetry in the proton sea . at the same time , the @xmath5 charge symmetry is believed to hold within the baryon octet , i.e. , @xmath12 in the proton is equal to @xmath13 in the neutron .",
    "an interesting question is how @xmath0 charge symmetry is broken within the baryon octet .",
    "if the symmetry were exact , it would mean , for instance , that @xmath14 in the proton should be equal to @xmath15 in the @xmath2 . however , as calculated by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , this is not the case , and in this work we also investigate the origins of the breaking of this symmetry .    in qcd , exact @xmath0 symmetry implies that the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks have the same mass . since the strange quark mass , @xmath19 , is significantly larger than the up and down quark masses , the symmetry is only approximate . at the hadronic level",
    ", exact @xmath0 symmetry also implies that the masses of baryons or mesons belonging to the same multiplets are all equal .",
    "clearly this is not the case and the masses within the baryon multiplets differ among themselves by more than @xmath20 .",
    "the mass discrepancy is even more pronounced in the meson octet .",
    "another consequence of the @xmath0 symmetry at the hadronic level is that the coupling constant in a generic baryon - baryon - meson ( @xmath21 ) vertex should be the same for all @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "since these three states together must form a @xmath0 singlet state , and the mesons are usually in octet states , it follows that the product of the two baryon representations must also be in a @xmath0 octet state . out of the ( @xmath25 ) product @xmath26 , we get two distinct octets and therefore two independent coupling constants .",
    "this is the origin of the two @xmath0 constants , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "when we consider some particular baryon - baryon - meson vertices , additional ( clebsch - gordan ) factors appear , so that the final couplings are different from each other .",
    "however , exact @xmath0 symmetry imposes a well defined connections between them .",
    "finally , analysis of experimental data determine the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 in terms of the parameter @xcite    _ d = 0.64 [ alfa ]    we can make use of qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) to calculate the above mentioned coupling constants @xcite . in this approach",
    "we are able to identify the @xmath0 breaking sources affecting the couplings , which are mainly the quark and hadron mass differences .",
    "the different values of the condensates and other qcdsr parameters also play an important role .    as for the origin",
    "os the asymmetry in the light antiquark distributions , there is now strong indications that part of the nucleon sea comes from fluctuations of the original nucleon into baryon - meson states , i.e. , from the meson cloud @xcite . the meson cloud model ( mcm )",
    "is dominated by hadronic quantities like hadron masses and coupling constants .",
    "this bridge between the physics of parton distribution and the conventional hadron physics may also help us , by connecting one with the other , to understand both @xmath0 symmetry breaking at the hadron and parton levels .",
    "in what follows , we show the meson - baryon fock decomposition of the proton and of the @xmath29 . in the case of the proton ,",
    "most of the material has been already presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we include it here just for completeness .",
    "parton distributions in the @xmath29 hyperon have been discussed in @xcite , and we will also address them in this work . this will enable us to make a close comparison between the proton and hyperon parton distributions .      as usual , we decompose the proton in the following possible fock states :    & & + |k^+ > +",
    "|^0 k^+ > + |^0 * k^+ > + |^+ k^0 > + |^+ * k^0 > ] [ fock ] where @xmath30 is the bare proton .",
    "we consider only light mesons .",
    "the relative normalization of these states is , in principle , fixed once the cloud parameters are given .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath31 measures the probability to find the proton in its bare state .",
    "in the @xmath32 state , the meson and the baryon have fractional momentum @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with distributions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "of course @xmath37 and these distributions are related by :    f_m / mb(z ) = f_b / mb(1-z ) [ fmb ]    the splitting function @xmath38 represents the probability density to find a meson with momentum fraction @xmath39 of the nucleon and is usually given by    @xmath40}{[t - m_{m}^2]^2}\\ , f_{m b p}^2 ( t)\\ ; , \\label{fpin}\\ ] ]    for baryons ( @xmath22 ) belonging to the octet , and    @xmath41 ^ 2 [ ( m_{p } - m_b)^2 - t ] } { 12 m_b^2 m_{p}^2 [ t - m_{m}^2]^2}\\ , f_{m b p}^2 ( t)\\ ;   \\label{fpidel}\\ ] ]    for baryons belonging to the decuplet . in the calculations we need the baryon - meson - baryon form factors appearing in the splitting functions . following a phenomenological approach , we use the dipole form :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the form factor cut - off parameter . in the above equations @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the four momentum square and the mass of the meson in the cloud state , @xmath46 is the maximum @xmath44 given by :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the mass of the baryon ( proton ) . since the function",
    "@xmath38 has the interpretation of a flux of mesons inside the proton , the corresponding integral    n_m / mb = _ mb _ 0 ^ 1 d y f_m / mb ( y ) , [ nmeson ] can be interpreted as the number of mesons in the proton , or the number of mesons in the air . in many works ,",
    "the magnitude of the multiplicities @xmath50 has been considered as a measure of the validity of mcm in the standard formulation with @xmath51 states . if these multiplicities turn out to be large ( @xmath52 ) then there is no justification for employing a one - meson truncation of the fock expansion , as the expansion ceases to converge .",
    "this may happen for large cut - off values .",
    "once the splitting functions ( [ fpin ] ) and ( [ fpidel ] ) are known we can calculate the antiquark distribution in the proton coming from the meson cloud through the convolution :    q_f ( x ) = _ mb _",
    "x^1 f_m / mb ( y ) q^m_f ( ) [ quark ] where @xmath53 is the valence antiquark distribution of flavor @xmath54 in the meson .",
    "an analogous expression holds for the quark distributions . with the above formula",
    "we can compute the @xmath55 and @xmath6 distributions , their difference , @xmath56 , and hence the gottfried integral :    s_g = - _ 0 ^ 1 [ d ( x ) - u(x ) ] dx [ gottfried ]    since we are interested in determining the sources of @xmath0 symmetry breaking , we also study the parton distributions in the case where the @xmath0 symmetry is exact . in our case",
    ", this is the limit in which we take all the meson and baryon masses to be the same in the @xmath0 multiplets .",
    "all other ingredients are , from the start , compatible with @xmath0 symmetry , i.e. , all coupling constants follow @xmath0 relations @xcite , and the cut - off parameters are the same for a given multiplet .",
    "of course , the nonstrange subset of these couplings respects the @xmath5 ( isospin ) symmetry .",
    "the masses are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the octet coupling constants are given by the expressions in table i @xcite , where @xmath63 @xcite and @xmath64 was given in eq .",
    "( [ alfa ] ) .",
    "for the decuplet coupling constants , in table ii , where @xmath65 @xcite , we also use the standard @xmath0 relations between the couplings @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table iv : * @xmath29 decuplet coupling constants .    for the cut - off parameters , we will use the same values as given by eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the separate contributions from the octet and decuplet states for @xmath66 ( 5a ) , @xmath67 ( 5b ) , @xmath68 ( 5c ) .",
    "the total distributions are shown in the fig .",
    "5d , and they should be compared with fig .",
    "we agree qualitatively with them .",
    "quantitative changes are noticeable , and they happen because of the inclusion of the decuplet states which play a significant role , as seen in figs . 5b and 5c .",
    "the fact that @xmath69 , was interpreted in @xcite as a violation of @xmath0 charge symmetry , and this really seems to be the case .",
    "even more indicative of this breaking is the direct comparison of @xmath70 in the proton ( dotted line ) with @xmath71 in the @xmath2 ( dot - dashed line ) , shown in fig .",
    "a huge discrepancy is seen between the two curves , a result in complete disagreement with naive expectations . as in the quark model",
    "the @xmath2 is a proton with the @xmath17 quark replaced by a @xmath18 quark , naively one would think that @xmath70 in the proton is equal to @xmath71 in the @xmath2 .    as we saw in section 2.1 , the pb effect is important in describing the @xmath72 dependence of the light quark sea asymmetry . from the point of view of fermi statistics ,",
    "the same effect should be present in the @xmath2 , with the @xmath18 quark here playing the role of the @xmath17 quark in the proton .",
    "because of the mass of the @xmath18 quark , the @xmath72 dependence of the pb in the @xmath2 may not be exactly the same as in the proton . however , to exemplify the size of the corrections from pb , we also plot in fig .",
    "6 the distributions including the effect of the pb given by eq . ( [ pauli ] ) .",
    "the solid line is for @xmath70 in the proton , and the dashed line is for @xmath71 in the @xmath2 .",
    "it seems also appropriate to extend the comparisons to @xmath15 in the @xmath2 , and to @xmath14 in the proton .",
    "we show the @xmath15 in fig . 7 , where the decuplet and octet contributions are shown separately .",
    "8 we show both differences and we see clearly the discrepancy between them , which is again an evidence of @xmath0 charge symmetry breaking .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that besides the small mass of the @xmath17 quark , the @xmath15 asymmetry in the @xmath2 is much larger than the @xmath14 asymmetry in the proton .    finally , in order to compare the @xmath0 flavor breaking in sea parton distributions in the @xmath29 with the proton , we compute @xmath73 defined in eq .",
    "( [ newkappa ] ) .",
    "the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ newkappa ] ) is governed by the large perturbative contributions and is only slightly affected by the cloud component .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that it is the same for the proton and for the @xmath29 . in the numerator",
    "we have approximated @xmath74^{np}$ ] by @xmath75^{np}$ ] in order to avoid uncertainties associated with @xmath76 in the hyperon .",
    "the resulting value for @xmath77 is then :    _ 3 0.85    this value of @xmath77 indicates a violation of @xmath0 flavor inside the @xmath2 which is weaker than that inside the proton , whereas figs .",
    "4 - 7 show a violation of the @xmath0 symmetry between the proton and the sigma .",
    "both symmetries are restored in the @xmath0 symmetry limit of eqs .",
    "( [ su3lim ] ) , i.e. , @xmath78 and the curves in the figures assume their expected behaviour , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    in the context of the meson cloud model",
    "this result is not surprising .",
    "the cloud expansion of the @xmath29 involves heavier states than those appearing in the proton expansion .",
    "as a consequence , the whole @xmath2 cloud will be suppressed with respect to the proton cloud .",
    "indeed , looking at the multiplicities we observe that the probabilities associated with the hyperon states are typically one order of magnitude smaller than those associated with the proton states .",
    "moreover , the strange states inside the proton are heavier and suppressed with respect to non - strange states , and therefore we expect ( and really observe ) @xmath81 . neglecting pauli blocking effects , ( which would slightly inhibit the @xmath82 production in comparison with the @xmath55 production in the @xmath2 )",
    "we would expect the same behaviour for the @xmath2 and this is exactly what we find .",
    "quantitatively , the suppression of @xmath83 in @xmath2 ( with respect to @xmath84 or @xmath85 ) , happens because all the states in the cloud contain strangeness and are nearly equally suppressed . in the proton the suppression of @xmath83 ( always with respect to @xmath84 or @xmath85 )",
    "is more pronounced because of the mass difference between strange and non - strange cloud states .",
    "in this work we have applied to meson cloud model to study the non - perturbative aspects of parton distributions , giving special emphasis to the strange sector .",
    "we have adjusted the cloud cut - off parameters to reproduce the e866 data on @xmath12 and @xmath86 . in this procedure",
    "the choices were not completely free . instead , the cut - off values had to be consistent with previous analises of other experimental information @xcite .",
    "having fixed the parameters we moved to the strange sector . in this sense , the results for the strange - anti - strange asymmetry and for @xmath87 can be considered as predictions .",
    "they are consistent with data .",
    "finally we have taken the @xmath0 limit in the meson cloud and found out that , in this limit , the parton distributions become @xmath0 flavor symmetric , i.e. , @xmath88 .",
    "we have thus presented additional experimental confirmation of the mcm .",
    "moreover we have concluded that the meson cloud is responsible for the @xmath0 flavor breaking in parton distributions .                                                              *",
