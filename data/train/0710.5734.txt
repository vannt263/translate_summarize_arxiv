    "much of cosmology is well - described by a space - time near a spatially isotropic friedmann ",
    "walker models with line elements @xmath0 where @xmath1 or @xmath2 , sourced by perfect fluids with equations of state @xmath3 .",
    "such an equation of state relates the matter pressure @xmath4 to its energy density @xmath5 and captures the thermodynamical properties in a form relevant for isotropic space - times in general relativity .",
    "often , one can assume the equation of state parameter @xmath6 to be constant during successive phases of the universe evolution , with sharp jumps between different phases such as @xmath7 during inflation , followed by @xmath8 during radiation domination and @xmath9 during matter domination .",
    "observationally relevant details can depend on the precise values of @xmath6 at a given stage , in particular if one uses an effective value describing a mixture of different matter components .",
    "for instance , during big bang nucleosynthesis one is in a radiation dominated phase mainly described by photons and relativistic fermions .",
    "photons , according to maxwell theory , have an exact equation of state parameter @xmath8 as a consequence of conformal invariance of the equations of motion ( such that the stress - energy tensor is trace - free ) . for fermions",
    "the general equation of state is more complicated and non - linear , but can in relativistic regimes be approximately given by the same value @xmath8 as for photons .",
    "in contrast to the case of maxwell theory , however , there is no strict symmetry such as conformal invariance which would prevent @xmath6 to take a different value .",
    "it is one of the main objectives of the present paper to discuss possible corrections to this value .    for big bang nucleosynthesis , it turns out , the balance between fermions and photons is quite sensitive .",
    "in fact , different values for the equation of state parameters might even be preferred phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "one possible reason for different equations of state could be different coupling constants of bosons and fermions to gravity , for which currently no underlying mechanism is known . in this paper",
    "we will explore the possibility whether quantum gravitational corrections to the equations of state can produce sufficiently different values for the equation of state parameters .",
    "in fact , since the fields are governed by different actions , one generally expects different , though small , correction terms which can be of significance in a delicate balance .",
    "note that we are not discussing ordinary quantum corrections of quantum fields on a classical background .",
    "those are expected to be similar for fermions and radiation in relativistic regimes .",
    "we rather deal with quantum gravity corrections in the coupling of the fields to the space - time metric , about which much less is known a priori .",
    "thus , different proposals of quantum gravity may differ at this stage , providing possible tests .",
    "an approach where quantum gravitational corrections can be computed is loop quantum cosmology @xcite , which specializes loop quantum gravity @xcite to cosmological regimes .",
    "in such a canonical quantization of gravity , equations of state must be computed from matter hamiltonians rather than covariant stress - energy tensors .",
    "quantum corrections to the underlying hamiltonian then imply corrections in the equation of state .",
    "this program was carried out for the maxwell hamiltonian in @xcite , and is done here for dirac fermions .",
    "there are several differences between the treatment of fermions and other fields , which from the gravitational point of view are mainly related to the fact that fermions , in a first order formulation , also couple to torsion and not just the curvature of space - time . after describing the classical derivation of equations of state as well as steps of a loop quantization and its correction terms",
    ", we use big bang nucleosynthesis constraints to see how sensitively we can bound quantum gravity parameters .    we have aimed to make the paper nearly self - contained and included some of the technical details .",
    "[ sec : canonical formulation ] on the canonical formulation of fermions , [ sec : modifications ] on quantum corrections from loop quantum gravity and [ sec : bbn ] on the analysis of big bang nucleosynthesis can , however , be read largely independently of each other by readers only interested in some of the aspects covered here .",
    "we will start with general remarks on the physics underlying the problem .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis happens at energy scales @xmath10 which are large , but still tiny compared to the planck energy @xmath11 .",
    "also the universe has already grown large compared to the planck length @xmath12 at this stage , and space - time curvature is small .",
    "one may thus question why quantum gravity should play any role .",
    "there is certainly a fine balance required for successful big bang nucleosynthesis , but the expected quantum gravity terms of the order @xmath13 , obtained based on dimensional arguments , would have no effect .    however , dimensional arguments do not always work , in particular if more than two parameters @xmath14 of the same dimension , or any large dimensionless numbers are involved . then , precise calculations have to be done to determine which geometric means @xmath15 with @xmath16 may appear as coefficients , or which powers of dimensionless numbers occur as factors of correction terms . in loop quantum gravity ,",
    "we are in such a situation : there is the macroscopic length scale @xmath17 , which in our case we can take as the typical wave length of fields during nucleosynthesis , and also the planck length @xmath18 which arises due to the presence of newton s constant @xmath19 and planck s constant @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , there is a third and in general independent scale @xmath21 given by the microscopic size of elementary spatial patches in a quantum gravity state .",
    "this is a new feature of the fundamentally discrete theory , for which the precise state of quantum gravity plays an important role .",
    "although @xmath21 must be proportional to the planck length , its specific value for a given state can differ numerically .",
    "then , a detailed calculation must show how @xmath17 , @xmath21 and @xmath12 appear in quantum gravity corrections and which numerical values may arise .",
    "alternatively , one can work with only two length scales , @xmath17 and @xmath12 , but one has to deal with a large dimensionless parameter @xmath22 given by the number of discrete patches of the underlying state in the volume considered , for instance a volume of the size @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "examples of cosmological phenomena are known where this does play a role for quantum gravity corrections @xcite , and here we analyze which features arise in the presence of fermions and especially for big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "there are precedents where such considerations have played important roles .",
    "best known is the evidence for the atomic nature of matter derived by einstein from the phenomenon of brownian motion . also here",
    ", there are several orders of magnitude between the expected size of molecules and the resolution of microscopes at that time . however , there is also a large number of molecules which by their sheer number can and do leave sizeable effects on much larger suspended particles .",
    "there is , of course , never a guarantee that something analogous has to happen elsewhere .",
    "but this is to be checked by calculations and can not always be ruled out based only on dimensional arguments .",
    "we can use the result of corrections to the equation of state of radiation derived in @xcite , but a new analysis is required for fermions and their specific action . even in relativistic regimes , the coupling of fermions to gravity differs from other fields , e.g.by torsion contributions which arise already from the kinetic term of the dirac action .",
    "one could thus expect that quantum corrections for fermions differ from those to radiation and thus , by throwing off the balance during nucleosynthesis , possibly enhance the effect of quantum gravity corrections .",
    "whether or not this happens can not be decided without detailed calculations as they are reported and applied here .",
    "for fermions , one has to use a tetrad @xmath25 rather than a space - time metric @xmath26 , which are related by @xmath27 , in order to formulate an action with the appropriate covariant derivative of fermions .",
    "this naturally leads one to a first - order formalism of gravity in which the basic configuration variables are a connection 1-form and the tetrad . in vacuum",
    "the connection would , as a consequence of field equations , be the torsion - free spin connection compatible with the tetrad . in the presence of matter fields which couple directly to the connection , such as fermions , this is no longer the case and",
    "there is torsion @xcite .",
    "a canonical analysis of gravity minimally coupled to fermions is presented in detail in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a non - minimally coupled action is proposed in order to eliminate violations of parity . here , we first present a general canonical analysis providing a consistent canonical formulation for all coupling parameters . at the end of this section ,",
    "we briefly comment on parity which plays a role in this context .",
    "the basic configuration variables in a lagrangian formulation of fermionic field theory are the dirac bi - spinor @xmath28 and its adjoint @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the minkowski dirac matrices .",

    "immirzi parameter @xmath40 can arise ) .",
    "as usually , a hamiltonian formalism of gravity requires a space - time foliation @xmath52 such that one can introduce fields and their rates of change , which will provide canonical variables .",
    "this is done by referring to a time function @xmath53 as well as a time evolution vector field @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "rates of change of spatial fields will then be associated with their derivatives along @xmath56 .    for convenience ,",
    "one decomposes @xmath54 into normal and tangential parts with respect to @xmath57 by defining the lapse function @xmath58 and the shift vector @xmath59 such that @xmath60 with @xmath61 . here",
    ", @xmath62 is the unit normal vector field to the hypersurfaces @xmath57 . the space - time metric @xmath26 induces a spatial metric @xmath63 on @xmath64 by the formula @xmath65 .",
    "this is one of the basic fields of a canonical formulation , and its momentum will be related to @xmath66 defined as the lie derivative of @xmath67 along @xmath56 .",
    "since contractions of @xmath68 and @xmath69 with the normal @xmath62 vanish , they give rise to spatial tensors @xmath67 and @xmath70 .    in our case",
    ", we are using a tetrad formulation , where @xmath25 provides a map from the tangent space of space - time to an internal minkowski space .",
    "the space - time foliation thus requires an associated space - time splitting of the minkowski space .",
    "this takes the form of a partial gauge fixing on the internal vector fields of the tetrad : the directions ( or rather boosts ) of tetrad fields can no longer be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "instead , we decompose the tetrad into a fixed internal unit time - like vector field and a triad on the space @xmath64 . we choose the internal vector field to be constant , @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "then , we allow only those tetrads which are compatible with the fixed @xmath73 in the sense that @xmath74 is the unit normal to the given foliation .",
    "this implies that @xmath75 with @xmath76 so that @xmath77 is a spatial triad .",

    " barbero connection @xcite @xmath90 with the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this connection is important because it provides a convenient canonical structure with poisson brackets @xmath91 with the densitized triad @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , following the steps presented in @xcite , it is straightforward to show that the torsion contribution to the spin connection @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 one can then show that @xmath95 , with @xmath96 being the torsion - free spin connection compatible with the co - triad @xmath97 .    for a fixed value of @xmath40 , the above equation for torsion reduces to that for minimal coupling as @xmath98 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , based on a lagrangian analysis , another interesting case is @xmath99 , which reduces @xmath100 to @xmath101 , making torsion @xmath40-independent .",
    "the non - minimal coupling is important for the behavior of the action under parity reversal , and it is the value @xmath99 which provides parity invariance of the combined system of gravity and fermions .",
    "this may seem surprising because neither vacuum gravity nor the minimal dirac action on a fixed background violate parity , and thus the extra term of non - minimal coupling seems to introduce parity violation .",
    "as @xcite in the lagrangian picture and @xcite in the hamiltonian picture show , however , the torsion introduced by coupling fermions to gravity also introduces parity violation in the holst action , which has to be canceled by the additional term of non - minimal coupling .",
    "( the action with minimal coupling was called `` not fully consistent '' in @xcite , while our analysis is consistent for any value of @xmath35 . to avoid potential confusion",

    "parity properties are different in both cases , and the observation of @xcite refers only to this behavior",
    ". the holst action with minimal coupling would indeed be inconsistent with parity preservation , but it does not present an inconsistency of the overall framework unless one explicitly requires parity preservation .",
    "in fact , parity violation is expected at the onset of bbn due to weak interactions .",
    "anyway , the following discussion of our paper can remain unchanged for different values of @xmath35 and thus applies directly to the parity preserving case . )    upon inserting ( [ cbk5 ] ) in ( [ totalpsiexpansion ] ) and ( [ nonminimalactionexpansion ] ) , the action ( [ action2 ] ) takes the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 and we have used the covariant derivatives , @xmath105 , related to the ashtekar - barbero connection , and @xmath106 .",
    "the first part of the action in this form shows that momenta of the fermion field are @xmath107 of @xmath108{q}\\psi$ ] and @xmath109 of @xmath110{q}\\eta$ ] . here",
    ", we are using half - densitized spinor fields to avoid complex - valued canonical variables @xcite .",
    "moreover , the action provides the hamiltonian @xmath111 .",
    "together with fermion dependent terms resulting from the gravitational action , this provides derivative terms and self - interaction terms in the hamiltonian @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "the top line of this expression is the most important one because its derivative terms are dominant in relativistic regimes .",
    "in addition to those , we highlight the presence of four - fermion interactions in the second line , which we summarize as @xmath114 as it multiplies @xmath115 .      from the hamiltonian",
    "we can determine energy and pressure and formulate the equation of state .",

    "@xmath121 this results in an equation of state @xmath122    in relativistic regimes , the kinetic term involving partial derivatives @xmath123 contained in @xmath124 is dominant , which leaves us with an equation of state @xmath125 whose leading term agrees with the parameter for a maxwell field .",
    "but there are clearly correction terms for fermions already in the classical first order theory .",
    "they do not arise for the maxwell field , implying a difference in the coupling to gravity due to torsion , which is present even in relativistic regimes .",
    "the order of magnitude of the additional term depends on the fermion current density and is thus not expected to be large unless regimes are very dense .",
    "we will not consider this correction further in this article , but highlight its role as a consequence of torsion .",
    "in addition , the canonical analysis performed here provides the stage for a quantization of the theory , resulting in further correction terms from quantum gravity as they occur even for the maxwell field @xcite .",
    "their magnitudes must also be extracted and then compared for the different fields .",
    "we are now in a position to derive the form of quantum gravity corrections for fermion fields in an explicit scenario of quantum gravity , completing the program of sec .",
    "[ sec : physics ]",
    ". we will not require the quantized dynamics of gravity , which makes our aim feasible .",
    "but we do need to know how the triad is quantized because it appears in the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "it appears as a basic variable in the poisson relations ( [ poisson ] ) , together with the ashtekar ",
    "barbero connection @xmath126 .",
    "loop quantum gravity @xcite proceeds by forming a quantum representation of these basic fields which turns holonomies @xmath127 along arbitrary spatial curves @xmath43 into creation operators of geometrical excitations along these curves .",
    "many such creations then excite a discrete state based on the graph formed by all curves used . on such a state , @xmath128 is quantized through the fluxes @xmath129 through surfaces @xmath130 with co - normal @xmath131 .",
    "resulting operators have eigenvalues obtained by counting intersections of the surface and the graph in the state , weighed by multiplicities of overlapping curves .",
    "this structure is important for a background independent representation which replaces the usual fock representation of quantum fields on a curved background space - time .",
    "the fock representation requires a metric to define basic concepts such as a vacuum state or creation and annihilation operators , which can thus not be used for the non - perturbative gravitational field itself .",
    "this mathematical property has important physical implications because extended objects , namely the integrated holonomies and fluxes , are used as basic quantities . in this way , there is non - locality and other implications which affect quantum gravity corrections .    in loop quantum gravity , there are three main effects which imply correction terms in effective matter equations .",
    "any hamiltonian contains inverse powers of triad components such as @xmath132 in ( [ dirachamiltonianconstraint3 ] ) , which for fermions is a consequence of the fact that they are quantized through half - densities @xcite . the loop quantization , however , leads to triad operators which have discrete spectra containing zero , thus lacking inverse operators .",
    "a proper quantization , along the lines of @xcite , does give a well - defined operator with the correct semiclassical limit .",
    "but there are deviations from the classical behavior on small length scales , which are the first source of correction terms . as in the case of the maxwell field",
    "@xcite , this is the main effect we include here .    in addition , there are qualitatively different correction terms . first , loop quantum gravity is spatially discrete , with states supported on spatial graphs .",
    "quantizations of hamiltonians thus lead to a discrete representation of any spatial derivative term as they also occur for fermions .",
    "the classical expression arises in a continuum limit , but for any given state the discrete representation implies corrections to the classical derivatives as the leading terms in an expansion .",
    "secondly , the connection is quantized through holonomies rather than its single components .",
    "thus , the quantum hamiltonians are formulated in terms of exponentials of line integrals of the connection which also give the leading classical term plus corrections in an expansion .",
    "finally , whenever a hamiltonian is not quadratic , there are genuine quantum effects as they occur in typical low energy effective actions .",
    "they can be computed in a hamiltonian formulation as well @xcite , contributing yet another source of corrections .",
    "one certainly needs to know the relative magnitude of all corrections in order to see which ones have to be taken into account .",
    "for all of them , the magnitude depends on details of the quantum state describing the regime . here",
    ", properties of states have to be taken into account , and dimensional arguments are no longer sufficient .",
    "for instance , discretization and curvature corrections depend on the patch size occurring in the discrete state underlying quantum gravity .",
    "this patch size is typically small compared to scales on which the matter field changes , even in relativistic regimes assumed here .",
    "thus , such corrections can be ignored in a first approximation .",
    "what remains are corrections from inverse powers .",
    "while other corrections shrink in the continuum limit where the patch size becomes small , inverse corrections actually grow when the patch size approaches the planck length .",
    "the regimes where the two classes of corrections are dominant are thus neatly separated , and we can safely focus on inverse triad corrections only . the relevant formulas are collected in appendix [ appen : lqg ] ; see also @xcite .",
    "a detailed and complete derivation is not yet available since precise properties of a quantum gravity state would be required .",
    "still , many general qualitative insights can be gained in this way .    in the dirac hamiltonian ( [ dirachamiltonianconstraint3 ] )",
    "the factor to be quantized containing inverse powers of the densitized triad is @xmath133 in terms of the volume @xmath134 of one discrete patch at a point @xmath135 .",
    "we can already notice the close resemblance to the maxwell hamiltonian , where the corresponding expression is @xmath136 which differs only by the additional @xmath137-tensors .",
    "this close relation will , in the end , lead to quite similar quantum corrections for photons and fermions .",
    "we proceed using ( [ av ] ) for @xmath138 , and write @xmath139 which can then be quantized by turning poisson brackets into commutators of operators .",
    "this results in @xmath140 with @xmath141 defined in ( [ bc ] ) . as explicit calculations in the appendix show , eigenvalues ( [ cv ] ) of the operator @xmath142 , or its expectation values in semiclassical states , do not follow precisely the behavior expected for the classical function it quantizes .",
    "deviations become larger for small values of the triad components , which can be captured in a correction function @xmath143 $ ] multiplying the classical expression . in particular",
    ", such a correction function will appear in a hamiltonian operator , thus also correcting expressions for energy density and pressure or the equation of state .",
    "the functional form follows from eqs .",
    "( [ cv ] ) and ( [ alphav ] ) .",
    "thus the general expression one can expect for a phenomenological dirac hamiltonian including corrections from inverse powers of the triad is @xmath144 with two possibly different correction functions @xmath35 and @xmath145 .",
    "this also affects the energy density and pressure terms , derived by the general expressions ( [ rhogeneral ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) .",
    "we are mainly interested in the correction to the one - third in the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) , so we focus on the first term in ( [ dirachamiltonianconstraint5 ] ) in what follows .",
    "moreover , for a _ nearly _ isotropic background geometry",
    "@xmath35 only depends on the determinant @xmath81 of the spatial metric and thus @xmath146 with the scale factor @xmath147 related to @xmath81 by @xmath148 . in this case",

    "( [ cv ] ) and ( [ alphav ] ) , simplifies . to use these expressions",

    "energy density and the pressure then are , ignoring the classical interaction term @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 from this , the equation of state @xmath6 can easily be computed : @xmath179 this quantum gravity correction is independent of the specific matter dynamics as in the classical relativistic case .",
    "it results in an equation of state which is linear in @xmath5 , but depends on the geometrical scales ( and the planck length ) through @xmath35 .",

    ", we retrieve the classical result @xmath185 , but for @xmath186 loop quantum gravity corrections induced by the discreteness of flux operators are reflected in the evolution of energy density in a friedmann  robertson  walker universe .",
    "the production of elements in the early universe is highly sensitive to the expansion rate , given by @xmath187 where @xmath5 is the total density , thus including radiation and fermions . as we have seen here for fermions and in @xcite for radiation ,",
    "the effect of loop quantum gravity corrections is to multiply the effective @xmath188 by a factor @xmath166 .",
    "most importantly , we find that @xmath166 is the _ same _ for both bosons and fermions ( up to possible quantization ambiguities ) , so a separate treatment of the two types of particles in the early universe ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is unnecessary here .    in the standard treatment of the thermal history of the universe ,",
    "the density of relativistic particles ( bosons or fermions ) is given by @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the number of spin degrees of freedom for bosons , and @xmath191 times the number of spin degrees of freedom for fermions , and @xmath192 is the temperature , which scales as @xmath193 the equation of state parameter is @xmath194 clearly , equations ( [ rhostandard])([pstandard ] ) are inconsistent with equations ( [ modifiedw ] ) and ( [ correctedrho ] ) .",
    "there is some ambiguity in determining the correct way to modify the expressions for @xmath195 and @xmath6 .",
    "we have chosen to assume that the modifications are contained in the gravitational sector , so that the density is given by @xmath196 with the temperature scaling as in equation ( [ tstandard ] ) , and the equation of state @xmath6 is given by equation ( [ modifiedw ] ) .",
    "this guarantees that the standard continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) continues to hold .",
    "note that this is not the only way to incorporate equation ( [ correctedrho ] ) into the calculation , but it seems to us the most reasonable way .",
    "this issue requires a consideration of thermodynamics on a quantum space - time , which is a fascinating but not well - studied area . instead of entering details here",
    ", we note that we interpret the @xmath35-correction as a consequence of a quantum gravity sink to energy and entropy .",
    "thus , quantum gravity implies a non - equilibrium situation which would otherwise imply that @xmath5 must be proportional to @xmath197 without any additional dependence on @xmath198 .    with these assumptions , we can simply treat @xmath166 as an effective multiplicative change in the overall value of @xmath19 . note that this simplification is only possible because we explicitly derived by our canonical analysis that , unexpectedly , quantum corrections of radiation and fermions appear in similar forms",
    "this makes possible a comprehensive derivation of implications for bbn , bearing on earlier work .",
    "in fact , a great deal of work has been done on the use of bbn to constrain changes in @xmath19 ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "the calculation is straightforward , if one has a functional form for the time - variation in @xmath19 . for the loop quantum gravity corrections considered here ,",
    "the most reasonable functional form is ( [ alpha(a ) ] ) .",
    "note that this expression is by construction valid only in the limit where @xmath199 . in terms of the effective gravitational constant , @xmath19",
    ", one can then write @xmath200,\\ ] ] where @xmath201 is the present - day value of the gravitational constant .    in order to constrain the values of @xmath175 and @xmath174",
    ", we calculate the predicted element abundances with the indicated change in @xmath19 and compare with observational constraints . big bang nucleosynthesis proceeds first through the weak interactions that interconvert protons and neutrons : @xmath202 when @xmath203 mev , the weak - interaction rates are faster than the expansion rate , @xmath204 , and the neutron - to - proton ratio ( @xmath205 ) tracks its equilibrium value @xmath206 $ ] , where @xmath207 is the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "as the universe expands and cools , the expansion rate becomes too fast for weak interactions to maintain weak equilibrium and @xmath205 freezes out .",
    "nearly all the neutrons which survive this freeze - out are converted into @xmath208he as soon as deuterium becomes stable against photodisintegration , but trace amounts of other elements are produced , particularly deuterium and @xmath209li ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .    in the standard model ,",
    "the predicted abundances of all of these light elements are a function of the baryon - photon ratio , @xmath33 , but any change in @xmath19 alters these predictions .",
    "prior to the era of precision cmb observations ( i.e. , before wmap ) , big bang nucleosynthesis provided the most stringent constraints on @xmath33 , and modifications to the standard model could be ruled out only if no value of @xmath33 gave predictions for the light element abundances consistent with the observations .",
    "however , the cmb observations now provide an independent estimate for @xmath33 , which can be used as an input parameter for big - bang nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "copi et al .",
    "@xcite have recently argued that the most reliable constraints on changes in @xmath19 can be derived by using the wmap values for @xmath33 in conjuction with deuterium observations .",
    "the reason is that deuterium can be observed in ( presumably unprocessed ) high - redshift quasi stellar object ( qso ) absorption line systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , while the estimated primordial @xmath208he abundance , derived from observations of low metallicity hii regions , is more uncertain ( see , for example , the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . while we agree with the argument of copi et al . in principle , for the particular model under consideration here it makes more sense to use limits on @xmath208he than on deuterium , in conjunction with the wmap value for @xmath33 .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath208he abundance is most sensitive to changes in the expansion rate at @xmath210 mev , when the freeze - out of the weak interactions determines the fraction of neutrons that will eventually be incorporated into @xmath208he .",
    "deuterium , in contrast , is produced in big bang nucleosynthesis only because the expansion of the universe prevents all of the deuterium from being fused into heavier elements .",
    "thus , the deuterium abundance is most sensitive to the expansion rate at the epoch when this fusion process operates ( @xmath211 mev ) .",
    "the importance of this distinction with regard to modifications of the standard model was first noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a very nice quantitative analysis was given recently in ref .",
    "note that our estimate for the behavior of @xmath212 , equation ( [ g(a ) ] ) , is a steeply decreasing function of @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the change in the primordial @xmath208he abundance will always be much larger than the change in the deuterium abundance .",
    "therefore , we can obtain better constraints on this model by using extremely conservative limits on @xmath208he , rather than by using the more reliable limits on the deuterium abundance .",
    "for the same reason , we can ignore any effect on the cmb , since the latter is generated at a much larger value of @xmath147 , and any change will be minuscule .",
    "hence , we can confidently use the wmap value for @xmath33 .",
    "wmap gives @xcite @xmath213 because the estimated errors on @xmath33 are so small , we simply use the central value for @xmath33 ; the bounds we derive on @xmath175 in equation ( [ alpha(a ) ] ) change only slightly when @xmath33 is varied within the range given by equation ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "since @xmath175 in equations ( [ alpha(a ) ] ) and ( [ g(a ) ] ) is thought to be positive , the effect of lqg corrections is to increase the primordial expansion rate , which increases the predicted @xmath208he abundance .",
    "we therefore require an observational upper bound on the primordial @xmath208he abundance .",
    "as noted earlier , this is a matter of some controversy .",
    "we therefore adopt the very conservative upper bound recommended by olive and skillman @xcite : @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the primordial mass fraction of @xmath208he . for a fixed value of @xmath174 in equation ( [ g(a ) ] ) , we determine the largest value of @xmath175 that yields a primordial @xmath208he abundance consistent with this upper limit on @xmath215 . since we are essentially bounding the change in @xmath19 at @xmath216 , it is convenient to rewrite equation ( [ alpha(a ) ] ) as @xmath217 where @xmath218 .",
    "this upper bound on @xmath219 as a function of @xmath174 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] . for the special case @xmath220",
    ", we can use these results to place a bound on @xmath161 in equation ( [ alphasim ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath221 this is not a strong bound for the parameters of quantum gravity , but clearly demonstrates that quantum corrections are consistent with successful big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "= 3.3truein    in terms of more tangible quantum gravity parameters , we have @xmath222 for the number of patches at the time of big bang nucleosynthesis . in terms of the volume @xmath223 at this time , we have @xmath224 with the value @xmath225 of the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter as derived from black hole entropy calculations .",
    "more meaningfully , if we view @xmath226 as the basic length scale as it appears in the spectrum ( [ fluxvert ] ) of loop quantum gravity , the bound becomes more interesting : this gives @xmath227 .",
    "this upper limit is already quite close to what one expects for elementary patch sizes in loop quantum gravity , which would provide @xmath228 as a fundamental upper limit . given that these values are close to each other , we see a clear potential of improvements by more precise observational inputs .",
    "moreover , other correction terms from quantum gravity could be used to obtain a lower bound for @xmath164 such that the allowed window would be reduced to a smaller size .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis is a highly relativistic regime which , to a good approximation , implies identical equations of state for fermions and photons .",
    "there are , however , corrections to the simple equation of state @xmath8 for fermions even classically .",
    "one observation made here is that the interaction term derived in @xcite leads to such a correction and might be more constrained by nucleosynthesis than through standard particle experiments @xcite .",
    "we have not analyzed this further here because more details of the behavior of the fermion current would be required .",
    "a second source of corrections arises from quantum gravity .",
    "remarkably , while quantum gravity effects on an isotropic background do correct the equations of state , they do so equally for photons and relativistic fermions . initially , this is not expected for both types of fields due to their very different actions .",
    "thus , quantum gravity effects do not spoil the detailed balance required for the scenario to work and bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis obtained so far are not strong .",
    "but there are interesting limits for the primary parameter , the patch size of a quantum gravity state .",
    "it is dimensionally expected to be proportional to the planck length @xmath12 but could be larger .",
    "in fact , current bounds derived here already rule out a patch size of exactly the elementary allowed value in loop quantum gravity . with more precise estimates ,",
    "these bounds can be improved further .",
    "we have made use of quantum gravity corrections in a form which does not distinguish fermions from radiation .",
    "although the most natural implementation , quite unexpectedly , provides equal corrections as shown here , there are several possibilities for differences which suggest several further investigations .",
    "small deviations in the equations of state and thus energy densities of fermions and radiation are possible .",
    "first , there are always quantization ambiguities , and so far we tacitly assumed that the same basic quantization choice is made for the maxwell and dirac hamiltonians .",
    "such ambiguity parameters can be explicitly included in specific formulas for correction functions ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "independent consistency conditions for the quantization may at some point require one to use different quantizations for both types of fields , resulting in different quantum corrections and different energy densities .",
    "such conditions can be derived from an analysis of anomaly - freedom of the maxwell field and fermions coupled to gravity , which is currently in progress . as shown here , if this is the case it will become testable in scenarios sensitive to the behavior of energy density such as big bang nucleosynthesis . moreover , assuming the same quantization parameters leads to identical quantum corrections for photons and fermions only on isotropic backgrounds .",
    "small - scale anisotropies have different effects on both types of fields and can thus also be probed through their implications on the equation of state .    for this",
    ", it will be important to estimate more precisely the typical size of corrections , which is not easy since it requires details of the quantum state of geometry .",
    "the crucial ingredient is again the patch size of underlying lattice states . on the other hand ,",
    "taking a phenomenological point of view allows one to estimate ranges for patch sizes which would leave one in agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "interestingly , corrections studied here provide upper bounds to the patch size , and other corrections from quantum gravity are expected to result in lower bounds . a finite window",
