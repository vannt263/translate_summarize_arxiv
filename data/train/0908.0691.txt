    "a representation in the form of a linear superposition of elements of a vector space is said to be _ sparse _ if the number of elements in the superposition is small , in comparison to the dimension of the corresponding space .",
    "the interest for sparse representations has enormously increased the last few years , in large part due to their convenience for signal processing techniques and the results produced by the theory of compressed sensing with regard to the reconstruction of sparse signals from non - adaptive measurements @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the classical problem of expressing a signal as a linear superposition of elements taken from an orthogonal basis has been extended to consider the problem of expressing a signal as a linear superposition of elements , called _ atoms _ , taken from a redundant set , called _ dictionary _ @xcite . the corresponding signal approximation in terms of highly correlated atoms is said to be _ highly nonlinear _ and has been proved relevant to signal processing applications . moreover , a formal mathematical setting for highly nonlinear approximations is being developed . as a small sample of relevant literature",
    "let us mention @xcite .    in regard to sparse approximations there are two main problems to be looked at ; one is in relation to the design of suitable algorithms for finding the sparse approximation , and other the construction of the dictionaries endowing the approximation with the property of sparsity . in this communication",
    "we consider the sparse representation matter for the large class of signals which are amenable to satisfactory approximation in spline spaces @xcite . given a signal",
    ", we have the double goal of a ) finding a spline space for approximating the signal and b ) constructing those dictionaries for the space which are capable of providing a sparse representation of such a signal . in order to achieve both aims",
    "we first discuss the construction of dictionaries of b - spline functions for non - uniform partitions , because the usual choice , the b - spline basis for the space , is not expected to yield sparse representations .    in a previous publication @xcite a prescription for constructing b - spline dictionaries on the compact interval",
    "is advised by restricting considerations to uniform partitions ( cardinal spline spaces ) .",
    "since our aim entails to relax this restriction , we are forced to look at the problem from a different perspective . here",
    "we divide the partition into subpartitions and construct the dictionary by joining together the bases for the subspaces associated to each subpartition .",
    "the resulting dictionary is proved to span the spline space for the given non - uniform partition .",
    "consequently , the uniform case considered in @xcite arises as a particular case of this general construction .",
    "the capability of the proposed nonuniform dictionaries to produce sparse representations is illustrated by a number of examples .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : section 2 introduces splines spaces and gives the necessary definitions .",
    "the property of splines spaces which provides us with the foundations for the construction of the proposed dictionaries is proven in this section ( c.f .",
    "theorem 2 ) . for a fixed partition , the actual constructions of non - uniform b - spline dictionaries",
    "is discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 addresses the problem of finding the appropriate partition giving rise to the spline space suitable for approximating a given signal . in the same section a number of examples are presented , which illustrate an important feature of dictionaries for the adapted spaces .",
    "namely , they may render a very significant gain in the sparseness of the representation of those signals which are well approximated in the corresponding space .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "we refer to the fundamental books @xcite for a complete treatment of splines . here",
    "we simply introduce the adopted notation and the basic definitions which are needed for presenting our results .    given a finite closed interval @xmath0 $ ] we define a _ partition _ of @xmath0 $ ] as the finite set of points @xmath1 we further define @xmath2 subintervals @xmath3 as : @xmath4 and @xmath5 $ ] .    [ splinespace ] let @xmath6 be the space of polynomials of degree smaller or equal to @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a positive integer and define @xmath9\\ : \\",
    "f|_{i_i}\\in\\pi_{m-1 } , i=0,\\dots , n\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 indicates the restriction of the function @xmath11 on the interval @xmath12 .",
    "the standard result established by the next theorem is essential for our purpose .",
    "( @xcite , pp.111 ) [ th : bas ] let @xmath13 then @xmath14 where @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 otherwise .",
    "we are now ready to prove the theorem from which our proposal will naturally arise .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two partitions of @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "it holds to be true that @xmath20    it stems from theorem 1 and the basic result of linear algebra establishing that for @xmath21 and @xmath22 two sets such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one has @xmath25 .    certainly , from theorem 1 and for @xmath26 we have : @xmath27 , @xmath28",
    ". hence @xmath29 so that , using theorem 1 on the right hand side , the proof is concluded .",
    "the next corollary is a direct consequence of the above theorem .",
    "[ cr:1 ] suppose that @xmath30 are partitions of @xmath0 $ ]",
    ". then @xmath31",
    "let us start by recalling that an _ extended partition _ with single inner knots associated with @xmath32 is a set @xmath33 such that @xmath34 and the first and last @xmath8 points @xmath35 can be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "with each fixed extended partition @xmath36 there is associated a unique b - spline basis for @xmath32 , that we denote as @xmath37 .",
    "the b - spline @xmath38 can be defined by the recursive formulae @xcite : @xmath39 the following theorem paves the way for the construction of dictionaries for @xmath40 .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath41 to indicate the cardinality of a set .",
    "[ th : dic ] let @xmath42 be partitions of @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath43 .",
    "we denote the b - spline basis for @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "accordingly , a dictionary , @xmath46 , for @xmath40 can be constructed as @xmath47 so as to satisfy @xmath48 when @xmath49 , @xmath50 is reduced to the b - spline basis of @xmath40 .",
    "it immediately follows from corollary [ cr:1 ] . indeed",
    ", @xmath51    note that the number of functions in the above defined dictionary is equal to @xmath52 , which is larger than @xmath53 .",
    "hence , excluding the trivial case @xmath49 , the dictionary constitutes a redundant dictionary for @xmath40 .    according to theorem [ th : dic ] , to build a dictionary for @xmath40 we need to choose @xmath54-subpartitions @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",
    "this gives a great deal of freedom for the actual construction of a non - uniform b - spline dictionary .",
    "1 shows some examples which are produced by generating a random partition of @xmath57 $ ] with 6 interior knots . from an arbitrary partition @xmath58",
    "we generate two subpartitions as @xmath59 and join together the b - spline basis for @xmath60 ( light lines in the right graphs of fig .  1 ) and @xmath61 ( dark lines in the same graphs )     +",
    "as should be expected , the cardinal b - spline dictionaries introduced in @xcite arise here as particular cases of the proposed construction . in order to show this we use @xmath62 to denote an equidistant partition of @xmath0 $ ] with distance @xmath63 between adjacent points such that @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath62 is composed by the inner knots @xmath65 .",
    "we also consider the partition @xmath66 with knots @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a fixed integer in @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath71 , we can build a dictionary as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the cardinal b - spline basis for the subspace determined by the partition @xmath66 .",
    "this yields a cardinal b - spline dictionary as proposed in @xcite .",
    "given a signal , @xmath11 say , we address now the issue of determining a partition @xmath74 , and sub - partitions @xmath75 , such that : a ) @xmath76 and b ) the partitions are suitable for generating a sparse representation of the signal in hand . as a first step we propose to tailor the partition to the signal @xmath11 by setting @xmath77 taking into account the critical points of the curvature function of the signal , i.e. , @xmath78 usually the entries in @xmath79 are choosen as the initial knots of @xmath77 . in order to obtain more knots we apply subdivision between consecutive knots in @xmath79 thereby obtaining a partition @xmath77 with the decided number of knots .    because most signals are processed with digital computers , one normally has to deal with a numerical representation of a signal in the form of sampling points .",
    "thus , another problem to be addressed is how to compute the entries in @xmath79 from the sequence of points @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the step length in the discretization .",
    "the algorithm below outlines a procedure for accomplishing the task .    the interval @xmath0 $ ] , the discrete signal @xmath82 , the subdivision level @xmath83 .",
    "the partition @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87    @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92    according to theorem [ th : dic ] , in order to build a dictionary for @xmath40 we need to choose @xmath54-subpartitions @xmath93 such that @xmath56 . as an example we suggest a simple method for producing @xmath54-subpartitions @xmath93 , which is used in the numerical simulations of the next section .",

    "we produce here three examples illustrating the potentiality of the proposed dictionaries for achieving sparse representations by nonlinear techniques .",
    "the signal we consider are the following :    * a chirp signal , @xmath104 , @xmath105,$ ] plotted in the top left of fig .  1 . * a seismic signal @xmath106 plotted in the top right graph of fig .  1 .",
    "this signal was taken from the wavelab802 toolbox .",
    "it is acknowledged there that the signal is distributed throughout the seismic industry as a test dataset . * a cosine function of random phase @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the piecewise constant function depicted in the bottom right of fig .  1",
    ". the left graph corresponds to the signal .",
    "[ f2 ]    = 7.5 cm = 7.5 cm + = 7.5 cm = 7.5 cm    the three signals are to be approximated up to a tolerance @xmath109 for the norm of the approximation s error .",
    "we deal with the chirp signal @xmath110 on the interval @xmath111 $ ] , by discretizing it into @xmath112 samples and applying algorithm 1 to produce the partition @xmath113 .",
    "the resulting number of knots is @xmath114 , which is enough to approximate the signal , by a cubic b - spline basis for the space , within the above specified precision @xmath115 .",
    "a dictionary @xmath116 for the identical space is constructed by considering 10 subpartitions , which yield @xmath117 functions .",
    "the signal @xmath106 is a piece of @xmath118 data .",
    "a partition of cardinality @xmath119 is obtained as @xmath120 and the dictionary of cubic splines we have used arises by considering @xmath121 subpartitions , which yields a dictionary @xmath122 of cardinality @xmath123 .",
    "the signal @xmath124 is discretized into @xmath112 samples .",
    "the partition @xmath125 produces @xmath126 knots . using @xmath127 subpartitions",
    "we build a dictionary @xmath128 of @xmath129 linear b - spline functions .    denoting by @xmath130 the atoms of the @xmath131th - dictionary",
    ", we look now for the subsets of indices @xmath132 of cardinality @xmath133 providing us with a sparse representation of the signals . in other words",
    ", we are interested in the approximations @xmath134 such that @xmath135 and the values @xmath133 are satisfactory small for the approximation to be considered sparse . since the problem of finding the sparsest solution is intractable , for all the signals we look for a satisfactory sparse representation using the same greedy strategy , which evolves by selecting atoms through stepwise minimization of the residual error as follows .",
    "i)the atoms are selected one by one according to the optimized orthogonal matching pursuit ( oomp ) method @xcite until the above defined tolerance for the norm of the residual error is reached .",
    "ii)the previous approximation is improved , without greatly increasing the computational cost , by a ` swapping refinement ' which at each step interchanges one atom of the atomic decomposition with a dictionary atom , provided that the operation decreases the norm of the residual error@xcite .",
    "iii)a backward - optimized orthogonal matching pursuit ( boomp ) method @xcite is applied to disregard some coefficients of the atomic decomposition , in order to produce an approximation up to the error of stage i ) .",
    "the last two steps are repeated until no further swapping is possible .",
    "let us stress that , if steps ii ) and iii ) can be executed at least once , the above strategy guarantees an improvement upon the results of oomp .",
    "the gain is with respect to the number of atoms involved in the approximation for the given error s norm .",
    "the described technique is applied to all the non - orthogonal dictionaries we have considered for comparison with the proposed approach .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 . in the first column",
    "we place the dictionaries to be compared .",
    "these are : 1 ) the spline basis for the space adapted to the corresponding signal , as proposed in sec  4 .",
    "as already mentioned , for signals @xmath110 and @xmath106 we use cubic b - splines and for signal @xmath124 the linear one .",
    "2 ) the dictionary for the identical spaces consisting of functions of larger support .",
    "3 ) the orthogonal cosine bases used by the discrete cosine transform ( dct ) .",
    "4 ) the semi - orthogonal cardinal chui - wang spline wavelet basis @xcite and 5 ) the chui - wang cardinal spline dictionary for the same space @xcite . for signals @xmath110 and",
    "@xmath106 we use cubic spline wavelets and for signal @xmath124 linear spline wavelets .    .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the last three columns of table 1 display the number of atoms involved in the atomic decomposition for each test signal and for each dictionary .",
    "these numbers clearly show a remarkable performance of the approximation produced by the proposed non - uniform b - spline dictionaries .",
    "notice that whilst the non - uniform spline space is adapted to the corresponding signal , only the dictionary for the space achieves the sparse representation .",
    "moreover the performance is superior to that of the chui - wang spline wavelet basis @xcite even for signal @xmath124 , which was specially selected because , due to the abrupt edges delimiting the smooth lines , is very appropriate to be approximated by wavelets .",
    "it is also worth stressing that for signal @xmath110 and @xmath106 the performance is similar to the cardinal chui - wang dictionary , which is known to render a very good representation for these signals @xcite .",
    "however , whilst the chui - wang cardinal spline wavelet dictionaries introduced in @xcite are significantly redundant with respect to the corresponding basis ( about twice as larger ) the non - uniform b - spline dictionaries introduced here contain a few more functions than the basis .",
    "nevertheless , as the examples of this section indicate , the improvement in the sparseness of the approximation a dictionary may yield with respect to the b - spline basis is enormous .",
    "still there is the issue of establishing how to decide on the number of subpartitions to be considered . for these numerical examples",
    "the number of subpartitions was fixed as the one producing the best result when allowing the number of subpartitions to vary within some range .",
    "it was observed that only for signal @xmath106 the optimum number of subpartitions produced results significantly better that all other values .",
    "conversely , from signals @xmath110 and @xmath124 some variations from the optimum number of subpartitions still produce comparable results .",
    "non - uniform b - spline dictionaries for adapted spline spaces have been introduced .",
    "the proposed dictionaries are built by dividing a given partition into subpartitions and merging the basis for the concomitant subspaces .",
    "the dictionary functions are characterized by having broader support than the basis functions for the identical space .",
    "the uniform b - spline dictionaries proposed in @xcite readily arise here as a particular case .    the capability of the non - uniform b - spline dictionaries to produce sparse signal representation has been illustrated by recourse to numerical simulations .",
    "thus , we feel confident that a number of applications could benefit from this construction , e.g. , we believe it could also be useful in computer - aided geometry design ( cagd ) , for reducing control points and for finding sparse knot sets of b - spline curves @xcite .",
