    "we apply a many - body beam splitter by allowing the atoms in each column to tunnel in a projected double - well potential . the resulting atom number parity , even or odd , on each site encodes the global and local purity . ]    for our experiments , we utilize a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath2rb atoms loaded into a two - dimensional optical lattice that lies at the focus of a high resolution imaging system  @xcite .",
    "the system is described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the bosonic creation , annihilation , and number operators at the site located at @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "atoms can tunnel between neighboring lattice sites at a rate @xmath8 and experience a pairwise interaction energy @xmath9 when multiple atoms occupy a site .",
    "we have independent control over the tunneling amplitudes @xmath10 and @xmath11 through the lattice depth , which can be tuned to yield @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the optical lattice , we are able to superimpose arbitrary potentials using a digital micromirror device ( dmd ) placed in the fourier plane of our imaging system  @xcite .        to initiate the experiment , we isolate a @xmath14 plaquette from a larger low - entropy mott insulator with unity filling as shown in figure  [ fig : protocol]a  @xcite . at this point , each system is in a product state of single - atom fock states on each of the constituent sites .",
    "we then suddenly switch on tunneling in the @xmath1-direction while the @xmath0-direction tunneling is suppressed .",
    "each chain is restricted to the original six sites by introducing a barrier at the ends of the chains to prevent tunneling out of the system .",
    "these combined steps quench the six - site chains into a hamiltonian for which the initial state represents a highly excited state that has significant overlap with an appreciable number of energy eigenstates .",
    "each chain represents an identical but independent copy of a quenched system of six particles on six sites , which evolves in the quenched hamiltonian for a controllable duration .    in the data that follow , we realize measurements of the quantum purity and on - site number statistics ( figure  [ fig : protocol]c ) . for measurements of the former ,",
    "we append to the quench evolution a beam splitter operation that interferes the two identical copies by freezing dynamics along the chain and allowing for tunneling in a projected double - well potential for a prescribed time  @xcite . in the last step for both measurements",
    ", a potential barrier is raised between the two copies and a one - dimensional time - of - flight in the direction transverse to the chain is performed to measure the resulting occupation on each site of each copy .",
    "the ability to measure quantum purity is crucial to assessing the role of entanglement in our system .",
    "tomography of the full quantum state would typically be required to extract the global purity , which is particularly challenging in the full 462-dimensional hilbert space defined by the itinerant particles in our system . furthermore , while in spin systems global rotations can be employed for tomography  @xcite , there is no known analogous scheme for extracting the full density matrix of a many - body state of itinerant particles .",
    "the many - body interference described here , however , allows us to extract quantities that are quadratic in the density matrix , such as the purity  @xcite . after performing the beam splitter operation ,",
    "we can obtain the quantum purity of the full system and any subsystem simply by counting the number of atoms on each site of one of the six - site chains ( figure  [ fig : protocol]c ) .",
    "each run of the experiment yields the parity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is iterated over a set of sites of interest in copy-@xmath17 .",
    "the single - site parity operator @xmath18 returns 1 ( -1 ) when the atom number on site-@xmath16 is even ( odd ) .",
    "it has been shown that the beam splitter operation yields @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the density matrix on the set of sites considered for each copy  @xcite .",
    "because the preparation and quench dynamics for each copy are identical , yielding @xmath21 , the average parity reduces to the purity : @xmath22 .",
    "when the set of sites considered comprises the full six - site chain , the expectation value of this quantity returns the global many - body purity , while for smaller sets it provides the local purity of the respective subsystem .    by studying measurements with and without the beam splitter",
    ", our data immediately illustrates the contrast between the global and local behavior and how thermalization is manifest ( figure  [ fig : protocol]b ) .",
    "we observe that the global many - body state retains its quantum purity in time , affirming the unitarity of its evolution following the quench .",
    "this global measurement also clearly distinguishes the quantum state we produce from a canonical thermal ensemble with orders of magnitude smaller purity . yet",
    ", we observe that the number statistics locally converge to a distribution of thermal character , which can be faithfully modeled by that same thermal ensemble . in",
    "what follows , we experimentally explore the question suggested by this observation : how does a pure state that appears globally distinct from a thermal ensemble possess local properties that mirror this thermal state ?    the growth of entanglement following a quench is key to understanding how entropy forms within the subsystems of a pure quantum state , thereby facilitating thermalization  @xcite .",
    "when two parts of a system are entangled , the full quantum state @xmath23 can not be written in a separable fashion with respect to the hilbert spaces of the subsystems  @xcite .",
    "as has been shown theoretically  @xcite and recently observed experimentally  @xcite , this causes the subsystems @xmath24 and @xmath25 to be in an entropic mixed state even though the full many - body quantum state is pure  @xcite .",
    "the mixedness of the subsystem can be quantified by the second - order rnyi entropy @xmath26)$ ] , which is the logarithm of the purity of the subsystem density matrix . while the von neumann entropy is typically used in the context of statistical mechanics ,",
    "both quantities grow as a subsystem density matrix becomes mixed and increasingly entropic . in the rnyi case",
    ", the purity in the logarithm quantifies the number of states contributing to the statistical mixture described by the density matrix .",
    "we first study the dynamics of the entanglement entropy immediately following the quench , for varying subsystem sizes ( figure  [ fig : eedyn ] ) .",
    "initially , we observe an approximately linear rise in the entropy , with similar slope among the subsystems considered ( figure  [ fig : eedyn ] inset )  @xcite . after an amount of time that depends on the subsystem size , the entanglement entropy saturates to a steady - state value ,",
    "about which there are small residual temporal fluctuations .",
    "the presence of residual fluctuations are , in part , attributable to the finite - size of our system .",
    "an exact numerical calculation of the dynamics with no free parameters shows excellent agreement with our experimental measurements .",
    "crucially , the data indicate that while the subsystems acquire entropy in time ( figure  [ fig : eedyn],a - c ) , the full system entropy remains constant and is small throughout the dynamics ( figure  [ fig : eedyn]d ) . the high purity of the full system allows us to conclude that the dynamical increase in entropy in the subsystems originates in the propagation of entanglement between the system s constituents .",
    "the approximately linear rise at early times ( figure  [ fig : eedyn ] inset ) is related to the spreading of entanglement in the system within an effective light cone  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in analogy to the growth of thermodynamic entropy in an equilibrating classical mechanical system , such as a gas in a closed container , we observe the growth of local entropy in a closed quantum mechanical system . in the quantum mechanical case , however , the mechanism responsible for entropy is entanglement , which is absent from a system modeled by classical mechanics .",
    "when a system thermalizes , we expect that the saturated values of local observables should correspond to the predictions of a statistical ensemble . by analogy ,",
    "if the entanglement entropy plays the role of thermal entropy , then in a thermalized pure state we expect extensive growth in the entanglement entropy with subsystem volume . when the entanglement entropy in a quantum state grows linearly with the size of the subsystem considered , it is known as a volume law .",
    "ground - breaking theoretical work using conformal field theory has shown that indeed , at long times , a volume law is expected for a quenched , infinite , continuous system , while only an area law with a log correction is expected for the ground state  @xcite . characterizing the large amount of entanglement associated with a volume law is particularly challenging because it results in nearly every entry of the density matrix having small , but importantly non - zero magnitude .    using the techniques outlined in this work , we show measurements displaying a near volume law in the entanglement entropy ( figure  [ fig : volume]a ) .",
    "a linear growth with volume in the entanglement entropy occurs when each subsystem incoherently populates a number of states that scales with the size of the subsystem hilbert space .",
    "this is because , for the bose - hubbard model , the hilbert space is approximately exponential in the lattice size , which results in a linear growth in @xmath27)$ ] .",
    "furthermore , the exact slope of the entanglement entropy versus subsystem volume depends on the average energy of the thermalized pure state  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , we can prepare the ground state of the quenched hamiltonian by adiabatically reducing the lattice depth . here , the superfluid ground state of the bose - hubbard model has suppressed entanglement , which is predicted to incur slow logarithmic growth in the entanglement entropy with subsystem volume  @xcite .",
    "our measurements clearly distinguish the two cases .",
    "the back - bending of the entanglement entropy as the subsystem surpasses half the system size indicates that the state is globally pure . in the quenched state ,",
    "the high global purity is striking in a state that locally appears completely dephased , which is behavior often associated with environmentally - induced decoherence or other noise sources .",
    "we further observe near quantitative agreement between the exact dependence of the entanglement entropy with subsystem volume and the prediction of a thermal ensemble .",
    "we make this comparison by computing a canonical thermal ensemble @xmath28 with an average energy that is the same as the quenched quantum state produced experimentally  @xcite . the gray line in figure  [ fig : volume]a is the rnyi ( thermal ) entropy as a function of subsystem size for this calculated thermal state .",
    "although our limited system size prevents comparison over a large range of subsystem sizes , the initial rise of the entanglement entropy with subsystem volume mimics that of the thermal entropy . despite their similarity , it is worth emphasizing the disparate character of the thermal and entanglement entropy .",
    "the entanglement entropy ( either the rnyi or von neumann ) is instantaneously present in the pure quantum state after coherent unitary evolution , arising from the non - separability of the quantum state between the subsystem and traced out degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "the von neumann thermal entropy within a subsystem of a mixed thermal state is the thermodynamic entropy in statistical mechanics , which could be extracted from irreversible heat flow experiments on the subsystem  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the similarity of the rnyi entropies we observe points to an experimental equivalence between the entanglement and thermodynamic entropy  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the entanglement entropy provides a clean framework for understanding the entropy within thermalizing , closed quantum systems .",
    "however , one of the most famous features of entanglement , the presence of non - local correlations , appears inconsistent with what one expects of thermalized systems .",
    "in particular , the massive amount of entanglement implied by a volume law suggests a large amount of correlation between disparate parts of the system , while a key feature of a thermal state is the very absence of these long - range correlations .",
    "a useful metric for correlations , both classical ( statistical ) and quantum , between two subsystems @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the mutual information @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the mutual information demonstrates that the amount of correlation in the presence of a volume law is vanishing for subsystem volumes that sample less than half the full system , which is where the entropy growth is nearly linear ( figure  [ fig : volume]b , c ) .",
    "furthermore , even though the thermalized quantum state carries more entanglement entropy than the ground state , small subsystems display smaller correlations than in the superfluid ground state .",
    "once the subsystem volume is comparable to the system size , which is where the entanglement entropy deviates from the volume law , the quantum correlations entailed by the purity of the full system become apparent ( figure  [ fig : volume]c ) .",
    "the mutual information therefore illustrates how the volume law in the entanglement entropy yields an absence of correlations between sufficiently local observables , even though the quantum state retains a large amount of entanglement .",
    ", the saturated average particle number on each site ( density ) is nearly equal among the sites of the system , which resembles a system at thermal equilibrium . by comparison ,",
    "the ground state for the same bose - hubbard parameters has significant curvature . *",
    "( b ) * in measuring the probabilities to observe a given particle number on a single site , we can obtain the local , single - site density matrix and observe the approach to thermalization . using two different metrics , we compare the mixed state observed to the mixed state derived from the subsystem of a canonical thermal ensemble , after a quench to @xmath32 .",
    "the trace distance provides an effective distance between the mixed states in hilbert space , while the fidelity is an overlap measure for mixed states .",
    "the two metrics illustrate how the pure state subsystem approaches the thermal ensemble subsystem shortly after the quench .",
    "the starting value of these quantities is given by the overlap of the initial pure state with the thermal mixed state .",
    "solid lines connect the data points . ]",
    "our comparisons between the entanglement entropy and thermal entropy suggest that the pure quantum state we study possesses thermalized properties",
    ". we can further examine the presence of thermalization by performing a series of measurements of local observables against which we compare the predictions of various thermal ensembles . as with the entanglement entropy",
    ", we also contrast our observations of the quenched thermalized state with the adiabatically prepared ground state . in figure  [ fig : local]a , we display the in - situ number density distribution on the six sites for the saturated quenched state and the ( superfluid ) ground state . while the ground state exhibits significant curvature , the quenched state exhibits a flat density distribution .",
    "this flat density distribution is consistent with a picture in which the constituents of the many - body system collectively thermalize , so that each site is in equilibrium with its neighbors and physically similar .    we can perform a more rigorous test of single - site thermalization by comparing the measured density matrix of each site with the reduced density matrix of a canonical thermal ensemble @xmath33 ( figure  [ fig : local]b ) .",
    "our measurements of probabilities to observe a given particle number on a site completely characterize that single - site density matrix , because there are no coherences between different number states due to super - selection rules . with this measured density matrix",
    ", we can perform a quantitative comparison to a thermal ensemble using the trace distance ( @xmath34 ) and quantum fidelity ( @xmath35 ) , both of which quantify the similarity of two mixed quantum states . after a short time",
    ", we see a quantum fidelity exceeding @xmath36 and a trace - distance that fluctuates between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , indicating the similarity between the local density matrix of a verified pure state with the local density matrix of a thermal state .",
    "the correspondence between the observables of a pure state and thermal state depends on the equivalence of their reduced density matrices within the hilbert space sampled by the observable . the measurement of figure  [ fig : local]b therefore shows that observables for the single - site hilbert space should agree with the predictions of thermal ensembles .",
    "we now focus on direct comparisons of observables with various thermal ensembles , and the theoretical justification for doing so .",
    "while we have focused on the role of entanglement entropy in producing thermal characteristics , the eigenstate distribution resulting from a quench ( figure  [ fig : eth]a ) determines the dynamics of observables , as well as their subsequent saturated values .",
    "it follows then that these populated eigenstates should clarify the origin of thermalization , which is the goal of eth .",
    "the underlying explanation for eth is that thermalizing , non - integrable systems possess excited eigenstates that look like nearly random vectors , or , equivalently , are described by a hamiltonian that approximately conforms to random matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "that is , for most bases , each eigenvector projects onto each basis vector with random quantum amplitude .",
    "the diffuse probability distribution of the eigenstates in most bases , such as the fock state basis , is analogous to the chaotic dynamics of a closed classical mechanical system passing through every allowed point of phase space , and in the quantum case this has several consequences .",
    "surprisingly , this chaotic assumption can be adapted to explain the saturation of measurement observables , the agreement of these saturated observables with thermal ensembles , and the presence of a volume law in the entanglement entropy  @xcite . and",
    "so , while in classical mechanical systems it is the chaos in the temporal dynamics that leads to entropy maximization and thermalization within thermodynamic constraints , in quantum thermalizing systems it is chaos in the energy eigenstates that generates the analogous behavior in the entanglement entropy , and , in turn , thermalization .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eth]c , d , we compare our measurements to the predictions of thermal ensembles that are illustrated in figure  [ fig : eth]b .",
    "we also compare our results to a grand - canonical ensemble truncated to our total atom number  @xcite : this ensemble perhaps most closely models how well the many - body state can act as a reservoir for its constituent subsystems . for each single - site and three - site",
    "observable , we show the atom number distributions for two different effective temperatures of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are achieved by quenching to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . the data is averaged in the saturated regime over times between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and the error bars are the standard deviation in the measured probabilities .",
    "the consistency within the the error bars indicates that in this temporal range our observations remain near the thermal predictions despite the presence of temporal fluctuations . for the single site subsystem ,",
    "the data is in good agreement with all the ensembles considered . despite the fact that the quenched state is in a large distribution of eigenstates , surprisingly , we find favorable agreement for the case of a single eigenstate ensemble : this illustrates a key principle of eth , which holds that the reduced density matrix , and associated observables , vary slowly from eigenstate to eigenstate and are therefore relatively insensitive to breadth of the distribution of populated states from the quench .",
    "we perform the same comparisons to the three - site case in the bottom two panels . here",
    "we also observe agreement with most ensembles , though , interestingly , there is relatively less agreement with the single eigenstate and grand - canonical ensembles , particularly for the lower temperature quench .",
    "this variation in agreement may suggest that these ensembles are more sensitive to the relative size of the traced out reservoir compared to the subsystem , which indicates directions of further experiments  @xcite .",
    "the above measurements were on specific subsystems , but our measurements also allow extraction of the average global interaction energy ( figure  [ fig : eth]d ) . since the interaction term in eq .",
    "[ bhm ] is diagonal in the fock - state basis , we can use our measurements of the final particle configurations to compute the expectation value @xmath45 . for the @xmath46 data ,",
    "we show a time scan indicating the initial growth in this quantity , which starts at zero since the initial state is a single particle per site .",
    "these observations , at long times , are in near agreement with the canonical prediction .",
    "interestingly , this measurement is sensitive to the entire six - site system as opposed to some subset of sites , which might suggest that it is global and unlikely to thermalize .",
    "yet , @xmath45 undergoes thermalization because it is a sum of local operators , each of which thermalizes and is insensitive to the global purity of the full system .",
    "the observed agreement is consistent with the idea that only a small set of operators , such as the global purity we measure or other specific fine - tuned state projectors , can truly distinguish the pure state we produce from a thermal state .",
    "our observations speak to a natural translation between thermalizing quantum mechanical and classical mechanical systems composed of itinerant particles .",
    "classical statistical mechanics relies on a fundamental assumption : a system in thermal equilibrium can be found in any microstate compatible with the thermodynamic constraints imposed on the system , and , as such , is described by an ensemble of maximal entropy  @xcite .",
    "although it is vastly successful , classical statistical mechanics does not itself justify this entropy maximization for closed systems  @xcite , and an open systems approach only defers the question of thermalization to the union of the bath and system  @xcite . while ergodicity and time - averaging can provide a justification for entropy maximization in closed classical mechanical systems , ergodicity is not applicable on the same scale that statistical mechanics is successful , and",
    "time - averaging can require exponentially long times  @xcite .",
    "the latter also obscures the fact that there is in reality only one system , which , nevertheless , is well - modeled by an entropic ensemble  @xcite . our studies , and beautiful recent theoretical work  @xcite , hint towards a microscopic origin for entropy maximization in a single quantum state , namely that induced by the entanglement we measure .",
    "quantum mechanics does not require time - averaging or thorny issues therein : a single quantum state obtains thermalized local observables , and these observables can not distinguish this thermalized pure state from a mixed thermal ensemble of the same thermodynamic character .",
    "our measurements open up several avenues for further investigation . instead of operating with fixed total system size , we can study how thermalization and fluctuations depend on the size of the system considered  @xcite .",
    "conversely , studying integrable hamiltonians where thermalization fails  @xcite , and the structure of the associated eigenstate spectrum of such systems , could allow direct tests of the relationship between conserved quantities and thermalization of a quantum state .",
    "lastly , applying these tools for characterizing the presence of thermalization and entanglement entropy could be powerful in studying many - body localization , where one of the key experimental signatures is the logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy at long times and suppression of precisely the thermalization we measure here  @xcite .",
