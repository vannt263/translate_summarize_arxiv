    "one of the remarkable features of the @xmath3 known extrasolar planets is their relatively high eccentricities , most far larger than seen in the giant planets of the solar system .",
    "many mechanisms to produce these high - eccentricity orbits have been offered .",
    "the most popular involve planet - planet gravitational scattering @xcite , either through close encounters , physical collisions , secular interactions or resonant interactions .",
    "other eccentricity excitation mechanisms include interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary disk @xcite , or interactions with the planetesimal disk @xcite .",
    "all of these proposed mechanisms have shortcomings .",
    "planet - planet scattering through close encounters appears to create the wrong eccentricity distribution  there may be too many planets on low - eccentricity orbits , formed by physical collisions or tidal captures during the scattering process ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "discussions of eccentricity excitation through mean - motion resonances assume that planet - disk interactions induce evolution of semimajor axes leading to resonant capture , but neglect the effects of these interactions on eccentricity .",
    "interactions with the gaseous planetesimal disk can either damp or excite eccentricity , depending sensitively on the formation of gaps at lindblad resonances , nonlinear saturation of corotation resonances @xcite , and the rate of viscous diffusion across resonances @xcite , all of which are difficult to calculate reliably .",
    "excitation through interactions with the planetesimal disk may require more massive disks than are indicated by observations and may only be efficient for companions with masses much higher than those of most extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "there is strong and growing evidence that most forming stars are surrounded by extended disks , with radii of hundreds of au .",
    "this evidence includes co observations of massive gas disks around young stars , disks detected in orion and other star - forming regions by optical emission from their photoionized surfaces , the infrared excess at wavelengths of 25100@xmath4 discovered by iras around bright nearby stars such as vega , dust disks found optically around nearby stars such as @xmath5 pictoris , and imaging by the nicmos camera on the hubble space telescope of near - infrared radiation scattered by dusty disks around stars such as hr 4796 ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "it may well be that the dust around older stars such as vega and @xmath5 pictoris is `` second - generation '' dust , released in collisions between larger objects ( planetesimals or comets ) that were formed by the accretion of primordial or first - generation dust particles .",
    "thus the absence of dust around older stars may arise either because the dust has been dispersed or destroyed or because it has been incorporated into larger bodies such as planets .",
    "indirect evidence for planets at large distances from the host stars comes from the morphologies of the dust debris disks of vega and @xmath6 eri .",
    "disk asymmetries and dust concentrations are often interpreted as resulting from the dynamical influence of an unseen massive planet .",
    "modeling suggests that the planetary companion has a semimajor axis @xmath7 au in the vega system @xcite and about 5565 au in the @xmath6 eri system @xcite .",
    "formation of giant planets by core accretion is difficult at these distances , and it has been suggested that planets can migrate outward to distances of up to tens of au through interactions with the gas disk in young systems @xcite .",
    "we propose to explore the possibility that the eccentricities of the extrasolar planets arise because of secular interactions in a long - lived extended planetary or protoplanetary disk .",
    "we suggest that eccentricities are excited in the outer part of the disk by a passing star and propagate inward through the disk , somewhat like a wave .",
    "we explore how the inward propagation of eccentricity in disks depends on the overall surface - density distribution .",
    "in section [ sec_secular ] we review the definitions and the approach of secular perturbation theory . in section [ sec_excit ]",
    "we describe the initial excitation of the eccentricity and in section [ sec_prop ] we study the propagation of eccentricities via secular interactions .",
    "we discuss typical eccentricities produced by this mechanism in section [ sec_disc ] and conclude in section [ sec_conc ] .",
    "in this section we consider a planetary system around a star with mass @xmath8 .",
    "there are @xmath9 planets with masses @xmath10 and orbital elements @xmath11 ( semimajor axes ) , @xmath12 ( eccentricities ) , @xmath13 ( longitudes of pericenter ) and @xmath14 ( mean motions ) , where @xmath15 .",
    "the index @xmath16 runs from the inner to the outer planet , and sets of @xmath9 values can be treated as vectors .",
    "we assume that the parameters of the planetary system are such that the mean - motion resonances can be neglected .",
    "so long as the eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits remain small , the secular evolution of the system can be investigated using laplace - lagrange theory @xcite .",
    "specifically , with the change of variables @xmath17 the equations that describe the evolution of eccentricities and the motions of the pericenters of the orbits are @xmath18 the matrix @xmath19 is completely determined by the masses and semimajor axes of the planets and the mass of the central star . in this approximation , eccentricities @xmath12 and longitudes of pericenter @xmath13 are not coupled to inclinations @xmath20 and longitudes of ascending nodes @xmath21 .",
    "the planets can be treated as coupled harmonic oscillators , and the time evolution of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a superposition of oscillations with frequencies determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath24 and with amplitudes determined by the initial conditions and the eigenvectors of @xmath24 .",

    "this value can be computed from the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath19 and the eccentricity components for all planets at some time @xmath43 : @xmath44    mean square eccentricities can be used to quantify the response of the system to an external perturbation  for example , another star passing not far from the planetary system . before and after the perturbation , when the perturber is far enough so that its potential can be neglected compared to the potential of the central star and the planets , the planetary system evolves according to secular perturbation theory , as long as eccentricities and inclinations remain small . in this case , the mean square eccentricities after the perturbation are @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the changes in the eccentricity components due to the perturbation that are weighted similarly to ( [ weight ] ) to obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "in this section we calculate the response of the planets to an external perturber , which is quantified by the values @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the notation of the previous section .",
    "this response can be obtained by numerical integration of the equations of motion in an arbitrary geometry of the perturbation but for simplicity we consider the two - dimensional case , when the perturber , the central star and the planets are coplanar at all times .",
    "we also neglect the interaction between the planets during the perturbation .",
    "this is justified as long as the characteristic timescale of the perturbation is much shorter than the timescales of secular evolution , which we estimate as inverse secular eigenfrequencies of the system @xmath52 .",
    "the perturber has a mass @xmath53 and when it is far from the system it moves with velocity @xmath54 and impact parameter @xmath55 relative to the central star ( figure [ pic_impact ] ) .",
    "the equations of motion of the external perturber and of the planet @xmath56 relative to the central star are @xmath57 here the contribution to the potential from the planets is neglected during the perturbation ; the planets move as test particles in the potential field of the central star and the external perturber .",
    "the trajectory of the perturber relative to the central star is a hyperbola .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the cases when the perturber passes outside the planetary system , so that the distance of the closest approach of the perturber is @xmath58 .",
    "the excited eccentricities remain the same if the parameters are rescaled so that @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 because the timescale of the perturbation @xmath62 scales as @xmath63 , in the same way as does the orbital period of the planet .",
    "this can be seen from equations ( [ impact ] ) which are invariant to such change of variables .    as a result of the interaction with the central star the perturber deviates from its original trajectory by an angle",
    "@xmath64 a perturbing star that moves with a velocity @xmath65 proceeds almost along a straight line with almost constant velocity . in this case ( which we refer to as a `` fast perturber '' ) some simple approximate solutions of equations ( [ impact ] ) can be obtained analytically . in section [ fast_perturber ]",

    "the expected number of encounters within a given impact parameter is similar in the solar neighborhood and in a rich open cluster ; the large density of stars in the latter compensates for the short life - time and slow velocities .",
    "the result is that eccentricities acquired at the birthplace of stars during the first 10@xmath119 years are much higher than those that can be generated during the subsequent evolution in a low - density environment . in what follows",
    "we will thus concentrate on slow encounters .",
    "after the perturber is gone , the excited eccentricities are redistributed in the system due to the secular interactions described in section [ sec_secular ] . as a first example",
    ", we consider a planetary system around a solar mass star consisting of 10 planets with their semimajor axes following a geometric progression from 1 au to 100 au , with @xmath120 .",
    "the masses increase as a geometric progression , too , with the innermost planet having the mass of 0.1 @xmath121 and with @xmath122 .",
    "the outer planet has then a mass of @xmath123 .",
    "the planets were on circular orbits before the perturbation , and the orbital phases at the moment of the closest approach @xmath74 were selected randomly .",
    "the perturber is in prograde motion relative to the planets .",
    "the evolution of the eccentricity of the innermost planet is shown in figure [ pic_example ] ( top ) .",
    "if there were no other planets in the system , a perturber passing with an impact parameter of 400 au and with velocity @xmath116 km sec@xmath67 would only excite an eccentricity of @xmath124 .",
    "however , secular interactions with other planets bring the eccentricity up to a maximum of 0.015 . the rms eccentricity can be found from equation ( [ eccent_p ] ) to be @xmath125 .    in a more extreme example",
    "given in figure [ pic_example ] , bottom , the spacing between the planets is the same but the masses increase from @xmath126 to @xmath127 with @xmath128 . in this case",
    "secular interactions in the extended planetary system bring the eccentricity of the innermost planet up to 0.25 , with an rms value of @xmath129 .    in both examples ,",
    "the presence of outer planets made the perturbation much more efficient in exciting the eccentricity of the inner planet .",
    "we define for the inner planet an excitation efficiency parameter which is the ratio of the rms eccentricity after the perturbation to the value of eccentricity that would have been excited if there were no other planets : @xmath130 in the cases considered above , the excitation efficiency for the inner planet is @xmath131 ( figure [ pic_example ] top ) and @xmath132 ( figure [ pic_example ] bottom ) .",
    "another important parameter is the ratio of the eccentricities of the innermost and the outermost planets .",
    "if this ratio is @xmath133 , the eccentricity of the innermost planet can not be excited significantly without ejecting the outer planet .",
    "we define a propagation efficiency parameter : @xmath134 in the case of our example system in figure [ pic_example ] ( top ) , the rms eccentricity of the outermost planet @xmath135 , so the propagation efficiency is @xmath136 . in the second example ( figure [ pic_example ] bottom ) ,",
    "@xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "so in fact , the final rms eccentricity of the innermost planet is the largest in this system even though this planet is least affected by the direct interaction with the perturber .",
    "both efficiency parameters are quite high for our example systems , but they depend significantly on the mass distribution .",
    "the latter can be parametrized by the surface density that is obtained by smearing out the mass of all planets in such a way that the mass in the annulus between @xmath11 and @xmath139 is @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting smeared - out surface density is a power law as a function of the distance from the central star , and the power index is related to the ratios of semimajor axes and masses : @xmath140    we now proceed to investigate how the efficiencies @xmath141 and @xmath142 depend on the parameters of the planetary system .",
    "we calculated rms eccentricities for 16,000 simulated systems , with the total number of planets @xmath9 ranging from 5 to 20 .",
    "the planets follow a geometric progression in semimajor axes and masses quantified by the parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "all planets move in the same direction and are on initially circular orbits , and the perturber always has the same parameters ( @xmath99 , @xmath115 au , @xmath116 km sec@xmath67 ) . for each @xmath9 , the parameter @xmath145",
    "was selected randomly , with the maximum size of the system @xmath146 restricted to be in the range 50200 au . for each pair",
    "@xmath147 the parameter @xmath148 was selected randomly , but the ratio of the maximum mass to the minimum mass was not to exceed @xmath149 . for each set",
    "@xmath150 we selected random sets of phases @xmath74 and calculated the resulting rms eccentricities for both prograde and retrograde motions of the perturber relative to the planets .",
    "the innermost planet was placed at 1 au from the central star in all systems , so that in all systems @xmath151    in figure [ pic_stat ] we plot the rms eccentricity of the innermost planet and the propagation efficiency for this planet as a function of the surface density index @xmath152 .",
    "most notably , both the excited eccentricity and the propagation efficiency are high in systems with flat mass distributions @xmath1 .",
    "prograde encounters are , on average , about ten times more efficient in exciting the eccentricity than retrograde encounters .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ pic_stat ] that high eccentricities can be excited for flat density distributions .",
    "the laplace - lagrange secular perturbation theory can not be used for eccentricities approaching unity , and therefore we do not show systems with @xmath153 ( numerical integrations showing the effects of secular interactions of high - eccentricity planets are discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "we also do not show systems in which the outer planet is ejected as a result of the direct interaction with the perturber ( this occurred in about 9% of systems with sizes in excess of 100 au ; all planets with semimajor axes less than 100 au remained bound to the central star ) .",
    "our simulated systems occupy only a narrow locus on the @xmath152 vs efficiency diagrams , but this effect is artificial and is introduced by the restrictions we imposed on the simulated systems . in particular , we allowed only a narrow range of total sizes of the systems ( 50200 au ) .",
    "it is natural to assume that the excited eccentricities also depend on the total size of the system and , regardless of the mass distribution , high eccentricity can not be excited in small systems .",
    "we therefore added to our simulation 11,000 more systems with sizes in the range 10 au @xmath154 50 au and studied the dependence of the excited eccentricity on the total size of the system . for the encounter that we studied ( @xmath115 au , @xmath116 km sec@xmath67 ) , the excited eccentricity is almost insensitive to size for 50 au @xmath154 200 au , but drops significantly for smaller systems ( figure [ pic_size ] ) .    within the laplace - lagrange theory the final eccentricities",
    "do not depend on the overall mass scaling , but only on the ratios of the masses of the planets .",
    "the stability of the system , however , depends on the actual masses .",
    "@xcite gives a stability criterion for two - planet systems ; if this criterion is applied to our simulations , the planetary system is stable if @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the maximum mass of the planets in the system and @xmath8 is the mass of the host star .",
    "all simulations with @xmath157 and the total sizes @xmath158 au are stable by this criterion if @xmath159 .",
    "if higher masses are allowed , the stability criterion limits the number of planets in the system .",
    "for example , if @xmath160 , then only systems with @xmath161 can be stable .",
    "the actual requirements for the long - term stability of multi - planet systems are likely to be somewhat more severe than gladman s criterion suggests .",
    "both excitation and propagation efficiencies are insensitive to the number of the planets in the system , and excluding unstable systems does not affect any results of our analysis .",
    "we also performed the same simulations for fast encounters ( @xmath115 au , @xmath101 km sec@xmath67 ) .",
    "the excited eccentricities are typically about two magnitudes lower than in the case of slow encounters , in agreement with figure [ pic_example ] , but the propagation efficiencies are very similar to those shown in figure [ pic_stat ] .",
    "the main factors governing the efficiency of the eccentricity excitation and propagation are the total size of the planetary system and its large - scale surface density distribution , with efficient eccentricity excitation and propagation in systems with @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is valid both for fast and slow encounters that we examined .",
    "we showed that encounters with nearby stars can excite the eccentricities of the outer planets , which can then propagate to the inner planets .",
    "eccentricity propagation is efficient for flat mass distributions of the planetary system .",
    "we now discuss the typical values of eccentricities excited by this mechanism in different environments .    in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "all encounters are fast by criterion ( [ cond_fast ] ) , and the impulse approximation works fairly well for planets at radii of a few tens of au ( figure [ pic_excit ] top ) .",
    "after the eccentricity excitation propagates to the innermost planet , its rms eccentricity becomes @xmath162 for @xmath163 .",
    "we have averaged over all phases of closest approach in equation ( [ fast ] ) .    in an open cluster ,",
    "the secular approximation ( [ approx_rasio ] ) sets a lower bound on the excited eccentricity ( figure [ pic_excit ] bottom ) , and for planets at radii larger than 50 au the average excited eccentricities are about a factor of 3 larger than those given by the secular approximation ( [ approx_rasio ] ) .",
    "the rms eccentricity of the inner planet is then @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "typical eccentricities excited in dense open clusters are a factor of 20 greater than those that can be excited by field stars in the solar neighborhood . in the simulations shown in figure [ pic_stat ] propagation efficiencies of @xmath166",
    "were achieved for flat mass distributions ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "if such propagation efficiencies are common , the high eccentricities typical of those observed in extrasolar planets can be produced by close encounters in birth clusters during the @xmath110 years after the stars and planetary systems are formed .",
    "future observations of systems containing extrasolar planets may determine whether there is enough mass in the outer parts of these systems for the suggested mechanism to be efficient .",
    "the observation times required to detect radial velocity signatures from companions at radii @xmath167 au are prohibitively long , but such objects can be detected directly by infrared imaging using the _ spitzer _ telescope or by high - contrast imaging .",
    "the suggested mechanism also operates if the mass in the outer parts of the system is in the form of planetesimals .",
    "the detectability of such disks depend on their physical conditions .",
    "the probability that the closest encounter during the life time of the system @xmath168 is @xmath55 or smaller is given by poisson s formula : @xmath169 here @xmath170 is the number density of the stars that act as perturbers .",
    "therefore , about 10% of all stars experience very close encounters ( within 200 au ) . in these cases",
    "the excited eccentricity can be very high even for field encounters in the solar neighborhood and is very sensitive to the size of the system and the phase of the outer planet at closest approach of the perturber .",
    "the eccentricities of most extrasolar planets are much larger than those of giant planets in the solar system .",
    "this observation requires explanation because planets that form from a protoplanetary disk are expected to have nearly circular orbits . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility that close stellar encounters can excite planetary eccentricities .",
    "encounters with nearby stars can be dynamically important for the outer parts of circumstellar disks and planetary systems .",
    "@xcite studied pumping up of eccentricities and inclinations of planetesimals in a close stellar encounter . @xcite and @xcite suggested that encounters with nearby stars can be responsible for asymmetries in the @xmath5 pictoris disk .",
    "@xcite found that most planets are stripped from their host stars by encounters with neighbor stars in the dense centers of globular clusters .    in the solar neighborhood or an in open cluster the eccentricities of short - period planets",
    "can not be excited directly by perturbations from nearby stars to any significant values because such planets are tightly bound to their host star .",
    "we suggest here that if there are other planets or a significant mass in smaller bodies in the same system on larger orbits , the outer planets can be excited to high eccentricities and then transfer this excitation to inner planets through secular perturbations .    the extent to which the eccentricity of the innermost planets can be excited depends on the total size of the planetary system and on its smeared - out surface density distribution .",
    "if the smeared - out surface density distribution is parametrized by a power law , @xmath0 , then the proposed mechanism is important for systems with @xmath1 and with total size @xmath171 au .",
    "at least some gas disks around young stars show flat density distributions with @xmath172 @xcite and extend out to tens or hundreds of au",
    ". theoretical models of steady - state protoplanetary disks also suggest flat surface density distributions @xcite .",
    "it appears that the maximum lifetime of such gas disks is @xmath173 years @xcite ; some of this material may dissipate , but much or most of it may survive as planets or large planetesimals .",
    "outward migration of planets can also yield massive planets at a few tens of au @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the asymmetries in the dust debris disks in some systems may be due to unseen planets at radii @xmath174 au @xcite .    if the mass distribution is flat and the planetary system is large , the inner planets can be excited to high eccentricities ( 0.1@xmath1751 , eq . [ eps_open ] ) due to encounters in rich birth clusters .",
    "the typical eccentricities that can be excited by the described mechanism from field star encounters in the solar neighborhood are smaller ( 0.01@xmath1750.1 , eq . [ eps_solar ] )",
    ". a small fraction of stars ( 10% ) experience very close encounters with field stars ( within 200 au ) in which excited eccentricities can be much higher .",
    "all the calculations were done under a simplifying assumption that the perturber is moving in the same plane as the planets .",
    "@xcite argued that the eccentricities excited by a passing star are insensitive to the inclination of the perturber relative to the planetary disk and lie in the range determined by coplanar prograde and retrograde encounters .",
    "therefore , our conclusions about the eccentricity excitation and propagation are likely to be independent of the inclination of the perturber . in the case",
    "when the trajectory of the perturber is inclined relative to the plane of the planetary system , inclinations of the outer planets in the system can be excited and then propagate inward , similarly to propagation of eccentricities that we discussed in this paper .",
    "warps in circumstellar disks like those seen in @xmath5 pictoris @xcite may be signatures of inclination waves propagating through the system after the initial perturbation .    in this work",
    "our focus was to find the conditions for efficient propagation of eccentricity disturbances . in our simulations , the masses and semimajor axes of successive planets follow geometric progressions .",
    "clearly , these special configurations do not represent the full range of properties of real systems .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss the distribution of eccentricities resulting from our simulations in relation to the observed distribution .",
