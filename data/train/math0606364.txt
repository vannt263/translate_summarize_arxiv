    "<S> the @xmath0-convolution algebra of a semilattice is known to have trivial cohomology in degrees 1,2 and 3 whenever the coefficient bimodule is symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this result to all cohomology groups of degree @xmath1 with symmetric coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> our techniques prove a stronger splitting result , namely that the splitting can be made natural with respect to the underlying semilattice .        </S>",
    "<S> introduction let @xmath2 be a _ commutative _ semigroup and @xmath3 its associated banach convolution algebra . </S>",
    "<S> grnbk proved in @xcite that @xmath4 is amenable if and only if @xmath2 is a finite semilattice of abelian groups . </S>",
    "<S> rather than asking about amenability , we can investigate when the hochschild cohomology groups @xmath5 vanish for various @xmath6 and specific classes of @xmath4-bimodules @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , calculating @xmath8 has proved hard even when @xmath7 is a symmetric @xmath4-module .    </S>",
    "<S> progress has been made in the case where @xmath2 is a , that is , a commutative semigroup where every element is idempotent </S>",
    "<S> . if @xmath2 is a semilattice , then by an old result of duncan and namioka @xmath4 is amenable if and only if @xmath2 is finite ( see @xcite , theorem 10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , dales and duncan observed in @xcite that @xmath9 for all semilattices @xmath2 and all symmetric @xmath4-bimodules @xmath7 , and this has been extended to the third cohomology groups in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this note we extend these results to all higher cohomology groups ( the precise statement will be given in section [ s : state_thm ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the actual calculations used to prove our main result generalise familiar _ ad hoc _ arguments ; our contribution is to put these arguments into a systematic framework , by using some basic language and ideas from category theory to `` formalise '' the process for solving the cohomology problems .    let us review the structure of this paper . for readers unfamiliar with semigroups and their convolution algebras , we give the basic definitions and some examples . </S>",
    "<S> this is followed by a brief resum on banach algebras and their cohomology theory .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result ( theorem [ t : result ] ) is stated in section [ s : state_thm ] ; a special case is established in section [ s : finite_free ] , which will turn out to be the kernel for the proof of the general case . </S>",
    "<S> section [ s : formalsub ] contains the algebraic machinery which will be used to boost the results of section [ s : finite_free ] up to the general case , and section [ s : mainthm ] assembles the preceding work to give the main result . </S>",
    "<S> it is slightly unusual that the final proof is intrinsically inductive ( on the degree of homology ) .    </S>",
    "<S> background and definitions[s : background ] we refer to standard references such as @xcite for the definitions of banach algebras and bimodules over them . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , recall that if @xmath10 is a banach algebra with identity @xmath11 and @xmath7 a banach @xmath10-bimodule , then @xmath7 is said to be ( @xcite ,  9 , defn 11 ) if @xmath12    semigroup algebras and monoid algebras let @xmath2 be a semigroup . </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath4 the ( for the full definition , see e.g. @xcite  1 , example 23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this construction is functorial : more precisely , @xmath13 defines a functor from the category @xmath14 of semigroups and homomorphisms to the category @xmath15 of banach algebras and contractive algebra homomorphisms .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the class of algebras @xmath4 contains more familiar classes of banach algebras as special cases :    * if @xmath2 is a group then @xmath4 is just the usual @xmath0-group algebra ; * if @xmath16 with the usual additive operations , then @xmath17 may be identified with the @xmath0-completion of the polynomial ring @xmath18 $ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we also remark that our semigroups need not have identity elements : a semigroup with an identity element is called a .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is concerned with a special class of commutative semigroups , basic in semigroup theory but perhaps less familiar in the context of functional analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath2 be a semigroup . </S>",
    "<S> an element @xmath19 of @xmath2 is if @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> a commutative semigroup @xmath2 in which every element is idempotent is called a ; if @xmath2 has an identity element then we shall say that @xmath2 is a .    </S>",
    "<S> [ eg : finfree ] let @xmath21 be any set and consider the power set @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the binary map @xmath23 given by @xmath24 is associative , and one may therefore regard @xmath22 as a semigroup with product given by @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly this semigroup is commutative , has a unit ( namely the empty set @xmath26 ) and consists of idempotents , and thus @xmath22 is a unital semilattice  in fact , it is the on the generating set @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> define @xmath27 by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath29 defines an associative binary product , and the semigroup @xmath30 turns out to be a non - unital semilattice . </S>",
    "<S> ( more generally , any totally ordered set @xmath31 is a semilattice when equipped with the multiplication @xmath32 . )    </S>",
    "<S> every commutative semigroup @xmath2 admits a decomposition @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the set of idempotents in @xmath2 and @xmath35 ( see , for example , @xcite , ch . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , exercise 3 . ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the possibility of relating homological properties of @xmath4 to those of each subalgebra @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> one possible first step is to understand as much as possible about the case where each @xmath37 consists of a single element , i.e. when @xmath38 is a semilattice ; the present paper is an attempt to make progress in this direction .      in performing our main calculations we shall need to deal with projective tensor powers of @xmath4 ( see @xcite , ch . 2 for a full discussion of the of banach spaces ) . </S>",
    "<S> throughout this paper the projective tensor product of two banach spaces @xmath39 and @xmath40 is denoted by @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> potential difficulties with the projective tensor product can be sidestepped in what follows , because the underlying banach space of @xmath4 is @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> let us therefore recall some trivial but useful observations about @xmath0-spaces .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath21 and @xmath42 are two sets then it is well known that there is an isometric linear isomorphism @xmath43 : see e.g. @xcite , example 2.6 . moreover , if @xmath39 is a banach space then every bounded linear map @xmath44 restricts to a bounded function @xmath45 , where elements of @xmath21 are identified with the corresponding basis vectors in @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , any bounded function @xmath45 extends uniquely to a bounded linear function @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if @xmath48 are sets , every bounded function from @xmath49 to @xmath39 extends uniquely to a bounded linear map from @xmath50 to @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> these observations motivate the following definition , which is not standard but provides useful shorthand notation . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath51 denote the element of @xmath46 which takes the value 1 on @xmath52 and is 0 everywhere else .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath48 be sets . </S>",
    "<S> a in @xmath53 is an elementary tensor of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 for @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall often abuse notation by identifying a primitive tensor in @xmath57 with an @xmath6-tuple of elements of @xmath21 , and shall denote both by a bold letter : thus if @xmath58 , we shall identify @xmath59 with @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> since the linear span of @xmath61 is dense in @xmath46 , the set of primitive tensors in @xmath53 spans a dense linear subspace .    </S>",
    "<S> hochschild cohomology in this section we recall some basic facts about the ( continuous ) hochschild cohomology of banach algebras ( see @xcite or @xcite for more details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath10 be a banach algebra and @xmath7 a banach @xmath10-bimodule . </S>",
    "<S> for each @xmath62 let @xmath63 elements of @xmath64 [ resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 are called [ resp . ] on @xmath10 with coefficients in @xmath7 .    the banach spaces @xmath64 and @xmath66 fit into chain and cochain complexes , respectively , as follows :    @xmath67    @xmath68    where the @xmath69 is defined by @xmath70 and the @xmath71 is defined by @xmath72 the @xmath6th homology group of the chain complex is , by defintion , the quotient vector space @xmath73 and the @xmath6th cohomology group of the cochain complex is @xmath74 we refer to the vector spaces @xmath75 and @xmath76 as the and groups , respectively , of @xmath10 with coefficients in @xmath7 .    of particular interest are the cases where the bimodule @xmath7 is either @xmath10 itself ( with the bimodule action given by left and right multiplication in @xmath10 ) or @xmath77 ( with the canonically induced dual action ) . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to the spaces @xmath78 as the of @xmath10 and to @xmath79 as the of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also use the notation @xmath80 and @xmath81 as abbreviations for the simplicial homology and cohomology groups respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> reduction to simplicial homology under certain conditions , the simplicial homology of a commutative banach algebra gives us information on hochschild cohomology with symmetric coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the precise statement requires us to consider the of banach @xmath10-modules : a full acount can be found in @xcite ,  </S>",
    "<S> ii.3 but we shall briefly summarise the required facts below .    if @xmath21 is a right banach @xmath10-module and @xmath42 a left banach @xmath10-module , the banach space @xmath82 is defined to be the quotient of @xmath83 by the closed linear span of the set @xmath84 and if @xmath85 is a left banach @xmath10-module , the banach space @xmath86 is defined to be the space of all bounded , @xmath10-module maps from @xmath42 to @xmath85 , equipped with the usual operator norm .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important for the ensuing argument that both @xmath87 and @xmath88 define additive functors from the category of left banach @xmath10-modules to the category of banach spaces : in particular , if @xmath89 is a _ split exact _ </S>",
    "<S> complex of left banach @xmath10-modules and @xmath10-module maps , then the induced complexes @xmath90 and @xmath91 of banach spaces are both split exact .    </S>",
    "<S> [ l : basechange ] suppose @xmath10 is a commutative banach algebra , and regard each banach space @xmath92 as a left banach @xmath10-module via @xmath93 then for each @xmath62 the hochschild boundary map @xmath94 is a map of left banach @xmath10-modules .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover : if @xmath10 is also unital , and @xmath7 is a symmetric , unit - linked @xmath10-bimodule , there are isometric isomorphisms of chain complexes of banach spaces @xmath95 and @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the right and left @xmath10-modules obtained from @xmath7 by restricting the action to one side .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof that @xmath94 is an @xmath10-module map is a routine calculation ( it is crucial here that @xmath10 is commutative ) . the statement about isomorphism of chain complexes is a simple extension of the following observation : when @xmath10 is unital and @xmath7 is symmetric , then for any banach space @xmath39 there are isometric isomorphisms of banach spaces @xmath99    next we state the main result of this section , for which the author knows no exact reference in the literature , but which is probably not a new observation .    </S>",
    "<S> [ p : uct ] let @xmath10 be a unital , commutative banach algebra that is isomorphic as a banach space to @xmath100 for some indexing set @xmath101 . the following are equivalent :    * @xmath102 for all @xmath103 ; * @xmath104 for all @xmath103 ; * the complex of left banach @xmath10-modules @xmath105 splits in the category of banach spaces and bounded linear maps ; * the complex of left @xmath10-modules @xmath105 splits in the category of left banach @xmath10-modules ; * @xmath106 for all @xmath103 and any _ symmetric , unit - linked _ @xmath10-bimodule @xmath7 ; * @xmath107 for all @xmath103 and any _ symmetric , unit - linked _ </S>",

    "<S> clearly @xmath108 and @xmath109 </S>",
    "<S> . we shall show that @xmath110 which will prove the theorem .    : </S>",
    "<S> the hochschild cochain complex @xmath111 is the dual of the hochschild chain complex @xmath112 that is , @xmath113 for all @xmath6 . since @xmath10 is commutative , @xmath114 and @xmath115 . hence ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> is equivalent to exactness of the complex    @xmath116    while ( b ) is equivalent to exactness of the complex @xmath117    since is the dual of , exactness of one of the complexes implies exactness of the other by astandard duality argument ( see @xcite corollary 1.3 , or @xcite proposition ii.5.29 ) .    : </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that @xmath118 holds if and only if the chain complex @xmath105 is exact . </S>",
    "<S> recall that @xmath119 for each @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath120 is surjective , the well - known lifting property of @xmath121 with respect to open mappings allows us to find a bounded linear map @xmath122 such that @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath124 is a bounded linear projection of @xmath125 onto @xmath126 .    </S>",
    "<S> using the lifting property of @xmath127 with respect to the surjection @xmath128 , we can lift the map @xmath129 to a bounded linear map @xmath130 : by construction , @xmath131 .    continuing in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we inductively construct bounded linear maps @xmath132 for each @xmath103 , such that @xmath133 for all @xmath6 .    : condition @xmath134 states that the complex of banach @xmath10-modules @xmath105 splits in the category of banach spaces and bounded linear maps . but for each @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath135 is projective ( @xcite , defn iii.1.13 ) as a left banach @xmath10-module , since @xmath10 is _ unital_. therefore , if @xmath134 holds , the projectivity of each @xmath136 may be used to inductively construct continuous @xmath10-module maps @xmath137 , @xmath103 , such that @xmath138 for all @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the argument is essentially the same as that used to prove that @xmath139 .    : by lemma [ l : basechange ] , for each @xmath6 we have @xmath140 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the right and left @xmath10-modules obtained from @xmath7 by restricting the action to one side . now </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath141 holds then the banach space complexes @xmath142 and @xmath143 are both ( split ) exact in degrees @xmath1 , and so @xmath144 and @xmath145 must hold .    before going on to apply this result </S>",
    "<S> , we make some remarks to put it in context : these are not required for the main result of this paper , but may serve as motivation for proposition [ p : uct ] .    </S>",
    "<S> specifically , proposition [ p : uct ] is modelled on a special case of the following result for `` purely algebraic '' hochschild cohomology ( see @xcite , ch . 9 for the necessary definitions ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath146 be a commutative ring , and let @xmath147 be a commutative unital @xmath146-algebra _ which is @xmath146-projective_. then for any unit - linked , symmetric @xmath147-bimodule @xmath21 , there is a spectral sequence @xmath148    although we can not find an exact reference for , it follows easily from the isomorphisms @xmath149 , @xmath150 ( @xcite , corollary 9.1.5 ) and a change - of - rings spectral sequence for @xmath151 ( see , for example , @xcite theorem 11.6.5 ) .    in particular , if @xmath152 for all @xmath153 , the spectral sequence collapses to give @xmath154 where the last equality holds because @xmath155 is @xmath147-projective .    </S>",
    "<S> the point is that equation is the algebraic analogue of the implication @xmath156 of proposition [ p : uct ] . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that the use of proposition [ p : uct ] in this paper may lead to further work in finding effective , banach algebraic analogues of the change - of - rings spectral sequences .    </S>",
    "<S> statement of main theorem and initial reductions[s : state_thm ]    a banach algebra @xmath10 is if @xmath102 for all @xmath103 .    </S>",
    "<S> since a banach algebra @xmath10 is amenable if and only if @xmath157 for all @xmath10-bimodules @xmath21 and all @xmath103 ( @xcite  44 proposition 6 ) , every amenable banach algebra is simplicially trivial . </S>",
    "<S> however , simplicial triviality is in general much weaker than amenability . </S>",
    "<S> it was observed at the start that if @xmath2 is an infinite semilattice then by @xcite , theorem 10 , @xmath4 can not be amenable . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast we present the following theorem , which is the main result of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> [ t : result ] let @xmath2 be a unital semilattice . then @xmath4 is simplicially trivial .    </S>",
    "<S> [ c : symm_hoch ] let @xmath2 be a semilattice . </S>",
    "<S> then the hochschild cohomology groups @xmath5 are zero for all @xmath158 and all symmetric @xmath4-bimodules @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use proposition [ p : uct ] , together with some cohomological machinery to get round the problem that @xmath4 might not be unital .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath10 is any banach algebra , with forced unitisation denoted by @xmath159 , then each banach @xmath10-bimodule @xmath21 may be regarded as a unit - linked , banach @xmath159-bimodule @xmath160 , where the action of @xmath159 on @xmath160 is given by @xmath161 there is then a canonical restriction map @xmath162 which induces an isomorphism of cohomology groups for each @xmath6 ( @xcite , exercise iii.4.10 ; see also @xcite , ch . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) .    in particular , @xmath163 for all @xmath6 . now since @xmath164 , </S>",
    "<S> theorem [ t : result ] implies that @xmath165 is simplicially trivial . invoking proposition [ p : uct ] </S>",
    "<S> we deduce that @xmath166 for all @xmath158 , and this completes the proof .    </S>",
    "<S> theorem [ t : result ] will be deduced from a stronger statement ( theorem [ t : mainthm ] below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proof requires some preliminaries , which are given in the next two sections .    a contracting homotopy for the unital , finite free case[s : finite_free ] in this section , fix a finite set @xmath21 and let @xmath167 be the free unital semilattice generated by @xmath21 , as defined in example [ eg : finfree ] . for notational convenience </S>",
    "<S> we write @xmath168 rather than @xmath169 for the element of @xmath170 that takes the value 1 on the element @xmath171 and is 0 everwhere else : note that by the way multiplication in @xmath40 and @xmath172 is defined , @xmath173    [ l : fin_free_split ] there exist linear maps @xmath174 , @xmath62 , such that @xmath175 for all @xmath103 .    we emphasise that for our application to the proof of theorem [ t : result ] , </S>",
    "<S> explicit formulas for the maps @xmath176 are not required . </S>",
    "<S> however finding explicit @xmath176 is straightforward and so we give a sharper form of lemma [ l : fin_free_split ] below . to do this </S>",
    "<S> we introduce distinguished elements of the algebra @xmath172 : for every @xmath177 let @xmath178    [ l : fin_free_explicit ] for @xmath103 define @xmath179 by @xmath180 and let @xmath181 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath182 for all @xmath103 , and @xmath183 for all @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> the required properties of @xmath184 are collected in the following lemma .    </S>",

    "<S> :    * @xmath186 ; * @xmath187 for all @xmath188 . * @xmath189 ;    the norm estimate @xmath190 is trivial .    </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath40 is commutative , for each @xmath191 a direct computation yields @xmath192 it follows immediately that @xmath193 for all @xmath194 , and since the @xmath168 span @xmath172 as a vector space we deduce by linearity that @xmath195 . </S>",
    "<S> thus ( ii ) is proved .    finally : since @xmath40 is commutative @xmath184 is the product of commuting idempotents and is therefore itself an idempotent . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath196 and ( iii ) is proved .    </S>",
    "<S> those familiar with hochschild cohomology will recognise that we are exploiting the existence of a `` diagonal for the algebra @xmath172 '' . to put this in context : whenever @xmath10 is an algebra with a diagonal @xmath197 and @xmath7 is an @xmath10-bimodule , standard techniques from homological algebra can be applied to construct from @xmath197 an explicit contracting homotopy of the chain complex @xmath198 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to appeal to known results one must first prove that @xmath172 has a diagonal , and such a proof is not significantly shorter than the direct approach taken here .    the proof that @xmath199 is a direct computation using properties ( ii ) and ( iii ) in lemma [ l : diagonal ] . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate on @xmath200 follows from the inequalities @xmath201 and @xmath202 where the last estimate uses the bound established in lemma [ l : diagonal ] ( i ) .    for fixed @xmath6 , the splitting map @xmath176 that is given in lemma [ l : fin_free_explicit ] clearly depends on the underlying set @xmath21 which generates @xmath40 , and there is no reason to believe that there is a uniform bound on the norm of @xmath176 as the size of @xmath21 increases . </S>",
    "<S> ( in fact , there can be no such bound : if there were , a straightforward exhaustion argument would allow one to construct a bounded approximate diagonal for @xmath203 , giving a contradiction since by @xcite @xmath203 is not amenable . ) nevertheless , in section [ s : mainthm ] we shall use the maps @xmath176 to inductively construct _ natural _ splitting maps , and it is these natural maps which split the simplicial chain complex of any @xmath0 semilattice algebra .    here the word  </S>",
    "<S> natural \" must be made precise , in terms of functors between categories . </S>",
    "<S> this will be done in the next section .    </S>",
    "<S> natural transformations and formal substitution[s : formalsub ] we shall only need the basic language of category theory , for which a standard reference is @xcite .    the categories @xmath14 and @xmath15 have already been introduced . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also need to consider the following :    * @xmath204  the category of monoids and monoid homomorphisms ; * @xmath205  the full subcategory of @xmath204 whose objects are unital semilattices ; * @xmath206  the category of banach algebras and continuous algebra homomorphisms ; * @xmath207  the category of banach spaces and continuous linear maps .    </S>",
    "<S> [ l : hoch_is_nat ] for any @xmath62 , @xmath208 defines a functor from @xmath206 to @xmath207 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the hochschild boundary map @xmath209 defines a natural transformation between functors .    </S>",
    "<S> the first part is immediate once one recalls that the underlying banach space of @xmath136 is @xmath210 , and that for each @xmath211 taking the @xmath211th projective tensor power is a functorial operation on banach spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the second part is an easy calculation , which depends on the fact that each face map @xmath212 is natural in @xmath213 .    if @xmath214 in @xmath15 we shall write @xmath215 rather than @xmath216 . we shall abuse notation further by writing @xmath217 for @xmath218 whenever @xmath219 is a semilattice . </S>",
    "<S> then for each @xmath6 , @xmath220 may be considered as a functor from @xmath205 to @xmath207  more precisely , as the composite of the functors @xmath221    important convention . </S>",
    "<S> henceforth , whenever we refer to one of the functors @xmath220 we shall always mean that it is a functor from @xmath205 to @xmath207 .    </S>",
