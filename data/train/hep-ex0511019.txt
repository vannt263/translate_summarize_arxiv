    "heavy quarkonia , either @xmath10 or @xmath11 , have provided good laboratories for the study of the strong interaction .",
    "new , large data samples at cleo / cesr and bes / bepc have renewed the interest in heavy quarkonia@xcite .",
    "although copiously produced in electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions from the @xmath2 and @xmath12 , the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath0 ( @xmath15 ) are largely unexplored .",
    "the dominant hadronic transitions among the heavy quarkonia involve di - pion emission , characterized by yan@xcite as the emission of two soft gluons which then hadronize as a di - pion system .",
    "these have been studied for transitions among the quarkonia @xmath16 states , but have not been observed in other quarkonia transitions such as @xmath17 or the @xmath13 decays , which are the subject of this work .",
    "new interest in @xmath13 decays has also been generated by the cleo observation@xcite of a large branching fraction for the decay @xmath18 .",
    "this is the only presently known hadronic decay of the @xmath19-wave @xmath20 states and the only hadronic bottomonium transition that is not through @xmath21 .",
    "we have investigated another hadronic transition of the @xmath13 , namely @xmath22 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal_and_ts ] , this search starts with the e1 transition @xmath23 , followed by the signal process @xmath22 , and the resulting @xmath0 decay ( again via an e1 transition ) as @xmath24 with @xmath5 .",
    "thus the final state has two photons , two low - momentum ( `` soft '' ) pions and two high - momentum leptons . in this article",
    "we ( i ) establish this @xmath13 decay and , with reasonable assumptions , ( ii ) estimate the partial width @xmath25(2p)@xmath1(1p)@xmath26 .    the main background to our signal , also shown in fig .  [ fig : signal_and_ts ] , has @xmath27 , followed by an e1 cascade through the @xmath0 states to the @xmath28 .",
    "this background process , which we will denote as `` @xmath29 '' , has the same number of pions , leptons and photons , with similar kinematics .",
    "while this means we need stringent selection criteria to define the signal , it also provides a known process with a nearly identical final state against which to test our analysis procedures .",
    "the data were collected at the cornell electron storage ring using the cleo iii@xcite detector configuration .",
    "the components most critical for this analysis were the cs - i electromagnetic calorimeter and the charged particle tracking system , each covering @xmath3093% of the @xmath31 solid angle .",
    "consisting of 7800 crystals , the calorimeter was originally installed in the cleo  ii configuration@xcite , with some reshaping and restacking for cleo  iii to allow more complete solid angle coverage .",
    "the shower energy resolution , @xmath32 , is 4% at 100 mev and 2% at 1 gev in the barrel region , defined as @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the dip angle with respect to the beam axis .",
    "complemented at small radius by a 4-layer double - sided silicon vertex detector , a new drift chamber@xcite was installed for cleo iii ; its endplate design minimizes material , enhancing the resolution of the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter , extending the solid angle coverage to @xmath35 .",
    "the signal was searched for in 1.39 fb@xmath36 of data accumulated at the center of mass energy corresponding to the @xmath2 resonance , consisting of @xmath37 resonance decays@xcite .",
    "we also used 8.6 fb@xmath36 of data taken at @xmath38 gev ( `` high - energy continuum '' ) and 0.78 fb@xmath36 of data taken at the @xmath12 , or roughly @xmath39 decays@xcite , to study and evaluate backgrounds .",
    "we used large monte carlo simulations based on geant3.211/11@xcite to estimate our efficiencies and tune our selection criteria .",
    "in addition to the signal process , we simulated : ( i ) the main background process , `` @xmath29 '' , as described above and in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal_and_ts ] ; ( ii ) @xmath27 with @xmath40 , a process with higher statistics and similar pion kinematics , to help confirm our efficiency determinations ; ( iii ) @xmath27 with @xmath41 , which could mimic our signal multiplicity if two photons were missed ; ( iv ) `` generic '' @xmath2 monte carlo , which uses all known properties and modes of @xmath2 decay , but for which the backgrounds ( i ) through ( iii ) are tagged and not analyzed ; ( v ) @xmath42 continuum processes at the @xmath2 center of mass energy ; ( vii ) for the charged pion decay channel , @xmath43 with @xmath18 and @xmath44 , which has the same initial photon transition as our signal but would have an additional photon in the decay of the @xmath45 resulting from the @xmath46 decay to @xmath47 ; and ( viii ) for the neutral pion decay channel , @xmath48 with @xmath49 ; we used @xmath50 , which is the present 90% cl upper limit for this decay .    in our studies we assumed that there were no @xmath51-wave contributions to the decays , only @xmath52-wave , so that @xmath53 .",
    "this assumption is supported by : ( a ) the maximum available energy , @xmath54 , for the nine possible decays is @xmath55 = 130 mev , making it difficult to have the extra kinetic energy associated with two units of angular momentum ; ( b ) previous studies of @xmath2@xmath56@xcite and @xmath57@xcite , systems with substantially more @xmath54 , indicate no angular momentum between the final state onium and the dipion system , although the former result is also consistent@xcite with a few percent of @xmath51-wave ; and ( c ) , the average ( weighted by the observed distribution of di - pion invariant mass , @xmath58 ) of the @xmath51-wave between the two pions in @xmath59@xcite is less than 10% .    as shown in table  [ tab : allowed ] , the entry and exit branching fractions@xcite strongly disfavor our observation of @xmath60 .",
    "we also had to discriminate against this possible mode in order to suppress our dominant background source , `` @xmath29 '' , in that there is overlap in the energies of the e1 transition photon for the @xmath60 signal process and that of the dominant @xmath61 mode of that background .",
    "therefore , we assumed that the transitions with @xmath62 or @xmath63 dominate . to estimate the relative abundance of these two transitions and , later , to calculate the partial width @xmath64 , we needed the _ full _ widths @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we calculated these using the theoretical e1 partial widths for these two states@xcite and their experimental e1 branching fractions@xcite to @xmath67(1s ) and @xmath67(2s ) , where in the latter we took into account the new cleo iii value@xcite of @xmath68 .",
    "our results , also listed in table  [ tab : allowed ] , are @xmath69 kev and @xmath70 kev . given @xmath71 from this table we expected the @xmath62 transition to dominate @xmath72 by roughly a factor of 2.3 .",
    ".the three di - pion transitions between @xmath73 and @xmath0 that leave the orbital angular momentum unchanged ( @xmath52-wave ) .",
    "the third column is the mass difference .",
    "columns four and five are the branching fractions for the entrance and exit e1 transitions : @xmath74(3s)@xmath75 and @xmath76(1s ) ) .",
    "the e1 transition from @xmath77 is unobserved , with a limit of 6% on its branching fraction at 90% c.l .. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the individual contributions to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : defining ] are shown in table  [ tab : contributions ] , along with the value of @xmath64 obtained , its statistical uncertainty , and its individual ( cleo - based ) systematic uncertainty . taking the _ statistical _ average of the three gives @xmath78 } = ( 0.84 \\pm 0.22)$ ] kev .",
    "a more complete average takes into account the individual systematic uncertainties ; this weighted average is @xmath79 kev . following the pdg@xcite prescription for evaluating the consistency of results",
    "being averaged , we obtain an uncertainty scale factor of 1.09 , which is close to unity .",
    "de - convolving the statistical uncertainty and adding in a separate term for the 22% `` common '' uncertainties that are not based on measurements in this analysis yields our final result of @xmath80 with the uncertainties being statistical , systematics from our analyses , and systematics from outside sources .",
    "this result for @xmath22 can be compared to values derived from the pdg@xcite of @xmath81 ) kev for a process with somewhat less @xmath54 and @xmath82 kev for a process with considerably more @xmath54 .",
    "our result is consistent with the theoretical expectations of kuang and yan@xcite , who have calculated @xmath83 kev . in summary , we have searched the cleo iii data at the @xmath2 resonance for the decay @xmath22 using four different approaches .",
    "the combined probability that the signal process is absent is small , leading to the conclusion that the null hypothesis can not be substantiated . under the assumption of no @xmath51-wave contributions",
    "we obtain a partial width for each of the @xmath62 and @xmath72 transitions of @xmath84 .",
