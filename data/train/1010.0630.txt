    "network coding is an exciting new technique promising to improve the limits of transferring information in wireless networks .",
    "the basic idea is to combine packets that travel along similar paths in order to achieve the multicast capacity of networks .",
    "the network coding scheme called _ local network coding _ was one of the first practical implementations able to showcase throughput benefits , see cope in @xcite .",
    "the idea of local network coding is to encode packets belonging to different flows whenever it is possible for these packets to be decoded at the next hop .",
    "the simplicity of the idea gave hopes for its efficient application in a real - world wireless router .",
    "in the simple alice - relay - bob scenario , the relay xors outgoing packets while alice and bob use their own packets as keys for decoding . the whole procedure offers a throughput improvement of 4/3 by eliminating one unnecessary transmission .",
    "local network coding has been enhanced with the functionality of",
    "_ opportunistic listen_. the wireless terminals are exposed to information traversing the channel , and @xcite proposed a smart way to make the best of this inherent broadcast property of the wireless channel .",
    "particularly , each terminal operates in always - on mode , overhearing constantly the channel and storing all overheard packets .",
    "the reception of these packets is explicitly announced to an intermediate node , called the relay , which makes the encoding decisions .",
    "finally , the relay can arbitrarily combine packets of different flows as long as the recipients have the necessary keys for decoding .",
    "using the idea of opportunistic listen , an infinite wheel topology , where everyone listens to everyone except from the intended receiver , can benefit by an order of 2 in aggregate throughput by diminishing the downlink into a single transmission , see @xcite .",
    "the wheel is a particular symmetric topology that is expected to appear rarely in real settings .",
    "also , the above calculations take into account that all links have the same transmission rates , thus it takes the same amount of time to deliver a native ( non - coded ) packet or an encoded one .",
    "in addition , all possible flows are conveniently assumed to exist .",
    "this , however , is not expected to be a frequent setting in a real world network .",
    "a natural question reads : what is the expected throughput gain in an arbitrary wireless ad hoc network ?",
    "the maximum gain does not come at no cost either .",
    "deciding which packets to group together in an encoded packet is not a trivial matter as explained in @xcite , in er @xcite and in clone @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the medium is assumed to be lossy , and the goal is to find the optimal pattern of retransmissions in order to maximize throughput .",
    "in the first case , a queue - length based algorithm is proposed for end - to - end encoding of symmetric flows ( i.e. flows that one s sender is the other s destination and the other way around . ) .",
    "all these decision - making problems are formulated as follows .",
    "denote @xmath2 the set of nodes in need of a packet belonging to flow @xmath3 and @xmath4 the set of nodes having it .",
    "then the encoded combination of two packets belonging to flows @xmath3 and @xmath5 can be decoded successfully if and only if @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "if this condition is true we draw an edge on the _ coding graph _ with vertices all the possible packets . then finding the optimal encoding scheme",
    "is reduced to finding a minimum clique partition of the coding graph , a commonly known np - hard problem , @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the same complexity appears when the relay node makes scheduling decisions , i.e. , selecting which packets to serve and with what combinations .",
    "work related to index coding has shown that this problem can be reduced to the boolean satifyability problem ( sat problem ) , @xcite .",
    "thus a second question arises : what is the loss in throughput gain if instead of searching over all possible encoded packet combinations , we restrict our search in combinations of size at most @xmath8 ? in this paper we are interested in showing that , for a real ad hoc wireless network , opportunities for large encoding combinations rarely appear . to show this",
    ", we consider regular topologies like grids as well as random ones . we calculate the maximum encoding number in these scenarios in the mean sense and we consider small as well as large networks . to capture the behaviour of large ( or dense ) networks ,",
    "we examine the scaling laws of maximum encoding number .",
    "scaling laws are of extreme interest for the network community in general .",
    "although they hold asymptotically , they provide valuable insights to the system designers . in this direction , the authors in @xcite study the wireless networks scaling capacity in a gupta - kumar way taking into account complex field nc .",
    "@xcite also examines the use of nc for scaling capacity of wireless networks .",
    "they find that nc can not improve the order of throughput , i.e. the @xmath9 law prevails .",
    "@xcite discusses the issue of scaling nc gain in terms of delays while @xcite identifies the energy benefits of nc both for single multicast session as well as for multiple unicast sessions . in @xcite ,",
    "nc is used instead of power control and the benefits are characterized . in a similar spirit , @xcite investigates the use of rate adaptation for wireless networks with intersession nc .",
    "utilizing rate adaptation , it is possible to change the connectivity and increase or decrease the number of neighbors per node .",
    "they identify domains of throughput benefits for such case .",
    "the most relevant work in the field is @xcite .",
    "the authors analyze the maximum coding number , i.e. , the maximum number of packets that can be encoded together such that the corresponding receivers are able to decode .",
    "they show that this number scales with the ratio @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a region outside the communication region and inside the interference region .",
    "note however , that this work does not yield any geometric property for the frequency of large combinations since it relies only on specific protocol characteristics . in networks with small @xmath11 , e.g. , whenever a hard decoding rule is applied , there is no bound for the maximum coding number .    in this paper",
    "we study the problem from a totally different point of view , showing that there exist inherent geometric properties bounding the maximum coding number below a number relative to the population or density of nodes .",
    "moreover , we apply the boolean connectivity model for which @xmath12 , and thus the previous result does not provide any bound at all .",
    "we show that the upper bound of the maximum coding number is related to a convexity property that any valid combination has .",
    "we start by considering a fixed separation distance network , like a square grid , and show that in such networks , the maximum coding number is @xmath13 and @xmath14{n})$ ] , denotes that the function is bounded above by some linear function of the expression in the brackets whereas @xmath15 denotes that the expression is bounded from below . ] where @xmath1 is the number of nodes in transmission range of the relay .",
    "this implies that , even in networks with canonically placed nodes , the maximum coding combination is line - shaped even though the set of all nodes live in 2-dimensions .",
    "next we study a random network where the locations of the nodes follow a poisson point process on the plane . in this case , the maximum encoding number is found to be bounded in probability by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the node density and @xmath18 arbitrary .",
    "finally we consider the case where the encoder searches for combinations of at most size @xmath19 .",
    "we show that the throughput efficiency loss in this case depends on the size of the network , and for small networks the loss can be negligible .",
    "this way we motivate heuristic algorithms that avoid the high complexity arising in encoding selection .",
    "through extensive simulations we show that all the derived results hold in general even for small networks .",
    "is selected inside the disk of radius @xmath20 and origin the location of @xmath21.,width=240 ]    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , the model is described and some basic properties are given . in section [ sec : deterministic ] , the main results for the case of grid - like networks are derived . then in section [ sec : stochastic ] the case of randomly positioned networks is considered .",
    "a rate analysis is provided in section [ sec : efficiency ] and simulation results are shown in section [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we assume a set of nodes @xmath22 , positioned on the plane .",
    "communications between these nodes are established via the boolean interference model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this model , a link between two nodes @xmath23 is realized if and only if @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", we say that @xmath25 is connected with @xmath26 and vice versa .",
    "note that the boolean interference model is an undirected graph in the sense that only bi - directional links appear .",
    "each node @xmath25 having degree @xmath27 , apart from transmitting and receiving , relays information . in this process , it is possible to avoid unnecessary transmissions by employing local network coding . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we will consider only one cell , i.e. , we will focus on a given node @xmath21 , and all its neighbors , and calculate the network coding gain on the downlink of this node .",
    "a similar result , then , holds for any such node serving as a relay .",
    "thus we restrict @xmath22 to contain all neighbors of @xmath21 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the number of nodes under consideration . for a network determined by a poisson point process with density @xmath17 ,",
    "we use correspondingly the mean number of points which is given by @xmath30}=\\lambda \\pi r^2 $ ] .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to find how the _ maximum coding number _ and the _ maximum network coding gain _ scale with the number of nodes .",
    "also we will provide bounds for the scaling constants which are useful for determining the behaviour in small networks .",
    "apart from the number of neighbors , the gain analysis depends also on the activated flows . in the simple alice  relay ",
    "bob topology , it is possible that only the flow going from alice to bob is activated , in which case the gain is zero . in this paper",
    "we are interested in determining an upper bound for the efficiency loss when the relay is constrained on combinations of size @xmath19 ( e.g. if @xmath31 the system is constrained to pairwise xoring ) .",
    "for this reason , we consider the maximum gain scenario . for each node designated as a relay",
    ", we assume that all possible two  hop flows traversing this relay are activated .",
    "this means that each node designated as a relay , has all possible different packets from which to select an xor combination to send to the neighbors . since not all of those combinations are valid , finding the maximum valid combination that corresponds to the maximum coding number is a non - trivial task and will be the goal of this paper .",
    "the resulting bound will help characterize the efficiency loss due to resorting to @xmath8-wise encoding . in real systems",
    ", some flows might not be active in which case the resulting efficiency loss from @xmath8-wise encoding will be even smaller .    to make this more precise , similar to @xcite",
    ", we define source - destination pairs designating 2hop flows that cross the relay .",
    "each flow @xmath32 has a source @xmath33 , a destination @xmath34 , a set of nodes having it @xmath35 ( either by overhearing or ownership ) and a set of nodes needing it @xmath36 .",
    "we write @xmath37 because at least one node , the destination @xmath34 or the source @xmath33 , is not part of @xmath38 and @xmath39 correspondingly .",
    "two flows @xmath40 are called symmetric when they satisfy the property @xmath41 and @xmath42 .      here",
    "we summarize the previous subsection in the form of constraints .",
    "we will focus on network coding opportunities appearing in the aforementioned arbitrary network around the relay @xmath21 .    _",
    "( valid node ) : _ a node @xmath43 is a _ valid node _ if @xmath44 .    _",
    "( valid flow ) : _ a flow @xmath45 is a _ valid flow _ if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are valid nodes not neighboring with each other , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "_ ( valid combination ) : _ a subet of flows @xmath47 with @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , is a _ valid combination",
    "_ if    * each flow @xmath50 is a valid flow , * every pair of flows @xmath51 satisfies @xmath6 and @xmath52 or equivalently , @xmath53 is connected with @xmath54 while @xmath55 is connected with @xmath56 .",
    "we define the maximum coding number @xmath57 as the greatest cardinality among all valid sets @xmath58 .",
    "if the positions of the network are random , @xmath57 is evidently a random variable .",
    "note that we could impose additional constraints .",
    "for example , if a flow can be routed more efficiently by a node other than @xmath21 , then this flow should be excluded from the set of valid flows .",
    "this would restrict further the set of valid combinations and thus by omitting this constraint we derive an upper bound for @xmath57 .",
    "next , we state some fundamental properties of the valid combinations . for each flow",
    "@xmath59 belonging to a valid combination @xmath58 we have    * @xmath60 , * @xmath61 for all @xmath62 ,    which leads us to the following properties .",
    "the destination node of @xmath63 is different from the destination node of any other flow @xmath64 .",
    "the source node of @xmath63 is different from the source node of any other flow @xmath65 .",
    "next , we provide a result on the topology for a valid combination .",
    "let @xmath66 represent the set of locations of all nodes being the source or destination of a flow belonging to a combination @xmath58 .",
    "any valid combination of size 3 or larger corresponds to a convex polygon ( the polygon is formed using the set @xmath66 as edges ) .",
    "[ lemma : convex ]    consider a valid combination defined by flows @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "consider also the set of nodes that are sources and/or destinations in @xmath58 @xmath69 and the induced set of locations @xmath66 such that we have a bijective mapping for each element @xmath70 with an element @xmath71 .",
    "assume that there is a node @xmath72 which is an interior point of the convex hull is the minimal convex set containing @xmath73 . ] of @xmath66 .",
    "thus its location @xmath74 can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .",
    "on the other hand , there is a unique @xmath79 , which is the communicating pair ( source or destination ) of @xmath26 in at least one flow , so that @xmath80    all the other nodes ( destinations or sources ) in @xmath81 should be able to reach the node @xmath82 directly .",
    "thus , @xmath83 which is a contradiction to ( [ eq : proximity ] ) .",
    "consequently the node @xmath26 , as well as all other nodes of the combination , necessarily lie on the perimeter of the convex hull .",
    "thus , the nodes of a valid combination are the vertices of a convex polygon .    when the set of sources is identical to the set of destinations , the combination consists of symmetric flows only and @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "in order to calculate an upper bound of the network coding combination size , it is enough to resort to the case of symmetric flows .    for any valid combination there",
    "exists at least one combination of the same or larger size that contains only symmetric flows .",
    "we will show that for any flow we can add the symmetric one without invalidating the combination as long as it is not already counted .    in a bipartite graph with all the nodes @xmath22 on one side and the destinations of @xmath58 on the other , consider a directional link @xmath86 , between the source of flow @xmath59 and its destination , for each @xmath87 .",
    "note now that the nodes having out - degree one , i.e. , the active sources in @xmath58 , may or may not be identical to one of the destination nodes .",
    "we can make a partition of the set of active sources by assigning those with the above property to the set @xmath88 and the rest to the complementary set @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath90 , then the lemma is proved since @xmath58 is a valid combination with symmetric flows only . if not , then we can create a new combination @xmath91 which has more flows than the original one using the following process . for each transmitter in @xmath89 , say @xmath53 the transmitter of flow @xmath3 , add one extra flow @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this flow does not belong to @xmath58 ( because @xmath95 ) and it does not invalidate the combination due to the bidirectional properties of the model . note",
    "that @xmath92 is a valid flow because @xmath96 can not be connected to @xmath97 due to validity of @xmath3 .",
    "note also that @xmath96 is connected to @xmath34 for all @xmath98 since this is again required for the decoding of the original flows .",
    "thus , for any flow we can add the symmetric one without invalidating the combination .",
    "if a valid combination consists of symmetric flows only , its size must be even .    in graph theory terms",
    ", a valid combination with symmetric flows can be thought of as a graph created by a clique of @xmath99 nodes , minus a matching with @xmath100 edges , with all symmetric flows defined by this matching activated .",

    "in this section we focus on positioning the nodes on a grid .",
    "grid topologies often offer an insightful first step approach towards the random positioning behaviour . also , the investigation of grids answers the question whether it is possible to achieve high nc gain by arranging the locations of the nodes .",
    "we therefore assume a network with the additional property @xmath101 , for any pair of nodes @xmath102 .",
    "this condition pertains to regular grids such as the square , the triangular and the hexagonal grid as well as other grids with non - uniform geometry .",

    "any such polygon fitting inside the disk of radius @xmath20 must have perimeter smaller than @xmath107 . since the nodes on the perimeter should be at least @xmath108 away from each other",

    "so far we have shown that any network with fixed separation distance @xmath108 and uniform density , will have maximum coding number of @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is the number of nodes connected to the relay .",
    "in particular , the constant can be determined for any given grid and for the square grid is @xmath114 .",
    "the simulations show that the actual maximum encoding number is approximately half of that calculated above .",
    "the reason for that is basically that the valid polygon is always smaller than the disk of radius @xmath20 and often close to the size of a disk of radius @xmath115 .",
    "it is interesting to bound the achievable maximum coding number from below as well . to obtain intuition about this",

    "figure [ fig : random_prob ] shows the probability of existence of at least one coding combination of size @xmath166 in a network of @xmath1 uniformly thrown nodes . for example , the maximum component size for @xmath200 is either 4 or 6 in the majority of cases .",
    "the simulation results show that in real networks of moderate size the usual combination size is quite small .",
    "the multiplicative constant seems to be close to 1 . in this context",
    ", the focus should be on developing efficient algorithms that opportunistically exploit local network coding over a wide span of topologies using small xor combinations rather than attempting to solve complex combinatorial problems in order to find the best combinations available .     in a network of @xmath1 uniformly thrown nodes .",
    "]      next , we set up a realistic experiment to be run in simulation environment .",
    "a relay node is positioned at the origin , willing to forward any traffic required and apply nc if beneficial .",
    "then , we throw @xmath201 pairs of nodes randomly inside the disk defined by the relay and the communication distance @xmath20 ; note that all nodes are valid nodes .",
    "each pair constitutes a symmetric flow .",
    "each flow may be valid or invalid depending on the distance between the two nodes , see definition in section [ sec : model ] . whenever the flow is invalid",
    ", the nodes communicate directly by exchanging two packets over two slots ( one for each direction ) .",
    "if the flow is valid , the relay is utilized to form a 2-hop linear network .",
    "again , 2 packets are uploaded towards the relay using two slots while the downlink part is left for the end of the frame .",
    "finally , the relay has collected a number of packets which may be combined in several ways using nc . to identify the minimum number of slots required to transmit those packets to the intended receivers",
    ", we solve the problem of minimum clique partition with the constraint of using cliques of size up to @xmath202 ( equivalently , combining up to @xmath8 packets together ) . in the above",
    "we have assumed that all links have equal transmission rates and that the arrival rates of the flows are all equal ( symmetric fair point of operation ) .",
    "the network coding gain is calculated by dividing the number of slots used without nc by the number of slots using nc .",
    "figure [ fig : realistic ] depicts results from simulated random experiments .",
    "evidently , it is enough to combine up to two packets per time in order to enjoy approximately the maximum nc gain .",
    "this example supports the intuition that in practice the network coding gain from large combinations is expected to be negligible .    .",
    "the relay node ( situated at the origin ) assists the flows that can not communicate directly .",
    "we restrict nc combinations to size @xmath8 where @xmath203 . ]",
    "by considering the boolean connectivity model and applying the basic properties required for correct decoding , we showed that for the local network coding there are certain geometric constraints bounding the maximum number of packets that can be encoded together .",
    "particularly , due to the convexity of any valid combination , the sizes of combinations are at most order of @xmath0 for all studied network topologies .",
    "the fact that the number of packets is limited gives rise to approximate algorithms for local coding . instead of attempting to solve the hard problem of calculating all possible coding combinations",
