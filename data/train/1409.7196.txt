    "the evolution of a passive scalar field in hydrodynamic turbulence is a classical problem that is widely studied .",
    "the scalar typically represents a chemical contaminant or admixture that has no dynamical effect on the flow , or small temperature fluctuations in which buoyancy effects are negligible .",
    "indeed , scalar turbulence is important for understanding the dispersal of a pollutant in atmospheric flows , mixing problems in ocean dynamics , and reaction and combustion problems in chemical engineering @xcite .",
    "a concentration of solute also provides a means of flow visualisation in experimental fluid dynamics . in the years since the pioneering studies of @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite a tremendous range of theoretical , computational and experimental investigations have addressed the scalar statistics at the integral , inertial and dissipative scales ( see the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "turbulent mixing also plays an important role in astrophysical systems .",
    "the chemical composition of the intergalactic medium and of galaxy clusters is affected by the turbulent nature of the plasma @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of scintillation measurements of distant radio sources crucially depends on fluctuations of the electron density that is possibly mixed by interstellar turbulence @xcite .",
    "density fluctuations in the solar wind at scales much larger than the plasma microscales ( such as the ion gyroscale and ion inertial length ) are consistent with being passively advected from large to small scales by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "an important property of astrophysical systems is the presence of magnetic fields that can be generated by the turbulent motion of the highly conductive plasma , through a process known as dynamo action ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most important outstanding problems of mhd turbulence is understanding how ordered large - scale magnetic fields are generated out of the small - scale state .",
    "herein , rather than focussing on the dynamo problem , we concentrate on passive scalar mhd turbulence in the presence of a strong uniform background magnetic field .",
    "there are a number of reasons for this choice .",
    "first , considerable progress has been made recently with the theory of strong field - guided mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "these advances have also highlighted a number of issues related to passive scalar evolution , including a description of the dynamically less significant pseudo alfvn fluctuations as being passively advected by the shear alfvn fields .",
    "the presence of residual energy in mhd turbulence and the associated different scalings for the kinetic , magnetic and total energy of the system @xcite also raises the question of whether the spectrum of a passive scalar will follow that of the advecting flow .",
    "moreover , justification for studying the field - guided regime is found by noting that even in the absence of a large - scale magnetic field , locally the magnetic field that is created by the large scale turbulent eddies will play the role of a guiding magnetic field for the small - scale plasma fluctuations .",
    "we note that a numerical study of passive scalar advection in a setting without a large - scale magnetic field has been recently performed by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of a passive scalar in the field - guided case has also been previously addressed in the lower resolution simulations of @xcite , and the related issue of the statistics of tracer particles in field - guided mhd turbulence has been studied by @xcite .",
    "our present work complements these studies .",
    "we conduct a series of high - resolution direct numerical simulations of strong , forced , incompressible , field - guided mhd turbulence in which an additional driven passive scalar field is evolved .",
    "we establish that , since the turbulence is critically balanced , the passive scalar satisfies a yaglom relation which takes into account the anisotropy with respect to the background magnetic field . through studying the properties of the scalar in the statistically steady regime , we analyse the scalar spectrum , anisotropy and intermittency .",
    "we also investigate whether the dynamically less significant pseudo alfvn fields are adequately described by a passive scalar field , and we address the extent to which their statistics are similar to those of the dominant shear alfvn fluctuations .",
    "the equations describing the evolution of a passive scalar field in incompressible mhd turbulence read    [ eq : mhd ] @xmath0",
    "@xmath1 @xmath2    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the velocity , @xmath5 is the magnetic field ( measured in units of the alfvn speed @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the passive scalar quantity , @xmath8 is the pressure , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the fluid viscosity , the magnetic diffusivity and the scalar diffusivity , respectively . henceforth , the magnetic field will be decomposed into the uniform background magnetic field and the fluctuations , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a constant",
    ". the turbulent flow is driven at large scales by the random force @xmath14 . in order to independently drive both elssser populations , @xmath15 ,",
    "we have added a force @xmath16 to the induction equation . in order to measure the properties of the scalar in the statistically steady state",
    "we have also added a large scale driving @xmath17 to the equation for the passive scalar .",
    "the design of our numerical calculations is based on our earlier investigations that have established the properties of the simulation setup that are most conducive to studying strong field - guided mhd turbulence .",
    "details of those calculations and a summary of the findings can be found in  @xcite . here",
    ", we simply state that for all of the calculations reported in this paper we have set @xmath18 ( in units of the rms velocity @xmath19 ) and the domain is elongated in the direction of the background field with the aspect ratio @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the forces @xmath14 and @xmath16 have no component along @xmath22 , are solenoidal in the xy - plane , and are applied in fourier space at the wavenumbers @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the individual random values are chosen from a gaussian distribution with a zero mean .",
    "the values are refreshed independently on average approximately @xmath25 times per large - scale eddy turnover time ( @xmath26 ) and the ratio of the cross helicity to the total energy @xmath27",
    ". the scalar force @xmath17 acts at the same wavenumbers as the elssser driving and has similar statistical properties , except that the scalar amplitudes are updated 10 times more frequently ( to ensure that the rate of passive scalar stirring is fixed ) .",
    "the equations are solved using standard pseudospectral methods . unless otherwise stated , the grid resolution is @xmath28 mesh points , the reynolds number @xmath29 , the magnetic prandtl number @xmath30 and the pclet number @xmath31 .",
    "the numerical results presented correspond to averages over approximately 40 independent snapshots of the system in the statistically steady state .",
    "we begin by establishing one of the central relations in turbulent passive scalar advection , the yaglom relation @xcite . in the inertial interval of the velocity field ,",
    "when the passive scalar stirring and diffusion can be neglected , the relation states that @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the rate of passive scalar dissipation , @xmath36 .",
    "this expression assumes homogeneity of the turbulence but does not require isotropy . in critically balanced anisotropic mhd turbulence we have @xmath37 @xcite , where the subscripts denote the components parallel and perpendicular to the local guiding magnetic field .",
    "we can therefore neglect the parallel gradient in expresssion  ( [ yaglom1 ] ) , and if we then take the point separation vector @xmath38 in the field - perpendicular plane where the turbulence is isotropic we obtain @xmath39 this is a generalisation of the isotropic yaglom relation to anisotropic critically balanced mhd turbulence .",
    "figure  [ fig : yaglom ] shows the results of computing the left and right - hand sides of expression ( [ yaglom2 ] ) from our numerical simulations .",
    "we note that @xmath40 and @xmath41 is to be taken in the plane perpendicular to the local guiding magnetic field . in the case of a strong background field @xmath42",
    "this is approximately the @xmath43-plane . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ fig : yaglom ] illustrates that the simulations reproduce yaglom s relation quite well and indicate the presence of the inertial interval between @xmath45  and  @xmath46 .      in hydrodynamic turbulence ,",
    "the passive scalar spectrum is expected to follow the spectrum of the energy @xcite . however , in mhd turbulence both numerical simulations and physical systems with limited scale separations show that there is a slight but measurable mismatch between the apparent spectra of the kinetic and magnetic energies , the difference being termed the residual energy @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate whether the scalar spectrum in mhd turbulence follows that of the flow , the magnetic field or the total energy .",
    "we define the field - perpendicular spectrum of the quantity @xmath47 ( where @xmath47 represents either the velocity , the magnetic field or the scalar ) by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the two - dimensional fourier transformation of @xmath50 in a plane perpendicular to @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the average is taken over all field - perpendicular planes in the data cube and then over all data cubes ( i.e. , snapshots ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spectra_1024 ] we compare the ( compensated ) scalar spectrum with that of the kinetic , magnetic and total energy for two different values of the pclet number .",
    "the different behaviour of the mhd energies is apparent : the total energy @xmath53 , while the velocity has a spectral exponent that is slightly shallower than @xmath54 and the magnetic spectrum is of higher amplitude and is slightly steeper than @xmath54 .",
    "while it it is difficult to identify the inertial range scaling of the scalar spectrum , especially for the case in which @xmath55 , for larger values of the pclet number the scalar spectrum appears to more closely follow that of the velocity .",
    "we have observed that the passive scalar requires a pclet number a few times larger than the reynolds number to exhibit an inertial interval comparable to that of the advecting velocity field .",
    "since the scalar is advected by a flow in which the field - perpendicular gradients are much larger than the field - parallel ones @xcite , it is natural to expect that the scalar will be more effectively mixed in the field - perpendicular plane . in order to characterise the scalar anisotropy we have calculated the typical field - parallel length scale @xmath56 and the corresponding field - perpendicular length scale @xmath57 .",
    "quite remarkably , we find @xmath58 , independent of the grid resolution and the anisotropy of the scalar force .",
    "thus the scalar rapidly assumes the anisotropy of the advecting velocity field .",
    "+      we now turn to the issue of the pseudo alfvn fluctuations .",
    "we are particularly interested in investigating the similarities and differences with the statistics of the passive scalar field . in strong mhd turbulence",
    "the dominant fluctuations have wavenumbers @xmath59 , and for large @xmath60 the polarisation of the pseudo alfvn fluctuations is almost along the direction of the background field while the shear alfvn waves are polarised perpendicular to @xmath51 .",
    "the equation for the pseudo alfvn fluctuations can therefore be obtained by writing the mhd equations ( [ eq : mhd_u]-c ) in terms of the elssser variables @xmath61 , and taking the field - parallel component : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total pressure ( for simplicity we have set @xmath64 ) .",
    "if we ignore for the moment the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : pa ] ) , then the pseudo alfvn cascade is controlled by the two terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , the latter can be neglected since @xmath67 ( from which it also follows that @xmath68 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we obtain @xmath69 it is due to the resemblance of this equation with ( [ eq : scalar ] ) for the passive scalar ( with the velocity replaced by the shear alfvn fluctuations ) that it is commonly stated that the spectrum of pseudo alfvn fields must follow that of the ` advecting ' shear alfvn fields .",
    "we note however that the right - hand sides of equations ( [ eq : scalar ] ) and ( [ eq : pa_approx ] ) differ through the the presence of the forcing term @xmath70 in the scalar equation and the pressure term @xmath71 in the pseudo alfvn equation .",
    "indeed , in order to simulate the dominant shear alfvn cascade of strong field - guided mhd turbulence cost effectively , in numerical simulations it is typically only the shear alfvn components that are forced .",
    "thus , as shown by ( [ eq : pa_approx ] ) , the only source for the pseudo alfvn fluctuations is the pressure term , which acts at all scales .",
    "this is fundamentally different to the source term for the scalar , which acts only at large scales .    in order to investigate the effects of this difference",
    "we have conducted a series of simulations in which we have added field - parallel forces ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) to the mhd equations ( [ eq : mhd ] ) . as shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : pseudo_spec ] , our findings suggest that when the pseudo alfvn field is not externally forced ( @xmath74 ) its spectrum is governed by the pressure term , and it is therefore different to the spectrum of a passive scalar",
    ". however , when the pseudo alfvn field is forced , the situation is different .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : pseudo_spec ] illustrates the case when the amplitude of @xmath75 is chosen to be a factor of approximately @xmath13",
    "smaller than @xmath76 , so that the total force preferentially excites the shear alfvn waves ( the wavenumbers excited by @xmath75 and timescale of the force remain the same as those for @xmath77 ) .",
    "we observe that while the pressure still acts at all scales , as a result of the the field - parallel forcing the pseudo alfvn spectrum more closely resembles that of the scalar .",
    "+      finally , we investigate the intermittency of the scalar and compare it with that of the shear and pseudo alfvn fluctuations . shown in figure  [ fig : pdf_scalar_r ]",
    "are the histograms of the normalised scalar differences @xmath78 .",
    "the values of the increments @xmath79 are intended to be representative of the forcing scales ( @xmath80 ) , the inertial range ( @xmath81 ) and the dissipative scales ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the scalar statistics are gaussian at large @xmath83 , reflecting the gaussian forcing mechanism , and the scalar becomes increasingly intermittent at smaller scales . a more qualitative measure of the intermittency is given by the kurtosis @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the flatness @xmath86 .",
    "for a gaussian distribution the kurtosis is zero . for the scalar field",
    "we obtain the values @xmath87 for the increments @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "the histograms of the shear and the pseudo alfvn differences ( not shown ) are found to exhibit a qualitatively similar @xmath83-dependent behaviour as for the scalar .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : pdf_scalar_pseudo ] , the intermittency develops more quickly for the shear alfvn fluctuations , with the scalar and the pseudo alfvn fields being closer to gaussian distributions at large @xmath83 . in hydrodynamic turbulence",
    "the passive scalar is known to be more intermittent than the advecting velocity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within the inertial range we find that kurtosis for the scalar and the field - parallel components of the elssser fields and the velocity are similar ( e.g. , for @xmath89 we find @xmath90 for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , respectively ) .",
    "the field - perpendicular velocity is slightly more intermittent ( @xmath94 ) and the considerably more intermittent field - perpendicular elssser field ( @xmath95 ) is found to be largely due the intermittency of the field - perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "we have investigated the statistical properties of a passive scalar field in driven , incompressible , field - guided mhd turbulence .",
    "as well as being a topic of fundamental interest in fluid dynamics , the study was motivated in part by the recent high - resolution numerical simulations and developments in the phenomenological description of mhd turbulence that distinguish the shear alfvn dynamics from the dynamically less significant pseudo alfvn fields and that reveal the presence of a residual energy .",
    "in addition , an understanding of passive scalar evolution in magnetised turbulence forms the first step in modelling and interpreting observations of density fluctuations in astrophysics .    a series of direct numerical simulations have led us to draw the following conclusions .",
    "first , in the inertial interval the passive scalar obeys an anisotropic version of yaglom s relation @xcite . the modified relation ( [ yaglom2 ] )",
    "was derived analytically and confirmed numerically .",
    "second , the spectrum of the scalar follows the velocity field spectrum in terms of its anisotropy and wavenumber scaling , although the inertial interval is shorter and a larger statistical ensemble is required in order to exhibit a good scaling .",
    "third , we have quantified the intermittency of the scalar and compared it with the mhd fluctuations .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that the pseudo alfvn mode is in general not a passive scalar , since it is also driven by the pressure gradient term .",
    "however , if the large - scale driving of the pseudo alfvn mode is strong enough , it can indeed exhibit a passive scalar spectrum .",
