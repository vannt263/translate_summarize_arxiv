    "the most efficient method to determine the age and metallicity for unresolved stellar systems ( especially at high redshift ) is by comparing their observed colours with the predictions of evolution synthesis models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , it is important to test the integrated colours predicted by recent models , based on objects which have accurate ages and metallicities determined independently . in the present paper",
    "we focus our attention on the combination of visual and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry , which has proven to be important for breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy , particularly in stellar populations older than @xmath15  myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope ( spitzer ) _ and mid - infrared ( mir ) instrumentation for some large ground - based telescopes , the nir spectral region is now accessible at intermediate - to - high redshifts . in a recent paper based on _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) imaging , @xcite reported significant discrepancies between some model predictions and the observed rest - frame @xmath16-band properties of early - type galaxies at z @xmath17 .",
    "their results show that the interpretation of nir photometry is hampered by model uncertainties . as a consequence",
    "the determination of masses of distant stellar systems based on such data can have uncertainties up to a factor 2.5 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , providing accurate model predictions in the near - infrared is challenging , since there are limitations imposed by the current lack of understanding of certain stages of stellar evolution ( e.g. , thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch , or tp - agb stars ) .",
    "these objects significantly affect the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the nir and mir for stellar populations with ages between @xmath1 myr to 3 gyr .",
    "another possible complication is that the stellar libraries used by population synthesis models contain mostly stars from the solar neighborhood .",
    "these stars have a star formation history which is not necessarily typical for extragalactic populations ( e.g. relatively little variation of [ @xmath18/fe ] ratios ) , and there are only a very limited number of agb spectra available .    the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc respectively ) provide a unique opportunity to test the accuracy of most current ssp models , since they contain a significant population of intermediate - age massive star clusters which are not easily accessible in our galaxy .",
    "the ages and metallicities of these star clusters can be determined from deep colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) reaching below the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) .",
    "medium and high - resolution spectroscopy of individual giants in these clusters also provides independent metallicity estimates .",
    "therefore their integrated - light properties ( easily observed with small and moderate - aperture telescopes ) can be combined with the accurate age / metallicity measurements and used to test ( and calibrate ) the ssp models .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper  i )",
    "we used the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) to derive nir @xmath19 integrated - light magnitudes and colours for a large sample of magellanic cloud star clusters , based on a homogeneous , accurately calibrated dataset . in the present study we use the sample from paper  i and new photometry for 9 additional objects ( forming the largest dataset of integrated nir magnitudes and colours of lmc / smc star clusters to date ) to test the performance of several ssp models",
    "we combine the 2mass data with optical photometry originating from the work of @xcite and the compilation of @xcite .",
    "the technique adopted in paper  i - measuring @xmath0 curves of growth to large radii allows us to utilize rather heterogeneous databases of optical photometry , usually performed with a set of fixed apertures .",
    "we use 54 clusters from our sample as `` test particles '' .",
    "these clusters were chosen to have reliable age and metallicity measurements , covering a wide parameter space .",
    "-band image is centred on @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the arrow near the centre outlines the position of ngc  1928 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "this cluster is located close to the geometrical centre of the lmc bar , and was adopted by bica et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as a reference point for the relative coordinates of the lmc cluster system .",
    "the labeled arrows show the direction towards the clusters lying outside the boundaries of this chart .",
    "the @xmath24-band image ( g. bothun 1997 , private communication ) covers @xmath25x@xmath25 , while the dimensions of the chart are @xmath26x@xmath26.,width=308 ]    -band image ( g. bothun 1997 , private communication ) is centred on @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "smc clusters cover a smaller area than lmc objects .",
    "there is only one cluster outside the @xmath24 frame , but for illustrational purposes the dimensions of this finder chart are identical to those of the lmc chart in figure  [ fig : lmc_map].,width=308 ]    this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we define our extended sample and present the new photometry along with the compilation of visual magnitudes and colours .",
    "four sets of ssp models are tested in  3 , followed by concluding remarks in  4 .",
    "information about the properties of the cluster sample is presented in appendices a and b. transformations between the model grids in the @xcite system and the photometric system of 2 mass are provided in appendix c. [ intro ]",
