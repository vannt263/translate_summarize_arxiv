    "the nucleon electromagnetic form factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 are fundamental quantities in nuclear and elementary particle physics as they provide information on the spatial distributions of charge and magnetization within the nucleon .",
    "they are a function of the four - momentum transfer squared of the virtual photon , @xmath4 . in the nonrelativistic limit",
    ", they are the fourier transform of the charge and magnetization distributions . therefore",
    ", isolating the up- and down - quark contributions to the nucleon form factors is essential to examine spatial asymmetries in the quark distributions .",
    "there are primarily two methods used to extract the proton form factors .",
    "the first is the rosenbluth or longitudinal - transverse ( lt ) separation method  @xcite which uses measurements of unpolarized cross section , and the second is the polarization transfer / polarized target ( pt ) method  @xcite which requires measurements of the spin - dependent cross section . in the one - photon exchange ( ope )",
    "approximation or the born value , the unpolarized cross section is proportional to the `` reduced '' cross section , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath8 is the virtual photon longitudinal polarization parameter defined as @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the scattering angle of the electron . measuring @xmath11 at several @xmath8 points for a fixed @xmath4 value , one can separate @xmath12 and @xmath13 . however , for cases where @xmath14 is extremely small ( large ) , it is difficult to extract @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) with precision . on the other hand ,",
    "the polarization measurements are sensitive only to the ratio @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , by taking ratios of polarization components , many of the systematic uncertainties in the polarization measurements cancel , allowing for precise measurements of the ratio @xmath16  @xcite , where @xmath17 is the proton magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the two methods yield strikingly different results for the ratio @xmath18 in the region @xmath19  ( gev / c)@xmath20  @xcite , where the rosenbluth extractions show approximate scaling , @xmath21 , while the recoil polarization data indicate a nearly linear decrease in @xmath18 with @xmath4 with some hint of flattening out above 5 ( gev / c)@xmath20 .",
    "recent studies suggest that hard two - photon exchange ( tpe ) corrections to the unpolarized cross section may resolve the discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "recent precise measurements of the neutron s electric to magnetic form factor ratio @xmath22 up to 3.4  gev@xmath20  @xcite , combined with existing @xmath16 measurements in the same @xmath4 range allowed for a separation of the up- and down - quark contributions to the nucleon form factors at large @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this first analysis , referred to as `` cjrw '' in this work , examined the scaling behavior of the up- and down - quark contributions at large @xmath4 , supporting the idea that diquark correlations play an important role  @xcite . recently , we extended the flavor separation analysis  @xcite using combined cross section and polarization measurements of elastic electron - proton scattering with an emphasis on precise new data from ref .",
    "@xcite covering the low - momentum region , which is sensitive to the large - scale structure of the nucleon . in our work",
    ", we account for effects neglected in the original work where we apply tpe corrections in the extraction of the proton form factors based on the approach of ref .",
    "the tpe correction applied in our work , based on the parametrization from ref .",
    "@xcite , is linear in @xmath8  @xcite and vanishes in the limit @xmath23 1  @xcite .",
    "we also compare our results to a parametrization of the proton form factors extracted  @xcite after applying the hadronic calculation for tpe from ref .",
    "we also include additional new @xmath24 data from clas  @xcite and performed a new global fit to @xmath24 which we used , along with the parametrization of @xmath25  @xcite , to construct @xmath26 , as well as account for the uncertainties associated with all of the form factors measurements as the cjrw analysis accounted only for uncertainties on @xmath25 which was the dominant uncertainty for their flavor - separated results .",
    "finally , we use our results of the flavor - separated form factors to construct the flavor - separated dirac , @xmath27 , and pauli , @xmath28 , form factors and their ratios .",
    "in this section , we present our results of the flavor - separated form factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we then compare our results to the cjrw extractions which allows for examination of the effect of the tpe corrections applied , additional uncertainties , as well as updated form factor data set used .",
    "we also compare our results to the venkat _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( `` vamz '' ) , and arrington _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( `` amt '' ) extractions which use improved proton form factor parametrization obtained assuming different treatment of tpe corrections at lower @xmath4 values .",
    "in addition , we used the venkat plus the @xmath24 and @xmath25 fits mentioned above , and looked at the impact of our updated @xmath24 fit by replacing this with the kelly  @xcite fit for @xmath24 ( `` vamz - kelly '' ) .",
    "finally , we compare the results to recent theoretical calculations and fits to the flavor - separated form factors : a dyson - schwinger equation ( `` dse '' ) calculation  @xcite , a pion - cloud relativistic constituent quark model ( `` pc - rcqm '' )  @xcite , a relativistic constituent quark model whose hyperfine interaction is derived from goldstone - boson exchange ( `` gbe - rcqm '' )  @xcite , and a generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) calculations  @xcite .",

    ". however , these predictions are based on fits which included nucleon form factors data , except for the most recent @xmath26 data .",
    "our results for @xmath31 and @xmath32 suggest as well that both form factors continue to rise with increasing @xmath4 but with @xmath32 values somewhat higher than the cjrw extractions at low @xmath4 .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the ratio @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "our results suggest that the down - quark contributions are falling more rapidly than the up - quark contributions at high @xmath4 with respect to the @xmath35 behavior which is more apparent for @xmath34 and the ratio @xmath37 in agreement with global parametrizations and theoretical calculations which predict faster falloff than the apparent @xmath35 scaling behavior . however , such behavior is sensitive to the parametrization of @xmath26 at @xmath38 2 ( gev / c)@xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the difference in the results obtained are attributed mainly to the tpe corrections applied to the proton form factors and to lesser extent to the use of the updated @xmath24 parametrization .",
    "in addition , while the @xmath26 uncertainties have the largest impact , the additional uncertainties from the proton and @xmath24 yield a non - negligible increase in the total uncertainties .     and",

    ", the ratio @xmath48 falls rapidly up to @xmath49 ( gev / c)@xmath20 where it starts to decrease slowly . while our values are somewhat larger than those obtained in the cjrw extractions for @xmath50 1.5 ( gev / c)@xmath20 due to the difference in the @xmath32 values , they are in good qualitative agreement with form factor fits and calculations .",
    "the ratio @xmath39 increases slowly at low @xmath4 and becomes almost constant for @xmath38 1 ( gev / c)@xmath51 .",
    "our results are consistent with both the cjrw results and extractions based on form factors fits .",
    "however , our results differ from all calculations as they predict a rapid falloff of @xmath33 at large @xmath4 compared to @xmath34 which clearly leads to a rapid rise in the ratio",
    ". the high-@xmath4 measurements of @xmath26 planned at jefferson lab after the 12 gev upgrade  @xcite are clearly critical to pin down the behavior of this ratio as well as to examine the theoretical calculations and models .",
