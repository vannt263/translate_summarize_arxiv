    "about 10 low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) are known to show periodic dips in their x - ray light curves and most of them also show x - ray burst activity .",
    "the dip intensities , lengths and shapes change from source to source , and , for the same source , from cycle to cycle .",
    "most of the characteristics of the dips are consistent with a model in which the central x - ray source is temporarily obscured by material in the outer edge of the accretion disc .",
    "this thicker region could be formed by the impact of the gas stream from the roche - lobe filling companion star on the outer rim of the accretion disc .    among the dipping sources ,",
    "xb  1254690 , that also shows type - i x - ray bursts , is peculiar because it showed a cessation of its regular dipping activity ( smale & wachter 1999 ) .",
    "this source was observed for the first time by heao 1 a2 instrument ( mason et al .",
    "1980 ) when an optical burst of @xmath2 s duration occurred .",

    "exosat observations showed the presence of type - i x - ray bursts and led to the discovery of recurrent x - ray dips with a period of @xmath15 hr ( courvoisier , parmar & peacock 1984 ; courvoisier et al .",
    "the duration of the dips was @xmath16 hrs , representing @xmath17 of the binary cycle , with a reduction of the x - ray flux between 20 and 90% . during the dips , x",
    " ray variabilities are present on time scales 1300 s. this complex time structure indicates that the obscuring region is clumpy and of variable size .",
    "a modulation with the same period of the x - ray dips was also observed in optical light curves , with the optical minimum occurring @xmath18 cycles after the x - ray dip ( motch _ et al .",
    "the presence of dips and the lack of eclipse of the x - ray source give a constraint on the inclination angle of the source that is between 65@xmath19 and 73@xmath19 ( courvoisier et al .",
    "1986 , motch _",
    "x - ray bursts and x - ray dips were also present in a ginga observation performed on august 1990 ( uno et al .",
    "1997 ) . on the other hand the dips",
    "were not present in a rxte observation in 1997 between april 28 and may 1 ( smale & wachter , 1999 ) .",
    "the cessation of the dipping activity indicates that the angular size of the disk edge ( at the impact point with the accretion stream ) decreased from @xmath20 to less than @xmath21 ( smale & wachter , 1999 ) .",
    "there is no evidence of a simultaneous variation of the accretion rate or the location of the outer rim of the accretion disk ( smale & wachter , 1999 ) .",
    "the energy spectrum of xb  1254690 in the 110 kev energy range , observed by _ exosat _ , was fitted by thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath22 kev , and the corresponding flux was @xmath23 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 ( courvoisier et al .",
    "1986 ) , although other models could not be excluded .",
    "the spectrum obtained by _",
    "ginga _ in the 235 kev range was fitted by a blackbody plus a power law with exponential cutoff , or by a multicolor disk blackbody plus a comptonized blackbody , where the electron temperature of the hot plasma is fixed at 100 kev and the optical depth is @xmath18 ( uno et al .",
    "neither model gave acceptable residuals .",
    "the fits were partially improved including extra components like a gaussian line centered at 6.36.7 kev .",
    "we report here the results of a broad band ( 0.1100 kev ) spectral analysis performed on data from the bepposax satellite .",
    "the broad energy band of bepposax narrow field instruments allows us to well constrain the spectrum of this source , and to detect the presence of a high energy component .",
    "the narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on board bepposax satellite ( boella et al .",
    "1997 ) observed xb  1254690 on 1998 december 22 and 23 , for a total exposure time of 45 ks .",
    "the nfis are four co - aligned instruments which cover more than three decades of energy , from 0.1 kev up to 200 kev , with good spectral resolution in the whole range . the lecs ( operating in the range 0.110 kev ) and the mecs ( 1.810 kev ) have imaging capabilities with field of view ( fov ) of @xmath26 and @xmath27 radius , respectively .",
    "we selected data for scientific analysis in circular regions , centered on the source , of @xmath28 and @xmath29 radii for lecs and mecs , respectively .",
    "the background subtraction was obtained using blank sky observations in which we extracted the background spectra in regions of the fov similar to those used for the source .",
    "hpgspc ( 760 kev ) and pds ( 13200 kev ) are non - imaging instruments , because their fovs , of @xmath30 fwhm , are delimited by collimators .",
    "the background subtraction for these instruments is , generally , obtained using the off - source data accumulated during the rocking of the collimators .",
    "however , during this observation , the hpgspc collimator did not execute the rocking , neither data during the earth occultation were available , because of the high latitude of the source , to do a proper subtraction of the background .",
    "therefore we could not use the hpgspc data .",
    "the energy range used in the spectral analysis for the other nfis is : 0.124 kev for the lecs , 1.810 kev for the mecs and 15100 kev for the pds .",
    "different normalizations of the nfis are considered in the spectral fitting by including in the model normalizing factors , fixed to 1 for the mecs , and kept free for the other instruments .",
    "we rebinned the energy spectra in order to have at least 25 counts / channel and to sample the instrument resolution with the same number of channels at all energies .",
    "in figure 1 we plotted the xb  1254690 light curve in the energy bands 1.810 kev ( mecs data , upper panel ) , and 15100 kev ( pds data , lower panel ) using a bin time of 256 s. during our observation the light curves do not show significant variability .",
    "in particular , the count rate ranges between 8 and 9 counts / s in the mecs , without displaying the regular reduction of flux ( generally @xmath31 ) that is typical of this source during the dipping activity .",
    "the total observation time is @xmath32 ks , and therefore the bepposax observation should contain 6 complete orbital cycles . considering that the dips are usually observed at every orbital cycle ( only one dip has been skipped before the rxte observation , see smale & wachter 1999 ) , we should observe 6 dips in the bepposax light curve .",
    "none of them is visible in figure 1 .",
    "we also divided the mecs data into two energy bands , soft ( 1.84 kev ) and hard ( 410 kev ) , and calculated the corresponding hardness ratio .",
    "the hardness ratio is constant implying that no spectral variations are present .",
    "this confirms the absence of dips during our observation , because dips are usually associated with an increase of the low energy absorption , and therefore with an anti - correlation between hardness ratio and intensity .",
    "this cessation of the dipping activity was also observed in a previous rxte observation ( 1997 may , smale & wachter 1999 ) , indicating that the cessation of the dipping activity might be a long - lived phenomenon",
    ".    the observed average flux of the source in the 110 kev energy range is @xmath33 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 , which , adopting a distance of 10 kpc ( courvoisier _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , motch _",
    "1987 ) , corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath34 ergs / s .",
    "this is compatible with the previously reported persistent luminosity of the x - ray source of @xmath35 ergs / s in the same energy band ( courvoisier _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , motch _",
    "the observed flux of the source in the 0.1100 kev energy range is @xmath36 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 , which corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath37 ergs / s .",
    "note that the diffuse x  ray emission from the thin disk surrounding the galactic midplane ( the so - called galactic ridge ) , could affect the background of sources near the galactic plane .",
    "valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) reported rxte measurements of the diffuse x - ray galactic emission in different galactic regions . for latitudes @xmath38 and longitudes @xmath39 , they find that the diffuse galactic average surface brightness is @xmath40 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 sr@xmath25 in the 210 kev band , which corresponds to a flux of @xmath41 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 in the mecs fov . in the same range",
    "the flux of xb 1254 - 690 is @xmath42 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 , several orders of magnitude above the diffuse galactic emission . at higher energies ( 1060  kev ) the galactic ridge emission shows a power - law tail with photon index @xmath43 , the flux of which is @xmath44 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 in the pds fov ( @xmath45  fwhm )",
    "this is comparable to the flux , in the same range , of the bremsstrahlung hard - tail alone ( see below ) , which results @xmath46 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 .",
    "however , considering that the diffuse galactic emission drops rapidly with increasing latitude , the relative flux is lower in the region of xb 1254690 , which corresponds to @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath49 the galactic ridge flux has a broad distribution , that is a gaussian function with @xmath50 ( see fig .",
    "2b in valinia & marshal 1998 ) .",
    "we calculated that the flux in the 1060  kev band as a function of the latitude @xmath51 is : @xmath52\\ ] ] in ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 sr@xmath25 deg@xmath25 , where we assumed @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath54 the expected galactic ridge flux is @xmath55 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath25 in the pds fov , much lower than the flux in the bremsstrahlung hard tail .",
    "a simple model consisting of a single component , like a power law multiplied by an exponential cutoff , or a comptonized spectrum ( hereafter _ compst _ , sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) , plus photoelectric absorption by cold matter , was not sufficient to fit the spectrum in the whole energy band .",
    "in fact a soft excess and a tail at energies higher than 20 kev are present in the residuals . using the compst model ( see table 1 , model 1 ) we obtained @xmath56 . using the more recent _ comptt _ model ( titarchuk et .",
    "_ al _ , 1994 ) , instead of _ compst _ , we obtain a seed - photon temperature @xmath57 kev , close to the limit of the low energy instrument .",
    "because of low energy absorption by the interstellar medium and the low statistics at these energies , the seed - photon temperature has a large error and can not be determined reliably .",
    "therefore we decided to use the _ compst _ model , which , in this case ( low temperatures and high optical depths ) , gives a fit equivalent to that with comptt , with similar values of the electron temperature and the optical depth .",
    "the same choice was made by barret et _",
    "al_. ( 2000 ) for the source ks 1731360 .",
    "we added a multicolor disk blackbody ( hereafter _ mcd _ , mitsuda et _ al .",
    "_ 1984 ) to the previous model to fit the soft excess ( see table 1 , model 2 ) .",
    "an f - test indicates that the addition of this component improved the fit with high statistical significance ( probability of chance improvement @xmath58 ) .",
    "the addition of mcd did not eliminate the feature present at the high energy . the broad band ( 0.1100 kev ) spectrum is shown in figure 2 ( upper panel ) , and the residual ( in units of @xmath59 ) with respect to this model are shown in figure 2 ( middle panel ) , where the high energy feature above 20 kev is clearly visible .",
    "this hard excess can not be fitted by the two - component models that we tried .",
    "therefore we added an other component to the previous model .",
    "the addition of a bremsstrahlung component fits the data at energies higher than 20 kev , reducing the @xmath60 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 ( table 1 , model 3 ) .",
    "the improvement of the fit is significant at @xmath63 confidence level .",
    "however other models for this high energy component , such as a power law with high energy cutoff , can not be excluded .",
    "we note that the hard excess can not be fitted by a reflection model : using blackbody plus _ pexriv _ model ( magdziarz & zdziarski , 1995 ) we obtain @xmath64 .",
    "finally the addition of an absorption edge at 1.26 kev gave a further improvement of the fit at @xmath65 confidence level .",
    "the residuals ( in unit of @xmath59 ) corresponding to the best fit model are shown in figure 2 ( lower panel ) , and the corresponding values of the parameters are shown in table 1 ( model 4 ) . in figure 3",
    "we show the unfolded spectrum and the best fit model .",
    "we obtain a hydrogen equivalent column @xmath66 @xmath24 , in agreement with previous results ( exosat observation , courvoisier _ et al .",
    "the soft component is consistent with emission from an accretion disk with an inner disc temperature @xmath0 kev , and an inner radius @xmath67 km for a distance of 10 kpc .",
    "the comptonized component originates from the comptonization of soft seed photons in a hot ( @xmath68 kev ) corona of moderate optical depth ( @xmath69 for a spherical geometry ) .",
    "the high energy spectrum is fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung corresponding to a temperature of @xmath2 kev and a luminosity of @xmath70 ergs / s , that is @xmath7 of the total observed luminosity .",
    "finally , we find an absorption edge at an energy of @xmath12 kev , with an optical depth of 0.15 . on the other hand we do not observe an iron k - edge at 7.1 kev , with an upper limit , at @xmath71 confidence level , on the optical depth of @xmath72 .",
    "also , we do not observe an iron emission line at 6.46.7 kev .",
    "the upper limit on the equivalent width is 18 ev for a narrow line at 6.4 kev ( @xmath73 kev ) and 15 ev for an iron line at 6.7 kev with @xmath74 kev .",
    "we analyzed data of the dipping source xb  1254690 from a bepposax 90 ks observation in the energy range 0.1100 kev .",
    "the light curve does not show periodic modulations or dipping episodes . on the contrary",
    ", it is quite constant with a count rate around 10 counts / s in the mecs .",
    "this source has shown periodical dips every orbital period of @xmath75 hrs ( courvoisier et al .",
    "1986 ) . during these dips , which last about 0.8 hr per cycle ,",
    "usually the 110 kev flux is reduced up to 95% .",
    "the cessation of the dipping activity was observed for the first time in a rxte observation in 1997 , from april 28 to may 1 ( smale & wachter 1999 ) , and it was ascribed to a reduction of the scale height of the disk to less than @xmath21 .",
    "our bepposax data indicate that cessation of the dipping activity was also present in december 1998",
    ". therefore it does not seem to be a short - lived phenomenon .",
    "moreover it is not associated with evident changes in the x - ray flux , because the persistent luminosity during the bepposax observation , @xmath76 ergs / s , is not different from previous measurements ( courvoisier _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , motch _",
    "1987 ) .",
    "we performed a spectral analysis of xb  1254690 , and the results are discussed in the following . for the equivalent absorption column @xmath77 we obtained a value of @xmath78 @xmath24 in agreement with previous observations ( courvoisier _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ) . for a distance to the source of 10",
    "kpc ( courvoisier _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , motch _",
    "1987 ) the visual extinction in the direction of xb  1254690 is @xmath79 mag ( hakkila et al .",
    "1997 ) . using the observed correlation between visual extinction and absorption column ( predehl & schmitt 1995 )",
    "we find @xmath80 @xmath24 , similar to the value obtained by the spectral fit .    a three - temperature model plus an absorption edge are needed to fit the broad band spectrum .",
    "the first component , in order of increasing temperature , is a soft emission that can be described by a multicolor disk blackbody .",
    "we obtain an inner disk temperature of @xmath0 kev and an inner radius of the disk of @xmath67 km .",
    "this source is a dipper so the inclination angle of the normal to the disk plane with respect to the line of sight should be between @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( courvoisier et al .",
    "1986 , motch et al .",
    "1987 ) . assuming an inclination angle @xmath5 of @xmath81 we obtain @xmath83 km . moreover ,",
    "because the electron scattering can modify the spectrum ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; white , stella & parmar 1988 ) , we have corrected the value of the inner radius and its temperature for this effect .",
    "the measured color temperature is related to the effective temperature of the inner disk by the relation @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the spectral hardening factor .",
    "it was estimated to be @xmath3 for a luminosity @xmath86 of the eddington limit ( shimura & takahara 1995 ; merloni et al . , 2000 ) . applying this correction to the values of @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "reported in table 1 ( model 4 ) we obtain an effective temperature of @xmath89 kev which corresponds to an inner radius @xmath90 km . for @xmath91",
    "we obtain @xmath92 km .",
    "we identify this soft component with emission from the accretion disk .",
    "in fact given the high inclination of the system , we expect that the emission of the neutron star will not be directly observed because it is probably reprocessed by the corona that originates the comptonized component .    from the soft component , interpreted as emission from the accretion disk",
    ", we can calculate the mass accretion rate of the system .",
    "the luminosity of this component is @xmath93 , where d is the distance to the system and f is the flux measured from the earth .",
    "using the values reported in table 1 ( model 4 ) , we obtain @xmath94 ergs / s .",
    "this is also equal to the potential energy of the matter released at the inner radius of the disk , @xmath95 .",
    "the accretion rate we derive from this relation is @xmath96 g / s @xmath97 g / s .",
    "the corresponding total luminosity is @xmath98 ergs / s , similar to the observed luminosity of @xmath99 ergs / s .",
    "the second component of our model is a comptonized spectrum , produced in a hot ( @xmath100 kev ) region of moderate optical depth ( @xmath69 , for a spherical geometry ) probably surrounding the neutron star .",
    "adopting the geometry described above one would expect a compton reflection of the hard spectrum emitted by the corona from the accretion disk .",
    "this would produce a bump in the energy spectrum as well as an emission line at @xmath101 kev and an edge at @xmath102 kev from neutral iron ( _ e.g. _ george & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola , & piro 1991 )",
    ". this reflection signatures are not present in xb  1254690 .",
    "indeed the upper limit to the equivalent width of an iron line at @xmath101 kev is @xmath103 ev . a possible reason could be the high inclination , that reduces the amount of reflection seen . moreover , because of the low temperature of the corona , most of the hard photons have energies below 10 kev , and therefore they will be photoelectric absorbed by the matter in the disk and re - emitted at the temperature of the disk rather than compton scattered .",
    "the comptonizing region could be identified with an inner , optically thick ( @xmath69 ) corona probably surrounding the neutron star .",
    "its relatively low electron temperature ( @xmath1 kev ) is determined by compton cooling due to the soft emission of the neutron star intercepted by the corona .",
    "another possible origin of this comptonized spectrum could be the boundary layer between the neutron star and the accretion disk . in neutron star binaries an",
    "expanded , hot , low density boundary layer should exist , which cools by inverse compton scattering of the soft photons emitted by the neutron star surface ( popham & sunyaev 2000 ) .",
    "popham & sunyaev ( 2000 ) predict that for an accretion rate around @xmath104 g / s ( corresponding to the the observed luminosity of xb  1254690 ) , the electron temperature of the boundary layer is around 1.5 - 2 kev , in agreement with the value obtained from our analysis .",
    "moreover , the model predicts that the boundary layer has a radius of @xmath105 km , similar to the inner radius of the accretion disk that we obtain from the data ( @xmath106 km ) . in this scenario",
    "the scale height of the boundary layer is @xmath107 km , and therefore it can easily occult the emission of the neutron star from direct observation given the high inclination ( @xmath108 ) of the system .",
    "this is in agreement with our identification of the observed soft component with emission from the accretion disk , instead of emission from the neutron star surface .",
    "the spectrum described above is similar to that of other type - i x - ray bursters ( see _ e.g. _ guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 , barret et al .",
    "2000 , di salvo et al .",
    "2000 ) . for these sources",
    "the electron temperature of the scattering region is between 3 and 28 kev and the optical depth between 3 and 10 , with higher temperatures corresponding to lower optical depths . in xb  1254690",
    "the temperature of the scattering region is @xmath1 kev and the optical depth is @xmath6 .",
    "an interesting feature , in xb  1254690 , is the presence of a hard component , that can be fitted with a high temperature ( @xmath2 kev ) bremsstrahlung .",
    "this is a low luminosity ( @xmath109 ergs / s ) component , contributing only @xmath7 of the total luminosity .",
    "this can explain why we observe such a component in a high inclination source .",
    "in fact in this case the luminosity of other components , _",
    "e.g. _ the disk , is lowered by the geometrical factor @xmath110 . also",
    "the low temperature of the comptonized spectrum enhances the possibility to observe such a component .    assuming the bremsstrahlung normalization as : @xmath111 where d is the distance to the source in cm , n@xmath112 is the electron density ( @xmath11 ) and v is the volume of the bremsstrahlung emitting region , and using the value of @xmath113 reported in table 1 ( model 4 )",
    ", we obtain an emission measure of @xmath114 @xmath11 .",
    "this value requires large emission volumes for reasonable electron densities . considering an optical depth @xmath115 and a spherical volume for the bremsstrahlung emitting region",
    ", the condition above gives a radius of @xmath116 km , that is an order of magnitude smaller than the accretion disk radius ( that is @xmath117 km as reported by courvoisier et al .",
    "1986 ) .    in neutron star binaries an accretion disk corona ( hereafter adc ) should be present ( _ e.g. _ white & holt 1982 ) , probably formed by evaporation of the outer layers of the disk illuminated by the emission of the central object . the partial eclipses observed in the light curves of sources viewed almost edge - on indicates that these adcs are extended , with radii that can be a fraction of the accretion disk radius .",
    "we suggest that the high temperature bremsstrahlung component is emitted in an extended , optically thin adc . in this hypothesis",
    "the volume of the bremsstrahlung emitting region can be written as @xmath118 ; the adc radius @xmath119 , according to white & holt ( 1982 ) , can be obtained by @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the mass of the compact object , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are mass and radius of the sun , and @xmath124 is the adc temperature in units of @xmath125 k. substituting @xmath2 kev for the adc temperature and 1.4 @xmath122 for the neutron star mass we obtain @xmath126 km , similar to the value obtained above considering an optically thin emitting region .",
    "assuming @xmath113 as reported in table 1 ( model 4 ) , we obtain @xmath10 @xmath127 .",
    "we also calculated the optical depth of this region . using the thomson cross section , the adc radius as geometrical depth and the density of the region as reported above",
    ", we obtain @xmath128 .",
    "finally , in the spectrum of xb  1254690 an absorption edge , at the energy of @xmath129 kev with an optical depth of @xmath13 , is also present .",
    "its energy is compatible with the energy of k - edges of ne x or neutral mg , or with the l - edge of fe xvii .",
    "notably no other edges are present in the spectrum . in particular we do not observe an iron k - edge at @xmath102 kev , with an upper limit on the optical depth of 0.033",
    ". a possible reason could be the softness of the comptonized spectrum .",
    "its temperature is @xmath1 kev , and hence the spectrum fastly decreases at higher energies , reducing the number of photons at @xmath102 kev that would be able to produce the iron k - edge .",
    "the same results are also obtained for another high inclination lmxb , x 1822371 ( parmar _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . in that case",
    "an edge at @xmath130 kev , compatible with the energy we measure in xb  1254690 , is required in both the bepposax and asca spectra .",
    "we analyzed data from a bepposax observation of xb  1254690 performed in 1998 december 22 and 23 .",
    "neither x  ray bursts nor x  ray dips were present during this observation .",
    "the energy spectrum is described by a multicolor disk blackbody , with an inner temperature of @xmath0 kev and an inner disk radius of @xmath131 km , a comptonized spectrum , and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the comptonized spectrum is produced in a relatively cool ( @xmath1 kev ) region of moderate optical depth ( @xmath69 for a spherical geometry ) , probably surrounding the neutron star .",
    "this region could be identified with an inner optically thick corona or with the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the neutron star .",
    "the presence of reflection signatures is not detected with high statistical significance probably because of the high inclination of the system .",

    "<S> adopting a distance of 10 kpc and taking into account a spectral hardening factor of @xmath3 ( because of electron scattering which modifies the blackbody spectrum emitted by the disk ) we estimated that the inner disk radius is @xmath4 km , where @xmath5 is the inclination angle of the system with respect to the line of sight . </S>",

    "<S> the bremsstrahlung emission , contributing @xmath7 of the total luminosity , probably originates in an extended accretion disk corona with radius @xmath8 cm . in this scenario we calculated that the optical depth of this region is @xmath9 and its mean electron density is @xmath10 @xmath11 . </S>",
