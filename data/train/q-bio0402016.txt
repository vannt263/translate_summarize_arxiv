    "the penna model @xcite is popular and efficient way to simulate biological aging in genetically heterogeneous population ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "it is based on _ the mutation accumulation _ theory which claims that random hereditary deleterious mutations accumulate over several generations in the species genome @xcite .",
    "the model is governed by a set of parameters such as environmental capacity @xmath0 so that the actual population @xmath1 .",
    "the birth rate @xmath2 is the number of offsprings from a single parent per evolution time step , providing the parent reached age @xmath3 and is still below maximum reproduction age @xmath4 .",
    "other parameters which control the growth of the population are : number of mutations @xmath5 injected into the baby s genome , apart from the already inherited , and threshold value @xmath6 of _ active _ bad mutations above which items are eliminated for this only reason .    in this paper",
    "we would like to check how model control parameters ( described in the next section ) influence the size @xmath7 of the stable population for long times @xmath8 when _ mutational meltdown _",
    "@xcite is avoided .",
    "in the penna model @xcite each individual in the population is characterised by its genome  the @xmath9-long binary string .",
    "time is measured by a discrete variable @xmath10 . in each time step ( @xmath11 ) , for each individual of age @xmath12 , the number of bits set to one in the first @xmath12 positions @xmath13 in genome is calculated .",
    "bit ` 1 ' represents a bad mutation activated when its position @xmath14 , however mutations above @xmath15 are not harmful . if the number of _ bad _ and _ active _ mutations is greater or equal to the threshold value @xmath6 an individual dies due to too many deleterious mutations and so called _ genetic death _ takes place",
    ".    individuals competite among themselves for food and territory : each of them may be removed from the population with probability @xmath16 , where @xmath0 represents the maximal environmental capacity .",
    "in other words , we introduce the verhulst s factor in order to avoid exponential growth of the population size to infinity .",
    "the number @xmath9 of bits in genome restricts also maximal age of individuals .",
    "we start the simulation with @xmath17 individuals which genomes contain only ` 0 ' ( no bad mutations ) .",
    "the population reproduces asexually .",
    "if the individual is older than minimum reproduction age @xmath3 it is able with the probability @xmath18 to give @xmath2 offsprings .",
    "the offspring s genome is a copy of parent s one , exposed during replication to @xmath5 harmful mutations .",
    "each mutation occurs with probability @xmath19 at randomly chosen position in the genome .",
    "we also introduce a maximum reproduction age @xmath4 , so the individual older than @xmath4 do not clone itself any more .",
    "we would like to refer our results to the standard one ( labelled as ` std ' in all figures ) which we assume to be for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the influence of the @xmath9 on population characteristics was discussed earlier in @xcite . the maximal environment capacity @xmath0 is fixed during simulation .",
    "the initial concentration of individuals in respect to maximal environmental capacity do not influence the results ( fig .",
    "[ fig](a ) ) .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) + ( c ) ( d ) + ( e ) ( f ) + ( g ) ( h )    as one may expect the larger probability of reproduction @xmath30 gives the larger population size ( fig .",
    "[ fig](b ) ) .",
    "the population size decreases when the probability of mutations @xmath31 increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig](c ) ) .",
    "the same situation is for integer variables @xmath2 and @xmath5 ( see figs . [",
    "fig](d ) and [ fig](e ) , respectively ) .",
    "if the number of mutations is too large ( i.e. @xmath32 ) the mutational meltdown occurs .",
    "also too large value of the number of offsprings ( e.g. @xmath33 ) may lead to catastrophe : too rapid growth of the population may cause that in one time step the environmental maximal capacity @xmath0 will be exceeded . as a consequence of that the population will vanish _ only _ due to verhulst s factor and not the genetic one . in our implementation products @xmath34 and @xmath35 may be considered as the average number of mutations per individual s genome and as the average number of offsprings given every year per reproductive individual ( i.e. in age @xmath36 ) , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig](f ) the influence of the threshold @xmath6 on the population size is presented .",
    "decreasing the threshold @xmath6 results in increasing of the stable population size .",
    "setting @xmath37 eliminates genetic death and again only verhulst s factor determinates @xmath38 .",
    "delay in starting the reproduction decreases the population size as presented in fig .  [ fig](g ) .",
    "obviously , setting @xmath39 destroys population because individuals never replicate themselves . for @xmath40",
    " when all newly born babies become adults as quickly as possible  a very strong oscillations appear ( not shown ) .",
    "[ fig](h ) shows the influence of the maximal reproduction age @xmath4 on the stable population size . for @xmath41 ,",
    "when individual reproduce _ only once _",
    "( semelparous organisms @xcite ) oscillations in the population size appears ( not shown ) .",
    "the population size of the stable population in the penna model was already investigated for a certain purpose , e.g. : showing advantage of sexual reproduction on asexual one @xcite , studying sexual fidelity of males vs higher reproduction rate @xcite , modelling fishing and/or hunting @xcite , explaining mystery of pacific salmon senescence @xcite , analysing pray - predator systems @xcite , recovering demographic data @xcite , modelling the oldest old effect @xcite , modelling consequence of parental care @xcite , studying the individuals fertility @xcite , studying the migration effect @xcite , and others @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we confine our attention to the basic features of the model .",
    "main results were collected in figs .",
    "we may conclude the following :    1 .",
    "different time scales must be accounted for , if the ` stable ' refers to different properties observed in the computer experiment ; * total population @xmath7 shows values that do not change significantly after about one hundred iteration steps , * however , we need at least a couple of thousand steps for age distribution @xcite and , especially , bad mutations distributions in a genome position @xcite , to become stationary .",
    "2 .   obviously for smaller birth rates",
    "@xmath35 the population is smaller .",
    "however , unlike the logistic model for which @xmath42 @xcite , the penna model shows a critical @xmath43 below which the population is extinct .",
    "this is due to the genetic death as result of pumping in more and more mutations @xmath5 into each new generation , and so @xmath44 with the limit @xmath45 for @xmath46 , the logistic case .",
    "3 .   when the number of bad mutations @xmath5 injected into baby s genome is scaned from @xmath46 ( the logistic model ) , the upper limit @xmath47 for the extinction strongly depends on fertility : * if @xmath2 is smaller , @xmath47 is also smaller , and * for sufficiently large @xmath2 , @xmath48 as the high birth rate gives a chance to new population ( however rich in bad mutations ) to reproduce before it dies out soon on reaching the threshold @xmath6 .",
    "this is so if the minimum reproduction age @xmath3 is sufficiently small to allow for the reproduction .",
    "the upper age limit @xmath4 for reproduction influence the stable population @xmath49 and larger @xmath4 makes bigger @xmath49 , as it may be expected .",
    "this time , however , we do not observe any critical behaviour when we scan @xmath4 .",
