    "this analysis is inspired by similar analyses in bosonic liouville theory @xcite@xcite , and in supersymmetric liouville theory at level @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we start from the definition of the continuous branes ( [ cardy ] ) , ( [ psic ] )",
    ". the continuous branes do not couple to discrete bulk operators .",
    "the overlap of the two branes gives in the bulk channel : @xmath65 we obtain the partition function in the loop channel via a modular transformation :    @xmath66    now we would like to write the boundary partition function @xmath67 in a more explicit form as an integral over boundary operators with a given spectral density : z_1,2 & = & _ p=-+i^+i _ 1(p;p_1 , p_2 ) ch_c^open(p,m_1- m_2 ) + & & + _ p=-+i^+i _ 2(p;p_1,p_2 ) ch_c^open ( p,m_1-m_2 + ) .",
    "notice the imaginary shift @xmath68 in the integration contour .",

    "looking at the integrand in ( [ zopen1 ] ) , we identify two possible divergences at @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "firstly , the integral is always divergent when the bulk momentum @xmath30 goes to zero .",
    "notice that the behavior of the integrand close to @xmath70 is universal : it does not depend on the brane parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "it is an infrared divergence due to the non - compactness of the target space .",
    "we can cure the divergence either by considering a relative spectral density ( subtracting a reference spectral density with fixed value of the brane parameters ) , or by removing the pole by hand .",
    "secondly , the bulk momentum integral may still diverge due to the ultraviolet integration region .",
    "a prescription to cure this divergence @xcite is to lift the integration contour for the boundary momentum @xmath69 by giving it a sufficient imaginary part @xmath68",
    ". then the integrand will decay exponentially at large momentum @xmath30 , and we will be able to exchange the order of integration .",
    "let s compute the necessary shift of the contour @xmath68 . at large momentum @xmath30",

    "the integrand in the last two lines of equation ( [ zopen1 ] ) is always less divergent .",
    "we deduce that we need to shift the integration contour when @xmath73 .",
    "we recall that we took the imaginary parts of @xmath74 to be positive .",
    "the imaginary part we give to the boundary momentum @xmath69 is : [ a ] =( 0 , im(p_1 ) + im(p_2 ) - + ) with @xmath75 .",
    "since we have the inequality @xmath76 , we need both @xmath60 and @xmath61 imaginary to have a non - zero shift ( or one of them equal to @xmath77 , in which case @xmath78 ) .    after giving a sufficiently large imaginary part to the boundary momentum ( which breaks parity symmetry in @xmath69 ) , we find the following densities of boundary operators : @xmath79 the densities @xmath80 and @xmath81 are functions of the boundary momentum @xmath69 as well as the two brane parameters @xmath60 and @xmath82 . for given brane parameters , one can extend these functions over the whole complex plane in @xmath69 , and identify their poles .",
    "one can then bring the @xmath69 integral back to the real line ( in order for the continuous part of the spectrum to correspond to continuous characters ) , pick up the poles crossed in the process , and identify them as isolated contributions to the partition function .    to analyze the pole structure of the densities of states @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we can rewrite these densities as the derivatives of phase shifts .",
    "we can perform the rewriting in terms of the q - gamma function @xmath83 .",
    "it is defined as ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "this function has poles at @xmath86 , where @xmath13 and @xmath87 are positive integers . with @xmath88 and @xmath89 ,",

    "we note that we subtracted a universal part in the densities that does not depend on the parameters of the branes @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the subtraction regularizes the bulk infrared divergence due to the infinite volume of the target space .",
    "we can identify which poles are met when we bring back the @xmath69 integration contour to the real axis ( cf .",

    "given that @xmath76 , there is only one pole in the spectral density @xmath80 that will be crossed as we shift the boundary momentum contour to the real axis : the one from the first series in equation ( [ poles ] ) with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the residue for this pole is @xmath94 .",
    "the contour of the integral with the spectral density @xmath81 will not cross a pole when @xmath1 is greater than one .    .",

    "becomes of conformal dimension zero .",
    "there the continuous character @xmath104 splits into two discrete and one identity characters , according to the identity ( [ 1stidex ] ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that the way the correct multiplicity @xmath94 for the discrete characters comes about in the algebraic calculation is via a multiplicity @xmath106 from the overlap of identity brane with the discrete branes in the addition relation , and multiplicity @xmath107 from the self - overlap of the sum of the discrete boundary states .",
    "that fact will be important later on .",
    "firstly , as we noted in passing , the case @xmath32 needs to be studied separately . for @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath108 the self - overlap picks up a pole in the density @xmath80 as before .",
    "moreover , a pole in the spectral density @xmath81 coincides with the contour of integration in that case . that is due to a boundary infrared divergence .",
    "the integration can be regularized with a principal value prescription .",
    "equivalently , we pick up the pole with weight a half ( multiplied by the prefactor of @xmath109 associated to the density of states @xmath81 ) . that leads to an extra contribution of a single continuous character with @xmath110 to the boundary spectrum .",
    "it implies that both discrete characters appear with multiplicity two in the self - overlap of the brane ( [ z00 ] ) .",
    "the same conclusion is reached independently in appendix [ discretecouplings ] .",
    "there it is shown that there are no discrete subtractions in this case .",
    "the upshot is an agreement with the discussion in @xcite from both ways of calculating the self - overlap .",
    "secondly , we obtained the localized spectrum for generic level @xmath1 in two ways : on the one hand via the analytic continuation of the self - overlap , and on the other hand using the full identity and discrete boundary states including their coupling to the discrete ishibashi states .",
    "we believe that provides a convincing crosscheck for these two procedures .",
    "this is important because it indicates that we should take the couplings of the discrete branes to discrete ishibashi states seriously .",
    "it implies in particular that discrete branes do not ( generically ) pass the cardy check .",
    "we note that there may be exchange of discrete states between boundary states despite the fact that no pole appears in the density of exchanged bulk operators .",
    "whether a discrete state is exchanged is determined by its coupling to both branes , and when these are non - zero , the contribution is weighted by the propagator .",
    "when one brane in the overlap is localized , those contributions correspond to the formal prescription to pick up possible poles and their residues in the bulk channel - why this is the case can be understood from the modular bootstrap ( see e.g.@xcite ) . that the prescription to pick up poles in the bulk channel",
    "only works when one of the two branes is localized seems related to the observation @xcite that an analogue of the verlinde formula in non - rational conformal field theories works well only in those cases .    in the dual boundary channel , it is the contour dictated by the precise boundary conditions that determine whether or not poles in the density of boundary operators contribute to the annulus amplitude @xcite .",
    "we finalize this section by a few remarks on the semi - classic target space interpretation of the boundary conformal field theories .",
    "the semi - classical geometry has been described in e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite in some detail .",
    "we add a few extra remarks to those analyses that will be useful in the following .",

    "this analysis will break down close to @xmath24 , where the geometry is singular ( but the conformal field theory remains well - defined ) .",
    "the identity branes are located in that region .",
    "studying solutions that extremize the dirac - born - infeld action for d1-branes in the background ( [ trumpet ] ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) , one finds the following two - parameter family of branes : [ extbranelsc ] ( r ) ( -_0 ) = c if @xmath112 , we put @xmath113 . in this case",
    "the brane world - volume is limited to the region @xmath114 . on the other hand , if @xmath115 , the brane extends over the whole space - time .",
    "when we go to radial infinity , the function @xmath116 goes to zero .",

    "when we spread two branes on a circle , they are in fact spread on a line ( which we will take to be the @xmath342 direction ) .",
    "we therefore preserve a larger symmetry group in this case , which includes an @xmath343 isometry group ( enlarged to @xmath344 due to the @xmath345 operation interchanging the two ns5-branes ) .",
    "we will use this extension of the symmetry group to make an interesting consistency check on our claims in previous sections . in the exact conformal field theory at @xmath346 ,",
    "the minimal model becomes trivial .",
    "the bulk theory and its symmetries were thoroughly analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we recall that at level @xmath109 we can fermionize the asymptotic angular variable @xmath347 in liouville theory by the equivalence @xmath348 .",
    "this allows us to define the @xmath349 affine currents : @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the fermionic partner of the angular variable @xmath347 and @xmath352 is the superpartner of the asymptotic radial direction @xmath353 . from the detailed arguments in @xcite ,",
    "one concludes that the bulk liouville deformation can be chosen such as to preserve a diagonal @xmath349 current algebra .",
    "it is this local symmetry algebra on the world - sheet that generates the @xmath343 isometry group in space - time ( in the doubly scaled regime ) .",
    "we wish to add non - compact branes to this configuration . in doing",
    "so we observe that there is a single non - compact d4-brane that we can add to the asymptotically flat configuration which will preserve the @xmath343 isometry group .",
    "it is the non - compact d4-brane that stretches along the line separating the @xmath354-branes ( namely the @xmath342 direction ) and coinciding with the ns5-branes in the transverse space @xmath355 . from the arguments in the previous section , we expect that that brane should correspond to the non - compact brane at @xmath356 after descending down the throat .",
    "we can test this directly in the full exact conformal field theory , using the symmetry algebra above . from the results of @xcite and @xcite",
    "it is clear that the three currents evaluated on the boundary correspond precisely to the two marginal f - term deformations and the marginal d - term deformation of boundary @xmath0 liouville theory .",
    "thus , the boundary deformations form a triplet of @xmath343 . consequently ,",
    "when any of these boundary deformations is turned on , we break @xmath343 .",
    "we already saw that the f - term boundary deformations are generically zero at @xmath356 ( see equation ( [ mua ] ) ) .",
    "so , to check whether @xmath343 is preserved we need to check whether also the third deformation parameter is zero .",
    "it has the value @xcite : @xmath357 we observe that precisely at the value @xmath346 , and @xmath295 the third boundary deformation parameter @xmath358 is zero as well . in summary , we used a particularly symmetric set - up to provide a powerful consistency check on our identification of the brane @xmath356 as the brane that splits on two ns5-branes .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated character identities for the @xmath0 superconformal algebra , which lead to the introduction of addition relations for boundary states .",
    "we then showed the appearance of localized bound states in the spectrum of non - compact branes , both via an analytic and an algebraic approach .",
    "these interesting properties of non - rational @xmath0 liouville theory find applications in string theory .",
    "we analyzed one application in detail , for branes in the background of ns5-branes spread on a circle .",
    "there we showed that the addition relations are reflected in semi - classical properties of d - branes with three directions transverse to the ns5-branes .",
    "we also gave an exact conformal field theory analysis of the spectrum on these branes , and showed the appearance of interesting open string bound states localized deep down the throat of ns5-branes ( in a triple scaling limit ) .",
    "we performed a preliminary analysis of the gauge theory interactions that govern these bound states at low energy .",
    "there remain many interesting open questions related to our work .",
    "we mention only a few interesting routes .",
    "the four - dimensional gauge theory we identified deserves more investigation .",
    "the computation of the interactions of the bound states at low energy would be a useful enterprise .",
    "it would also be interesting to apply what we have learned about @xmath0 liouville theory to configurations that preserve only four supercharges .",
    "another direction would be the construction of boundary states that do not factorize in terms of the coset conformal field theories , and find their interpretation in terms of d - branes in ns5-brane backgrounds .",
    "this is presumably related to the problem of giving a mass to the hyper multiplet living on the non - compact brane , while keeping the vector multiplet massless .",
    "we hope to return to some of these open problems in the near future .",
    "our work was supported in part by the eu under the contract mrtn - ct-2004 - 005104 .",
    "we would like to thank pierre fayet for a useful discussion .",
    "in this appendix we review the detailed construction of the full cardy states in @xmath0 liouville theory @xcite , including the couplings to the discrete ishibashi states .",
    "we also compute the annulus amplitudes for arbitrary discrete branes .",
    "we show that discrete characters appear in the open string channel with multiplicities that are generically not positive integers .",
    "we carefully normalize our amplitudes and one - point functions as follows .",
    "we fix the normalization of the continuous ishibashi states such that their overlap is @xmath359 .",
    "our convention for the normalization of the closed string momentum ( and therefore of the @xmath203-function ) is such that @xmath360 determines the casimir of an @xmath3 representation .",
