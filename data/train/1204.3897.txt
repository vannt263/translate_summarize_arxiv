    "recent studies have found that luminous infrared galaxies are preferentially forming stars at the outskirts of some massive clusters ( e.g. haines et al .",
    "2010 ) , suggesting that star - formation may be quenched within the central regions at these epochs .",
    "this star - formation and agn activity in high - redshift cluster galaxies should be fueled by significant reservoirs of molecular gas , and observations of this gas can provide insight into the processes governing galaxy formation in dense environments .",
    "the most effective means of studying the molecular gas in high - redshift galaxies is through observations of redshifted co line emission ( see reviews by solomon & vanden  bout 2005 ; carilli et al .",
    "2011a ) , as the luminosity in the lowest-_j _ co line transitions ( _ _ j__=2 - 1 or _ _",
    "j__=1 - 0 ) provide an estimate of the total mass in cold molecular gas .",
    "sensitive interferometric imaging of co line emission redshifted to mm and cm - wavelengths has been used to probe the molecular gas content of members of galaxy overdensities at redshifts , @xmath17 ( e.g. nesvadba et al .",
    "2009 ; riechers et al .  2010 ; carilli et al .",
    "these observations revealed that gas - rich galaxies do reside in proposed galaxy overdensities at high - redshift , presumably fueling starburst and agn activity in objects that are rapidly evolving toward massive galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "in the nearby universe , most early - type galaxies inhabiting rich clusters are gas - poor ( e.g. combes et al .",
    "2007 ) , as the cold gas has been consumed during star - formation , or removed through processes such as ram pressure stripping . at intermediate redshifts ,",

    "it is possible that such systems will consume their gas rapidly as they enter the cluster .",
    "however , these clusters are still at relatively low redshift , in the regime where we expect star formation activity to be suppressed in the harsh cluster environments .",
    "to date , there have been no studies of the cold molecular gas traced by redshifted co line emission in massive ( @xmath2010@xmath21  m@xmath3 ) galaxy clusters at @xmath22 .    the formation of massive galaxies at high - redshift is often traced by strong infrared emission , which probes an active phase of dust obscured star formation and agn activity , such as that seen in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) in the nearby universe .",
    "local and high redshift ulirgs are invariably observed to be rich in molecular gas which provides fuel for ongoing star formation activity ( solomon & vanden bout 2005 ) .",

    "<S> the optical spectrum of this object suggests that it is likely an obscured agn , and the measured co line luminosity is @xmath13  k  km  s@xmath7  pc@xmath8 , which leads to an estimated cold molecular gas mass @xmath14  m@xmath3 . </S>",
