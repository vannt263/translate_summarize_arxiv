    "the understanding of low - energy electronic structures and excitations in real materials is an important subject of condensed - matter physics and material science .",
    "interesting phenomena such as a non - fermi - liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity are caused by the instability of electronic structures near the fermi level .",
    "a common feature is often found in the band structures showing such phenomena ; isolated bands appear near the fermi level .",
    "the width of these isolated bands is typically the order of 1 ev , which is comparable to local electronic interactions .",
    "thus , in these isolated bands , the kinetic and potential energies compete with each other , and the competition is often discussed within a local - interaction approximation , as in the hubbard model . in real materials , however , there exist various elementally excitations not described by the local electronic interaction .",
    "the plasmon in metallic systems or the exciton in insulating systems are well known examples of such nonlocal excitations , which result from the long - range coulomb interaction . in the above - mentioned isolated - band systems",
    ", the plasmon excitation can occur in this band , and its energy scale can be very small ( of the order of 1 ev ) , which is comparable to the bandwidth and the size of the local coulomb interaction .    in this study , we investigate the effect of the low - energy - plasmon fluctuation on the electronic structure of real isolated - band systems from first principles . for this purpose",
    ", we choose two materials , a quasi - one dimensional organic conductor ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 ( ref .  ) , where tmtsf stands for tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene , and a three - dimensional perovskite transition - metal oxide srvo@xmath3 ( ref .  ) .",
    "these materials are typical isolated - band systems and are studied as benchmark materials of the correlated metal , where the local coulomb - interaction effect on the electronic properties is investigated with much interest .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we focus on the low - energy plasmon effect on the electronic structure .",
    "@xcite through the comparison between theoretical and experimental results on the plasmon - related properties and spectral functions , we verify low - energy plasmon effects on the electronic structure of the real system .    the organic conductor ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 is a representative quasi - one - dimensional material ,  @xcite and basically behaves as a good metallic conductor .",
    "@xcite at low temperature ( around 12 k ) , it undergoes a transition to a spin - density - wave phase .",
    "@xcite in the high - temperature metallic region , photoemission spectroscopy has observed small spectral weight near the fermi level .",
    "@xcite from this observation and the quasi - one - dimensional nature , the origin of the renormalization has been discussed in view of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , this material exhibits clear low - energy plasma edges around 0.1 - 1 ev in the reflectance spectra .",
    "@xcite therefore , this plasmon excitation would also be a prominent renormalization factor of the electronic structure .",
    "the transition - metal oxide srvo@xmath3 is another well known correlated metal .",
    "@xcite many high - resolution photoemission measurements  @xcite including the bulk - sensitive version  @xcite were performed and clarified a strong renormalization of the low - energy isolated band and the satellite peak just below this band .",
    "the origin has actively been discussed in terms of the local electronic correlation .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the reflectance and electron - energy - loss spectra have clarified low - energy plasmon excitations around 1.4 ev .",
    "@xcite in density - functional band structure , srvo@xmath3 has isolated bands of the @xmath4 orbitals around the fermi level , whose bandwidth is about 2.7 ev .",
    "@xcite also , the constrained random phase approximation gives an estimate of the local electronic interaction of @xmath52 - 3 ev .",
    "@xcite thus , the energy scale of the experimentally observed plasmon excitation is comparable to the bandwidth and the local coulomb interaction .",
    "hence , the low - energy plasmon fluctuation would certainly be relevant to the low - energy properties .    to study how the plasmon excitation affects the electronic structure , we perform _ ab initio _ calculations based on the @xmath0 approximation .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 calculation considers the self - energy effect due to the plasmon fluctuation and describes properly quasiparticle energies in the valence region . on the other hand ,",
    "the description for the plasmon satellite in the spectral function is known to be less accurate .",

    "@xmath0 plus cumulant ( @xmath0+@xmath6 ) calculations have recently been performed .",

    "<S> these materials exhibit characteristic low - energy band structures around the fermi level , which bring about interesting low - energy properties ; the low - energy bands near the fermi level are isolated from the other bands and , in the isolated bands , unusually low - energy plasmon excitations occur . to study the effect of this low - energy - plasmon fluctuation on the electronic structure , we calculate spectral functions and photoemission spectra using the _ ab initio _ cumulant expansion of the green s function based on the @xmath0 self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the low - energy plasmon fluctuation leads to an appreciable renormalization of the low - energy bands and a transfer of the spectral weight into the incoherent part , thus resulting in an agreement with experimental photoemission data . </S>"
