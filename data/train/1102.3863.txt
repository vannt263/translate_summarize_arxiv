    "we consider the non - minimal couplings of gravitational and electromagnetic fields described by a lagrangian density .",
    "such couplings may occur near compact astrophysical objects which has high mass density such as the neutron stars or black holes .",
    "the non - minimally coupled electromagnetic fields to gravity in @xmath2 form were extended and classified @xcite to gain more insight into the relationship between space - time curvature and charge conservation .",
    "they were also obtained from a calculation in qed of the photon effective action from 1-loop vacuum polarization on a curved background @xcite and from kaluza - klein reduction of a five - dimensional @xmath3-lagrangian @xcite . a non - minimally coupled einstein - maxwell lagrangian in general may involve field equations of order higher than two .",
    "however , the type of non - minimal couplings we consider are obtained by the reduction of the euler - poincar lagrangian in five dimensions to four dimensions and involve at most second order field equations @xcite .",
    "a three parameter family of non - minimally coupled einstein - maxwell field equations was studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , in the context of primordial magnetic fields present during the reheating epoch of the universe , the @xmath4-type couplings were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the modified gravity with @xmath5 terms @xcite has also got much attention , since it could explain the observed acceleration of the universe and the dark energy concept without using any exotic fields .",
    "the behavior of the rotational velocities of test particles gravitating around galaxies is investigated in modified gravity in the context of non - minimal matter couplings @xcite . in this context , the modified @xmath6-maxwell gravity with @xmath7 coupling terms @xcite and @xmath8-maxwell gravity in which non - minimal coupling between electromagnetic fields and a function of gauss - bonnet invariant @xcite were proposed to explain late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "there are many other theories of gravity with non - minimal couplings @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the non - minimal couplings with electromagnetic fields are not investigated in sufficient detail .",
    "especially , finding spherically symmetric solutions is not an easy task for such theories @xcite,@xcite .",
    "furthermore , any arbitrary non - minimal coupling may not give rise to solutions satisfying physical asymptotic conditions and observations in solar and cosmological scales .",
    "therefore , here we propose a non - minimal theory with a special @xmath5 coupling term .",
    "we first discuss a non - minimal @xmath9 coupled einstein - maxwell theory using the algebra of exterior differential forms .",
    "we derive the field equations by a first order variational principle using the method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "we choose in particular @xmath10 and look for static , spherically symmetric solutions that are asymptotically flat . in our model , the @xmath11",
    "coupled term in the lagrangian leads to modifications both in the maxwell and einstein field equations .",
    "the modifications in the maxwell equations can be related with the polarization and the magnetization in a specific medium .",
    "the non - minimal couplings also give important modifications to the structure of a charged black hole .",
    "these may shed light on some important problems of gravity such as dark matter and dark energy without introducing a cosmological constant or any other type of scalar fields .",
    "we will derive our field equations by a variational principle from an action @xmath12 = \\int_m{l } = \\int_m{\\mathcal{l}^*1 } ,          \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the fundamental gravitational field variables and @xmath15 is the electromagnetic field 2-form .",
    "the space - time metric @xmath16 with signature @xmath17 and we fix the orientation by setting @xmath18 .",
    "torsion 2-forms @xmath19 and curvature 2-forms @xmath20 of spacetime are found from the cartan - maurer structure equations @xmath21 @xmath22 we consider the following lagrangian density 4-form ; [ lag1 ] l = r*1 -y(r ) ff , [ lagrange ] where @xmath23 is newton s universal gravitational constant @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the curvature scalar which can be found by applying interior product @xmath26 twice to the curvature tensor @xmath27 2-form .",
    "we use the shorthand notation @xmath28 , and @xmath29   @xmath30 .",
    "the field equations are obtained by considering the independent variations of the action with respect to @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath31 .",
    "the electromagnetic field components are read from the expansion @xmath32 .",
    "we will confine ourselves to the unique metric - compatible , torsion - free levi - civita connection .",
    "we impose this choice of connection through the constrained variations of the action by the method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "that is , we add to the above lagrangian density the following constraint terms : @xmath33 where @xmath34 s are lagrange multiplier 2-forms whose variation imposes the zero - torsion constraint @xmath35 .",
    "we also use a first order variational principle for the electromagnetic field 2-form @xmath15 for which the homogeneous field equation @xmath36 is imposed by the variation of the lagrange multiplier 2-form @xmath37 .",
    "the infinitesimal variations of the total lagrangian density @xmath38 ( modulo a closed form ) are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and the angular momentum tensor @xmath41 .",

    "we have taken the source - free maxwell equations .",
    "the effects of gravitation and electromagnetism on matter are described by @xmath52 .",
    "we can complete this system writing the following linear constitutive relation g = ( f ) where @xmath53 is a type-(2,2)-constitutive tensor .",
    "for the above theory , we have g = y(r ) f .",
    "we can further introduce the polarization 1-form @xmath54 and magnetization 1-form @xmath55 relative to a time - like unit velocity vector field u of an inertial observer ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "now we consider the following function @xmath56 as a special case : y(r)= [ yr ] where @xmath57 is a dimensionless coupling constant and @xmath58 is a constant with the same dimension as that of r. we take @xmath59 to get back to the minimal einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "furthermore , if we look at the limit @xmath60 we again obtain the minimal einstein - maxwell case .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the limits as r goes either to zero or to infinity , the function @xmath61 .",
    "that is , the effects of gravity become important and the electromagnetic effects can be neglected in these limits . on the other hand ,",
    "as r approaches @xmath62 , @xmath63 becomes very large so that the electromagnetic effects dominate .",
    "finally , the function @xmath56 can be expanded as a power series in @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 as @xmath67 in this form the model resembles the rg improved theory proposed by bamba and odintsov in ref.@xcite . following this article",
    ", we try to relate the asymptotic freedom in a non - abelian su(2 ) gauge theory with a non - minimal maxwell - modified gravity by setting @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a renormalization - group parameter , @xmath70 is the running su(2 ) gauge coupling constant and @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath72 , we obtain a similar kind of the rg parameter which has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we seek static , spherically symmetric solutions to the field equations which are given by the metric @xmath73 and a static electric potential 1-form @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath75      after a lengthy calculation we reduce the non - minimally coupled einstein - maxwell equations ( [ einstein ] ) and ( [ maxwell1 ] ) for the metric ( [ metric ] ) and the electromagnetic 2-form ( [ electromagnetic ] ) to the following system of equations : @xmath76\\rq{}f   - \\frac{2}{r } f^2 ( e^2 y_r    ) \\rq{}=0 ,    \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\frac{1}{\\kappa^2}(\\frac{{f^2}\\rq{}}{r }   + \\frac{f^2 - 1 } { r^2 } ) -   y_r e^2 ( \\frac { { { f^2}\\rq{}}\\rq { } } { 2 } + \\frac{{f^2}\\rq { } } { r }   ) + \\frac{1}{2 } ye^2   - ( e^2   y_r ) \\rq { } ( \\frac{{f^2}\\rq{}}{2 } + \\frac{2 f^2}{r } ) = 0 , \\\\   & &    \\frac{1}{\\kappa^2}(\\frac { { { f^2}\\rq { } } \\rq { } } { 2 }   + \\frac{{f^2}\\rq{}}{r } ) - y_r e^2 ( \\frac {   { { f^2}\\rq { } } } { r } + \\frac{{f^2 - 1 } } { r^2 }   ) - \\frac{1}{2 } ye^2    - [ ( e^2   y_r ) \\rq { } f]\\rq{}f   - ( e^2   y_r ) \\rq { } ( \\frac{{f^2}\\rq{}}{2 } + \\frac{f^2}{r } ) = 0 , \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath77 here the curvature scalar @xmath78 q is the electric charge determined by the gauss integral @xmath79      at this point , we will make a simplifying assumption and consider solutions that satisfy @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant to be fixed .",
    "then , the field equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) simplify to @xmath82 thus , for @xmath83 , we can solve the unknown functions for the non - minimally extended einstein - maxwell theory with @xmath84 and find @xmath85 @xmath86 is an integration constant satisfying the relation @xmath87 .",
    "the above solution is asymptotically flat .",
    "it is interesting to note that the electric field changes sign ( due to polarization effects ) at @xmath88 that corresponds to the value @xmath89 . on the other hand ,",
    "the displacement vector field is an inverse square force field and hence does not change sign .",
    "we observe that both the curvature scalar and the quadratic curvature invariant @xmath90 for our solutiuon are singular at the origin @xmath91 .",
    "the roots of the metric function @xmath92 are determined by the intersection points of a logarithmic curve and a parabola . in order to find these points we look at the numerator of the metric function : @xmath93 the derivative of the function or @xmath94 has two local extrema at @xmath95 we find the number of event horizons depending on the critical values of the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath86 by looking at the behavior of the derivative of the above expression ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath94 has one root ( @xmath97 ) for @xmath98 , two roots for @xmath99 , one root for @xmath100 , ( @xmath101 ) and no roots for @xmath102 .",
    "the number of the horizons will differ according to the sign of the function @xmath103 at these critical points and the values of @xmath1 and @xmath86 .",
    "we will determine these intervals and plot the graphs of the function @xmath103 in the interval for certain values of the parameters as follows .",
    "+ [ fig - f(r ) ]    case a : :    for @xmath104 , we can determine the interval of    @xmath86 related with the numbers of horizons from the    following inequalities ( for a specific case see fig.1 ) ;    +    1 .",
    "if @xmath105 , there are two horizons .    2 .",
    "if @xmath106 , there is one horizon .    3 .",
    "if @xmath107 , there is no horizon .",

    "3 .   if i ) @xmath105 and @xmath112 or     ii ) @xmath107 and @xmath114 there are    three horizons .",
    "but it is not possible to find an @xmath86 in    the second interval @xmath107 and    @xmath114 .",

    "the case with no horizon exhibits a naked singularity .",
    "the cases with a single horizon resemble the extreme reissner - nordstrm solution , while the cases with two horizons correspond to the the generic reissner - nordstrm geometry .",
    "the case with three horizons seems to be new .",
    "further investigation of the black hole properties can be done numerically for each of the cases above .",
    "we plan to deal with this problem in a future work .",
    "we considered a non - minimally @xmath9-coupled einstein - maxwell theory and looked for static , spherically symmetric solutions for a specific function @xmath119 that shows charge screening effects .",
    "we obtained a class of asymptotically flat solutions that include new black hole candidate configurations , except for the parameter values @xmath120 and @xmath121 when there is a naked essential singularity at the origin .",
    "these particular solutions may shed light on some problems of gravity such as dark matter and dark energy without introducing a cosmological constant or any other exotic fields .",
    "this means that , if dark matter is not some strange matter , but , for instance the non - minimal couplings produce such effects @xcite ; then the electromagnetic potentials get modified at large ( astrophysical ) scales and thus contribute to the conventional electromagnetic energy density which may then be interpreted as the effects of dark matter .",
    "we also note that the electric charge q need not have a large value to have observable effects . if q is small , @xmath1 may be large so that the product @xmath122 becomes important at large ( astrophysical ) scales .",
    "this can explain the rotation curves of galaxies for certain parameter values @xcite .",
