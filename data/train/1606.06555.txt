    "we provide additional details and results for the travelling polymerase model presented in the main text .",
    "we also discuss some variants of the model , including one in which polymerases are static .",
    "we also present some analytical results , mainly obtained within the simpler static polymerase model .",
    "the diffusive equation of motion for the supercoiling density , eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the main text , can be motivated as follows .",
    "first , a good approximation for the free energy density of a supercoiled dna with degree of supercoiling @xmath27 is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a positive constant with appropriate dimensions  @xcite . in a dna loop , or in a dna region",
    "where the ends are fixed , or not free to rotate , the overall degree of supercoiling is fixed , therefore the appropriate dynamics for @xmath19 is that of model b  @xcite , @xmath91 where @xmath18 is the 1d position along the dna , @xmath92 is the mobility associated to the supercoiling density and @xmath93 is time .",
    "the term @xmath94 is the analogue of the chemical potential in the `` standard '' model b dynamics ( i.e. , for binary mixtures  @xcite . as discussed in the text , eq .",
    "( [ supercoileqdiff ] ) means that the local degree of supercoiling diffuses , with effective diffusion coefficient @xmath95 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ freeenergy ] ) only holds for relatively small values of @xmath27  @xcite . it would be possible , in principle , to improve this by choosing a free energy functional which better captures the free energy cost of supercoiling beyond the harmonic approximation",
    "however , there are other aspects of the continuum model which break down for large @xmath27 ; e.g. , when the local supercoiling density becomes too negative , the polymerase would no longer indefinitely increase its affinity for the promoter , or when @xmath27 is close to -1 , so that the linking number of the dna is close to 0 , we would no longer expect transcription to create positive or negative supercoiling .",
    "therefore , we feel it better to maintain the harmonic approximation which makes the model simpler , keeping in mind the caveat that it will break down for large values of supercoiling ( say , @xmath96 ) .    it is useful here to make a few other technical remarks on the model .",
    "first , the supercoiling flux associated with transcription is proportional to a dirac delta function ( see eq .  ( 1 ) of the main text ) . since in reality",
    "a polymerase will have a finite footprint on the dna , the dirac delta function can also be substituted with its regularised representation , @xmath97/(2l\\sqrt{\\pi})},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the argument of the dirac delta function and @xmath98 is the regularised support of the flux . in the simulations for figs . 2 - 4 in the main text ( and also for figs .",
    "s1-s6 below ) , the dirac delta is substituted by a kronecker delta @xmath99 , hence regularisation occurs with @xmath100 , the lattice spacing , which physically should be the size of a polymerase ( @xmath10115 bp ) . in fig . 1 in the main text we used the regularised delta of eq .  ( [ regularisation ] ) , with @xmath102 .",
    "second , while the baseline model considers the case where the overall supercoiling integrates to 0 , having an average non - zero supercoiling , @xmath103 would not affect the results ( provided that the dependence on @xmath10 is on @xmath104 ) .",
    "third , in the baseline model , a polymerase can engage on a gene as soon as its promoter is empty , i.e. , when the previous polymerase has moved a single lattice spacing . in practice",
    ", a polymerase may need to be further away from the promoter before a second can initiate another transcription event .",
    "we have performed additional simulations , which suggests that while this fact quantitatively changes the overall transcription rate for a given value of the supercoiling flux , @xmath53 , the qualitative trends reported in the main text are preserved .",
    "fourth , in the travelling polymerase model reported in the main text the transcription flux increases during transcription to model the fact that the positive supercoiling is racked up in front of the travelling polymerase .",
    "a constant @xmath105 would not capture the asymmetry between the higher positive supercoiling peak in front of the polymerase and the smaller negative supercoiling wake behind ; we have seen that it would , however , lead to qualitatively similar physics .",
    "finally , when describing the model we imagine that the polymerase moves along the dna .",
    "however , a similar level of torsional stress arises if the polymerase is immobilised and the dna is reeled in to be transcribed  @xcite .    in the main text ,",
    "the switch between the relaxed regime and the supercoiling - regulated regime is described in terms of some information theory quantities  @xcite , the conditional entropy and the mutual information , which we define mathematically here .",
    "these quantities are both defined in terms of a time series , here the sequence of the gene number transcribed over time , @xmath106 , where e.g. @xmath107 is the index of the gene activated during the first transcription event , @xmath108 is that activated during the second etc .",
    "the `` conditional entropy '' of the transcription time series is defined as @xmath109},\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the joint probability of observing the transcription of gene @xmath24 followed by that of @xmath111 as consecutive events , while @xmath112 is the conditional probability of gene @xmath24 being the next transcribed gene given that @xmath111 was the last to be transcribed . note that in general @xmath113 ( this is essentially due to the system being away from equilibrium ) .",
    "the conditional entropy @xmath114 is maximal , and equal to @xmath57 , if the transcription dynamics is a poisson process , as is the case when @xmath59 ; it is instead equal to 0 in the limit of a maximally correlated process , for instance when a single gene is repeatedly transcribed .",
    "the `` mutual information '' of the series of transcription events is defined as @xmath115},\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the overall probability that gene @xmath24 is activated .",
    "the mutual information is equal to 0 if @xmath117 , i.e. for a succession of randomly chosen genes ; its value therefore measures the divergence of the joint probability distribution for successive transcription events from that of a random process . in statistical mechanics systems",
    "it is often found that the mutual information peaks at or close to phase transitions  @xcite , where correlations are maximal ( however the definition of mutual information for thermodynamic systems is different  @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we provide additional figures regarding the travelling polymerase model : these give more details and also demonstrate that the results shown in the main text are not qualitatively affected by different parameter choices .",
    "s1 shows a plot of the mutual information for the case of genes with the same direction , as a function of @xmath35 ( same parameters and gene positions as in fig . 2 of the main text )",
    ": there is a shoulder accompanying the crossover between the uniform and the supercoiling - regulated regime .",
    "s2 shows the transcription rate per gene as a function of @xmath35 for the case of a single gene and a single polymerase ( red curve ) .",
    "the curves are scaled by the transcription rate at @xmath65 .",
    "the single gene system can exhibit transcription bursts , but not waves , yet the overall transcription rate is similar to the overall transcription rate per gene in the case of genes oriented in the same direction ( green curve , same data as in fig .",
    "2d ) .    for concreteness and simplicity , in the text",
    "we have chosen to vary only @xmath105 ( hence @xmath53 ) , keeping other parameters constant ( our parameter choice is relevant to bacterial dna ) .",
    "this is sufficient because , as the supercoiling flux changes , this varies all three dimensionless parameters identified in the main text:@xmath118 , @xmath76 and @xmath119 .",
    "however , it is also of interest to examine the quantitative effect of other parameters .",
    "therefore in fig .",
    "s3 we show the effect of varying @xmath105 ( hence @xmath53 ) when a different choice of the parameter @xmath30 , the baseline polymerase binding rate , is used .",
    "we show both the transcription rate ( fig .",
    "s3a , scaled this time so that the value of 1 corresponds to all genes being constantly transcribed ) and the mutual information ( fig .",
    "s3b ) for the parallel array of genes in fig .",
    "2 , where the value of the baseline polymerase binding rate without supercoiling , @xmath30 , is varied by two orders of magnitude .    fig .",
    "s3a shows that in all cases there is a crossover between a uniform regime and one where supercoiling upregulates transcription .",
    "indeed , the curves show a similar crossover point when they are plotted as a function of @xmath120  this scaling makes sense qualitatively since if genes are active less often ( which is the case for smaller @xmath121 ) , then one expects that a larger flux is needed to enhance the transcription rate by a significant amount . below we shall present a mean field theory which further motivates theoretically this scaling",
    "the main effect of changing @xmath30 is that the crossover becomes sharper as @xmath30 decreases  again , our mean field theory will provide an explanation for this observation .",
    "s3b shows that the mutual information attains a similar value in the supercoiling - mediated regime , whereas the peak corresponding broadly to the crossover point is more visible for small @xmath30 : again , this indicates that the crossover is sharper in that case . for the parameter range investigated , we further always find transcription waves in the supercoiling - regulated regime : these waves persist down to smaller values of @xmath120 for small @xmath30 .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "s4 shows the transcription probability for different runs in the case of randomly oriented genes ( positions as in fig . 3 in the main text ) :",
    "the histograms show that in different runs , different gene pairs are upregulated .",
    "the system therefore shows multistability : once a gene pair is chosen , transcription is localised there for a long time ( often for the whole run ) .     for the transcription dynamics in fig . 2 of the main text ( averaged over 7 runs )",
    "]     for a model with only one gene ( @xmath122 ; other parameters as in fig . 2 of the main text ) and for the case of genes oriented in the same direction ( see fig . 2 of the main text ) .",
    "the overall transcription rate is normalised with the expected value at @xmath65 in both cases : the behaviour is very similar in the two cases . ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this section we obtain some exact results and scaling relations ; we will work within the static polymerase model , but in the next section we will also apply them to the travelling polymerase model .",
    "we begin by considering the static polymerase model , where there is a single gene .",
    "we start from the equation for @xmath19 , and imagine that the gene is on : @xmath123,\\ ] ] where we use the boundary condition that @xmath124 , and consider no flux boundaries ( so that the overall supercoiling is fixed ; we solve the equations on an infinite domain , so this implies @xmath125 at @xmath126 ) . in steady state ( @xmath127 ) , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ supercoilingeq1 ] ) is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the sign function , so @xmath130 for positive @xmath18 , and @xmath131 for negative @xmath18 .",
    "this solution shows that the typical value of the supercoiling density is @xmath132 ( however it is only accurate for a gene which is always on ) .",
    "it is also of interest to examine how the solution evolves in time to yield eq .",
    "( [ solution1 ] ) at steady state . to address this",
    ", we consider an initial condition with @xmath133 , and we imagine that the gene is switched on at time @xmath51 .",
    "then , while the gene is switched on , the laplace transform of @xmath19 , which we shall call @xmath134 , with @xmath135 satisfies the following equation @xmath136 where @xmath137 represents the derivative of the dirac delta function .    one way to solve eq .",
    "( [ supercoilingeq2 ] ) is to observe that the green s function , i.e. the solution of @xmath138 which decays to 0 at @xmath139 , is given by @xmath140 then , the solution of eq .",

    "this solution tends to eq .",
    "( [ solution1 ] ) when @xmath144 ; it also shows that , while the gene is on , again the typical value of supercoiling density _ in the neighbourhood of the promoter _ is @xmath145 .",
    "after the gene is switched off the supercoiling density satisfies the diffusion equation , @xmath146 with the initial condition that @xmath147 is as given by eq .",
    "( [ supercoilingeq3 ] ) . the solution can be written as @xmath148}{\\sqrt{4\\pi dt}}\\frac{j_0}{2d}{\\rm erfc}\\left(\\frac{|x'|}{2\\sqrt{d\\tau}}\\right){\\rm sgn}(x'),\\ ] ] where for simplicity we have shifted time so that the gene switches off at time @xmath51 and the solution holds for @xmath149 .",
    "( [ supercoilingeq5 ] ) can be used to infer that @xmath150 ( for the static polymerase model ) , and @xmath151 for large @xmath93 and for @xmath152 .",
    "we now use the results obtained from the last section to build a simple mean field theory for our model .",
    "we start from the observation that , within the static polymerase model , the on rate for rna polymerase , @xmath10 , depends on the extent of negative supercoiling upstream of the promoter ( at @xmath153 ) , according to the formula ( see main text and eq .",
    "( [ konstatic ] ) ) , @xmath154,\\ ] ] where , since this is always positive , we do not need the @xmath155 function as in the main text .",
    "we propose a simple mean field theory , where the value of @xmath156 is replaced with the average supercoiling profile over the whole simulation , @xmath157 .",
    "an equation for @xmath158 can be written down by finding the steady state solution of eq .",
    "( [ supercoilingeq1 ] ) when the flux is replaced by its average @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the fraction of time that the gene is on ( this last formula can be obtained by realising that the polymerase has an on rate equal to @xmath10 and an effective off rate equal to @xmath161 ) .",
    "if we do this , we find that @xmath162 we should note that this solution , as the previous ones , works for open , no flux , boundary conditions ( our simulations instead have periodic boundary conditions , but the scaling of @xmath158 does not change ) .",
    "we can now plug in this expression for @xmath158 in eq .",
    "( [ kon ] ) , to get a self - consistent equation , similar in spirit to a mean field theory , @xmath163 \\sim k_0\\left[1+\\alpha \\frac{k_{\\rm on}\\tau}{k_{\\rm on}\\tau + 1}\\frac{j_0}{2d}\\right].\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ kon2 ] ) has a solution which depends smoothly on @xmath164 : in other words , there should be no discontinuity in the transcription rate ( proportional to @xmath10 , see below ) as a function of @xmath105 . another way to understand",
    "this is to realise that eq .",
    "( [ kon2 ] ) is essentially equivalent to the mean field equation for the magnetisation versus temperature in the ising model in the presence of a non - zero magnetic field ( the @xmath30 term ) : it is well known that this equation in this case describes a smooth crossover and no thermodynamic phase transition .    while we have derived our mean field equation , eqs.([solution2 ] ) and  ( [ kon2 ] ) for the static polymerase model , numerically we found that eq .",
    "( [ solution2 ] ) also applies well for the travelling polymerase model , with @xmath105 replaced by @xmath53 , the average supercoiling flux during transcription .",
    "specifically , for the travelling polymerase model , the average supercoiling density at the promoter , which we call @xmath165 , is given by @xmath166 where @xmath167 is one of the dimensionless numbers introduced in the main text , for @xmath122 .",
    "( [ solution3 ] ) is used in the main text to estimate the supercoiling densities at promoters in bacteria , yeast and human cells .    by plugging eq .",
    "( [ solution3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ kon ] ) , we can find an explicit expression for @xmath10 in our mean field theory , which is given by @xmath168 the overall transcription rate @xmath169 ( of the single gene considered up to now in the simplified theory ) can be estimated as follows , @xmath170 where the correction @xmath171 takes into account the fact that the maximum transcription yield per gene is equal to @xmath161 , when the polymerase is transcribing the gene at all times .",
    "s7 shows some examples of the overall transcription rate @xmath169 , for different values of @xmath121 .",
    "as anticipated when analysing the static polymerase model , for any @xmath172 , there is no discontinuity in the transcription rate , so that the switch between uniform and supercoiling - regulated regime is a crossover . the only limit in which this would become a true nonequilibrium transition is if @xmath173 , while keeping the product @xmath174 constant .",
    "( [ solution4 ] ) and  ( [ transcriptionrate ] ) also highlight a useful criterion to determine when supercoiling starts to significantly affect transcriptional rate ( hence transcription ) : this occurs when @xmath175 in other words , the value of @xmath118 ( which is the parameter varied in the main text ) at which we should expect the crossover between the uniform and the supercoiling - dominated regime is equal to @xmath176 .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) also motivates the scaling used in fig . s3 .",
    "note that , as is the case in general for mean field approximations , the assumption that @xmath10 depends on the _ average _ supercoiling profile , @xmath158 , is only appropriate when the supercoiling profile does not vary too much in time , so that the instantaneous profile for @xmath27 is close to the average one .",
    "this is the case when there is not enough time for the supercoiling to diffuse away in between transcription events .",
    "the physical dimensionless parameter determining when this is the case , in the travelling polymerase model , is @xmath177 . if @xmath76 is small , then diffusion is fast and while the gene is off the supercoiling is much smaller than the average value , and our mean field theory is not valid .    fortunately , even when @xmath76 is relatively small ( fig .",
    "s8 , where the minimum value of @xmath76 is @xmath1010.44 ) our numerical results suggest that the value of @xmath27 at the promoter , @xmath60 , at the moment when the gene is switched on ( which is the relevant value to use in eq .",
    "( [ kon ] ) ) , depends on @xmath10 linearly for small @xmath10 , so that the same qualitative considerations apply as in our simplified mean field theory ( i.e. , the system displays a crossover rather than a phase transition as @xmath35 is increased ) .",
    "we can further perform a simulation to find the value of @xmath60 as a function of @xmath10 ( kept constant for each simulation , see fig . s8 and its caption ) .",
    "we can then fit the resulting data with the following functional form , @xmath178 and @xmath179 are positive constants determined via fitting ( see fig .",
    "s8 ) . at this point",
    ", we can follow the procedure described above , where eq .",

    "<S> we propose a stochastic model for gene transcription coupled to dna supercoiling , where we incorporate the experimental observation that polymerases create supercoiling as they unwind the dna helix , and that these enzymes bind more favourably to regions where the genome is unwound . within this model , we show that when the transcriptionally induced flux of supercoiling increases , there is a sharp crossover from a regime where torsional stresses relax quickly and gene transcription is random , to one where gene expression is highly correlated and tightly regulated by supercoiling . in the latter regime , </S>",
    "<S> the model displays transcriptional bursts , waves of supercoiling , and up - regulation of divergent or bidirectional genes . </S>",
    "<S> it also predicts that topological enzymes which relax twist and writhe should provide a pathway to down - regulate transcription . </S>",

    "<S> _    the dynamics of transcription is a topic of paramount importance in cell biology and biophysics . </S>",
    "<S> it underpins the expression and regulation of genes , which is crucial to the development and function of all living organisms  @xcite . to initiate transcription of a gene , cells rely on the binding of proteins such as polymerases and transcription factors , to the promoter  a dna region shortly upstream of the gene  @xcite . as there are a finite number of copies of such proteins present within a cell , this process is inherently stochastic  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we introduce a stochastic model of gene expression , which is fundamentally different from previous studies as it couples transcription to the dynamics of dna twist and supercoiling . </S>",
    "<S> supercoiling is a topological property of dna , arising from its chiral nature  @xcite . for b - dna in its relaxed state , </S>",
    "<S> the two strands of the molecule wind around each other once approximately every 10 base pairs ( bp ) , forming a right - handed double helix  @xcite . twisting dna away from this relaxed state , so as to over or under - wind the double helix , introduces positive or negative supercoiling respectively ; if large enough , this torsional strain can lead to writhing , or to dna melting . </S>",
    "<S> supercoiling thus refers to the difference in the linking number of the two dna strands , @xmath0 , with respect to that in the relaxed state , @xmath1 ; the global @xmath0 is a topological invariant if the dna is a loop or its ends are constrained  @xcite , whereas it can vary for an open polymer whose ends can rotate .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several observations which strongly suggest that dna supercoiling is intimately related to transcription , and that it can regulate gene expression . </S>",
    "<S> first , the `` twin supercoiled domain '' model  @xcite is based on the long - standing theoretical observation that if rotation of the rna polymerase and its associated transcription machinery is hindered , as is likely in the crowded intracellular environment , then gene transcription leads to the creation of positive supercoiling ahead of the tracking polymerase , and negative supercoiling in its wake . </S>",
    "<S> for every 10  bp or so which are transcribed , the linking number changes by @xmath2 ahead of the polymerase and by @xmath3 behind it . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have quantified supercoiling by measuring the dna binding affinity of psoralen , a chemical which intercalates preferentially where the double helix is under - wound  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these studies have shown that human chromosomes are organised into a set of supercoiling domains , whose structure is dramatically altered by inhibiting transcription .    </S>",
    "<S> our model is based on these observations , and incorporates the dynamics of supercoiling into a stochastic description of gene regulation . </S>",
    "<S> it exhibits a switch between two regimes : one where gene expression is random , and one where it is tightly regulated by supercoiling . within our framework </S>",
    "<S> , this switch is triggered , e.g. , by increasing the amount of supercoiling injected during each transcription event . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics in the supercoiling - regulated regime help explain a number of experimental observations , such as the existence of transcriptional bursts and the abundance of bidirectional genes in the genomes of many organisms .    </S>",
    "<S> we model the dna as a 1d lattice with spacing @xmath4 bp , the size of an rna polymerase  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dna contains @xmath5 genes , each of size @xmath6 , whose promoters are located at positions @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) on the dna </S>",

    "<S> it also regulates gene expression , promoting the transcription of genes which have a larger gap separating them from their upstream neighbours . </S>",
    "<S> when considering genes with random orientations , transcription localises at divergent gene pairs , which are highly up - regulated . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the observation that in yeast divergent gene pairs are often highly expressed essential genes  @xcite , and may explain the statistically surprising abundance of bidirectional promoters within mammals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our theory predicts that including the action of topoisomerases , which locally relax supercoiling , down - regulates transcription : this agrees with the observation that inhibiting topo i can boost eukaryotic transcription rates _ in vivo _  @xcite . note that we disregard other important topological enzymes , such as the bacterial gyrase , whose role is to introduce , rather than to relax , negative supercoiling : such enzymes are known to promote transcriptional bursting  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> first , we hope that our study will stimulate quantitative experiments measuring gene expression _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> , where gene positions and directions can be controlled , e.g. , via dna editing . </S>",
    "<S> second , the model could be refined by comparison with high resolution psoralen data on supercoiling domains in both pro- and eukaryotes . finally , it would be of interest to couple the dynamics of supercoiling to that of nucleosomes , which can at the same time create a barrier for supercoil diffusion , and localise twist and writhe .    </S>",
