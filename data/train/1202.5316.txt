    "gravitational lensing can be used to discover planets ( mao & paczynski 1991 ; gould & loeb 1992 ; bolatto & falco 1994 ; distefano & scalzo 1999a,1999b ; distefano & night 2008 ; distefano 2011 ) .",
    "the selection effects are very different from those associated with other planet - search techniques .",
    "lensing can therefore complement other techniques , including radial - velocity , transit , astrometric , and direct imaging studies .",
    "furthermore , although lensing has been considered as a method that primarily discovers distant planets , we now know that it can be effective in finding planets around nearby stars as well ( distefano 2008a , 2008b , distefano & night 2008 ; distefano 2011 ) .",
    "nearby lenses are referred to as mesolenses .",
    "the einstein angles and proper motions tend to be larger than typical for microlenses , producing a larger probability that a nearby system will serve as a lens , and also opening up new modes of observational study .",
    "for example , if one can extrapolate the trajectory of a nearby star , then mesolensing can be predicted in advance based on the proximity of background sources along the path .",
    "monitoring campaigns of a type we will describe here can thus be initiated to learn more about the lens star and to explore its planetary system .",
    "recently , the first prediction of a mesolensing event was made ( lpine & distefano 2011 ) . the event will occur when the high proper motion star vb  10 moves in front of a dim background star . in this paper",
    "we explicitly consider the full range of lensing signatures possible if vb  10 has planets .",
    "as it happens , it is likely to be challenging to observe the stellar - lens event in the vb  10 system ( please see the discussion below ) .",
    "the complete analysis we conduct , however , determines what types of observations can help us to learn about vb  10 s planets , should they exist .",
    "more than that , we have developed a plan that can be applied to future predicted events .",
    "vb  10 is a dwarf star , discovered by van  biesbroeck ( 1944 ) .",
    "it is particularly intriguing because its mass is estimated to be @xmath3 right on the boundary separating brown dwarfs from stars .",
    "vb  10 is nearby , only @xmath4  pc away , and has a proper motion of @xmath5  yr@xmath6 .",
    "because it lies in a dense region of the sky , vb  10 has a good chance of passing near a background star . for close - enough passages to a distant star , vb  10",
    ", whose einstein ring has an angular radius of @xmath7  milliarcseconds ( mas ) , will serve as a gravitational lens , producing events that can be detected through an increase in light received from the background star and/or through a detectable shift in its position .",
    "one such event is likely to occur in the near future .",
    "the lensing of the background star [ vb  10]-pmls-1 ( _ predicted mesolensing event-1 _ ; lpine & distefano 2011 ) by vb  10 , most likely to have occurred or to occur late in 2011 or early in 2012 , may turn out to be difficult to detect .",
    "the circumstances that make it challenging to detect the stellar - lens event are discussed in lpine & distefano 2011 .",
    "we briefly recap them below .",
    "if , however , the event can be detected and its time - scale can be measured , it will allow us to determine the gravitational mass of vb  10 , providing a unique and important data point in the stellar - mass function .",
    "we do not know whether vb  10 has planets , but if it does , they may produce lensing signatures that can be more readily detected .",
    "it is worthwhile summarizing the reasons why the vb  10 stellar - lens event is particularly challenging .",
    "part of the reason is due to the short notice for the event . with longer notice , more high - resolution images of the area prior to the closest passage",
    "would have allowed the distance and time of closest approach to be better estimated .",
    "as it is , we have a wide window of times and distances of closest approach ( figures 1 and 2 ) , making it difficult to plan an observing program that is well tailored to this specific event .",
    "this can be corrected for future event predictions by conducting systematic searches for possible lens / source pairs .",
    "this will allow high - resolution images of the region to help us refine the predictions .",
    "part of the reason that the vb  10 event is challenging , however , is beyond human control .",
    "for example , the background star is dim ( about 21 in b ) . even in b , vb  10",
    "is roughly @xmath8 times brighter .",
    "the combination of the dimness of the background star and the brightness of the foreground star limits the ability of many observers to measure small magnifications of the background star .",
    "furthermore , the best estimate of the time of closest approach is during the winter of @xmath9 during this interval vb  10 is so close to the sun that it is difficult to observe from the ground , in fact impossible to observe with some large telescopes , and is in the zone of avoidance for hst .",
    "if , however , event prediction can be accomplished on a regular basis , we should be able to identify lens / source pairs that are better suited to lensing studies .",
    "we therefore use the vb  10 event as an example to show what can be learned from monitoring the site of a predicted lensing event .",
    "this paper is devoted to computing and illustrating the effects observers can hope to discover if vb  10 has planets .",
    "an important feature of this work is that , if the background star is monitored several times per day over the next several months , we will either find evidence of planets , or else will place weak , but quantifiable limits on the existence of planets over a wide range of orbital separations .",
    "thus , even with the challenging circumstances described above , it is still worthwhile to monitor the region , although perhaps not as intensively as we would were the event more ideal . in fact",
    ", we will be able to derive weak limits on wide - orbit planets around vb  10 , even if no discoveries are made .",
    "of course if planets are discovered , this would be important .",
    "whatever the results for vb  10 , monitoring this system is an important step in preparing for future predictions of events that are more ideal .",
    "the structure of this paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we provide the necessary background .",
    "the lensing signatures are most directly tied to the projected distance between vb  10 and any planets it may harbor , and to the distance of closest approach . for any distance of closest approach , there is a chance that wide - orbit planets can be detected . some detections may occur weeks or months before or after the stellar - lens event .",
    "we consider the detection of wide - orbit planets in  3 .    for approaches of intermediate distance , within about @xmath10  einstein angles ( @xmath11  mas for vb  10 ) , close - orbit planets can be detected through small but quasiperiodic signatures that may occur days before and after the stellar - lens event , and also near the time of closest passage .",
    "we discuss the regime of close - orbit planets in  4 . for approaches within about @xmath12  einstein angles ( @xmath13  mas for vb  10 ) , planets in the so - called `` zone for resonant lensing '' can significantly increase the magnification , making the stellar - lens event easier to detect while simultaneously providing evidence for planets .",
    "we devote  5 to studying the signatures expected if vb  10 has planets in the zone for resonant lensing and if the approach is close enough to allow them to be detected .",
    "the relative sizes of the regions within which lensing effects associated with each regime may be detected are shown in figure 1 , which also shows a set of possible paths of vb  10 .",
    "we conclude in  6 with an overview of how observations before , during , and after a close approach can reveal the properties of a planetary system associated with the lens star .",
    "the next step is to design observing programs that take advantage of this theoretical work .",
    "this is the task of the companion paper ( distefano et al .",
    "2012 , hereafter referred to as paper ii ) .",
    "in paper ii we give an overview of the observational approach we can use to study vb  10 during the weeks and months around the time of its close approach to the background star [ vb  10]-pmls-1 .",
    "we expect vb  10 to be the first of a continuing line of predicted events .",
    "we therefore discuss the philosophy and methods of event prediction and the implications for the discovery and study of planetary systems .",
    "in this subsection we briefly sketch how the lens mass can be measured and binary and planet models can be tested .",
    "key concepts are the einstein angle @xmath14 and the einstein - diameter crossing time , @xmath15 the einstein angle is defined to be the angular radius of the ring that would form the image of the source , were the source , lens , and observer to be perfectly aligned . in the absence of perfect alignment , a point lens produces two images .",
    "if @xmath16 is the mass of the lens , @xmath17 is the distance to the lens , and @xmath18 is the distance to the lensed source , then @xmath19^\\frac{1}{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the mass of the lens and @xmath21 in the plane of the source lensed by vb  10 , this angle subtends a distance larger than @xmath22 assuming @xmath23  kpc .",
    "this suggests that finite - source - size effects are negligible , even if the substructures leading to planet - lens effects have sizes that are as small as @xmath24 of the einstein ring .",
    "several things are noteworthy about equation 1 .",
    "first , the value of @xmath14 depends only on the lens mass and on @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath17 is potentially measurable for a nearby star ; we have , for example , a high - precision measurement of the distance to vb  10 .",
    "the value of @xmath18 may not be known exactly , but the uncertainty in @xmath25 is roughly @xmath26 which can be small , since @xmath27 is typically small .",
    "if , e.g. , the distance to [ vb  10]-pmls-1 is a kpc , the uncertainty in @xmath25 is approximately @xmath28 if , therefore , we can measure the value of @xmath14 , then we can measure the lens mass .",
    "the value of @xmath14 can be measured in two ways .",
    "the first is by fitting a lensing model to the light curve .",
    "a unique value of the magnification is associated with each value of the angular separation between the source and lens , @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath29 is expressed in units of @xmath30 then the fractional magnification , @xmath31 is roughly @xmath32 for @xmath33 @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 the magnification falls off as @xmath38 .",
    "a lensing model fit allows us to derive the value of the einstein diameter crossing time , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the proper motion .",
    "the value of @xmath40 can be measured for nearby stars , as it has been for vb  10 . with @xmath41 measured from the light curve , the value of @xmath14 can be determined .",
    "second , lensing produces an astrometric shift in the position of the lensed source .",
    "the value of @xmath14 can be measured by measuring the shift in the light centroid .",
    "the maximum value of the apparent shift in the source position occurs when the source and lens are separated by about @xmath30 and the size of the shift is roughly equal to @xmath42 the centroid shift falls off as @xmath43 thus , in the case of vb  10 , the size of the einstein angle is large enough that it can potentially be measured with high resolution images from _ hst _ or using adaptive optics from ground - based telescopes , such as keck",
    ".    the duration of detectable lensing signatures can be significantly longer than @xmath41 , which , for the vb  10 event is @xmath44  days ( the exact value is dependent on the proper motion of the background star ) .",
    "if magnification effects of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) are detectable , then the duration of detectable deviations from baseline can be as long as @xmath47  days ( @xmath48  days )",
    ". the duration of detectable astrometric effects can be even longer , depending on the sensitivity of the measurements .",
    "the detectability of both astrometric and photometric effects is complicated by the blending of light from the lensed source with light from other stars along the line of sight . in the case of lensing by vb  10 ,",
    "most of the additional light emanates from the lens itself .",
    "the source to be lensed , [ vb  10]-pmls-1 , is a dim star . because it is bluer than vb  10 , changes in light from [ vb  10]-pmls-1 caused by vb  10 will be most detectable at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we have estimated the magnitudes of [ vb  10]-pmls-1 to be b@xmath4921.0 , i@xmath4918.2 and h@xmath5016 ( lpine & distefano 2011 ) .",
    "if the lens star is a binary , then the shape of the overall light curve , and the timing and magnitude of astrometric effects , will differ from the point - lens form .",
    "these deviations typically occur over a time scale that is comparable to @xmath51 and the value of @xmath41 can still be derived from a lensing model fit .",
    "if the lens star is orbited by planets , then a variety of signatures are possible . in the case of planets in orbits",
    "so wide that they essentially serve as independent lenses , their masses can be measured in the same way that the stellar mass can be measured .",
    "the time duration of the event will be shorter by a factor @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the mass of the planet . for closer orbital separations ,",
    "the presence of the planet is signaled by a deviation from the point - lens event produced by the stellar lens .",
    "model fits provide the mass ratio , @xmath54 so that the value of @xmath53 can be expressed in terms of @xmath55 this paper is devoted to exploring the signatures of planets in predicted lensing events .      the type of gravitational lensing effects that might be detectable , and their timing , depends on the paths of vb  10 and of the star to be lensed , [ vb  10]-pmls-1 .",
    "ideally we would be able to predict the exact path and compute the distance of closest approach to within a few mas , as well as the date of closest approach . because , however , there are uncertainties in the position and speed of vb  10 , and because we know little about [ vb  10]-pmls-1 , an exact prediction is not yet possible .",
    "what we can do instead , is to construct an ensemble of paths , each consistent with all the available data .",
    "[ tab ]    .column 1 : angular separation , @xmath56 measured in mas . column 2 : probability that the angle of closest approach , @xmath57 between vb  10 and [ vb  10]-pmls-1 will be smaller than @xmath58 column 3 : the date of closest approach for the specific path shown in figure 1 , with angle of closest approach approximately equal to @xmath58 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      planets can produce different lensing effects depending on the projected orbital separation between the planet and star .",
    "microlensing searches for planets have concentrated on planets in the so - called `` zone for resonant lensing '' , an annulus that extends from roughly @xmath59 to approximately @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) . for planets located in this zone , the caustic structures associated with lens multiplicity are relatively large .",
    "when the path of the source brings it behind one of these structures , or even near to one , the magnification can be much larger than it would be otherwise .",
    "the light curve takes on a distinctive shape that signals the presence of the planet . in order for the path to allow the source star to come close enough to the caustics",
    ", we must be in the `` resonant '' regime , @xmath62 .",
    "several light curves produced by planets in the `` '' are shown in both the top and bottom panels of figure 3 . in each case , the thick green solid curve shows the magnification expected if vb  10 does not have planets .",
    "each of the other colors and line types corresponds to a light curve produced if vb  10 has a planet in the .",
    "we will discuss this figure in more detail in  5 .",
    "for now , the important features to notice are the high peak magnifications ( @xmath63 in most cases ) exhibited by a large fraction of these light curves .",
    "model fits can provide the values of the mass ratio and the projected orbital separation ( in units of @xmath64 ) . in the case of vb  10",
    ", the zone for resonant lensing covers the angular range from @xmath10  mas to @xmath13  mas .",
    "the source would have to pass within this range in order for light curves like these to be produced .",
    "thus , if the path of the source brings it within the inner circle shown in figure 1 , planets in the zone for resonant lensing could be discovered . for larger values of @xmath65 ,",
    "fewer such light curves occur .",
    "once @xmath66 they are rare .",
    "hence we define the outer boundary of the resonant regime to be at @xmath67 .      for values of @xmath68",
    "less than roughly @xmath69 , the caustic structures are small , reducing the probability of detecting planets in close orbits .",
    "furthermore , in ordinary microlensing , when the distance to the lens , @xmath17 is typically only a few times smaller than the distance to the source , @xmath70 @xmath14 tends to be small , and finite - source - size effects can diminish the detectability of short - lived planet - induced deviations , further reducing the probability of planet detection .    for nearby lenses , however , it is possible to detect close - orbit planets ( distefano 2011 ) , and to determine the values of both @xmath71 and @xmath72 not only are finite - source - size effects less important , but for nearby planets , the einstein radius , @xmath64 , is smaller , so that orbits with small values of @xmath68 are likely to have short orbital periods .",
    "the region in the lens plane with magnification deviations from the point - lens form can pass over the source star more than once .",
    "the repetition of deviations makes them more likely to be detected .",
    "light curves for some close - orbit planets are shown in figure 4 .",
    "plotted is the difference between the magnification expected if there is a planet and the magnification expected if vb  10 alone passes in front of the source . shown",
    "are light curves produced for a range of systems , which will be discussed in more detail in  4 .",
    "for now , the important features to observe are the small size of the deviations and their repetitive nature . if ongoing or repetitive deviations of a few percent are detectable , then figure 4 illustrates that close - orbit planets with masses comparable to saturn or jupiter can be detected for @xmath68 as small as @xmath73 for a given value of @xmath68 , the signatures are longer - lived for larger values of q.    by the `` close - orbit regime '' we mean the range of angles of closest approach for which the effects of close - orbit planets are detectable .",
    "the effects of close - orbit planets are detectable for very close approaches , but they are also detectable out to distances of @xmath74 . for @xmath75 for example , the effects of close - orbit planets can be detected out to roughly @xmath76 @xmath11  mas in the case of vb  10 .",
    "thus , close - orbit planets can be detected even if the distance of closest approach , @xmath65 , is too large to detect planets in the zone for resonant lensing .",
    "the close - orbit regime extends from the origin to the edge of the disk with blue dots shown in figure 1 .      for larger distances of closest approach ,",
    "the only planets that can be detected are those in wide orbits ( distefano & scalzo 1999a , 1999b )",
    ". we will call a planetary orbit wide if its projected distance from vb  10 places it outside of the zone for resonant lensing ( @xmath68 greater than about @xmath12 ) .",
    "the presence of wide - orbit planets can be inferred in one of two ways .",
    "first , the presence of the planet can cause alterations in both the position of the stellar lens and in the isomagnification contours around the stellar lens .",
    "examination of the light curve produced by the star can therefore reveal the presence of wide - orbit planets .",
    "second , the planet itself may pass close to the background star [ vb  10]-pmls-1 , even though vb  10 itself does not .    for wide separations , the planet may essentially serve as an independent lens , producing a lensing light curve likely to be similar to one that would be produced by an isolated lens .",
    "figure 5 shows a sequence of events in which the value of @xmath68 ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 . in each case",
    ", there is a red light curve and a blue light curve corresponding to clockwise and counterclockwise face - on circular orbits , respectively .",
    "the time between the short - lived planet - induced deviation and the time of the peak of the stellar - lens event becomes progressively longer as @xmath68 increases , and the durations more closely mirror what they would have been without vb  10 .",
    "note that we have plotted each column with one range of times , but the range changes from column to column in order to optimize the presentation .",
    "we will consider these light curves further , and derive some of the relevant properties in  3 .",
    "wide - orbit planets would be so far from vb  10 that they can produce a separate event in the days , weeks , months or even years prior to or after the closest passage between vb  10 and the background star . thus ,",
    "if vb  10 hosts planets in wide orbits , the events they produce could occur at times when variations in [ vb  10]-pmls-1 are easier to detect , even if the closest passage between vb  10 and [ vb  10]-pmls-1 occurs when the sun s position is not favorable for the detection of the stellar - lens event .",
    "in addition to the advantage provided by a delayed event time , the event produced by a wide - orbit planet may happen to produce a larger magnification of [ vb  10]-pmls-1 than vb  10 itself ever does",
    ".    it would be difficult to specify a unique value of the projected separation , @xmath77 above which an orbit should be considered `` wide '' .",
    "if a planet and star have a projected orbital separation of approximately an einstein radius , the isomagnification contours are not asymmetric , and many corresponding to detectable magnifications encompass both star and planet . as the planet is moved farther from the star , the isomagnification contours separate and , for large enough orbits , the pattern of contours around the planet and star are each similar to the pattern expected for isolated masses ( figure 6 ) .",
    "light curves which show simultaneous evidence of lensing by both the star and planet become rarer as the projected separation increases .",
    "the star and planet can each produce well - separated events for projected separations as small as @xmath78 although this result depends on the value of the mass ratio and on the photometric sensitivity of the observations . in this paper",
    ", we consider the inner boundary of the wide regime to be approximately @xmath79 it is important to note , however , that , even though the planet - lens event may be separate from the stellar - lens event , the shape of the light curve associated with lensing by the planet can be influenced by the presence of the star until the value of @xmath68 is fairly large : figure 6 shows that the @xmath24 isomagnification contour is significantly distorted from a circular form , even for @xmath80 the significance of these distortions is twofold : they influence the light curve characteristics and , because they increase the linear dimensions of the region within which the magnification is significant , they increase the event probability .",
    "interestingly enough , in the case of vb  10 , its well - studied spatial motion allows us to determine a maximum orbital separation for a planet of a given mass .",
    "if vb  10 has a planet of mass @xmath53 , with a maximum separation from the center of mass of @xmath81 then vb  10 has a maximum separation @xmath82 from the center of mass of @xmath83 .",
    "there are , however , limits on the value of @xmath84 which can be derived from the astrometric limits of lazorenko et al .",
    "specifically , if a planet of @xmath85 in a @xmath86  day orbit is ruled out , then the maximum separation between vb  10 and the center of mass is @xmath87 . taking this as a rough guideline",
    ", the maximum orbital separation of the planet can be expressed as follows .",
    "@xmath88 at the distance to vb  10 , this corresponds to a maximum angular separation between a jupiter - mass planet and vb  10 of about @xmath89 .",
    "for less massive planets , wide planets may have proportionally larger orbits .",
    "the effects of parallax introduce significant deviations from straight - line motion . nevertheless , it is possible to use the straight - line approximation to estimate the relationship between the properties of a planetary orbit and the time at which an event caused by the planet will occur .",
    "let @xmath90 be the time of closest passage between vb  10 and the background star , and let @xmath65 be the distance of closest approach expressed in units of @xmath14 .",
    "if the time is expressed in days , and the proper motion @xmath40 is express in units of @xmath91 , then @xmath92    in order for the planet to create an independent event , it must generally be farther from vb  10 than the closest approach to the background star ( @xmath93 ) . for a given path",
    ", @xmath65 has a fixed value .",
    "suppose the value of @xmath65 happens to be large : for example , @xmath94 then orbits with values of @xmath68 near @xmath7 could produce detectable effects close to the time of closest approach , should the orbital phase happen to be just right .",
    "whatever the value of @xmath95 small or large , planets in orbits with progressively larger values of @xmath68 can produce events at longer time intervals before or after the closest passage .",
    "equation 3 highlights an important feature of predicted events , or indeed any event in which the angle of closest approach is known . _ during any given day before or after the event , we can compute the specific value of @xmath77 the projected orbital separation , of the planet whose lensing signature we can detect on that day_. actually , we compute a small range of possible values of @xmath77 since the size of the lensing region around the planet has a finite extent which can be computed for each set of values of @xmath71 and @xmath68 ( see figure 6 . ) uncertainties in the path also produce uncertainties in the possible day - by - day values of @xmath68 . thus ,",
    "if an event is detected on a specific day , say the 30th day after the main event , we can immediately estimate the value of @xmath68 ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the features of the associated light curve , including the value of @xmath51 allow us to estimate the mass of the planet , if the proper motion can be estimated .",
    "conversely , if no detection is made on a given day , we know what type of orbit is _ not _ producing an event .",
    "lack of evidence for an event on any given day does not translate to evidence for lack of a planet .",
    "it does , however , allow us to place limits on the possible presence of a planet as follows .",
    "we consider the times the observations that have been made and , for each , the minimum value of the magnification to which the observation would have been sensitive .",
    "then , by generating a large number of orbits for each value of @xmath68 and each value of @xmath71 , including a range of orbital eccentricities and inclinations , we can compute what fraction of the time a planet of each type would be detected .",
    "if the observations would have detected the planet @xmath96 of the time , then the failure to observe the planet means that it is not there .",
    "if , however , the probability of detecting the planet is @xmath97 then we can say that there is now a probability of only @xmath98 that such a planet orbits the lens star .",
    "the top panel of figure 7 shows the relationship between @xmath68 and @xmath99 predicted by equation 3 . that this relationship is approximately correct",
    "is verified by the positions of the hexagons ( for clockwise orbits ) and filled crosses ( for counterclockwise orbits ) , corresponding to systems included in our simulations for the @xmath10  mas approach ( red curve ) .",
    "the analytic results for the other @xmath10 approaches are also shown .",
    "the middle panel shows the orbital period for each of the @xmath100 approaches .",
    "the bottom panel shows the analytic relationship between the ratio of the orbital speed to proper motion as a function of @xmath72 the significance of this last panel is that it allows us to estimate the effect that orbital motion may have on the duration of wide - orbit planet - lens events .",
    "this panel shows that , for values of @xmath68 that produce deviations at times longer than @xmath101  days prior to or after the closest approach , the effects of orbital motion become negligible , but that orbital motion can influence the light curves for values of @xmath68 that produce planet - lens effects closer to @xmath90 .",
    "this is consistent with , for example , the longer duration of planet - lens events for clockwise versus counterclockwise orbits shown for @xmath68 smaller than about @xmath102 in figure 5 .",
    "* note on the time scales : * the angular speed of vb  10 is high , and the mass of the star is very low .",
    "this combination means that the einstein - diameter crossing time is smaller than typical , even for nearby stars . a star of mass equal to @xmath103 located @xmath11  pc away and lensing a distant source would have the same value of @xmath14 as vb  10 , but would have an angular speed likely to be only a tenth as large",
    "this means that the time scales on the horizontal axis of figure 7 would be multiplied by a factor of about @xmath7 .",
    "thus , for example , planets with @xmath104 could cause events 500 days prior to or after the time of closest approach .",
    "in addition , events would last longer , making isolated planet - lens events easier to detect .",
    "furthermore , orbital motion is more likely to be signifcant , rotating perturbed isomagnification contours into the vicinity of the background source , thereby increasing the event probability .",
    "we will return to this question in paper ii when we consider predicted events that are more ideal for detection than the predicted vb  10 event .      to estimate the probability that a wide - orbit planet will produce an event , we have conducted sets of simulations . in each simulation ,",
    "the center of mass follows one of the six paths shown in figure 1 , and vb  10 is orbited by a planet of fixed mass , @xmath53 , which executes a face - on circular orbit ( either clockwise or counterclockwise ) with a specific value of @xmath72 the simulation consists of generating a number of light curves ( up to @xmath105 ) , differing from each other because the initial orbital phase is chosen from a uniform random distribution . by computing the fraction of the generated events that display a specific event characteristic , we determine the probability that that characteristic will occur , should a planet of mass @xmath53 inhabit that type of orbit .",
    "[ note that the orbit is defined as a face - on circular orbit with a specific value of @xmath68 and a specific orientation ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) . ]",
    "results are shown in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "plotted in figure 8 is the maximum difference between the planet - lens light curve and the light curve generated by vb  10 alone , as a function of initial orbital phase .",
    "the sharp peaks correspond to cases in which the planet generated a clear independent event .",
    "the probability that a planet - induced event with a peak magnification above a certain value can be computed by finding the fraction of phases in which the magnification achieves this value or an even larger one .",
    "the results are shown in figure 9 . for close approaches and modest values of @xmath68 , the probability of a planet - induced deviation larger than a few percent can be larger than @xmath106 for more distant approaches , only planets with wider orbits can produce events , and",
    "the probability is corresponding lower , on the order of @xmath107 analogous calculations apply to planets of smaller mass , which can be located even farther from vb  10 without inducing motion in vb  10 that would have already been detected by , e.g. , pravdo & shaklan ( 2009 ) or other astrometric studies .    a simple analytic approach to computing the probability that a wide - orbit planet will produce a separate short - duration event is to compare the size of the region within which a planet produces significant effects with the size of the orbit .",
    "this ignores velocity effects , but can nevertheless provide a reasonable estimate of the fraction , @xmath108 of initial phases likely to produce an isolated planet - lens event .    to compute this fraction",
    ", we simply need to compute the ratio between ( 1 )  the size of the region around the planet that can produce detectable lensing effects , and , ( 2 )  the size of the orbit .",
    "we will express each in units of the einstein radius .",
    "the denominator , the size of the orbit , is simply @xmath109 . developing a good approximation for the value of the numerator",
    "requires some care .",
    "first , the size of the region within which lensing can be detected depends on the sensitivity of the observations .",
    "if only magnifications of @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) or more are detectable , then the width of the lensing region is @xmath112 [ @xmath113 ) ] .",
    "the factor to the left in each case correspond to the distance , in einstein radii , at which the magnification becomes detectable .",
    "we have taken this into account by introducing a factor @xmath114 , which is unity when deviations of @xmath115 are detectable , @xmath69 if deviations must be larger than @xmath110 are detectable , @xmath116 if deviations must be larger than @xmath24 to be detectable .",
    "a second factor influences the size of the lexpsning region associated with the planet .",
    "this is the proximity of the star . for values of @xmath68 in the range @xmath117 , the lensing region",
    "is significantly stretched , with the amount of stretching also dependent on the mass ratio , @xmath71 . for larger values of @xmath68",
    "the stretching is minimal . to take this into account",
    ", we have introduced the factor @xmath118 , which has the value roughly equal to @xmath119 for @xmath120 and @xmath121    with these definitions , the probability , @xmath122 , that a wide - orbit planet will produce an isolated event is @xmath123 where the sum is over wide - orbit planets .",
    "for @xmath124 the contribution is @xmath125 in line with the results shown in the graphs .",
    "we consider a sum over possible planets to include the possibility that vb  10 has multiple wide - orbit planets .",
    "note that the peak in the probability distribution for @xmath68 larger than unity , that has declined significantly in all cases before @xmath126 corresponds to the decreasing probability that the wide - orbit planet will produce its own isolated event as @xmath68 increases .",
    "in equation  ( 2 ) we considered the size of the astrometric shift of the lens star associated with the planetary orbit . from the astrometric studies of vb  10 ( see  2.3 ) , we know that the shift is small ( @xmath127  mas ) .",
    "given that @xmath128  mas , even a small shift can , however , change the magnification in a manner that is detectable .",
    "_ magnification effects can enhance the detectability of small shifts in the position of the star_.    consider the following example . on the @xmath10  mas approach , a shift in position of",
    "just @xmath119  mas could cause the peak magnification to increase from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",
    "a quick calculation finds that a @xmath119  mas shift in the position of vb  10 could be caused by a jupiter - mass planet in an orbit of @xmath131  au , a perfectly feasible possibility .",
    "the light curves in figure 5 show shifts in both the time and magnification of the stellar - lens event due to this effect .",
    "the probability associated of this effect being detectable is quantified in figures 10 ( @xmath132 ) and 11 ( @xmath133 ) for large @xmath68 .",
    "each of these two figures consists of panels , each for a single planet mass , ranging from a superearth to a planet 3 times as massive as jupiter .",
    "the light black curve shows the probability that a deviation @xmath24 or larger will occur .",
    "every subsequent curve corresponds to a deviation @xmath12  times larger than the last .",
    "one obvious effect is that there is an increasing probability of deviations toward larger values of @xmath68 .",
    "this is seen in every panel of figure 10 , and for the @xmath134 @xmath135 , and @xmath136 panels of figure 11 .",
    "this corresponds to an increasing probability of stellar astrometric shifts producing detectable deviations from the point - lens light curve .",
    "these results imply that fits to light curves produced by the star have the potential to identify deviations from the point - lens form and to discover wide - orbit planets .",
    "_ this is the case even when the planet itself does not produce a separate detectable event .",
    "_ figures 10 and 11 demonstrate that the increase in detection probability is significant .",
    "alternatively , if the planet does produce an independent event , then a check for consistency between information derived through the planet - lens and stellar - lens events can be made .",
    "if vb  10 happens to have planets with orbits much smaller than the einstein radius , the lensing signatures can also be significantly perturbed .",
    "this is because there is a small region within which the isomagnification contours are distorted from the circular form they would have had in the absence of the planet .",
    "these perturbations are typically maximized at a distance @xmath137 from the center of mass .",
    "@xmath138 can be as large as several times @xmath14 for @xmath139 in the absence of orbital motion , there would be only a small probability that the distorted region would pass in front of the source .",
    "the orbital period is short for small values of @xmath77 however .",
    "for example , a face - on circular orbit with @xmath140 would correspond to an orbital period around vb  10 of roughly @xmath141  days .",
    "this means that there can be a good chance that the distorted region will rotate in front of the source star , possibly even more than once .",
    "thus , even though the deviations tend to be small , repetition confers an advantage . in figure 4",
    "light curves associated with close - orbit planets are shown .",
    "plotted is @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the magnification of the planet - lens light curve and @xmath144 is the point - lens light curve that would be produced by vb  10 alone . while the individual deviations can be short - lived , the time interval over which they occur can be long , starting days before the closest approach and continuing until days after",
    ". the timescales could be much larger for other lens stars ( see _ note on the timescales ,  3.2 _ and paper ii ) .",
    "figure 4 shows that even a saturn - mass planet can produce detectable ( @xmath145 ) effects for @xmath68 as small as @xmath73 because the size of the deviations is smaller for smaller @xmath77 but the deviations are enhanced for more massive planets , we compare jupiter - mass and saturn - mass planets for @xmath146 , and jupiter - mass planets and @xmath147-jupiter - mass planets for @xmath148 the effects we see at early and late times are caused by the isomagnification deviations at @xmath138 .",
    "the deviations seen near the time of closest approach are associated with the astrometric motion of vb  10 itself , which is just a small wobble executed during the planet s orbit .",
    "as is the case for wide - orbit planets , lensing enhances the effect of the wobble by changing the position of the lens at the time of closest approach ( see  4.3 )    figure 12 also shows close - orbit light curves . here , as in the third panel from the top in figure 4 , we show the results for a jupiter - mass planet with @xmath140 .",
    "whereas in figure 4 , the angle of closest approach was @xmath149  mas ( @xmath150 ) , the distances of closest approach are varied in figure 12 .",
    "we have @xmath151 progressing from the top panel to the bottom panel .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath65 the smaller the effects , and the more sensitive the photometry required for detection .    just as there is a largest orbital separation for a wide - orbit planet , there is a smallest orbital separation for a close - orbit planet . to avoid catastrophic tidal disruption",
    "a planet must satisfy the condition @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the hill radius given by @xmath154 .",
    "thus the minimum orbital separation of a planet around vb  10 is roughly given by @xmath155    this corresponds to @xmath156 for the vb  10 case .",
    "close - orbit planets produce deviations both in advance of and after the closest approach .",
    "the time at which the deviations start is the time at which the region at @xmath138 passes in front of the source star .",
    "let @xmath157 be the time at which deviations related to the planet begin or end , representing the maximum time difference between the time of closest approach and the time at which deviations occur .",
    "if we measure time in days we have the analogue to equation ( 3 ) for close - orbit planets : @xmath158 in this case , the smaller the value of @xmath77 the longer the difference in time between the stellar - lens event and the planet - lens event .",
    "this effect is shown in figures 4 and 12 .",
    "as in  3.2 , we can compute a specific value of @xmath68 for a planet whose lensing signature we are capable of detecting on a given day .",
    "the top panel of figure 13 shows the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath159 predicted by equation ( 6 ) and is analogous to figure 7 for wide orbits .",
    "figure 13 also shows the important role of orbital motion in the close regime : the orbital period decreases with decreasing @xmath68 , corresponding to larger values of @xmath159 ( middle panel ) . as the orbital period decreases , the ratio of orbital velocity and proper motion , @xmath160 , increases , and plays an important role in the lensing signatures ( guo et al .",
    "2011 , penny et al .",
    "2011 , distefano 2011 ) .",
    "the relationship between @xmath160 and @xmath159 is shown in the bottom panel of figure 13 .",
    "note that there is an overlap between the region in which the effects of wide - orbit and close - orbit planets can be detected .",
    "if , for example , the distance of closest approach is @xmath161 then at similar times before and after the `` main '' event , it would be possible to detect both a wide - orbit planet with @xmath68 in the range @xmath162 and a close - orbit planet with @xmath68 in the range @xmath163 .",
    "of course planets in wider orbits could also be detected at much earlier and much later times .",
    "the details of the close regime are presented in distefano ( 2011 ) .",
    "the detection of close orbit planets relies on being sensitive to small deviations , on the order of a few percent or smaller , each of which may last less than a day .",
    "repetition means that , even if a deviation is missed , however , there still are other opportunities to establish with high reliability , the occurrence of ongoing deviations .",
    "consider the case of a close - orbit planet orbiting vb  10 with @xmath164 the orbital period is approximately @xmath147 days , producing deviations that repeat on a three day time scale , with the largest deviations occurring when the distance between the source and lens is approximately @xmath161 when the average magnification is about @xmath165 . as",
    "figure 4 shows , the deviations can be larger than a percent .    in figures 4 and 12",
    ", each panel contains 9 independent light curves , slightly displaced from each other so that the variations in each can be resolved .",
    "the nine light curves in each panel differ from each other only in that a different initial phase was chosen for each . _",
    "the effects were similar in all cases .",
    "_ this demonstrates that , if the observational strategy is capable of detecting deviations caused by planets with a given value of @xmath68 , orbital period , and @xmath71 , then it will detect such planets with certainty .",
    "thus , limits on close orbit planets can always be placed , if the observing conditions are favorable and the monitoring program is well designed .",
    "the vealues of @xmath68 for which we can derive limits or else guarantee a detection are determined by the photometric sensitivity , whilst those of @xmath71 are determined by the cadence of sampling .      as a close - orbit planet orbits a star",
    ", the star wobbles in its own smaller orbit .",
    "when the star serves as a lens , small changes in its position can make a measurable difference in the magnification it produces in a background star .",
    "this effect is responsible for the deviations displayed near the time of closest approach in each of the light curves in figure 4 .    in units of the einstein angle ,",
    "the wobble of the star has amplitude @xmath166 this leads to a magnitude variation @xmath167 , where @xmath65 is the distance of closest approach in units of @xmath42 for @xmath168 corresponding to the @xmath10  mas approach , the variation is @xmath169 for @xmath170 corresponding to the @xmath7  mas approach , the variation is @xmath171 as the distance of closest approach increases , the central deviations become smaller and are less easily detected",
    ". nevertheless , there are clearly some cases in which the magnification deviations caused by the astrometric shifts of the central star provide the strongest signature of lensing .",
    "when the possibility for discovering planets via microlensing was first discussed ( mao & paczyski 1991 ; gould & loeb 1992 ) , attention focused on cases in which the projected orbital separation between star and planet lies in the range @xmath172 for separations in this range , caustic curves play an important role and produce high magnifications .",
    "ground - based microlensing searches for planets have focused on finding planets in this resonant zone .",
    "lensing events are found by observing teams monitoring wide fields .",
    "events judged to have a high probability of exhibiting large magnification are targeted for almost continuous monitoring during the interval when the magnification is high .",
    "such intensive monitoring has a good chance of discovering planets in the resonant zone and , if there is no discovery , limits on their presence can be placed ( griest & safizadeh 1998 ) .    for vb  10 , angular separations between @xmath173 and @xmath174 correspond to projected distances in the lens plane which are in the range @xmath175  au-@xmath176  au ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "thus , the mean annular radius of the zone for resonant lensing is so small that the orbital period of any planets inhabiting this zone are short . for circular orbits ,",
    "the periods range from about @xmath100  days to roughly @xmath178  days . because it takes approximately @xmath102  days for vb  10 to cross a distance of @xmath179 , comparable to the distance over which dramatic lensing events",
    "could be observed , the probability of seeing planet - induced lensing effects is high .",
    "in essence , the region in the lens plane in which the isomagnification curves are very perturbed from the point - lens form , rotate over the position of the distant source . as long as @xmath65 is small enough that planets in the  produce detectable events ,",
    "the probability of detection can be high .",
    "the closer the approach , the higher the probability of detecting events in which the source has passed near a caustic structure .",
    "this is illustrated in in figure 3 , where light curves for a @xmath10  mas approach are shown .",
    "for @xmath180 ( top panel ) and @xmath181 ( bottom panel ) , ten randomly selected initial phases were each used to generate a light curve . for",
    "@xmath182 eight of the light curves showed significant deviations , three involving caustic crossings ( those exhibiting wall - like rises and falls ) . for @xmath183 all ten light curves displayed significant variations , with an even larger number of caustic crossings than for @xmath180 .",
    "figure 14 shows the probabilities and timescales associated with caustic crossings as a function of @xmath68 , for both @xmath10  mas and @xmath7  mas approaches , and both clockwise and counterclockwise orbits .",
    "multiple light curves were computed , and whenever a caustic crossing occurred , the characteristics of the event were noted .",
    "as we would expect , the probabilities and crossing times are markedly higher for the closest approach .",
    "there is also a significant difference in behavior for clockwise ( blue ) and counter clockwise ( red ) orbits .",
    "clockwise orbits tend to produce longer events , but the probability of a caustic crossing is somewhat reduced compared to the counterclockwise case .",
    "for @xmath184 in clockwise orbits , @xmath185 of light curves exhibit caustic crossings with a typical timescale of @xmath186  hours .",
    "this contrasts with @xmath187 of light curves and timescales of @xmath188  hours in the counter clockwise case .",
    "note , however , that caustic crossings are not needed to produce a large increase in magnification .",
    "this is shown by the presence of smooth curves in figure 3 , which do not exhibit the sharp features of a caustic crossing but which nevertheless produce detectable deviations . in figures 10 and 11 ,",
    "the probability that deviations of a certain size will occur , starting at @xmath24 and increasing by a factor of two in each subsequent curve ( see  3.4 ) are shown . for the @xmath10  mas ( @xmath189 )",

    "<S> ( 2 )  close - orbit planets can be detected for intermediate distances of closest approach ( @xmath1  mas for vb  10 ) , producing quasiperiodic signatures that may occur days or weeks before and after the stellar - lens event . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 )  planets in the so - called `` zone for resonant lensing '' can significantly increase the magnification when the distance of closest approach is small ( @xmath2  mas for vb  10 ) , making the stellar - lens event easier to detect while simultaneously providing evidence for planets . </S>",
    "<S> we show that an observing plan in which vb  10 is targeted several times per night at each of several longitudes will either detect planets , or else place weak limits on possible parameters . </S>",
