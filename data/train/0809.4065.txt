    "low energy supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite is one of the most active fields of research for physics beyond the standard model ( sm)@xcite . a minimal extension of the standard model when supersymmetry is incorporated is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite that includes two higgs doublets .",
    "the model however has a large number of susy breaking parameters and this motivates one into studying models with specific mechanisms for breaking susy .",
    "the later involves high scale physics input and renormalization group analyses .",
    "this in general leads to a large reduction of the number of unknown parameters .",
    "the minimal supergravity ( msugra)@xcite model is one of the well studied susy models .",
    "it requires a very few input parameters at the gauge coupling unification scale or grand unified theory ( gut ) scale , @xmath3  gev .",
    "the parameters indeed quantify our ignorance of the exact nature of susy breaking .",
    "the model incorporates radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry ( rewsb ) .",
    "the unification scale universal input parameters are : i ) the gaugino mass parameter @xmath4 , ii ) the scalar mass parameter @xmath5 and iii ) the tri - linear susy breaking parameter @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , one has to provide with @xmath7 , the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values and the sign of the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath8 .",
    "renormalization group evolutions are used to obtain the electroweak scale parameters of mssm .",
    "there is however no _ a priori _ necessity of considering such universalities of parameters .",
    "indeed , it is worthwhile to explore scenarios with non - universalities in the scalar or in the gaugino masses at the unification scale@xcite .",
    "non - universal scalar masses may appear because of non - flat khler potential@xcite .",
    "however , one must be careful to accommodate the stringent constraints from phenomena involving flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "satisfying fcnc constraints demands near - degeneracy of the first two generations of scalar masses but the requirements on the third generation of scalars as well as the higgs scalars are not so stringent @xcite .",
    "thus it is seen that fcnc constraints as well as constraints from cp - violating phases ( for example , those arising from the electric dipole moments of the electron and neutron ) may be managed by introducing multi - tev scalar masses for the first two generations of scalars@xcite .",
    "the third generations of scalar masses and the higgs scalar masses however should be adequately light in order to satisfy naturalness@xcite .",
    "there have been several efforts for obtaining the desired features as outlined above .",
    "analyses with radiatively generated inverted mass hierarchy models ( rimh ) were made in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors achieved the above - mentioned requirements at the electroweak scale by using @xmath9 yukawa unification with special non - universal relationship among the scalar masses at @xmath10 . here",
    ", the higgs and the third generation of scalar masses are rapidly diminished at the electroweak scale via rg evolutions . however , the yukawa unification and the consideration of rewsb constrain such models heavily .",
    "a second realization of the above idea is partially possible via the hyperbolic branch ( hb)/ focus point ( fp)@xcite scenarios where the scalars may become considerably massive ( multi - tev ) in a subset of the typical msugra parameter space satisfying universal boundary conditions while fine - tuning@xcite still remains small .",
    "a third possibility was considered in ref.@xcite , where plain decoupling arguments motivated the authors in using explicit splitting at @xmath10 between the scalars belonging to the first two generations and the same of the third generation ( along with the higgs scalars ) . here the first two generations of scalars were chosen in the multi - tev domain whereas the third generation of scalars as well as the higgs scalars were considered to be in the sub - tev zone .",
    "additionally , a large value of the tri - linear coupling parameter was chosen in ref.@xcite for the first two - generations .",
    "universality of scalar masses in the first two - generations along with a choice of a different scalar mass parameter for the third generation as well as the higgs scalars , or even splitting of squarks and sleptons within the third generation itself have also been considered in refs.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors additionally considered non - universality in the gaugino masses and analyzed the fine - tuning aspect of computing the relic density of dark matter in addition to obtaining a parameter zone of the mssm corresponding to a well tempered neutralino .",
    "similarly , analyses with only non - universalities in the higgs scalar may be seen in refs.@xcite .",
    "a comprehensive set of characteristic possibilities for varieties of non - universal sugra scenarios may be seen in ref.@xcite .    in this analysis",
    "we explore a sugra scenario with non - universal scalar masses that i ) allows to have very large first two - generation of scalar masses so as to obey the fcnc and the cp - violation limits easily ( _ ie . _ without requiring any ultra - small phases ) and that would not impose any additional price on fine - tuning , ii ) spans a large amount of mssm parameter space satisfying the neutralino relic density constraint from wmap data by not requiring any delicate mixing of bino and higgsinos , so that we would find a bino - dominated lightest neutralino for most of the parameter space and , iii ) satisfies the higgs mass lower bound from lep2 data as well as other low energy constraints .",
    "certainly , a model with rewsb and universal scalar mass like msugra is not friendly to achieve these objectives if we consider a common gaugino mass parameter below a tev or so .",
    "the above phenomenologically inspired requirements in combination motivate us to introduce non - universality between the third and the first two - generation of scalars as well as the higgs scalars .",
    "this has to be such that the rewsb conditions would not become prohibitive to have a multi - tev first two - generation of scalars .",
    "here we would like to point out that we would not be able to satisfy the mentioned objectives by considering non - universalities only in the higgs scalar masses .",
    "a simpler and purely phenomenological attempt in this direction in a universal gaugino mass framework could be to generate all the third generation of scalar masses and the higgs scalar masses radiatively , starting from zero values at the unification scale , while keeping the first two - generations of scalar masses universal ( and this may be in the multi - tev zone ) .",
    "we point out that starting with a similar range of values for the higgs scalars as with the third generation of scalars at @xmath10 would be desirable since this would lead to similar range of mass values for all the soft - susy breaking terms contributing to rewsb after rg evolutions .",
    "however , if we consider all the third generation of scalars at @xmath10 to be light , we would find stau ( @xmath11 ) becoming the lightest stable particle ( lsp ) or even tachyonic at the electroweak scale . on a similar note ,",
    "we remind that such an appearance of tachyonic sleptons also arise in the anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) analyses , and it is avoided purely by a phenomenologically inspired way of adding an appropriate non - zero mass value to all the scalars at the unification scale in the minimal amsb scenario@xcite . thus with a simple motivation of managing with fcnc and cp - violation , naturalness as well as the dark matter constraints concurrently we consider a non - zero mass value for the third generation of sleptons , while having the masses of squarks of the third generation and the higgs scalars vanishing at @xmath10 .",
    "additionally , for convenience we set the third generation of slepton mass parameters the same as that of the first two - generation of scalars at @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the parameters of our non - universal scalar mass model which will henceforth be called the nusm model is given by , , a_0 , sign ( ) ,  and  m_0 where the scalar mass input assignments at @xmath10 are as follows .",
    "+ i ) the unification scale mass parameter for the first two - generations of squarks , sleptons and the third generation of sleptons is @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is allowed to span up to a very large value .",
    "+ ii ) the mass parameters for the third generation of squarks and higgs scalars are set to zero .",
    "+ we could have also chosen a non - vanishing value for ii ) as long as it is sufficiently small .",
    "we may note here that different values of mass parameters for squarks and sleptons at @xmath10 may appear in orbifold models with large threshold corrections .",
    "this is related to having different modular weights associated with the squarks and the sleptons in a given generation@xcite .",
    "as we will see below , the nusm model provides with a highly bino - dominated neutralino dark matter over almost its full range of parameter space .",
    "it has an interesting feature of having a large funnel region , a region of parameter space where the associated annihilation channels are characterized by the direct channel pole @xmath12 .",
    "we note that unlike msugra where one finds the funnel region only for a large value of @xmath1 , here in the nusm one finds it for almost all possible values of @xmath13 .",
    "we will also see that the nusm is further characterized by a lighter @xmath14 or @xmath15 particularly when @xmath5 is large and this is found even for small values of @xmath16 .",
    "a small part of the parameter space may be far from the decoupling@xcite region of higgs boson mixing that causes the lighter cp - even higgs boson ( @xmath17-boson ) to be non - standard model like@xcite .",
    "this in turn reduces the lower bound of @xmath18 much below the lep2 higgs boson mass limit .    in this work",
    "we include a semi - analytic calculation that first points out a large mass effect in the solution of the renormalization group equations ( rge ) of @xmath0 .",
    "the effect causes a hyperbolic branch / focus point like behavior is associated with the first minimization condition of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking . in this analysis",
    "we do not have such an effect . on the contrary we have a similar hb",
    "/ fp effect for small values of @xmath1 in connection with the second minimization condition that is associated with @xmath2 . ] in @xmath19 that may cause @xmath14 to become smaller even for a small @xmath1 as mentioned above .",
    "here we remind that @xmath14 typically becomes smaller in msugra only for large @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[nusmhbfp",
    "] we will primarily discuss the large mass rge effects in the nusm on @xmath2 and its consequent reduction for large @xmath5 via an hb / fp - like effect .",

    "] we will discuss the direct and indirect detection ( via continuous gamma ray ) rates of the lsp .",
    "finally we will conclude in sec.[concl ] .",
    "in this section we focus on the key elements that are important for the nusm .",
    "the primary quantities of phenomenological interest are @xmath8 , and @xmath14 .",
    "these in turn have important significance on the following : i ) the issue of fine - tuning , ii ) the presence of non - standard model like lighter higgs boson mass bound for a limited region of parameter space , iii ) dark matter and iv ) collider discovery possibilities .",
    "additionally , we remind ourselves about obtaining a lighter third generation of squarks at the electroweak scale and this is of course related to their vanishing values at the unification scale .    to start with",

    "the above clearly shows the large slepton mass effect because the dependence of @xmath68 or @xmath0 on @xmath71 arises from the term of eq.[hdeqn ] that is associated with @xmath82 .",

    "we note that there is no lsm effect that may modify @xmath44 of eq.[mueqn ] at the one - loop level .",
    "this is simply because @xmath24 and there is no possibility of having a lsm effect in the corresponding rge of eq.[hueqn ] .",
    "on the other hand , an improved @xmath0 as obtained above in eqs.[mhdsoln ] and [ chdneweqn ] changes the result of @xmath2 ( eq.[maeqn ] and [ cdeqn ] ) but the later does not receive any additional @xmath83 dependence other than what is already contributed from eq.[chdneweqn ] .",

    ", we find that the lsm effect causes @xmath2 to have a hb / fp like behavior for its dependence on @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "hence , @xmath14 may become significantly small for a large @xmath5 because of a cancellation between the terms .",
    "this of course may happen even for a small value of @xmath1 .",
    "a very large @xmath5 would cause @xmath2 to become tachyonic , or would result into an absence of rewsb ( eq.[rewsbbeqn ] ) . for a large @xmath1 on the other hand ,",

    "we comment here that in spite of showing the one - loop results we performed a complete numerical solution of the rges up to two loops in this analysis using suspect@xcite .",
    "we now point out that a simple non - universal higgs scalar mass scenario as described in ref.@xcite may also provide a small @xmath14 along with a funnel type of region that satisfies the wmap data , for a smaller value of @xmath1 .",

    "we have chosen different values of @xmath5 in the two figures because of the fact that a large @xmath5 is prohibited in msugra via the rewsb constraint whereas a choice of a small @xmath5 in the nusm would have a negligible lsm effect .",
    "clearly , @xmath0 stays positive at the electroweak scale in msugra ( fig.[masssqvsqa ] ) . on the other hand the same for the nusm turns toward a negative value while running from @xmath10 to the electroweak scale ( fig.[masssqvsqb ] ) and this essentially shows the lsm effect in @xmath2 .",

    "these regions are associated with small @xmath93 and small @xmath5 zones near the boundary of the discarded zone where staus become the lsp .",
    "stau coannihilation is also an effective way to bring the neutralino relic density to an acceptable level in the nusm .",
    "coannihilations of lsp may also occur with stop ( @xmath130 ) in a general mssm scenario@xcite or even in msugra@xcite .",
    "however , in spite of having relatively lighter @xmath130 , the nusm does not have such a region unless one reduces the mass of @xmath130 further via appropriately considering non - zero values for @xmath6 .",
    "+ iv ) the most important region satisfying wmap data for our study is the higgs - pole annihilation or _ funnel _ region@xcite . the funnel region that satisfies the wmap data",
    "is characterized by the direct - channel pole @xmath131 .",
    "this occurs in msugra typically for large @xmath1 extending to larger @xmath5 and larger @xmath93 regions . in the nusm",
    "however , the funnel region occurs in all possible @xmath13 .",
    "indeed apart from the lsp - stau coannihilation appearing in a small region , higgs - pole annihilation is the primary mechanism in the nusm to satisfy the wmap constraint throughout the parameter space .",
    "we now show the results of the computation of the neutralino relic density using the code micromegas@xcite . in fig.[t10nuspectrum ] that corresponds to @xmath80 the region with red dots in the @xmath132 plane satisfy the wmap constraint ( eq.[relicdensity ] ) for the neutralino relic density . for a small @xmath5",
    "we find the stau coannihilation region marked with red dots .",
    "the gray region below the stau coannihilation region is discarded because of the appearance of charged lsps .",
    "the upper gray region is discarded broadly via @xmath2 turning negative except near the boundary where there can be interplay with other constraints as described below .",
    "thus if we concentrate on the boundary of the discarded region , the smallest @xmath93 zone ( below 160 gev or so ) is ruled out by the lep2 lower limit of sparticle masses@xcite .",
    "this is followed by obtaining tachyonic sfermion scalars ( particularly stop scalars ) when @xmath4 is increased further up to @xmath133 600 gev .",
    "the same boundary zone for the larger @xmath93 region is eliminated because of the appearance of the charge and color breaking ( ccb ) minima@xcite . in the nusm",
    "this happens via the ccb conditions that involve @xmath0 , the later becoming negative makes the ccb constraint stronger . in the region between the stau coannihilation area and the upper gray shaded discarded area one finds a long red region that satisfies the wmap constraint for @xmath111 . as mentioned before , the reason for satisfying the wmap data is the direct channel annihilation of two lsps via neutral higgs bosons .",
    "fig.[t10nufunnel ] shows a scanned output for @xmath80 when @xmath5 is varied as in fig.[t10nuspectrum ] .",
    "the lsp mass is plotted against @xmath134 so as to show the extent of the @xmath89-annihilation or funnel effect .",
    "clearly the wmap satisfied points shown in red fall around the zero of the y - axis confirming that the funnel region appears in the nusm for small @xmath1 as well .",
    "we note that the @xmath89-width can be quite large ( @xmath135-@xmath136  gev ) and @xmath137 can be appreciably away from the exact resonance zone still giving a @xmath138-channel annihilation consistent with the wmap data .",
    "the heavy scalar higgs boson @xmath139 also significantly contributes to the total annihilation cross - section .",
    "we now discuss the result of using a few constraints .",
    "first , we use the lep2 limit@xcite of @xmath127 gev for the sm higgs boson . for the cp - even lighter susy higgs boson mass @xmath18",
    "we use the same constraint as long as we are in the decoupling region@xcite where the susy @xmath17-boson is sm - like . in the nusm",
    "this is true for almost all the parameter space except a very small region with small @xmath4 and for @xmath96 which we will discuss later .",
    "additionally , we note that there is an uncertainty of about 3  gev in computing the mass of the light higgs boson@xcite .",
    "this theoretical uncertainty primarily originates from momentum - independent as well as momentum - dependent two - loop corrections , higher loop corrections from the top - stop sector etc .",
    "hence , we have drawn a contour for @xmath140  gev in order to consider an effective lower limit .",
    "gev and @xmath141  gev . ]",
    "we have further drawn the @xmath142 contour by considering a 3@xmath103 limit@xcite , @xmath143 clearly in fig.[t10nuspectrum ] this constraint would keep the @xmath144  gev region alive and this is indeed the region of super - large @xmath145  tev that satisfies the wmap data . in this context",
    "we should however note that the @xmath146 constraint may be of less importance if some additional theoretical assumptions are taken into consideration .",
    "the computation of the constraint in models like msugra assumes a perfect alignment of the squark and quark mass - matrices .",
    "this essentially considers an unaltered set of mixing angle factors than the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) factors at the corresponding sm vertices .",
    "even a small set of off - diagonal terms in squark mass matrices at the unification scale may cause a drastic change in the mixing pattern of the squark sector at the electroweak scale .",
    "this however does not cause any effective change in the sparticle mass spectra or in the flavor conserving process of neutralino annihilation or in generating events in a hadron collider in any significant way .",
    "a brief review of the model - dependent assumptions for the @xmath147 analyses may be seen in refs.(@xcite , @xcite ) and references therein .",
    "we now explain an interesting aspect of the nusm higgs boson as a consequence of the lsm effect . as we have seen before",
    ", @xmath14 decreases with increasing @xmath5 in the nusm .",
    "we find that with larger @xmath5 , @xmath14 may become very light for the small @xmath4 zone so that we may find a spectrum where @xmath148 and this indeed is a consequence of moving into the intense - coupling@xcite region of higgs bosons .",
    "this results in a change in the value of the coupling @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the mixing angle between two neutral higgs bosons @xmath17 and @xmath139 .",
    "typically in the decoupling region @xmath151 stays very close to @xmath152 , but in the intense coupling region this can be considerably small like 0.5 or lesser .",
    "this effectively reduces the lower limit of @xmath18 to 93 gev , a value close to @xmath153 . in the nusm",
    "we obtain this effect for a small region of parameter space ( small @xmath4 ) if @xmath96 .",
    "fig.[t15nuspectrum ] shows such a region ( this may also satisfy the wmap limits ) for @xmath154  gev and this appears very close to the top gray shaded discarded zone .",
    "fig.[t15nuhiggsmixing ] demonstrates the existence of a small @xmath151 in the nusm as discussed above .",
    "however with @xmath99 , we will see that such a very light @xmath14 or @xmath18 region is almost discarded via the present limit of the @xmath155 .",
    "the current experimental limit for the @xmath156 coming from cdf@xcite puts a strong constraint on the mssm parameter space .",
    "the experimental bound is given by ( at @xmath157 ) @xmath158 the estimate of @xmath21@xcite in the mssm sensitively depends on the mass of a - boson ( @xmath159 ) and on the value of @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "@xmath21 constraint eliminates the thin region along the boundary of the rewsb in nusm where @xmath14 is very light . as mentioned before , for @xmath96 a part of the above region for small @xmath4 zone has non - standard model like @xmath17-boson .",
    "apart from the above constraints we would like to remind that there is no non - universality in the first two - generations in nusm .",
    "this saves from the stringent fcnc violating limits such as those coming from the @xmath162-@xmath163 mass difference or from the @xmath164 bound .",
    "splitting of the first generation and the third generation of scalars may also cause violations of fcnc bounds , although to a lesser extent .",
    "following ref.@xcite we see that for no violation of fcnc one would need ( for equal gluino and average squark masses ) @xmath165 . here",
    "@xmath166 refers to the average squark mass . considering the analysis performed in ref.@xcite for different gluino masses",
    "we conclude that the results of our analysis stay in the safe zone regarding the fcnc bounds in spite of the inter - generational splitting between the squarks .",
    "fig.[t40nuspectrum ] shows the results for @xmath167 . here",
    "the funnel region is extended up to @xmath168  tev .",
    "a large value of @xmath1 increases @xmath45 and @xmath46 and this would enhance the width @xmath169@xcite .",
    "we point out that unlike fig.[t10nuspectrum ] , here the reach of @xmath5 decreases for a given @xmath93 .",
    "the mass of a - boson decreases with increase of @xmath5 much more rapidly because of larger @xmath45 and @xmath46 arising out of larger values of @xmath1 . here , the very light @xmath14 region that satisfies the wmap data and that evades the lep2 higgs boson limit exists near the top gray boundary for @xmath170  gev which is again ruled out via the @xmath155 limit .",
    "the upper gray region is typically discarded here via the rewsb constraint of @xmath2 that turns negative at the tree level .",
    "finally , we have not imposed any limit from the muon @xmath171 data that may or may not show a discrepancy from the standard model result .",
    "it is known that using the recent @xmath172-@xmath173 data leads to a @xmath174 level of discrepancy . on the other hand , using hadronic @xmath77-decay data in computing the leading order hadronic contribution to muon @xmath171 washes away@xcite any deviation from the sm result .",
    "we would focus on a few characteristic parameter points to discuss the nature of the nusm spectra that satisfy the wmap limits .",
    "clearly one is able to reach a considerably large @xmath5 satisfying dark matter relic density constraints and all other necessary constraints for @xmath175  tev . as an example with @xmath176  tev ,",
    "this limit is around @xmath177  tev for @xmath80 , @xmath178  tev for @xmath179 , and @xmath180  tev for @xmath167 .",
    "thus , for larger @xmath1 the reach of @xmath5 decreases considerably . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not unusual to obtain an @xmath89-pole annihilation region for a large @xmath1 in popular models like msugra .",
    "hence , if we are interested in focusing on a region of the mssm that is not available in msugra type of models we would rather explore the smaller @xmath1 domain of the nusm .",
    "the other important zone of parameter space could be the region with smaller @xmath4 because this would be easily accessible in lhc in its early run .",
    "we pick up a point on fig.[t10nuspectrum ] ( _ scenario - a _ ) that just satisfies the minimum value of @xmath140  gev besides being consistent with the wmap data for cold dark matter .",
    "the input parameters are : @xmath181 .",
    "the scenario - a of table  [ tabnusm ] thus has light stop and light sbottom quarks , light charginos and neutralinos and at the same time it would have a light higgs spectra , all of which are promising for an early lhc detection .",
    "we remind ourselves that typically the nusm is associated with a heavy first two - generation of scalars and heavy sleptons for all the three generations .",
    "we note that we have relaxed the @xmath182 constraint keeping in mind of the argument given after eq.[bsgammalimits ] .",
    "we could of course respect the constraint , only at a price of having a little heavier spectra , still that would be very much accessible in lhc for the third generation of squarks , higgs bosons , charginos etc .",
    "this however would not cause any essential change in the general pattern . on the other hand , with",
    "not so light @xmath14 and with a small @xmath1 the scenario - a satisfies the @xmath155 limit .",
    "the _ scenario - b _ of fig.[t15nuspectrum ] refers to a special point ( @xmath183 , @xmath184 ) for which the higgs sector is not in the decoupling region thus reducing the limit of @xmath18 to a value near the z - boson mass .",
    "this parameter point obeys the @xmath155 limit but as with the _ scenario - a _ it has an inadequate @xmath185 . with smaller @xmath4 and smaller @xmath5",
    "_ scenario - b _ has a lighter spectrum in general than _ scenario - a_. particularly , we find a much smaller higgs boson spectra .",
    "the _ scenario - c _ ( with @xmath186 , @xmath187 ) , that satisfy all the constraints including the @xmath182 bound provides a relatively heavier spectra .",
    "this is however still within the lhc reach for the relevant part of the nusm as mentioned above .",
    "we note that the large @xmath5 domain of the nusm is typically associated with lighter higgs spectrum and this region may in general be probed via the production of all mssm higgs bosons and subsequently their decays .",
    "the squarks corresponding to the first two generations and sleptons of all the generations are large when @xmath5 is large . as a result",
    "the production cross - section of these particles will be too low at the lhc .",
    "thus , to see any susy signal for the nusm one should primarily analyze productions and decays of gluino , stop and sbottom in addition to charginos and neutralinos . in a part of the parameter space",
    "where the higgs spectra is light , all the higgs states may be produced via @xmath188 either via loop - induced processes like ( @xmath189 ) or through cascade decays via heavier charginos and neutralinos @xmath190 .",

    "broadly , such a peak covers the region of @xmath5 for a given @xmath93 where wmap data for the neutralino relic density is satisfied . with an increase in @xmath1 the width @xmath169 of @xmath14 increases and the peak associated with a given halo profile broadens .",
    "we see that in spite of having a broad range of halo profile characteristics , the photon flux in the region of resonance annihilation in the nusm where the wmap data is satisfied may be probed in the upcoming glast@xcite experiment at least for the cuspier profiles .",
    "glast would be able to probe photon - flux as low as @xmath197 @xmath198@xcite .",
    "we note that this conclusion remains valid in spite of the fact that glast will use an aperture of @xmath199  sr so that an appropriate scaling of the photon - flux in fig.([photonfluxvsm0 ] ) needs to be done from table  ( [ profiletable ] ) and eq.([totalphotonflux ] ) .",

    "we started with purely phenomenological motivations namely , i ) to manage the fcnc and cp - violation type of constraints by decoupling , ii ) to obtain wmap satisfied values for neutralino relic density for a broad region of parameter space without depending on any delicate mixing of gauginos and higgsinos , iii ) to have radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and iv ) to keep naturalness within control . keeping the above in mind and considering a unified gaugino mass scenario , we used a common scalar mass parameter @xmath5 at the gauge coupling unification scale for the first two - generation of scalars as well as the third generation of sleptons .",
    "the item ( i ) mentioned above would require @xmath5 to be large , and the item ( iv ) would prefer light third generation of squarks and light higgs scalars . for simplicity",
    "we used vanishing third generation of squarks and higgs scalar masses at the unification scale .",
    "in such a scenario with a possibly multi - tev @xmath5 , we first found a large mass effect or in particular large slepton mass effect in the rge of @xmath0 ( _ ie .",

    "extending the semi - analytic solution of @xmath2 by considering the @xmath45 and the @xmath46 terms ( this is required here even for a small @xmath1 ) relevant for the large slepton mass effect we found a hyperbolic branch / focus point like effect in @xmath205 for small @xmath1 .",
    "this causes @xmath14 to be almost independent of @xmath5 for a large domain of the later .",
    "but , with a very large @xmath5 this causes @xmath14 to become very light or this may even turn @xmath2 negative giving rise to no radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we further found that because of such large slepton mass effect in the rge , the higgs sector may reach an intense coupling region with all the higgs bosons becoming very light and this may evade the lep2 limit of @xmath18 for a limited region of parameter space . however , constraint from @xmath206 becomes stringent in this region because of lighter @xmath14 . in general , we find relatively lighter @xmath14 or @xmath15 and this fact leads to a large @xmath89-pole annihilation region or funnel region of dark matter even for a small @xmath1 .",
    "this is in contrast to minimal supergravity type of scenarios where funnel region may occur only for large values of @xmath1 .",
