    "the standard model(sm ) provides an excellent effective field theory description of almost all particle physics experiments .",
    "but the higgs boson mass suffers from an instability under radiative corrections in the sm .",
    "the natural argument suggests that the cutoff scale of the sm is not much above the electroweak scale : new physics will appear around tev energies .",
    "the possible new physics scenarios at the tev scale might be supersymmetry@xcite , dynamical symmetry breaking@xcite , extra dimensions@xcite .",
    "recently , a new model , known as little higgs model , has drawn a lot of interest and it offers a very promising solution to the hierarchy problem in which the higgs boson is naturally light as a result of nonlinearly realized symmetry @xcite .",
    "the key feature of this model is that the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson of an approximate global symmetry which is spontaneously broken by a vev at a scale of a few tev and thus is naturally light .",
    "the most economical little higgs model is the so - called littlest higgs model , which is based on a @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model @xcite .",
    "it consists of a @xmath2 global symmetry , which is spontaneously broken down to @xmath3 by a vacuum condensate @xmath4 . in this model ,",
    "a set of new heavy gauge bosons@xmath5 and a new heavy - vector - like quark(t ) are introduced which just cancel the quadratic divergence induced by the sm gauge boson loops and the top quark loop , respectively .",
    "the distinguishing features of this model are the existence of these new particles and their couplings to the light higgs",
    ". the measurement of these new particle effects might prove the existence of the littlest higgs mechanism .",
    "+ the hunt for the higgs and the elucidation of the symmetry breaking mechanism is one of the most important goals for present and future high energy collider experiments .",
    "precision electroweak measurement data and direct searches suggest that the higgs boson must be relative light and its mass should be roughly in the range of 114.4 gev@xmath6208 gev at @xmath7 cl @xcite .",
    "while the discovery of the higgs at the lhc has been established for a wide range of higgs masses , only rough estimates on its properties will be possible , through measurements on the couplings of the higgs to the fermions and gauge boson for example @xcite .",
    "the most precise measurements will be performed in the clean environment of the future high energy @xmath8 linear collider , the international linear collider(@xmath9 ) with the center of mass(c.m . )",
    "energies @xmath10=300 gev-1.5 tev @xcite and the yearly luminosity 500 @xmath11 . at low energy ,",
    "the main production processes of the higgs boson at linear collider experiments are the higgs - strahlung process @xmath12 and the @xmath13 fusion process @xmath14 and the latter is dominant in the large parameter space .",
    "these two processes have been studied in the context of the sm @xcite and the littlest higgs model @xcite . with the c.m .",
    "energy increasing , the cross section of the process @xmath0 increases significantly .",
    "so , at the ilc , such process becomes a welcome addition with a cross section about @xmath15 fb which excesses that of @xmath16 production around 1tev . with the large cross section at tev scale",
    ", the ilc will open a promising window to probe higgs and precisely determinate the @xmath17 coupling via the process @xmath0 .",
    "the calculation of the complete electroweak correction to the process is performed in detail in the refrence@xcite .",
    "if the higgs boson is light , a few percent measurement precision can be reached at the @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the correction of the littlest higgs model to the process @xmath0 and see whether the effect on this process can be observed at the future @xmath9 experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section two , we first briefly introduce the littlest model , and then give the production amplitude of the process .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are presented in section three .",
    "the conclusions are given in section four .",
    "the littlest model is based on the a @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model . at the scale @xmath18@xmath4",
    ", the global @xmath2 symmetry is broken into its subgroup @xmath3 via a vacuum condensate @xmath4 , resulting in 14 goldstone bosons .",
    "the effective field theory of these goldstone bosons is parameterized by a non - linear @xmath19 model with gauged symmetry @xmath20^{2}$ ] , spontaneously breaking down to its diagonal subgroup @xmath21 , identified as the sm electroweak gauge group .",
    "four of these goldstone bosons are eaten by the broken gauge generators , leaving 10 states that transform under the sm gauge group as a doublet h and a triplet @xmath22 .",
    "this breaking scenario also gives rise to four massive gauge bosons @xmath23,@xmath24 and @xmath25 , which might produce the characteristic signatures at the present and future high energy collider experiments @xcite .",
    "+ after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the mass eigenstates are obtained via mixing between the heavy and light gauge bosons .",
    "they include the light ( sm - like ) bosons @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 observed at experiments , and new heavy bosons @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 that could be observed at future experiments .",

    ", we calculate the amplitudes numerically by using the method of the references@xcite which can greatly simplify our calculation .",
    "the process @xmath64 has been studied in the sm and the one - loop electroweak correction has been considered@xcite . because the t - channel contribution to the cross section rises depending on @xmath65 ,",
    "the total cross section can reach the order of @xmath66 fb with @xmath67 gev . the electroweak correction is negative and in the range from @xmath68 to @xmath69 . in this paper , we calculate the littlest higgs correction to the process in the tree level .    in the numerical calculation , we take the input parameters as @xmath70 gev , @xmath71 @xcite . for the light higgs boson h , in this paper , we only take the illustrative value @xmath72 gev .",
    "energy of the ilc is assumed as @xmath10=800 gev . in the littlest higgs model ,",
    "there are three free parameters , @xmath73 , involved in the production amplitude . the custodial @xmath74 global symmetry is explicitly broken , which can generate large contributions to the electroweak observables .",
    "however , if we carefully adjust the @xmath37 section of the theory the contributions to the electroweak observables can be reduced and the constraints become relaxed . the scale parameter @xmath75 tev is allowed for the mixing parameters @xmath51 and @xmath76 in the ranges of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "taking into account the constraints on @xmath73 , we take them as the free parameters in our numerical calculation .",
    "the numerical results are summarized in figs.(2 - 4 )     +    the relative correction @xmath78 is plotted in fig.2 as a function of the mixing parameter c for @xmath4=1 tev , @xmath79 and @xmath72 gev , in which @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the tree - level cross section of @xmath82 production predicted by the sm . from fig.2",
    ", we can see that the relative correction @xmath78 increases sharply when c approaches 0.45 .",
    "this is because in this range the mass of @xmath61 may equal to the @xmath83 energy @xmath10(800 gev ) which can make the large s -channel resonance effect in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the value of the relative correction varies in a wide range from a few percent to tens percent .",
    "there exists a special case that when @xmath84 , the heavy photon @xmath23 has no contribution to the process because the coupling of the @xmath23 to the electrons vanishs .",
    "+    to see the dependence of the relative correction on the parameter @xmath52 , in fig.3 , we plot @xmath78 as a function of the mixing parameter @xmath52 for f=1 tev , @xmath72 gev , and three values of the mixing parameter c. we can see that the relative correction decrease with the mixing parameter c increasing and is more sensitive to the parameter c. for @xmath85 , the value of @xmath78 is larger than @xmath86 , which might be detected in the future lc experiments .    in general , the contributions of the littlest higgs model to the observables are dependent on the factor @xmath87 . to see the effects of f and the higgs mass on the cross section , in fig 4 , we plot @xmath78 as a function of @xmath4 for three values of higgs mass(@xmath88 gev ) and take @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "one can see that the relative correction drops sharply with f increasing .",
    "for example , the relative correction is below @xmath91 when @xmath92 tev .",
    "this case is similar to the contributions of the littlest higgs model to other observables . on the other hand ,",
    "the curves show that the relative correction is not sensitive to the higgs boson mass .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in contrast to the electroweak correction , the correction of the littlest higgs model is positive .",
    "therefore , such significant positive correction is a definite signal of the new physics model .",
    "as has been mentioned above , the total cross section of @xmath0 can reach the order of 20 fb at the ilc .",
    "this cross section amounts to about @xmath93 events with the integrated luminosity of 1000 @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath94 statistical error corresponds to about @xmath95 precision .",
    "even we consider the systemic error of the ilc , the ilc can measure the cross section with a few percent precision@xcite and the relative correction of the littlest higgs model to the cross section is comparable to the ilc measurement precision .",
    "so , such correction might be detected at the ilc .",
    "the little higgs model , which can solve the hierarchy problem , is a promising alternative model of new physics beyond the standard model . among the various little higgs models ,",
    "the littlest higgs model is one of the simplest and phenomenologically viable models .",
    "the distinguishing feature of this model is the existence of the new scalars , the new gauge bosons , and the vector - like top quark .",
    "these new particles contribute to the experimental observables which could provide some clues of the existence of the littlest higgs model . in this paper",
    ", we study the potential to detect the contribution of the littlest higgs model via the process @xmath64 at the future @xmath9 experiments .    in the parameter spaces(@xmath75 tev , @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) limited by the electroweak precision data , we calculate the correction of the littlest higgs model to the cross section of the process @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the correction is significant even when we consider the constraint of electroweak precision data on the parameters .",
    "the contribution mainly comes from @xmath45-channel due to the high c.m . energy enhancing effect .",
    "but when @xmath51 approaches 0.45 , the mass of heavy @xmath61 can equal to the @xmath54 c.m .",
    "energy which can cause the resonance effect arising from s - channel @xmath61 propagator , and the correction sharply increases in this case .",
    "the relative correction varies from a few percent to tens percent .",
    "the littlest higgs model is a weak interaction theory and it is hard to detect its contributions and measure its couplings at the lhc . with the high c.m .",
    "energy and luminosity , the future ilc will open an ideal window to probe into the littlest higgs model and study its properties . in most case ,",
    "the relative correction of the littlest model to the process @xmath0 is large enough for people to measure the contribution of the model with the high precision at the ilc .",
