    "improved numerical tools and the increasing power of modern supercomputers have brought considerable progress in modeling stellar core collapse in the past years . it is possible now to simulate the complex physical processes in the deep interior of supernovae with unprecedented sophistication and detailedness .    it has become clear meanwhile that the explosions of massive stars are a generically multi - dimensional phenomenon .",
    "this insight was fostered by the fact that spherically symmetric ( 1d ) simulations , which became available with a fully energy dependent solution of the boltzmann transport problem for the neutrinos only recently ( see  @xcite for an overview and comparison of different numerical approaches ) confirmed and solidified older 1d results of the 1980 s and 1990 s , namely that explosions in the 1d models could not be obtained , neither by the prompt bounce - shock nor by the delayed neutrino - heating mechanism , at least not for progenitor stars of more than 10@xmath1 and on a timescale of roughly one second after core bounce  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the latest generation of multi - dimensional simulations has provided evidence for a variety of routes that can lead to explosions when nonradial phenomena are accounted for .",
    "these routes seem to depend on the properties and conditions in the progenitor stars like their mass and structure and the amount of angular momentum in their core .    in the following",
    "we will briefly review these recent developments in the multi - dimensional modeling of stellar core collapse and explosion , and we will critically discuss the status of the present simulations .",
    "a better understanding of the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae is not only important for interpreting the observable properties of the blast , for predicting gravitational - wave and neutrino signals , and for determining the conditions of nucleosynthesis processes that occur during the explosion .",
    "it is also and in particular essential for establishing the link between the progenitor stars and their compact remnants , thus answering questions like that of the mass distribution of neutron stars and of the stellar mass limit for black hole formation , which may happen either directly during the core collapse or by later massive fallback when the disrupted star does not become completely unbound during the explosion .",
    "so far , estimates for such scenarios have been made only on the basis of still rather crude self - consistent explosion simulations  @xcite or by invoking assumptions about the mass cut and energy in models with piston - driven artificial explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "due to the huge gravitational binding energy liberated in neutrinos , which carry away hundred times more energy than needed for the explosion , these particles have long been speculated to be the driving agent of the stellar explosion .",
    "colgate and white  @xcite in a seminal paper in 1966 not only proposed gravitational binding energy to be the primary energy source of core - collapse supernovae , but also that the intense flux of escaping neutrinos transfers the energy from the imploding core to the ejected stellar mantle .",
    "nearly twenty years later , bethe and wilson  @xcite were the first who described in detail the way how this might happen , interpeting thereby the physics that played a role in hydrodynamic simulations performed by wilson .",
    "they concluded that electron neutrino and antineutrino absorptions on the free neutrons and protons that are abundantly present in the shock - dissociated matter behind the stalled accretion shock in the supernova core , are the primary agents of the energy transfer .",
    "these pioneering computer simulations of the so - called delayed neutrino - driven explosion mechanism were still conducted in spherical symmetry .",
    "the mechanism turned out to be successful only when the neutron star was assumed to become a more luminous neutrino source by mixing instabilities accelerating the energy transport out of its dense interior .",
    "the thus enhanced neutrino emission led to stronger neutrino heating in the overlying layers of the exploding star .",
    "theoretical studies and multi - dimensional computer models , however , suggest that convection and mixing instabilities inside the neutron star do not have the necessary big effect ( see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "instead , the first multi - dimensional simulations , which became available only in the mid 1990 s , demonstrated that the neutrino - heated layer around the forming neutron star is unstable to vigorous convective overturn  @xcite .",
    "this can raise the efficiency of the neutrino energy deposition and thus can have a supportive effect on the supernova explosion .",
    "the first such two - dimensional ( i.e.  axisymmetric ) and three - dimensional simulations , however , suffered from a severe drawback : the physics of the neutrino transport and of neutrino - matter interactions , which is essential for discussing the power input to the explosion , is so complex that it could be treated only in a grossly simplified way . in the best models at that time",
    "this was done by the so - called `` grey diffusion approximation '' .",
    "this means that the energy - dependence of the neutrino interactions ( the cross sections of the most important neutrino processes typically scale with the squared neutrino energy ) was ignored and replaced by a `` grey '' ( spectrally averaged ) description .",
    "moreover , the spatial propagation was approximated by assuming that neutrinos diffuse through the dense neutron star medium until they decouple and stream away from a chosen position , usually from a layer somewhat outside of the `` neutrinosphere '' , close to the surface of the compact remnant .",
    "the historical development of these theoretical studies of the supernova explosion mechanism is resumed in a recent review  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]      recently , burrows et al .",
    "@xcite came up with the suggestion that supernovae might be energized by a strong flux of acoustic power originating from the neutron star . in their 2d simulations they found that the compact remnant is instigated to large - amplitude bipolar oscillations , @xmath2 core gravity modes , by the anisotropic accretion of gas .",
    "the pulsating compact remnant sends pressure waves into its environment , which carry a sizable energy flux and can even steepen into shocks , thus dissipating their energy in the surrounding medium and raising the entropy there .",
    "the ringing neutron star acts as a transducer that converts some part of the gravitational binding energy released by the accreted gas into sonic power .",
    "the radiated sound was found to be the crucial supply of the developing explosion with energy and momentum and thus triggers acoustically driven explosions .    while this appears as an interesting alternative to initiate the explosion",
    "if neutrino heating fails , the question is how the acoustic energy input compares to neutrino heating .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "@xcite reported that in their simulations the acoustic energy flux dominates the neutrino energy deposition later than several 100@xmath3ms after bounce .",
    "although we do not observe the large @xmath2 core g - modes in the neutron star seen by them at late post - bounce times , and on the basis of our present simulations we can neither judge nor exclude this possibility , also in our models in the full - scale supernova calculations for @xmath0815@xmath1 stars as well as in the parametric explosions we can clearly identify the presence of strong turbulence in the neutron star surface layer .",
    "the gas there is stirred by the violent impact of accretion downflows , thus creating vigorous sonic activity around the neutron star ( figs .",
    "[ janka_fig : waves1 ] and [ janka_fig : waves2 ] ) . very approximately",
    ", we can estimate the outgoing flux of sonic energy ( making the assumptions of spherical symmetry and negligible energy dissipation in the flow ) as  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fluid velocity in the sound waves , @xmath6 is the sound speed , and @xmath7 denotes the amplitude of the ripples on the background density @xmath8 caused by the sound waves .",
    "the numerical value in the last expression turns out to be fairly independent of radius and time at some distance from the neutron star in figs .",
    "[ janka_fig : waves1 ] and [ janka_fig : waves2 ] . for @xmath7 of order unity",
    "our estimate agrees with values quoted in burrows et al .",
    "@xcite , which might account for a sizable contribution to the energy of the developing explosion . in our simulations , we indeed see that the perturbations can reach such amplitudes , in particular when the downflow becomes unstable and the perturbations it generates in and around the neutron star surface layer grow . outside of these transient periods",
    ", however , @xmath7 is usually significantly smaller .",
    "moreover , the net neutrino energy deposition rates , integrated over the volume of the gain layer , in all of our simulations are typically several @xmath9erg / s ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dotenu ] ) , so that the energy input to the explosions in our models is clearly dominated by neutrinos .",
    "magnetohydrodynamically driven explosions have attracted renewed and increasing interest over the past years for a number of reasons one reason is the discovery of magnetars , which is taken as an indication that at least in some fraction of all cases very strong surface magnetic fields can be generated in neutron stars , possibly already during the evolution phases in which a supernova explosion is triggered .",
    "another reason is the established link of at least some long - duration gamma - ray bursts with very energetic and highly aymmetric hypernova explosions of presumably rapidly rotating massive stars . and",
    "a third reason is the interpretation of asymmetries observed in supernova explosions and supernova remnants as consequences and relics of jet - like eruptions or as hints to the ejection of highly collimated material .",
    "independent of how magnetic fields transfer energy to the explosion , e.g. , by hoop stresses , magnetic pressure , or viscous dissipation of energy , the initial magnetic fields in the stellar core must have been amplified during the collapse either by magnetic field wrapping or the magnetorotational instability .",
    "thus they tap the free energy that can be stored in the highly differential rotation of a spinning stellar core that collapses at angular momentum conserving conditions .",
    "this free energy , however , is typically a rather small fraction ( of order 10% ) of the total rotation energy , i.e. , @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the neutron star radius in @xmath12 cm and @xmath13 is the neutron star spin period .",
    "a millisecond neutron star typically requires the pre - collapse stellar core to rotate with a period of @xmath14 .",
    "this is significantly faster than predicted by current evolution models for rotating stars , in which the enhanced angular momentum loss due to angular momentum transport by magnetic field effects is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "at the onset of core collapse , the stellar cores are estimated to have spin periods of @xmath15s ( i.e. , @xmath16rad / s ) .",
    "this will lead to neutron stars with @xmath17ms , which is much too slow for rotation to be an energy reservoir of mhd - driven supernovae .",
    "such a conclusion was also reached on the basis of detailed simulations in refs .",
    "nevertheless , the mhd mechansim may still need to be invoked for explaining the enormous energy output of long - duration gamma - ray bursts and associated hypernova explosions , which would imply that these events are linked to rare cases where massive stars have achieved to retain a large angular momentum at the time when they end their lives as collapsars  @xcite .",
    "we have reviewed a variety of recent findings that shed new light on the processes that cause the explosions of massive stars and play a role during the birth of neutron stars .",
    "all recent 2d simulations that were performed with a full 180 degree grid agree that the standing accretion shock becomes unstable to low - mode , nonradial deformation .",
    "this sasi phenomenon plays a very important role in the supernova core .",
    "it was not only found to induce a large asymmetry of the developing blast but also to facilitate neutrino - driven explosions by stretching the time accreted matter can stay in the gain layer and can be exposed to neutrino heating .",
    "moreover , the sasi was observed to excite large - amplitude core g - modes in the neutron star , whose sonic damping could contribute to or be essential for powering the explosion .",
    "the asymmetries imprinted on the explosion by the sasi may lateron lead to neutron star kicks and might explain the observed velocities of young pulsars . in three dimensions",
    "the @xmath18 modes of the sasi can also have an influence on the spin of the forming neutron star  @xcite .    despite the general agreement about the importance of the sasi ,",
    "the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon is still a matter of vivid debate ( see  @xcite and references therein ) and the present calculations differ in many conclusions .",
    "partly this is may be so because of the significantly different numerical approaches taken , e.g. , regarding the hydrodynamics and neutrino transport , the computational grid , the description of gravity , and the employed equation of state and neutrino interactions .",
    "some of the current discrepancies and controversies , however , will find an explanation when more simulations become available and comparisons are made . ultimately , however , most of the processes and consequences mentioned above will have to be addressed by 3d models , which are currently still out of reach because of the enormous computational demands of the energy - dependent neutrino transport .",
