    "in recent years , the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) @xcite , an important tool in theoretical physics , has attracted much attention in the context of quantum information science .",
    "it has been found that the ybe is closely related to the generation of quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "furthermore a new quantum computation model based on the notion of integrability was proposed , where the quantum gates are related to unitary solutions of the ybe @xcite .    formally , the ybe is expressed by ,    ,    where @xmath0 , @xmath1 , are called spectral parameters , or rapidities as they may also have a kinematical interpretation , and the @xmath2-matrix acts on a product space @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the above equation provides a sufficient condition for quantum integrability and leads to a consistent and systematic method to construct integrable models .    in the quantum computing framework",
    "the r - matrix corresponds to a quantum gate @xcite , but this operator and the ybe may also have several other physical interpretations . in @xmath4-dimensional quantum field theory / scattering theory",
    "the ybe means that the process of 3-particle scattering is reduced to a sequence of pairwise collisions which do not depend on the time ordering of the 2-body collisions @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath2 is interpreted as the two - body scattering matrix ( usually denoted @xmath5-matrix ) and the yang - baxter equation has the name of  factorization equation \" . in vertex models of classical statistical physics , the yang - baxter equation appears as a condition for the vertex weights @xmath2 which allows for the exact solution of the corresponding model @xcite . in this context",
    "it is usually referred as a  star - triangle \" relation , interestingly inspired in a work of 1899 by a brooklyn engineer , kennelly , on electric networks , using kirchhoff s laws @xcite . on a more recent note",
    ", there has been a considerable increase of investigation of these structures related to quantum integrability due to several new exact results that are playing an important role in the progress of our understanding of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning , in addition , the interest raised by the realization of integrable systems , in ultracold physics . @xcite .    another useful way to write the ybe is obtained by applying a permutation operator , @xmath6 , to the @xmath2-matrix , such that , @xmath7 assuming that the @xmath2-matrix satisfies the so called difference property @xcite and by a simple transformation of the spectral parameters @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , it is possible to find a multiplicative form for the ybe ,    .",
    "the interest in this form comes from its relation to the braid group which has been recently linked to topological quantum computation @xcite and a scheme for its verification through an optical setup has been proposed @xcite and achieved @xcite .    therefore , due to the importance of the ybe to physics and quantum information processing ( qip ) and the increasing possibility of an experimental approach in solvable systems @xcite , direct quantum simulations of the ybe ought to be investigated .",
    "it is widely accepted in qip that the development of large scale quantum processors depends broadly on two basic issues : i ) the construction of systems containing a large number of qubits and ( ii ) the ability to control their quantum states , and implement correction protocols to prevent decoherence caused by unavoidable interactions with the environment .",
    "so far , nmr has been one of the leading techniques to demonstrate those aspects in small systems .",
    "in fact , the development of special pulse engineering techniques has allowed nmr to be applied to qip with great success , with experimental demonstrations of different quantum protocols and algorithms in liquid and solid - state samples , including error - correction protocols @xcite .",
    "nmr quantum information processors provide a good testbed for qip tasks , such as demonstrating quantum algorithms @xcite , fundamental physics studies such as delayed choice @xcite , quantum tunneling @xcite , quantum dynamics @xcite and pt symmetries @xcite , and the present experiment in the yang - baxter equation .",
    "nmr implementations have , as well , already provided a certain number of observations linked in various ways to particular solvable systems@xcite , and in a wider way to quantum integrable systems @xcite .    here",
    "we follow the route of investigating this core relation behind quantum integrable systems , which we do by means of an nmr interferometric experiment as a tool to directly quantum simulate the ybe .",
    "the present demonstration of the ybe through qip and nmr is the first one using this technique and opens up a way to implement quantum entanglement with integrability .",
    "nmr implementations of quantum information processors are usually executed in an ensemble of identical and non - interacting molecules at room temperature , where nuclear spins are employed as qubits . to implement quantum information in such systems ,",
    "we need to prepare , from the thermal equilibrium state , the state :    @xmath10    this state is a mixture of the pure state @xmath11 and the maximally mixed state @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dimension of the quantum system and @xmath14 is the thermal polarization of the system . since the maximally mixed part does not produce observable signal , the overall nmr signal arises only from the pure state part @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the observed signal from a nmr system in the above state ( [ pps ] ) , called a pseudo - pure state ( pps ) , is equivalent to that from a system in a pure state , except that the pps signal strength is reduced by a factor @xmath15 .",
    "we need to cast the ybe in a suitable form for our nmr verification",
    ". this can be done through its relation to braiding relations , emerging for instance from the exchange of anyons @xcite ,    [ braidgroup ] & _ j _ k=_k _ j , |j - k|2 + & _ j_j^-1=_j^-1_j + & _ j_j+1_j=_j+1_j_j+1 .",
    "the operators @xmath16 are the braid group generators .",
    "the ybe for @xmath17 matrices , in the so- called braid limit , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 , coincides with the braid relation in eqs .",
    "( [ braidgroup ] ) .",
    "this is better seen using the notation @xmath20 acting on a product of vector spaces , @xmath17 acts on the spaces indexed @xmath21 and the identities on the other spaces , in the braid limit @xmath22 furnishes a representation of the braid group @xcite . the r - matrix that we need",
    "is obtained below .",
    "first we remind @xcite that one can obtain two braid operations , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , acting on a two - dimensional topological basis , such that @xmath23 acts as @xmath25 and @xmath24 as @xmath26 , their respective matrix representation is    [ ab ] & a = e^- (    cc1 & 0 + 0 &    ) ; b= (    cc1 + & 1- + 1- & 1 +    ) ,    here , @xmath27 is the imaginary number .",
    "the braiding relation for these matrices is @xmath28 , in the two - dimensional basis .",
    "it is possible to generalize the above relation following a yang - baxterization @xcite procedure in order to introduce spectral parameters in a four - dimensional r - matrix that can be reduced to a two - dimensional one containing spectral parameters .",
    "it consists of writing the r - matrix as    ( u)=a(u ) + b(u ) t ,    more explicitly , in the usual notation ,    & ( u)_12=a_1(u ) + b_1(u ) t_12 + & ( u)_23=a_2(u ) + b_2(u ) t_23 ,    and we are interested in the case @xmath29 such that these scalar functions must be consistent with the ybe , also @xmath30 satisfies the so called temperley - lieb algebra @xcite relations , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the action of @xmath34 on the two - dimensional basis @xcite leads to the definition of the spectral parameter dependent @xmath35 and @xmath36 by , respectively , the matrix elements of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "consistency with the ybe provides @xmath39 , a normalization factor , and @xmath40 $ ] ( where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 being the light speed ) .",
    "then , introducing the transformation ,    e^-2;(u)e^ ,    one can write , in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) , two - dimensional matrices    [ aa ] & a(u)a ( ) = e^-i ( 2 ) i_z , + & b(u)b ( ) = e^i ( 2 ) i_x ,    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 , such that the operators are written in a form which is appropriate for nmr operations . then the ybe we need is ,    [ yb2de ] a(_1)b(_2)a(_3)=b(_3)a(_2)b(_1 ) .    the angle parameters which are the spectral parameters ( or rapidities )",
    "must satisfy the following kinematical consistency relation    [ angles ] ( _ 2 ) = .",
    "thus , in the nmr implementation , the operators ( [ aa ] ) act on the ground states and excited states of the nuclear spin states , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , which are used as qubits .",
    "in other words , one maps a two - dimensional invariant space on the two - level nuclear states of our sample .",
    "our experiment was performed on a liquid state iodotrifluoroethylene sample .",
    "this contains molecules with three qubits , which are encoded in the @xmath48 spin-@xmath49 nuclei ( see figure [ iodotrifluoroethylene ] ) .",
    "the phase decoherence times @xmath50 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are approximately 0.08s , 0.09s and 0.08s , respectively .",
    "the first step of the experiment consists of preparing , from thermal equilibrium , the pps ( [ pps ] ) with @xmath54 , which correspond to a situation where all spins are on its ground state , for a pps preparation we use the controlled - transfer gates technique @xcite .",
    "after the initialization in the pps we can perform the experiment for the verification of the yang - baxter equation , the scheme of the experiment is shown in figure [ iodotrifluoroethylene ] . in the first step a @xmath55 pulse about @xmath56 axis is applied on qubits one and three , yielding to the three - qubit state @xmath57 . in the next step , the left - hand - side and the right - hand - side of the 2d ybe ( [ yb2de ] ) are applied on qubits one and three , respectively . by using eq .",
    "( [ aa ] ) , after some manipulation the 2d ybe can be brought to a sequence of single spin rotations , which is the sequence implemented in the experiment .",
    "the qubits one and three in the output states are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively ( see figure [ iodotrifluoroethylene ] ) . to verify the ybe we need to measure the overlap @xmath60 ,",
    "if this quantity is equal to 1 , then @xmath61 and the ybe is satisfied , otherwise the ybe is not satisfied . to perform such verification",
    "we explore a quantum interferometric approach based on the controlled - swap gate that can extract properties of quantum states without quantum tomography @xcite . in this approach",
    "( see the final step in figure [ iodotrifluoroethylene ] ) the second qubit of our system is taken as a auxiliary qubit . after transforming the auxiliary qubit to the state @xmath62 , by a @xmath55 rotation about @xmath56 axis , a controlled - swap gate with the second qubit as control is applied . when a measurement is performed on the auxiliary , its normalized complex magnetization on the plane",
    "is directly related to the overlap between the states of the swapped qubits @xmath63 @xcite .        in figure [ correctangle ]",
    "we show the results for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 varying from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , in all cases the relation in ( [ angles ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the histogram displays the distribution of the normalized total magnetizations of the auxiliary qubits .",
    "an average magnetization is @xmath69 , showing the validity of the 2d ybe with good agreement .",
    "we also explore the cases where ( [ angles ] ) is not satisfied . in figure [ anglet](a ) we show the results for @xmath70 and @xmath71 varying from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , these angle parameters do not satisfy the relation in ( [ angles ] ) except for @xmath72 and @xmath68 . in figure [ anglet](b ) we show the case where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and when @xmath71 changes between @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in this case",
    "ybe is not satisfied except for @xmath75 .",
    "using nmr techniques developed in the realm of quantum information processing we were able to experimentally verify the ybe . in order to achieve this",
    "we map a two - dimensional invariant space , related to a topological basis and anyon behavior , on the two - level nuclear states of our sample . in our verification",
    "we explored a quantum interferometric approach based on the controlled - swap gate , a procedure that can extract properties of quantum states without quantum tomography . the present two - dimensional approach to investigate the ybe by means of nmr opens up a way to realize the four - dimensional case , which , differently from the present case , will necessarily involve bell states , and reveal the possibility to implement quantum entanglement with integrability .",
    "the issue of nmr entanglement is quite interesting and has been broadly discussed in the literature @xcite . since the results of @xcite , nmr has demonstrated in a series of experiments its capability to produce quantum correlations , including entangled behaviour of qubits and their importance in quantum metrology @xcite and quantum simulations @xcite have been investigated . the control over state creation and unitary manipulation , combined with the possibility of extending the number of qubits @xcite unlocks new possibilities to the applications of nmr - qip to the study of ybe .",
    "therefore , in order to carry out the four - dimensional case in an nmr setup one needs to deal with a higher number of qubits .",
    "we are currently doing investigations in this direction and we believe that , as in the present work , the interweaving between quantum integrability and quantum information , as well as its relation with many - body , quantum fields and statistical physics , will unveil new and interesting patterns .",
    "for the yang - baxter experiment presented in this work we have used a varian @xmath76 mhz spectrometer and a double resonance probe - head equipped with a magnetic field gradient coil .",
    "the three spin-@xmath49 @xmath48 nuclei of iodotrifluoroethylene ( @xmath77 ) molecule , dissolved in deuterated acetone , were used as qubits .",
    "the experiment has been performed at room temperature .",
    "the nuclear spins of the fluorine interact with the static magnetic field and with each other via a ising - like model .",
    "the natural hamiltonian of our system is described by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 being , respectively , the nuclear spin operator in @xmath81direction and the larmor frequency of the spin @xmath82 ( @xmath83 is the pauli matrix ) ; @xmath84 are the couplings .",
    "@xmath85 is the radio - frequency ( rf ) hamiltonian employed to control the qubits .",
    "the physical parameters of our molecule are shown in figure[iodotrifluoroethylene ] .",
    "now we display in more detail the complexity of the sequence of unitary operations used in the experiment and shown in the quantum circuit in figure [ iodotrifluoroethylene ] , where time runs from left to right . in order to prepare the initial state and run the protocols necessary for the experiment we have used the nmr tools that were available .",
    "they were the rf pulses and pulsed field gradients .",
    "the later is a gradient magnetic field applied along the @xmath86 direction causing an inhomogeneity in the static magnetic field .",
    "this gradient removes the coherences leading the system to a mixed state . from",
    "that new coherent states can be prepared by applying rf pulses . to prepare the initial state we have used the controlled - transfer gates methods @xcite , the pulse sequence is presented in figure [ initialstate ] .",
    "the yang - baxter protocol was implemented using the sequence presented in figure [ yangbaxterps ] . for the controlled - swap gate at the end of the quantum circuit we have used the following pulse sequence presented in figure [ conswap ] .            to implement the operations we exploit standard isech shaped pulses and numerically optimized grape pulses @xcite .",
    "the grape pulses are optimized to be robust to radio - frequency inhomogeneities and chemical shift variations . for combining all operations into a single pulse sequence we have used the techniques described in @xcite .",
    "we built a computer program , similar to the nmr quantum compiler used in the 7 qubits nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "the program minimizes the effects of finite pulsewidth , off - resonance errors and unwanted coupling evolutions .    99    yang , c. n. some exact results for the many - body problem in one dimension with repulsive delta - function interaction .",

    "<S> the yang - baxter equation is an important tool in theoretical physics , with many applications in different domains that span from condensed matter to string theory . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the interest on the equation has increased due to its connection to quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the yang - baxter equation is closely related to quantum entanglement and quantum computation . therefore , owing to the broad relevance of this equation , besides theoretical studies , it also became significant to pursue its experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> here , we show an experimental realization of the yang - baxter equation and verify its validity through a nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) interferometric setup . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment was performed on a liquid state iodotrifluoroethylene sample which contains molecules with three qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we use controlled - transfer gates that allow us to build a pseudo - pure state from which we are able to apply a quantum information protocol that implements the yang - baxter equation . </S>"
