    ", experimental data determine @xmath7 without recourse to model - specific assumptions .",
    "this procedure has several sources of uncertainty .",
    "first , the identity @xmath19 receives both perturbative corrections and corrections suppressed by the heavy @xmath20 and @xmath21 quark masses .",
    "the former are known to order @xmath22",
    "@xcite , with unknown higher - order corrections likely less than 1% , but the latter depend on four subleading isgur - wise functions and have been estimated only with phenomenological models and quenched lattice qcd .",
    "another source of error is the extrapolation of measured form factors to zero recoil , where the rates vanish .",
    "linear fits of @xmath23 underestimate the zero - recoil value by about 3% , an effect mostly due to the curvature  @xcite .",
    "using non - linear shapes for @xmath23 reduces this error , and therefore constraints on second and higher derivatives at zero - recoil are welcome .",
    "dispersive constraints  @xcite relate second and sometimes higher derivatives to the first and are commonly used .",
    "hqet sum rules provide a complementary way of constraining the @xmath23 shapes .",
    "new sum rules for the curvature and higher derivatives of the isgur - wise function were derived in refs .",
    "@xcite . equating the result of inserting a complete set of intermediate states in the nonforward matrix element of a time - ordered product of hqet currents with the operator product expansion ( ope )",
    "gives a generic sum rule depending on the products of the velocities of the initial , final , and intermediate states .",
    "these are denoted respectively by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( the intermediate states all have the same velocity @xmath26 in the infinite - mass limit ) , and the products are denoted by @xmath27 or generically @xmath28 . these parameters are constrained to lie within the range  @xcite @xmath29 and differentiating the generic sum rule with respect to them at @xmath30 ( read : @xmath31 ) produces a class of sum rules for derivatives of the isgur - wise function at zero recoil . the sum rules of refs .",
    "@xcite were derived at tree level in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "the present paper includes the order @xmath6 corrections to the new sum rules and uses them to derive bounds on the curvatures of @xmath23 including @xmath6 and @xmath32 corrections . including these corrections to the heavy - quark limit",
    "is important for meaningful comparison with data and dispersive constraints .",
    "the derivation of the generic sum rule follows a well - known formalism  @xcite .",
    "it begins with the consideration of the time - ordered product of two arbitrary heavy - heavy currents @xmath33 as a complex function of @xmath34 at fixed @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the minimum possible energy of the charmed hadronic state that @xmath37 can create at fixed @xmath35 .",
    "the currents have the form @xmath38 for any dirac matrices @xmath39 .",
    "only the choices @xmath40 and @xmath41 are explored here , but in principle others lead to different sum rules .",
    "the @xmath8 states are ground state @xmath13 or @xmath42 mesons and have the standard relativistic normalization . as in the derivation of the uraltsev sum rule  @xcite , the initial and final states do not necessarily have the same velocity .",
    "considering the _ nonforward _ matrix element of the time - ordered product is a crucial generalization in deriving the new sum rules  @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ tfi ] ) one proceeds by splitting up the two time - orderings and inserting complete sets of intermediate charm states .",
    "the result is @xmath43 where the sums include phase space factors such as @xmath44 .",
    "again , @xmath45 has been written as above to call attention to the full generality possible for deriving sum rules by this method , but here both @xmath46 and @xmath47 will be taken to be @xmath13 mesons to avoid the considerable complication of the @xmath42 polarization .",
    "in addition , hqet states and currents will be used henceforth since the goal is sum rules for the derivatives of the isgur - wise function . deriving the bounds in the effective theory",
    "also makes the calculation of perturbative corrections much easier .    the function @xmath48 has two cuts along the real axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ contour ] .",
    "the important one here , running from @xmath49 to the origin , comes from the first time - ordering and corresponds to intermediate states with a @xmath21 quark or a @xmath21 quark , a @xmath20 quark , and a @xmath50 quark .",
    "the cut associated with the other time - ordering begins near @xmath51 and corresponds to states with two @xmath20 quarks and a @xmath52 quark . since @xmath48 is perturbatively calculable only when smeared over a large enough range of @xmath53  @xcite , it is multiplied by a weight function @xmath54 and integrated around the contour shown in the figure .",
    "the scale @xmath55 gives the extent of the smearing and therefore should be well above @xmath56 .",
    "the contour chosen eliminates all but the intermediate states with heavy quark content @xmath21 by avoiding the second cut and pinching the first at @xmath57 . crossing the contour assumes local duality at the scale @xmath58 , but",
    "if @xmath59 the weight function will be quite small here",
    ". this will be clear with the specific weight function used below .     in the complex @xmath53 plane .",
    "the depicted contour picks up only contributions from the left - hand cut , which corresponds to physical states with a charm quark .",
    "the states given by the right - hand cut do not contribute here.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    assuming it is analytic in the shaded region of fig .",
    "[ contour ] , the result is @xmath60 where the delta function has been used to perform the phase - space integral and the hqet state normalization convention has been used to eliminate mass factors in the denominator .",
    "the intermediate @xmath61 states carry four - momentum @xmath62 .",
    "choice of the weight function is governed by well - known concerns  @xcite . in practice",
    "one uses @xmath63 , which is the @xmath64 limit of the set of functions @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "but since the weight function must be analytic within the contour , the use of these is strictly correct only for small @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the poles at @xmath68{-1}\\,\\delta$ ] are a distance of order @xmath55 away from the cut , and the contour can be deformed away without getting too close to the cut and relying on local duality at a scale below @xmath58 .",
    "this is not true of the @xmath69 limit , in which the poles approach the cut and the contour must pinch the cut at the scale @xmath55 instead of @xmath58 .",
    "this is a problem because the contribution at @xmath55 is weighted much more heavily than that at @xmath58 , and thus the results will depend more strongly on the assumption of local duality .",
    "however , an explicit calculation shows that the results here do not depend on @xmath70 , just as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found in their derivation of corrections to the bjorken sum rule .",
    "this is not true in other cases , such as the voloshin sum rule  @xcite .",
    "the weight function in what follows can therefore be considered a simple step function excluding states with excitation energies greater than @xmath55 .",
    "although increasing @xmath55 includes more states and weakens the bounds , the cutoff energy must be chosen large enough to make perturbative qcd appropriate .",
    "choosing @xmath71 gev should therefore be sufficient .",
    "the sum rule is derived by performing an operator product expansion on the time - ordered product of currents on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ preope ] ) while writing out the right - hand side explicitly in terms of excited - state isgur - wise functions .",
    "the leading - order ope relevant for @xmath8 matrix elements consists of a single dimension - three operator , @xmath72 .",
    "higher dimension operators will be neglected here , as they give corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath73 or @xmath32 .",

    "therefore , the function analogous to @xmath78 including perturbative corrections of all orders will still vanish in these limits .",
