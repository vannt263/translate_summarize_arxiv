    "the richness of intermingled basins property and the non - uniqueness of the srb measures together with topological transitivity is a nice phenomenon .",

    "we show that either a weak hyperbolic transitivity or any weak hyperbolic pre - transitivity is enough to achieve the srb uniqueness property for endomorphisms . by a weak hyperbolic transitivity we mean the existence of a non - uniformely hyperbolic dense total orbit and by pre - transitivity , we mean the density of the total orbit of a periodic point which may commonly occurs for endomorphisms . by a total orbit @xmath5 we simply mean the set of all images and pre - images of a point in the phase space .",

    "our intension is to show that by a weak hyperbolic transitivity ( which in case can be a weaker condition than the mixing property ) one may obtain the uniqueness of srb measures . in other words",
    "we can say that the non - robustness property of kan - type examples on boundary - less manifolds have relation to their non - robustness of weak hyperbolic transitivity . in this direction , the recent work of c. bonatti and r. potrie @xcite is valuable since in a partially hyperbolic setting with mostly contracting dominated splitting , they construct examples of 3-dimensional torus with infinitely many intermingled basins and mixing property .",
    "their construction does not work in a non - uniformly hyperbolic setting of our type .",

    "they also concluded continuity results about the number of physical measures .",
    "once working at the world of diffeomorphisms , the notion of a hyperbolic periodic point is well defined .",

    "once defining a homoclinic relation between different periodic points by a transversality condition along their stable and unstable sets , then this same stable - sub bundle property of a total orbit of @xmath6 may help us to make relation between periodic points .    the first version of following theorem was proved under the condition of a general pre - transitivity of a point , but due to the dichotomy of transitivity @xcite",

    "whenever being in a conservative setting , it bears the stable ergodicity .",
    "in this section we try to mention class of examples which the main theorem may apply .",
    "we see the uniqueness of srb measures or exact number of srb measures for some known examples using above theorems and give a deliberation on their statistic stability or ergodic stability in case the srb measure is the lebesgue measure .      according to @xcite , @xcite on one hand endomorphisms",

    "we can consider two such examples and glue them to find a local diffeomorphism of @xmath336 admitting two srb measures also with topological transitivity but not robustly anymore . in paper @xcite",

    ". not being a measure transitive here plus the hyperbolicity means that you will not find any hyperbolic point which belongs to both of the basins of attractions . whereas it is a well - known fact that kan examples does not have a mixing property",
