    "the measured oscillations parameters ( best value : @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) are deduced : from the deficit and the distortion of the zenith angle distribution of up throughgoing @xmath18 ( @xmath19 @xmath20 ) @xcite ; from the measured deficit of lower energy partially contained events@xcite .",
