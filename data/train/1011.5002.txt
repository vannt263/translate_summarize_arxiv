    "the ability to load ultracold quantum degenerate gases into periodic or quasi - periodic potentials of different geometries , created by optical lattices @xcite has opened the way to realization of well known condensed matter systems with atoms of fermionic @xcite and bosonic character @xcite .",
    "such model systems allow us to gain deeper understanding of the fundamental problems in many body physics beyond the weak coupling , mean - field regime , such as transition between superfluid and mott - insulator @xcite . in the strongly interacting regime ,",
    "new phenomena can emerge , such as quantum magnetism @xcite and the supersolid phase @xcite .",
    "in general , these emergent phenomena belong to the class of quantum phase transitions and their mechanisms are strongly dependent both on the geometry of the lattice and the interaction between the atoms loaded into the lattice .",
    "the theoretical and experimental studies of these effects in large many - sites lattice systems are important both from the fundamental and applied points of view .",
    "for example , the physics of ultracold lattice systems where frustration can occur , is fundamental for the development of fault tolerant systems and is important for quantum computing @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the possibility to address atoms in single sites @xcite and to create mixtures of bosons and fermions @xcite draws the attention to the study of finite , inhomogeneous systems @xcite with complex inter - species interactions .",
    "the study of such two- or three - dimensional systems enables understanding of basic physics of more complicated systems , such as interaction - dependent properties of ground states ( such as frustrations ) and the role of symmetry breaking in transitions between different quantum phases .",
    "small , strongly correlated systems may also lend themselves to the process of controlled quantum state preparation and manipulation making it potentially useful in quantum information , quantum - limited measurements , and atomtronics @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a minimal finite two - dimensional lattice model , namely a three - site ring of a bose - fermi ultracold mixture .",
    "such a three - site system may be realized experimentally by engineering magnetic microtraps on an atomic chip , or by combining a harmonic potential with a triangular or kagome lattice , as suggested in @xcite . with the small number of atoms , this system lends itself to the bose - fermi - hubbard model solvable by means of direct diagonalization .",
    "we consider the ground state of the system and investigate how the admixture of fermions leads to various phases , depending on the filling factor and inter - species interaction strength . in particular , we consider unusual insulating phases resulting from the inter - species interaction , which is connected to the existence of macroscopic self - trapping states in the mean - field regime @xcite .",
    "based on the standard bose - fermi hubbard model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the hamiltonian for the three - site ring can be written as follows : @xmath0 where , @xmath1 here @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the bosons and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the fermions ; the number operators are : @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",

    "it can be seen that the system exhibits a rich phase diagram with an asymmetric behavior depending on the sign of the inter - species interaction and the number of bosons .    for the case of attraction between bosons and fermions , @xmath46 , a new insulating phase corresponding to the ground state @xmath17 ( fig .",

[ states ] ] . in the mean - field picture @xcite",
    "this behavior reflects the fact that the effective interaction - induced potential seen by the fermion is weak and completely symmetric . as one increases @xmath54 ,",

    "in contrast to the regular insulating phase , the bosonic insulating phases that arise purely due to the inter - species interaction and correspond to symmetry - broken states ( e.g. , @xmath17 or @xmath14 ) , naturally give rise to the regions of suppressed tunneling of the fermion .    to characterize the interaction - induced insulating phases further",
    ", we look at the boson number fluctuations in the system given by @xmath60 , see fig.[phase_com](d ) .",

    "it has been noted ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that for a few - particle pure bosonic system at incommensurate filling a small superfluid fraction is always present , therefore no insulating state can occur .",
    "we find that this is indeed the case in our system with no fermions ( or @xmath48 ) .",
    "the insulating phases in this case occur only in the presence of fermions , with non - zero inter - species interaction strength .",
    "for the repulsive inter - species interaction the insulating phase at large @xmath24 is suppressed , as shown in fig .",

    "for inter - species attraction both the regular mi - like insulating region at large @xmath66 and the insulating region at lower values of @xmath24 are retained due to the inter - species interaction . as in the case of commensurate filling , at large @xmath24",
    "the new insulating domains that appear due to the inter - species interaction are dominated by the ground state configuration @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ states_inc ] . in general , both for incommensurate and commensurate filling of bosons the boundaries of the insulating regions are pushed to larger interaction strength values as one increases the number of bosons .    in striking difference from the commensurate case , the tunneling of fermions is almost completely suppressed in the attractive inter - species interaction region , @xmath46 [ see fig . [ phase_inc](b ) ] .",
    "for repulsive inter - species interaction , @xmath53 , the fermion gains mobility as one increases the boson interaction strength , @xmath24 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for larger @xmath24 and repulsive inter - species interaction , the insulating phase is dominated by the state @xmath30 in fig .",

    "the fermion is delocalized as in the commensurate case .",

    "therefore , the results presented above are also applicable to a mixture of two bosonic species ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with a single atom in one of the components . in the case of @xmath68 ,",
    "the bose - fermi - hubbard model is still valid for the fermion filling factor less than @xmath69 ( the system with no fermions is equivalent to the system with three fermions ) , and the fermion statistics influences the ground state configuration . in particular , the system is particle - hole symmetric for @xmath70 and @xmath71 filling of fermions .",
    "this fact is reflected in the behavior of the phase diagram , so that the case of @xmath70 fermion filling with repulsive inter - species interactions corresponds to the case of @xmath71 fermion filling with attractive inter - species interaction . for example , in the case of @xmath71 filling of fermions",

    "[ 2fermions ] .",
    "other characteristic properties of the system , such as the behaviour of the fermion tunneling correlations and bosonic number fluctuations , are qualitatively the same as for @xmath21 .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the ground state of a small - scale system of quantum degenerate bosons and fermions in a three - site ring configuration .",
    "we have restricted the consideration to the fermion filling factor less or equal than one , which as allowed us to employ a standard bose - fermi - hubbard hamiltonian . by examining the tunneling correlations and particle fluctuations in the system ,",
    "we have found that the system admits mobile and insulating states that are analogous to the superfluid and mott - insulator states in infinite lattices . the novel insulating states identified in this small - scale system for both commensurate and incommensurate filling of bosons , are purely due to the inter - species interactions , and can be controlled by controlling the interaction strengths and the number of fermions injected into the system .      99 i. bloch , nature physics * 1 * , 23 ( 2005 ) .",
