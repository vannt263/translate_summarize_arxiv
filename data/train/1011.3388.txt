    ", we can mention for instance cumn @xcite , feau @xcite , feal @xcite , fenimn @xcite and femnal @xcite alloys .",
    "these alloys are interesting due to the richness of magnetic phases that can be found such as ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic , superparamagnetic , cluster glass , sg and rsg depending on stoichiometry , microstructure , degree of dilution , atomic disorder , magnetic field and temperature .",
    "typical ising spin glass systems like those based on femntio@xmath5 @xcite , fe(cu , al)dy @xcite , lihoyf @xcite , feal @xcite and femnal @xcite are good candidates to study sg and rsg related properties through ising - based theoretical models where good agreement with experimental results has been achieved . in particular , pure sg and rsg behaviors , in ternary femnal alloys , arise from several ingredients including random atomic distribution of the alloy constituent elements in the crystalline structure , dilution provided by al atoms giving rise to bond randomness and , finally , competition among the different exchange integrals involved . on this",
    "last respect , competition is given , essentially , by the difference in sign and magnitude of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 exchange integrals .",
    "for high enough iron contents , a rsg behavior within the ferromagnetic phase governed by the fe matrix can arise @xcite .",
    "+ up to date , works reported on these kind of alloys deal with magnetic properties under bulk conditions .",
    "however , to our knowledge , and despite of all the literature related with the so - called surface spin glass - like behavior in nanoparticles , no studies on metallic nanoparticles having concurrently bond competition , magnetic dilution and atomic disorder within the entire volume of the nanoparticles have been reported .",
    "this fact has led us to consider the interplay between these effects and those arising from finite size when considering nanoparticles having such ingredients .",
    "the purpose of this article is to characterize from the magnetic standpoint , how the sg behaviors , found in systems like femnal alloys under bulk conditions , become revealed in nanoparticles where the surface to volume ratio becomes increasingly important .",
    "both the free energy variational method based on the bogoliubov inequality and a metropolis monte carlo simulation in the framework of a nearest neighbor ising model were considered .",
    "the former , as energy minimization tool , has been already successfully employed in describing the magnetic properties of this kind of systems where theoretical magnetic phase diagrams are in good agreement with the experimental ones @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "several features lead us to consider an ising model : i ) magnetic frustration can be better resolved with an ising model than , for instance , with continuous spin models @xcite , ii ) it is in agreement with the framework we are interested in , which consists of iron - based nanoparticles with a very high effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy and where , despite of having cubic structure , a single easy axis can be experimentally induced @xcite , iii ) it has been already used in similar systems and quite good agreement with experimental data ( magnetometric measurements and hyperfine fields from mssbauer spectroscopy ) has been achieved @xcite , and finally iv ) it allows to keep computational requirements under reasonable limits . thus , our model is based on the following @xmath9 spins ising hamiltonian : @xmath10 the first sum runs over nearest neighbors @xmath11 , and @xmath12 takes on the values @xmath13 or @xmath14 depending on whether the @xmath15 site is occupied by a magnetic atom ( fe , mn ) or an aluminum one , respectively . the exchange integral @xmath16 obeys the following probability distribution function accounting for disorder and the different couplings involved @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , are the fractional concentrations of fe , mn and al atoms , respectively .",
    "the terms @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the probabilities of having nearest neighbors fe - fe , fe - mn and mn - mn bonds , respectively , and interacting through the corresponding exchange integrals @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath25 . here , @xmath6 , hereafter simply @xmath26 , was set to 12.846 mev only for pure iron nanoparticles with body - centered cubic ( bcc ) structure , and was set to 16.872 mev for fe@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2 nanoparticles having the same structure .",
    "these values reproduce the curie critical temperatures of the corresponding systems under bulk conditions and the difference among them is attributed to the presence of both mn and al atoms and to the fact that fe and fe@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2 have different lattice parameters @xcite .",
    "additionally , for the alloy , the remaining exchange integrals were set to @xmath7=@xmath27 and @xmath25=@xmath28 with @xmath29=0.005 and @xmath30 = 0.03 , @xcite and they correspond to the so - called competitive parameters . in this work ,",
    "such values are kept fixed regardless the size of the nanoparticles to be considered .",
    "the last coefficient @xmath31 stands for diluted bonds , with @xmath16=0 , corresponding to nearest neighbors al - al , al - mn and al - fe pairs . finally , the second term in eq.([1 ] ) is the zeeman contribution dealing with the coupling of the spins with a uniform external applied magnetic field @xmath32 .",

    "@xcite , in the pairs - approximation , the system is considered as formed by @xmath33 single spins ( s ) and @xmath34 linked pairs ( p ) of spins with a total number of spins @xmath35 .",
    "additionally , it is assumed that the magnetization can be obtained either from single spins or spins belonging to a pair .",

    "here , the first sum runs over single spins and the second sum runs over pairs .",
    "both hamiltonians , eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , can be related through the variational approach based on the bogoliubov inequality : @xmath39 \\leq \\left[f_{0}\\right ] +   \\left[\\left\\langle   { \\cal h } - { \\cal h}_{0 } \\right\\rangle_{0}\\right]\\equiv \\left[\\phi\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the helmholtz free energy defined by @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the free energy defined by @xmath43 ; @xmath44 refers to the thermal average in the ensemble defined by @xmath43 , whereas @xmath45 $ ] represents a configurational average in which atomic disorder is considered .",
    "according to the way as the system has been figured out we have : @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 are the trial partition functions for single and pair spins , respectively .",

    "since @xmath53 $ ] diminishes as @xmath34 increases , we take @xmath34 as large as physically possible , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the number of linked pairs is maximized .",
    "hence we obtain the following relationship between the variational parameters or molecular fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath57 our system is a spherical nanoparticle composed by @xmath9 atoms arranged in a bcc structure with core coordination number @xmath58=8 and interatomic spacing @xmath59 , which in the case of pure iron is around 2.86   whereas for fe@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2 is around 2.96@xcite .",
    "on the basis of such representation and in order to get an expression for the maximum number of pairs divided by the total number of atoms , i.e. @xmath60 , or , analogously an effective coordination number @xmath61 , we have simulated particles with bcc structure and different diameters @xmath62 , in units of the lattice parameter @xmath59 , and have counted the number of nearest neighbors pairs .",
    "figure 1 shows the size dependence of @xmath63 from which the following relationship is fulfilled for @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath58=8 and the best fit yields @xmath66 for a bcc lattice . in the case of a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice ,",

    "the presence of crossed terms involving the atomic concentrations of the constituent elements @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in eq.([14 ] ) reflects the average over all possible nearest neighbors pairs as well as the random atomic distribution feature .",

    "from the particle size dependence of @xmath63 plotted in fig . 1 , particles with diameter @xmath62=10 ( around 3 nm ) already exhibit an effective coordination number around 7 , which corresponds roughly to 88% of that of the bulk . above @xmath62=10",
    ", the effective coordination number resembles that of the system under bulk conditions . below that value",
    ", coordination number decreases rapidly and , therefore , strong modifications on the magnetic properties are expected to occur in this range , i.e. below around 3 nm . in order to gain a deeper insight on the interpretation of @xmath79 ,",
    "we have computed the coordination number per particle @xmath80 by counting the number of nearest neighbors surrounding the atom at the @xmath15 position , i.e. within the first coordination shell , and an average coordination number was computed according to : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the number of atoms having coordination number @xmath80 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . hence , by comparing the results derived from eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 17 ) in fig.1 , we conclude that what we have called an effective coordination number can indeed be considered as an average coordination number , i.e. @xmath83 . for diameters below around 3.4@xmath59 the average coordination number is characterized by jumps for which the discrete character of the system becomes more evident .",

    "we want to stress that these results are not exclusively applicable to pure @xmath29-fe nanoparticles and they can be , in principle , employed for other pure ferromagnetic nanoparticles like ni or co. we can also relate this critical temperature with that of the system under bulk conditions @xcite in order to obtain a reduced critical temperature : @xmath86}{j(\\infty)ln\\left[z_\\text{eff}/(z_\\text{eff}-2)\\right]},\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the exchange integral ( @xmath87 ) in the nanoparticle can be different from that under bulk conditions ( @xmath88 ) . in a first order of approximation , and by assuming the same exchange integral value , which could be reasonable for high enough particle sizes , we have : @xmath89 if we assume that no structural transition occurs as a consequence of reducing the size .",

    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) . ]",
    "as is observed , curie temperature ( @xmath73 ) decreases as the particle becomes smaller due basically to the decrease in the magnetic bonds density .",
    "therefore , the energy cost to carry out the transition is lower , and thus the critical temperature is also smaller .",
    "as @xmath62 increases the critical temperature @xmath73 tends to its bulk value .",
    "other models have been already proposed to understand the mechanisms lying on the effect of the breaking of exchange bonds upon the @xmath90 function for nanoparticles . on this respect",
    ", the following expression has been proposed @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the thickness of surface layer , and it has been considered as a parameter to characterize the deficiency in the number of exchange bonds for atoms at the surface region of a nanoparticle . however , this model can not reproduce successfully experimental data of magnetite nanoparticles of different size with a constant @xmath92 , and hence , it has been suggested that @xmath92 should vary with the particle size , but such dependence has not been yet established @xcite .",
    "another model , based on the energy - equilibrium criterion between the spin - spin exchange interactions and the thermal vibration energy of atoms at the transition temperature and a size - dependent debye temperature function , was developed in order to obtain both @xmath90 and @xmath93 of ferromagnetic ad antiferromagnetic nanocrystals .",

    "third , for real nanostructures , the average lattice parameter is certainly different from bulk , mainly for very small particles of some few nanometers of diameter and , therefore , exchange integral should undergo changes .",
    "such changes can also be induced by other facts like volume magnetostriction of ni . regarding a particle size dependence of an effective nearest neighbors exchange coupling",
    ", it is interesting to notice that better agreement with experimental data can be achieved by proposing a simple dependence of the form : @xmath97 in eq.([19 ] ) .",
    "this proposal is based on the experimental fact that the lattice parameter of metallic nanoparticles contracts with decreasing particle size in such a way that the lattice parameter contraction ( @xmath98 ) is an inverse function of the diameter of nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "such a lattice contraction is attributed to reduction of surface bonds length as a response to surface stress .",
    "contraction factors may vary with material and crystal orientation .",
    "it has been observed experimentally that the lattice parameter contracts by 2.4% in 5 nm ni particles @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "fcc ni is considered as a strong ferromagnet characterized by a less pronounced rkky behavior , exponentially damped , and a faster decay of the exchange integral with the interatomic distance .",
    "more concretely , ni remains ferromagnetic up to the 5@xmath99 nearest neighbors , and within this range of distance the exchange integral is essentially a decreasing exponential function of interatomic spacing @xcite .",

    "our best estimate for the correlation length critical exponent is @xmath105 .",
    "this exponent is still quite similar to that of a 2d ising model , but slightly different from our previous exponent for the pure case .",
    "this feature is consistent with the harris s criterion @xcite for which a different set of critical exponents may be expected for diluted and random systems having a distribution of exchange integrals . in our case ,",
    "dilution is provided by al atoms and randomness is provided by the random distribution of the atomic elements in the alloy within the crystalline structure and over the entire volume of the nanoparticles .",
    "the exponent is also greater than the computed via monte carlo simulation ( @xmath106 ) of fe@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2 alloys under bulk conditions @xcite .",

    "8 , we show the temperature dependence of magnetization per bond and magnetic susceptibility as obtained from eqs.([14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) respectively . as is observed , our model predicts a magnetization reduction in the low temperature regime , below around 70 k , in agreement with zero field cooling measurements for the bulk case @xcite .",

    "these results are in agreement with those reported by young et al . @xcite and references therein where the difficulty of having an a - t line for short - range ising spin glasses at large fields was evident .",
    "in fact , the existence of a sg ordering in a magnetic field is still an open question @xcite .",
    "second , the freezing temperature is clearly size dependent , i.e. it diminishes as the particle size decreases .",
    "this fact implies that the sg region in the magnetic phase diagram becomes smaller for nanoparticles exhibiting sg behavior within their entire volume and not as a consequence of a merely surface effect as it has been proposed in nanoparticles exhibiting the so - called surface spin - glass - like behavior .",
    "these results suggest that sg behavior observed in bulk systems is reduced when finite size effects become important , which could be attributed to a reduction in the total number of frustrated spins as the particle size becomes smaller .",

    "our value is however somewhat greater than the @xmath3=0.6289@xmath40.0008 value obtained by ferrenberg and landau @xcite for a 3d ising model , where a high - resolution monte carlo study was carried out , and somewhat smaller than the @xmath3=0.79@xmath40.03 value obtained for the same system under bulk conditions @xcite .",
    "these comparisons suggest , contrary to the variational approach , that the 3d@xmath1032d dimensionality crossover does not take place , at least for the range of @xmath62 values we have considered in the present study .",
    "the difference between the correlation length critical exponents , obtained via the variational approach and monte carlo , is attributed to the , so - called , pairs approximation in the variational approach where the trial partition function is computed by dividing the system only in blocks of one and two spins .",
    "this ends up in a reduction of the degree of correlation and consequently in a change of the exponent value .",
    "certainly , a more precise estimative of the partition function , and consequently of the magnetization and @xmath73 , can be achieved by considering the system as formed by higher order blocks ( four , six , eight spins , etc ) @xcite . even though such a calculation is tractable , it turns out heavy and very time consuming . this fact constitutes the main limitation of the variational model .",
    "+ on the other hand , differences respect to the @xmath3 exponent of the pure 3d ising model can be attributed to the diluted character of our system in addition to the disorder involved in the distribution of exchange integrals , which is consistent with harris s criterion @xcite , whereas the difference with respect to the @xmath3 exponent of the same system with periodic boundary conditions is consistent with fisher s theory @xcite .",
    "log - log plot of the particle diameter dependence of the maxima values of the logarithmic derivatives of the magnetization to determine the @xmath3 exponent . ]",
    "the critical behavior of ferromagnetic pure and random diluted nanoparticles with competing interactions has been addressed . in both cases",
    "we have employed the free energy variational principle based on the bogoliubov inequality and an ising model . in the case of random diluted nanoparticles ,",
    "for which we have considered the fe@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2 system as a case of study , we have used , additionally , standard monte carlo simulation . in order to validate the use of the variational approach in nanoparticles , which is carried out for the first time , the model was applied to account for the critical behavior of pure ferromagnetic nanoparticles on the basis of an average nearest neighbors coordination number obtained via numerical simulation .",
    "our results allow to conclude that the variational model is successful in reproducing features of the particle size dependence of the curie temperature for both pure and random diluted particles .",
    "comparisons with other theoretical models and experimental results for ni nanostructures were carried out in order to evaluate the reliability of the model . a better agreement with experimental data",
    "was obtained if a particle size dependence of the nearest neighbors exchange integral is considered consistent with previous works where lattice contraction of metallic nanoparticles has been observed .",
    "+ for random diluted nanoparticles , low temperature magnetization reduction was consistent with the same type of rsg behavior observed in the bulk counterparts in accordance with the almeida - thouless line at low fields . such a rsg behavior is attributed to the presence of competing interactions , randomness and the aluminum dilution effect .",
    "a linear dependence of the freezing temperature with the reciprocal of the particle diameter was also obtained indicating that the corresponding region in the magnetic phase diagram becomes smaller as the particle size diminishes . concerning critical behavior ,",
    "data obtained by using the variational method were fitted with the relationship for critical temperature derived from finite size scaling theory and the best estimate for the correlation length critical exponent was @xmath3=0.926@xmath40.004 . differently from this , a value @xmath3=0.71@xmath40.04 was obtained via monte carlo .",
    "differences are attributed to the so - called pairs - approximation in the variational approach . from both approaches , differences in the @xmath3 exponent of fe@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2 nanoparticles with respect to that of the pure ising model",
    "agree with harris and fisher arguments .",
    "finally , we want to stress that , even though thermodynamical models can be indeed used in the study of nanostructures @xcite and they can reproduce experimental features , special attention must be paid regarding critical behavior depending on the approximations of the model .",
