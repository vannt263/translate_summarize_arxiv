    "during the last two decades , @xmath0 cephei stars became attractive targets for asteroseismic studies .",
    "this has started with the pioneering papers by dziembowski & jerzykiewicz on 16 lac and 12 lac ( dziembowski & jerzykiewicz , 1996 and 1999 , respectively ) .",
    "the analysis of multiplets in 16 lac showed that rotation rate of this star has to increase inward .",
    "the seismic modelling of b - type pulsators have been revived with the paper by aerts , toul , daszyska et al .",
    "( 2003 ) on v836 cen , in which they also found a non - rigid rotation and , for the first time , an evidence for overshooting from a convective core in a massive main sequence star . up to now ,",
    "the most intensively studied @xmath0 cephei stars have been @xmath4 eri and 12 lac which were subjects of multi - site photometric and spectroscopic campaigns ( handler et al .",
    "2004 , aerts et al .",
    "2004 , jerzykiewicz et al .",
    "2005 , handler et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the seismic modelling of @xmath4 eri was done by pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski ( 2004 ) and ausseloos et al .",
    "stronger constraints on stellar structure can be obtained from asteroseismology of the hybrid b - type pulsators in which two types of modes are excited simultaneously , i.e. , low - order pressure and gravity modes ( typical for @xmath0 cephei stars ) and high - order gravity modes ( typical for slowly pulsating b - type stars ) . such studies were done recently by dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2008 ) for @xmath4 eri and 12 lac .",
    "interesting results are coming up for another hybrid pulsating star @xmath5 peg ( handler et al .",
    "2009 ) .    until now",
    ", asteroseismic studies have relied on fitting only pulsation frequencies .",
    "the ultimate goal has been to find models which reproduce observed frequencies by changing various parameters of model and theory , provided that the successful mode identification was obtained beforehand",
    ". however oscillation frequencies are determined mainly by the star s interior , thus they are rather weakly sensitive to the subphotospheric layers .",
    "a few years ago , daszyska - daszkiewicz , dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2003 and 2005a , hereafter dd03 and dd05 ) introduced a new asteroseismic probe , defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the bolometric flux variations to the radial displacement at the photosphere level .",
    "this is so called @xmath2 parameter ; it is determined in the pulsation driving region .",
    "the @xmath2 parameter exhibits a strong dependence on the global stellar parameters , chemical composition , opacities and subphotospheric convection .",
    "therefore , a comparison of empirical values of the @xmath2 parameter with their theoretical counterparts can yield valuable and unique information on stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the theoretical values of @xmath2 result from linear nonadiabatic computations of stellar pulsation . to explore the asteroseismic potential of the @xmath2 parameter , dd03 proposed the method of simultaneous determination of the spherical harmonic degree , @xmath3 , and the nonadiabatic @xmath2 parameter from amplitudes and phases of photometric and radial velocity variations . in this way we can also circumvent uncertainties in mode identification resulting from pulsational input . using this method",
    "one can derive also an estimate of intrinsic amplitude of pulsational modes .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to @xmath6 scuti and @xmath0 cep stars . in the case of @xmath6 scuti variables ,",
    "stringent constraints on the subphotospheric convection were obtained ( dd03 and daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "2005b ) . for the @xmath6 scuti objects studied by these authors",
    ", convective energy transport appeared to be inefficient . for @xmath0 cephei stars , dd05 have shown that the value of @xmath2 is very sensitive to the metallicity parameter , @xmath7 , and to the adopted opacity tables .",
    "moreover , in the case of b - type pulsators , an unambiguous solution exists only if one combines photometry and radial velocity data .    in this paper",
    "we present an asteroseismic study which aims at parallel fitting of the pulsational frequencies and corresponding values of * the complex @xmath2 parameter * , taking into account instability conditions . we will call such studies _",
    "complex asteroseismology_. for our analysis we chose the @xmath0 cep star @xmath1 oph for which time series photometric and spectroscopic data were acquired by handler , shobbrook & mokgwetsi ( 2005 , hereafter hsm05 ) and briquet et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter b05 ) , respectively .",
    "seismic modelling of @xmath1 oph was recently done by briquet et al .",
    "( 2007 ) whose computations were based only on the op tables . here",
    "we shall use both op and opal opacities and incorporate the @xmath2 parameter in the seismic model survey .",
    "the paper is composed as follows . in section 2",
    "we view the basic characteristics of @xmath1 oph .",
    "section 3 is devoted to mode identification of the excited modes using two approaches .",
    "constraints on intrinsic mode amplitude are given in section 4 .",
    "results of complex asteroseismic modelling , adopting the op and opal tables , are given in section 5 .",
    "a summary ends the paper .",
    "@xmath1 oph is the @xmath0 cep pulsator with the b2iv spectral type and the brightness of @xmath8 mag .",
    "it is also a triple system , with the speckle component of the b5 spectral type ( mcalister et al .",
    "1993 , hsm05 ) .",
    "in addition , b05 detected a low mass companion ( @xmath9 ) from spectroscopic observations ; the orbital period of this component is equal to 56.71 d. the main component of the @xmath1 oph system ( @xmath1 oph a ) , has been recognized as a pulsating variable of the @xmath0 cep type already in 1922 by henroteau ( henroteau 1922 ) on the basis of radial velocity observations .",
    "the correct value of the period of about 0.14 d was derived by mcnamara ( 1957 ) .",
    "the projected rotational velocity of @xmath1 oph a is about 30 km / s as measured by abt , levato & grosso ( 2002 ) .",
    "more information on the @xmath1 oph system can be found in the catalog of galactic @xmath0 cephei stars by stankov & handler ( 2005 ) .",
    "a few years ago , the study of @xmath1 oph a , @xmath1 oph henceforth , has been resumed thanks to dedicated photometric and spectroscopic campaigns organized by hsm05 and b05 , respectively .",
    "in fig.1 we show the position of @xmath1 oph in the hr diagram .",
    "the evolutionary tracks from zams to tams were computed with the warsaw - new jersey evolutionary code adopting the op opacities ( seaton 2005 ) and the solar mixture as determined by asplund et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 , hereafter a04 ) .",
    "the rotational velocity at the zams was assumed to be equal to 30 km / s .",
    "as @xmath1 oph has metallicity , @xmath7 , lower than 0.015 , ( daszyska 2001 , niemczura & daszyska - daszkiewicz 2005 , b05 ) , we showed also the effect of the @xmath7 parameter on the evolutionary tracks .",
    "the observational values of effective temperature and luminosity for @xmath1 oph were taken from hsm05 .",
    "determination of effective temperature from spectroscopy gives much higher values , @xmath10 .",
    "for the purpose of later discussion we plotted also lines of constant period with the value of 0.1339 d for the radial fundamental and first overtone mode .",
    "ophiuchi in the hr diagram as determined from photometry by hsm05 .",
    "the evolutionary tracks were computed with the op - a04 opacities , assuming the rotational velocity of @xmath11 km / s , hydrogen abundance , @xmath12 , two values of the metallicity parameter @xmath7 , and no overshooting from the convective core .",
    "we show also lines of constant period ( 0.1339 d ) for the radial fundamental @xmath13 and the first overtone @xmath14 mode .",
    "these lines will be discussed later on.,width=332 ]     ophiuchi .",
    "seven frequencies were extracted from photometry ( hsm05 ) , marked as @xmath15 , and three of them were found in spectroscopic variations ( b05 ) , marked as @xmath16.,width=332 ]    the frequency analysis of time - series multicolour photometry of @xmath1 oph , performed by hsm05 , revealed seven pulsational frequencies in the range from 7.1160 to 7.9734 c / d . the dominant frequency ( @xmath17 c / d ) corresponds to the earlier detected period ( 0.14 d ) by mcnamara ( 1957 ) .",
    "three of these seven frequncies were identified also in spectroscopy by b05 . in fig.2",
    ", we show the oscillation spectrum of @xmath1 oph . with * ph * we marked peaks detected in photometry and with * ph+sp * those three peaks detected both in photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "for the time being , mode identification in main sequence pulsators can not be obtained from oscillation spectra themselves .",
    "therefore , one has to rely on other observational quantities which bring information on the mode geometry .",
    "such observables are , for example , amplitudes and phases of the multicolour photometric and radial velocity variations .",
    "their theoretical values are computed under the assumptions of linear oscillation and plane - parallel , temporally static approximation for atmospheres .",
    "these assumptions are justified in the case of main sequence pulsators .",
    "if the effects of rotation on pulsation are ignored then the expression for the complex amplitude of the light variations in the passband @xmath18 can be written in the form ( see , e.g. , daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "2002 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 is the mode intrinsic amplitude , @xmath24 is the inclination angle and @xmath25 are the spherical harmonic degree and the azimuthal order of the mode , respectively . symbols @xmath26 have their usual meanings .",
    "the amplitudes and phases are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath29 describes temperature effects , @xmath30 - geometrical effects , and @xmath31 - the influence of pressure changes .",
    "the terms @xmath29 and @xmath31 include the perturbation of the limb - darkening .",
    "@xmath32 is the disc - averaging factor expressed as the integral of the limb - darkening weighted by the legendre polynomial with the @xmath3 degree .",
    "derivatives of the monochromatic flux , @xmath33 , are calculated from static atmosphere models . in general , they depend also on the metallicity parameter [ m / h ] and microturbulence velocity @xmath34 . here , we use the kurucz ( 2004 ) atmosphere models and claret ( 2000 ) limb - darkening coefficients .",
    "as was already mentioned in introduction , the @xmath2 parameter describes the ratio of the bolometric flux perturbation to the radial displacement at the level of the photosphere : @xmath35 the value of @xmath2 can be obtained from linear computations of stellar pulsation ; because of nonadiabatic character of the pulsation , this quantity is complex .",
    "here we use the pulsational code of w. dziembowski .",
    "if data on radial velocity variations are available , then the amplitude and phases of these variations can be included in a process of mode identification .",
    "the radial velocity is determined from observations as the first moment of well separated line profile , @xmath36 . according to dziembowski ( 1977 ) ,",
    "the expression for the complex amplitude of the radial velocity variations is the following @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are another disc - averaging factors introduced by dziembowski ( 1977 ) .    in principle",
    ", two approaches can be used in mode identification .",
    "the first approach makes use of amplitude ratios and phases differences and employs input from the pulsation theory , i.e. , the @xmath2 parameter . in the linear and non - rotation approximation ,",
    "the amplitude ratios and phases differences are independent of the intrinsic mode amplitude , @xmath23 , azimuthal order , @xmath40 , and the inclination angle , @xmath24 , because the factor @xmath41 cancels out .",
    "the second method employs amplitudes and phases alone in order to determine from data the empirical values of @xmath2 and the intrinsic amplitude dependent on inclination , @xmath42 , together with the mode degree , @xmath3 .",
    "both methods require input from models of stellar atmospheres .",
    "strmgren passbands with positions of seven pulsational frequencies detected by handler et al .",
    "2005.,width=332 ]        observations of @xmath1 oph in the @xmath43 strmgren photometry were kindly provided by gerald handler . from these data we determined amplitudes and phases of the seven frequencies detected by hsm05 and ,",
    "following hsm05 , the amplitudes were corrected for the light contribution from the speckle companion : @xmath44 . although the phase differences between photometric passbands are small , they are not negligible , as shown in fig.3 for the @xmath45 pair .",
    "therefore , we included also these quantities to discriminate between various @xmath3 degrees . to this end",
    "we use , as usually , the following discriminant : @xmath46 where @xmath47 are observational and theoretical photometric observables , respectively , such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "n is the number of passbands and if we use only amplitude ratios we have to skip 2 in the denominator before the sum .",
    "the index @xmath50 denotes the photometric passband to which the others , @xmath51 , are normalized and @xmath52 are the observational errors of the @xmath53 quantities . because we treat measurements in different passbands as independent variables , the formulae for errors ( @xmath52 ) are : @xmath54 , \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] and @xmath55 we perform mode identification for the whole range of allowed stellar parameters and different values of metallicity .    in fig.4 , we show results of our mode identification for the seven pulsational frequencies of @xmath1 oph .",
    "this is an example for the model with parameters : @xmath56 , computed with the op - a04 opacities .",
    "the character of @xmath57 for the other models is qualitatively the same .",
    "we consider stellar atmospheres with two values of the microturbulence velocity : @xmath58 and 8 km / s . * in some cases",
    "a value of @xmath59 is less than 1 which comes from large observational errors . *",
    "our identifications of the @xmath3 degrees agree with those obtained by hsm05 who used only photometric amplitudes .",
    "a discussion of the @xmath3 identification for each frequency will be given at the end of the next subsection .",
    "three pulsational frequencies ( @xmath60 ) were found in both photometric and spectroscopic observations of @xmath1 oph . by combining these two types of data , we can identify the @xmath3 degree of these three frequencies and extract corresponding empirical values of the nonadiabatic @xmath2 parameter . in our analysis",
    "we use the radial velocity as determined by the first moment of the siiii4553 spectral line .",
    "these data were kindly provided by maryline briquet . in our analysis",
    "we included only these spectra which coincide in time photometric observations .",
    "the method of simultaneous determination of @xmath3 and @xmath2 has been described in details by dd03 and dd05 , and we will not repeat this here .",
    "each passband , @xmath18 , yields l.h.s . of equations ( 1 ) whereas data on the radial velocity yield l.h.s . of equation ( 4 ) .",
    "this set of linear equations is solved for a specified @xmath3 in order to determine two complex * unknown * quantities : @xmath61 and @xmath62 . with three passbands and the radial velocity data we have a set of four complex equations .",
    "the idea is to derive the value of the nonadiabatic parameter @xmath2 and the intrinsic amplitude @xmath61 from observations , which fit best the theoretical and observational amplitudes and phases for a given @xmath3 degree .",
    "the goodness of fit is calculated as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of passbands plus one ( to account for the fact that we use the radial velocity measurements ) and @xmath65 is the number of parameters to be determined .",
    "here @xmath18 denotes either the photometric passband or radial velocity . @xmath66 and @xmath67 are complex observational and theoretical amplitudes , respectively , and @xmath68 are the observational errors . because we treat amplitudes and phases as independent variables , the formula for the errors is @xmath69 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the results of mode identification by the above method for the first three frequencies of @xmath1 oph are shown in fig.5 .",
    "various lines correspond to the uncertainties in the stellar parameters .",
    "we calculated @xmath70 for the models from the center and from the four edges of the error box in fig.1 .    in table1",
    "we give a summary of the @xmath3 identification from the two approaches .",
    "from both methods , the dominant frequency is undoubtedly a @xmath71 mode and the @xmath72 frequency is a radial mode . in the case of the @xmath73 frequency",
    ", we were able to exclude the @xmath74 degree from combined multicolour photometry and radial velocity data .",
    "for the remaining frequencies , we can rely only on mode identification from photometry alone .",
    "the three frequency peaks , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , are equidistance and most probably form a close @xmath77 triplet .",
    "other values of @xmath3 are also possible but because the disc averaging effects increase very rapidly with @xmath3 , we regard these higher degrees as much less probable and assume , as hsm05 , that this is the @xmath77 triplet .",
    "the @xmath78 identification for @xmath76 is of course excluded because @xmath76 is too close to @xmath72 which is the radial mode .",
    "the @xmath79 frequency can be identified either as @xmath3=1 or 2 or 3 , with a lower probability for the @xmath74 identification . for the dominant mode ,",
    "b05 identified also the azimuthal order , @xmath80 , on the basis of amplitudes and phases across the siiii line profile .    although there are some regularities in frequency spacing between @xmath81 and @xmath73 , we are more cautious about believing that they are components of the same quintuplet .",
    "the regularities suggest that @xmath79 may be the @xmath82 mode and @xmath73 - the @xmath83 mode , as was assumed by briquet et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in their seismic analysis of @xmath1 oph .",
    "however , from the amplitude and phase diagrams computed by b05 from variations of the siiii line profile , the frequency @xmath84 c / d looks rather like a @xmath85 mode , because the phase change is close to @xmath86 around the line center ( see fig.3 of b05 ) .    thus , our complex seismic analysis we will be based on frequencies @xmath72 and",
    "@xmath87 which are well identified centroid modes with @xmath78 and @xmath77 , respectively , and we postpone studies of rotational effect until more than one multiplet will be well identified .",
    ".summary of mode identification using two methods for frequency peaks detected in @xmath1 ophiuchi . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      in fig.1 we have plotted lines of a constant period ( 0.1339 d ) for fundamental ( @xmath88 ) and first overtone ( @xmath89 ) radial mode .",
    "these line correspond to @xmath90 c / d .",
    "as we can see , within the allowed space of stellar parameters there are two possible identifications for the radial order : @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "to discriminate between these two identifications , we shall use results from the method of dd03 ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "firstly , we can calculate values of @xmath70 as a function of effective temperature for the case of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this is shown in fig.6 .",
    "the vertical lines mark the allowed range of @xmath91 .",
    "although the fundamental mode takes lower values of @xmath70 , we can not exclude the first overtone from this graph because both lines reach acceptable values of @xmath70 .",
    "another way to discriminate between the two radial orders for the @xmath78 mode is to compare theoretical and empirical values of the nonadiabatic @xmath2 parameter ( see dd05 ) . the photometric and spectroscopic data for @xmath1 oph allowed to determine the values of @xmath2 for the @xmath72 mode with sufficient accuracy to use them to this aim . in fig.7",
    "we show such comparison .",
    "only models with stellar parameters within the error box of fig.1 were considered .",
    "as we can see , the @xmath92 identification is clear and @xmath72 is the radial fundamental mode .",
    "in addition , lines of constant values of the instability parameter , @xmath93 , are shown . only models to the right of this line have unstable radial modes . in fig.7 , we show also the sensitivity of the theoretical @xmath2 parameter to metallicity prameter @xmath7 .",
    "a comparison of theoretical and empirical values of @xmath2 gives also additional support to the result that metallicity of @xmath1 oph is lower than @xmath94 .     as a function of the effective temperature for the frequency @xmath72 identified as the l=0 mode .",
    "two possible values of the radial order , @xmath92 , were considered .",
    "vertical dotted lines indicate the allowed range of @xmath95.,width=332 ]     parameter for the radial mode @xmath72 .",
    "the upper panel refers to the fundamental mode hypothesis and the lower one , to the first overtone mode hypothesis .",
    "theoretical values of @xmath2 were calculated with the op - a04 opacities , metallicity @xmath96 , 0.015 and 0.012 , and assuming stellar parameters within the error box .",
    "lines of constant values of the instability parameter , @xmath97 , are labeled as @xmath93.,width=332 ]    after fixing the @xmath92 order of the @xmath72 radial mode as @xmath98 , we can try to associate the radial orders also for other frequencies .",
    "a survey of pulsational models showed that the @xmath77 triplet can be identified as @xmath98 , whereas the dominant @xmath99 mode , as a component of the @xmath100 quintuplet .",
    "having determined the value of @xmath42 from the method of dd03 in section 3.2 , we can get a lower limit for the value of the intrinsic mode amplitude , @xmath23 , and , in the case of a radial mode , its exact value .",
    "the available observations of @xmath1 oph allow to determine the values of @xmath61 for @xmath101 and @xmath72 with a sufficient accuracy .",
    "the dominant mode , @xmath101 , is unequivocally the @xmath71 mode .",
    "moreover , from spectroscopic time series analysis b05 identified its azimuthal order as @xmath80 . with these angular numbers",
    ", we can calculate the intrinsic amplitude of the dominant mode as a function of the inclination angle .",
    "the result is shown in fig.8 .",
    "as one can see , inclination angles close to @xmath102 are excluded because of the node line of the @xmath99 mode .",
    "the minimum value of the intrinsic amplitude of the dominant mode is equal to 0.0098 at i=45@xmath103 , i.e. 0.98% of the stellar radius . in the case of the @xmath72 frequency , which correspond to the radial mode , we estimated the exact value of @xmath23 as 0.0014 , i.e. 0.14% of the stellar radius .",
    "these estimates mean that the intrinsic amplitude of the dominant @xmath99 mode is at least 7 times larger than that of the radial mode . here",
    "the open problem of mode selection emerges and such determinations can bring us closer to a solution .    , @xmath99 , as a function of the inclination angle .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath104 is equal to about 0.01 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 for the radial mode , @xmath72 , is plotted as the dotted line.,width=332 ]",
    "we shall perform our seismic modelling in two steps .",
    "firstly , we find a family of models which fit the two centroid frequencies of @xmath1 ophuichi , i.e. , @xmath72 , which was identified as the @xmath105 mode , and @xmath87 , which is the centroid of the @xmath106 triplet . in the next step , from this set of models",
    "we will select only those which reproduce , within the observational errors , the empirical values of @xmath2 of the radial fundamental mode .      to construct our seismic models , we use two frequencies : @xmath107 ( the @xmath78 mode ) and @xmath108 c / d ( the @xmath77 centroid mode ) , because the @xmath101 frequency is a non - axisymmetric @xmath71 mode with @xmath80 , while frequencies @xmath73 and @xmath79 do not have unambiguous identification .",
    "we searched for models fitting these two frequencies by changing various parameters : the mass , @xmath65 , the effective temperature , @xmath109 , the chemical abundance , ( @xmath110 ) , and the core overshooting parameter , @xmath111 .",
    "the effect of overshooting was computed according to the new formulation of dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2008 ) .",
    "this new treatment takes into account not only the distance of the overshooting but also partial mixing in the overshoot layer . in our seismic modelling , we relied on the latest determination of the solar element mixture by a04 and used both the op tables ( seaton 2005 ) and opal tables ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) .",
    "the rotational splitting for the @xmath77 triplet is about 0.1 c / d , giving the rotational velocity of @xmath11 km / s for the stellar radius of about @xmath112 ; this is consistent with the @xmath113 value derived by abt , levato & grosso ( 2002 ) mentioned in section 2 .",
    "we assumed this value of @xmath114 in all computations .    in fig.9",
    "we show the results of our seismic modelling for the op data on the @xmath115 plane .",
    "the instability borders are labeled with @xmath93 and shown as the thick solid and thick dotted lines for the @xmath78 and @xmath77 modes , respectively .",
    "only models above those lines are unstable and reproduce the observed frequencies @xmath72 and @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , we depicted also the lines of constant mass and effective temperature .",
    "we show results for two values of hydrogen abundance : @xmath12 ( the left panel ) and @xmath116 ( the right panel ) .    from such data , one can easily find the relation for a family of seismic models for a fixed value of @xmath117 in the form : @xmath118 as we can see , models with lower @xmath7 require more core overshooting .",
    "this is because for a higher value of @xmath7 the convective core is larger , implying a lower value of the overshooting distance .",
    "the same result was obtained by briquet et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for @xmath1 oph and by dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2008 ) in their studies of hybrid pulsators , @xmath4 eri and 12 lac .",
    "a similar dependence was also obtained for lower mass stars ( m .- j .",
    "goupil , private communication ) . on the other hand , at a given metallicity , for a higher value of @xmath117 we need higher value of @xmath111 to get pulsational instability .    all these seismic models of @xmath1 oph prefers lower effective temperatures and lower masses .",
    "the lower effective temperature limit is @xmath119 , thus most of these seismic models are outside the error box .",
    "we would like to mention that a lower value of effective temperature was determined from the iue spectra by niemczura & daszyska ( 2005 ) who derived @xmath120 .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra of the @xmath1 oph system are dominated by the main component , i.e. the early b - type star , which emits most energy in uv and dominates this part of spectrum .",
    "therefore , this lower value of @xmath95 can be more reliable and it is also more consistent with seismic models .",
    "the higher value of @xmath117 require even lower values of @xmath121 .",
    "the effect of the opacity tables will be discussed in the next section .",
    "determination of empirical values of @xmath2 puts additional and unique constraints on seismic models . in that way",
    ", we are going one step further by a requirement of fitting simultaneously pulsational frequencies and the corresponding values of @xmath2 .",
    "the sensitivity of the theoretical @xmath2 parameter to metallicity is very strong and was already shown in fig.7 .",
    "how this quantity depends on the hydrogen abundance , overshooting distance and adopted opacity tables is demonstrated in fig.10 .",
    "as we can see , the strongest effect comes from opacity data .",
    "the amount of hydrogen and the overshooting distance have a minor effect on the value of @xmath2 .    from a set of seismic models found in section 5.1 , we singled out only those which have the @xmath2 parameter for the radial mode consistent with the observed values within the errors . having also another source of opacity data , we studied the effect of this input on the seismic models .",
    "in fig.11 we plotted similar diagrams as in fig.9 , but at a fixed hydrogen abundance ( @xmath12 ) and considering both the op tables ( the left panel ) and the opal tables ( the right panel ) .",
    "we superimposed areas resulting from fitting empirical values of @xmath2 for the radial mode .",
    "as we can see , only models calculated with the opal tables can account for the empirical @xmath2 parameters with a reasonable value of the overshooting distance .",
    "an interesting fact is that with both opacity tables it was possible to reproduce the real parts of @xmath2 for lower values of @xmath123 , whereas only the opal data gave consistency also in the imaginary parts of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a very important and revealing result .",
    "it shows how complex asteroseismic studies can test data on microscopic physics .",
    "another support for the opal data is that with these opacities we get also a better agreement between stellar parameters of seismic models and those derived from photometric or spectroscopic observations .",
    "for the radial mode of @xmath1 oph .",
    "theoretical @xmath2 parameters were computed for different values of the hydrogen abundance , @xmath117 , the overshooting parameter , @xmath111 , and for two sources of opacity data . the a04 solar chemical mixture was adopted and metallicity fixed at z=0.015 . , width=332 ]",
    "our analysis showed a great potential of probing parameters of stellar models and microphysics by means of the nonadiabatic parameter @xmath2 . incorporating this quantity in seismic modelling provides much stronger constraints and a new kind of information .",
    "the adequate seismic model should account not only for oscillation frequencies but also for the empirical values of @xmath2 , visibility and instability conditions .",
    "this kind of seismic modelling we called _",
    "complex asteroseismology_. the aim of the complex asteroseismic analysis is to find stellar models which fit both oscillation frequencies and corresponding @xmath2 parameters .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is determined in subphotospheric layers which only weakly affect the pulsational frequencies .",
    "therefore , these two asteroseismic tools ( @xmath124 ) are complementary to each other and treating them simultaneously can improve seismic modelling of any kind of pulsating stars . as was already discussed by dd05 , for b - type pulsators , the @xmath2 seismic tool probes in particular stellar metallicity and opacities . in this paper",
    ", we have demonstrated that even with data on only two well identified centroid modes and the empirical @xmath2 parameter for the radial mode we can derive very strong constraints on stellar parameters , core overshooting and , in particular , on opacities .",
    "our analysis of @xmath1 ophiuchi showed that only with the opal table it was possible to reproduce simultaneously the two pulsational frequencies and the empirical value of @xmath2 corresponding to the radial mode .",
    "seismic models obtained with the op data require enormous amounts of core overshooting , at least @xmath125 , which we consider not physical for a mass and rotational velocity appropriate for @xmath1 oph .",
    "computations with the opal tables allowed to achieve agreement between observed and theoretical values of @xmath2 for a wide space of parameters , @xmath126 , fixed by the mode frequency fitting .",
    "such complex asteroseismic studies provide a critical and unique test for stellar opacities and the atomic physics .",
    "another important results of this paper are valuable constraints on the intrinsic amplitude for the dominant @xmath127 mode and for the @xmath78 mode .",
    "we have found out that the dominant mode of @xmath1 oph has to be excited with the intrinsic amplitude at least seven times larger than the radial mode .",
    "although , in the framework of linear theory , we can not compare these values with theoretical predictions , such estimates can give us some guidelines to the mode selection mechanism in the @xmath0 cephei pulsators .",
    "we gratefully thank gerald handler and maryline briquet for kindly providing photometric observations and data on moments of the siiii4553 spectral line of @xmath1 oph , respectively .",
    "we appreciate also discussion with gerald handler on observational aspects and thank for his useful comments .",
