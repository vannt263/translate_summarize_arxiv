    "it is a well - known fact that , as a result of observational bias and planetary perturbations , the distribution of the orbital elements of the near - earth object ( neo ) population is significantly non - random ( see e.g. jeongahn & malhotra 2014 ) .",
    "the largest known dynamically quasi - coherent subpopulation is that of the so - called taurid complex asteroids ( steel , asher & clube 1991 ) with two groups of objects with apsidal lines approximately aligned with those of asteroid 2212 hephaistos ( 1978 sb ) and comet 2p / encke ( asher , clube & steel 1993 ) .",
    "this stream of material could be made of debris left behind by a large comet that disintegrated tens of thousands of years ago ( steel et al .",
    "1991 ) , but dynamically resonant substructure is also possible ( soja et al .",
    "2011 ; sekhar & asher 2013 ) .",
    "another obvious source of dynamical coherence among neos can be traced back to comets and active asteroids ( jewitt 2012 ) that produce fragments which initially move in unison .",
    "although dynamical coherence among neos should exist , no firm evidence on this matter has been produced yet .",
    "schunov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have shown that robust statistical estimates of a dynamical link between neos require groups of four or more objects , but they could not find any statistically significant group of dynamically related neos among 7563 objects .",
    "however , in schunov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) the significance of asteroid clusters was computed by comparing them to a scrambled version of the observed distribution in order to have a realistic but cluster - free background to compare against , and they used the @xmath0-criterion of southworth & hawkins ( 1963 , @xmath1 ) as metric .",
    "the presence of dynamical coherence among neos is an interesting topic by itself , but it is also of considerable importance to the subject of planetary defence as it makes the quantification of the risk of meteoroid strikes on earth difficult . here , we compute statistical significance maps for the currently known neo population and study the possible presence of robust dynamical groupings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we discuss both the data and the methodology used in our analysis .",
    "significance maps are presented in section 3 .",
    "our results are validated using multiple techniques in section 4 .",
    "relevant dynamical groupings are explored in section 5 .",
    "section 6 discusses our results and their implications .",
    "a summary of our conclusions is given in section 7 .",
    "in order to identify statistically significant dynamical groupings among the neo population we use the list of neos currently catalogued ( as of 2015 november 5 , 13392 objects ) by the jet propulsion laboratory s ( jpl ) solar system dynamics group ( ssdg ) small - body database ( sbdb ) , and the @xmath0-criteria of lindblad & southworth ( 1971 ) , @xmath2 , and that of valsecchi , jopek & froeschl ( 1999 ) , @xmath3 . therefore , we focus on semimajor axis , @xmath4 , eccentricity , @xmath5 , and inclination , @xmath6 , for objects with perihelion distance , @xmath7 , @xmath8  au . given the statistical nature of our methodology , the fact that the information in the data base is incomplete and biased is irrelevant as we seek statistically significant dynamical groupings among known neos .",
    "most of these objects have been observed because they passed close to our planet .",
    "if they are close passers , this sample corresponds to bodies that may eventually collide with the earth .",
    "in fact , some of them have small but non - zero impact probability .",
    "the list includes 13220 near - earth asteroids ( neas ) and 172 near - earth comets ( necs ) .",

    "the bin width has been computed using the freedman - diaconis rule ( freedman & diaconis 1981 ) , i.e. @xmath9 , where iqr is the interquartile range and @xmath10 is the number of data points .",
    "most objects can be found in the region within @xmath11  au , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",

    "we have generated a large number of virtual neos under the form of sets of orbital elements with @xmath8  au , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , longitude of the ascending node , @xmath17 , and argument of perihelion , @xmath18 .",
    "these parameters are randomly sampled from a uniform distribution .",
    "for each set , we have computed the @xmath0-criteria with all the neos currently catalogued and counted the number of minor bodies with both @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these reference values of @xmath0 are reasonable when associating meteors with their parent bodies ( see e.g. rudawska , vaubaillon & atreya 2012 ) . in summary",
    ", we generate a random virtual neo within a chosen volume of the parameter space and count how many real neos have both @xmath19 and @xmath20 with respect to the virtual one .",
    "we repeat this step mutiple times in order to sample properly the chosen volume of the parameter space , creating a three - dimensional random mesh . in this way",
    ", we compute the average number of real neos and its standard deviation that satisfy the assumed constraints in @xmath0 for sets of orbital elements generated uniformly . using these values , we can readily estimate the statistical significance of any putative neo clustering , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the count number for a given set of elements and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the average value and its standard deviation for the entire numerical experiment .    in the following , we consider that any set of orbital elements with an associated number of bodies under 3@xmath25 corresponds to an assumed background population for which no dynamical coherence different from a random one is present",
    ". sets of orbital elements with associated number of bodies above 5@xmath25 are singled out for further study .",
    "given the discrete nature of our approach , sets of orbital elements relatively close to each other in parameter space have comparatively high ( or low ) numbers of associated bodies .",
    "this lets us produce statistical significance maps in terms of @xmath25 and easily identify the regions of the studied volume in orbital parameter space for which the number of known minor bodies is substantially above the average or , what we call , the background ( see section 4 for additional details ) .",
    "it may be argued that many of the orbits available from sbdb are based on short or very short arcs and , therefore , this will make our conclusions less robust or even entirely questionable .",
    "fortunately , given two sets of orbital elements , one fixed and the second one variable within reasonable tolerances ( i.e. @xmath26 per cent ) the resulting values of @xmath19 and @xmath3 are still not too different and in any case close enough to make any variations in the final count virtually irrelevant for any practical purposes .",
    "in addition , the large number of trials performed further contributes to minimizing any possible harmful effects . as an internal consistency test",
    ", the clusterings with the highest statistical significance ( @xmath2713.5@xmath25 with @xmath2770 members ) are invariably associated with the most recent documented fragmentation episode within the neo orbital realm , that of comet 73p / schwassmann - wachmann 3 ( see e.g. weaver et al .",
    "2006 ) with @xmath28 au , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "figure [ maps ] summarizes our statistical analysis ; the colours in the colour maps are proportional to the value of the statistical significance in units of @xmath25 .",
    "two different experiments are shown : 1@xmath31 sets of orbital elements with @xmath8  au , @xmath15 , @xmath32 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18(left - hand panels ) and 5@xmath33 sets with @xmath8  au but @xmath34 and @xmath35(right - hand panels ) .",
    "for the first statistical experiment @xmath36 and for the second one @xmath37 neos ; the errors quoted correspond to the values of the standard deviation . in both experiments",
    "we use the same input data , the 13392 neos , but different resolutions 1@xmath31 and 5@xmath33 , respectively , i.e. the size of the sample is always the same . for each experiment",
    ", we consider that those sets of orbital elements with associated counts under 3@xmath25 ( see above and section 4 ) are compatible with statistical fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "those with associated counts above 5@xmath25 represent bona fide dynamical groupings ( i.e. groups resulting from the perturbing action of resonances ) and , in some cases , perhaps even genetically related asteroid clusters .",
    "each statistically significant dynamical grouping is likely to include unrelated interlopers ( compatible with the background population and perhaps as high as 10 per cent in fraction ) and statistically significant neighbouring groups may correspond to a single piece of coherent dynamical substructure as the orbital subdomains overlap and our approach is discrete .",
    "given the fact that spectroscopic information for individual asteroids is scarce at present , it is not possible to investigate properly which fraction of clustered neos could be true , genetic siblings .",
    "+    in principle , the most striking feature in fig .",
    "[ maps ] is obviously the vast taurid complex .",
    "steel & asher ( 1996 ) characterized the orbital domain occupied by the taurid complex asteroids as @xmath38  au , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "our significance maps suggest a larger size although some of the statistically significant substructure is well outside the region outlined by steel & asher ( 1996 ) , particularly if the value of @xmath5 is considered . in order to better understand the maps , we show in fig . [ all ]",
    "the values of the orbital elements @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 as a function of the statistical significance of the groupings .",
    "some regularities are clearly seen , but also the presence of outliers .",
    "not considering outliers , the best dynamical groupings have @xmath41  au , @xmath42 , and @xmath43(with a significance of @xmath2712@xmath25 and @xmath2760 members ) .",
    "the value of the eccentricity is at the edge of the most probable range in fig .",
    "[ histo ] , and far from the median value of 0.47 and within the fourth quartile ; the value of the inclination is far from the median value of 947 and belongs to the first quartile .",
    "these statistical facts suggest that any clustering found is real and not linked to the most probable values of the orbital parameters of the sample studied . in other words ,",
    "the observed dynamical substructure is unlikely to be the result of harmful selection effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the most significant dynamical groupings ( not outliers ) are near the edge or outside the taurid complex as defined by steel & asher ( 1996 ) which indicates that the majority of the observed dynamical groupings may not be directly related to the taurid complex although it is possible that non - gravitational forces may have populated orbits outside the taurid complex after the hierarchical disintegration of a giant comet as envisioned by steel et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .    .",
    "the apparent quantization of the data is induced by the discrete value of the counts and the underlying substructure . ]",
    "if we focus on the dynamical groupings with statistical significance above 5@xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ best ] ) , we observe that a number of them appear organized along well - defined tracks , curves of constant perihelion distance . this type of substructure is normally associated with resonances .",
    "mean - motion resonances in this region are relatively weak , but secular resonances where the precession of the node of the perihelion of a neo relative to a planet librates could be strong .",
    "the effect of secular resonances in the region of semimajor axes smaller than 2  au was first studied in a seminal paper by michel & froeschl ( 1997 ) and further explored in michel ( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "michel & froeschl ( 1997 ) found that objects with @xmath44  au and @xmath45  au are affected by secular resonances ( in particular with the earth , mars and saturn ) and those with @xmath46  au and @xmath47  au are affected by the kozai mechanism ( kozai 1962 ) that , at low inclination , induces libration of the argument of perihelion around 0or 180(see e.g. michel & thomas 1996 ) .",
    "an argument of perihelion librating around 0means that the orbit reaches perihelion at approximately the same time it crosses the ecliptic from south to north ( the ascending node ) ; a libration around 180implies that the perihelion is close to the descending node .",
    "although their calculations were completed making a number of assumptions which are in conflict with the range of parameters studied here ( in particular , they focused on relatively low values of the eccentricity , @xmath48 ) , their findings are the key to understanding why the clustering tends to appear along tracks instead of in the form of spots of more or less circular symmetry that may signal relatively recent asteroidal ( or cometary ) disruption events .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ best ] indicate the set of orbits having perihelion at the characteristic distances found by michel & froeschl ( 1997 ) .",
    "the curve corresponding to a value of the perihelion distance of 0.82 au reproduces one of the tracks quite well , strongly suggesting that secular resonances shepherd asteroids around , sculpting the orbital architecture of the neo population .",
    "objects confined near the curve of perihelion distance equal to 0.82  au reach perihelion within the region that separates the orbital domain where the kozai mechanism is dominant from that where secular perturbations are active ( see figs 2 and 3 in michel & froeschl 1997 ) .",
    "similar reasonings can be made for other substructures .",
    "figure [ best ] can be interpreted from an evolutionary point of view . assuming that no major observational biases are at work ( see below ) , the areas of the figure where more objects are observed can be seen as intrinsically more stable and therefore more suitable to retain neos in their neighbourhood for longer time - scales .",
    "those devoid of objects are either dynamically unstable or prone to be associated with impact orbits . in other words , neos following more stable orbits are more likely to be observed and those populating sets of trajectories that intersect the orbits of the inner planets will be depleted more efficiently via actual impacts or dynamical ejections following close encounters .",
    "this evolutionary interpretation has been previously used in froeschl et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to distinguish between fast tracks affected by strong and rapid changes in @xmath5 due to resonances and slow tracks characterized by a random walk in @xmath4 due to close approaches to an inner planet .",
    "unfortunately , those neos that pass closer to the earth , even if they are very small , are also the ones more likely to be detected no matter how unstable their orbits are . in summary ,",
    "a fully evolutionary interpretation is not possible in this case due to strong selection effects .    .",
    "these dynamical groupings are likely to include objects which are dynamically or even genetically linked .",
    "the curves indicate the set of orbits having perihelion at ( from top to bottom ) : 0.458 au ( mercury s aphelion ) , 0.65 au , 0.72 au ( venus semimajor axis ) , 0.82 au , 0.9 au , 0.983 au ( earth s perihelion ) , and 1.017 au ( earth s aphelion ) . ]",
    "if we shift our focus to the marginally significant groupings with 35@xmath25 ( these groupings usually have 18 to 30 members ) , further substructure is uncovered , including dynamical groupings with higher inclination and lower eccentricity .",
    "the level of dynamical complexity is similar to the one found within the main asteroid belt ( see e.g. nesvorn , bro & carruba 2015 ) although the values of the eccentricity are higher .",
    "figure [ soso ] shows that relevant clustering is still mostly organized along lines of constant perihelia although the evidence is not as clear as in the case of high - significance dynamical groupings ( above 5@xmath25 ) hinting at the presence of strong background contamination .",
    "but for groupings with statistical significance in the range 35@xmath25 .",
    "most of these groupings are probably chance alignments .",
    "the curves indicate the set of orbits having perihelion at ( from top to bottom ) : 0.4 au , 0.458 au ( mercury s aphelion ) , 0.65 au , 0.82 au , 0.9 au , 0.983 au ( earth s perihelion ) , 1.017 au ( earth s aphelion ) , and 1.1 au . ]    in general , performance of statistical significance maps is affected by tessellation geometry ( variation of cell size and cell shape ) as well as aggregation level ( average cell size ) .",
    "they depend on counts on a grid cell and a single actual cluster that is bisected by a large cell may appear either as not significant or as two distinct groupings depending on whether the large cell is included in the studied zone . our monte carlo - style ( metropolis & ulam 1949 ; press et al . 2007 ) approach avoids these problems as there are no real cells ; our counts satisfy that both @xmath19 and @xmath20 and their centres are randomly chosen .",
    "as long as enough sets of virtual orbital elements are examined , no statistically significant groupings can be missed .",
    "but , could it be that the statistically significant groupings found above are just statistical artefacts ? in order to verify the strength and reliability of our dynamical grouping recovery algorithm ,",
    "we have tested our method on data from a uniform distribution , the original data altered by adding gaussian noise , and data from the synthetic neossat-1.0 orbital model described in greenstreet , ngo & gladman ( 2012 ) .",
    "we have also studied the role of the value of the cut - off parameter and diverse techniques to subtracting the background .",
    "let us assume that we have a population of neos with values of the orbital elements uniformly distributed within the domain @xmath8  au ( uniform in @xmath49 but not in @xmath4 ) , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath17 , and @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ histo ] clearly shows that this assumption is incorrect , but it is still a useful approximation if we want to define a significance threshold on purely mathematical grounds .",
    "such hypothetical and ideal population is not affected by resonances and does not include any dynamical grouping nor genetic asteroid family .",
    "we have generated 13392 virtual objects following this specification and subjected the resulting data to the same analysis described above , generating 5@xmath33 sets of orbital elements also within the domain @xmath8  au , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath17 , and @xmath50 .",

    "our statistically best groupings have all more than 30 members ( see above ) . within the 5@xmath33 sets , the one with the highest statistical significance had 21 members which implies that the sampling resolution ( 5@xmath33 sets ) was high enough to identify correctly those groupings which are likely due to statistical fluctuations .    , right - hand panel",

    "2007 ) . adding noise simulates the role played by errors in orbit determination .",
    "these scrambled - by - noise realizations can also be used as realistic but cluster - free backgrounds to compare against , particularly the one generated by adding a level of gaussian noise as high as 90 per cent ( see below ) .",

    "this automatically induces overdispersion , i.e. the variance is larger than the mean .",
    "focusing on dynamical groupings with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the observed overdispersion is due to two factors .",

    "secondly , not all the objects have the same tendency to have others nearby in terms of the metrics used here .",
    "neos captured in stable resonances are more likely to have others in their dynamical neighbourhood .",

    "this degree of overdispersion is mostly induced by excessive zero counts that lead to underestimate the variance of the number of dynamically related neos which in turn overstates the significance of the dynamical groupings . however",
    ", this is not a concern in our case because when we changed the value of the cut - off parameter to 0.1 , we lowered the probability of having exactly zero or one dynamically related object and the statistical significance of most relevant dynamical groupings remained nearly the same ( compare fig .",

    "this group of peculiar objects has been recently reviewed in detail by de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2015a ) and they are unlikely to form a genetically related family although asteroids 2014  ek@xmath104 and 2013 rz@xmath105 ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2015c ) follow very similar orbits ( including five orbital elements ) . objects in this group are trapped in a web of resonances that keep many of them within the earth s co - orbital zone for tens of thousands of years as they experience repeated resonant episodes of the horseshoe , quasi - satellite , or trojan type .    -criteria as a function of the statistical significance for the data in fig .",

    "[ ds ] have relatively high values of @xmath19 , and @xmath3 because they include fractions of interlopers of 5 per cent or higher .",
    "this further supports the conclusion that most of the observed dynamical substructure has its roots in secular resonances not in breakup events . without a doubt , catastrophic failure of neos happened in the past history of the solar system ( i.e. the taurid complex ) , but it is also happening now ( see the case of comet 73p above ) and it will continue taking place in the future .",
    "however , these events seem to provide just a small contribution to the present - day , overall amount of orbital coherence observed within the neo population although this contribution is in the form of the groupings with the highest statistical significance . in general , the results of our analysis are more consistent with secular resonances and the kozai mechanism being the sources of most of the observed dynamical coherence ; neos are being confined via resonances into specific paths with well - defined perihelia .",
    "it is now widely accepted that groups of objects moving initially in similar trajectories ( debris resulting from breakups ) lose all orbital coherence in a short time - scale ( pauls & gladman 2005 ; rubin & matson 2008 ; lai et al .",
    "in contrast , objects confined by resonances can remain together , dynamically speaking , for longer time - scales and those that are lost can be easily replaced via resonant capture .",
    "long - term stable asteroid streams could be real but not linked to discrete breakups but to the pervasive architecture of the neo orbital realm .",
    "the topic of impacts linked to groups of asteroids has been discussed in the past .",
    "halliday , blackwell & griffin ( 1990 ) provided early evidence for groups of meteor events and , within these groups , preference for perihelia just slightly inside the earth s orbit .",
    "data in their table 3 suggests that small impactors with values of @xmath4 in the range 1.72.5  au , @xmath5 in 0.40.6 , and @xmath6 in 012are more likely .",
    "based on halliday et al .",
    "( 1990 ) results , drummond ( 1991 ) found evidence for asteroid streams linked to the groups of meteor events . however , a more detailed study by fu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) concluded that it is unlikely that the streams found in drummond ( 1991 ) be anything more than random fluctuations in the orbital parameter space crossed by the neo population .",
    "benoit & sears ( 1995 ) used data on modern falls of chondrites and found that most meteorite parent bodies had @xmath106  au , with only a small fraction ( @xmath107 per cent ) having orbits with @xmath108  au .",
    "they observed a tendency for meteorites with large cosmic ray exposure ages ( @xmath109 myr ) to have shorter perihelia , @xmath110  au , than those with relatively short cosmic ray exposure ages , which tend to have perihelia between 0.85  au and 1.0  au .",
    "this may suggest that younger material tends to drift their perihelia towards the 0.851.0  au region , perhaps as a result of non - gravitational forces .",
    "alternatively , one may assume that smaller fragments should be , in general , younger than larger bodies and the groupings identified here include both large and very small bodies .",
    "large neo fragments ( size between 200  m and 700  m ) are unlikely to have been produced during the last few thousand years but meteoroids may have been ejected via e.g. rotational or tidal instability after the parent body has already been trapped within a web of secular resonances . in this scenario , neos with perihelia closer to the orbit of the earth are more likely to produce fragments which is a reasonable hypothesis .    figure [ mapsx ] , left - hand panel , in which the groups with the highest significance have two - to - three members links directly to the topic of unbound asteroid pairs ( see e.g vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2008 ; pravec & vokrouhlick 2009 ; pravec et al . 2010 ; moskovitz 2012 ; duddy et al .",
    "2013 ; polishook et al . 2014 ; wolters et al .",
    "bona fide unbound asteroid pairs have been found in the main asteroid belt .",
    "the type of analysis performed in fig . [ mapsx ] signals the presence of multiple candidate pairs among the neo population , although many of them could be just coincidental couples from the background asteroid population .",
    "in this paper , we have shown statistically that the distribution of the neo population in orbital parameter space is far from random . we have confirmed the presence of statistically significant dynamical groupings among the neo population that seem to be associated with the secular resonant architecture described in michel & froeschl ( 1997 ) . some of these dynamical groupings appear to have been the immediate sources of recent asteroid impact events and are likely to continue doing so in the future .",
    "the groupings host both relatively large ( size between 200  m and 700  m ) and very small ( a few metres ) objects which suggest that some of the smaller fragments may have been produced _ in situ _ via rotational instability or other mechanisms ( see e.g. denneau et al .",
    "production of meteoroids within the immediate neighbourhood of the earth has a direct impact on the evaluation of the overall asteroid impact hazard ( e.g. schunov et al .",
    "however and although this is of considerable theoretical interest , most of these fragments are small enough to be of less concern in practice .",

    "<S> the identification and subsequent study of groups of small neos that appear to move in similar trajectories are necessary steps in improving our understanding of the impact risk associated with meteoroids . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present results of a search for statistically significant dynamical groupings among the neo population . </S>",
    "<S> our monte carlo - based methodology recovers well - documented groupings like the taurid complex or the one resulting from the split comet 73p / schwassmann - wachmann 3 , and new ones that may have been the source of past impacts . among the most conspicuous </S>",
    "<S> are the mjolnir and ptah groups , perhaps the source of recent impact events like almahata sitta and chelyabinsk , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> meteoroid 2014  aa , that hit the earth on 2014  january  2 , could have its origin in a marginally significant grouping associated with bennu . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the substructure present within the orbital domain of the neos is of resonant nature , probably induced by secular resonances and the kozai mechanism that confine these objects into specific paths with well - defined perihelia .    </S>",
