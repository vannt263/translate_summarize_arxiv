    "recent years have seen an accumulation of data on muon - neutrino cross sections on nuclei at intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "these measurements have revealed interesting features in different reaction channels .",
    "for example , the charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) measurement performed by miniboone @xcite has attracted a lot of attention due to its unexpected behavior , reproducible with an unphysical value of the axial mass . this axial mass anomaly",
    "is now explained by the inclusion of events in which several nucleons are ejected in the ccqe cross section @xcite . in the one - pion production channel",
    "some questions are still open .",
    "for instance , various theoretical models @xcite can not simultaneously reproduce the miniboone @xcite and the minerva @xcite results .    the wealth of experimental and theoretical results on muon - neutrino cross sections contrasts with the few published results on electron - neutrino cross sections . after the inclusive @xmath0 cc total cross sections measured by the gargamelle bubble chamber in 1978 @xcite , the first measurement of inclusive @xmath0 cc differential cross sections on carbon was performed by t2k @xcite .",
    "recently the measurement performed by minerva of quasielastic and quasielastic - like differential cross sections on carbon also appeared @xcite .",
    "a precise knowledge of @xmath1 and @xmath0 cross sections is important in connection to the @xmath2 oscillation experiments which aim at the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy and the search for cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "a theoretical comparison of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cross sections was performed by day and mcfarland @xcite who analyzed the influence of the final lepton - mass difference on the cross sections as a function of the neutrino energy and of @xmath3 . here",
    "we study these differences focusing on the @xmath1 and @xmath0 differential cross sections . in a first part we consider the electron - neutrino cross sections on carbon using two different theoretical models .",
    "the first one is the one of martini _",
    "@xcite which is based on nuclear response functions , treated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) on top of a local relativistic fermi gas ( lrfg ) calculation .",
    "it includes the quasielastic cross section , multinucleon emission and coherent and incoherent single pion production .",
    "the second model is the one of jachowicz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which is based on the continuum random phase approximation ( crpa ) on top of hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations .",
    "it was originally developed to study electroweak reactions in the giant resonance region and then extended by pandey _",
    "@xcite to the quasielastic regime .",
    "the common channel where the two approaches can be compared is hence the quasielastic one .",
    "after a description of the two theoretical models , we confront their results in the quasielastic channel , first for fixed kinematics .",
    "we also illustrate in both models the differences between @xmath1 and @xmath0 cross sections .",
    "the difference between the two approaches manifests itself for small values of the neutrino energy ( @xmath4 200 mev ) .",
    "however when the cross sections are folded with the t2k and the miniboone @xmath0 fluxes which are peaked at @xmath4 500 mev it turns out that the differences are washed out . this justifies the use of the rpa approach of martini _",
    "et al . _ , which incorporates , beyond the quasielastic , one pion production and multinucleon emission to compare with the inclusive @xmath0 cc differential cross sections on carbon recently measured by t2k @xcite .",
    "we postpone the comparison with the very recent minerva results @xcite to a future paper .",
    "we summarize here the basic ingredients of the two models .",
    "both approaches calculate the polarization propagator @xmath5 in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) which allows the inclusion of long - range nucleon - nucleon correlations .",
    "this amounts to solving integral equations which have the generic form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the bare polarization propagator and @xmath8 denotes the effective particle - hole interaction . however , the bare polarization propagator and the residual interaction differ in the two approaches .    for martini _",
    "@xcite the _ bare _ polarization propagator is evaluated in momentum space . in a finite system",
    "it is non - diagonal and writes @xmath9 . in order to account for the finite - size effects ,",
    "it is evaluated in a semi - classical approximation @xcite where it can be cast in the form @xmath10 this semiclassical calculation is a wigner - kirwood expansion in @xmath11 restricted to first order .",
    "its validity has been explored by stroth _",
    "_ @xcite and by chanfray and schuck @xcite with the conclusion that the semiclassical description agrees with a quantum mechanical calculation but for small momenta ( @xmath12 mev / c for light nuclei ) .",
    "the non - diagonality in the momenta of @xmath13 shows that this description goes beyond the infinite nuclear matter one . in order to obtain the quantity in the integrand of eq .",

    "the density profile of @xmath17c is taken from the sum - of - gaussians nuclear charge density distribution parameters according to ref . @xcite . as for the collective rpa effects , the microscopic approach first introduced by delorme _",
    "@xcite is used .",
    "the method is described in detail in ref .",

    "the possibility of @xmath18-hole excitation is taken into account .    in the approach of jachowicz _",
    "@xcite , the starting point is the continuum hartree - fock model which evaluates the bound and the continuum single - nucleon wave functions through the solution of the schrdinger equation with a mean field potential .",
    "the bare polarization propagator , in this case the hf one , is then calculated in coordinate space . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the maximum multipole number to calculate the multipole operators is set to @xmath19 which turns out to be sufficient to reach the convergence of the cross sections .",
    "the particle - hole residual interaction differs as well in the two approaches . in the martini _",

    "is employed to generate the continuum rpa ( crpa ) solution . in this way , the calculation becomes self - consistent with respect to the interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite this residual skyrme - type interaction is multiplied by a dipole form factor which controls the influence of the residual interaction at high @xmath3 values @xcite . at variance with respect to ref.@xcite , here the crpa results are not folded with a lorentz function which would spread the strength of giant - resonances without modification of the position of the quasielastic peak .    concerning the rpa differences ,",
    "an important point should be mentioned .",
    "the possibility of @xmath18-hole excitation in the rpa chain is included explicitly in the case of martini _",
    "_ this is reflected in the appearance in certain kinematical regions of a sizable quenching in the rpa results , due to the mixing of nucleon - hole states with @xmath18-hole ones , the ericson - ericson  lorentz - lorenz ( eell ) effect @xcite .",
    "this quenching has been introduced and established in pion scattering @xcite .",
    "it has been discussed also in relation with electron @xcite and neutrino @xcite scattering .",
    "in this subsection , we compare the theoretical results in the one nucleon - one hole sector obtained in the two different approaches .",
    "we consider the @xmath0-@xmath17c double differential cross sections for different values of the neutrino energy and lepton scattering angle .",
    "these cross sections are purely theoretical quantities since the experimental ones depend on the neutrino fluxes and hence are specific for each experiment . in fig.[fig_lfgrpa_vsmfcrpa ] we display the results of the two approaches by switching on and off the residual particle - hole interaction .",
    "we keep the same notations as in the previous papers of the groups .",
    "namely we call `` bare - lrfg '' the results of martini _ et al .",
    "_ when the particle - hole interaction is switched off ( these are relativistic fermi gas results in the local density approximation ) and `` rpa '' the results obtained by switching on the particle - hole interaction . the corresponding results in the case of jachowicz _ et al .",
    "_ are called `` hf '' and `` crpa '' .",
    "some important differences between the two approaches appear .",
    "the most striking feature is the appearance of giant resonance peaks in the crpa results of jachowicz _ et al .",
    "_ they vanish for large neutrino energy or larger scattering angle .",
    "the second comment concerns the threshold energy in the hf+crpa approach , about @xmath34 18 mev , which reflects the nucleon separation energy , ignored in the semi - classical approximation of martini _",
    "_ the hf+crpa results also display the shell structure , which is not present in the semiclassical description .",
    "it disappears at large angles or energies , where the two approaches become similar .",
    "however , when compared to the semiclassical lrfg results , in the mean field hf case the quasielastic peak is somewhat quenched and the high transferred - energy tail is more important . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite this is a consequence of the non - locality of the mean field which has a similar effect as the residual transverse repulsive ph interaction : it quenches and hardens the responses .    turning to rpa effects ,",
    "the important difference is the large rpa quenching in the martini _",
    "approach , due to the mixing with @xmath18-hole states that we have commented before , not explicitly present in the crpa results of jachowicz _ et al .",
    "_ for completeness the rpa results without the @xmath18-hole mixing ( the eell effect ) are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_lfgrpa_vsmfcrpa ] . in this",
    "context further comments are in order .",
    "the particle - hole force which enters in the rpa chain , as given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) , ( [ eq : interaction_two ] ) , decreases with the momentum transfer .",
    "this is apparent in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_lfgrpa_vsmfcrpa ] from the differences between the bare ( lrfg ) and rpa cases with or without the eell effect .",
    "notice also that the influence of the rpa in the approach of jachowicz _ et al .",
    "_ in the larger momentum cases , even if small , is similar to the one of the martini _",
    "_ without the eell effect : it leads to a small quenching and hardening of the cross section .",
    "this behavior is less evident at low momentum transfer , where the main difference between hf and crpa is in the appearance of the giant resonances , however one can notice a hardening of the strength in the crpa tails .    in order to better illustrate the comparison between the two approaches , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_cfr_d2s_200_500_750_rpa_only ] the lrfg and rpa results shifted by 18 mev , an average value of the separation energy , and we compare them with the hf and crpa results respectively . for the structureless part of the cross sections , _",
    "i.e. _ for the kinematical conditions such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 mev or @xmath37 and @xmath38 mev , the two approaches are essentially in agreement",
    ". furthermore the hf or crpa cross sections are characterized by a stronger tail at high transferred energies , an effect , as mentioned before , of the non - locality of the mean field .",
    "it turns out that , in the low - energy part , the rpa results ( which do not show giant resonance peaks ) represent the average of the crpa calculations relatively well , in spite of the fact that the semi - classical approach is not expected to be valid in this region , which corresponds to low transferred momenta .",
    "another interesting information concerns the main multipoles contributing to the crpa cross sections , in particular for the resonant structures . to illustrate this point we plot in fig .  [ fig_multipoles ] the three major multipole contributions to the cross sections in the four kinematical conditions of figs .",
    "[ fig_lfgrpa_vsmfcrpa ] and [ fig_cfr_d2s_200_500_750_rpa_only ] . as it clearly appears , at low neutrino energy and forward scattering angles , the cross section , with its giant resonance structures",
    "is dominated by the @xmath39 and @xmath40 multipole contributions .",
    "on the contrary at larger energies and scattering angles the contribution of the various multipoles is more evenly distributed , as discussed in ref .",
    "one can appreciate this point by noticing that the first three major multipole contributions are of the same order of magnitude and are not dominant , hence one needs to include all multipole contributions up to @xmath19 with natural and unnatural parity .",
    "turning to the flux folded cross sections we consider the t2k @xcite and miniboone @xcite @xmath0 normalized fluxes , which are shown in fig .",

    "we discuss single - differential quasielastic cross sections , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , their theoretical evaluation is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_ds_fold_mb_t2k_rpa_crpa ] .",
    "one observes that the giant resonance effects are no longer apparent in the crpa and that in general the differences between hf and crpa calculations are largely washed out by the flux folding .",
    "moreover in the case of miniboone fluxes the hf or crpa results are very similar to the lrfg ones while the rpa curves , which are somewhat below , display the usual eell quenching . the results without this eell quenching are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ds_fold_mb_t2k_rpa_crpa ] . in the t2k case instead",
    "some small differences appear : the hf and crpa results are above the corresponding lrfg cross section .",
    "this difference , which did not show with the miniboone flux , is the effect of the larger t2k high energy tail .",
    "the differences between the two different theoretical models are weighted in different ways by the different flux profiles .",
    "but in general the differences between the various models are small and beyond the present level of experimental accuracy .               and @xmath1 scattering corresponding to the kinematical conditions of fig .

    "the sum of transverse contributions , including the vector - axial interference term , is labeled as t. these are the terms containing the isospin spin - transverse response in the language of refs .  @xcite .",
    "as one can observe in fig.[fig_nue_numu_crpa_cl_t_e200_final ] , for @xmath43=200 mev and @xmath48=5 degrees ( and in general for very forward scattering ) the neutrino cross section is dominated by the cl contribution while for larger angles , such as 60 degrees , the transverse contribution t is dominant . at larger energies the transverse part dominates everywhere except for very small scattering angles . at @xmath43=200 mev and @xmath49",

    "can be considered only as a first approximation in the study of the @xmath0 interactions .    concerning the comparison with experiment , we have considered the inclusive @xmath0 t2k flux - folded single - differential cross sections on carbon where the inclusion of np - nh and pion production effects beyond the genuine quasielastic is mandatory . for this reason",
    "we have compared the data with the only rpa - based approach of martini _ et al . _ which includes all these channels .",
    "we have found a good agreement with the data .",
    "this success obtained with a new flux , the @xmath0 t2k one , complements those already reached with the three different fluxes , such as the miniboone @xmath1 and @xmath66 , and t2k @xmath1 ones .",
