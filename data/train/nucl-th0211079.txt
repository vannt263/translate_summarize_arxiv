    "electromagnetic and weak transitions provide important probes of nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "exact numerical solutions of the many - body schrdinger equation are very difficult , so theorists have devised a number of approximations .",
    "transitions offer a serious test of the model wavefunctions , not only in comparison to experiment but also between approximations .",
    "one of the most successful approximations is the interacting shell model ( sm ) , which diagonalizes an effective hamiltonian in a restricted space , providing good description of the observed low lying states for a wide range of mass numbers .",
    "the sm wavefunctions successfully describe electromagnetic and weak transitions , in good agreement ( albeit sometimes requiring effective couplings ) with the experimental data ; for this reason , in this paper we consider sm results to be exact . due to the computational burden which increases with mass number ,",
    "however , full @xmath0 sm calculations are presently limited to light and medium nuclei ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "another approximation , which works surprisingly well considering its simplicity , is mean - field theory , e.g. , hartree - fock ( hf ) theory . in this approach ,",
    "the particles are uncorrelated and move in an average potential which replaces the two - body interaction ; the ground state is determined by energy minimization .",
    "starting from the hf solution , the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) constructs excited states by assuming them to be mixtures of one particle , one hole ( 1p-1h ) configurations .",
    "the hf+tda is the simplest model for ground and excited state wavefunctions .",
    "there are also limitations of this model : the ground state wavefunction is a single slater determinant which can break symmetries of the hamiltonian and neglects particle - hole correlations arising from the residual interaction @xcite .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) is a generalization of the tda , which takes into account the residual interaction by adding 2p-2h correlations in the ground state .",
    "( an important extension is the quasiparticle rpa or qrpa ; because it accounts for nonperturbative pairing effects , it is often considered a superior approach . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to number - conserving rpa . )",
    "the excited states , as in the tda , remain 1p-1h mixtures .",
    "is this the case ?",
    "that is , are the excited states _ mainly _ mixtures of 1p-1h correlations ?",
    "the answer is no : one knows from sm calculations that , for example , the first excited state in @xmath2o has a predominant 4p-4h character @xcite , outside the rpa model space .",
    "is therefore no surprise that rpa fails in these situations .    despite known limitations ,",
    "the rpa ( or qrpa ) has been widely applied for decades to evaluate spectra and transition strengths in nuclei .",
    "the reason , aside from computational simplicity , is that it is frequently , although not always @xcite , in close agreement with experiment .",
    "thus , rpa was the method of choice for description of negative parity states in closed shell nuclei @xcite and in open shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "rpa and qrpa calculations ( sometimes including continuum states ) using phenomenological interactions have been successful in describing the experimental position of giant resonances @xcite , particularly e1 @xcite and m1 @xcite from electron or proton scattering , or gamow - teller resonances @xcite . in general , however , the description of low - lying transitions is poor @xcite .",
    "other studies have used qrpa to compute transitions of interest for astrophysics but did not directly compare to experiment @xcite .    what about tests of rpa against exact models ? until recently there was no thorough test of the hf+rpa against an exact non - trivial model for binding energies .",
    "we performed such a test for a large number of nuclei and found that in general hf+rpa is a good approximation to the exact shell - model binding energy @xcite , although with some significant failures .",
    "tests of transitions have been also mainly against ` toy ' models @xcite , although the qrpa has been tested against exact diagonalization in the full sm space for @xmath3 or double @xmath4 decays @xcite , with mixed success .",
    "broader tests of rpa transitions strengths against an exact model , e.g. , sm , has not been done . to address this issue",
    ", this paper tests the rpa against full @xmath0 calculation for several nuclei in the _ sd _ and _ pf _ shells for electromagnetic transitions . unlike previous tests however",
    ", we consider mean - field solutions which break the rotational symmetry .    we find that , in general , the rpa produces a reasonable approximation to the exact ( sm ) transitions .",
    "the most significant failures are for certain low - lying collective states .",
    "we understand these failures through the incomplete restoration of broken symmetries and the nature of collective giant resonances .",
    "the brown - bosterli schematic model @xcite provides insight into giant collective resonances .",
    "it assumes the model hamiltonian to be single - particle energies plus a separable residual interaction . in both the tda and the rpa ,",
    "all of the brown - bosterli transition strength is to a single state , the collective state , which is a model for giant resonances .",
    "if the residual interaction is repulsive , then the collective state will be at high energy .",
    "if the interaction is attractive , then the collective state will be low in energy . in more realistic models , of course , the residual interaction includes more complicated two - body forces , causing the giant resonance to spread over many states .",
    "the important lesson of the brown - bosterli model , however , is that an attractive interaction , such as isoscalar quadrupole - quadrupole , leads to large collective transitions low in the spectrum , while repulsive interactions , such as @xmath5 , produce collective transitions lying higher in the spectrum .",
    "breaking of symmetries can result in low - lying collectivity being subsumed into the ground state .",
    "for example , the strongly attractive isoscalar quadrupole - quadrupole interaction leads to a quadrupole deformation in the hf state .",
    "while the rpa identifies broken symmetries , restoration of symmetry is incomplete .",
    "this point is not fully explicated or understood in the literature , but our calculations here provide further evidence , as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : upen ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] presents briefly the interacting sm and the rpa formalisms , with emphasis on their application to transition strengths . in sec .",
    "[ sec : compstr ] we compare the sm and rpa transition strengths and distribution properties for several nuclides , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize results . in the appendix we consider in some detail the effect of breaking of exact symmetries on transition strength sum rules .",
    "in this section we briefly present the treatment of transitions in both sm and rpa . before giving any specific details , we review some general concepts .",
    "a primary goal is , given the hamiltonian @xmath6 , to calculate solutions to the eigenvalue equation @xmath7 suppose we have solved eq .",
    "( [ eq : eig ] ) , either in the sm or rpa . the transition strength from an excited to the ground - state",
    "is given by the square of the matrix element , @xmath8 while the quantity @xmath9 is the ( energy weighted ) sum rule of order @xmath10 .",

    "then properly the total strength in eq .",

    "the number of possible many - body configurations is restricted by two means : first , one assumes that only a limited number of nucleons interact ( valence particles ) , the rest forming an inert core , and second , the active particles are restricted to a small number of single particle states ( valence space ) .",
    "usually , the valence space is restricted to a major oscillator shell .",
    "diagonalization of an effective hamiltonian provides the low lying states by means of the lanczos algorithm @xcite ; the corresponding wavefunctions are eigenstates of the parity , total angular momentum and isospin .",
    "the reduction of the available single particle states and active particles makes the diagonalization numerically tractable .",
    "there is a downside though : in order to take into account the restriction of the hilbert space one has to use modified ( effective ) operators to describe observables or transitions . in many cases a simple phenomenological use of",
    "either enhanced or quenched couplings , most famously the former for e2 transitions and the latter for gamow - teller transitions , yields good agreement with experiment .    in order to calculate transition strengths in sm ,",
    "we have used the lanczos moment method : the transition operator is applied on the initial state wavefunction .",
    "then , the newly obtained state is used as the starting state , or pivot , for diagonalization by means of the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the size of the pivot vector is the total transition strength @xmath14 , and the overlap of the pivot with the final eigenstate , which it turns out can be read off trivially , is the transition amplitude .",
    "the interested reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "several textbooks @xcite cover the rpa , so we skip detailed derivation and just review principal steps .",
    "the starting point of the rpa is a self - consistent mean - field solution , a slater determinant which can break symmetries and which ignores correlations .",
    "this determines a deformed particle - hole basis , where the occupation numbers are zero for particle states and one for hole states .",
    "the rpa ground state is defined as the vacuum for a set of quasiboson operators , @xmath27 while the excited states , approximate solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eig ] ) , are given by @xmath28 and because we assume the excited states to be 1p-1h correlations , one writes the quasiboson creation operators as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the approximate boson mapping of the ( deformed ) fermion operators .",
    "we use the conventional notation that @xmath31 , @xmath32 are unoccupied ( particle ) states , while @xmath33 , @xmath34 are occupied ( hole ) states , respectively . note that while in eq .",
    "( [ exstrpa ] ) the first terms describe particle - hole correlations on top of the hf state , the terms @xmath35 describe correlations coming from 2p-2h configurations in the ground state . in the rpa",
    "one assumes that the ground state is still very close to the hf solution , so that the hole - particle amplitudes @xmath36 are much smaller than the particle - hole amplitudes @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the eigenvalue equation @xmath38 determines the excitation energies @xmath39 and the particle - hole @xmath37 and hole - particle amplitudes @xmath36 . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are matrices given by @xmath42 \\right ] \\right | hf   \\right \\rangle , \\label{defa}\\ ] ] @xmath43 , \\hat{c}^\\dagger_m \\hat{c}_i \\right ] \\right | hf   \\right \\rangle .",

    "in addition , if the hartree - fock state is invariant under some particle - hole transformation , such as rotation about an axis , this corresponds to a zero frequency rpa mode .",
    "thus , the generators of symmetries broken by a mean - field solution are eigenvectors of eq .",
    "( [ rpamatrix ] ) lying at at zero excitation energy .",
    "this is frequently interpreted as `` approximate restoration of broken symmetries '' @xcite ; in fact , it is more accurate to say that the rpa _ respects _ symmetries by separating out exactly spurious motion . in sec .",
    "[ sec : compstr ] we present evidence that significant part of the quadrupole response for even - even nuclei is still retained in the ground state , which suggests that broken symmetries are only partially restored by the rpa .",

    "[ sec : compstr ] compares the sm and rpa predictions for these quantities , as well as individual transition strengths in several nuclei . before proceeding with our numerical results , there are two points to discuss .",
    "first , the energy - weighted sum rule @xmath24 .",

    "[ sec : ewsr ] we confirm the violation numerically , and find the worse case to be where the bulk of the transition strength lies very low in energy , such as isoscalar e2 .",
    "this appears to be a new result . because applications of rpa have usually assumed spherical symmetry they are not invalidated , but ambitious rpa calculations that allowed for broken symmetries in the mean - field @xcite should be approached with caution . of particular interest , which we have not yet explored , is the qrpa which breaks particle number conservation .    a second point we would like to discuss",
    "involves ground - state to ground - state transitions .",
    "( these are nothing more than ground - state expectation values of non - scalar operators .",
    "we discuss ground state expectation values of _ scalar _ operators in @xcite ; in principle one can extend such calculations to non - scalar operators , but we have not yet done so .",
    "marshalek and weneser @xcite discuss expectation values for electric quadrupole and magnetic moments , but their approach is not very transparent for general implementation . ) most discussions of the rpa do not give a well - defined procedure to calculate such transitions , in part because they vanish when the hartree - fock state has spherical symmetry . while such g.s .",
    "transitions are forbidden for a spherical ( hence @xmath51 ) state , they are in general not forbidden for nonspherical hf states . if rpa does not fully restore broken symmetries , a significant contribution to the total strength could be absorbed into otherwise forbidden g.s .  to g.s .",
    "we investigate in detail this point in sec .",
    "[ sec : downen ] , and indeed we find that significant strength to excited states can be missing for even - even nuclides .",
    "in order to test the rpa reliability for computing transition strengths , we calculate both the mean - field and exact solutions in the same model space , using the same hamiltonian .",
    "we work in full @xmath0 shell model spaces , restricting the single particle states to one major shell .",
    "most of our examples were computed in the @xmath52 shell , limiting the nucleons outside an inert @xmath2o core to the single particle orbits @xmath53-@xmath54-@xmath55 . additionally , we considered two nuclei , @xmath56ti and @xmath57v , in the @xmath58 shell , i.e. , @xmath59 single particle states outside @xmath60ca core . for the interaction",
    ", we used the wildenthal `` usd '' in the @xmath52 shell @xcite and the monopole - modified kuo - brown `` kb3 '' in the @xmath58 shell @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that due to our restriction to a single major shell and limitation to mixing angular degrees of freedom , the mean - field solution can break only the rotational symmetry .    for testing purposes",
    ", we have considered @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , that is isoscalar ( @xmath63 ) and isovector ( @xmath64 ) electric quadrupole ( e2 ) . while good agreement with experimental transitions strengths requires nontrivial effective proton and neutron charges ,",
    "the main contribution of effective charges is a rescaling of the strengths ; therefore for simplicity we took the bare charges , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this might appear to suggest that we only considered the proton response , but we computed the isoscalar and isovector responses separately , that is , incoherently ( only if the isoscalar and isovector responses were summed coherently would one have pure proton response ) .",
    "in addition , we tested transition distributions for spin flip ( sf ) and gamow - teller ( gt ) which are the isoscalar and isovector components of the spin operator @xmath67 . to avoid confusion , note that the actual gt operator we used is @xmath68 so that @xmath69 was conserved .",
    "a large fraction application of rpa calculations are to e1 transitions .",
    "because our shell model valence space does not include single - particle states of opposite parity , we could not investigate e1 transitions here .      in this section",
    "we show results for isovector e2 , sf ( spin - flip ) and gt ( gamow - teller ) transition operators .",
    "the main common feature is that their collective transitions lie relatively high in energy .",
    "we find that for such transitions the rpa is in reasonably good agreement with the sm results , especially for the total transition strength .",

    "the excitation spectra are discrete , but to guide the eye we folded in a gaussian of width 0.7 mev .",
    "in addition , tables [ table : e2iv]-[table : gt ] summarize the results in both sm and rpa for several nuclei ; we present only the total strengths , the centroids and the widths of the distributions .",
    "the figures show that the rpa calculations follow the general features of the sm transition strength distributions .",
    "note however that by comparison to sm , the rpa distributions have smaller widths ( see tables [ table : e2iv]-[table : gt ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising , as higher - order particle - hole correlations are expected to further fragment the distribution .",
    "the rpa centroids are generally shifted to lower energies than the sm . although the centroids are related to the energy - weighted sum rule @xmath24 , we remind the reader that we do not violate eq .",
    "( [ genewsr1 ] ) because the hf state is only an approximation to the ground state .",
    "furthermore , the shift in the centroid does not appear correlated with the correctness of the rpa estimations of the ground state energy @xcite or other observables @xcite .",
    "one might expect that the correct inclusion of the pairing interaction by means of hfb+qrpa would improve the results .",
    "this is reasonable and worth trying , but see discussion and caveats regarding pairing and qrpa in @xcite .    for computational simplicity",

    "but because the rotations about @xmath73 or @xmath74 axis are complex , for odd - odd or odd-@xmath40 nuclei the rpa does not identify all the corresponding generators as exactly zero - frequency modes .",
    "instead , we obtain a ` soft ' mode at very low excitation energy .",
    "transition strengths to the soft mode are in fact ground - state - to - ground - state strength normally not computed in rpa .",

    "we have computed the rpa and shell model strength distributions in the same @xmath0 shell model space .",
    "the comparison between rpa and sm showed two different results , depending upon the nature of transitions .",
    "thus , we found that when the strong collectivity lies at high energies , such as isovector e2 , sf and gt transitions , the rpa and sm are in reasonable agreement . when the transitions lie at low energies however , the agreement is poor .",
    "we presented evidence that the problem arises from an incomplete restoration of the symmetries broken by the mean - field ; for low - lying transitions we propose that significant part of the transition strength is subsumed into the rpa ground state .",
