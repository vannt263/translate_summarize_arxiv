    "the @xmath6cdm model according to which our universe is a friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time with flat spatial sections containing approximately 3% baryonic matter , 24% cold dark matter , the rest being given by the contribution of a cosmological constant @xmath7 seems to be in excellent agreement with current observational data .",
    "as the dark sector ( dark matter and dark energy - a generalization of the vacuum expectation energy represented by the cosmological constant ) remains unknown , alternate gravitational theories have been advanced .",
    "the string - theory motivated brane - world models contain our observable universe as a time - evolving 3-dimensional brane embedded in a 5-dimensional bulk .",
    "standard model fields act on the brane , but gravity is allowed to leak into the fifth dimension @xcite , where non - standard model fields could also exist ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the projection of the 5-dimensional einstein equation onto the brane generates an effective einstein equation with new source terms as compared to general relativity @xcite , @xcite .    among them , the energy - momentum squared source term modifies early cosmology @xcite and becomes important during the final stages of gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "it behaves as the dominant source term before the bing bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "this quadratic source term is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the value of the brane tension @xmath9 is constrained by the deviation from the gravitational newton - law still compatible with nowadays rigurous experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the emerging high value of @xmath9 and the fast decrease of the square of the energy density of matter implies that in a cosmological context this source term can be safely ignored at present time .",
    "the weyl curvature of the bulk gives rise to a non - local bulk effect on the brane , appearing as fluid on the brane ( the weyl fluid ) . in the simplest case ,",
    "when the bulk is static , the weyl fluid is a radiation field ( dark radiation ) .",
    "this situation represents an equilibrium configuration , without any energy exchange between the brane and the bulk .",
    "bbn constraints the amounts of the energy density of the dark radiation as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath11 is the dimensionless dark radiation energy density parameter . )",
    "more generic weyl fluids were also considered @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "depending on how this weyl fluid evolves , its present day amount can be either negligible or not .",
    "it is this aspect we wish to consider here , based on our previous analysis @xcite-@xcite .",
    "various brane - world models were confronted with supernova data @xcite-@xcite , however in all these models the contribution of weyl fluid was dropped , assuming it was pure dark radiation during all stages all the cosmological evolution . in our analysis we keep the contribution of the ( non - radiation like ) weyl fluid .",
    "we already gave the analytical expression in terms of elliptical integrals for the luminosity distance when the weyl contribution is small @xcite and can be considered a perturbation .",
    "then we have tested the models with weyl fluid characterizing a bulk - brane energy exchange , by comparing their predictions with the best available supernova data @xcite . here",
    "we present additional analysis and strenghten our conclusions .",
    "our model consists of a spatially flat flrw brane embedded symmetrically into a 5-dimensional vaidya - anti de sitter bulk .",
    "the latter has a cosmological constant @xmath12 , black holes with masses @xmath13 on either sides of the brane and radiation . if the radiation is swithced off , @xmath13 is constant , and the bulk becomes schwarzschild - anti de sitter . in this configuration",
    "the weyl fluid appears as dark radiation on the brane ( with energy density @xmath14 ) .",
    "any radiation escaping from the brane causes @xmath13 to vary .",
    "the ansatz @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , comparable with structure formation has been recently advanced @xcite .",
    "the brane coupling constant @xmath17 is related to the coupling constant in the bulk @xmath18 and brane tension @xmath9 as @xmath19 .",
    "the relation between the brane tension and the bulk and the brane cosmological constant @xmath6 is 2@xmath20 .",
    "we introduce the following dimensionless quantities : @xmath21 where @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the huble parameter , @xmath24 is the matter energy density on the brane and @xmath25 is the scale factor .",
    "the subscript @xmath26 denotes the present value of the respective quantities .",
    "the friedmann equation written in these parameters becomes @xmath27 . at present time this gives @xmath28 .",
    "the luminosity distance for the spatially flat flrw brane becomes @xmath29 ^{1/2}}\\ .",
    "\\label{chi2}\\ ] ] the above complicated integral has no analytical form in the majority of cases .",
    "however for small @xmath4 and ( as noted earlier ) ) vanishing @xmath30 this integral could be given analytically as @xmath31 , where the coefficient @xmath32 is an analytic expression of elementary functions and elliptic integrals of the first and second kind @xcite , having different forms depending on the actual value of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the data selects among the brane - world models with @xmath35 a global minimum at @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath5 .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath38 is in perfect agreement with the wmap 3-year data @xcite .",
    "the 1-@xmath39 and 2-@xmath39 confidence levels are shown of fig[fig1 ] in the @xmath40 plane . the @xmath6cdm model is contained in the 2-@xmath41 cofidence level at @xmath42 .",
    "the forbidden ( white ) region appears because the friedmann equation combined with @xmath28 gives constraints on the allowed range of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the cases @xmath44 and @xmath45 are represented on fig[fig2 ] and fig[fig3 ] , respectively . in these cases",
    "the determination of the global minimum becomes unreliable , as the 1-@xmath41 contours become much elongated .",
    "instead of a peak we have a trough , which lies aslope in the @xmath46-@xmath47 plane . together with the increase in @xmath0",
    "the 1-@xmath41 contour becomes more elongated and turning counter - clock - wise .",
    "this feature of the 1-@xmath41 contours indicates that with increasing @xmath0 the models become more likely to be compatible with the available supernova data , irrelevant of the exact ( but small ) value of @xmath4 .",
    "this practically means that any small amount of weyl fluid with @xmath48 is perfectly compatible with supernova data .    in the investigated models the weyl fluid is either dark radiation ( @xmath49 ) or describes a situation when the brane radiates into the bulk , feeding the bulk black holes ( @xmath48 ) . in the latter cases",
    "the energy density of the weyl fluid decreases slower , than that of matter , therefore a sizeable weyl fluid contribution nowasays is perfectly compatible with bbn constraints .",
    "for @xmath35 the weyl fluid evolves as radiation , therefore the bbn constraints can be satisfied only with an infinitesimal amount of dark radiation nowadays",
    ". the preferred value of @xmath50 would give too much dark radiation in the past .",
    "however if we assume that @xmath49 is only a recent characteristic of the brane , this equilibrium situation being preceded by an epoch in which the brane is allowed to radiate , the bbn constraints can be obeyed with a small , but non - negligible amount of dark radiation nowadays .",
    "the bbn contraint @xcite can be satisfied @xcite , if the brane radiates in the interval ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath53 the constraint for @xmath52 with different value of @xmath0 gives @xmath54 6114.20 for @xmath55 , @xmath54 155.40 for @xmath56 , @xmath54 45.08 for @xmath57 , @xmath54 24.01 for @xmath58 .",
    "thus the known history of the universe can be explained if the brane radiates during at least some period of the cosmological evolution . at early times",
    "the radiation of the brane leads to a black hole , which can further grow during structure formation .",
    "none of the investigated models , compatible with the available supernova data and structure formation , can be excluded by present observational accuracy .",
    "the differences among the predictions of the models are however increasing with redshift , therefore future measurements of very far supernovae will be able to either support or falsify these cosmological models .",
