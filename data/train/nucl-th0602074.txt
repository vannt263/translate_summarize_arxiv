    "<S> in the phenomenological description of the nuclear interaction a crucial role is traditionally played by the exchange of a scalar i=0 meson , the sigma , of mass 500 - 600 mev , which however is not seen clearly in the particle spectrum and which has a very ambiguous status in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> i show that a remarkably simple and reasonably controlled combination of ingredients can reproduce the features of this part of the nuclear force . </S>",
    "<S> the use of chiral perturbation theory calculations for two pion exchange supplemented by the omnes function for pion rescattering suffices to reproduce the magnitude and shape of the exchange of a supposed @xmath0 particle , even though no such particle is present in this calculation . </S>",
    "<S> i also show how these ingredients can describe the contact interaction that enters more modern descriptions of the internucleon interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> when describing qcd to non - physicists , we generally say that it is the theory that accounts for nuclear binding . however , in practice our understanding of the precise way that qcd leads to nuclear bound states is still not good . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear binding is traditionally described by an internucleon potential which can be parameterized by the exchange of mesons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most important exchange producing binding in the central potential is a scalar isoscalar meson , the sigma , of mass around 500 - 600 mev . </S>",
    "<S> while other exchanges in the potential are correlated with clear resonances seen in the particle spectrum , the sigma is a puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> it is not seen in the usual way in the spectrum and , after 40 years of debate , does not have a clear interpretation in terms of the quarks and gluons of qcd scattering describing the sigma as a pole on second sheet , quite far from the real axis , is found in @xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is unfortunate that the key ingredient in the signature effect of the strong interactions has such an ambiguous status .    </S>",
    "<S> the expectation is that the sigma represents , in some way , the exchange of two pions . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum numbers certainly are correct for this . </S>",
    "<S> sophisticated attempts that construct the potential from scattering data ( e.g. @xcite ) have two pions as the lightest intermediate state . </S>",
    "<S> however , while phenomenologically useful , these are not able to answer the question of the fundamental nature of the sigma effect . </S>",
    "<S> modern descriptions of the internucleon interaction use chiral perturbation theory to calculate two pion exchange at low energy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these do not produce the sigma effect because the chiral amplitudes grow monotonically with the energy . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i add a simple and well - motivated addition to the chiral description , i.e. the omnes function describing pion rescattering . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that this will produce an interaction remarkably close in structure to the exchange of a 600 mev sigma meson . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that there is no resonance in this description , yet the needed properties of sigma exchange are reproduced .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , there have been successful applications of ideas of effective field theory in which the nuclear interaction is treated not by potentials but by contact interactions - delta function interactions@xcite . at low energy </S>",
    "<S> ( recall that the energy typical of nuclear binding is 10 mev / nucleon ) the result of the exchange of a heavy particle can be described by a local interaction . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , this is consistent with the potential description because , as the mass @xmath1 gets large , the yukawa potential forms a representation of a delta function . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this follows from the uncertainty principle , as the exchange of a heavy particle has a short range . </S>",
    "<S> nonlocality , to the extent it is needed , can then be described by contact derivative interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this development greatly increases the generality of the description of nuclei , as it reduces multiple potentials with different functional forms to a small number of constants giving the strengths of the contact interactions . </S>",
    "<S> i will also show how the use of chiral perturbation theory plus the omnes function can provide a reasonably controlled calculation of the i = 0 scalar contact interaction .    in qcd , </S>",
    "<S> the low energy interactions of two nucleons obeys an unsubtracted dispersion relation in the different partial waves@xcite specializing to the scalar isoscalar channel , we can write the momentum space and coordinate space interaction as @xmath2 here @xmath3 describes the physical intermediate states that occur at energy @xmath4 in the crossed channel . the threshold occurs at twice the pion mass and the lowest energy intermediate state is two pions .    at low energy </S>",
    "<S> these spectral functions can be rigorously calculated in chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of the feynman diagrams describe the physical intermediate states and generate the spectral function @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> fmftwopion @xmath5 @xmath6    @xmath7    for the diagrams of figs 1 a , b , c these imaginary parts are@xcite @xmath8\\frac{(\\mu^2 - 2m_\\pi^2)}{\\mu}~\\theta ( \\mu -2m_\\pi)\\ ] ] @xmath9 ^ 2 + \\frac{c_2 ^ 2}{45}(\\mu^2 - 4 m_\\pi^2)^2\\right)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 are parameters that describe the @xmath11 vertex - these have been measured in pion nucleon interactions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> i will address the box and crossed box diagrams below . </S>",
    "<S> these spectral functions are valid in the low energy regime only , and one observes that they grow monotonically with the energy .    </S>",
    "<S> however , there is another ingredient which necessarily enters . in the description of the @xmath12 system </S>",
    "<S> , unitarity requires the inclusion of @xmath12 rescattering . for a single elastic partial wave , unitarity of the s matrix and analyticity </S>",
    "<S> require a unique form of the solution , given originally by omnes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes in the elastic region are described by a polynomial in the energy times the omnes function @xmath13\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the @xmath12 scattering phase shift , in our case for the i=0 , j=0 channel . </S>",
    "<S> chiral perturbation theory is consistent with this order by order in the energy expansion . </S>",
    "<S> following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is known how to match this general description to the results of chiral perturbation theory by appropriately identifying the polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic region in this channel extends effectively up to energies of 1000 mev .    in practice </S>",
    "<S> there has been good success at using the lowest order chiral amplitudes , supplemented by the omnes function . </S>",
    "<S> an example close to the present problem is @xmath15 in the s wave . here a lowest order calculation supplemented with an omnes function@xcite yields results in close agreement with both experiment and with a two loop chiral calculation up to energies beyond 700 mev@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> i will adopt the omnes solution matched to the leading order chiral result , and will explore possible modifications below . </S>",
    "<S> the description of the spectral function then becomes @xmath16 the phase shifts can be analyzed in chiral perturbation theory in combination with experiment , with the definitive treatment of colangelo et al ( cgl)@xcite . their result for the i = 0 , j=0 phase shift is shown in fig 2 , along with the resulting omnes functions . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is no sigma resonance in the phase shift near 300 - 600 mev . </S>",
    "<S> a resonance in the elastic region is manifest by the phase shift passing through 90 degrees , which certainly does not happen near the sigma mass . </S>",
    "<S> ( if one explores the complex plane there is a pole on the second sheet very far from the real axis@xcite . ) in producing the omnes function , i had to extend the phase shifts above the @xmath4 = 850 mev endpoint of the cgl analysis in order that the principle value part of the omnes function integral be well behaved near the upper end . </S>",
    "<S> as long as this extension is smooth it has little effect on this calculation .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +   +   +    @xmath17    with these ingredients , we can display the result for the scalar interaction . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , i show the result for @xmath18 , along with the individual contributions of the diagrams of fig 1 . if we had a pure sigma exchange this would be delta function at the mass of the @xmath0 , or a breit - wigner shape corresponding to a narrow resonance </S>",
    "<S> . one could be forgiven for seeing this result as a very broad resonance , even though no resonance exists in the formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate space potential is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . also shown for comparison is the potential of an infinitely narrow 600 mev scalar with a normalization chosen to match . in practice </S>",
    "<S> these are hard to differentiate because the curves are nearly identical . </S>",
    "<S> the simple description of eq . </S>",
    "<S> 5 reproduces closely the spatial variation of the sigma potential . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the interaction will be addressed below .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +   +   +   +    @xmath19    one can address the robustness of this result by considering possible higher order modifications of the basic representation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 interaction has been described by the lowest order chiral lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> there are also energy dependent modifications to these low order results . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we expect that there might be form factors depending on the energy . to probe this effect , </S>",
    "<S> let as modify the @xmath12 interaction by a form factor . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 the choice of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . while the relative contribution of the two diagrams change ( since the latter has the form factor squared ) and the magnitude is different , the energy variation and spatial variation are remarkably similar to the original case . </S>",
    "<S> use of a dipole form factor does not change this conclusion .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +   +   +     + @xmath23 +    @xmath7    we can best address the strength of the interaction by describing the magnitude of the contact interaction @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> for a narrow sigma this would have the value @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> there is some uncertainty in the appropriate value of @xmath26 , because the preferred fit magnitudes depend somewhat on the calculational scheme used . </S>",
    "<S> however , phenomenological studies of the nuclei tend to require @xmath27  mev@xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the contact interaction is given by the strength of the momentum space potential of eq . </S>",
    "<S> 1 evaluated at @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this is just integral under the integrand shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the result depend most sensitively on the parameter @xmath30 , which is not perfectly known . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological extraction of @xmath30 from @xmath31 data has a large error bar , @xmath32  gev@xmath28   @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , when using an omnes representation , it is likely that this constraint is on the product @xmath33 , in which case the value would be @xmath34  gev@xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the other parameter choices used were @xmath35  gev@xmath28 and @xmath36  gev@xmath28 , although these have only a small impact on the results . ) </S>",
    "<S> the result for @xmath26 as a function of @xmath30 is shown in fig 4 . </S>",
    "<S> there is good agreement for the required range of magnitudes of @xmath26 for the allowed values of @xmath30@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the use of a form factor does make a difference . with the form factor described above </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath26 is 40% smaller than without it for a given value of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> however at present understanding this difference may be accounted for by adjusting the value of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> these uncertainties in the appropriate values of @xmath30 and @xmath26 keep us from using the magnitude as a precise test of the method .     </S>",
    "<S> + @xmath23 +    @xmath7    in an effective field theory treatment , one keeps pion exchange as an explicit degree of freedom while treating the shorter range interactions as contact terms . </S>",
    "<S> in such a treatment , we should treat the box and crossed box diagrams of fig 1 dynamically , and they should therefore not be included into the contact interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason i did not include these diagrams in the calculation of the integrand @xmath37 whose integral gives the strength of the contact interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be admitted that the different approximations schemes that are used to calculate nuclear properties treat the iteration of the one - pion exchange interaction in quite different ways . </S>",
    "<S> use of time - dependent perturbation theory , field theoretic methods , mean - field methods , bethe - salpeter approximations , etc all capture different amounts of the box and crossed box diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the serious ambiguity of what is meant by a potential in field theory@xcite , and this likely accounts for the range of fit values of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that for the scalar central potential the iteration of the one pion interaction is a numerically small compared to the irreducible two pion / sigma contribution , for example see @xcite and fig 3.15 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully this ambiguity will be cleared up as effective field theory techniques are extended to heavier nuclei@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> chiral perturbation theory plus the omnes function give a quite simple description of the scalar central potential , with a result very similar to the exchange of a fictitious sigma particle . </S>",
    "<S> however fortunately there is no need in such a description to postulate such a scalar particle . </S>",
    "<S> this description appears to be robust , being qualitatively unchanged by the addition of higher order interactions . </S>",
    "<S> besides elucidating a long standing puzzle , these results are useful because we have a reasonably solid control over all the ingredients , the chiral amplitudes and the @xmath12 phase shifts . </S>",
    "<S> questions such as the quark mass dependence of nuclear bending may now be addressed in a reasonable fashion@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the connection of the nuclear interaction to qcd becomes more under control . </S>"
