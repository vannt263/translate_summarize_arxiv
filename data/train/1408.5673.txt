    "interest rate is a rate charged for the use of the money . as an  example",
    "we show the evolution of several interest rates on the market in figure [ fig : intro ] above .",
    "figure [ fig : intro ] below displays the interest rates with different maturities ( so called term structures ) at a given day .",
    "short rate models are based on specifying the evolution of the instantaneous interest rates ( also called short rate ) in terms of a stochastic differential equation .",
    "the remaining interest rates are then determined by the bond prices . after specifying the so called market price of risk ,",
    "the price of a bond is a solution to the partial differential equation ( pde ) .",
    "alternatively , the short rate evolution can be given in so called risk neutral measure .",
    "in particular , if the short rate evolves in the risk neutral measure according to the stochastic differential equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a wiener process , then the price @xmath4 of the zero - coupon bond at time @xmath5 when the current level of the short rate is @xmath6 , is a solution to the pde @xmath7 the pde ( [ eq : pde1 ] ) holds for all @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the maturity of the bond .",
    "morover , since the bond pays its principal value at maturity , which can be normalized to be 1 , the function @xmath11 moreover satisfies the terminal condition @xmath12 for all @xmath8 .",
    "the interest rates @xmath13 is then given by the formula @xmath14 see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite for more details on interest rates modelling .",
    "solution to the bond pricing pde ( [ eq : pde1 ] ) is known only i special cases , such as vasicek model @xcite or cox - ingersoll - ross ( cir ) model @xcite . sometimes , there is a closed form solution known but it is complicated , for example the bond price in dothan model @xcite involves special functions and two - dimensional integration . in general ,",
    "however , there no closed form solution avalible . therefore , the bond prices are computed using monte carlo simulations , numerically solving the pde ( [ eq : pde1 ] ) or by looking for analytical approximative formulae .",
    "we follow the last approach in this paper .    in papers",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the chan - karolyi - longstaff - sanders ( ckls ) model @xcite @xmath15 and analytical approximate formulae for bond prices were considered .",
    "the time independence of the coefficients of the model enables us to write the bond price in terms of the time to maturity @xmath16 .",
    "the common feature of these approximations is that their order of accuracy can be expressed in the form @xmath17 as @xmath18 , where @xmath11 is the exact bond price and @xmath19 is the proposed approximation .",
    "the relation ( [ eq - order ] ) asserts that the taylor series of @xmath20 and @xmath21 coincide up to the certain order .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it has been shown that for the formula from @xcite the relation ( [ eq - order ] ) holds with @xmath22 and an improvement leading to @xmath23 has been derived . in @xcite a simple formula with @xmath24 has been proposed .",
    "these results suggest that the taylor expansion ( either of the price itself and its logarithm ) could be a good approximation too .",
    "a numerical illustration is presented in table [ tab : motivation - bond ] and table [ tab : motivation - rates ] .",
    ".zero coupon bond prices in the cir model with parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( taken from @xcite ) , @xmath28 : exact solution , approximation from @xcite and taylor expansions of the exact solution around @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we considered the taylor expansion for bond prices and their logarithms in a general one factor model with time independent parameters .",
    "the expansion is considered with respect to time to maturity @xmath1 around @xmath0 .",
    "the coefficients of the taylor expansions can be computed recursively and expressed in a closed form .",
    "since the prices are expanded into series around @xmath0 , the most precise resuts are expected to be obtained ofr small @xmath1 .",
    "however , numerical examples dealing with cox - ingersoll - ross and dothan models show that we are able to obtain very precise approximations also for higher values of @xmath1 .",
