    "the rx qubit is designed to operate at the point in parameter space where the fixed electric fields yield qubit a with no low - frequency response to additional fields ( no dc dipole ) , but with a narrow - band response to an applied ac field at the qubit frequency ( an ac dipole ) . in the context of our model , variations of @xmath44 ( with @xmath45",
    "the position of dot @xmath14 along the inter - dot axis ) are equivalent to looking at the electric dipole response of the qubit system ( fig .",
    "[ f:2q]a ) .",
    "our ideal operation point  protected against low - frequency noise by the energy gap @xmath46  occurs when the energy quantization axis in the @xmath47 subspace for a fixed @xmath48 is perpendicular to the perturbation of the system due to a small variation @xmath49 . for small tunneling asymmetry @xmath50 , we have @xmath51",
    ". variations of @xmath8 around @xmath48 lead to variations of a perturbation orthogonal to the quantization axis , providing a direct dipole moment between ground and excited states as indicated by the virtual process in fig .",
    "we write the hamiltonian using pauli matrices such that its eigenenergies are quadratic in @xmath52 : h_rx = _ z + f _ x with @xmath53 the energy difference between the two energy eigenstates and @xmath54 an effective matrix element coupling @xmath52 to the qubit degree of freedom .",
    "rabi nutation becomes accessible if one drives @xmath8 sinusoidally , i.e. , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an adjustable phase and @xmath57 varies slowly compared to the gap @xmath58 .",
    "near resonance ( small @xmath59 ) , we can work in a rotating frame and rotating wave approximation , and have a quantum bit nutation with rabi frequency ( ) ^2  .subsequent rabi nutations , with differing @xmath56 , correspond to rotations about various axes along the equator of the bloch sphere defined in @xmath60 .",
    "the key feature of the rx qubit is a reduction in response to low - frequency noise , due to the gap @xmath58 .",
    "however , a secondary benefit arises from purely practical concerns : the necessary bandwidth for performing gates via modulated microwaves is on the order of @xmath61 around the center frequency @xmath58 .",
    "this allows for filtering of classical noise in other frequencies to a high order .",
    "however , the adiabatic gate control necessary in the current scheme for preparation and measurement requires a second bandpass for control at a frequency much lower than @xmath58 . alternatively ,",
    "as we show below , preparation and readout can be accomplished using circuit qed  @xcite coupling of the qubit levels to a microwave cavity , in direct analogy to the transmon superconducting qubit  @xcite .",
    "in addition , this so - called ` sweet spot ' provides a several mechanisms for coupling rx qubits . in particular , two rx qubits in proximity will have a multipole - multipole interaction due to the coupling of the dipole to the electric field . at large distances @xmath62 between two rx qubits with relative angle @xmath63 and dipole moments @xmath64 , they interact via dipole - dipole terms ( fig .",

    "this enables direct ` swap'-type gates between the two qubits .",
    "extensions of corpse pulse sequences allows for such gates to be integrated with homogeneous echo sequences  @xcite , providing potential high - fidelity operation even for slow gates as implicit in the overall @xmath68 performance . for qubits with resonance frequencies differing by @xmath69 , driving one qubit with a rabi frequency @xmath70 creates , in the double rotating frame , a resonant interaction , in direct analogy to hartman - hahn double resonance .",

    ", width=307 ]    while a dipolar approximation yields a straightforward understanding of the coupling mechanism , the more general result will require inclusion of higher order terms , as @xmath81 .",
    "fortunately , a convenient approximation remains by expanding the interaction between the two rx qubits via their capacitive interaction , where we can include an explicit coupling between adjacent rx qubits of the form @xmath82 ( fig .  [ f:2q]c ) .",
    "this is a direct extension of efforts to couple double quantum dots capacitively  @xcite . in the transformed frame , n_a,1(3 ) -1 written in the logical basis with @xmath83 , we have v_mm = u_ab ( _ z^(a )",
    "_ z^(b ) + 3 _ x^(a ) _ x^(a ) ) with non - secular terms such as @xmath84 removed by symmetry .",
    "going beyond the dipole expansion has added a @xmath85 coupling term , which can enable gates even when the qubits are at different resonant frequencies , as is commonly dealt with in nmr  @xcite .    finally , an additional mechanism for two - qubit gates is the direct coupling of a rx qubit to a high quality factor superconducting cavity ( fig .",
    "[ f:2q]d ) , as has recently been achieved for double quantum dots  @xcite , where @xmath86 was demonstrated .",
    "we can estimate the vacuum rabi coupling of a dipole of size @xmath87 ( @xmath88 nm is the size of the triple dot system ) to a transmission - line circuit qed cavity with transverse mode area @xmath89 as @xmath90 with @xmath91 the fine structure constant .",
    "the corresponding coupling of the rx qubit is @xmath92 . for @xmath93",

    "thus for @xmath95 and for systems with high cavity @xmath96 and long qubit @xmath97s",
    "@xcite , the strong coupling regime becomes accessible .",
    "one potential complication is the addition of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "however , if we neglect spin - flip terms in the spin - orbit coupling due to the large applied external field , the resulting spin - conserving terms correspond only to a redefinition of the singlet states . specifically , including as an addition to tunneling terms @xmath98 and similarly for @xmath99 , the qubit subspace is defined by the two non - orthogonal basis vectors @xmath100 .",
    "thus spin - conserving spin - orbit serves only to renormalize the effective tunneling coefficients .    while spin - orbit coupling is mostly accounted for , nuclear spins and other magnetic gradient fields change can lead to additional noise  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for zeeman terms @xmath101 in each dot aligned with the external homogeneous field ( due to nuclear gradients or to other gradients ) , we have in the @xmath102 basis v_nuc = (    ccc -b_q & b_d & b_d + b_d & b_q & - b_q + b_d & - b_q & 0    ) with @xmath103 and @xmath104 the quadrupolar and dipolar contributions from the gradient .",
    "we remark that the nuclear effects , both on the qubit frequency @xmath58 and on the coupling between the two qubit states and leakage state may be suppressed for triple dot devices with a non - trivial tunneling between dots 1 and 3 , as recognized in molecular magnet studies  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , while gradient terms change the hamiltonian , they may suppressed by two different effects .",
    "first , the coupling between qubit states ( and to the leakage space ) is suppressed by the large energy scale @xmath58 set by exchange couplings . in essence ,",
    "exchange averages over nuclear gradients , leading only to higher order effects from all terms except the diagonal terms in the hamiltonian ( which go as @xmath105 for the symmetric regime ) .",
    "second , the @xmath105 terms are slowly varying with root - mean - square expectation of @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the average size of the nuclear field in a single quantum dot . as such ,",
    "they may be suppressed by use of standard spin - echo due to their low - frequency character .",
    "phonons provide an intrinsic source of electric field fluctuations that couple to the electric dipole moment of the qubit via the electron - phonon interaction , causing relaxation @xcite .",
    "this interaction has the form @xcite @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the factor which depends on electronic degrees of freedom , and the constants are : mass density @xmath110 , volume @xmath111 , phonon speeds @xmath112 , deformation potential @xmath113 for the longitudinal @xmath114 mode , and piezoelectric constant @xmath115 . the operator @xmath116 creates a phonon with wavevector @xmath117 , energy @xmath118 and polarization @xmath119 , and @xmath120 is the kronecker delta function .    the rate @xmath121 of qubit relaxation due to @xmath122 is given by fermi s golden rule as@xmath123 @xmath124 . here , @xmath125 is the phonon density of states evaluated at the exchange gap @xmath58 between the states @xmath126 and @xmath127 that determines the energy of the emitted phonon .",
    "the matrix element @xmath128 is evaluated by defining gaussian wavefunctions @xmath129 which are shifted along the dot axis by @xmath130 @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively , and by changing to the qubit basis via the same schrieffer - wolff and diagonalization transformations used to determine @xmath135 .",
    "a simple model suggests @xmath136 , given the piezoelectric coupling domination at low frequencies and the dipole moment of the qubit , which is consistent with the more detailed prediction ( fig .",
    "[ f:2q]e ) fit with @xmath137 ghz .",
    "the simple and detailed models agree over the range @xmath138 ghz and @xmath139 .",
    "we now seek optimal parameters for performance .",
    "we assume @xmath83 ( setting @xmath140 ) and use @xmath141 and @xmath142 to rewrite all terms with @xmath143 or @xmath144 .",
    "nuclear spin - induced @xmath145 is due to fluctuations in @xmath105",
    ". variations in @xmath8 are limited the width of our narrowband filter ; thus @xmath146 .",
    "a single qubit @xmath147 rotation has an estimated infidelity @xmath148 . for long @xmath149 times , this yields @xmath150 , though for sufficiently large @xmath58 , @xmath151 becomes important .",
    "however , two - qubit gates are more limited by @xmath151 than by @xmath145 , as we can apply refocusing pulses during the two - qubit gate . in that case",
    ", we seek to balance the gate time against @xmath151 .",
    "as @xmath151 may be limited by phonon relaxation at appreciable values of @xmath58 , we consider the @xmath149 limited scenario , with an estimate of the infidelity for an entangling gate @xmath152 . also requiring @xmath153 for single - qubit gates ,",

    "consistent with current gaas devices  @xcite , the optimal @xmath157 ghz and @xmath158 .",
    "some improvement can occur by reduction of the nuclear field , improvement in capacitive coupling , or phonon band - gap engineering .",
    "however , the most dramatic increase of fidelity occurs in the presence of a resonant superconducting cavity .",
    "then the product of cavity coupling and relaxation , @xmath159 , increases with smaller @xmath141 , leading to gates that may be limited by @xmath151 processes .",
