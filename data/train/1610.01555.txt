    "suppose first that the subproblem @xmath143 is exact and not poised , or overdetermined .",
    "then , in view of propositions [ 0p1 ] , i ) , and [ 0p2 ] , ii ) , there is a node @xmath144 which does not have a fundamental function .",
    "then , evidently the same node @xmath145 does not have a fundamental function for the whole node set @xmath146 too .",
    "hence , in view of proposition [ 0p1 ] , i ) , we get that the problem @xmath139 is not poised .",
    "now consider the case when the subproblem @xmath143 is poised .",
    "let us assume that the both reduced problems in are poised .",
    "then let us prove that the problem @xmath139 is poised , too .",
    "notice first that the problem @xmath139 is exact .",
    "thus , by following proposition [ 0p1 ] , ii ) , assume that @xmath147 now , since the subproblem @xmath143 is poised , we conclude that @xmath15 vanishes on the triangles @xmath148 therefore @xmath15 vanishes at the right side of the triangle @xmath149 and at the left side of the triangle @xmath150 thus we have that @xmath151 and @xmath152 finally , since the problems in are poised , we obtain that @xmath15 vanishes on the triangles @xmath153 and @xmath154 hence @xmath15 vanishes on all triangles of @xmath56    next let us assume that the problem @xmath139 is poised and prove that the both reduced problems in are poised , too .",

    "therefore one of the subproblems , say the first problem in , is underdetermined , and another is overdetermined .",

    "now notice that in the triangles from @xmath290 till @xmath291 the number of nodes equals to @xmath292 i.e. , the number of triangles here .",
    "this means that there is another triangle in the first block , following @xmath291 containing two nodes , such that at least one node is not lying in the right side of the triangle .",
    "then consider the first such triangle @xmath293 if one of the two nodes here is in the right side of the triangle then the next triangle @xmath294 also contains two nodes , because otherwise it would be thrown away before .",
    "now notice that in the triangles from @xmath290 till @xmath295 the number of nodes does not exceeds @xmath296 i.e. , the number of triangles here plus @xmath283 this means that there is another triangle in this series , denoted by @xmath297 following @xmath295 containing two nodes , which do not lie in its right side",
    ". this will be the first triangle of the desired subproblem .",
    "now notice that in the triangles from @xmath290 till @xmath297 the number of nodes equals to @xmath298 i.e. , the number of triangles here plus @xmath283 this means that there is another triangle in the first block , following @xmath297 containing two nodes .",
    "denote by @xmath299 the first such triangle .",
    "this will be the last triangle of the desired subproblem .",
    "first notice that each triangle between @xmath300 and @xmath301 if there is a such , contains just one node , which , as was mentioned earlier , can not be located in its left or right side .",
    "therefore no node in @xmath301 belongs to the left side of the triangle , since otherwise @xmath302 would contain a node in its right side .",
    "note also that in this case @xmath303 does not coincide with @xmath297 since the latter has no node in its right side .",
    "thus the subproblem @xmath304 is of type `` 2 + 2 '' , or `` @xmath184 '' with @xmath305    _ step 2 . _ next , by using line - transformations , we either reduce this subproblem to a basic subproblem or determine that the problem @xmath139 is not poised .",
    "first suppose that the subproblem @xmath304 is of type `` @xmath179 '' .",
    "if it is not basic then the line through the two nodes in a triangle intersects its interior side . then by replacing these two nodes with their intersection pair we will have in the other triangle one more node , i.e. , three nodes .",
    "this case was considered in the beginning of the proof .",
    "finally , suppose that the subproblem @xmath304 is of type `` @xmath184 , '' with @xmath305 now , if this subproblem is not basic then in the same way as in the previous case we may reduce it by line transformation to a problem of the same type , where the number of @xmath182s equals to @xmath306 thus we may complete readily the proof by using induction on @xmath307 where the first step of induction corresponds to the case @xmath204 considered already .",
    "consider a problem @xmath308 where the strip consists of @xmath12 triangles . denote the number of nodes from @xmath78 in the triangles @xmath309 by @xmath310 @xmath311 the following proposition gives some necessary conditions of poisedness .",
    "[ nc ] given a poised problem @xmath308 where the strip consists of @xmath12 triangles .",
    "then for each @xmath312 and @xmath313 we have that @xmath314 moreover , in the cases @xmath141 and @xmath142 we have stricter inequalities : @xmath315    let us prove first the right inequality in : @xmath316 indeed , suppose conversely that @xmath317 then the subproblem @xmath318 is overdetermined",
    ". therefore the problem @xmath308 in view of theorem [ main ] , is not poised , which is a contradiction .                [ 00 ] given an exact problem @xmath308 where the strip consists of @xmath12 triangles .",
    "suppose that some two successive triangles @xmath326 and @xmath291 where @xmath327 do not contain nodes . then the problem @xmath139 is poised if and only if the both following two reduced problems @xmath328 are exact and poised .",
    "let us assume that the both reduced problems in are poised .",
    "notice that then the problem @xmath139 is exact .",
    "now let us prove , by following proposition [ 0p1 ] , ii ) , that the problem @xmath139 is poised , too .",
    "thus , assume that @xmath147 from here we get that @xmath329 and @xmath330 since the two subproblems in are poised , we conclude that @xmath15 vanishes on the triangles @xmath153 and @xmath331 therefore @xmath15 vanishes also at the left side of the triangle @xmath332 and at the right side of the triangle @xmath333 in particular @xmath15 vanishes at all the vertices of triangles @xmath332 and @xmath333 thus it vanishes on these two triangles too .",
    "hence @xmath334      let us show first that the both reduced problems in are exact .",
    "there are @xmath155 and @xmath335 triangles in the reduced problems , respectively .",
    "therefore for exactness we need @xmath157 and @xmath336 nodes , respectively , altogether @xmath79 nodes .",
    "now , assume by way of contradiction that a subproblem in is not exact .",
    "then a subproblem is overdetermined and the other is underdetermined .",
    "therefore , by theorem [ main ] , i ) , the problem is not poised , which is a contradiction .    finally , let us show that both the reduced problems in are poised",
    ". assume by way of contradiction that one of them is not poised .",
