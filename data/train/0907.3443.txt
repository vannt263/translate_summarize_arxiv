    "the angular rate at which bar and spiral structures rotate , the pattern speed , is a parameter appreciated for its capacity to reveal information about the appearance , properties and evolution of galaxy disks . since the pattern speed determines the rate at which gas and stars encounter these structures , it provides a description of their influence on star formation , the processing of the interstellar medium and the distribution of metals ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , for example , as well as the redistribution of mass in the disk . bar torques depend on the pattern speed , and therefore gas inflow rates @xcite do , as well . in early - type barred galaxies , pattern speeds",
    "have also been used to investigate the central dark matter ( dm ) content in these systems ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "+ the pattern speed moreover supplies a fundamental characterization with which to investigate the origin and evolution of large - scale structures , one of the prime unresolved issues in the dynamics and evolution of galaxy disks .",
    "with knowledge of bar and spiral or the radial variation of spiral pattern speeds in a given galaxy it is possible to determine whether spiral structure is steady or winding , the domain and number of patterns that can be sustained in a disk , and the relation between bar and spiral pattern speeds .",
    "direct pattern speed measurements , however , have been elusive . + although grand - design spirals have been observationally linked to the presence of bars or companions @xcite , it remains unclear whether spirals are long - lived density waves persisting over many revolutions ( i.e. @xcite ; @xcite ) , or rapidly - evolving , transient features , as found in several simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ it is also uncertain how waves can exist over large fractions of a disk radius , as observed . since the resonances ( inner and outer lindblad ; ilr and olr ) between which waves are expected to propagate in general do not span a large range in radius , waves of different speeds and structure may occupy distinct radial zones @xcite . in barred galaxies , the apparent alignment between bar and spiral ( as in m83 , where the two - armed spiral emanates from the bar ends ) , initially taken as evidence for a common pattern speed , does not occur in general @xcite . furthermore , where the bar ends near its corotation resonance ( cr ) ( e.g. as found in early - types ; @xcite ) , a spiral generated with the same speed would lie mostly outside the cr ( i.e. with dust lanes along the convex side of the arms ) , which is also uncommon .",
    "+ in the theory of `` mode coupling '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , multiple patterns in different radial zones are linked , such that the resulting wave structure can extend over a larger radial range than is possible for a single pattern . in this scenario ,",
    "the cr of an inner pattern overlaps with the ilr of an outer pattern , and at this overlap energy and angular momentum are efficiently transferred outward in the disk .",
    "this was first demonstrated between simulated bars and spirals by @xcite and later by @xcite , who find , in addition , that other resonance overlaps , such as the coincidence of the spiral s inner 4:1 resonance with the bar cr , are also effective .",
    "given that the radial extent of resonant orbits can be quite large , these overlappings can be spatially broad , and frequency diagrams can therein be suitably revealing .",
    "however , not all such resonance overlaps are accompanied by signs of true mode - coupling ( i.e. boosted beat modes detectable in simulation power spectra at the overlap ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ spiral - spiral mode coupling may also occur , typified , perhaps , by the transition commonly observed between a strong two - armed spiral and more complex structure at some radius . in their simulations , @xcite find evidence for spiral structure in the absence of a bar , spiral - spiral mode coupling , and multiple pattern speeds without mode coupling .",
    "+ to observationally investigate these possibilities , we have undertaken a project to measure spiral pattern speeds and their radial variation using the radial tremaine - weinberg method developed by @xcite , subsequently tested on simulations @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) , and recently applied to a real spiral in the grand - design galaxy m51 ( @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) . like its traditional counterpart  the tw method for measuring a single , constant pattern speed @xcite  the twr calculation yields measurements of pattern speeds using observationally accessible quantities based on a requirement of continuity . the method is direct , and so overcomes several of the obstacles in reliably estimating pattern speeds with other , indirect methods ( e.g. resonance identification or modeling ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ moreover , the twr method provides a resolution for those applications of the tw method where pattern speed estimates show a clear , systematic departure from a single value ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . particularly in disks with multiple or extended structures ,",
    "this behavior implies that the pattern speed is not constant either because it varies temporally or spatially . by allowing the pattern speed to vary in the radial direction",
    ", the twr method explicitly allows for the possibility that a galaxy may contain a number of distinct features at different radii , such as bars and spiral arms , each with their own pattern speeds .",
    "it also makes possible the detection of spiral winding and hence the estimation of the lifetime of a galaxy s current pattern . + our aim with this paper",
    "is to expand to a larger sample of galaxies the twr analysis recently applied to the grand - design spiral galaxy m51 ( paper ii ) . here , as there , we apply the method according to the prescription outlined in paper i. the calculation employs regularization , which smooths otherwise intrinsically noisy solutions through the use of a prior models of the radial dependence of the pattern speed , and affords straightforward tests for bar - spiral and spiral - spiral relations , and spiral winding .",
    "+ also as in paper ii , for use as a kinematic tracer we consider observations of the ism , which have become the standard choice of spiral tracer for meeting the continuity requirement of the method .",
    "the application of the tw and twr methods to co and hi observations of spiral galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) avoids significant problems with the stellar component in these systems , namely the faintness of the old stellar disk , and the effects of star formation and obscuration by dust in spiral arms by which the application of the continuity equation is invalidated .",
    "+ furthermore , where the ism is dominated by either the molecular ( traced by co ) or atomic gas phases , conversion among phases can be assumed to occur at low levels on orbital timescales such that , together with the low true efficiency of star formation in spirals , the dominant component arguably obeys continuity ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , as an improvement on previous ism - based tw spiral studies , here we analyze both molecular gas observations from the bima song ( @xcite ; maps include zero - spacing flux information ) and archival 21-cm emission data tracing the atomic hydrogen phase .",
    "( the flux information at the largest scales in all of the hi cubes considered here is comparable to that achieved with single - dish observations ; see references in @xmath0[sec : samp5457]-[sec : samp3344 ] ) .",
    "our consideration of both co and the more extended hi here serves two main purposes . in galaxies that are",
    "not molecule - dominated over the extent of the detectable co emission , the hi supplements h@xmath1 to establish a total particle , continuity - obeying tracer . the radial range of detectable pattern speeds is also increased in this way .",
    "+ part of our treatment , in this case , entails an investigation ( where possible ) into the sensitivity of twr solutions to the co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor @xmath2 adopted in combining the data , which has been suggested to vary linearly with metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) . following @xcite and paper ii",
    ", we consider the effect of variation in @xmath2 with radius ( but not the possibility , for example , of arm - interarm variations ) .",
    "we also take into consideration distortions or warps observable in the outer hi disks in our sample ( described in @xmath0[sec : sample]-[sec : samp3344 ] ) , which violate of one of the main tw assumptions ( namely , that the disk is flat ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ based on the a priori models described in @xmath3[sec : results ] , the best - fit pattern speed solutions calculated for each galaxy are presented in @xmath0 [ sec : results5457]-[sec : results3344 ] . there ,",
    "the resonances associated with each , which we identify through comparison with angular rotation curves , serve as a main informant of our results ; our findings are motivated by , and compared with , the large body of work linking resonances to the dynamics and morphology of disks .",
    "we also discuss the limitations and sensitivities of the twr calculation ( described in paper i ) as applied to each galaxy and summarize our results in @xmath34 .",
    "in the following subsections we describe the four spiral galaxies analyzed in this paper , m101 , ic 342 , ngc 3938 , and ngc 3344 .",
    "this small sample is not meant to be representative of variations in spiral structure with galaxy classification type , or to embody all possible theories of spiral structure .",
    "these nearby galaxies were selected simply for their clear spiral structure and moderate inclination , as well as for the availability of observations ( specifically , both co and hi in three of the four cases ) of sufficient sensitivity and resolution to allow structure to be resolved and the radial variation of @xmath4 to be investigated ; see paper i. + with this sample we explore three scenarios for applying the twr method to observations of the ism .",
    "we first consider both the molecular and atomic components of the ism in m101 , which is molecule - dominated over the detectable extent of the co emission , and investigate whether there exists a relation between the speeds of the multiple structures apparent throughout the disk .",
    "we then apply the method to two galaxies ( ic 342 and ngc 3938 ) where the isms are dominated by neither the atomic or molecular gas phases in the central few kpc ; in this case , considering the total column density is necessary for meeting the continuity requirement of the method .",
    "lastly , for ngc 3344 , where the ism is dominated by the atomic phase over the majority of the disk area ( see @xmath3[sec : samp3344 ] ) , we analyze hi data alone , and with our twr solution predict a pattern speed for the small bar .",
    "+ in three of the four cases , a warp - like distortion is evident in the hi distribution and kinematics , often with little further evidence of a strong spiral pattern .",
    "a warp in the outer disk , characterized by position and/or inclination angles that differ from those values in the disk interior , violates the tw assumption that the disk is flat @xcite . in implementing the regularized twr method",
    "we therefore adopt the procedure advocated in paper i ( see the beginning of @xmath3 [ sec : results ] ) , which accommodates for the presence of information about the warp in the twr quadrature by excluding it from regularized solutions .",
    "+ zeroth and first moment maps for each galaxy are shown in figures [ fig - mom0 ] and [ fig - mom1 ] . for m101 ,",
    "ic 342 and ngc 3938 , these maps were generated from the combined co and hi cubes , which were regridded to a uniform channel width and co - added in units of particles @xmath5 .",
    "prior to combination , the co cubes were smoothed to the resolution of the hi and co intensities converted to molecular column densities assuming a constant co - to-@xmath6 conversion factor @xmath2=2.0@xmath710@xmath8@xmath9k km s@xmath10^{-1}$ ] , the galactic mean value ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( subsequent variations in the @xmath2-factor are considered when applicable . ) + tilted ring fits to the velocity field of the four galaxies were performed using the gipsy @xcite task rotcur in order to derive the kinematic parameters used in the twr calculation . for these fits , the systemic velocity is initially fixed to the value given in the literature , while the kinematic center , position angle ( pa ) , and inclination are allowed to vary .",
    "( the value and the errors on @xmath11 were subsequently determined by fitting with all other best - fit parameters held fixed . )",
    "the values we find are in good agreement with those nominally adopted for each galaxy and are listed in table [ tab - params ] .",
    "+ for the purposes of identifying resonances ( corotation , inner and outer lindblad ) , we also derived the circular velocity in each ring with the best - fit kinematic parameters held fixed . in each galaxy these velocities are modeled in the unwarped portion of the disk with least - squares fits to the standard three - parameter approximation ( i.e. @xcite ) @xmath12 as shown in figure [ fig - vfits ] .",
    "the errors bars on each measured velocity there reflect the average deviation from this value on either the approaching or receding side , which together we find better represent the uncertainty in the rotation curve than do the formal errors returned by rotcur . with the fitted velocities ,",
    "we then generate a set of smooth curves for @xmath13 , @xmath13@xmath14@xmath15/2 , and @xmath13@xmath14@xmath15/4 ; these curves are intended to reduce the impact of non - axisymmetric motions ( e.g. spiral streaming ) on our resonance identifications and were invoked without regard to specific mass component characterization .",

    "the bar is a clear candidate - driver of the spiral structure that appears to emanate from the bar region . at the outer radii , tidal interaction with companion galaxies ( e.g. ngc 5474 and ngc 5477 ; @xcite , @xcite )",
    "is thought to be responsible for the lop - sidedness and distortion in the hi distribution , and may also be the source of the spiral @xcite .",
    "the high resolution ( @xmath247  ) of the total h@xmath1+hi maps constructed from the bima song co data and things hi data ( with robust weighting scheme ; @xcite ) allows us to apply the twr method with exceptional leverage on the radial dependence of the pattern speed throughout the disk .",

    "so , while a constant offset should have no implications for twr solutions , we also consider the effect of variation in @xmath2 outward from the center .      for this seyfert sabcd galaxy ( d=2.0 mpc ; @xcite )",
    ", we base our analysis on the bima song co data cube and the 38  vla hi observations first published by @xcite . as in m101 , the co fills the central hole in hi distribution , but here the atomic gas makes a significant contribution to the total gas density before the edge of the co emission .",
    "a thorough discussion of the hi - co overlap and the features ( a bar , a two - armed spiral , and a four - armed spiral ) in the two gaseous components can be found in the study of @xcite .",
    "ngc 3938 ( d=11.3 mpc ; @xcite ) is a nearly face - on , late type ( sac ) galaxy exhibiting a central two - armed spiral that branches into multi - armed structure in the optical .",
    "the two strong spiral arms are evident in the molecular gas , which reaches a surface density comparable to that of the hi inside the edge of the co emission .",
    "but where the stellar disk exhibits flocculent , but clear , spiral structure ( with as many as six arms ; @xcite ) , the hi disk is characterized by less well - organized , irregular structure .",
    "the combination of archival wsrt hi data with bima song co observations establishes a total h@xmath1+hi kinematic tracer at roughly 20  resolution that extends to just beyond the optical extent of this galaxy @xcite .",
    "the application of the model - independent twr method to this hi - dominated , isolated sabbc galaxy ( d=7.4 mpc ; @xcite ) should , in principle , clearly establish the relation of the ring - like morphological features at @xmath25=1 kpc and @xmath25=7 kpc , identified by @xcite in optical images , to the large - scale patterns present in the disk ( and their resonances ) .",
    "the outer ring , in particular , although thought unlikely to be related to the small bar ( not observed in the gas ) with @xmath28@xmath240.7 kpc @xcite , has not been otherwise conclusively related to the spiral . in search , as well , of spiral winding and multiple spiral modes , here we analyze 20  resolution archival wsrt hi data where the dominant two - armed spiral and the outer ring are clear , in addition to the outer lopsided region exhibiting a twist in the isovels @xcite .",
    "the zone of the bar and the inner ring , which falls within the central 26  where there is little 21-cm emission , corresponds to less than two resolution elements .",
    "so although the ring is resolved in co @xcite , and the peak h@xmath1 column density @xcite there exceeds the hi , we do not consider the contribution of the molecular gas here .",
    "we apply the regularized twr method as in paper i. for each galaxy we consider several smoothed , testable models for @xmath29 .",
    "these models vary as polynomials ( order @xmath30@xmath312 ) designated into at most three distinct radial zones .",
    "where a priori evidence suggests that there is little information from a strong pattern beyond a certain radius , or that the tw assumptions are otherwise violated by the presence of a warp , for example , our models also include the parameterization of a cut radius , @xmath32 , beyond which all bins are calculated without regularization ( i.e. the functional form is unconstrained ) .",
    "these models , with @xmath32 marking the end of the dominant structure , have been demonstrated to sufficiently separate the compromised zones in the disk from regions where information about patterns can be reliably extracted in the twr calculation ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "all transitions @xmath33 between distinct zones and all cut radii , where present , are treated as free parameters .",
    "+ for each model , the two numerical solutions for @xmath29 from either side of the galaxy ( y@xmath340 and y@xmath350 ; @xcite ) are averaged to construct a single , global model solution .",
    "each model solution is then judged based on a simple reduced @xmath36 statistic , with the best - fit solution corresponding to the @xmath37-minimum in the full parameter space . + as in paper ii , the random , measurement errors used in the regularized calculation , and with which we judge the best - fit solution , reflect uncertainty arising with the chosen flux cut - off in the first moment maps .",
    "the systematic errors on each measurement represent uncertainty in the pa , which is the dominant source of error in tw and twr estimates ( @xcite ; paper i ) , roughly 20% for @xmath38=3@xmath21 .",
    "but , here we report these as a dispersion on each measured value , rather than present individual solutions for each pa ; this is possible here since , unlike in m51 ( paper ii ) , we find no meaningful evidence that the form of the model associated with the best - fit solution for any of the galaxies in the current sample varies from pa to pa . also , unless otherwise noted , errors due to uncertainty in , e.g. , the inclination angle are generally smaller and are not reported ; these prove to be of little consequence to the accurate placement of radial bins defined in the quadrature ( as suggested in paper i ) . the additional change introduced in the measurements @xmath4 through a change in @xmath39",
    "is furthermore shared by @xmath13 and @xmath15 , and so our resonance identifications , in particular , should not be effected by error in the inclination to first order .",
    "a thorough account of our methodology can be found in paper i ( and references therein ) .",
    "we apply the twr calculation with radial bin width @xmath40=7=0.27 kpc ( d=7.4 mpc ) , the resolution of the combined cube . together with the position of the outermost slice on each side , @xmath41=30.4 @xmath42 kpc , this establishes the extent of integration along each slice , equipping solutions with 113 bins in total . the best - fit solution given a pa uncertainty @xmath143@xmath21",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig-5457twr ] . there",
    "shown , also , are the rotation and resonance curves derived as described in @xmath3[sec : sample ] .",
    "it should be noted that a @xmath2475 km s@xmath23 asymmetry in the rotational velocities from the approaching and receding sides exists at radii @xmath25@xmath4320 kpc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . + the outermost portion of the disk",
    "is effectively removed from the solution with the parameterization of a cut radius @xmath32=21.9@xmath140.43 kpc .",
    "this radius , identified at the minimum of the @xmath36 , is comparable to the location where the disk becomes visibly distorted .",
    "we find that the outer distortion / lop - sidedness clear in the surface density is well characterized by the predominance of an @xmath44=1 asymmetry beyond @xmath25@xmath2420 kpc in the fourier decomposition ( figure [ fig-5457fourier ] ) and also matched by a warp in the outer velocity field ; in addition to the rotation curve asymmetry , with our rotcur analysis we find that the pa and inclination of fitted rings beyond this radius vary significantly from the nominal values established in rings interior .",
    "( we note that this strong variation in the pa is found to start at a much larger radius than identified by @xcite . )",
    "inclination variation , in particular , is a violation of the tw / twr assumptions and so we argue that , by excluding the bins covering the outer disk from models for @xmath29 , the remaining , inner regularized bins are better equipped to reproduce the true pattern speed .",
    "( note that with this cut radius a possible @xmath44=1 mode describing the outer , lop - sided portion of the disk is ignored ) .",
    "+ in this case , the most conspicuous aspect of the solution is the pair of transitions at @xmath45=6.7@xmath140.25 kpc and @xmath46=13.8@xmath140.58 kpc ( marked in figure [ fig-5457zoom ] ) between three distinct pattern speeds , @xmath47=47@xmath1410 @xmath48 @xmath49=18@xmath141 @xmath48 and @xmath50=5@xmath143 @xmath48 out to @xmath32 . as discussed below , the innermost ,",
    "constant speed is nearly identical to the value @xmath4=48@xmath148 @xmath48 measured from the co maps , alone ( see @xmath3 [ sec : m101inner ] ) , while the second pattern speed is consistent with the value generally upheld in the literature ( @xmath4@xmath2419 @xmath48 for @xmath51@xmath2412 kpc , e.g. @xcite ; but see the end of this section ) .",
    "+ the quality of our measurement is especially clear in the precision with which the transitions between the three pattern speeds are determined . the transition @xmath45 , for example , shows less than 5% variation from pa to pa .",
    "this transition coincides with a marked decrease in @xmath44=2 power ( figure [ fig-5457fourier ] ) and occurs well past the edge of the co emission .",
    "we can therefore recognize that the inner speed describes the molecular bar and the two - armed spiral manifest in the co and weakly traceable in hi , which @xcite identify in the b - band out to @xmath25@xmath246 kpc ( estimated from their placement of the inner 4:1 circle in figure 1 , plate 14 , rather than with the discrepant value listed in table 3 there ) .",

    "this result , namely that structure in hi shares the same pattern speed as the structure interior ( exhibited solely by the molecular gas ) , admits a much stronger conclusion than can be drawn from the co , alone .",
    "our rotation and resonance curves indicate that the inner pattern ends near its olr ( @xmath25@xmath247 kpc ; or possibly the outer 4:1 resonance , within the errors ) which would not be evident from the application of the twr method to co data covering @xmath25@xmath313.5 kpc ( corresponding to the central zone in figures [ fig - mom0 ] and [ fig-5457zoom ] with column density @xmath2610@xmath52 @xmath5 ) .",
    "this finding is consistent with the theoretical expectation for the forbidden propagation of spiral density waves beyond this resonance , which observations corroborate ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ likewise , corotation for this speed occurs at @xmath25=3.5 kpc , very near the transition between molecular and atomic gas ( see figure [ fig-5457zoom ] ) . with its lack of clear structure and relatively low surface density ,",
    "this location in the gaseous disk seems consistent with an expected depopulation near cr owing to opposing torques ( whereby gas is driven inward between ilr and cr and outward between cr and olr ) .",
    "( this impression , however , may be subject to the sensitivity of the co map and the assumed @xmath2-factor . )",
    "+ interior to corotation , our determination of the disk angular rotation becomes less certain at a disadvantage to definitive resonance identifications .",
    "nevertheless , the two - armed spiral exhibited near @xmath25@xmath242 kpc by the molecular gas  and which appears almost ring - like  is arguably located near the inner 4:1 resonance kpc , or uhr , where gas can accumulate on its path inward from corotation to ilr @xcite .",
    "in addition , as will be discussed in more detail in @xmath3[sec : m101inner ] , the central concentration of gas in the form of the molecular bar ( with length @xmath241 kpc ) appears to lie well within the cr .",
    "this is also true of the stellar bar with @xmath53@xmath242 kpc @xcite , which suggests a scenario quite different from observational findings in favor almost exclusively of fast stellar bars ( with 1@xmath31@xmath51/a@xmath54@xmath311.4 ; @xcite ) , at least in early - type barred galaxies .",
    "instead , the stellar bar here seems reminiscent of the slow bars found in the simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ as for the pair of pattern speeds @xmath49 and @xmath50 outside @xmath45=6.7@xmath140.25 kpc , we can similarly use the curves in figure [ fig-5457twr ] to interpret their radial domains in terms of resonances .",
    "this is less straightforward , however , primarily because of our uncertainty in the poorly - fit rotation curve here , as well as the complex nature of the spiral structure visible in the hi surface density , which is characterized by power in several fourier modes ( see figure [ fig-5457fourier ] and optically , @xcite ) .",
    "notably , between @xmath25@xmath246 kpc and 13 kpc , the structure visible in hi appears four - armed ( see the top left panel in figure [ fig - mom0 ] and figure [ fig-5457fourier ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , near @xmath25=13 kpc a two - armed pattern starts to predominate again , as indicated in figure [ fig - mom0 ] and by figure [ fig-5457fourier ] where the power in the @xmath44=4 mode decreases relative to the @xmath44=2 mode .",
    "+ in this case , the transition @xmath45 in figure [ fig-5457twr ] would seem to associate the second speed @xmath49 with the four - armed spiral , here found to extend between the inner and outer 4:1 resonances at @xmath25@xmath246.8 kpc and @xmath25@xmath2414 kpc .",
    "( this is unchanged even with rotation curve models where the rise and fall in velocities between @xmath25=8 and 14 kpc in figure [ fig - vfits ] are more closely ( yet coarsely ) fit , although the end of @xmath49 more nearly approaches @xmath13-@xmath15/2 ) .",
    "the four - armed spiral in eso 566 - 24 likewise extends between its inner and outer 4:1 resonances @xcite .",
    "our finding is also roughly consistent with the identification made by @xcite ( @xcite ; in figure 1 , panel 14 there ) , namely that the zone dominated by the four - armed spiral is bounded by the inner 4:1 circle with @xmath25@xmath246 kpc and the cr circle with @xmath25@xmath2412 kpc .",
    "( we would argue , however , that the end of this zone occurs past the cr , which we find near @xmath25=10 kpc , depending on the rotation curve . )",

    "but since there is no dominant @xmath44=2 fourier component visible in the 21 cm emission or in the nir ( as observed by @xcite ) at these radii , it is unclear that this speed is associated with spiral structure , at all .",
    "a lack of spiral streaming motions in the atomic gas ( as also observed in the ionized component of the ism ; @xcite ) , would furthermore lead us to expect that , for any asymmetry in the surface density , a value much closer to the disk angular rotation frequency @xmath13 would be measured .",

    "this seems to suggest that the two - pattern speed solution @xmath70 ( with @xmath33 as marked in figure [ fig-3938zoom ] ) may be more realistic than @xmath65 ; the faster inner speed seems more compatible with structure at these radii than @xmath4@xmath247 @xmath48 since , even with uncertainty in @xmath13 at the inner radii and the near - constancy of @xmath13-@xmath15/2 at the outer radii , the low pattern speed s ilr would lie at @xmath25@xmath265 kpc .",
    "+ nonetheless , whether @xmath66 is a reliable measurement of the expected higher pattern speed is difficult to assert .",
    "the transition @xmath33 ( see figure [ fig-3938zoom ] ) lies just inside the edge of the co emission tracing a two - armed spiral ( clear in the unsmoothed bima song map ; @xcite ) , and so the measurement presumably reflects the speed of this pattern .",

    "also , while this pattern appears to lack an ilr , this is uncertain given that the angular velocities are the least well - determined at the inner radii .",
    "at this point there also does not seem to be a clear relation between the two pattern speeds ( e.g. overlapping cr and ilr ; @xcite ) , especially since resonances for the outer speed @xmath67 are difficult to establish , given the flatness of the resonance curves . + while our confidence in the twr measurement is tempered by the low inclination of the disk , the value of this analysis lies in the prospect of renewed perspective on the nature of the structure in this galaxy .",
    "although in no way definitive ( based on the twr method , alone ) , the lower measurement near @xmath13-@xmath15/2 ( either @xmath68 or @xmath67 ) , in particular , may be compatible with several pieces of evidence that point to the influence of the dm halo first contemplated by @xcite . +",
    "as investigated by @xcite or by @xcite , for example , the dm halo may be responsible for the appearance of structure in this isolated galaxy , which otherwise seems difficult to reconcile with the finding that the gas disk is everywhere subcritical to gravitational instability ( as remarked upon by @xcite , and aside from an alternative increase in instability possible through the coupling between multiple components in the system , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ specifically , where the toomre stability parameter in the gas is high , @xcite and @xcite suggest that the torque due to a triaxial halo ( predicted by cold dark matter simulations of hierarchical structure formation ; e.g. @xcite ) with slow figure rotation can drive structure in extended hi disks . material ( though not exclusive ) to this scenario , the disk of ngc 3938 exhibits intrinsic ellipticity : as similarly diagnosed in other eccentric nearby spirals by @xcite , the photometric and kinematic position angles of ngc 3938 are offset by nearly 50@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite measure an ellipticity @xmath72=0.11 in the j - band .",
    "so while the ellipticity may have arisen with an asymmetric accretion of matter , for example , it could also reflect an @xmath44=2 potential perturbation occasioned by triaxiality in the dm halo ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in this case , the twr solution may represent a measure of the rotation speed of such a halo , if the structure in the outer disk ( which , extends further in hi than in the optical ; @xcite ) arises in the manner considered by @xcite . currently , however , it is not clear that the structure in ngc 3938 is compatible with the strong two - armed patterns found in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "+ alternatively , the overall instability of the disk might be increased by a global mass asymmetry resulting from the @xmath44=1 perturbation to the halo potential considered by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , which is also a possible source of the ellipticity .",
    "this latter scenario seems to be compatible with other observable characteristics of this galaxy : like @xcite and @xcite , we find the hi disk to be slightly lop - sided toward the north , and this @xmath44=1 asymmetry appears in the hi velocity field , as well .",

    "+ in m101as well as in ic 342 and possibly ngc 3938we also find that the extensive spiral structure there is best described with more than a single pattern speed .",
    "furthermore , in both m101 and ic 342 we find evidence that the transition between two speeds coincides with resonance overlap . in the former",
    ", the transition between the two- and four - armed patterns occurs near the overlap of the inner s olr and the outer s inner 4:1 resonance . in the latter case , the inner pattern transitions to a four - armed spiral at an olr - ilr overlap .",
    "+ although the specific resonance overlaps identified in m101 and ic 342 have not been conclusively demonstrated as true instances of mode - coupling ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , together with the cr - inner 4:1 resonance overlap in m51 ( paper ii ) , this work suggests that there exist several possibilities dictated by resonance overlap by which extensive spiral structure can be sustained .",
    "our findings are qualitatively similar to the barred spiral simulations of @xcite , but we note that the spatially coincident existence of multiple modes with different pattern speeds , as often found there beyond the bar , is untested with the twr calculation here .",
    "even so , the outer four - armed spirals in both m101 and ic 342 are arguably excited at resonance by the patterns interior .",
    "+ on the other hand , in our sample we also find extensive spiral structure in the absence of clear resonance overlap .",
    "the speed characteristic of the outer , flocculent structure in ngc 3938 , for instance , does not seem to be clearly related to that of the inner , two - armed spiral , if the two speeds are distinct .",
    "in addition , the tight spiral structure throughout the hi emitting disk in ngc 3344 is best described with a single , constant pattern speed .",
    "+ in no case do we find that pattern speed is a smoothly decreasing function of radius , as might be expected for a winding spiral .",
    "our cut procedure , however , may introduce a bias against such spirals if they exist preferentially in the outer regions of the disks in our sample ; the radial bins covering the outer portion of three of the four galaxies where a warp is evident are excluded from our models and calculated without regularization . + even though in this case we can not characterize the patterns that may distinguish the warped regions of the disks in our sample , accurate measurements for the pattern speeds of the structure interior can , themselves , recommend different mechanisms by which warps are expected to originate and evolve .",
    "the galaxies in this sample are consistent with various existing explanations . where the spiral structure ends at olr in a warped , isolated galaxy ( e.g. ngc 3344 ) , for example",
    ", spirals themselves may be capable of exciting the warp through the non - linear coupling proposed by @xcite . in the absence of both a companion and this resonance boundary , but where the disk is intrinsically elliptical , as in ngc 3938 , the ellipticity , the warp and/or the instabilities in the disk may arise with a dm halo or the asymmetric accretion of matter ( discussed in @xmath3 [ sec : results3938 ] ) .",
    "an obvious companion , on the other hand , is a clear , potential source of tidal perturbation to the disk ( e.g. m101 and ic 342 ) .",
    "although an accompanying warp or distortion may not necessarily relate to the spiral structure at resonance , where the speed of outer structure is near the @xmath13-@xmath15/2 curve , for example , this structure may be resonantly excited ( at ilr ) by the external perturber ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ these issues , and the existence of extensive spiral structure , are best developed with a larger sample of galaxies , where meaningful trends will be more clearly established .",
    "for greatest effect , the twr calculation should be applied to higher resolution hi observations than we analyze here . in all of the galaxies in our sample ( excepting m101 )",
    "the resolution of the hi data limits our confidence in how well radial variation is constrained .",
    "it also inhibits our leverage on information extracted in the zone traced by co emission ( which we smooth to the resolution of the hi in combining the two observations ) .",
    "+ a large radial bin width likewise prevents us from satisfactorily testing the effect of variation in the co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor on twr pattern speed estimates .",
    "future studies with higher resolution observations ( and therefore more radial bins across the co - emitting disk ) may be able to better test for the effects of a gradient or arm - interarm variations in @xmath2 .",
    "we note , though , that these types of variations were found to have a negligible effect on tw estimates @xcite , and here we find that low - level variation in the @xmath2-factor produces very little change in our twr solutions for m101 .",
    "+ in general , these types of twr measurements in nearby galaxies are invaluable for interpreting observational studies of the evolution of bar and disk parameters now possible with hst .",
    "they also promise to be significant for studies at intermediate redshift , and future studies with jwst , which will extend structural parameter measurement to larger redshifts and allow smaller bars and the earlier evolution of disks to be studied .",

    "<S> current theories of spiral and bar structure predict a variety of pattern speed behaviors , calling for detailed , direct measurement of the radial variation of pattern speeds . </S>",
    "<S> our recently developed radial tremaine - weinberg ( twr ) method allows this goal to be achieved for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> here we present twr spiral pattern speed estimates for m101 , ic 342 , ngc 3938 and ngc 3344 in order to investigate whether spiral structure is steady or winding , whether spirals are described by multiple pattern speeds , and the relation between bar and spiral speeds . </S>",
    "<S> where possible , we interpret our pattern speeds estimates according to the resonance radii associated with each ( established with the disk angular rotation ) , and compare these to previous determinations . by analyzing the high - quality hi and co data cubes available for these galaxies , we show that it is possible to determine directly multiple pattern speeds within these systems , and hence identify the characteristic signatures of the processes that drive the spiral structure . </S>",
    "<S> even this small sample of galaxies reveals a surprisingly complex taxonomy , with the first direct evidence for the presence of resonant coupling of multiple patterns found in some systems , and the measurement of a simple single pattern speed in others . </S>",
    "<S> overall , this study demonstrates that we are now in a position to uncover more of the apparently complex physics that lies behind spiral structure . </S>"
