    "<S> , there is a clear evolution of the shape of the improved free energy . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the fact that there are two phases , corresponding to the small @xmath31 ( disordered ) phase and the large @xmath31 ( ordered ) phase in the ising model . at small values of @xmath31 ( i.e. in the high temperature region ) , </S>",
    "<S> the set of improved free energies form a clear plateau around @xmath49 , at which the values of the improved free energies are good approximations of the exact value . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising , because the original free energy was obtained through a perturbative expansion in small @xmath31 , and it already provides a good approximation of the exact value . as we have seen above , at @xmath49 , which is on the plateau , the fourth - order improved free energy has the same form as the original .    </S>",
    "<S> now , let us consider the case of relatively large @xmath31 ( i.e. the low temperature region ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , it is seen that plateaux develop in the regions near @xmath62 as the order of the improved free energy increases . </S>",

    "<S> ]    although the emergence of plateaux at non - zero @xmath42 in the improved free energies may signal the occurrence of spontaneous magnetization , we have to investigate the magnetization itself to determine the amount by which the system magnetizes spontaneously . in figs .

    "<S> respectively , we plot the improved magnetizations from zeroth to fourth order for @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:03 ] , it is seen that the slopes become gentle and a plateau emerges near the origin as the order increases . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:04 ] shows that the slopes at the origin become steeper as the order increases , whereas two plateaux develop near @xmath65 . </S>",
