    "total correlations present in a system can be separated in a purely quantum part and a classical part .",
    "quantum correlations can be classified as those associated with non - separability ( entanglement ) and other quantum correlations , together quantified by the quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite . for quantum information processing",
    "it is relevant to know the dynamics of these different kinds of correlations .",
    "entanglement dynamics can be considered well understood , in its general lines , for bipartite quantum systems interacting with quantum environments ( independent or common ) , presenting phenomena like sudden death @xcite , revivals @xcite or trapping @xcite , depending on the markovian or non - markovian nature of the environments .",
    "dynamics of qd has also been investigated for two - qubit systems in the presence of both markovian @xcite and non - markovian @xcite quantum environments . in this paper",
    "we analyze the dynamics of correlations in a two - qubit system where each qubit is subject to a phase noisy laser modeled as a classical field .",
    "this is a commonly used model for the interaction between light and matter , and thus the dynamics of correlations for this situation merits investigation .",
    "the broader question underlying our work is whether all kinds of behavior of correlations that can be described using a quantum environment also can be well described using a classical approximation of the environment .",
    "one might for example expect that a classical environment should not be able to store quantum correlations on its own , and that therefore revivals of quantum correlations in the system may be affected . for the phase - noisy laser ,",
    "are there qualitative features that will be lost by treating the field classically as opposed to quantum - mechanically ? among other things , we find that this model can describe both decay and oscillatory behavior of quantum correlations .",
    "our system consists of a pair of qubits ( two - level atoms ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , each driven by a local phase noisy laser .",

    "the interaction between each qubit and its local field mode is assumed to be strong enough so that , for sufficiently long times , the dissipation effects of the vacuum radiation modes on the qubit dynamics can be neglected .",
    "this could be feasible by considering , as a qubit , an atom in a cavity subject to a resonant interaction with the phase noisy laser but out of resonance with cavity mode frequencies in order to inhibit effects like spontaneous emission .",
    "in this phase - noisy model the phase undergoes a wiener process , i.e. @xmath3 is white noise with a correlation function @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a diffusion rate . in eq .",

    "it has been shown that for @xmath40 , @xmath41 oscillates while @xmath42 shows oscillatory behavior only for @xmath43 @xcite ; for @xmath44 , neither @xmath41 nor @xmath42 shows oscillatory behavior . finally , in the limit @xmath45 , the two decay rates @xmath17 become periodic functions of @xmath46 , more specifically @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in this limit",

    "an analogous but simpler setup , described by a uniform phase distribution with only two values ( @xmath51 ) , has been investigated in ref .",
    "to obtain the expressions of the correlation quantifiers we need the two - qubit density matrix elements .",
    "we construct the two - qubit reduced density matrix at time @xmath25 by the knowledge of the evolution of single - qubit reduced density matrices , according to a standard procedure @xcite , with the single - qubit reduced density matrix evolution given by eqs .",

    "note that under the dynamical conditions here considered , the two - qubit state maintains an x structure during the evolution .    in order to describe the entanglement dynamics we use the concurrence , which for an x state is given by @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the ewl states of eq .",
    "( [ ewlstates ] ) present the same initial value of the concurrences , @xmath79 , from which one finds that there is initial entanglement when @xmath80 . using the time - dependent density matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ twoqubitelements ] ) , it is readily seen that in our system the concurrence at time @xmath25 is the same for both the ewl states of eq .",
    "( [ ewlstates ] ) , that is @xmath81 .",
    "for example , for initial bell states ( @xmath82 ) and different local conditions , concurrence is given by @xmath83 .    in order to quantify total correlations , @xmath84 , present in the two - qubit system and to distinguish a quantum @xmath85 and a classical part @xmath86 of them ,",
    "we use the notion of quantum discord @xcite .",
    "the calculation of discord and classical correlations requires a maximization procedure and this has been analytically solved only for certain class of quantum states ( bell - diagonal and x states ) @xcite .",

    "for this class of states , the following expressions for @xmath84 and @xmath86 , with @xmath89 , hold @xcite : @xmath90,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",

    "the behavior for more general initial mixed states can be shown to be qualitatively similar .",
    "one sees that while concurrence presents markovian - like decay for @xmath105 , it is subject to non - markovian revival for @xmath106 , as already found in other systems @xcite . in order to evidence the fact that for large times the two - qubit system goes toward a maximally mixed state as a consequence of the unital evolution of the single qubits , in fig .",
    "[ concurrence and entropy](b ) we plot the evolution of the von neumann entropy , @xmath107 , for the same values of @xmath108 ( von neumann entropy is the same for both initial ewl states @xmath109 ) .",
    "it is seen that , for any value of @xmath108 , @xmath110 tends to its maximum value 2 , corresponding to the two - qubit maximally mixed state , with oscillating behavior when memory effects are present ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "we can also separately investigate the evolution of quantum and classical correlations . in fig .",
    "[ quantum vs classical ] we plot the evolution of total , quantum and classical correlations of eq .",
    "( [ total , discord and classical ] ) for the value of the ratio @xmath106 for initial bell states .    from the plot one sees",
    "that , in this non - markovian case , total and classical correlations show an oscillating decay while quantum discord has a non - purely oscillating decay ( i.e. , there are points of discontinuity for the derivative during the time regions where discord is very close to zero ) and it decays much faster than classical correlations . on the other hand , as seen from the inset of fig .  [ quantum vs classical ] , discord definitively disappears later than entanglement , with time regions when it is different from zero while entanglement is absent .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the dynamics of correlations between two initially entangled independent qubits each locally subject to a phase noisy laser .",
    "we found explicit expressions for various quantifiers of correlations , such as concurrence and quantum discord , in terms of the decay rates present in the single - qubit unital master equation which here describes the action of phase noisy laser .",
    "we discussed how the dynamics of correlations depends on the ratio between the phase diffusion rate @xmath5 and the atom - laser coupling strength @xmath6 .",
    "although the light field is treated as classical , this model can describe revivals of quantum correlations . for large values of @xmath108 markovian - like",
    "decay occurs , while non - markovian effects become relevant for small values of this ratio , giving place for example to revival of entanglement and of discord .",
    "moreover , in the non - markovian regime , quantum discord presents an oscillatory decay faster than that of classical correlations , with time regions where it is nonzero and entanglement is zero .",
    "it is therefore evident that the phase diffusion rate and coupling strength of each atom - laser affect the qualitative time - behavior of quantum correlations in a crucial way .",
