    "aim of this contribution is to illustrate a fully covariant model for describing the electromagnetic ( em ) decay of neutral vector mesons ( vm ) , in both light and heavy sectors ( see @xcite for a preliminary presentation of our approach ) . for the present stage ,",
    "we have considered only the ground states , to be described by using bethe - salpeter ( bs ) amplitudes with a simple analytic form , namely exhibiting only single poles .",
    "this assumption allows us to easily perform the analytic integration needed for calculating the constituent quark ( cq ) transverse - momentum distribution inside the vms ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for the pion case ) and then em decay widths . the free parameters present in the ansatz for each vm are fixed by comparing the so - called _ valence transverse - momentum distribution _ , @xmath0 , with the same quantity evaluated within a light - front hamiltonian dynamics ( lfhd ) approach exploiting the eigenfunctions of two phenomenological mass operators , presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , and able to reproduce the vm spectra .",
    "it should be pointed out that the free parameters represent an effective way for including some non perturbative features in our analytical ansatz .    a possible form of the bs amplitude for an interacting @xmath1 system with @xmath2 ,",
    "can be written as follows _",
    "( k , p)=s(k , m_1 )  v_(p )  s(k - p , m_2)_vm(k , p ) [ bsa ] where @xmath3 is the dirac propagator of a constituent quark with mass @xmath4 , @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 the four - momentum of a vm with mass @xmath8 , @xmath9 the momentum dependence of the bs amplitude , and @xmath10 with @xmath11 the polarization four - vector ( @xmath12 is the helicity ) and @xmath13 the dirac structure given by the following familiar expression , transverse to @xmath7 , ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) v^(p ) = m_vm m_vm+m_1+m_2  then , the scalar product @xmath14 reduces to _ ( p)=_m_vm+m_1+m_2 [ dstruc ]",
    "it should be pointed out that one could have two different @xmath9 s , one for each dirac structure in @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , but at the present stage we assume a simpler form , with the same @xmath9 for the two structures , that leads to the expected melosh rotation factor for a @xmath17 system , in the limit of non interacting systems , i.e. @xmath18 or @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "therefore the following comparison with the phenomenological lfhd outcomes can be made more strict .    in the preliminary calculations presented in this contribution ,",
    "the momentum dependence of the bs amplitude is given by the following ansatz , with only single poles , viz _",
    "vm(k , p)= n  _ i=1,3 [ lambda ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are free parameters ( determined as described below ) , and @xmath22 the normalization factor , that is obtained by imposing the normalization for the bs amplitude in impulse approximation , i.e. by adopting constituent quark free propagators .",
    "the form chosen for @xmath9 allows one : i ) to implement the correct symmetry under the exchange of the quark momenta ( for equal mass constituents ) , as follows from the charge conjugation of the neutral mesons ; ii ) to regularize the integrals needed in our approach for the evaluation of valence wave functions , decay constants , transverse - momentum distributions , etc . ; and iii ) to avoid any free propagation in the valence wave function , given the presence of the numerator in @xmath9 ( see also @xcite ) .    to determine @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , we have introduced the transverse - momentum distribution of a cq inside the vm , adopting the same definition already applied by de melo et al .",
    "@xcite for a covariant description of the pion . in a frame where @xmath23 , one first defines the valence component of the vm state in the standard way ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , viz . ^val_vm(,*k * _ ; m_r_i)=dk^-  s(k_on , m_1 )   _ ( p )   _ vm(k , p)s((k - p)_on , m_2 ) [ val]with @xmath24 .",
    "the normalization factor in @xmath9 ( cf eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) ) is evaluated in impulse approximation by exploiting the total - momentum sum rule , that reads for the plus component as follows p^+ =  n_c2  |_vm(k , p )    with @xmath25 and ^+_,(p , k)=tr\\{v_(p )  .. ( k- + m_2 ) ^+  ( -+m_2 )  .. v^_(p )  ( + m_1)}= = -2 ( p^+-k^+)[trace]in eq . ( [ trace ] ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the on - shell and the instantaneous contributions , respectively , according to the well - known decomposition of the dirac propagator ( see below eq .",
    "( [ bsa ] ) ) .",
    "their explicit expressions will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "notice that , after performing the trace , the dependence upon the helicity disappears , and therefore its presence in @xmath28 becomes dummy .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 vs the quark transverse momentum .",

    "the preliminary results for some static and dynamical quantities for neutral vm , obtained within our covariant description , both in the light and the heavy sectors , have been shortly presented . after calculating the valence wave functions ,",
