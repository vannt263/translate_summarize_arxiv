    "alternative formulations for the study of electroweak symmetry breaking that have the property of canceling quadratic divergences are the so called little higgs models ( lhm )  @xcite .",
    "these models are based on dimensional deconstruction  @xcite , where the quadratic divergence induced at the one - loop level by the standard model gauge bosons are canceled via the quadratic divergence introduced by heavy gauge bosons at the same perturbative level .",
    "also , it is proposed the existence of heavy - mass fermions interacting with the higgs field in such a way that the one - loop quadratic divergence induced in the yukawa sector of the standard model ( sm ) due to top quark coupling with the higgs boson is canceled  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the higgs fields acquire mass becoming pseudo - goldstone bosons via an approximate global symmetry breaking , where a massless higgs appears .",
    "quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass arise at loop level , therefore , this naturally ensure a light higgs .    as far as the littlest higgs ( lthm ) is concerned",
    ", a remarkable feature is that there is no new degrees of freedom beyond the sm below tev scale .",
    "moreover , above few tev s the lthm needs a very small new degrees of freedom to stabilize the higgs boson mass . at the tev energy scale , the arising new particles are a set of four gauge bosons with the same quantum numbers as the electroweak sm gauge bosons , namely , @xmath7 , @xmath4 , and @xmath8 , an exotic quark with the same charge as the top quark , and a scalar triplet  @xcite .",
    "the construction details of the model can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in general",
    ", these extensions of the sm predict new particles emerging at the tev scale and the new physics that could appear at these energies that soon will be tested at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "in particular , little higgs models predict the existence of a new neutral massive gauge boson , known as @xmath4 , which could offer another theoretical framework to justify the experimental scrutiny about the possible existence of heavy - mass ( at the tev scale ) particles like the @xmath9 gauge boson of the sm .",
    "on the other hand , there are several models that predict the existence of a neutral massive gauge boson , identified as @xmath10 gauge boson , such as the 331 model  @xcite or grand unified models  @xcite .",
    "these type of particles are under exhaustive search at the lhc  @xcite , where the atlas and cms collaborations have imposed experimental bounds over the mass of a new particle related to @xmath10 gauge boson , their results indicate that the mass of the @xmath10 gauge boson must be greater than @xmath11 tev and @xmath12 tev , respectively .",
    "in this work we are interested in the physics of the @xmath4 gauge boson , specifically , the main concern of this paper is to study the @xmath13 decay in the context of the linearized theory of the littlest higgs model  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this process brings the possibility of testing the lthm , since the parameters space has been severely constrained by the higgs discovery channels and electroweak precision observables  @xcite .",
    "another remarkable feature of the @xmath13 decay consists in the fact the sm background is naturally suppressed , namely , the @xmath14 reaction , since it is highly suppressed for its electroweak origin  @xcite .",
    "thus , the higgs - photon associated production opens a new window to test the gauge sector of the sm and higgs physics  @xcite . to support our analysis ,",
    "it is calculated the higgs - photon associated production at lhc coming from sm background , by using current kinematical cuts employed by atlas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "previous studies on the @xmath15 decay have been performed in the context of left - right symmetric models  @xcite , where the associated branching ratio is estimated , however , the used parameters such as the @xmath16 mass are below the present bounds established by the experimental measurements  @xcite .",

    "<S> we find branching ratios of the order of @xmath1 for the energy scale @xmath2 tev on the @xmath3 region . in order to provide a complementary study we calculated the production cross section of the @xmath4 boson in @xmath5 collisions at large hadron collider with a center of mass energy of 14 tev . by using the integrated luminosity projected for the large hadron collider in the last stage of operation , we estimated the number of events for this process </S>",
