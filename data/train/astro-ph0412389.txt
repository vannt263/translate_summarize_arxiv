    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is the nearest actively star - forming galaxy to us , and an invaluable laboratory for the study of stellar and galactic evolution . with a total mass of @xmath810@xmath9 m@xmath10 @xcite ,",
    "the lmc lies just at the borderline between dwarf and giant galaxies , in a regime where the scaling relations of basic galaxy properties ( metallicity , mean stellar age , internal structure ) with mass undergo a fundamental qualitative change @xcite .",
    "additionally , the lmc is deeply affected by the tidal forces stemming from its interactions with the small magellanic cloud and the milky way .",
    "such interactions have been plausibly connected to major events in the lifetime of galaxies , including the creation of bulges , bars , and/or thick disks ; and to starburst activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to accurately measure the histories of star formation and chemical evolution of the lmc is a major challenge for astrophysicists .",
    "while general characteristics of its evolution such as the relatively greater number of stars aged a few gigayears compared to the milky way @xcite have been known for decades , the details are only now able to be measured .",
    "for instance , it was not until the construction of the cleanest possible deep color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) from the wfpc2 camera aboard the hubble space telescope that it became apparent that the variations in field star formation rate have been largely decoupled from variations in the cluster formation rate @xcite .",
    "even these modern analyses are not without their difficulties , chiefly the extreme disparity in angular size between the lmc ( @xmath1110@xmath12 square arcminutes ) and the wfpc2 field of view ( @xmath7 5 square arcminutes ) .",
    "a major factor limiting the precision of star - formation history ( sfh ) measurements based on deep cmds is the age - metallicity degeneracy the fact that age and metallicity can be played off against one another to recreate closely similar distributions of stars in cmds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is exacerbated by the current lack of knowledge of the lmc s age - metallicity relation ( amr ) .",
    "star clusters , the most obvious tracers of such a relation , are famously scarce in the lmc for ages between 310  gyr @xcite .",
    "this age gap spans over half the age of the universe ; it includes the likely epoch of galactic disk formation around redshift @xmath13 @xmath711.5 , and probably spans four lmc - milky way orbital periods ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite draw a connection between the tidal capture of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by the lmc and the end of the cluster age gap this capture event had previously been thought unlikely ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    for these reasons",
    "we have begun to measure the chemical abundances of the field stars in the lmc : to fill in the cluster age gap , to measure the variation of metallicity with radius across the lmc , and to reliably distinguish the bar , disk , and possible thick disk or halo populations from each other . because the shape of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) is not known _ a priori _",
    ", it is important to measure the largest possible sample .",
    "the brightest common stars in the age range from @xmath7114  gyr are red giants ; in the lmc , they have magnitudes i @xmath1414.8 . because high - dispersion spectroscopy of faint red giants is extremely expensive in telescope time",
    ", we rely on spectra of moderate resolution to derive abundances good to @xmath50.10.2 dex by comparison to star clusters of known metallicity .",
    "the near - infrared calcium  ii triplet ( @xmath158500  ) is the most widely used such technique .",
    "it has been very successfully applied to lmc star clusters , beginning with a landmark paper by @xcite ( hereafter ossh ) .",
    "the results from ossh have become the standard reference for abundances of lmc clusters , and have been used as the basis for simulations of the lmc s chemical evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( hereafter pt98 ) .",
    "the cluster - based amr has in turn been taken as a guide to the amr in derivations of the star formation history based on deep color - magnitude diagrams of the field populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was not feasible to obtain large samples of field star abundances prior to the advent of efficient multi - object spectrographs , first on 4-meter class telescopes , and more recently at 8-meter class telescopes .",
    "we began to obtain abundances for red giants in two fields of the inner lmc disk using long - slit spectroscopy in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) , and expanded the sample six - fold using the hydra multiobject spectrograph at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory 4-meter telescope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) .",
    "that study found the mean metallicity of red giants at a radius of roughly one disk scale length to be [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.45 , with fewer than 10% of the rgb stars more metal - poor than [ fe / h ] = @xmath01 .",
    "we found evidence for a composite kinematic structure of the lmc disk , indicating either a velocity dispersion increasing with age , or a segregation by metallicity into thin and thick disks .",
    "paper  ii found the inner disk mdf to differ strongly from the only previous field star study , which had targeted a radially distant location ( projected radius @xmath78@xmath16 * ? ? ? * ) , in having a much smaller fraction of metal - poor stars and a sharper peak around the median .",
    "we used our abundance data and photometry to constrain the age - metallicity relation of the inner disk , finding a slow increase in mean abundance with time .",
    "in this paper , we present our measurements of the chemical abundances and radial velocities of a large number of red giant stars in the highest surface brightness region of the lmc : its bar .",
    "bar fields could not be targeted using hydra because the wide ( 2 arcsecond ) diameter of its fibers and the difficulties of sky subtraction using fiber systems .",

    "this puts the age break between the two systems at roughly 70200  myr .",
    "this is intriguingly close to the epoch of the last major interaction with the small magellanic cloud , an event which could have dramatically redistributed the angular momentum of the lmc disk .",

    "it is important to note that the bar is historically defined purely on the basis of optical appearance ( figure  [ fig - map ] ) , and the use of the term does not necessarily imply that a kinematic distinction can be made between populations with different angular momenta and energies at the same location .",

    "we do not attempt to break our bar sample into thin and thick disk components , because of the unknown influence of the bar on disk structure and because the distribution in figure  [ fig - vel ] is not particularly well - fit by two gaussians .",
    "the probability is that the stellar populations are characterized by a continuum of velocity dispersions , rising with age due to gravitational scattering .",
    "it is interesting to note that the most metal - rich stars are not significantly hotter than the neutral ism , suggesting either that the stellar disk was not strongly heated by the most recent encounter with the smc , @xmath7200  myr ago , or that the continuing gravitational interactions with the milky way and smc have kept the from cooling below this level .",
    "the derived age - metallicity plot is shown in figure  [ fig - amr ] .",
    "typical errorbars are shown at the bottom of the plot for clarity . at a given age",
    ", there is a large scatter in metallicity .",
    "part of this is certainly a real scatter , and part of it stems from systematic effects such as differential reddening or incorrect assumptions about the [ @xmath27/fe ] ratio .",
    "these effects are illustrated in figure  [ fig - sys ] . in this diagram",
    "the locations of six `` test '' rgb stars with i = 16 have been plotted in the age - metallicity plane .",
    "arrows show how the derived ages would change if the stellar spectra were contaminated with that of a red clump star of [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.4 ( blue arrows ) , if the star was reddened by an additional 0.1 mag in e(b@xmath0v ) ( green arrows ) , or if the [ @xmath27/fe ] ratio had been assumed to be solar instead of following the lmc trend ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the metallicity measurements are robust against these effects , which primarily affect the age estimates .",
    "we find 14 stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath61 and age @xmath58 10  gyr .",
    "similar populations are much less common in the data for the d1 and d2 fields ( paper  ii ) .",
    "this is not an artifact of the different selection criteria adopted : only one of these stars lies blueward of the adopted edge of the selection region in the earlier paper .",
    "as we might expect , most of the stars that the d1 and d2 selection regions would have missed are quite young , with an average age below 0.5  gyr .",
    "the presence of these stars at the blue side of the rgb indicates that young stars are much more prevalent in the bar than in the disk at a radius of one scale length .",
    "the results of figure  [ fig - sys ] suggest that some fraction of the apparent intermediate - age , metal - poor stars may be unresolved blends of genuinely ancient , metal - poor stars with intermediate - age red clump stars near the peak of the mdf . a higher percentage of blended stars in the bar than in the disk would naturally be expected because of the much higher stellar surface density in the bar field .",
    "some evidence in favor of this interpretation can be taken from the radial velocities and age estimates of the two stars that have [ fe / h ] @xmath61 that were flagged during data reduction as having faint companions ( table  [ tab - dat ] ) .",
    "2mass point sources 05225632 - 6942269 and 05253235 - 6943137 have ages , respectively , of 1.9  @xmath50.8  gyr and 7.6  @xmath55  gyr , much younger than average for their metallicities of @xmath01.19 and @xmath01.61 . depending on the properties of the faint companion objects",
    ", their true ages could be much older .",
    "because of the large random errors ( up to a factor of two ) and the possibility that systematic effects may ruin some individual estimates , the age information is most usefully interpreted when binned up to increase signal - to - noise and suppress the effects of outliers .",
    "we sort the stars into five equal - age bins 2.7  gyr wide , and show the mean metallicity in each bin in figure  [ fig - amrb ] .",
    "the five faintest , reddest stars , measured perpendicular to the rgb ridgeline ( see fig .  [ fig - rgbz ] ) , have been excluded from the averaging because differential reddening is suspected .",
    "the vertical errorbars on each point show the rms scatter about the mean in each bin , and the horizontal bars denote the extent of the bin .",
    "the area of each point is proportional to the number of stars in the bin , ranging from 10 in the oldest bin to 255 in the youngest .",
    "figure  [ fig - amrb ] shows that the metallicity steadily increases with time : quickly at ancient times , and then by @xmath570.5 dex over the past 10  gyr . the metallicity scatter",
    "_ appears _ to decrease with time , from @xmath50.5  dex in the oldest bin to @xmath50.2  dex in the youngest . for the oldest bin ,",
    "the likely culprit is the requisite rapidity of chemical evolution from [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath03 at the end of the population  iii phase to @xmath7 @xmath01 within the first 4  gyr .",
    "the fact that the errors in our age estimate are large for the oldest stars probably introduces additional scatter by creating mixing between age bins .",
    "the age - metallicity relation we derive is compared to the results from studies that have focused on specific sub - populations of stars in table  [ tab - pops ] .",
    "the first two lines recapitulate the two gaussian fits to the mdf derived in section  [ sec - mdf ] .",
    "based on the derived ages , the two metallicity components are split into young and old populations , although there is obviously considerable overlap between them .",
    "the remainder of the table shows the mean metallicities and dispersions of various stellar populations , arranged by increasing age .",
    "where we have been able to trace the published abundances back to a scale similar to that used by ossh , we have applied equation  6 to bring the values into line with our data .",
    "the picture is one of rapid evolution at early times , followed by a very slight increase over the past 10  gyr .",
    "b  dwarfs and cepheids are taken to be representative of the very young stellar populations ; their mean abundance is only very slightly higher than the peak of the metal - rich component of the field giant mdf in the bar .",
    "evidently the chemical evolution of the lmc has been quite modest over the past @xmath810@xmath74 years .",
    "very few tracers of chemical evolution at intermediate age have been available to date ; the sample of planetary nebulae measured by @xcite contains very few objects older than the oldest intermediate - age star clusters . the only star cluster with an age of 410  gyr is eso121 - 3 , with [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.93 ( ossh ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the amr appears shallow , we find the mean metallicity of stars aged 36  gyr to be [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.46 @xmath50.02 , compared to @xmath00.72 @xmath50.03 for the stars aged 68  gyr , nearly a factor of two difference .",
    "the low - metallicity component of our mdf is more metal - rich than the average of old star clusters or field rr  lyrae variables , with a higher dispersion .",
    "this indicates the continuous nature of field star formation , in that we have probed a much wider range of the lmc s history than just the oldest populations traced by the globular clusters and rr  lyraes . if we just consider the 14 stars estimated to be older than 10  gyr and not suspected of differential reddening , the mean [ fe / h ] = @xmath01.31 , with a dispersion of @xmath50.51",
    "this is consistent with the field rr  lyrae stars of the bar , although the dispersion is larger than the value of @xmath50.29 dex in the rr  lyrae sample of @xcite .",
    "models for the chemical evolution of the lmc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( pt98 ) ) , based on two different assumed star formation histories and with the yields adjusted to fit the ancient globular clusters and the numerous clusters aged 13  gyr , are overplotted on our binned age - metallicity relation .",
    "the dashed line shows the chemical evolution derived from assuming that the star - formation rate had a broad peak @xmath710  gyr ago and has been very slowly declining since then .",
    "the solid line marks instead the chemical history of a model lmc with roughly constant low level of star formation for most of its history , that then experienced a factor of six jump in star formation rate 3  gyr ago , with a subsequent rapid decline . both smooth and bursting classes of sfh can reproduce the star cluster age - metallicity relation , owing to the lack of clusters between 310  gyr old .    as found in d1 and d2 ,",
    "the field stars fill in the cluster age gap with a continuous distribution of ages and metallicities .",
    "this raises the possibility that we can statistically distinguish between the two cases .",
    "it can be seen from figure  [ fig - amrb ] that stars aged from @xmath7210  gyr will have the strongest lever on the models , with little to differentiate between them at the oldest and youngest times . for each observed star , we start from the age derived in table  [ tab - feh ] and calculate the probability that it was drawn from the age - metallicity relation appropriate to the bursting or the smooth model , taking the observational error on [ fe / h ] into account",
    ". the relative likelihoods of the models are then computed by finding the joint probability of observing the entire ensemble of stars under each model .",
    "the amount of cosmic scatter assumed in the model amr will influence the results , so we adopt @xmath75 = 0.15 as a realistic estimate .",
    "we find that the observed amr is better matched by the smooth model from pt98 than their 3-gyr burst model at the 2@xmath2 level ( 95.8% confidence ) .",
    "while the latter is a better match to the stars aged 510  gyr , these stars are greatly outnumbered by younger stars , which have higher abundances than predicted by the burst model .",
    "however , many lines of evidence point to a bursting history of star fomation in the lmc . @xcite have shown that the epoch of increased star formation rate in our bar field is likely to have occurred earlier than 3  gyr ago .",
    "figure  [ fig - amrb ] makes plain that an earlier burst can be tuned to match the stars both older and younger than 5  gyr , and so can be made to be fit the data better than the smooth model .",
    "based on the shape of the amr predicted by pt98 s bursting model , a burst would be expected to have occurred prior to @xmath75  gyr ago , but not much before @xmath77  gyr .",
    "because of the low precision of our age estimates and the uncertainties in computing chemical evolution models , a maximum likelihood calculation of the time and amplitude of a starburst from these data is unlikely to produce meaningful astrophysical results .",
    "we defer such an exercise to a future paper , in which we will simultaneously model the full wfpc2 cmds down to below the oldest main - sequence turnoff and the red giant mdf derived here .",
    "we attempted to avoid star clusters and associations as much as possible , but three stars projected directly on two clusters ( hs 256 and hs 285 ) crept into the measured sample .",
    "an additional thirteen stars ( identified in table  [ tab - dat ] ) in the close vicinity of five star clusters were also measured .",
    "considering the field density and the apparent blue colors of the clusters on our preimages , it is unlikely that the stars in the neighborhoods of the small clusters are bona fide members .",
    "neither hs  256 nor hs  285 has a published age in the literature .",
    "hs  256 partially overlaps with one of our wfpc2 fields , so it may be possible to examine its color - magnitude diagram separately from the field in a future paper .",
    "two stars of our sample , 2mass 05223416 - 6944433 and 05223895 - 6945007 , are seen in projection against hs  256 .",
    "their radial velocities are both very low compared to the sample mean , 222 and 227 km  sec@xmath3 respectively , which may indicate their joint membership in a population with low velocity dispersion moving towards us at 30 km  sec@xmath3 relative to the mean bar field . however",
    ", the two stars have very different metallicities : [ fe / h ] = @xmath01.05 @xmath50.12 and @xmath00.42 @xmath50.14 .",
    "there is no reason to suspect the quality of the abundance measurement in either star , but the widely discrepant values militate against common cluster membership .",
    "the single star seen in projection against hs  285 is indistinguishable from the general field in both its radial velocity ( 261 km  sec@xmath3 ) and metallicity ( @xmath00.37 ) .",
    "we examined maps of the area , searching for spatial patterns in the radial velocity , metallicity , and age of the stars .",
    "no strong evidence for structure in the populations was observed .",
    "however , there did appear to be a slight concentration of the reddest stars into the southwest corner of the field , near the largest of the dark clouds identified by hodge , and some small , chainlike regions ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "when comparing the 2mass j@xmath0k colors of the stars , we found the reddest stars to be far more evenly dispersed throughout the bar field . because the j@xmath0k color is less affected by reddening than is v@xmath0i , this is consistent with our interpretation that the concentration of stars with high v@xmath0i is not the effect of high metallicity or old age .",
    "the high surface brightness and extreme crowding of the central regions of the large magellanic cloud have challenged observers for decades . in this paper , we present the first spectroscopic study of the abundances , kinematics , and age - metallicity relation for field red giants in the lmc bar . taking advantage of the superb image quality and efficiency of the fors2 spectrograph at vlt - ut4 ( yepun ) , we obtained spectra of 373 red giants in a 200 square arcminute region of the central bar that includes several fields singled out for detailed photometric study with wfpc2 @xcite .",
    "we have derived abundances on a metallicity scale consistent with those of cg97 ( globular clusters ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* open clusters ) ( paper  iii ) , with internal accuracy of @xmath50.14 dex per star .",
    "radial velocities accurate to @xmath57.5  km  s@xmath3 were measured by fourier cross - correlation of our spectra with template stars of similar spectral type .",
    "we used isochrones from @xcite and assumed non - solar elemental abundance ratios based on @xcite and hill et al.(in preparation ) to make age estimates with random errors of roughly 60% .      1 .",
    "the mean metallicity of red giants in the central lmc is [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.45 , with a diserpsion about the mean of @xmath50.31 .",
    "the distribution can be described by the sum of two normally distributed populations in the ratio of 8:1 , with the majority ( minority ) population having mean [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.37 ( @xmath01.08 ) and dispersion @xmath2 = 0.15 ( 0.46 ) .",
    "half the stars have metallicities in the range @xmath00.51 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath00.28 ; only 10% are more metal - poor than [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.7 .",
    "the mean heliocentric radial velocity of our sample is 257  km  s@xmath3 the observed velocity dispersion of 24.7 @xmath50.4  km  s@xmath3 is typical of intermediate - age lmc stars . the velocity dispersion increases with decreasing metallicity , from 16.7 @xmath51.6  km  s@xmath3 for the most metal - rich 5% of stars , to 40.8 @xmath51.7  km  s@xmath3 for the 5% of most metal - deficient stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath61.15 ) .",
    "over most of the intervening range , the velocity dispersion is roughly constant around 2227  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the median age of the stars is roughly 2  gyr , with an interquartile range of 1.43.4  gyr .",
    "90% of the rgb stars appear to be younger than 6  gyr .",
    "this distribution does not linearly translate to the variation in star - formation rate over time because of strong rgb lifetime effects that bias the observed age distribution towards young stars .",
    "the age - metallicity relation is in excellent agreement with measurements of the old and young star clusters and other tracer populations .",
    "for the first time , we observe the evolution of metallicity over time through the cluster age gap from 310  gyr ago .",
    "the amr combined with chemical evolution models appears to favor an increase in star - formation rate sometime prior to @xmath75  gyr ago .",
    "the metal - rich component of the bar field mdf is similar in width to the mdf of solar neighborhood red giants as measured by @xcite , although the mean is shifted to lower metallicity by 0.2  dex .",
    "the low - metallicity tail of the mdf appears not to be present in the solar neighborhood ; this is probably because our `` birds - eye view '' from above the lmc penetrates the disk at a steep angle , including populations regardless of the details of their vertical distribution .",
    "the behavior of the velocity dispersion with metallicity is also reminiscent of the milky way disk , in which stars are born with low velocity dispersion that increases quickly with time for @xmath72  gyr , and then remains roughly constant with age until 10  gyr @xcite .",
    "in the milky way , this is taken to be the signature of the thick disk at old times . in the lmc ,",
    "the situation is less clear , and the possibility can not be eliminated that the most metal - poor , oldest stars are distributed in a spheroidal or halo distribution @xcite .",
    "the suggestion of @xcite that the apparent bar may in reality a partially obscured , triaxial bulge seems disfavored by the observed velocity dispersion , which is much smaller than would be expected for a classical bulge .",
    "the vast majority of red giants appear to be consistent with a thick disk type distribution .",
    "a box- or peanut - shaped pseudobulge , with much lower velocity dispersion than an r@xmath76 bulge , some rotational support , and stellar populations similar to the surrounding disk is allowed ( although by no means required ) by the observations .",
    "because of the very close association between bars and pseudobulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it does nt seem tenable to invoke such a feature as an _ alternative _ to a bar ; rather if a boxy structure is present , it would almost certainly be _ additional _ to a bar .",
    "the family resemblance to the milky way is less obvious when it comes to the age - metallicity relation .",
    "there is no obvious amr in the milky way thin disk @xcite , although one does appear to exist in the thick disk @xcite .",
    "our lmc bar sample shows a clear increase in mean metallicity over time , with most of the increase occurring since @xmath76  gyr ago",
    ". however , there _ are _ a few metal - rich stars among the apparently old stars of the sample , as in the milky way disk . as in the milky way",
    ", our data imply a cosmic abundance scatter of @xmath5 @xmath70.15 dex at given age ; the appearance of higher scatter at old ages is attributed to the rapid pace of enrichment in the youth of the galaxy .",
    "a further point of comparison , the possible existence of a radial metallicity gradient in the lmc disk , will be addressed in a future paper . until radial velocity and detailed abundance analyses of sufficient sample size and precision are available",
    ", it will remain uncertain how far parallels between the milky way and lmc disks can be taken .",
    "attempts to understand the lmc s morphology and star formation history in terms of its status as a satellite of the milky way have a long history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has long been appreciated that tidal interactions probably have a leading part in determining the star formation history of both galaxies @xcite , as well as the internal structure of the lmc @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results to the predictions of recent gasdynamical n - bdoy simulations of the interaction between the milky way / lmc / smc triplet @xcite .",
    "these models predict that the first era of strong interaction between the two clouds occurred @xmath767  gyr ago ; this resulted in the tidal capture of the smc by the lmc , produced the high surface brightness bar of the lmc , and initiated an epoch of enhanced star - formation .",
    "this epoch of intense activity culminated in a violent collision between the clouds @xmath73.6  gyr ago , creating the generation of 13  gyr old star clusters and raising the mean metallicity of the lmc by a factor of @xmath83 during this time .",
    "the @xcite simulations therefore predict that the field stars have a broader age distribution than the clusters , that the intermediate - age populations are centrally concentrated to the lmc bar , and that the metallicity began to increase rapidly between 36  gyr ago .",
    "these predictions are borne out by the picture of the lmc s history that has been built up in @xcite and this paper .    in this picture of a tidal origin for the lmc bar and intermediate - age clusters , a radial abundance gradient should exist , because the younger , more metal - rich populations are centrally concentrated . @xcite also predict that a small but non - negligible fraction of stars older than the first epoch of strong smc - lmc interaction will be scattered into a halo - like distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath7740  km  s@xmath3 , and with higher metallicity and lower age than the milky way halo .",
    "we will explore these issues , through direct comparison of the kinematics , mdf and amr in the bar to the inner disk ( paper  ii ) and other outer disk fields ( cole et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , in a future paper",

    "<S> we report metallicities and radial velocities derived from spectra at the near - infrared calcium triplet for 373 red giants in a 200 square arcminute area at the optical center of the lmc bar . </S>",
    "<S> these are the first spectroscopic abundance measurements of intermediate - age and old field stars in the high surface brightness heart of the lmc . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity distribution is sharply peaked at the median value [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.40 , with a small tail of stars extending down to [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath02.1 ; 10% of the red giants are observed to have [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath00.7 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative lack of metal - poor stars indicates that the lmc has a `` g dwarf '' problem , similar to the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance distribution can be closely approximated by two gaussians containing 89% and 11% of the stars , respectively : the first component is centered at [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.37 with @xmath2 = 0.15 , and the second at [ fe / h ] = @xmath01.08 with @xmath2 = 0.46 . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant population has a similar metallicity distribution to the lmc s intermediate - age star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the mean heliocentric radial velocity of the sample is 257 km  sec@xmath3 , corresponding to the same center of mass velocity as the disk ( measured at larger radii ) . because of the central location of our field , kinematic constraints are not strong , but there is no evidence that the bar deviates from the general motion of the lmc disk . the velocity dispersion of the whole sample is @xmath4 = 24.7 @xmath50.4 km  sec@xmath3 . when cut by metallicity , </S>",
    "<S> the most metal - poor 5% of stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath61.15 ) show @xmath4 = 40.8 @xmath51.7 km  sec@xmath3 , more than twice the value for the most metal - rich 5% ; this suggests that an old , thicker disk , or halo population is present . </S>",
    "<S> the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) is almost flat during the period from 510  gyr ago , with an apparent scatter of @xmath50.15 dex about the mean metallicity for a given age . comparing to chemical evolution models from the literature , we find that a burst of star formation 3  gyr ago does not reproduce the observed amr more closely than a steadily declining star - formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the amr suggests that the epoch of enhanced star formation , if any , must have commenced earlier , @xmath76  gyr ago the exact time is model - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the properties of the lmc and the galaxy , and discuss our results in the context of models that attempt to use tidal interactions with the milky way and small magellanic cloud to explain the star and cluster formation histories of the lmc . </S>"
