    "factorization theorems are fundamental to modern calculations in qcd of the amplitudes for hard - scattering exclusive hadronic processes .",
    "they allow one to separate contributions to the amplitudes that involve states of high virtuality from those that involve states of low virtuality .",
    "the former , short - distance contributions can , by virtue of asymptotic freedom , be calculated in perturbation theory , while the latter , long - distance contributions are parametrized in terms of inherently nonperturbative matrix elements of qcd operators in hadronic states .",
    "states of low virtuality can arise from the emission of a soft gluon , whose four - momentum components are all small , or from the emission of a collinear gluon , whose four - momentum is nearly parallel to the four - momentum of a gluon or light quark . in some discussions of factorization that employ soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite or diagrammatic methods @xcite , it is assumed that gluons can have no transverse momentum components that are smaller than the qcd scale @xmath1 .",
    "that is , gluons can have hard momentum , in which all components are of order the hard - scattering scale @xmath2 , soft momentum , in which all components are of order @xmath3 , or collinear momentum , in which the transverse components are of order @xmath3 and the energy and longitudinal spatial component are much larger than @xmath1 ( usually taken to be of order @xmath2 ) .",
    "this assumption is appropriate to the discussion of physical hadrons , in which confinement provides a nonperturbative ir cutoff of order @xmath1 .",
    "however , in perturbative matching calculations of short - distance coefficients , one usually takes the external quark and gluon states to be on their mass shells , and , in this situation , soft and collinear gluons of arbitrarily low energy can be emitted . in order to establish the consistency of such calculations , one must prove , to all orders in perturbation theory , that these soft and collinear gluons factor from the hard - scattering process and that the factorized form is identical to the conventional one that is obtained in the presence of an infrared cutoff of order @xmath3 . or greater , then the short - distance coefficients are independent of all infrared modes , even in perturbative calculations in which modes with scales below @xmath3 are present .",
    "this was shown to be the case in a one - loop example . however , no general , all - orders proof of that assertion was given .",
    "] in the absence of such a proof , one would have no guarantee in the matching calculation that low - virtuality soft and collinear contributions either cancel or can be absorbed entirely into the standard nonperturbative functions ( distribution functions in inclusive processes and distribution amplitudes in exclusive processes ) .    at the one - loop level , gluons of arbitrarily low energy can be treated along with higher - energy soft and collinear gluons , and the conventional proofs of factorization apply .",
    "however , as we shall see , the proof of factorization of low - energy gluons becomes more complicated beyond one loop . in multiloop integrals , in the on - shell case",
    ", one finds contributions at leading power in the hard - scattering momentum in which collinear gluons of low energy couple to soft gluons .",
    "our goal is to construct a proof of factorization that takes this possibility into account . to our knowledge , the existing discussions of factorization ,",
    "either in the context of scet or diagrammatic methods , have not addressed this possibility .    in on - shell perturbative calculations in scet , gluon transverse momenta extend to zero .",
    "hence , the possibility of low - energy gluons with momenta collinear to one of the external particles arises . at one - loop level",
    ", the soft and collinear contributions can be separated through the use of an additional cutoff @xcite .",
    "however , as we have already mentioned , at two - loop level and higher , a low - energy collinear gluon can attach to a soft gluon .",
    "the scet action is formulated so that soft gluons can be decoupled from collinear gluons through a field redefinition , but there is no corresponding provision to decouple collinear gluons from soft gluons .",
    "therefore , it seems that , in scet , low - energy collinear gluons would be treated most straightforwardly as part of the soft ( or ultrasoft ) contribution .",
    "this results in a factorized form in which the soft function contains gluons with both soft and collinear momenta and , hence , contains both soft and collinear divergences .",
    "alternatively , one can consider a factorized form in which gluons with collinear momenta are factored completely from the soft function , so that they reside only in jet functions that are associated with the initial- or final - state hadrons .",
    "such an alternative factorized form , in which the soft function is free of collinear divergences , has been discussed in the context of factorization for the drell - yan process in refs .",
    "@xcite , although the details of the factorization of gluons with collinear momenta from the soft function were not given .",
    "this alternative factorized form has also been discussed in connection with resummation of logarithms in , for example , refs .",
    "furthermore , it has been discussed in an axial gauge in the context of on - shell quark scattering @xcite .",
    "axial gauges are somewhat problematic , in that they introduce unphysical singularities into gluon and ghost propagators",
    ". such singularities could potentially spoil contour - deformation arguments that are used to ascertain the leading regions of integration in feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we believe that it is important to construct a proof of factorization in a covariant gauge , such as the feynman gauge , which we employ in the present paper .    a factorized form in which the soft function contains no gluons with collinear momenta has several useful features .",
    "one is that contributions in which there are two logarithms per loop ( one collinear and one soft ) reside entirely in the jet functions , which have a diagonal color structure , rather than in the soft function , which has a more complicated color structure .",
    "here we focus on a feature that is crucial for factorization proofs : a factorized form in which the soft function contains no collinear modes allows one to establish a cancellation of the soft function when it connects to a color - singlet hadron . as we shall explain below",
    ", if the soft function contains gluons with collinear momenta , then the cancellation of the soft function fails at leading order in the large momentum scale .    in this paper",
    ", we outline the proof of factorization at leading order in the hard - scattering momentum for the case of on - shell external partons .",
    "for concreteness , we discuss the example of the exclusive production of two light mesons in @xmath0 annihilation . in an intermediate step ,",
    "the factorized form that we obtain contains a soft function that is free of collinear divergences .",
    "this allows us to demonstrate the cancellation of the soft function at leading order in the large momentum scale .",
    "our proof makes use of standard all - orders diagrammatic methods for proving factorization @xcite .",
    "we find that the factorization of gluons of arbitrarily low energy can be dealt with conveniently by focusing on the factorization of contributions to loop integrals from singular regions , _",
    "i.e. _ , regions that contain the soft and collinear singularities .",
    "such singular regions are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , the coupling of low - energy collinear gluons to soft gluons is not discussed in those papers .",

    "we take each meson to be moving in the plus ( minus ) direction and to consist of an on - shell quark with momentum @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and an on - shell antiquark with momentum @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) :    [ p1p2 ] @xmath10 , \\\\ p_{1\\bar q}&=&\\left [ \\frac{(1-z_1)q}{\\sqrt{2 } } , \\frac{\\bm{p}_{1\\perp}^2}{\\sqrt{2}(1-z_1)q } , -\\bm{p}_{1\\perp } \\right ] , \\\\",

    "it is useful for subsequent discussions to introduce a dimensionless parameter @xmath18 in order to simplify the initial discussion , we set @xmath19 .",
    "we will discuss at the end of the factorization argument the effect of keeping the @xmath17 nonzero .",
    "let us now discuss the regions of loop momenta that are leading in powers of the large scale @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis will be somewhat heuristic , in that , as we will see , the boundaries between the various momentum types are indistinct . we carry out this analysis in order to make contact with previous discussions of factorization and to set the stage for our proof of factorization . that proof focuses on the soft and collinear singular regions of loop momenta , which _ are _ distinct .",

    "we define the soft region of momentum space by the condition @xmath37 we define the collinear region of momentum space by the conditions @xmath38 in our definitions of momentum regions , the positions of the boundaries between regions are somewhat vague .",
    "that is because there is no clear distinction between the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath39 regions near the boundaries between regions : when @xmath40 , an @xmath29 momentum is essentially an @xmath28 momentum ; when @xmath41 , a @xmath39 momentum is essentially an @xmath29 momentum .",
    "soft singularities occur in the limit @xmath42 , and @xmath39 singularities occur in the limits @xmath43 .",
    "hence , we see that , unlike the soft and collinear momentum regions , the soft and collinear singularities _ are _ distinct . there are also singularities that are associated with the scales of the collinear momenta .",
    "these appear in the limit @xmath44 . if @xmath45 is finite , these are essentially soft singularities , but they can occur in conjunction with a collinear singularity if @xmath43 .",
    "we do not consider gluon loop momenta of the `` glauber '' type @xcite , in which @xmath46 .",
    "the reason for this is that , for exclusive processes , the @xmath47 and @xmath48 contours of integration are not pinched in the glauber region , and , hence , one can always deform them out of that region @xcite .    if we take @xmath49 to be of order one and @xmath34 and @xmath45 to be of order @xmath50 [ eq .",
    "( [ def - lambda ] ) ] , then the resulting momenta are those that are treated in scet@xmath51 @xcite .",

    ", an @xmath28 line behaves as a soft line with @xmath40 .",
    "the rules for the attachment if @xmath20 is a @xmath55 momentum are the same as the rules of attachment if @xmath20 is a @xmath39 momentum . as is explained in the text , if @xmath20 is @xmath29 , and the lines to which it attaches have momentum @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then @xmath23 and @xmath24 can not both be @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",

    "now let us describe the factorization of the contributions from the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath29 singular regions .",
    "we can determine the momentum assignments that give singular contributions by making use of the power - counting rules that we have outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : leading - regions ] .",
    "when we apply these rules to the attachments of gluons with momenta in the singular regions , the symbol @xmath56 and the phrase `` of the same order '' mean that quantities do not differ by an infinite factor , while the phrases `` much less than '' and `` much greater than '' mean that quantities _ do _ differ by an infinite factor .",
    "hence , for gluons with momenta in the singular regions , our convention that an allowed attachment of a gluon can not change the essential nature of the momentum of the line to which it attaches has the following meaning : the attaching gluon can not have an energy that is greater by an infinite factor than the energy of the line to which it attaches .    the rules in sec .",
    "[ sec : leading - regions ] lead to complicated relationships between the allowed momenta of gluons in a given diagrammatic topology .",
    "however , there is a general principle , which we have already mentioned , that allows us to organize the discussion : the attachments of gluons to a given line must be ordered so that a given attachment produces a virtuality along the line that is of order or greater than the virtualities that are produced by the attachments that lie to the outside of it . in particular , the virtuality that a @xmath39 , @xmath55 , or @xmath29 singular gluon produces on a @xmath57 , @xmath58 , or @xmath29 line is of order its energy times the energy of the line to which it attaches .      the relationships between allowed momenta lead to a hierarchy of scales as the singular limits are approached .",
    "consider , for example , the contribution in which an additional soft gluon is attached to the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:2loopex ] to the same outgoing fermion lines as the other gluons , but to the outside of them .",
    "in order for this contribution to be leading , the additional soft gluon must produce a virtuality on the outgoing fermion lines that is of order or less than the virtuality of @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "the former condition implies that the energy scale of the additional soft gluon @xmath61 must be of order or less than @xmath62 . since @xmath63",
    ", this implies that @xmath64 .",
    "that is , in the collinear singular limit , @xmath61 is infinitesimal with respect to @xmath34 .    from such arguments",
    "it is clear that an infinite hierarchy of virtualities of various infinitesimal orders appears .",
    "however , these orders of virtuality are well separated in the singular limits .",
    "that is , the various gluon energy scales differ by infinite factors , as in our example .",
    "this property allows us to organize the singular contributions in such a way that we can apply the soft and @xmath39 approximations to obtain the factorized form .    in order to carry out the factorization",
    ", we need to distinguish two cases for the ordering of the energy scale of a collinear momentum relative to the energy scale of a soft momentum .",
    "both of these orderings can yield contributions that are nonvanishing in the limits @xmath42 , @xmath65 .    * case 1 : * as @xmath42 , @xmath66 is finite .",
    "( it is easy to see that the contribution in which @xmath66 goes to zero vanishes .",
    "see for example , sec .",

    "* case 2 : * as @xmath42 , @xmath67 . in this case",
    "we say that the soft singular momentum has energy that is infinitesimal in comparison with the energy of the collinear singular momentum .",
    "we will use an iterative procedure to factor gluons at the different levels of the hierarchy of energy scales .",
    "it is useful to establish first a general nomenclature to characterize this hierarchy of energy scales .",
    "we characterize each level in the hierarchy by the energy scale of the soft singular gluons in that level .",
    "we call that energy scale the `` nominal scale '' .",
    "we call soft singular and collinear singular gluons that have energies of order this scale nominal - scale gluons .",
    "we call collinear singular gluons that have energies that are infinitely larger than the nominal energy scale but infinitely smaller than the next - larger soft - gluon scale `` large - scale '' collinear gluons .",
    "the nominal - scale collinear gluons are of the type in case  1 above with respect to the nominal - scale soft gluons .",
    "the large - scale collinear gluons are of the type in case  2 above with respect to the nominal - scale soft gluons .",
    "let us now describe the factorization of the singular contributions .",
    "we make use of an iterative procedure in which gluons of higher energies are factored before gluons of lower energies .",
    "as we shall see , this ordering of the factorization procedure is convenient because it allows us to apply the decoupling relations rather straightforwardly to decouple gluons whose attachments lie toward the inside of the feynman diagrams before we decouple gluons whose attachments lie to the outside of the feynman diagrams .",
    "we will illustrate the factorization of the large - scale collinear gluons and the nominal - scale soft and collinear gluons for double light - meson production in @xmath0 annihilation by referring to the diagram that is shown in fig .",

    "now let us discuss the cancellation of the soft diagram for the factorized form in which the soft subdiagram contains collinear gluons .",

    "however , the resulting soft approximation fails to reproduce the collinear divergences that occur if the soft subdiagram contains low - energy gluons that are parallel to the quark or the antiquark .",
    "] we note that this issue also arises in inclusive processes , for example the drell - yan process , in the decoupling of the soft subdiagram from color - singlet hadrons .",

    "it is essential in establishing the standard factorized form for exclusive processes with on - shell external partons because , as we have shown , the cancellation of the attachment of the soft diagram to a color - singlet hadron fails at leading order in @xmath2 if the soft subdiagram would contain gluons with momenta that are collinear to the constituents of the hadron .",
    "this issue also arises in inclusive processes in the decoupling of the soft subdiagram from color - singlet hadrons .    in on - shell",
    "perturbative calculations in scet , low - energy gluons with momenta collinear to the external particles can appear . at two - loop level and higher",
    ", these low - energy collinear gluons can couple to soft gluons .",
    "since scet has no provision to decouple the collinear gluons from the soft gluons , it seems that it would be most straightforward in scet to treat the low - energy gluons as part of the soft contribution . in such an approach",
    ", the soft subdiagram contains gluons with momenta in both the soft and collinear singular regions .",
    "as we have said , the soft subdiagram would fail to cancel in this case , and one would not achieve the standard factorized form . therefore , in the absence of a further factorization argument , there would be no assurance in a matching calculation that the low - virtuality contributions could all be absorbed into the meson distribution amplitudes : some low - virtuality contributions might be associated with a soft function that could not be factored from the meson distribution amplitudes .",
    "alternatively , one could abandon the notion that scet should reproduce the contributions of full qcd on a diagram - by - diagram basis and assume that scet is valid only after one sums over all feynman diagrams .",
    "furthermore , one could consider the collinear action in scet to apply to all collinear momenta of arbitrarily low energy .",

    "the low - energy contributions that we have discussed involve integrands that are homogeneous in the integration momenta .",
    "therefore , one might argue that , if one applies the method of regions @xcite , then such contributions lead to scaleless integrals and vanish .",
