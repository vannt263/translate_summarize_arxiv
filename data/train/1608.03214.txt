    "has contributed to the most important and broadly applicable advances in the theory of nuclear @xmath0-algebras in the last 40 years .",
    "for example , the toms  winter conjecture asserts that finite nuclear dimension is often equivalent to structural properties analogous to those exploited by connes in his proof of uniqueness of the injective ii@xmath4-factor ( @xcite ) . in a remarkable breakthrough",
    ", this audacious conjecture was confirmed in the unique - trace case in @xcite , and has now been confirmed for much broader classes ( see @xcite ) . as another stunning example , in 2015 finite nuclear dimension led to the completion of elliott s classification program for the cases of most interest ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . in short ,",
    "nuclear dimension has revolutionized the field .",
    "it is thus important to know which examples have finite nuclear dimension . in the influential paper",
    "@xcite it was shown that all kirchberg algebras have nuclear dimension at most three .",
    "( in fact , they have dimension one ; see @xcite and @xcite . ) in @xcite szabo proved that if @xmath5 acts freely on a compact metric space @xmath6 of finite covering dimension , then the associated crossed product @xmath7 has finite nuclear dimension .",
    "his work was inspired by and depended upon @xcite , where the classical measure - theoretic rokhlin property was exported to the realm of topology .",
    "this so - called _ rokhlin dimension _ makes sense in the noncommutative context too , so we can study it for @xmath0-dynamical systems .",
    "there is mounting evidence that rokhlin dimension is for @xmath0-dynamical systems what nuclear dimension is for @xmath0-algebras : ubiquitous and fundamental .",
    "for example , it is intimately connected with nuclear dimension via the crossed product construction .",
    "one of the main results of @xcite was that @xmath8 has finite nuclear dimension whenever @xmath1 does and the automorphism @xmath9 has finite rokhlin dimension . since @xmath8 can be realized as a cuntz  pimsner algebra , it is natural to seek an extension of rokhlin dimension to the context of @xmath0-correspondences , then ask whether the associated toeplitz  pimnser and/or cuntz",
    " pimsner algebras have finite nuclear dimension ?    that is the subject of this paper .",
    "indeed , we generalize rokhlin dimension to @xmath0-correspondences in definition [ rokhlin - dimension - def ] , then prove the following .    [",
    "main - theorem ] suppose that @xmath2 is a countably generated @xmath0-correspondence over a separable unital @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 , satisfying a technical quasidiagonal - like condition ( see theorem [ main_thm ] )",
    ". then @xmath10    the quasidiagonal - like condition is probably unnecessary , and would be if a certain algebra could be shown directly to have finite nuclear dimension ( cf .",
    "lemma [ quasi_hypothesis ] ) . in any case",
    ", it is satisfied in many examples , including all finitely generated projective correspondences ( see example [ qd - examples ] ) .    as an application",
    ", we provide new examples of classifiable @xmath0-algebras in the sense of elliott s program .",
    "thanks to @xcite and @xcite , this amounts to verifying simplicity , finite nuclear dimension and the universal coefficient theorem ( uct ) of @xcite .",

    "note that we ve substantially generalized the @xmath0-dynamical system case from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) because @xmath8 is the cuntz  pimsner algebra over a singly generated projective correspondence .",
    "also , this corollary holds whenever theorem [ main - theorem ] does , so it s likely true for arbitrary correspondences of finite rokhlin dimension ( and definitely true when the quasidiagonal - like hypothesis is satisfied ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main - theorem ] follows @xcite very closely , at least in spirit .",
    "the main technical innovation is finding suitable replacements for the outgoing and incoming maps used in the proof of theorem 4.1 in @xcite .",
    "but we also have to worry about the nuclear dimension of the range of the outgoing maps , an easy task in the crossed - product case .",
    "the majority of the paper is devoted to laying out these issues , and resolving them .",
