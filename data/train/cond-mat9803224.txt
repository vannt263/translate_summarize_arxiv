    "the dynamics of attractor neural networks with randomly distributed synaptic couplings has been investigated in several works in recent years , with particular attention to the effects of the asymmetry of the synaptic couplings @xcite .",
    "this generalization is interesting not only because in the brain synapses are not symmetric , but also because it introduces new complex features in the dynamics of such systems . at symmetry",
    "higher than a critical value the system does never completely lose memory of its initial state @xcite , while at zero symmetry the dynamics have the essential characteristics of chaos in continuous systems even if the model has a finite state space @xcite ( in this case it has been shown analytically that chaos is suppressed by strong enough thermic noise @xcite ) .    at low symmetry",
    "the average length of the attractors increases exponentially with the size of the system , while for high symmetry the typical attractors are cycles of length 2 .",
    "this kind of transition takes place also in other discrete disordered dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the model that we consider here is very simple , and a detailed study of this transition is possible .",
    "moreover , the study of asymmetry is interesting in the context of neural networks , both because it drops the unrealistic requirement of symmetric synaptic couplings formulated in the classical hopfield model @xcite and because the existence of chaotic attractors can be a way to distinguish between a network converging to a regular attractor since it has remembered a pattern and a network which is in a confused state @xcite . on the other hand , the model that we study",
    "can also be seen as a modification of the mean field model of spin glass proposed by sherrington and kirkpatrick @xcite , at temperature @xmath8 ( if the couplings are not symmetric the system is not hamiltonian , but also in the case of symmetric couplings the hamiltonian of the system is different from the sk hamiltonian due to the parallel dynamics , see below ) .",
    "the model that we consider consists in @xmath2 ising neurons @xmath9 which are updated simultaneously according to deterministic rules :    _ i(t+1)=sign(_j j_ij_j(t ) ) .",
    "[ map ]    the @xmath10 ( synaptic couplings ) are quenched random variables chosen from a distribution with average value zero and variance @xmath11 .",
    "the exact form of the distribution is irrelevant in the infinite size limit , so we chose a two - valued distribution which is easiest to implement numerically @xcite .",
    "the degree of symmetry of the synaptic couplings is parameterized by @xmath12 , which measures the correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath13 :    = j_ijj_ji j_ij^2 .",
    "if the limit @xmath14 is taken before the limit @xmath15 , it is possible to apply a monte - carlo method that reproduces exactly the dynamics of a single spin in the infinite system @xcite .",
    "this approach @xcite and previous numerical works @xcite show the presence of a phase transition at @xmath16 . at symmetry larger than @xmath17 a system that was initially in a magnetized state does never forget the initial configuration , and the remanent magnetization , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the correlation function , is different from zero . at low symmetry the initial condition is completely forgotten .",
    "if the limit @xmath15 is taken in a finite system , a different situation is found .",
    "since configuration space is finite and the dynamics is deterministic , after a transient time the motion takes place on periodic orbits .",
    "the length of such orbits , the size of their attraction basins and the number of orbits are random variables , depending on the realization of the couplings @xmath10 .",
    "we are interested in their scaling behavior as a function of system size , @xmath2 .",
    "we can wonder what is the relation of this situation with the dynamics of an infinite system , where attractors do not exist .",
    "we will show that the properties of the attractors can be deduced from the statistical properties of the correlation function in the infinite system .",
    "if the synaptic couplings are symmetric are given by the hebbs rule , @xmath20 .",
    "] ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath21 ) , one can define @xcite the function    e(t)=-_i , j_i(t+1)j_ij_j(t)=-_i_j j_ij_j(t),[ener ] which is a non - increasing function of time .",
    "since @xmath22 attains a constant value only on fixed points and on cycles of length 2 , these are the only attractors of the system . on the fixed points",
    "the function @xmath5 coincides with the hamiltonian of the sk model of spin glass @xcite , @xmath23 , thus the fixed points of the symmetric networks are also metastable states for the sk model .",
    "the typical attractors are nevertheless cycles of length 2 : nearly every initial point ( in the limit @xmath14 ) converges to a cycle of length 2 . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "the value of @xmath24 is in average zero in such cycles , but @xmath5 has a low value .",
    "we observed that the lowest values of @xmath5 are attained on the fixed points , which are reached with vanishing probability .",
    "thus , under the point of view of relaxation , cycles of length 2 act as traps .",
    "let us summarize our results about non - symmetric synaptic couplings . in this case ,",
    "@xmath22 may increase and it is not anymore a ljapunov function .",
    "nevertheless , we saw that its average value is a non - increasing function also for asymmetric couplings .",
    "cycles of every length may exist , but , if the asymmetry is small , the typical cycles are still cycles of length 2 .",
    "each of them has an attraction basin of vanishing weight ( so that the average weight of the attraction basins is zero ) , but the sum of such weights tends to 1 in the infinite size limit .",
    "this situation persists up to @xmath25 , where the sum of the weights of cycles of length 2 suddenly drops to 0 in the infinite size limit .",
    "the typical attractors are now very long cycles , whose length increases exponentially with system size ( chaotic phase ) .",
    "the number of such cycles is much smaller than the number of cycles of length 1 , but the average weight of their attraction basins is finite , like in the random map model @xcite .",
    "indeed , we argue that the distribution of the weights is the same as in a random map model with reversal symmetry , as in the limit case @xmath26 @xcite is in some sense peculiar , since the average number of attractors increases linearly with system size @xcite , as in a random map and in contrast with the case @xmath27 , where the number of fixed points increases exponentially with n @xcite . ] .    between @xmath28 and @xmath29 long cycles",
    "are still a negligible portion of phase space , but the average length is dominated by the tails of the distribution , and increases exponentially with system size , in agreement with the results of ntzel @xcite .",
    "however , we prefer to place the transition between the two regimes at @xmath1 , where the nature of the typical attractors abruptly changes .",
    "we also measured the typical transient time ( the time necessary to reach a cycle ) .",
    "it appears from our data , in contrast with previous numerical results , that the transient time increases exponentially with system size for @xmath30 , and as @xmath31 for @xmath32 . for @xmath33",
    "there are two regimes : a power law at small @xmath2 ( roughly with the same exponent 2/3 as in the case @xmath32 ) and an exponential increase for larger systems , with an exponent vanishing in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with our theoretical expectations ( see below ) .",
    "the above observations hold for @xmath35 .",
    "the case @xmath36 , which corresponds to antisymmetric couplings , is related in a simple way to the symmetric case in the infinite size limit , as we shall see . in this case the phase space is dominated by cycles of length 4 for @xmath37 , while exponentially long cycles prevail for larger values of @xmath38 .",
    "the transition point is @xmath39 .",
    "we study , numerically and in part analytically , the closing probabilities , that express the probability that a trajectory not yet closed closes on a cycle of length @xmath40 after a time @xmath41 .",
    "the closing probabilities are nothing but the tail of the distribution of the correlation function @xmath42 , thus they establish a link between the properties of the infinite system and the properties of the attractors @xcite . in this framework , the transition can be understood in this way : since the distribution of @xmath43 is peaked around a much larger value than for any other value of @xmath40 , the closing probability on cycles of length 2 is much larger than for any other cycle , for a factor exponentially large with system size .",
    "this effect decreases as @xmath38 decreases , and , at a critical parameter , it is not enough to balance the large number of possible long cycles , which then prevail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we study analytically the properties of the attractors under some hypothesis on the closing probabilities .",
    "we derive a condition on the exponent of the closing probability that corresponds to the dynamical transition .",
    "we argue that the distribution of the weights of the attraction basins is the same as for a random map with reversal symmetry in the whole chaotic phase , while the typical weights tend to zero in the oscillatory phase .",
    "thus also this quantity has a discontinuity at the transition . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical results , reporting the properties of the attractors , the relaxation of @xmath44 , the distribution of the correlation functions and the closing probabilities . in the final discussion we point out possible extensions of this study .",
    "the natural distance in the configuration space of the system is the hamming distance , that measures the number of elements in a different state in two configurations .",
    "an equivalent information is given by the correlation between configurations , or overlap .",
    "let us consider the overlap between two configurations at different times along the same trajectory :    q(t , t+l)=1n_i _ i(t)_i(t+l ) .",
    "this is a random variable , depending a ) on the quenched disorder ( dynamical rules ) , and b ) on the randomly chosen initial point . knowing its distribution",
    ", we can reconstruct all the properties of the attractors .",
    "in particular , we have to compute the probability that @xmath42 is equal either to 1 or to -1 .",
    "the first case corresponds to a trajectory that , after a transient time @xmath45 , enters a limit cycle of length @xmath40 .",
    "the case @xmath46 corresponds to a trajectory that , after a transient .",
    "time @xmath45 , enters a cycle of length @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath48 has been reversed after a time @xmath40 , also @xmath49 shall be reversed after a time @xmath40 , since the map ( [ map ] ) commutes with the reversal operator @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 , thus @xmath52 will be equal to @xmath48 .",
    "we are interested in the first time when a trajectory  closes \" visiting a configuration already attained .",
    "thus , we have to impose the condition that no configuration has yet been repeated before the time @xmath41 .",
    "the closing probabilities are then conditional probabilities :    & & _ n^+(t , t)=\\{q(t , t)=1a_t } , + & & _ n^-(t , t)=\\{q(t , t)=-1a_t } , where the symbol @xmath53 represents the condition that it never happened , before time @xmath54 , either @xmath55 or @xmath56 .      taking this opening condition into account reconciles the apparent discrepancy between the behavior of a finite system @xcite and of an infinite one @xcite . in an infinite system , the average overlap after two time - steps , @xmath57 , tends , as @xmath15 , to an asymptotic value that is an analytic function of @xmath38 .",
    "in contrast , in a finite system , if time is long enough a limit cycle is reached",
    ". then @xmath58 tends to 1 with probability 1 in the oscillatory phase while it is less than 1 in the chaotic phase .    because of the opening condition we can use , as a first approximation , the properties of the correlation function in an infinite system to derive the properties of the attractors in a finite system .",
    "we list here some properties of the conditional distribution of @xmath42 which we expect to hold if the limit @xmath14 is taken with @xmath45 and @xmath40 fixed . in what follows ,",
    "the opening condition is always assumed to hold .",
    "we consider first @xmath59 .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that the behavior of the overlap at @xmath60 is related in a simple way to the one at @xmath38 .",
    "a simple argument runs like this : all the couplings where @xmath61 is positive tend to align @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so that for @xmath35 there is an effective ferromagnetic interaction between the time slice at time @xmath45 and the time slice at time @xmath41 , and an effective antiferromagnetic interaction for @xmath36 .",
    "these interactions have a different sign , but the same strength .",
    "they determine the main features of the overlap distribution : for instance , the variance and the non - vanishing value of @xmath64 ( for even @xmath40 ; for odd @xmath40 the distribution is symmetric )    1 .",
    "the overlap distribution depends exponentially on system size : + \\{q(t , t+l)=q } (-n_t , t+l(q ; ) ) .",
    "[ exp ] + this is a kind of finite entropy statement , and it can be understood as follows : the overlap is the average of @xmath2 terms .",
    "they are not independent , but their correlations are small enough so that the variance of the overlap is of order @xmath11 .",
    "thus , in analogy with the shannon - mc millan theorem , we expect ( [ exp ] ) with the dynamical functional integral . ] .",
    "weak time translation invariance : in the limit @xmath15 , the overlap @xmath42 converges to a well - defined limit distribution .",
    "we call @xmath65 the limit value of @xmath66 .",
    "3 .   symmetry : for @xmath40 odd , the distribution of @xmath42 is symmetric around @xmath67 .",
    "this can be easily proved using the inversion symmetry @xmath68 of the distribution of the synaptic couplings .",
    "it implies that @xmath69 for @xmath40 odd , and , more in general , @xmath70 .",
    "+ the variance of the distribution is larger than @xmath11 ( the value for a binomial distribution ) , since there is a positive correlation between @xmath71 and @xmath72 if @xmath10 and @xmath13 have the same sign .",
    "the closing probability is accordingly larger than @xmath73 .",
    "both the variance and the closing probability decrease with @xmath40 and increase with @xmath38 .",
    "4 .   for @xmath40",
    "even , the most probable overlap , @xmath64 , is positive and decreases with @xmath40 ( correlations decay in time ) . in the phase where there is not remanent magnetization ( @xmath74 ) the limit value is zero , and @xmath42 reaches asymptotically a symmetric distribution ( the limit of large @xmath45 having been taken in advance ) .",
    "the closing probability consequently decreases with @xmath40 and increases with @xmath38 .",
    "the limit distribution reached in the limit @xmath75 is found numerically to be the same both for even and odd @xmath40 .",
    "we denote the exponent of the closing probability by the symbol @xmath76 ( since the limit distribution is symmetric , the exponent is the same both for closing with @xmath55 and for closing with @xmath56 ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "the closing probability has a maximum for @xmath77 at fixed @xmath45 , and it is exponentially larger than for any other value of @xmath40",
    ". thus cycles of length 2 are found with the highest frequency .    in antisymmetric networks ( @xmath36 )",
    "the situation is slightly more complicate : we have to distinguish @xmath40 odd , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    * for odd @xmath40",
    "the average overlap is zero and the variance is smaller than in a binomial distribution , since the correlation between @xmath71 and @xmath72 is negative if @xmath10 and @xmath13 have opposite sign .",
    "thus the closing probability is smaller than in the case of a binomial distribution and increases as @xmath40 increases .",
    "accordingly , cycles of odd length are very rare in antisymmetric networks . *",
    "if @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) there is an effective antiferromagnetic interaction between times slices @xmath45 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus @xmath64 is negative and the trajectories close preferentially with @xmath46 producing cycles of length @xmath47 . * if @xmath78 the effective interaction is ferromagnetic , and the behavior is the same as for positive @xmath38 .    in the case of negative @xmath38",
    ", we expect @xmath81 for even @xmath38 , asymptotically in @xmath2 .",
    "thus the dominant closing probability is @xmath82 , and the most frequent cycles are cycles of length 4 . since the transition regarding the attractors is governed by the comparison between the closing probability with @xmath77 and that with @xmath83 ( see below ) , the transition for negative @xmath38 should take place at @xmath84 .",
    "simulations confirm very well these arguments , so that in most of what follows we limit our study to the case @xmath35 .    in finite systems",
    "the situation is more complicate , and some of these properties do not hold when the times @xmath45 and @xmath40 are large respect to system size . for instance , in this case @xmath42 does not reach an asymptotic distribution in the limit @xmath15 : it is easy to see that its average value has to decrease at large @xmath45 as a consequence of the opening condition .",
    "in fact , @xmath85 ( integrated closing probability ) can not exceed 1 , since it represents the probability that a trajectory closes at time @xmath54 .",
    "thus @xmath86 must finally decrease with @xmath45 and the conditional distribution of the overlap @xmath42 can not become really stationary in @xmath45 .",
    "however , as @xmath2 increases this effect becomes weaker and weaker .",
    "we are interested in the closure of the cycles , which takes place at a time - scale @xmath87 exponentially increasing with @xmath2 , and it is not _ a priori _ clear whether we can neglect these finite size effects or not .",
    "however , the predictions that can be drawn from this simplified description capture the essential features observed in the simulations .",
    "we derive in the following these predictions .",
    "we compute now the probability that a trajectory closes on a cycle of length @xmath77 .",
    "let us consider @xmath35 .",
    "we want to show that , if @xmath88 , then all trajectories reach attractors of length 2 with probability 1 as @xmath89 .",
    "we call this situation the oscillatory phase .",
    "it is very easy to go from the closing probabilities to the probability distribution of cycle lengths .",
    "the probability that the trajectory has not closed up to time @xmath45 is given by    p_n(t)(-_t=1^t_l=1^t_n(t-l , t ) ) , so the time - scale with which this quantities decays gives the time - scale of typical closing events .",
    "we introduce the function @xmath90 , which expresses the ratio between the probability that a cycle of length @xmath91 is reached at time @xmath45 and the probability that a cycle of length 2 is reached at the same time :    f_n(t;)=_l2^t _",
    "n(t - l , t ) _",
    "n(t-2,t ) .",
    "[ f ]    in the above hypothesis , this is an increasing function of @xmath45 when @xmath45 is large and the overlap distributions have reached the asymptotic value .",
    "the probability that a cycle of length 2 is reached at time @xmath45 , under the condition that a cycle was reached , is given by @xmath92 .",
    "this is very high for @xmath45 small and decreases with time , since more possible cycles enter the game .",
    "let us compute this quantity at the time scale @xmath93 : f_n(_2;)(n(2_2- _ ) ) , where @xmath94 is the exponent of the asymptotic closing probability for cycles of length 2 .",
    "two different situations occur :    * @xmath95 : oscillatory phase .",
    "@xmath90 is exponentially small up to times of order @xmath93 .",
    "but at such times the probability that a trajectory is not yet closed , @xmath96 , is very small : @xmath97 .",
    "thus , for very large sizes @xmath2 , almost all the cycles close before this time , and they are cycles of length 2 . * @xmath98 : chaotic phase . in this case ,",
    "the time scale at which most of the trajectories are close is proportional to @xmath99 , since it holds @xmath100 . at this time",
    ", @xmath101 is already very small and the probability that at least a cycle of length 2 is reached is vanishingly small with @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath102 tends to zero for @xmath34 ( as we noted above , in this case the most probable value of the overlap is @xmath103 and the distribution is not exponential ) , while @xmath104 does not vanish in this limit ( actually , for @xmath32 the value of @xmath104 is infinite , since only cycles of length 1 and 2 are found ) , and for @xmath26 the exponents @xmath94 and @xmath104 are roughly equal , it must exist a critical value of @xmath38 at which the condition @xmath105 is fulfilled .      according to the above argument , the typical closing times are given by    (n(_2,_/2 ) ) , [ trexp]and the argument predicts that transient time increases exponentially with system size , with an exponent that vanishes in the limit @xmath106 .",
    "close to this value , very large systems are needed in order to distinguish this behavior from a stretched exponential or a power law . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the most likely value of @xmath43 is @xmath55 and the exponent @xmath94 vanishes .",
    "thus the closing probability has to be computed before @xmath43 reaches its stationary distribution . in the gaussian approximation ,    _",
    "n(t , t+2;=1 )  ( -(1-q_2(t;=1))^22 nv_2(t ) ) (-(1-q_2(t;=1))2 n ) , since , for @xmath107 close to 1 , the variance goes to zero as @xmath108 .",
    "it is known from previous numerical studies @xcite that @xmath109 .",
    "thus the time - scale at which trajectories close for @xmath32 is a power - law of system size :    ( = 1)n^2/3 .",
    "[ trpow ]    this prediction is in good agreement with the numerical results in ntzel @xcite and in the present work .",
    "when @xmath38 is close to 1 , there are two regimes : at small @xmath2 , the trajectories close when the overlap distribution is not yet stationary .",
    "since @xmath58 tends to its stationary value @xmath110 as @xmath111 independent of @xmath38 @xcite , we expect and observe also in this case that @xmath112 . at larger size",
    "the overlap becomes stationary by the time when cycles close , and the exponential dependence shows up , with an exponent that , according to the gaussian approximation , is given by    _ 2 ( ) .",
    "numerically , it is found @xmath113 .      at the time @xmath114 when typical cycles of length 2 close the probability that a long cycle close goes as @xmath115 and the average length of cycles longer than 2 grows as most as @xmath116 .",
    "thus , for @xmath117 , the typical length of the cycles and the average length coincide , and they are equal to 2 . at lower symmetry",
    "very large cycles appear with a probability that , though vanishing , is large enough to let them dominate the average length . at this point",
    "the average length of the cycles increases exponentially with system size .",
    "this change takes place inside the oscillatory phase , in which the typical cycles have length 2 .",
    "we prefer to use the probability @xmath118 to find a cycle of length 2 as the order parameter to describe the transition , instead of using the logarithm of the average length of the cycles , which is dominated by the tails of the distribution .",
    "our simulations show that the transition defined by @xmath118 happens at @xmath25 , a value much smaller than the threshold where the remanent magnetization vanishes , @xmath16 , and also smaller than the threshold at which the average length of the cycles starts to increase exponentially , @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "another quantity that can be used as an order parameter is the average weight of the attraction basins .",
    "the weight @xmath120 of the attraction basin of cycle @xmath121 represents the probability that a random chosen configuration reaches ultimately this cycle .",
    "the @xmath122 s are random variables , depending on the realization of the couplings .",
    "it is convenient to define the moments of their distribution @xcite :    = _ .",
    "[ yn ]    @xmath123 is equal to 1 because of the normalization .",
    "the average weight of the attraction basins , @xmath124 , is equal to the probability that two randomly chosen trajectories reach the same attractor @xcite .",
    "let us evaluate such a probability .",
    "we define @xmath125 as the probability that the configuration at time @xmath45 on the first trajectory is equal to the configuration at time @xmath54 on the second trajectory , given that the initial configurations are chosen at random .",
    "this is , asymptotically in @xmath45 , equal to @xmath126 , if the remanent magnetization is zero , or smaller , otherwise .",
    "in fact , we expect that the overlap of two independent trajectories is asymptotically equal to the overlap between configurations at long time distance along the same trajectories , if the dynamics looses memory of the initial state ( this requires that the remanent magnetization vanishes ) , and is smaller in the case in which the memory of the initial state is not lost .",
    "predictions based on this expectation are well satisfied in other disordered dynamical systems like kauffman networks @xcite and discretized chaotic maps @xcite .",
    "thus we expect that the time when two trajectories in the same attraction basin eventually meet grows as @xmath127 . in the oscillatory phase",
    "this is much larger than the time scale over which a trajectory reaches a cycle , @xmath128 , so that we expect that the probability that two trajectories meet before reaching their limit cycles tends to zero .",
    "this is confirmed by the simulations .    in the chaotic phase",
    "the two time - scales are equal , and we expect non - vanishing @xmath129 .",
    "moreover , we expect that their values coincide with the moments of the weights of the attraction basins of a random map model @xcite , endowed with reversal symmetry , like in the previously studied case @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the computation follows exactly the same steps as in that case : in fact , the random map distribution follows only from the facts that the closing probabilities @xmath86 tend to an asymptotic limit independent on both @xmath45 and @xmath40 , and that the  transient \" regime ( small @xmath40 ) does not contribute significantly to the closure of the cycles .",
    "the result of the computation is @xcite :    = 12(n!)^2(2n+1)!(4^n+2^n ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 ... our numerical results are consistent with this prediction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_phase ] ) , although , for @xmath133 , @xmath124 is still far from the asymptotic regime for all the systems that we could simulate .",
    "we conclude the discussion of the properties of the attractors showing that the closing probabilities allow to compute the average number of cycles of length @xmath40 through the relation    ( l)= 2^n (1 l_n^+(0,l)+2l_n^-(0,l/2 ) ) ( the last term is present only for even @xmath40 ) .",
    "thus the number of cycles varies exponentially with @xmath2 . for odd @xmath40 and @xmath35",

    "for even @xmath138 , @xmath139 is also smaller than @xmath135 ( in fact , the average value of @xmath136 is different from zero ) .",
    "the two cases are related : for instance , the number of cycles of length 2 increase as the square of the number of cycles of length 1 @xcite . with our notation , this relation reads @xmath140 .    for large @xmath40 , no matter if even or odd , if the remanent magnetization is equal to zero , the distribution of @xmath141 tends to a binomial distribution with average value 1/2 .",
    "thus the average number of cycles of length @xmath40 tends to 1 for large @xmath40 .",
    "a funny consequence of a non - vanishing remanent magnetization is that in this case the number of cycles of length @xmath40 increases exponentially with a non - vanishing exponent for every value of @xmath40 .",
    "in order to monitor the transition from short cycles to long attractors , we measured 5 quantities : the probability that a cycle of length 2 is reached , @xmath118 , the average weight of the attraction basins @xmath124 ( equation [ yn ] ) , the average length of the cycles and of the transient time , and the distribution of cycle length .    the probability to reach a cycle of length 2",

    "thus the exponent @xmath203 seems not to exist , and in any case it can not be determined numerically .",
    "it is known that the deterministic dynamics of asymmetric neural networks exhibits complex features . among these features",
    ", we investigated here the transition between cycles of length 2 and  chaotic \" ( exponentially long ) attractors , first reported in @xcite .",
    "we found out that , though the average cycle length shows an abrupt change at @xmath204 , the region where cycles of length 2 are stable extends up to @xmath146 . in this region",
    "nearly all the trajectories end up in cycles of length 2 .",
    "the number of these trajectories is exponentially high and the weight of their attraction basins is vanishingly small . at lower symmetries the probability to find a cycle of length 2 drops abruptly to zero ( though their number is still exponentially high ) .",
    "the typical attractors are now cycles exponentially long with system size , whose number increases only proportionally to @xmath2 .",
    "the weights of the attraction basins seem to have the same distribution as in a random map model with reversal symmetry @xcite . the typical times",
    "after which attractors are reached , on the other hand , vary exponentially with system size for every finite asymmetry , and vary as a power - law , @xmath205 , for @xmath206 .",
    "all these features can be predicted with arguments relying , through the closing probabilities , on the distribution of the overlap in an infinite system , but the point where the transition takes place can not be computed without a more detailed knowledge of the overlap distribution .",
    "however , this transition does not correspond to a transition in the infinite system .",
    "asymmetric neural networks do present such a transition from a phase at low symmetry where the remanent magnetization vanishes , @xmath207 ( loss of memory ) and a phase at high symmetry where the remanent magnetization is finite .",
    "this takes place at @xmath16 @xcite , which is a value much larger than @xmath1 , at which cycles of length 2 cease to be the typical attractors .",
    "we can explain qualitatively the inclination of the trajectories to close on cycles of length 2 as a consequence of the parallel updating and of the symmetry of the interaction .",
    "both these elements conspire to create an effective ferromagnetic interaction between the spin @xmath62 and the same spin two time steps later ( for negative @xmath38 the effective interaction is antiferromagnetic , and it tends to reverse the spins after two time steps , thus resulting in cycles of length 4 ) .",
    "the transition takes place when the sum of the closing probabilities of long cycles balances the one of cycles of length 2 .",
    "this balance involves both the number of cycles and the weights of their attraction basins .",
    "cycles of length 2 are much more than cycles of any other length at every value of @xmath35 ( their number grows exponentially with system size with an exponent which is the double of the same exponent for cycles of length 1 , @xcite ) , but their attraction basins are vanishingly small , and , at a certain point , very long cycles , whose number grows only linearly with system size , represent the overwhelming majority of phase space .",
    "the dynamics of the system is a kind of relaxation , the function @xmath22 defined in ( [ ener ] ) playing the role of an  energy \" .",
    "this analogy is exact in the symmetric system , where @xmath22 decreases at every time step until a cycle is reached . in the asymmetric systems @xmath22 decreases in average , but not in every realization .",
    "the asymmetry introduces something similar to thermal noise in the dynamics : the average asymptotic value of @xmath5 increases when decreasing @xmath38 .",
    "fixed points are states of low energy , but they are very difficult to reach because of the competition of higher energy attractors ( either cycles of length 2 or very long cycles ) , which are easier to reach",
    ".    we can ask ourselves what changes in the above description if thermal noise is introduced .",
    "of course thermal noise destroys the limit cycles which are produced by the deterministic dynamics , but at low temperature some metastable states reminiscent of the cycles of length 2 may still survive .",
    "this discussion may be put on precise basis in symmetric networks with @xmath32 . in this case",
    "detailed balance is fulfilled with a suitable definition of the noise , and at equilibrium the statistical state of the system is described by a kind of boltzmann distribution , for which the fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds :    (_1_n)_i=1^n(e^h_i+e^- h_i ) , where @xmath208 is the local field experienced by spin @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "this statistical description does not hold anymore for asymmetric networks , for which detailed balance breaks down .",
    "ferraro @xcite and scharnagl _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite computed the asymptotic value of the energy , which in this model is defined as @xmath209 , and at @xmath210 coincides with definition [ ener ] , for the system with @xmath32 .",
    "they used the monte - carlo scheme of @xcite , which gives results free of finite size effects ( even if for computational reasons there is a limit of @xmath211 on the time steps that can be reliably performed ) . at temperatures larger than 0.6",
    "the energy follows the theoretical prediction for the sk model with remarkable accuracy , as expected in @xcite , but at lower temperatures the energy is considerably higher than what expected for the sk model @xcite .",
    "this may due to the fact that the system remains trapped in metastable states corresponding to energy minima that at @xmath8 are cycles of length 2 .",
    "as we observed , the energy of these states is significantly higher than the energy of the fixed points ( which are low energy states for the sk model ) and their attraction basins cover nearly all of phase space .",
    "we did not do direct simulations to test this interpretation , nor to see whether these states are also found for asymmetric couplings up to some critical value of the asymmetry , but we think that this could be an interesting issue .",
    "asymmetric networks at finite temperature were recently simulated in @xcite , though with langevin dynamics whose equilibrium distribution , for @xmath32 , is given by the sk model .",
    "the authors found aging effects and non - trivial overlap distributions at small but finite asymmetry .",
    "we agree with them about the absence of aging for @xmath212 : for these systems , the average overlap @xmath64 , subject to the opening conditions , reaches for every @xmath40 a time - translation - invariant state , where it does not depend anymore on @xmath45 .",
    "our data suggest that this could not hold anymore at larger values of @xmath38 ( and it can be speculated that the threshold coincides with @xmath16 at which , where the remanent magnetization is different from zero ) , but the time - window that we analyzed is to small to state anything definite about this point .",
    "the results that we present here have also to be compared with a recent investigation of the relaxation dynamics of the sk model at @xmath8 @xcite . using different kinds of dynamics , defined as reluctant , sequential and greedy",
    ", it was found , among other things , that the typical fixed points reached have different energy densities for the different dynamics ( @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 ) .",
    "the energy density that we found for @xmath32 , extrapolated to the infinite size , is higher in cycles of length 2 ( @xmath216 ) , but it is lowest on the fixed points ( @xmath217 ) , and it could be even lower than the zero - temperature energy of the sk model @xmath179 .",
    "the transition that we investigated presents some features similar to the one taking place in kauffman networks , a disordered dynamical system proposed as a model of genetic regulation @xcite .",
    "also in that case the average length of the attractors increases exponentially in the chaotic phase , where the weights of the attraction basins follow the random map distribution @xcite , and do not depend on system size in the frozen phase . nevertheless , despite the similarity between the chaotic phases of the two models , the frozen phases are quite different . in the frozen phase of kauffman model",
    "the number of attractors has a finite limit as system size increases , the average weight of the attractors does not vanish and the transient time is also finite .",
    "moreover , in the infinite size limit a phase transition corresponding to the transition for the attractors takes place , between a phase without damage spreading and a phase where a small damage propagates to the whole system @xcite .",
    "none of these features are present in asymmetric neural networks . while the transition in kauffman networks is a consequence of its finite connectivity ( every element receives inputs from exactly @xmath218 elements ) , which in turn implies that , in the frozen phase , only a finite number of elements are relevant for the dynamics @xcite , asymmetric neural networks are a system with infinite connectivity , and their oscillatory phase shows much less order than the frozen phase of kauffman networks .",
    "though being a system with a finite number of states , this system shows for @xmath26 and in the infinite size some relevant features of chaos in continuous systems @xcite",
    ". at @xmath32 , on the other hand , the system never loses memory of its initial condition . at intermediate symmetries",
    "the system shows features that are  chaotic \" and features that are  ordered \" .",
    "the analogy can be carried out also through the study of the attractors . in discretized chaotic systems  artificial \" limit cycles",
    "are present due to the finiteness of phase space .",
    "the attraction basins of these cycles follow a random map statistics @xcite , which is in agreement to what is observed here for @xmath219 .",
    "the closing time of these cycles increases as @xmath220 @xcite , where @xmath221 is the discretization and @xmath222 is the correlation dimension @xcite .",
    "this is also analogous to what is observed in the present model for @xmath219 if we identify @xmath223 with @xmath224 and @xmath225 with @xmath226 ( the fact that , even in the most  chaotic case \" @xmath26 , we find @xmath227 can be interpreted as if in this model the correlation dimension were always less than the dimension @xmath228 of the embedding space ) .",
    "but for @xmath229 the situation is less clear : still the closing time increases exponentially with system size , as if there were a finite  correlation dimension \" of the asymptotic configurations equal to @xmath230 , but the length of the cycles does not increase with @xmath2 and the statistic of the attraction basins is not of the random map type . moreover , the number of cycles increases exponentially with @xmath2 .",

    "<S> attractors in asymmetric neural networks with deterministic parallel dynamics present a  chaotic \" regime at symmetry @xmath0 where the average length of the cycles increases exponentially with system size , and an oscillatory regime at high symmetry , where the average length of the cycles is 2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show , both with analytic arguments and numerically , that there is a sharp transition , at a critical symmetry @xmath1 , between a phase where the typical cycles have length 2 and basins of attraction of vanishing weight and a phase where the typical cycles are exponentially long with system size , and the weights of their attraction basins are distributed as in a random map with reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the time - scale after which cycles are reached grows exponentially with system size @xmath2 , and the exponent vanishes in the symmetric limit , where @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition can be related to the dynamics of the infinite system ( where cycles are never reached ) , using the closing probabilities as a tool .    </S>",
    "<S> we also study the relaxation of the function @xmath4 . in the symmetric system </S>",
    "<S> , it plays the role of a ljapunov function which drives the system towards its minima through steepest descent . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation survives , even if only on the average , also for small asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this acts like an effective temperature : the larger is the asymmetry , the faster is the relaxation , and the higher is the asymptotic value reached . </S>",
