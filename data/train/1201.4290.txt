    "we study the behavior of an elastic thin beam consisting of two parts made of different materials . the interface between the two parts of the beam is fixed .",
    "our objective is , first , to rigorously prove that formation of dislocations on such interface is energetically more favorable than purely elastic deformation when the radius of the cross - section is sufficiently large .",
    "second , to derive a one - dimensional theory of elastic thin beams with a prescribed dislocation on the interface .",
    "the motivation to look at this problem relies on the connection with the study of nanowire heterostructures , which have important applications in semiconductor electronics .",
    "a heterostructure is a material obtained through an epitaxial growth process , where two materials featuring different lattice constants are brought together by deposition of one material ( the overlayer ) on top of the other ( the underlayer ) . in general",
    ", lattice mismatch will prevent growth of defect - free epitaxial film over a substrate unless the thickness of the film is below certain critical thickness ; in this last case lattice mismatch is compensated by the strain in the film . in contrast , as confirmed by experimental observations , one - dimensional systems , i.e. , longitudinally heterostructured nanowires , can be grown defect - free more readily than their two - dimensional counterparts",
    ". a better understanding of nanowires is therefore crucial in the study and use of heterostructures .",
    "a schematic of a heterostructured nanowire is showed in figure 1 .",
    "the radii of the unstrained underlayer and overlayer are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the lattice mismatch , @xmath7 , between the overlayer and the underlayer is defined as    @xmath8    for a given mismatch @xmath7 , if the radii @xmath5 and @xmath6 are sufficiently small , the system is elastically strained and no dislocation arises . ultimately , as the radii increase , the mismatch strain is relieved by formation of misfit dislocations at the interface . in the dislocated system , a small portion of the total mismatch @xmath7 is accomodated by the dislocations , while the remainder ( the residual mismatch ) is accomodated by elastic strain both in the underlayer and overlayer ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "figure 2 represents a longitudinal section of a dislocated nanowire in the atomistic picture ( where the crystalline lattice is assumed to be cubic ) : we observe an additional row of atoms in the overlayer .    a model for the critical radius",
    "for which the first dislocation appears has been developed , e.g. , in @xcite in the context of linearized elasticity .",
    "the critical radius @xmath5 is described in @xcite as a function of the mismatch @xmath7 , and is shown to be roughly an order of magnitude larger than the critical thickness of the corresponding thin film / substrate system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is , first , to rigorously justify formation of dislocations on the interface between the two parts of the beam ; then , to derive a one dimensional model describing the deformations of the beam with a given dislocation . for the second part we consider the case of one misfit dislocation , though our analysis extends as well to the case of more dislocations without any additional difficulty .",
    "more precisely , we consider a cylindrical region @xmath9 , which represents the reference configuration of the beam , where @xmath10 is the disk of radius @xmath6 in @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a small positive parameter , which , in the atomistic picture , is of the order of the atomic distance .",
    "theorem [ mainthm35 ] shows that when @xmath6 is sufficiently large , formation of dislocations is energetically more favorable than purely elastic deformation .",
    "in the second part of the paper , we prescribe the dislocation .",
    "we assume that the dislocation line , @xmath14 , has the form @xmath15 where @xmath1 is a lipschitz , relatively closed curve in @xmath10 .",
    "the latter condition implies that @xmath16 is not simply connected .",
    "we assume that the elastic energy ( per unit cross - section ) has the form    @xmath17    where @xmath18 satisfies :    @xmath19    in the sense of distributions . in",
    ", the vector @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , denotes the burgers vector , which , together with the dislocation line , uniquely characterizes the dislocation .",
    "we observe that any field @xmath22 satisfying is locally the gradient of a sobolev map . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath23 is simply connected , then there exists @xmath24 such that @xmath25 a.e . in @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath1 is a closed loop in @xmath10 , one can take @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the flat region enclosed by the curve @xmath1 ( @xmath30 is the shadowed set in figure [ reference ] ) . then , @xmath31 a.e . in @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and its distributional gradient satisfies    @xmath34    therefore @xmath31 is the absolutely continuous part ( with respect to lebesgue measure ) of the gradient @xmath35 .",
    "following @xcite , we interpret @xmath22 as the elastic part of the deformation .",
    "more in general , @xmath22 may be regarded as the elastic part of a deformation which has a constant jump , equal to @xmath20 , across any surface having @xmath14 as its boundary .",
    "the domain of the energy functional is thus defined as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 . indeed ,",
