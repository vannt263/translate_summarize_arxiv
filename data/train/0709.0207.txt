    "it then follows that the same is true in almost all characteristics , however for any given characteristic almost nothing is known .",
    "it is a difficult question to determine over which fields one has @xmath29 and , if not , what these characters are .",
    "it has been known since the original papers of kazhdan and lusztig ( @xcite and @xcite ) that in non - simply laced cases the intersection cohomology complexes may have a different character in characteristic 2 .",
    "( this happens , for example , in the only non - smooth schubert variety in the flag variety of @xmath30 . ) in 2002 braden discovered examples of schubert varieties in simply laced types @xmath31 and @xmath32 where the character of the interesection cohomology sheaf in characteristic 2 is different to all other characteristics ( see the appendix ) .    in this article",
    "we define combinatorially a certain subset @xmath33 of _ separated elements _ and show :    [ thm - sep ] suppose that @xmath34 , then @xmath29 for any field @xmath8 .",

    "a conjecture of lusztig @xcite expresses the characters of the simple modules @xmath54 in terms of the ( known ) characters of standard modules .",
    "a particular case of the conjecture is the following : let @xmath55 denote the half - sum of the positive roots , and @xmath56 the steinberg weight , then it is conjectured that , for all @xmath57 , @xmath58 = h_{x , y}(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath59 $ ] is the kazhdan - lusztig polynomial indexed by @xmath57 .",
    "a theorem of soergel @xcite says that ( [ eq : lusztig ] ) is equivalent to the semi - simplicity of @xmath60 for all @xmath61 and @xmath35 .    of course",
    ", in order to apply theorems [ thm - sep ] and [ thm - dec ] it is necessary to know the set @xmath44 .",
    "the essential ingredient in the calculation of @xmath44 is the @xmath0-graph of the coxeter system @xmath20 .",
    "unfortunately , even in simple situations the @xmath0-graph can be very complicated and no general description is known .",
    "however , using fokko du cloux s program _ coxeter _",
    "@xcite it is possible to use a computer to determine the set @xmath44 for low rank weyl groups .",
    "the simplest situation is when @xmath62 .",
    "this only occurs in type a in low rank :    [ thm : a6 ] if @xmath10 is of type @xmath2 for @xmath63 then @xmath62 .",
    "hence , in all characteristics the intersection cohomology complexes have characters given by kazhdan - lusztig basis elements and the decomposition theorem holds for @xmath64 for all @xmath35 and @xmath61 .",
    "it also follows that ( [ eq : lusztig ] ) holds for @xmath65 with @xmath5 if @xmath8 has characteristic at least @xmath66 . using results of braden in the appendix , we are also able to extend this theorem to cover @xmath47 of type @xmath32 .    in other types and type @xmath2 for @xmath67 our techniques are not as effective . in most examples that we have computed",
    "@xmath44 is not the entire weyl group .",
    "however , we are able to confirm the characters and decomposition theorem for many intersection cohomology complexes in ranks @xmath68 .",
    "it also seems that the elements @xmath69 for which our methods fail will provide an interesting source of future research .",
    "indeed in the appendix braden shows that , both in type @xmath32 and @xmath31 , if @xmath8 is of characteristic 2 , then for minimal elements in @xmath70 one has @xmath71 .",
    "these two examples , combined with the case of dihedral groups , leads one to suspect a close relationship between @xmath70 and those intersection cohomology complexes for which one has @xmath72 for some field of coefficients @xmath8 .",
    "let us briefly mention that , in @xcite braden and macpherson give an algorithm for the calculation of the stalks of the intersection cohomology complexes , using only the fixed points and one - dimensional orbits of a maximal torus on the flag variety .",
    "( this data is encoded in the so - called `` moment graph '' of the flag variety . )",
    "the forthcoming paper @xcite of fiebig and the author extends this result , showing that the moment graph of the flag variety can be used to calculate the characters of parity sheaves , and hence determine those intersection cohomology complexes for which @xmath71 .",
    "thus the results of this paper could ( at least in principle ) be deduced from the moment graph .",
    "in fact , the computations of torsion in the appendix translate easily into the moment graph language and give a proof that the moment graph sheaves corresponding to certain bott - samelson varieties do not split as expected unless @xmath73 is invertible in the coefficient ring",
    "lastly , in this article we only consider field coefficients",
    ". however versions of the intersection cohomology complex exist with coefficients in @xmath74 and the statement that @xmath75 for a field of characteristic @xmath76 is equivalent to the absence of @xmath76-torsion in the stalks and costalks of an intersection cohomology complex over @xmath74 .",

    "the map @xmath643 gives the required isomorphism of @xmath613 with @xmath614 .",
    "the fiber @xmath310 is not smooth , but there is only one component of dimension four , so we can reduce the computation of @xmath598 to the smooth case : it is isomorphic to the restriction map @xmath644 , where @xmath545 is the total space of the normal bundle @xmath562 to @xmath609 in @xmath645 .",
    "as remarked earlier , @xmath646 can be identified with multiplication by the euler class @xmath647 , so the image of @xmath598 is spanned by @xmath566 .",

    ", we can compute that its @xmath417-weight is the sum of the entries under @xmath667 and @xmath668 in the following tables :        the equivariant class @xmath671 induces the same class in @xmath672 as @xmath673 where we abuse notation and write a weight @xmath674 instead of its pullback under the map @xmath675 . after a little computation one sees that this class restricts to zero at every point of @xmath676 except @xmath677 and @xmath678 , where it has the same restriction as @xmath679 , the equivariant euler class of the tangent bundle to @xmath609 .",

    "the excess intersection formula then implies that matrix of @xmath598 is diagonal under the natural bases given by the components of @xmath691 ( in other words , the components are orthogonal under the intersection form ) . the normal bundle to the component",
