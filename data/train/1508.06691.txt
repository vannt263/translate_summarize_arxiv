    "an interesting feature of a non @xmath16-wave fermi condensate is that it may have plural superfluid phases , originating from active orbital and/or spin degrees of freedom . indeed",
    ", this possibility has experimentally been confirmed in various fermi superfluid systems , such as heavy fermion superconductor upt@xmath17 @xcite , as well as superfluid liquid @xmath18he @xcite .",
    "however , the pairing symmetry that has already been realized is still only the simplest @xmath16-wave one in cold fermi gas physics @xcite .",
    "thus , going beyond this situation is a crucial challenge in this research field .    in this regard ,",
    "a @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas is a strong candidate , and the possibility of this spin - triplet pairing state has extensively been discussed both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "several experimental groups have discovered a @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance in @xmath5k @xcite and @xmath19li @xcite fermi gases , so that we can now tune the strength of a @xmath0-wave interaction from the weak - coupling regime to the strong - coupling regime , by adjusting an external magnetic field .",
    "this experimental development has realized @xmath0-wave feshbach molecules @xcite .",
    "thus , although one still needs to overcome some difficulties , such as the three - body loss @xcite , as well as the dipolar relaxation @xcite ( that destroy @xmath0-wave molecules @xcite ) , the @xmath0-wave superfluid state seems a very promising non @xmath16-wave pairing state in an ultracold fermi gas .",
    "it has been predicted @xcite that , when a @xmath0-wave interaction has a uniaxial anisotropy , a @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas may have two superfluid phases with different @xmath0-wave pairing symmetries .",
    "such an anisotropic @xmath0-wave pairing interaction is considered to be realized in a @xmath5k fermi gas @xcite , because the split of a @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance into a @xmath7-wave channel and degenerate @xmath14-wave and @xmath15-wave channels by a magnetic dipole - dipole interaction has been observed , when an external magnetic field is applied in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "since the observed resonance field of a @xmath7-wave feshbach resonance is higher than that of the other degenerate channels @xcite , a @xmath0-wave pairing interaction associated with this @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance has the uniaxial anisotropy , that is , a @xmath7-wave pairing interaction @xmath21 is stronger than @xmath14-wave ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath15-wave ( @xmath23 ) interactions . as a result , the @xmath7-wave superfluid state has the highest superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath24 . in this case , refs .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the system experiences the other phase transition from the @xmath7-wave state to the @xmath11-wave state at @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , when the uniaxial anisotropy satisfies a certain condition .",
    "thus , the realization of a @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas would enable us to study physics of plural superfluid phases , from the weak - coupling regime to the strong - coupling limit in a systematic manner .",
    "when the above - mentioned @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas is realized , the existence of strong pairing fluctuations near @xmath9 is an interesting research topic . in the @xmath7-wave superfluid phase ,",
    "since single - particle excitations are gapless in the nodal direction ( @xmath25 ) of the @xmath7-wave superfluid order parameter @xmath26 , @xmath14-wave and @xmath15-wave pairing fluctuations can continue developing , to be the strongest at @xmath9 .",
    "thus , even far below @xmath24 , an anisotropic pseudogap phenomenon is expected in the nodal direction of the @xmath7-wave superfluid order parameter near @xmath9 .    in an isotropic @xmath16-wave superfluid fermi gas , since the bcs gap opens in all the momentum direction of single - particle excitations , pairing fluctuations are soon suppressed below the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that a pseudogap in the density of states above @xmath27 @xcite soon changes to the @xmath16-wave bcs superfluid gap below @xmath27 @xcite . even in the @xmath7-wave case",
    ", the enhancement of pairing fluctuations around the node would not occur in the absence of a @xmath14-wave and a @xmath15-wave interactions , because @xmath7-wave pairing fluctuations are soon suppressed by the @xmath7-wave superfluid order below @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the above - mentioned pseudogap phenomenon in the @xmath7-wave state near @xmath9 is peculiar to an unconventional fermi superfluid with a nodal superfluid order parameter , as well as with plural superfluid phases .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically investigate strong - coupling properties of a one component @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas with a uniaxially anisotropic @xmath0-wave pairing interaction ( @xmath1 ) . including @xmath0-wave pairing fluctuations within the framework of a strong coupling @xmath6-matrix approximation , we determine @xmath24 and @xmath9 . in the @xmath7-wave superfluid phase",
    ", we calculate the angle - resolved single - particle density of states , to clarify that pairing fluctuations in the nodal direction ( @xmath25 ) of the @xmath7-wave superfluid order parameter continue to develop , leading to a pseudogapped single - particle excitation spectrum in the nodal direction .",
