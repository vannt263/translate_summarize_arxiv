    "the chirality of molecules in living organisms must have been fixed at an early stage in the development of life .",
    "all life that we know is based on rna and dna molecules with dextrarotatory sugars .",
    "there is growing evidence that the rna world ( woese , 1967 ; crick , 1968 ; orgel , 1968 ; see also wattis & coveney 1999 ) must have been preceded by a simpler pre - rna world made up of achiral constituents ( bada , 1995 , nelson _",

    ". these can be rather simple and are currently discussed in connection with the idea to build artificial life ( rasmussen _ et al . , _",
    "2003 ) . furthermore",
    ", although pna can still be chiral ( tedeschi _ et al . , _ 2002 ) , there are also forms of pna that are achiral ( pooga _ et al . , _ 2001 ) , suggesting that chirality may have developed later when the first rna molecules formed .    in current proposals to build artificial life",
    ", chirality does not seem to be crucial .",
    "the pna molecules is proposed to act primarily as charge carrier , i.e.  a very primitive functionality compared to the genetic code in contemporary cells ( rasmussen _ et al . , _",
    "2003 ) . at this stage ,",
    "homochirality may have been introduced by chance .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that chiral polymers of the same chirality tend to have a more stable structure ( pogodina _ et al . , _ 2001 ) and would therefore be genetically preferred .    since the introduction of chiral molecules",
    "is assumed to take place at a stage when there is already growth and self - replication , it is also plausible to assume that the existence of chiral molecules has an autocatalytic effect in producing new chiral molecules of the same chirality ( kondepudi _ et al . , _",
    "this is the basis of the recently proposed polymerization model of sandars ( 2003 ) ; see also wattis & coveney ( 2004 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to reconsider this model ( or a slightly modified version of it ) and to analyze its stability behavior and conservation properties .",
    "we also discuss and illustrate some of the salient features of the model in more detail .",
    "the model is then compared with earlier models of homochirality where the detailed polymerization process is ignored and the dynamics of single variables representing left and right handed polymers are modeled instead ( frank , 1953 ; kondepudi and nelson , 1984 ; goldanskii and kuzmin 1989 ; avetisov and goldanskii , 1993 ; saito and hyuga , 2004 ) .    in order to appreciate the nature of the many terms in the model of sandars we begin by discussing first the basic principle of the model in connection with homochiral polymer growth and then turn to the full set of reactions that are included in the model .",
    "in this section we discuss the growth of polymers by adding monomers of the same chirality , i.e.  we ignore reactions with monomers of the opposite chirality .",
    "this is conceptually the simplest case , but its equilibrium solution also corresponds to a solution of the full system discussed below .",
    "we write down the equations for left - handed polymers , but the same applies also to right - handed polymers .    a left - handed polymer of length @xmath0",
    "is assumed to react with a left - handed monomer via the reaction @xmath1 the reaction rate is @xmath2 , but since @xmath3 can bind to @xmath4 on either side , the total reaction rate is @xmath5 and proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two constituents .",

    "this assumption imposes a dependence on the cutoff value @xmath29 , a dependence that should preferably be avoided in numerical or other technical considerations .",
    "the model should for example be stable and consistent in the limit when @xmath29 is infinite .",
    "another option would be to assume @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath49 is a fixed value that is independent of the maximum chain length .",
    "both alternatives have the disadvantage that @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] can never grow unless @xmath52 $ ] or @xmath53 $ ] are initially also finite . while it is plausible that long chains carry more catalytic weight than shorter ones , the dependence of the results on the particular choice of @xmath54 seems artificial .",
    "( the allowance of finite values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 would remove this problem , although in practice both of these values should still be quite small . )    on may expect that the catalytic properties of the existing left and right handed polymers depend on the length of the polymer . the exact functional expression for this dependence is not known .",
    "it is therefore important that a model that explains homochirality is not sensitive to the details of the catalytic properties and hence the functional form of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it turns out that the qualitative behavior of the model of sandars is indeed robust in this respect , e.g.  a pitchfork bifurcation exists in both sandars original and in our model . to avoid artificial dependence on the maximal chain length @xmath29 , we chose to let the catalytic functions have the following form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is given by eq .",

    "( [ lnb ] ) were applied to @xmath64 , but he introduced an explicit linear damping term instead .",
    "this implies that the model behaves discontinuously at the end of the chain .",
    "we feel that an `` extrapolating '' ( continuous ) behavior is more reasonable , so we choose to apply eq .",
    "( [ lnb ] ) also at @xmath64 .    .",
    "the time difference between the different curves is @xmath65 .",
    "we have shown the first and last times as solid and dashed lines , and all other times as dotted lines .",
    "the parameters are @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ]",
    "it is interesting to note that in the continuous limit , eq .  ( [ lnb ] ) becomes @xmath68 { \\partial\\over\\partial n}\\right)[l_n]=0,\\ ] ] which describes waves traveling toward larger @xmath0 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ pwave ] , where we have perturbed the equilibrium solution ( [ homochiralequilib ] ) by a gaussian and have solved eqs .",
    "( [ l1b])([lnb ] ) numerically .",
    "the wave is damped and has a speed that is proportional to @xmath69 , because for the steady state background solution @xmath50\\sim ( k_s / q)^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "note that the extrapolating boundary condition at @xmath64 allows the wave to escape freely .",
    "in this paper we do not adopt the nondimensionalization of sandars .",
    "instead , we note that there are only two physical dimensions in this problem : time and volume .",
    "characteristic quantities with the dimensions of time and volume are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "we therefore present all results by explicitly quoting these dimensions . in practice",
    "this means that from now on we use @xmath72 as numerical values , but we keep the symbols in the equations for clarity . throughout this paper",
    "we also assume @xmath67 ; calculations with different values do not seem to affect our results in any important way .",
    "the fact that the equilibrium solution is constant for all @xmath30 implies that this value will decrease for longer choices of @xmath29 . in that sense",
    "the solution is never converged .",
    "this situation changes when we allow the ends of the left - handed polymers to be spoiled by right - handed monomers , as done by sandars ( 2003 ) .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "already 20 years ago , joyce _ et al . , _ ( 1984 ) showed in an important paper describing experiments with template - directed polymerization that , once a monomer of the opposite chirality is bound to one end of the chain , the polymerization terminates on that end of the chain .",
    "sandars ( 2003 ) incorporated this effect in his model and showed that this can lead to a bifurcation into two possible solutions of opposite chirality and hence to homochirality .",
    "the full set of reactions included in his model is ( for @xmath73 ) @xmath74 and for all four equations we have the complementary reactions obtained by exchanging @xmath75 .",
    "following sandars ( 2003 ) , we have introduced the new parameter @xmath76 , which quantifies that rate of enantiomeric cross - inhibition .",
    "the special case @xmath77 corresponds to the case discussed in the previous section .",
    "the most important effect of enantiomeric cross - inhibition is that a certain fraction of chains becomes spoiled by producing @xmath78 and @xmath79 polymers",

    "the model of saito and hyuga ( 2004 ) , hereafter the sh model , does capture the expected behavior , but it remains unsatisfactory in that its functional form has been introduced ad hoc .",
    "it is therefore desirable to derive simple model equations based on the polymerization equations of sandars ( 2003 ) .",
    "it turns out that , without changing the basic properties of the model , a minimal version is still meaningful for @xmath156 , and that the equations for the semi - spoiled polymers , @xmath157 $ ] and @xmath158 $ ] , can be ignored ( as already done by sandars ) .",
    "thus , we only solve eqs .",
    "( [ ln_new2 ] ) and  ( [ rn_new2 ] ) together with eqs .",
    "( [ l1r1])([lambdar ] ) .",
    "following sandars ( 2003 ) , we also assume that @xmath159 $ ] and @xmath160 $ ] ( instead of @xmath161 and @xmath162 , which would yield more complicated expressions ) .",
    "a further simplification can be made by regarding @xmath163 $ ] as a rapidly adjusting variable that is enslaved to @xmath50 $ ] ( and similarly for @xmath164 $ ] ) .",
    "this technique is also known as the adiabatic elimination of rapidly adjusting variables ( e.g. , haken , 1983 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ ln_new2 ] ) becomes @xmath165 ^ 2 - 2[l_2]\\big(k_s[l_1]+k_i[r_1]\\big),\\ ] ] which is solved for @xmath163 $ ] ( and similarly for @xmath164 $ ] ) , which in turn couples back to the equations for @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] via @xmath24 and @xmath33 .",
    "finally , we also treat the substrate @xmath34 $ ] as a rapidly adjusting variable , i.e.  we have @xmath166=q/([l_2]+[r_2])$ ] .",
    "we emphasize that the adiabatic elimination does not affect the accuracy of steady solutions .",
    "it is convenient to introduce new dimensionless variables , @xmath167(2k_s / q)^{1/2},\\quad y=[l_1](2k_s / q)^{1/2},\\quad \\tau = t(qk_s/2)^{1/2}.\\ ] ] in order to compare first with the sh model we restrict ourselves to the special case @xmath168 , which leads to the revised model equations @xmath169 where dots denote derivatives with respect to @xmath170 and @xmath151 and @xmath171 has been introduced for brevity .",
    "equations ( [ modeleqn ] ) resemble the equations of the sh model in that both have a quadratic term proportional to @xmath172 ( or @xmath173 ) , which is quenched either by a @xmath174 factor ( in the sh model ) or by a @xmath175 factor in our model .",
    "furthermore , both models have a backreaction term proportional to @xmath176 ( or @xmath177 ) , but the coefficient in front of this term ( @xmath152 in the sh model ) is not constant but equal to @xmath178 .    ) for two different values of @xmath108 .",
    "the starting points of each trajectory are marked by small dots and stable fixed points are marked by big dots . ]    in the general case with @xmath179 , @xmath127 , as well as finite values of @xmath180 , and @xmath181 , the equations read @xmath182 where we have introduced the abbreviations @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 .    in figure  [ pruns051 ]",
    "we show trajectories of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ modeleqnf ] ) for two different values of @xmath108 in an @xmath190 phase diagram .",
    "note that all equilibrium solutions lie on the line @xmath191 .",
    "this property allows us to calculate equilibrium solutions for general values of @xmath108 .",
    "inserting @xmath192 yields a cubic equation of which one solution is always @xmath193 .",
    "this reduces the problem to a quadratic equation with the solution @xmath194 linearizing the equations around the racemic solution , @xmath195 , yields the growth rate @xmath196 in agreement with our numerical results for large values of @xmath29 , this equation gives a linear dependence of the growth rate on the fidelity .",
    "this result also shows that for @xmath197 perturbations decay exponentially .    ) for @xmath198 and @xmath199 using the newton - raphson method . ]    in the presence of a biased , non - catalytic generation of monomers ( finite @xmath200 or @xmath201 with @xmath202 ) there is no longer a perfectly racemic equilibrium solution .",
    "the sign of @xmath123 for the solution for @xmath112 depends on the sign of @xmath203 . along this solution branch @xmath123",
    "goes further away from zero in a continuous fashion until @xmath109 . at some value of @xmath108",
    "a pair of new solutions emerges , one is stable and the other one unstable , but both have the opposite sign of @xmath123 ; see figure  [ pbranches ] . among these new branches ,",
    "the stable one can only be reached via a finite amplitude perturbation .",
    "this behavior is called an imperfect bifurcation and has long been anticipated in this context ( kondepudi and nelson , 1983 ; kondepudi _ et al . , _ 1986 ; goldanskii and kuzmin , 1989 ) .    the steady solutions shown in figure  [ pbranches ]",
    "have been obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ modeleqnf ] ) using the newton - raphson method .",
    "this method allows us to find both stable and unstable solutions .",
    "near the bifurcation point the diagram is extremely sensitive to the addition of a bias parameter .",
    "it is remarkable that for a value as small as @xmath204 a relatively large gap has been produced in the bifurcation diagram .",
    "finite values of @xmath200 and @xmath201 could result from physical influences , for example polarized synchrotron radiation from neutron stars ( but see bonner , 1999 ) , uv radiation in star - forming regions ( bailey , 2001 ) , or the parity violation of the electroweak force ( e.g. , hegstrom , 1984 ) .",
    "in all these cases the expected effect is however very small ( bada , 1995 ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the main reason for homochirality is the instability of the racemic ( or nearly racemic ) solution , which is hardly modified by a finiteness of @xmath200 or @xmath201 .",
    "the origin of homochirality has long been thought to be the result of a bifurcation process that can vastly amplify a very small random enantiomeric excess which can then prevail forever .",
    "generic model equations reproducing the expected bifurcation behavior have so far mostly been proposed on an ad hoc basis .",
    "it was therefore difficult to establish a connection between model and reality . according to the work of saito and hyuga ( 2004 ) one expects two effects to be important : nonlinearity and backreaction .",
    "however , the functional form of these terms remained open .",
    "furthermore , the meaning of non - perfect catalytic fidelity and enantiomeric cross - inhibition within the framework of the model were not clear . in the present paper",
    "we have established a direct connection between the more detailed polymerization model of sandars ( 2003 ) and the simpler model equation approach with only two ordinary differential equations .",
    "in particular , the present work has confirmed that the relevant nonlinearity is indeed quadratic ( as in the sh model ) , but it is not quenched like @xmath174 , but rather like @xmath175 , where @xmath178 and @xmath205 are measures of the total concentrations of monomers ( both right and left handed ) .",
    "furthermore , the feedback coefficient is not a small constant , as in the sh model , but it is itself proportional to @xmath178 . more importantly ,",
    "imperfect fidelity and enantiomeric cross - inhibition , as well as the effects of a weakly biased non - catalytic production of new monomers , have a quantitative meaning within the framework of the reduced model .    for a more quantitative comparisons of the polymerization process with experiments",
    "the full set of equations of sandars ( with the revisions discussed above ) is to be preferred . a number of features that can only be captured by the full model .",
    "an example is the wave - like propagation in the distribution of homochiral polymers .",
    "an experimental confirmation would help to quantify the growth coefficient @xmath2 characterizing the probability that a polymer grows by a monomer of the same chirality . on the other hand ,",
    "the growth coefficient for enantiomeric cross - inhibition , @xmath76 , determines primarily the minimum fidelity parameter , @xmath108 , above which bifurcation and hence homochiral growth is at all possible .",
    "it is indeed quite remarkable , that the main reason homochiral growth occurs is that binding with a wrong enantiomer spoils further polymerization on the corresponding end of the chain .",
    "this leads to competition which is always a key feature of natural selection processes such as these .",
    "homochirality in living organisms is a singular phenomenon .",
    "non - living chemical systems do in general not have a preferred chirality . in the models presented in this paper this",
    "is reflected in figs  [ bifurc ] and [ pbranches ] .",
    "the region of the phase diagram displaying homochirality is characterized by high fidelity , i.e.  high auto - catalytic accuracy .",
    "the fidelity is expected to be significantly higher in living systems .",
    "when an organism dies the auto - catalytic polymerization stops and as a consequence the fidelity is sharply decreased .",
    "the characteristic behavior of the polymerization changes from the chiral to the racemic region of the phase diagram .",
    "the relaxation of the system from the homochiral to the racemic state is often very slow .",
    "it was in fact suggested by hare and mitterer ( 1967 ) and later by bada _",
    "et al . , _ ( 1970 ) that racemization of amino acids in fossil material could be used as a dating method .",
    "unfortunately it has turned out that the rate of racemization is strongly temperature dependent , which tends to make this dating method unreliable .",
