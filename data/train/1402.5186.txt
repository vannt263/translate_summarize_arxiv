    "the construction of a high quality mesh , in general , takes the most of the analysis time @xcite . the recent rapid development of the isogeometric analysis @xcite , which suppressed the meshing process ,",
    "has emphasised the significance of mesh automation in engineering design and analysis .",
    "quadtree in fea is a kind of hierarchical tree - based techniques for adaptive meshing of a 2d geometry @xcite .",
    "it discretises the geometry into a number of square cells of different size .",
    "the process is illustrated in fig.[fig : qtreerep1 ] using a circular domain .",
    "the geometry is first covered with a single square cell , also known as the root cell of the quadtree ( fig.[fig : qtreerep1]a ) . as shown in fig.[fig : qtreerep1]b , the root cell is subdivided into 4 equal - sized square cells and each of the cells is recursively subdivided to refine the mesh until certain termination criteria are reached . in this example , a cell is subdivided to better represent the boundary of the circle and the subdivision stops when the predefined maximum number of division is reached .",
    "the final mesh is obtained after deleting all the cells outside the domain ( fig.[fig : qtreerep1]c ) .",
    "the cell information is stored in a tree - type data structure , in which the root cell is at the highest level .",
    "it is common practice to limit the maximum difference of the division levels between two adjacent cells to one @xcite .",
    "this is referred to the @xmath0 rule and the resulting mesh is called a balanced @xcite or restricted quadtree mesh @xcite .",
    "a balanced quadtree mesh not only ensures there is no large size difference between adjacent cells , but also reduces the types of quadtree cells in a mesh to the 6 shown in fig.[fig : qtreecell ] . owing to its simplicity and large degree of flexibility",

    "_ hanging nodes _ middle nodes , shown as solid dots in fig.[fig : qtreerep ] , exist at the common edges between the adjacent cells with different division levels .",
    "when conventional quadrilateral finite elements are used , a middle node is connected to the two smaller elements ( lower level ) but not to the larger element ( higher level ) .",
    "this leads to incompatible displacement along the edges and the middle nodes are called the hanging nodes @xcite .",
    "fitting of curved boundary _ quadtree cells are composed of horizontal and vertical lines only . as shown in fig.[fig : qtreerep ] , the quadtree cells intersected with the curved boundary have to be further divided into smaller ones to improve the fitting of the boundary . generally ,",

    ", the boundary may still not be smooth ( fig.[fig : qtreerep1]c ) and may result in unrealistically high stresses .",
    "additional procedure is required to conform the mesh to the boundary .",
    "there exist a number of different approaches to ensure displacement compatibility when hanging nodes are present @xcite .",
    "three typical approaches among all are briefly discussed here .",
    "the first one is to subdivide the higher level quadtree cells next to a hanging node into smaller triangular elements @xcite as shown in fig[fig : qtreerep ] .",
    "additional nodes may be added to improve the mesh quality and/or reduce the number of element types .",
    "these techniques lead to a final mesh that only contains conforming triangular elements .",
    "a similar approach was adpoted by @xcite , in which the quadtree mesh was subdivided into a conforming mesh dominated by quadrilateral elements .",
    "the second approach introduces special conforming shape functions @xcite to ensure the displacement compatibility . an early work by gupta @xcite reported the development of a transition element that had additional node along its side .",
    "a conforming set of shape functions was derived based on the shape functions of the bilinear quadrilateral elements . owing to its simplicity and applicability , gupta s work",
    "was further extended by @xcite and @xcite to hexahedral elements .",
    "fries et al .",
    "@xcite investigated two approaches to handle the hanging nodes within the framework of the extended finite element method ( xfem ) .",
    "they were different in whether the enriched degrees - of - freedom ( dofs ) were assigned to the hanging node .",

    "tabarraei and sukumar @xcite in their work adapted their polygon element @xcite to quadtree mesh .",
    "the set of polygonal basis functions was derived using laplace interpolant . by using an affine map on the reference polygon",
    ", the conforming shape functions of a quadtree cell with the same number of vertices ( including the hanging nodes ) were obtained .",
    "they also reported a fast technique for computing the global stiffness matrix , making use of the quadtree structure by defining parent elements @xcite . in this way , the elemental stiffness matrix has to be computed only 15 times ( 4-node cell not included ) for a balanced quadtree mesh ( when @xmath0 rule is enforced ) .",
    "further development of their work with xfem was also reported in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in a recent paper @xcite , the development of high - order polygon elements received relatively less attention .",

    "besides dealing with the hanging nodes in a quadtree mesh , fitting complex boundaries is another challenging part in the mesh generation .",
    "@xcite proposed trimming the quadtree cells , intersected with the boundary , into polygons before a further subdivision process into triangles or quadrilaterals . alternatively those cells were first subdivided and some of the vertices were repositioned based on their projections onto the boundary @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite , after the subdivision",
    ", a buffer zone was introduced between the boundary and the internal quadtree cells .",
    "a compatible mesh was then constructed to fill up this zone .",
    "all these techniques require an additional optimisation step to ensure the final mesh quality . within the framework of xfem ,",
    "quadtree cells intersected with the boundary were not modified in pre - processing stage @xcite . however ,",
    "when constructing the stiffness matrix , the domain boundary is still required to identify the portion of the cell within the domain for numerical integration . in the integration process , that portion of the cell within the domain is either subdivided into geometric sub - cells @xcite or treated as a polygon @xcite .",
    "the scaled boundary finite element method ( sbfem ) provides an attractive alternate technique to construct polygon elements ( scaled boundary polygon ) @xcite ( fig.[fig : sbfempolygon ] ) .",
    "it is a semi - analytical procedure developed by song and wolf to solve boundary value problems @xcite .",

    "the number of line elements on an edge can be as many as required .",
    "any type of displacement - based line elements , including high - order spectral elements , can be used .",
    "the domain of the scaled boundary polygon is constructed by scaling from its scaling centre to its boundary , and the solution within the polygon is expressed semi - analytically @xcite .",
    "a salient feature of the scaled boundary polygons is that stress singularities occurring at crack and notch tips , formed by one or several materials , can be accurately modelled without resorting to asymptotic enrichment and local mesh refinement .",
    "its high accuracy and flexibility in mesh generation lead to simple remeshing procedures when modelling crack propagation @xcite .     scaled boundary representation of a polygon ]    scaled boundary representation of quadtree cells ]    this paper presents a technique for the stress and fracture analysis by integrating the scaled boundary finite element method ( sbfem ) with quadtree mesh of high - order elements .",
    "this integrated technique possesses the following features :    1 .   hanging nodes are treated without cell subdivision .",
    "each quadtree cell is modelled as a scaled boundary polygon as shown in fig.[fig : sbfequadtreerep ] .",
    "the edges of a quadtree cell can be divided into more than one line element to ensure displacement compatibility with the adjacent smaller cells .",
    "hanging - nodes are thus treated the same as other nodes .",

    "the boundary of the problem domain is defined using signed distance functions @xcite .",
    "only seed points @xcite are required to be predefined to control the mesh density .",
    "owing to the ability of the sbfem in constructing polygon elements of , practically , arbitrary shape and order , the quadtree cells trimmed by curved boundaries are simply treated as a non - square scaled boundary polygon .",
