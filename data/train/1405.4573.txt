    "<S> new heavy leptons with standard model gauge couplings have well - determined cross sections for pair production . </S>",
    "<S> a standard pattern of mass mixing implies that the most likely decays are @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly there have been no direct searches for heavy leptons with these decays at the lhc . however comparison with several multilepton searches allows us to set new limits on the heavy lepton masses . </S>",
    "<S> three observed excesses in the signal regions prevent us from setting stronger limits .      </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of a higgs particle at the lhc @xcite puts strong indirect constraints on the existence of new heavy fermions . </S>",
    "<S> a new charged lepton adds to the @xmath2 amplitude a contribution that is @xmath3 times the top contribution , which thus increases the destructive interference with the @xmath4 contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 width is then @xmath5 times smaller , but this result assumes that the higgs particle has standard couplings to both the new lepton and the top and that there are not other degrees of freedom contributing to the loop as well . to avoid dependence on such assumptions it is preferable to have direct limits rather than apparent indirect limits . </S>",
    "<S> also , a theory with a new sequential family of leptons and quarks where these assumptions are not correct and where a higgs - like scalar can have higgs - like widths has been presented in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we choose to focus on the case of an extra chiral doublet of leptons @xmath6 with standard model gauge couplings . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath7 has a mass that is many orders of magnitude larger than the light neutrinos , its overlap with the flavor eigenstates of the light neutrinos should be extremely small . </S>",
    "<S> this is unlike the mass mixing between the three light neutrinos that can be responsible for the large mixing angles observed in the leptonic charged currents . </S>",
    "<S> the charged current mixing between @xmath8 or @xmath9 and the lighter leptons on the other hand must be due to the mass mixing in the charged lepton sector . </S>",
    "<S> here we expect the @xmath8 flavor eigenstate to have its largest mass mixing with the @xmath10 flavor eigenstate , since this would mimic the mixing pattern in the similarly hierarchical quark sector . </S>",
    "<S> then at least one of @xmath6 has a dominant decay to a third family lepton . </S>",
    "<S> for example if @xmath11 and if there is a sufficiently large mass splitting and/or a sufficiently small mixing angle then the dominant decays are @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> pair production of heavy leptons then produces many different multilepton ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) final states with kinematics quite different from current heavy lepton searches .    </S>",
    "<S> the current mass limits from lep are 80.5 gev ( 90.3 gev ) for a majorana ( dirac ) @xmath7 decaying to @xmath16 and 101.9 gev ( or 100.8 gev ) for @xmath17 decaying to @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . we will be able to use lhc data to exclude a range of mass combinations above these limits . </S>",
    "<S> this is in lieu of a dedicated search for the simplest leptonic extension of the standard model , which surprisingly still remains to be done . </S>",
    "<S> an even simpler though less motivated search is possible if one assumes that @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the dominant decay . </S>",
    "<S> this was considered in @xcite where it was found that a @xmath17 mass up to at least 250 gev would be excluded very early with 1 fb@xmath22 of data . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the corresponding limit with present data would be at least 600 gev . here again no dedicated search has been reported . </S>",
    "<S> exotic vectorlike leptons have both nonstandard production and decay modes and constraints on such leptons as inferred from lhc multilepton searches are presented in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vectorlike leptons may also decay predominately to @xmath10s @xcite , but the decays typically also involve @xmath23 and @xmath24 .      </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the case @xmath11 and with the decays already mentioned we have the following processes : @xmath25 we do not consider the single production of a heavy lepton since the production cross section depends on an unknown mixing angle . at @xmath26 tev with @xmath27 gev and @xmath28 gev , the three pair production cross sections are @xmath29 fb , @xmath30 fb and @xmath31 fb . we include an additional @xmath32 factor of @xmath33 , as indicated by including one - loop corrections in sherpa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections are in the 150- to 4600-fb range for the range of heavy lepton and neutrino masses we consider in this analysis </S>",
    "<S> .    the @xmath7 mass can be either majorana or dirac or some mixture . </S>",
    "<S> the pure majorana case arises when the @xmath34 state is absent . , which may be helpful to offset other new physics ( typically positive ) contributions . </S>",
    "<S> a 150 gev mass produces a shift in @xmath35 of at least @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> ] in this case the @xmath7 can decay via @xmath37 or @xmath38 and so the decay chains are @xmath39 we find the branching fractions to various leptonic final states as shown in table [ bf ln ] . </S>",
    "<S> the most promising channels for detection have three or four leptons since these channels have small backgrounds .    </S>",
    "<S> .branching fractions and decay products ( @xmath21 ) . [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the case where the @xmath9 mass is dirac , its decay no longer produces @xmath10s of both signs and its pair production cross section is roughly twice the size of the majorana @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> however the @xmath40 branching fractions to four leptons are small and so the increase in total number of four - lepton events would hardly be significant . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in three - lepton events is larger , but on the other hand for @xmath41 production there is an increase in the branching fraction to an opposite sign same flavor ( ossf ) lepton pair and the three - lepton searches we consider have cuts related to ossf pairs . in any case the somewhat larger signals for the dirac case means that the majorana case provides limits for both cases .    if @xmath42 then the decays are @xmath43 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this has the effect that @xmath10s are replaced by @xmath45s in the final states . </S>",
    "<S> the four - lepton signal is much smaller since it only comes from neutrino pair production in this case , but the three - lepton signal can still be substantial .    </S>",
    "<S> thus far we have assumed that the mixing angle that allows direct decays to @xmath10 or @xmath45 is very small . for a larger mixing angle , for instance @xmath46 , </S>",
    "<S> the branching fractions of the heavier lepton are a sensitive function of @xmath47 when this is smaller than @xmath48 . for small enough @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> the decay @xmath49 can dominate when @xmath11 , and the decay @xmath50 can dominate when @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> in the first case the branching to four leptons is the result of @xmath40 decays only and the signal is greatly diminished . </S>",
    "<S> the three - lepton branching fraction is also reduced . in the second case </S>",
    "<S> the branching fraction to three leptons is somewhat larger since @xmath10s have a larger leptonic branching fraction than @xmath4s . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we give results both for when the mixing angle is very small and when it is 0.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the former corresponds to the limit when the heavier lepton decays to the lighter of the new leptons for any nonvanishing mass difference .      </S>",
    "<S> usually multilepton signals are considered in searches for supersymmetric or other exotic particles which then influences the event selection criteria . </S>",
    "<S> when colored particles decay to leptons the requirements related to the expected high jet @xmath52 reduce sensitivity to our signal since the jets in our final states are somewhat soft . </S>",
    "<S> high missing energy cuts and lepton @xmath52 requirements also reduce the sensitivity , especially for smaller neutrino masses and/or mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a low sensitivity search would be the cms search for same - sign leptons and jets @xcite where the combination of cuts on the scalar sum @xmath53 of transverse jet momentum and on the missing energy @xmath54 reduce our signal to approximately the size of the error on the background . </S>",
    "<S> another example is the @xmath55 @xcite search where the lepton @xmath52 and invariant mass selections reduce our signal to a very small number of events in the search region .    </S>",
    "<S> there are dedicated searches for exotic heavy leptons such as seesaw triplet leptons @xmath56 produced via @xmath57 . here </S>",
    "<S> atlas and cms usually assume that the triplet lepton masses are degenerate and that the heavy leptons decay predominately to light leptons @xcite ( as may also be applicable to composite models @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> . in our case these searches may only be marginally sensitive to our final states . </S>",
    "<S> cms also has a search for the single production of a heavy majorana neutrino via @xmath58 ( @xmath21 ) @xcite , but this production cross section is sensitive to an unknown and likely very small mixing angle . the heavy right - handed neutrino search @xcite has high lepton @xmath52 cuts and invariant mass cuts that are not appropriate for our signal . </S>",
    "<S> none of these searches have explored the case where the dominate decay of the heavy neutrino is @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are searches with moderate cuts and small enough backgrounds that are sensitive to our signal ; in order of increasing sensitivity there are the searches for higgs associated production where @xmath60 @xcite , the atlas anomalous three - lepton search @xcite , the cms anomalous three or more leptons search @xcite , and the atlas four or more leptons susy search @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for each search we outline which cuts have been considered and then estimate our signal based on those cuts for a range of heavy lepton mass combinations . </S>",
    "<S> by comparing to the data we can determine the excluded mass combinations .    </S>",
    "<S> we use herwig@xmath61 2.7.0 @xcite interfaced with a feynrules @xcite new physics model to handle the production , decay and showering of the events . </S>",
    "<S> we feed the fully showered events through the detector simulator delphes @xmath62 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the default atlas and cms delphes cards modified with the lepton isolation cuts appropriate to the particular searches we consider . </S>",
    "<S> then madanalysis @xmath63 @xcite is used to incorporate the key kinematic cuts to allow us to compare with the experimental results .    </S>",
    "<S> the program checkmate @xcite provides a streamlined framework to compare model predictions against a certain set of validated atlas and cms analyses , although none of the searches we investigate are in this set . included in this framework is a version of delphes 3 modified with various efficiency formulas that more closely match the characteristics of the two experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we were able to slightly modify the checkmate delphes to interface it with madanalysis 5 and to use the lepton isolation cuts appropriate to our searches . </S>",
    "<S> the two versions of delphes gave quite similar results , except as noted below . </S>",
    "<S> in the cases they differ we adopt the implied normalization from checkmate .      </S>",
    "<S> the cms search @xcite puts limits on the @xmath65 cross section with the 8 tev 19.5 fb@xmath22 data set . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath66 channel with no ossf pairs has a small background and is the most sensitive to our signal . for this channel </S>",
    "<S> we consider the following selection criteria :    * the leading lepton has @xmath67 gev and additional leptons have @xmath68 gev . * </S>",
    "<S> the sum of charge of the three leptons is @xmath69 . * </S>",
    "<S> the smallest invariant mass of two leptons is @xmath70 gev and the smallest distance between oppositely charged leptons is @xmath71 . * missing energy @xmath72 gev . * a jet veto ( no jet with @xmath73 gev ) .    as a check on our results we use herwig++ to estimate the number of events for @xmath65 production satisfying the selection criteria above . in the @xmath74 </S>",

    "<S> is reduced in this region and we would expect only approximately two or three events .    </S>",
    "<S> we mention that for this analysis a serious discrepancy occurred between checkmate ( the results of which we have quoted ) and the original delphes . </S>",
    "<S> the latter gives a signal estimate approximately three times larger and so here again our limits can be seen as conservative .    the similar atlas search @xcite has somewhat more relaxed jet requirements and so potentially this search could be more sensitive to our signal . </S>",
    "<S> but the equivalent channel of interest , the @xmath23-depleted channel , has an excess ( nine events observed , @xmath80 events expected ) . </S>",

    "<S> we have investigated the multilepton signals for a new heavy doublet of leptons with nonexotic quantum numbers . a standard pattern of mass mixing following that in the quark sector would mean that the new doublet mixes mostly with the third family leptons . </S>",
    "<S> the most accessible multilepton signatures occur when the dominant decays are @xmath120 and @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> there is no dedicated search at the lhc for heavy leptons with these decays . </S>",
    "<S> instead the heavy lepton searches have so far focused on more exotic decays such as charged lepton decays to @xmath122 or @xmath123 ( @xmath124 or @xmath15 ) for the most part , and heavy neutrino decays to @xmath125 . at this time these searches are not particularly sensitive to our signal .    </S>",

    "<S> none of these excesses are individually very significant , but our signal would produce a small number of events in these searches while still remaining consistent with the limits we have obtained . </S>",

    "<S> a different origin for new multilepton events typically results in a different pattern of excesses . as an example we mentioned earlier heavy leptons that decay directly to @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> since the lower limit on the masses of such leptons are constrained to be much higher , the jets are more energetic and less likely to pass the jet - related cut in the @xmath65 search . in the four - lepton search </S>",

    "<S> . for example it would be more appropriate if the missing energy cut was 50 rather than 100 gev . in the case of four leptons </S>",
    "<S> it may be that a search more optimized for our signal would have a loose @xmath23 veto ( such as no ossf pairs within @xmath129 gev ) and a loose missing energy cut ( such as @xmath130 gev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been quite extensive searches for new sequential quarks with decays to third family quarks and so the absence of searches for new sequential leptons with decays to third family leptons is odd . from our results </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that a dedicated multilepton search could close this gap , clear up the status of some excesses and further improve on the mass bounds for such leptons . </S>"
