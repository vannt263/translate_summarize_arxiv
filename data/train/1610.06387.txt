    "linear diophantine equations and their systems are easy to solve .",
    "there are three possibilities : either a system has no solution , one solution or infinitely many solutions . the case of one solution can be thought of as a special case of infinitely many solutions .",
    "the method to distinguish the particular cases is known  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  1 ) and",
    "the issue can often be decided by inspection ( by a heuristic search for at least one solution ) .",
    "this can be contrasted with the case of a general diophantine equation , or its system , where the decision whether a solution exists belongs to hard problems .",
    "focusing on the linear case from now on , if a system has infinitely many solutions it may be of an interest to investigate the total number of nonnegative solutions .",
    "the answer is necessarily a finite number .",
    "one such a system appeared in the author s recent work  @xcite    [ eq : diophantine ] @xmath1    where @xmath2 such that @xmath3 is even .",
    "its importance comes from the fact that it is closely related to counting the number of feynman diagrams for a wide class of boson models in interacting quantum field theory .",
    "the linear equations in  ( [ eq : diophantine ] ) are one of those cases where for a given @xmath4 one can quickly find a solution and conclude that the number of solutions for @xmath5 is infinite .",
    "it is only slightly less obvious to see whether the system itself has zero or infinitely many solutions ( any of the four equations in   imposes a constraint on a solution for the remaining three equations ) .    the closed expression for the total number of _ nonnegative _ solutions proved to be a pertinacious problem to pursue and we present its derivation .",
    "we simplify the system by considering @xmath6 ( both even and odd ) but , as will become clear , our counting ( proof ) strategy can be used to count the solutions for different @xmath4 if there is a need for it .",
    "also , by setting @xmath7 the number of nonnegative solutions of the resulting linear system is interesting on its own and turns out to be related to floyd s triangle  http://oeis.org/a006003 [ ] and the row , column and diagonal sum of the normal magic square of order @xmath8 ( called the magic constant ) .",
    "the problems related to linear diophantine equations and their systems often appear in the theory of integer programming  @xcite , lattice counting  @xcite and combinatorics  @xcite .",

    "there exist several algorithms for lattice point counting which can be used to obtain the same result we got here . for a single - variable problem ( @xmath9 ) one only needs to know the polynomial order and the first few solutions to find the polynomial for any @xmath8 by using , for example , the lagrange method . for multivariate problems , such as the original system",

    "it follows that there is @xmath93 segments between the intersection points of these two lines with the axis @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",

    "one type intersects @xmath95 points and the other passes through @xmath96 points .",
    "this can be seen in the following way .",
    "the diagonal strip boundaries intersect @xmath92 at two points whose @xmath38 coordinates are @xmath97 and @xmath98 . their distance ( projected onto the @xmath38 or @xmath39 axis ) is @xmath99 but because these are odd coordinates no solution can lie on any vertical or horizontal line passing through them .",
    "the closest ` even ' points inside the strip are one segment away ( from each ` odd ' point ) and that is how we got the @xmath100 points above .",
    "thus , the neighboring reciprocal hyperplane passes through @xmath96 points . since we counted the number of hyperplanes to be @xmath101",

    "the @xmath104 parameter is set up such that it takes the corresponding values from the interval @xmath90 governing the multiplicity factor .",

    "the upper diagonal strip boundary intersects the @xmath39 axis at @xmath99 and the line @xmath92 intersects the axis at @xmath106 .",
    "so there is @xmath101 vertices with nonnegative solutions .",
    "every time @xmath38 increases by two we get two points less and from the previous paragraph the maximal value of @xmath38 is @xmath107 .",
    "hence there is @xmath108 vertical axes . for @xmath65",
    "the situation is verbatim where instead of vertical hyperplanes we study horizontal hyperplanes in the mirror image across the diagonal .",
    "hence , the number of solutions reads @xmath109 summing eqs .",
    "and   we obtain  . for @xmath75",
    "the strip becomes a diagonal line .",
    "the counting with the help of vertical and horizontal line goes through in exactly the same way leading to  eq .  .",
    "the diagonal solutions are , however , doubly counted since the strip is degenerate and must be subtracted .",
    "this is precisely the first term of eq .  .",
    "therefore , for the number of solutions we get  .      starting with @xmath80 and @xmath105 , the sum @xmath111 is bounded only by   together with @xmath112 .",

    "there are two more vertices on the line given by @xmath92 .",
    "it is advantageous to let the vertical hyperplanes ( recall that @xmath105 is being considered ) count until they hit @xmath92 and then subtract the inadmissible solutions ",
    "those above the ` cut - off ' line @xmath117 .",
    "the cut - off line is always @xmath114 since @xmath39 can reach it but can not go higher ( @xmath112 ) satisfies constraint   unless @xmath118 which , however , corresponds to @xmath43 solved as a separate case . ] .",
    "hence , for the number of solutions we get @xmath119 where the first term is identical to   and the upper bound in the second sum is given by counting the inadmissible solutions : we set @xmath113 in @xmath92 , find @xmath39 and calculate @xmath120 . so the number of vertices on the @xmath39 axis is @xmath121 leading to the sum s upper bound .",
    "it is also the expression in the parenthesis where the @xmath104 variable is set up such that vertical hyperplanes with the decreasing number of solutions ( by one ) are assigned the correct multiplicity factors ( in the form of the triangle numbers ) as revealed in lemma  [ lem : diosimsystem ] .",
    "the factor of two again accounts for the solutions from mirror image situation on the other side of the strip for @xmath122 ( using horizontal hyperplanes ) .",
    "counting in the strip is the same as in  .",
    "this is because the cut - off line never violates the points inside the strip .",
    "the cut - off line @xmath114 intersects @xmath92 at @xmath123 .",
    "by inserting this value to the upper diagonal strip boundary @xmath124 we can see that the cut - off line can not even get to the strip boundary .",

    "contrary to @xmath45 we will use the reciprocal hyperplanes ( just one to be precise ) to count the solutions .",

    "the multiplicity is now based on  @xmath38 and taking into account doubling from the same argument for @xmath122 the number of solutions lying on   reads @xmath133 summing   and   we get  .    for @xmath75 the strip intersections with",
    "is just a point and we simply add   and   resulting in  .",

    "as before , the lowest cut - off is @xmath135 and it intersects   at @xmath136 , that is , precisely at the intersection boundary given by @xmath124 .",

    "as we approach the strip , @xmath38 increases by two with each lattice segment .",

    "this is because for any such triple we get a triple of @xmath5 via  .",
    "contrary to the original system   there are no multiplicities and this significantly simplifies the counting .",
    "the rhs of   splits into two cases when @xmath87 and @xmath128 .",
    "the counting of admissible triples @xmath228 in   is invariant w.r.t .",
    "the relabelling @xmath168 and so the number of solutions for @xmath165 equals that of @xmath80 .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath36 , the number of solutions for the first case of   is @xmath229 and in the second case it is @xmath230 in the geometric picture what we did is to count the number of points lying on a line between two endpoints .",
    "we divided by two because the values of @xmath47 are a multiple of two and added one not to omit a boundary point .",
    "two cases must be distinguished .",
    "we use the simple fact that @xmath231 in the following text . considering the previously mentioned symmetry and  , there are four cases to investigate in this section . for @xmath75 and @xmath87",
    "we get from   @xmath232 similarly , for @xmath75 and @xmath128 we find from   @xmath233 the factor @xmath234 comes from finding the ` smallest ' solution for @xmath75 and @xmath128 which is @xmath235 .",
    "then , the distance between @xmath236 and @xmath237 is @xmath238 giving us @xmath234 after dividing by two and adding one ( a boundary point ) .",
    "for @xmath87 and @xmath80 we get @xmath239 the second term counts the number of points lying between @xmath87 and @xmath240 .",
    "the smallest @xmath161 consistent with the last case ( @xmath128 and @xmath80 ) is @xmath241 ( follows from minimally saturating the inequalities : @xmath242 and @xmath243 for @xmath244 and extracting @xmath161 ) . then , for every @xmath161 from @xmath245 to its maximal value ( equal to @xmath8 ) we find the corresponding @xmath101 .",
    "this can be done in the following way . by solving for @xmath101 and inserting it to the second equation",
    "we get @xmath246 ( @xmath244 gives us the previous minimal saturation ) .",
    "since @xmath161 increases by two , the closest allowed value after @xmath247 is @xmath248 . by recalling @xmath249 it follows that there are now three possibilities : @xmath250 and for every increment of @xmath251 by four we add two more solutions .",
    "this gives us the necessary counting and taking into account   we may write @xmath252 the inner upper / lower bound is calculated from @xmath253 .",

    "we get   from @xmath256 .",
    "the factors of two account for the number of solutions for @xmath165 which is equal to the studied case @xmath80 .",
    "we again tacitly use @xmath257 .",
    "the derivation is very similar so let us stress common points and noteworthy differences .",
    "essentially , the main difference comes from the fact that the boundaries @xmath75 and @xmath258 ( leading to the split to four cases ) intersect at @xmath259 which is odd .",
    "but the values of @xmath225 are never odd in our problem and so it is mostly about adjusting the sums bounds ( to be shifted by one to start / end counting at an even point ) .",
    "so for @xmath75 and @xmath87 we now get @xmath260 ( @xmath261 is the last even point consistent with the inequalities ) . for @xmath75 and @xmath128",
    "the smallest solution is now @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "thus @xmath264 in the case @xmath87 and @xmath80 the counting argument goes through exactly like for   except that in order to satisfy the inequalities we stop the counting of @xmath101 on the last even number ( which is @xmath265 ) @xmath266 finally , for @xmath128 and @xmath80 , we get   as well but to get to the closest admissible even @xmath161 for @xmath174 we have to shift it by one : @xmath267 recalling @xmath268 , we get two minimally saturating solutions ( @xmath269 ) and as before , by increasing @xmath161 by two , two more solutions are always added .",
    "hence @xmath270 where the outer lower bound comes from the rhs of   for the minimal solutions .",
    "for the inner bounds we get the same expressions like in   but the derivation is modified by realizing that there are two minimal solutions @xmath271 for the minmal @xmath272 .",
    "we again get   from @xmath273 .",
    "we conclude this work with several remarks . we found a closed expression counting the number of nonnegative solutions of linear diophantine system of equations   for @xmath274 and for its special case of @xmath213 .",
    "the main linear system is motivated by counting the perturbative contributions for an interaction lagrangian in interacting quantum field theory for bosons .",
    "in particular , the number of nonnegative solutions is closely related to counting the feynman diagrams for two interacting fields in the scalar @xmath0 model to an arbitrary perturbative order  @xcite .    it would be quite interesting to generalize the presented result to a linear system given by generalizing   in the following way : @xmath275 for @xmath276 .",
    "this would provide a very general counting method of feynman diagrams for an arbitrary number of interacting fields , to an arbitrary perturbative order and for any scalar @xmath0 model of interacting bosons .",
