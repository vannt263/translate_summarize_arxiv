    "the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; @xcite ) is a large - scale survey for gravitational lenses among flat - spectrum radio sources .",
    "the primary goals of class are to find lenses which may be suitable for determinations of the hubble constant , @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and to study the lensing rate in a large , homogeneous sample in order to place limits on the cosmological constant , @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "over 12,000 sources have been observed with the vla in three sessions ",
    "the first in the spring of 1994 ( class  1 ; @xmath113300 sources ) , the second in the summer of 1995 ( class  2 ; @xmath114500 sources ) and the third in the spring of 1998 ( class  3 ; @xmath115000 sources ) .",
    "the vast majority of flat - spectrum radio sources are dominated by emission from a single compact core ; all class sources containing multiple compact components are selected as gravitational lens candidates , amounting to 50  100 candidates in each phase of the survey .",
    "these are followed up with high resolution radio imaging using merlin ; the best surviving candidates are then imaged using the vlba . during this procedure",
    ", the majority of vla candidates are rejected based on surface brightness and morphology criteria .",
    "the candidates that survive the radio filters are then investigated further with optical and/or infrared imaging , spectroscopy and more radio imaging . by these means",
    "we have discovered 11 new lenses in the survey , in addition to the one reported here .",
    "we are investigating an additional @xmath1125 promising lens candidates .",

    "the data were calibrated using standard aips routines , and maps were made using difmap ( @xcite ) . at the frequencies above 1.4  ghz , the source can be characterized as five point components , with no significant extended structure .",
    "hence , the maps were made by fitting five point components to the data and then repeating a cycle of model - fitting and phase self - calibration .",
    "the self - calibration time scale was set to the length of the individual scans at each frequency .",
    "both the positions and the flux densities were allowed to vary in the model fitting . at 1.4  ghz",
    "the beam size is large compared to the component separation , so the model fitting was done by fixing the component positions at their 8.5  ghz values and varying only the component flux densities . in addition , there were confusing sources in the 1.4  ghz map that had to be included as components in the model .",

    "magnitudes were calculated using both the daophot package ( @xcite ) in iraf and the sextractor package ( @xcite ) .",
    "first , the magnitudes of the three bright lensed images were calculated using 026 diameter apertures .",
    "next , an empirical psf , constructed from radial profiles of stars in the field , was fitted to the emission from the lensed images and the star near the lensing galaxy .",

    "the aperture diameter corresponds to 7.9@xmath28  kpc at the redshift of the lens .",
    "the photfnu header card was used to convert count rates in the image into flux densities into janskys and then a vega zero - point of 1087  jy was assumed to get the f160w magnitudes . for comparison with the nirc photometry ( see below ) , the magnitude of the `` arc '' defined by the three lensed images of the background source was also computed .",

    "this is not surprising since component d should be @xmath31 fainter than a.    it is considerably more difficult to do photometry on the nirc images because the seeing disk is large compared to the component separations . instead of finding magnitudes of the individual lensed images , the magnitude of the `` arc ''",
    "was calculated by centering a rectangular aperture of width 09 and height 18 on the `` arc . ''",
    "the sky was estimated from regions directly to the north , west and south of the aperture .",
    "once again , the daophot package was used to subtract the emission from the lensed images and the star from the data before the lens galaxy magnitude was calculated .",

    "no other broad emission features are seen in the spectrum , which ranges from 4300 to nearly 9400 .",

    "no line was seen at this position , although the sensitivity in this part of the spectrum is low and the presence of a weak line is not ruled out . other possible identifications for the observed emission line ( e.g. , h@xmath52 , ] , , ly@xmath53 ) would imply the presence of strong emission lines in parts of the spectrum in which the signal - to - noise ratio is high , none",
    "of which we see .",
    "we conclude that the line is correctly identified and the source lies at redshift @xmath540.01 , where the uncertainty in the redshift is estimated from uncertainties in finding the line centroid in both the emitted and the observed frames .",
    "in order for a lens system to be used to measure @xmath9 , the background source must be variable so that time delays can be measured .",
    "we use two methods to search for evidence of variability in the background source in b2045 + 265 .",
    "the first is to examine the component flux density ratios at different epochs .",
    "the ratios are not affected by errors in the absolute flux calibration and so any detected changes in the flux density ratios reflect actual changes in the flux density of the background source .",
    "a comparison of the 8.5  ghz observations made in september 1995 with those made in december 1996 shows small changes in the ratios of the component flux densities , but not at a significant level .",
    "the second method is to monitor the total 22  ghz flux density of the b2045 + 265 lens system .",
    "daily observations of the system were made with the 40  m telescope of the owens valley radio observatory during the periods 1996 may 18 ",
    "september 03 and 1996 november 04  22 .",
    "the data were calibrated using the cmbprog package ( @xcite ) . a 15% @xmath24",
    "3% change in total flux density was observed in november 1996 over a period of less than a week . because several other sources being monitored showed no change in flux density during the same period",
    ", the observed change in flux density may indicate variability in the background source .",
    "however , it is also possible that the detected variability is due to changes in component e , which has a radio spectrum that is flatter that that of the lensed images . to determine which of the components is varying requires high angular resolution monitoring of the system with the vla .",
    "the detection of five unresolved radio components in the b2045 + 265 system raises the possibility that component e is the fifth lensed image of the background source .",
    "we believe , however , that component e is instead associated with the lensing galaxy .",
    "although standard lensing models can produce five images in configurations similar to that seen in the b2045 + 265 system ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the central fifth image tends to be highly demagnified with respect to the other images .",
    "this behavior is not seen in b2045 + 265 ; in fact , component e is brighter than component d at high frequencies .",
    "in addition , the radio spectrum of component e ( figs .  [ fig_radio_spec ] and [ fig_flux_ratio ] ) differs sufficiently from the spectra of the other four components to suggest that component e is not related to the other components .",
    "finally , the radio emission of component e is spatially coincident with the infrared emission from the lensing galaxy ( see  [ nicobs ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that component e is indeed associated with the lensing galaxy .",
    "it thus appears that we have discovered a radio galaxy lensing a radio - loud quasar .",
    "of previously known lens systems , only 2016 + 112 ( @xcite ) may have radio emission associated with a lensing galaxy .",
    "however , recent observations of 2016 + 112 suggest that the radio emission of its component c1 may be lensed emission from a ( separate ) background source ( @xcite ) .    the flat radio spectrum of component e in b2045 + 265 is typical of an active galactic nucleus .",
    "if component e is , indeed , associated with the lensing galaxy , then the radio position of e gives an accurate location for the nucleus of the lensing galaxy .",
    "the location of the center of the lensing galaxy relative to the lensed images is a key component in models of the lensing potential ( see  [ model ] ) .",
    "an _ a priori _ knowledge of the relative position of the center of the lensing galaxy provides strong constraints on lens models .",
    "we model the lens potential as a singular isothermal sphere potential with `` mixed '' shear ( @xcite ) , in which the scaled lensing potential can be expressed as : @xmath55 locations in the image plane relative to the lens center are given by @xmath56",
    ". the critical radius of the isothermal sphere is given by @xmath57 , and @xmath58  and @xmath59 give the magnitude of the shear and its position angle .",

    "the polar coordinates are defined in the usual way , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this results in a _ left - handed _ coordinate system .",
    "although the image positions are defined relative to the position of component a , they are treated as absolute positions .",
    "thus , both the lens position @xmath64  and source position @xmath65 are included as parameters in the model .",
    "we assume that component e marks the nucleus of the lensing galaxy and fix the lens position at that location , leaving five varying parameters and eight observational constraints ( @xmath66  and @xmath67  for each of the four images ) .",

    "the positional errors are defined to be the 8.5  ghz beam size divided by the signal - to - noise ratio of the component in the 8.5  ghz map . to avoid biases introduced by the choice of starting values",
    ", we repeat the process with a grid of choices of initial conditions containing @xmath71 values , where @xmath72  is the number of varying parameters in the model fitting .",

    "the observed flux density ratios , however , are difficult to reproduce with a simple model such as the one presented above . although this simple model is adequate to recover the four image positions , it does not reproduce the relative magnifications of images a , b , c. the reason for this is easy to see .",
    "if , as we have assumed , the potential is smooth , then we can perform a taylor expansion of it about the location of image b. if we approximate the images as collinear , then the highest order essential terms in this expansion are quadratic in the coordinate perpendicular to the a  c line and quartic parallel to this line .",
    "higher order terms are , by assumption , ignorable .",
    "it is then possible to show that in the limit of small image separations there are several scaling laws including @xmath79 , i.e. , the flux of the central image approaches the sum of the fluxes of the other two images ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is clearly violated in this source , which indicates strongly that the potential is not smooth on the scale of the a ",
    "c image separation .    in order to improve upon our model ,",
    "we have introduced higher order terms in the potential such as might be produced by a local mass perturbation .",
    "specifically we expand the potential around images a and c to third order along the a ",
    "c line and to fourth order around image b. we then impose continuity of the potential and its first two derivatives midway between a and b and midway between b and c. there are then three observable quantities , the ratio of the image separations and the ratios of the image fluxes , that can be used to solve for the coefficients in these taylor expansions . performing",
    "this exercise leads to the conclusion that adding a small , positive mass perturbation centered on a point located 011 from b towards c suffices to recover the flux ratios as well as the image locations .",
    "( this perturbation might be caused by a spiral arm , for example ( cf @xcite ) ) .",
    "the ratio of the ( almost certainly unmeasurable ) time delays @xmath80 is now found to be 0.2 ; however , the delay @xmath81 should be quite robust to this perturbation within a given global model . in conclusion ,",
    "none of the existing observations challenge the gravitational lens interpretation that we present here .",
    "properties of the lensing galaxy can be derived by using the fact that it is acting as a gravitational lens .",
    "for example , the mass within the einstein ring of a lens is ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the angular radius of the einstein ring and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are the angular diameter distances between observer and lens , observer and source and lens and source , respectively .",
    "the angular diameter distance between two objects at @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath90 where @xmath91^{-1/2}}\\ ] ] and @xmath92 is defined as @xmath93 for @xmath94 , @xmath66 for @xmath95 , or @xmath96 for @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath98 terms are defined in the standard fashion : @xmath99 the integral @xmath100 has an analytic solution for @xmath101 , and if @xmath102 the angular diameter distance acquires the simple form @xmath103    for b2045 + 265 , the lens redshift is secure .",
    "the source redshift , based on one emission line , is less certain .",
    "for this reason , we express the physical quantities derived in this section as functions of the source redshift .",
    "we will also assume , for ease of discussion , an einstein - de  sitter cosmology .",
    "the effects of varying the source redshift and the cosmological model are presented in table  [ tab_lenspars ] .",

    "the speed of a particle moving in a circular orbit ( @xmath110 ) at the einstein ring radius is derived from @xmath108 by assuming that the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy is an isothermal sphere .",
    "a simple calculation is used to convert @xmath108 to the mass inside the sphere of radius @xmath109 .",
    "the value for @xmath110 follows directly from the mass inside the sphere .",
    "the luminosity of the lens inside @xmath109 can be estimated by converting its @xmath6 magnitude to rest - frame @xmath111 and @xmath112 magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath113-correction for the lens redshift and rest - frame ( @xmath114 ) and ( @xmath115 ) colors for typical sa galaxies are taken from poggianti ( 1997 ) .",
    "the resulting luminosities are @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath7 band mass - to - light ratio becomes @xmath118 .",
    "inserting the source redshift derived from the optical spectra (  [ optspec ] ) yields a lens mass of @xmath119 within the einstein ring radius ( @xmath120  kpc at the redshift of the lens ) .",
    "this mass implies a circular velocity at @xmath109 of 570  km / sec , two to three times the velocities seen in both nearby ( e.g. , @xcite ) and more distant ( @xmath121 ; @xcite ) spiral galaxies .",
    "the einstein ring mass - to - light ratios are @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "these mass - to - light ratios are not unusual for lens systems ( e.g. , fig .  7 of @xcite ) , although they are higher than expected given the redshift of the lens and assumptions about the luminosity evolution of lens galaxies ( keeton et al .",
    "the large lensing mass required to produce the observed image separation is a result of the relative closeness of the background source to the lens in redshift space .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the unusually high projected mass .",
    "compact groups of galaxies associated with the primary lensing galaxies have been discovered in recent observations of two lens systems ( 1115 + 080 and b1422 + 231 ; kundi et al .  1997a , b ; @xcite ) .",
    "we are conducting observations of the b2045 + 265 field to search for evidence of a group associated with the lensing galaxy ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_k_mos ] ) . the high contamination rate by field galaxies ( @xmath1185% at @xmath124 ; @xcite",
    ") , however , makes high - redshift groups difficult to detect .",
    "if such a group exists and is gravitationally bound , its gravitational potential can enhance the image splitting by the lensing galaxy .",
    "in such a scenario , we would overestimate the mass of the lensing galaxy .",
    "another explanation for the high projected mass inside the einstein ring is that the lens may be one of a close pair of possibly merging galaxies .",
    "this situation has been observed in the case of the class lens 1608 + 656 .",
    "the initial observations revealed an einstein ring projected mass of @xmath125 , corresponding to @xmath126 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "later hst imaging showed that the lens is composed of a very close pair of galaxies , explaining the high mass and ellipticity required for the 1608 + 656 system ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are unable to determine unequivocally whether two galaxies are present in the b2045 + 265 system because the sensitivity of our nicmos observation is too low .",
    "more sensitive nicmos and wfpc2 observations of b2045 + 265 are needed to test the two - galaxy hypothesis .",
    "a third possibility is that the source redshift or the assumed cosmology ( or both ) are in error .",
    "we examine the results of varying the source redshift by assigning different identifications to the emission line seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_source ] .",
    "we then re - calculate the physical parameters associated with the lens in three different cosmological models : @xmath127 ( 1 , 0 ) , ( 0.2 , 0 ) , and ( 0.2 , 0.8 ) .",
    "we find that the effects of changing @xmath128 are larger than those produced by changing the cosmological model . of the alternative identifications of the emission line in the source spectrum , the choice of ly@xmath53 produces lens galaxy properties that are the closest to those associated with normal nearby spirals ( table  [ tab_lenspars ] ) .",
    "however , no sign of a ly@xmath53 forest is seen on the short - wavelength side of the emission line , even after subtracting the estimated contribution of the lens galaxy from the source spectrum . the absence of other emission lines in the spectrum (  [ optspec ] ) and the lack of a ly@xmath53 forest argue against the identification of the emission line as ly@xmath53 .",
    "more sensitive spectroscopy of this system must be conducted to determine the source redshift unambiguously .",

    "this may imply that there is a significant amount of dark matter associated with this galaxy , that the lens actually consists of a close pair of galaxies , or that the overall mass distribution of an associated group of galaxies is contributing to the lensing potential .",

    "we have obtained high dynamic range vlba observations which can be used to search for this possible extended mas - scale structure .",
